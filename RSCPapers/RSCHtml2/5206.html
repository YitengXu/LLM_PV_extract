      <h2 id="sect518"><span class="a_heading">1 Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>This is the latest review covering the topic of advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials. It follows on from last year’s review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> and is part of the Atomic Spectrometry Updates series.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2–6</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">This year’s review period has seen a significant upturn in the number of relevant papers. Increases in number for most sections were noted. An especially large increase was observed for the forensic sections. It was therefore decided to devote a section to forensic applications rather than have several sub-sections spread throughout the review. Since the ideal scenario is to leave the sample as undamaged as possible so that it may be used in the future, most of the forensic applications used non-destructive techniques such as assorted X-ray-based techniques or minimally damaging ones, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LA or LIBS. This is common to cultural heritage samples too. Another aspect common to many sections is the significant use of chemometric packages to aid classification/identification. The fuels section was again noted for significant re-invention of wheels or the lack of validation for many papers. The analysis of nanostructures has become commonplace over the last few years. This has largely moved on from the method development of single particle ICP-MS to real-life applications and encompasses more than just engineered nanoparticles. Applications involving nano-polymers, single cell analysis and even single virus analysis have been presented.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect526"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Reviews of instrumental techniques</span></h3>
        <span>The ever-increasing popularity of laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has continued over this review period. This is because it is so versatile and can be used on virtually any sample type, both solid and liquid, with no or little sample preparation, causing minimal damage. It can also be used in standoff mode, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it can analyse dangerous or unpleasant materials, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> explosives or nuclear materials from a safe distance. It may also be used in unpleasant working conditions, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> at the production sites at foundries where extreme temperatures are found. This “in-line” or “at-line” ability has the potential to save time, effort and money and is therefore very attractive. There are still a few problems associated with it, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the difficulty in calibrating samples at different temperatures or different sample types, the analysis of uneven or rough surfaces, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, but intense research has been on-going to resolve these issues. Since the <span class="italic">popularity of LIBS has been rising over the last 10 years, it has started to attract useful review papers</span>. An example was by Pedarnig <span class="italic">et al.</span> who produced a review (with 484 references) of elemental analysis of industrial materials by in-line LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> As well as a brief introduction and theoretical overview, the review provided numerous examples of the analysis of materials including assorted alloys (ferrous, not-ferrous, scrap metal and metal melts), glass, fertilizers, foods, coals and other fuels, batteries and other electrical and electronic material (plus electronic waste materials), nuclear materials, papers, pharmaceuticals, wood and refractory materials. The review is a good perspective of the current state of the art for on-line LIBS analysis. Another example was presented by Goncalves <span class="italic">et al.</span> who reviewed the advances made in the last few years of LIBS analyses in environmental systems.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> This review contained 85 references and focussed on environmental samples, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> soils, rocks <span class="italic">etc.</span>, but there were useful sections for lubricating oils and electronic wastes. A further review, by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> containing 71 references discussed “remote LIBS applications”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> Although written in Chinese, the papers cited are often in English and could be of use to the reader.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Li <span class="italic">et al.</span> reviewed (with 149 refs) <span class="italic">artificial neural network-based chemometrics applied during LIBS analysis</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> The authors discussed the different types of artificial neural network, how they are formed, trained and evaluated, what each type can do, made a comparison with other types and gave their limitations. Since these networks are so frequently used for LIBS analyses to enable identification of different glasses, polymers, alloys <span class="italic">etc.</span>, then this review is a very helpful contribution and is a good place to start for anyone new to the area and with limited knowledge of the subject.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One other LIBS review of note is worthy of mention. This was presented (with 86 references) by Xu <span class="italic">et al.</span> and was on the subject of <span class="italic">molecular emission from LIBS</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> Topics discussed included molecules of organic origin, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> –OH, –CH, –NH, –CN and C<small><sub>2</sub></small> and molecules formed to facilitate the determination of halides, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> CaF, CaCl, SrCl, <span class="italic">etc.</span> The review covers quantification of inorganic analytes as well as identification/classification of materials <span class="italic">e.g.</span> polymers and explosives.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Techniques other than LIBS have also been reviewed. A review with 185 references by Francischini and Arruda was entitled “when a picture is worth a thousand words: molecular and elemental imaging applied to environmental analysis: a review”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> A useful table presented the advantages, disadvantages and resolution capabilities of: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), Raman, LA-ICP-MS, LIBS and synchrotron XRF. Each of these techniques was also discussed in separate sections of the review giving a brief theory and applications. The majority of the applications were of environmental origin, but also included were nanoparticles and micro-plastics.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect560"><span class="a_heading">2 Metals</span></h2>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect563"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>As usual, this has been an area of intense research activity, with much of it focussed on the use of LIBS. In previous review periods, much of the interest in LIBS was focussed on calibration improvements. This has not been the case during this review period. Instead, the application of LIBS to the targeted analysis of inclusions and other applications such as underwater analysis, on-line analysis, <span class="italic">etc.</span> have become more popular. This section will describe these new LIBS applications as well as new areas of analysis using established techniques such as ICP-OES, ICPO-MS and AAS.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting overview of the <span class="italic">determination of Si in stainless steels</span> using ICP-OES was presented by Franciscono and Rollet.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> Since the samples need extremely harsh acidic conditions for dissolution, the Si may polymerise or form aggregates. Both of these species may not pass through the nebuliser/spray chamber assembly in a representative way, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> they may be discriminated against, hence yielding an apparent lower concentration than expected. This study investigated the experimental requirements necessary to prevent this from happening. Samples of several reference materials were dissolved using hydrochloric acid of varying concentration (12 M, 9 M or 6 M) with the addition of a few drops of hydrogen peroxide. Other parameters tested were the effects of filtration, dilution and aging of the digest. Higher concentrations of Si and higher concentrations of hydrochloric acid exacerbated the problems. The particles slowly dissolved with time, but too slowly to be useful analytically. It was concluded that the best dissolution procedure for each sample type should be elucidated rather than simply using a compromise.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers have discussed the <span class="italic">effects of sample temperature on the LIBS analyses</span> of steels.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14,15</span></sup></a> In the paper by Lin <span class="italic">et al.</span> the spectral intensity of both ions and atoms were reported to increase with increasing temperature.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> However, the temperature of the plasma formed hardly changed (14<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>709 K and 14<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>227 K at 1432 °C (the melting point of the steel) and at 20 °C, respectively). It was noted that both the correlation coefficients and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for C (193.03 nm), Cr (205.56 nm), Mn (293.31 nm) and Si (288.16 nm) improved at 1432 °C compared with those at 20 °C. Although the correlation coefficients were better, the improvement was only marginal, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> from 0.9577 to 0.9832 for the Cr. However, the RMSEP improvement was significant for all four analytes, with the value for Cr improving from 1.24% to 0.27%. It was concluded that controlling the temperature of the smelting process aids the stability of the LIBS analysis. The other paper, by Chang <span class="italic">et al.</span>, described how the accuracy of the analysis decreases if the temperature of the sample is different to that at which the calibration model was produced.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> Inevitably, it is impractical to produce a calibration for every temperature. Instead, these authors used Functioning Data Analysis (FDA) to produce a non-linear trend line using a calibration prepared at 20 °C as the input and elemental concentration as the output of a least squares support vector machine (SVM). This is a mathematical algorithm that is a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outlier detection. The model was built using nine reference material samples, of which five were used at room temperature to make the calibration model and at six elevated temperatures to construct the conversion model. The other four samples were used at three elevated temperatures and acted as “test” samples. Using these models, the spectra obtained at any temperature may easily be converted into the equivalent mapping at room temperature and hence input to the conversion model to obtain accurate concentration data. Using the methodology the relative error typically improved by an order of magnitude compared with data obtained when not using the models.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another paper discussed <span class="italic">how LIBS data can be affected severely when the sample surface is uneven</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> These authors described how Bessel beams may be used to overcome the problem. Bessel beams are non-diffracting beams that have the advantage of extended linear focus, hence the laser beam has uniform fluence distribution. The authors discussed how a Bessel beam is produced from a Guassian beam and described the experimental setup. An alloyed steel tube and slanting steel pieces were used as samples. A total of 50 shots in different places on the samples were made which, on the curved surface of the 22 mm diameter tube, represented a change in measurement distance of 3 mm. The accuracy and stability of the measurements were determined through the correlation coefficient, the root mean square errors of cross validation (RMSECV) and the average RSD. The data obtained using the Bessel beams were significantly improved over those obtained using Guassian beams, with the average RSD for Mn improving from 24.78% to 10.12%. Similarly, the <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values improved from 0.933 to 0.956.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several papers have continued to discuss <span class="italic">ways of improving accuracy of LIBS analyses through the use of multivariate regression methods or other statistical means</span>. Unfortunately, fiber-optic LIBS suffers from increased spectral interferences, matrix effects and self-absorption effects because the laser fluence is limited by optical fiber loss and attenuation. Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span> attempted to overcome these problems by comparing two linear models: Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS) as well as the non-linear model Support Vector Machine (SVM) during the fiber-optic-LIBS analysis of pig iron.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> Of the three models tested, the SVM provided the best results, with coefficients of determination for the predicted concentration against the certified concentration for Cr, Mn, Ni and Ti being 0.9849, 0.9705, 0.9882 and 0.9837, respectively. The respective root mean squared errors of prediction were 0.0185%, 0.0982%, 0.0179% and 0.0178%. The conclusion was that SVM offers significant advantages in terms of accuracy when using fiber-optic LIBS. Another example was described by Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span> who took a different approach.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> These authors stated that errors can be caused by noise, weak signals, self-absorption, matrix effects and the instability of the shot-to-shot signals. They used spectral pre-processing in the form of empirical mode decomposition to correct for the noise component, hence facilitating the analysis when weak signals are obtained. The empirical mode decomposition is a data-adaptive multi-resolution technique to decompose a signal into physically meaningful components. It can be used to analyse non-linear and non-stationary signals by separating them into components at different resolutions and reduces noise by refining the wavelet-scaling coefficients. The overall effect is that baseline signals are smooth and convergent. Its performance was favourable when compared with other de-noising methods. The method was applied to the determination of Cr in austenitic stainless steels, resulting in improved correlation coefficients of calibration, reduced root mean square error values and the average relative error of the predicted Cr concentration decreased from 10.46% to 3.858%. It was again concluded that the methodology could be routinely used to improve the accuracy of LIBS analyses.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">According to Deng <span class="italic">et al.</span> the accuracy of <span class="italic">single sample calibration LIBS can be severely undermined by self-absorption effects</span> which destroy the linear relationship between signal intensity and concentration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> They therefore developed a method of self-absorption correction. This was achieved by collecting spectra from the test and calibration samples under the same experimental conditions and then selecting one spectral line for each element or oxide. The shapes of the selected lines as well as the H<small><sub>α</sub></small> line were then extracted for curve fitting through the Lorentz function, enabling the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each line to be calculated. The relative self-absorption coefficient, <span class="italic">K</span>, may then be calculated and applied for the correction. A comparison of single sample calibration with and without this self-absorption correction was made during the analysis of alloy and iron ore samples. Using the self-absorption correction methodology for the alloys, the RMSEP decreased from 0.83% to 0.40% and the average relative error decreased from 13.75% to 4.06%. The results for the pressed ore samples were less impressive, but still offered a significant improvement; with RMSEP decreasing from 4.77% to 2.34% and average relative error improving from 90.48% to 14.60%. The method was simple, had good universality and does not require information such as the Stark half-width parameter. Consequently, the authors envisage it having great use for single sample calibration LIBS.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Song <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a random forest-assisted artificial neural network model to improve the accuracy of Cr and V determinations in low alloy steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> Several Fe wavelengths covering the entire spectrum were chosen as internal standards. The standardized spectral variables were then input to the RF-ANN with the calibration samples being used to first train and then verify the algorithm. The LIBS data obtained from certified steel samples using the random forest-artificial neural network methodology were compared with those obtained using a calibration curve and were far superior. The RMSECV for Cr and V were reduced from 0.060 and 0.042 using a calibration curve to 0.021 and 0.007, representing improvements of nearly three and six-fold, respectively. Additional advantages of the random forest methodology were that it used a large amount of spectral information and it used filters to remove redundant data thereby enabling a rapid training speed for the artificial neural network.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers by the same research group have discussed the application of long-short, double pulse <span class="italic">LIBS</span> to the determination of Mn in underwater steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21,22</span></sup></a> In the first example, by Cui <span class="italic">et al.</span>, it was emphasised that underwater LIBS suffers from numerous problems including self-absorption effects, weak signal intensity and low lifetime of the signal. These could all be overcome using Fraunhofer-type lines. During this experiment, the LIBS parameters were set so that the long pulse was of 30 μs duration and at a power of 100 mJ whereas the short pulse was of 7 ns with a power of 25 mJ. There was an inter-pulse delay of 15 μs, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the short pulse was fired half way through the long pulse. Ten certified steel materials (YSBS451073-2013, YSBS37207-2015 and eight others from the 2015 series) were used as samples and these were submerged in deionised water such that the gap between them and the surface of the water was 100 mm. Measurement of the Mn was at 403.307 nm. This was used to calculate the optical density of the plasma formed. The optical density values and the certified Mn concentrations were used to construct a linear calibration curve (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.9843). Two of the certified materials were then used as test samples, with results indicating that the relative error of prediction was better than 10%. Overall, it was concluded that the use of Fraunhofer lines would be of great benefit to underwater LIBS measurements. The other paper by that group compared the long-short double pulse version of LIBS with conventional single pulse LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> The long-short double pulse version gave a better stability and this was attributed to the long pulse causing a cavitation bubble without a plasma and then the short pulse creating a plasma within the bubble. The LIBS parameters of intra-pulse delay time, long pulse width and delay time were optimised. Results indicated that plasma stability and spectral signal intensity were greatly improved using a long pulse width of 80 μs and an intra-pulse delay time of 70 μs. A linear calibration (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.9842) was obtained when measuring five steel samples with differing Mn content.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several papers have used LIBS for the <span class="italic">rapid classification of scrap metal samples</span>, enabling their efficient re-cycling. Among these papers was one by Brooks and Gaustad who discussed the use and reliability of handheld XRF and handheld LIBS analysers in a scrapyard setting.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> They noted that prior to the advent of these instruments, experts had to rely on years of experience and tools such as magnets, files, grinding wheels and acids to distinguish between different metals. These handheld instruments make the classification easier and enable non-experts to make the classification. The authors did note that the best results were obtained on flat, clean samples and that real life samples of irregular shape were not classified as successfully. However, the results were encouraging and on-going work should improve classification further. It should be noted though that plated or materials could still be mis-classified. In another paper, Yuan <span class="italic">et al.</span> input the data obtained from 51 pre-selected wavelengths using fiber-optic LIBS into principal component analysis (PCA) combined with SVM to produce a model capable of distinguishing between 14 types of steel.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> The classification success of the PCA-SVM model increased with an increase in the number of principal components, reaching 100% success after 13. Using SVM only, a maximum classification success rate of 95% was achieved. The combined PCA-SVM model therefore enabled a rapid classification method using portable instrumentation that could be applied in real time at scrap centres. Data from LIBS together with a decision tree-based algorithm was developed and its use in the circular economy (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> zero waste) discussed by Moros <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> This machine learning methodology enabled the classification of 10 different classes of materials (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> alumina, silica and magnesium oxide-based materials) through the emission intensities and emission intensity ratios of analytes such as Al, C (through CN–), Mg, Si and Zr. After “training” of the model using known samples, it was applied to real samples. Although correct classification was achieved in only 75% of samples, it was noted that with pre-cleaning and other sample treatments, the classification success rate could be higher. The authors were pleased with these initial results and considered that the methodology could be useful for the iron and steel industry, which are the main users of refractory materials.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The analysis of <span class="italic">inclusions (the number, size, distribution and composition) in iron and steels</span> is vital in ensuring the materials are fit for purpose. A paper by Imashuku and Wagatsuma reviewed (with 66 refs) three emission spectrometric techniques, namely cathodoluminescence, X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) and LIBS that have been used for such an analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> The review provides a convenient table summarising the abilities of each of the techniques along with their attributes and drawbacks and then gives individual sections on each technique. It was concluded that LIBS offers the best opportunity for on-line analysis because it does not require a vacuum or any sample pretreatment. The lateral resolution of cathodoluminescence is superior to that of LIBS and also provides information of the chemical species present. The XEOL provides similar information to cathodoluminescence but, like LIBS, also operates under ambient conditions. The review would certainly be of interest to somebody working in the area. Inclusions are usually small (often &lt;50 μm) and so analysing them needs tools that are capable high spatial resolution, ensuring that the surrounding matrix does not confound the results. Laser-based techniques are capable of the task, but care must be taken to ensure that the resulting crater is not too large. A paper by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the use of microchip-LIBS to undertake the analysis of inclusion size in ductile iron and hence determine the grade of the material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> A microchip laser operating at 1064 nm, with an energy of 80 μJ and a pulse width of 550 ps was used to create craters of 10 μm diameter over a 1 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> area of sample. The optical system was described in full, with detection using a CCD. Sample was placed on a stage which was moved at a rate of 50 μm s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the laser operated at a frequency of 10 Hz, enabling the craters to overlap. When the laser hit an inclusion the spectrum obtained was significantly different from the surrounding iron matrix because both Mg and Ti were observed at 285.2 nm and 334.9 nm, respectively. Since the craters overlapped, it was therefore possible to determine the size of the spherical inclusions. Results obtained using LIBS were comparable to those obtained using conventional scanning under a metallographic microscope. Although deemed successful, the methodology was slow; taking 67 minutes to cover an area of 1 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small>. Work is on-going to try and improve the speed of analysis so that it may routinely be used in the workplace.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One of the advantages of LIBS is that it may be used remotely or in a standoff fashion. This means that it may be used in areas where working conditions may be unpleasant or dangerous. A paper by Li and Guan discussed <span class="italic">the real-time monitoring of laser cleaning of a commercial 444 type ferritic hot-rolled stainless steel</span> using LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> The cleaning process was undertaken using a 1064 nm laser operating at 55 kHz and a pulse duration of 24 ns. The power was varied between 20 and 90% of full power in an attempt to optimise the system. The area to be cleaned was flushed with 5 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> argon to prevent re-oxidation. Detection of light emitted was through a commercial optical spectrum analyser. The relative intensity ratio of the Fe signal at 520.9 nm and the Cr at 589.2 nm was used to estimate the extent of cleaning. When the oxide layer had not been removed, the Cr signal far exceeded that of the Fe. However, when the oxide layer was removed, the Fe signal increased suddenly and significantly. The authors recommended that the relative intensity ratio of Fe/Cr should be kept small to prevent over-cleaning from occurring. To ensure this, the laser power had to be monitored closely. The cleaned surface was bright and very smooth – as determined using an optical micrograph.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">determination of C in steel</span> has long been of interest because it dictates the hardness and weldability. Two papers of interest have been prepared in this review period. The first, by Zehra <span class="italic">et al.</span> used vacuum UV LIBS with a line plasma rather than a conventional point plasma.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> The optical system required for this was discussed at length. The system was optimised with special care being taken to optimise the focal length between the cylindrical lens and the sample target (2.5 mm). The C was determined at 97.7 nm. A calibration curve was established by analysing six certified reference materials (CRM Fe 1/1, 11CM 5078, 108 BS XAAS, CRM 12 B 1767, IARM-206A 206A and CRM 12X 15252) containing C concentrations of between 50 and 940 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Using the optimised setup, the LOD was ∼50 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, representing an improvement by a factor of six compared with those obtained using a conventional point plasma. However, when compared with data obtained in previous studies, one of which yielded a LOD of 1.2 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, the LOD obtained in this study was less impressive. The authors explained that direct comparison with previous studies is not possible because the detection system used in this study was old and no longer operated at peak performance. The authors thought that, had a new spectrometer and collection optics been used, a far better LOD would have been obtained. A second paper also described the determination of C in steels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> This paper described the employment of a genetic algorithm (an algorithm that will keep evolving until a suitable fitness level is reached) with back propagation artificial neural network and double pulse LIBS for the determination of C at 193.09 nm as well as the concomitant analytes Cr, Fe, Mn and Si. Using the ratios of C/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe and Si/Fe, the algorithm successfully managed the determination of C with better accuracy than either a traditional calibration curve or with the univariate back propagation artificial neural network alone. This was evidenced by the average relative error of prediction being 8.29% compared with over 14% for the other two methods.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers have reported the <span class="italic">analysis of the interface region between steel and aluminium</span>. This is important because it is necessary to determine if there is any diffusion of metals between layers. The first paper, by Holub <span class="italic">et al.</span>, used LIBS for the task.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> Two halves of a cylinder were connected with one half being the aluminium and the other steel. No glue or other form of fusing was used. The whole cylinder was sealed together by silica on the outer boundary. A LIBS instrument then took spectra across the join and the Fe/Al ratio determined. The data were then fed into PCA, self-organizing maps and standard data metrics. For the PCA analysis, the data treated using Euclidian and Manhattan treatments were compared with the expected ratio. Both treatments were in good agreement with expected values, with the Euclidian treatment perhaps being marginally better. The first principal component could easily distinguish between the aluminium and steel layers. The data obtained from the self-organizing maps software was also very encouraging. Future work was to be focussed on a bigger variety of samples as well as applying the procedure developed to heterogeneous samples. The other paper to examine the boundary between aluminium and steel was presented by Paudel <span class="italic">et al.</span>, who used slow flow direct current glow discharge-mass spectrometry (GD-MS).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> The “slow flow” refers to the discharge gas flow rate and is sometimes used as a description of several instrument types. The instrument used determined Cr and Ni across the layers. These analytes originated in the steel and could, potentially diffuse into the aluminium layer. A heat-treated (at 400 °C for 30 min) and non-heat-treated sample were analysed and the results compared. Both analytes were shown to be enriched at the interface, especially in the heat-treated sample. This phenomenon was studied further using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS). The Cr had a particularly high concentration in the aluminium layer. It was concluded that the experiment had increased our knowledge of the mechanisms that govern the growth and formation of intermetallic phases and could therefore help in the optimisation of the manufacturing process of the joints.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Kuptsov <span class="italic">et al.</span> have continued their work <span class="italic">using a two-jet arc plasma</span>, this time extending its use to both spark sampling of solid materials and calibration using solutions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> Minimal changes to operating conditions were required, although a slight adjustment to the injection gas flow was necessary to prevent the liquid calibrants from condensing and flowing away from the analyser. Once the conditions had been optimised, coefficients of relative sensitivity factors were used to construct calibration curves. These were calculated using the spectral lines of analytes and an internal standard which was a matrix element (iron in the case of steel samples and copper in the case of copper samples). Analysis of three certified steel materials for the analytes Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni and Si yielded results that, in general, were in good agreement with certified values with most results differing by no more than 15%. The worst result was achieved for Si in the material GSO 130-3, where the result of 0.18 ± 0.01% did not compare favourably with the certified value of 0.145%. Despite this anomaly, the authors concluded that the technique provided results with good accuracy and reproducibility.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper by Aboura and Moore discussed the <span class="italic">nano-SIMS analysis of the 300 series austenitic stainless steels</span> and of precipitation hardened nickel-based alloys for H and D content.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> The analysis is well known to be challenging and the paper records many artefacts that can confound the results, with many of these artefacts not having been recorded previously. Confounding artefacts include: D outgassing during analysis and D contamination in the analysis chamber. Methods attempted for the mitigation of the effects include: changing beam current, changing raster size, the use of an energy slit, <span class="italic">etc.</span> The conclusions are too lengthy to list here, but are presented in the paper along with recommendations for best practice.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Aidene <span class="italic">et al.</span> asked the intriguing question “Does chemometrics work for matrix effects correction in X-ray fluorescence analysis”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> These authors used EDXRF to analyse two sets of samples: 46 carbon and alloy steel reference materials and 68 samples of iron, manganese, chromium and other ores, of which 41 were reference materials. Once analytical data had been acquired, they were processed in numerous ways with a comparison made between the conventional ways (ordinary least squares, fundamental parameters and intensity correction) and chemometric algorithms (partial least squares, K nearest neighbour (KNN) regression and ANN). The efficiency of the assorted models were evaluated by calculating the root mean squared error of calibration and validation as well as <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> (Pearson’s correlation coefficient for the measured <span class="italic">vs.</span> predicted plots in calibration and validation). Since the large number of samples had very broad concentration ranges, significant matrix effects were observed, meaning that ordinary least squares treatment was incapable of making adequate corrections. A little surprisingly, the best performing treatment was that of conventional intensity correction. The authors did point out that the chemometric methods also offered satisfactory precision (but inferior to the intensity correction), but the accuracy obtained was very dependent on sample type/interferences present. For instance, the partial least squares method was adequate for compensating for simple line overlap, but could not compensate for non-linear matrix effects. Instead, the non-linear algorithms of KNN and ANN were superior for this purpose. However, they suffered the drawback of needing significant numbers of samples to train the models. The paper was interesting and was a timely reminder that chemometric methods are not a magic bullet and cannot compensate for everything.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally in this section are two papers that have analysed <span class="italic">steel powders used for additive manufacturing (3D printing)</span>. The paper by Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LIBS for the rapid analysis of synthetic steel powder (made by mixing varying proportions of high purity iron and manganese powders).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> Samples were analysed in three different ways: pressed pellets (already used for soils, sediments <span class="italic">etc.</span>), adsorption band (where the sample is sprayed onto the surface of a tape containing a conductive adhesive), and loose powders. The adsorption band method uses simpler tools, is more easily automated and is more rapid than the pressed pellet methodology. The powder method was not conducive to LIBS measurements, with extremely irreproducible results being produced. The LIBS intensities for Mn (at 403.307 nm) and Fe (at 404.581 nm) were used to calculate intensity ratios. For the pressed pellets the calibration curve of intensity ratio against Mn content yielded a regression of 0.910, which was far inferior to the 0.998 obtained using the adsorption band. In addition, the error bars were significantly wider for the pressed pellet samples (&gt;20% RSD compared with ∼6% RSD for the adsorption band) and the signal intensities were a factor of 3–4 greater for the adsorption band method. The obvious conclusion was that the adsorption band methodology is the best for this type of analysis. The other paper to analyse steels used for 3D printing was by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span>, who used micro-beam XRF for the task of determining the analytes Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni and Si and then used LIBS to corroborate the data.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> Samples were prepared by mixing two types of alloy powder: SS431 and 316L stainless steel <span class="italic">via</span> a high precision, multi-channel coaxial feeding nozzle and a laser beam focussed to melt the mixture into a cladded layer. Poly-capillary X-ray optics were used to obtain high spatial resolution with a spot size of 20 μm. Calibration was through the use of certified reference materials (2012-316L and GSB03-208-6-2006) with similar composition to the samples. The results of the μ-XRF and LIBS were in good agreement, but the μ-XRF method had the advantage of better resolution and, hence, could give more information regarding the elemental distribution. Analysis of these materials is important because when the proportions of the two starting powders are altered during the preparation to form a gradient stainless steel, cracks appeared in the martensite–austenite transformation region when the Ni content reached between 6.5 and 8.5%.</p>

A paper by Yamani <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the preparation and certification of three new aluminium alloy reference materials (NIS-CRM067 to NIS-CRM069).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> During preparation, the samples were cast into bars with a diameter of 40 mm and then sliced into pieces 30 mm in length. The ends of the samples were then polished smooth. Once prepared by the Egyptian National Institute of Standards, the materials were sent to several independent laboratories for analysis. The methods of sample preparation and analysis varied between laboratories, with a microwave dissolution method and a wet preparation method being used along with different analytical techniques such as XRF, ICP-OES, AAS and AES. The paper then went through the statistical processing and certification of the materials. Another paper describing the preparation of standards was presented by Martinuzzi <span class="italic">et al.</span> who developed a robust and cost-effective protocol to fabricate calibration standards for the thickness determination of metal coatings using XRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> As the authors pointed out, XRF is the most commonly used technique for this because it is non-destructive, robust and easy to use. The primary standards are expensive, may not be readily available and have a limited shelf-life. The method developed involved the electroplating of Ni onto brass plates (10 cm × 7.5 cm × 0.25 mm) for four discrete times ranging between 2 and 26 minutes. The thickness of the coating was then measured by cutting the plate in half and analysing it using light microscopy and SEM. The coatings for the four different plating times were 1.2, 3.9, 7.8 and 15.6 μm thick, representing a plating rate of 0.6 μm min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> under the conditions specified. Each plating was undertaken in triplicate so that an estimate of reproducibility could be made. Precision was better than 5%. The materials were then used for the determination thickness of coating in certified standards. The results were in very good agreement with certified values when the in-house standards were used for calibration and were significantly better than the data produced when no standardisation was used.</span>

          <span>The analysis of copper and copper-based alloys <span class="italic">e.g.</span> brass and bronze has, as usual, attracted significant research attention. Much of the more interesting work has employed LIBS, but other techniques are also popular. One example, by Kuptsov <span class="italic">et al.</span> used a <span class="italic">two-jet arc plasma with spark sampling and calibration using solutions</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> Both steel and copper samples were analysed, so this paper was discussed in Section 2.1. The reader is referred there for more detail.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">As mentioned previously, many of the papers used LIBS for the analysis and some of these are still reporting methods to try and <span class="italic">improve the accuracy of the analysis</span>. An example was presented by Xu <span class="italic">et al.</span> who optimized a combined atomic and ionic line algorithm to give high spectral stability and quantitative accuracy during the LIBS analysis of bronze and soil samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> The theory of the algorithm was presented in the paper and then it was applied as a simulation first and then to the determination of Fe and Mn in the samples. For the analysis of the bronze sample, the algorithm improved the RSD obtained from 7–15% when using atomic and ionic lines individually to 5–8% for when they were combined. In addition, a small improvement in the <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> of the calibration curves was also achieved, with values improving from 0.982 and 0.992 to 0.991 and 0.996 for Mn and Fe, respectively. The root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) values also demonstrated a minor improvement. Similar improvements were also observed for the soil samples leading the authors to conclude that the algorithm could help commercialization of LIBS. In a paper packed with theory and mathematics, Deng <span class="italic">et al.</span> attempted to improve the accuracy of single sample calibration LIBS using self-absorption correction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> Unfortunately, self-absorption effects are known to destroy the linearity of calibration graphs in LIBS, so relying on only one calibrant can lead to serious error. These authors therefore corrected for this using a method that did not rely on complicated preparatory information. Instead, they used intensity ratios of spectral lines of differing sensitivity to determine the extent of self-absorption, producing a self-absorption coefficient (<span class="italic">K</span>). They tested the methodology during the analysis of aluminium bronze and pressed ore samples. Compared with standard single sample calibration LIBS, the modified version provided greatly improved results with the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and average relative error (ARE) decreasing from 0.83 wt% and 13.75% to 0.4 wt% and 4.08% for the aluminium-bronze samples. Results of the pressed ore samples were even more impressive, with RMSEP and ARE decreasing from 4.77 wt% and 90.48% to 2.34 wt% and 14.60% when the self-absorption was corrected for. The large improvement led the authors to conclude that this was a big step forward in the use of single sample calibration-LIBS. A paper by Ahmed <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the use of calibration-free LIBS for the analysis of iron–copper alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> The authors first calculated the plasma temperature using select lines of Cu and Fe (ensuring that the lines chosen were not subject to self-absorption or poor sensitivity) and then used a Boltzmann plot for the calculation. These yielded results of 8400 K ± 1000 using the Cu(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) lines and 8700 K ± 1000 using the Fe(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) lines. They then calculated the electron number density using the Stark broadened line profile, obtaining a result of 2.2 × 10<small><sup>16</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. These values could then be applied to help calculate the concentrations of analytes found in the sample, yielding results of 23.85 ± 5% for Fe and 76 ± 5% for Cu. The methodology was validated through the analysis of the same sample using ICP-MS. No details were given, but presumably, some sort of an acid dissolution was required prior to this analysis. The results of the ICP-MS analysis were in excellent agreement with those obtained using LIBS, leading the authors to conclude that the simple, rapid and reliable LIBS method could be used to obtain accurate data.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An interesting LIBS application by Myakalwar <span class="italic">et al.</span> used <span class="italic">LIBS to monitor the molten phase desulfurization process of blister copper</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> The on-line or standoff use of LIBS is one of its main advantages over many other techniques because it does not require the analyst to get close to hazardous or unpleasant environments. The desulfurization process occurs when oxygen is passed through the molten sample (at 1270 °C) and the S removed as SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The paper described the LIBS setup in detail, giving schematics to aid comprehension. A high energy laser pulse (270 mJ) at 10 Hz was used for the excitation and the Cu, O and S emissions at 351.06 nm (picked to avoid self-absorption), 777.34 nm and 921.29 nm, respectively were used for the analysis of both molten and gaseous phases. Once the data had been obtained, they underwent chemometric analysis (hierarchical cluster analysis) and the best 50 spectra out of 200 taken per time point were averaged, giving a mean spectrum. In this way, the LIBS was capable of determining the exact point that all of the S had been removed and so the desulfurization process could be stopped before oxidation of the copper occurred. The efficiency of the desulfurization process could therefore be optimized because of the LIBS measurements, saving time and expense.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The matter of <span class="italic">“crosstalk” and its measurement using LIBS</span> was discussed by Meinhardt <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> Crosstalk is the interaction between a surface layer, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> an oxide layer and the substrate below when a laser is attempting to remove it. The paper discussed how this interaction may occur and gave three possibilities. These were: (1) direct interaction between the laser beam and surface layer, (2) indirect interaction between the expanding plasma originating from the substrate and the surface layer at the crater walls and recasting layers being present after the ablation step and (3) contaminating the substrate material underneath surface layer. The authors set up a study in which a brass substrate had a layer of stainless steel of thickness 500 μm placed on top. In most cases, this was glued, but for a few experiments it was clamped. The LIBS data indicated that the latter two methods had the greatest effect on the LIBS measurements. However, these effects could be minimized by utilizing a two-stage ablation sequence in which a circular trench is first ablated in the surface layer (to approximately its entire depth) and then a second laser pulse aimed at the centre of the trench is used for the LIBS measurement.</p>

The atomic lines of O at 130 nm and at 777 nm were used for the determination with the conditions used for the DC discharge being 700 V, 20 mA and with a 4 mm anode. The detection system comprised a 750 mm Rowland circle with photomultiplier tubes or a 400 mm Rowland circle with a CCD. The emission yield of O at 130 nm was heavily dependent on the matrix. The line shift effect was also significant at this wavelength. However, these problems were not the case for the 777 nm line, where the same emission yield was obtained for all the matrices and line shift did not occur. In addition, for both detection systems, the signal at 777 nm was greater than at 130 nm. An FeO layer was then prepared and characterized using Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS), XRD and GD-OES. The results obtained for this using the method developed were not so good because it showed an enhanced emission yield at 777 nm (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> it deviated from the matrix independent calibration), although it was similar to the emission yield of the Al at 130 nm. These initial results were still encouraging though. Future work is to include the analysis of more samples, the use of other O wavelengths (although the one at 844.636 nm is beyond the sensitive region of the monochromator/PMT assembly), calibration at a constant pressure along with changing the impedance.

Several calibration strategies were attempted for both techniques with validation being achieved with reference materials other than those used for calibration. For both techniques, all except one of the calibration strategies provided data that were in excellent agreement with certified values. The exception was the matrix cross type calibration that provided marginally worse data. When matrix matched calibrants were used and for a S concentration range of 25–1300 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> the GD-MS analysis provided significantly better relative expanded uncertainty values (3 to 7%) compared with LA-ICP-MS (11 to 33%).

          <p class="otherpara">A new <span class="italic">technique entitled X-ray and Particle Induced Fluorescence (XPIF) spectrometry</span>, which is a combination of laser-based XRF and PIXE was described by Boivin <span class="italic">et al.</span> who then applied it to the analysis of brass, bronze and stainless steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48</span></sup></a> The methodology was described extensively in the paper. Briefly, an extremely intense laser source (multi-hundred TW laser system) interacted with the solid sample, accelerated protons and produced X-rays characteristic of the elements that were present in the sample. These intensities were input to an iterative MATLAB algorithm that enabled calculation of X-ray yields <span class="italic">etc.</span> It automatically generated a characteristic emission X-ray spectrum from the image of photons hits on a CCD X-ray camera, detected and assigned the Kα and Kβ peaks with elements and computed the integrated yield from the peaks. Through an iterative process, they then found the mass ratios which optimized the fit between the experimental yields and the simulated yields. As a validation step, they tested three homogeneous metallic multi-element samples using XPIF and a reference commercial EDX spectrometer. The X-ray yield from each of the characteristic wavelengths was then related to the mass fraction of that element in the sample. The instrument was capable of switching from laser driven PIXE to laser-driven XRF or even using both simultaneously. Results obtained using XPIF from the samples were compared with those obtained using a conventional EDXRF analysis and were within the error bars. The new technique has two main advantages over existing methods: no previous knowledge of the sample composition is required and it has a higher yield than laser-driven PIXE without X-rays. On-going work will look to increase the repetition rate so that smaller fluctuations occur which, hopefully, will result in a reduction of uncertainties and an increase in accuracy.</p>

          <span id="sect739"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.2.4 Aluminium and aluminium-based alloys. </span>
          <span>In common with the analysis of other metal types, LIBS has been the analytical method of choice by many workers for the analysis of aluminium and its alloys with <span class="italic">attempts to improve accuracy</span> being a popular area of study. This is exemplified in a paper by Dai <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used LIBS combined with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select the spectral features followed by Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) for regression.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> This enabled a multivariate quantitative analysis model to be established for the analytes Cu, Fe, Mg and Ni. The performance of the model was compared with a more traditional univariate linear calibration and partial least squares regression. The LIBS–LASSO–LSSVM proved to be superior, yielding <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of better than 0.99 for all analytes, improved RMSEC and RMSEP values and average relative errors of 5.76, 3.20, 3.49 and 5.49% for Cu, Fe, Mg and Ni, respectively. The better performance was attributed to the LASSO–LSSVM being able to eliminate errors arising from self-absorption and noise originating from the emission source. The LASSO had the added advantage of reducing the risk of over-fitting the data because it identifies the main spectral features. It was concluded that the combination of methods is a rapid, accurate and feasible way of analysing alloys. Another paper by the same research group improved the accuracy of the Fe determination in aluminium alloy using millisecond LIBS under spatial confinement followed by SVM to aid regression.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> Spatial confinement apparently leads to spectral enhancement of the ms-LIBS by a factor of 2–2.5, depending on the Fe wavelength used. Using the LIBS system under confinement and the SVM significantly improved accuracy and repeatability (in terms of RMSEC, RMSEP, <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> and ARE). This was achieved through a concomitant decrease in matrix effects.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Shabbir <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported <span class="italic">methodology to account for the errors experienced during the LIBS analysis of irregular shaped sample surfaces</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a> Unfortunately, such errors are common and can seriously affect the analysis of, for example, scrap metal. Consequently, the authors developed a method that used 20 reference materials. The samples were cut and then a saw was used on one half of the cut surface, roughening it with 1 mm trenches, mimicking irregular-shaped scrap metal. The other half of the surface was smooth. Then LIBS analysis was undertaken on both halves using the same conditions before the emission intensities were treated with a complex series of chemometric packages. The first step was a univariate regression, then multivariate regression with machine learning and finally, multivariate regression with transfer learning. The first two steps were used for training calibration models with the spectra obtained with the smooth half of the sample surface. The irregular surface data were then used with the calibration models to identify and quantify physical effects (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> assess the prediction performance of the calibration models). The third part of the chemometric treatment was then used to transfer the data from the first two steps to software that could learn from any disparities arising from the irregular surface. Results were compared with those obtained using a simple internal standard and with other chemometric techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> a machine-learning -based multivariate regression, and were a significant improvement. For the analytes Fe, Mg, Si and Zn, the average relative error of calibration was 2.3% and average relative error of prediction was 16.3%.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The technique of LIBS is generally regarded as being minimally damaging to samples. However, if improved sensitivity is required, single shot LIBS must increase power and hence cause a bigger crater, increasing sample damage. Many studies have therefore used double pulse LIBS with a second laser beam fired orthogonally so as not to cause further sample damage. A new method entitled “<span class="italic">target enhanced orthogonal double pulse LIBS using a dielectric target</span> was reported by Jiang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> In this study, the second laser fired orthogonally was aimed at a target compound (in this case potassium hydrogen carbonate) and the plasma produced from this excited the plume of material from the sample caused by the first laser beam. Potassium hydrogen carbonate was chosen as the dielectric target so as not to cause interfering wavelengths from a metallic target. The setup was applied to the determination of Al, Cr, Cu, Mn and Si in aluminium alloy and led to an increase in sensitivity by a factor of between eight and 15 (depending on the analyte and the energy of the second laser) when compared with conventional orthogonal double pulse LIBS. The method seemed ideal for causing minimal damage whilst improving sensitivity of the analysis.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Xu <span class="italic">et al.</span> used a fibre-laser-based LIBS instrument to determine Cu, Mg and Mn in aluminium alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> A fibre laser is a fibre optic doped with a rare earth element that acts as the gain element for the laser. The laser had a high repetition rate and a low pulse energy. The laser spot overlap, non-overlapping ablation area, scan speed and single pulse energy were studied in detail. A linear function between the intensity and the non-overlapping ablation area was observed. The function between the spectral intensity, single point pulse number and scan speed was also demonstrated. After complete optimization, the performance of the system was evaluated. The <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values for all three analytes were &gt;0.998, the average RSD was better than 5% and the RMSECV values were 0.0103 wt%, 0.0384 wt% and 0.0295 wt% for Cu, Mg and Mn, respectively.

This was an encouraging sign since it indicated that the LIBS was capable of measuring the Ti concentration in the molten material accurately. The LIBS measurements also demonstrated that the Al<small><sub>3</sub></small>Ti phase forms and dissolves in only a few minutes when the melt temperature is decreased or increased.

The XRF analysis of the resulting coupons found that the coatings were of uneven thickness, especially for the brushed samples. The accuracy of the thickness measurement was calculated by means of a semi-empirical approach and the results indicated that thickness could be estimated with an uncertainty of ±5%.

Once optimized, the system was applied to the determination of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Rb, Sr, V and Zn in bioethanol samples (diluted 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 with water) and alcoholic beverages. The authors noted that during the optimization, it was necessary to minimize interferences rather than optimize sample signal. Spiking experiments yielded recoveries of between 80 and 115% without the necessity of using an internal standard. It was hypothesised that had an internal standard been used, recovery may have improved further.</p>

Since the analytes were introduced to a “dry” plasma (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> no H other than that originating in the target compounds was present), it was assumed that the formation of H<small><sup>12</sup></small>C would be minimal. The entrance valve to the MS had to remain shut for four minutes after injection to ensure that the C originating in the solvent (dichloromethane) did not overload the Faraday cup detectors. Once the solvent front had safely passed, the valve was opened to allow the analytes in the organic samples to be determined. Precision over the concentration range 0.2–0.6 nM C was 0.3 or 0.4‰, degrading to 1‰ at lower concentration. The method was validated through comparison with data obtained using GC-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS). Results were in good agreement, although the precision for the GC-MC-ICP-MS was poorer. Nevertheless, it was concluded that the method was capable of obtaining accurate and precise data and could be an alternative to the conventional GC-IRMS.</p>

          <span>The analysis of impurities in pharmaceutical materials is an expanding topic area. According to Pinheiro and Nobrega, this is because of a revision of the United States pharmacopoeia that now includes chapters describing sample preparation and two analytical techniques; namely ICP-OES and ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> This <span class="italic">overview paper</span> contains 99 references and summarises the sample preparation methods used for the determination of elemental impurities in medicines. The review is conveniently split into sections that include: dilution in aqueous or organic medium, extraction techniques, microwave-induced combustion and wet digestion methods (including microwave-assisted methods). Tables are used to good effect and summarise the data nicely. The review is a good starting point for anyone new to the area and is a good source of reference for more experienced workers.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper entitled “<span class="italic">Tutorial and spreadsheet for the evaluation of instrumental quantification uncertainty by the linear weighted regression model</span>: determination of elemental impurities in nasal spray by ICP-MS” was presented by Pluhacek <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> There is nothing terribly novel about the chemistry in this paper, with samples simply being diluted and acidified prior to analysis. Method validation was through spike/recovery experiments for the analytes As, Cd, Co, Hg, Ni, Pb and V. Despite the lack of novelty in the actual analysis stage, the tutorial is a worthwhile contribution because it is a good example of how to determine uncertainty and is therefore useful from the metrics perspective.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The development of a <span class="italic">LA dielectric barrier discharge -optical emission spectrometric method for the direct determination of Cl and S in pharmaceutical samples</span> was reported by Ding <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77</span></sup></a> A continuous wave IR laser operating at 808 nm was used to volatilize the analytes from the condensed surface and then a dielectric barrier discharge operating using an alternating voltage of 10 kV and at a frequency of 25 kHz was used to excite the analytes further. The Cl and S were measured in commercial tablets of the drugs sulfadiazine and chloramphenicol. The dynamic range extended between 0.5 and 20%, <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> was only 0.93 and LOD were reported to be at the mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range. Although the linearity was not great, the sensitivity was sufficient for the analysis. The method was quick, the results of the commercial tablets were in agreement with expected values and the method could be used on-line because minimal sample preparation was necessary.

          <p class="otherpara">Two papers by Pinheiro <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) of analytes in pharmaceutical samples prior to ICP-OES analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78,79</span></sup></a> In the first example, the DLLME process involved extracting the analytes (Cd, Co, Hg, Ni, Pb and V) from the 10-fold diluted drugs into a deep eutectic solvent formed by mixing <span class="small_caps">DL</span>-menthol (2 M) with decanoic acid (1 M) at 60 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> The extraction procedure was optimized using Plackett–Burman design to identify significant factors followed by a central composite design to determine the optimal values for those factors that were significant. In this paper, there were seven parameters to be optimized. These were (with their respective minima and maxima): deep eutectic solvent volume (50 and 100 mL); sample pH (2 and 4); 8-hydroxyquinoline concentration (0.50 and 1.0% m/v); extraction time (1 and 3 min); centrifugation time (2 and 4 min); centrifuge speed (2000 and 3000 rpm) and ionic strength, NaCl concentration (0 and 5% m/v). Unfortunately, each analyte had a different set of optimal conditions. Therefore, a compromise set were used. These conditions were: sample pH of 3.4, 8-HQ concentration of 1.0% m/v, 70 mL of DES as extractant solvent, vortex time of 3 min, centrifugation time of 4 min and centrifugation speed of 3000 rpm. Since 8 mL of the 10-fold diluted drug was treated and the extraction volume of deep eutectic solvent was 70 μL, large preconcentration factors resulted (between 22 and 86, depending on the analyte). Linearity of standards was at least 0.9982 for all analytes. Spike/recovery experiments were undertaken with recoveries of between 90 and 109% being obtained. Precision was also acceptable with RSD values of &lt;6% being obtained. The other paper was very similar in design, but fewer analytes were determined, (Cd, Hg and Pb).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> Again, seven parameters were optimized and once optimized, the procedure yielded a performance very similar to the previous paper.</p>

Once the retention times of the species had been determined, a four-way valve switching system was placed between the column and the ICP-MS sample introduction system. In that way very high concentrations of carboplatin could be directed to waste, ensuring that an excessively high Pt background did not exist for the detection of low concentrations of hexachloroplatinate. The linear range for the target species was 1–100 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the LOD was 0.1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

To this end, the authors tested four different oxidation systems: (1) potassium bromide/potassium bromate; (2) potassium permanganate; (3) potassium iodide/potassium iodate and (4) sodium sulfide/potassium permanganate. Only systems (1) and (2) yielded quantitative oxidation. Spike/recovery experiments demonstrated a lack of matrix interferences, with recoveries being 80.1–106% for oxidant (1) and marginally better for oxidant (2) (92.5–101%). The system developed was then applied to the determination of thiomersal in five different vaccines with varying thiomersal concentration. Results were comparable to those obtained using a microwave assisted digestion followed by CV-AFS. The method developed was simple, rapid, reliable and accurate.</p>

Other concomitants, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ca, Cl, Cr, Cu, K, Mn, Ti, Zn and species such as phosphates, sulfates and vanadates had minimal effect. For the samples 0.25 g was dissolved using aqua regia with microwave assistance and then diluted to 25 mL. After adjusting the pH to 2, 1 mg of the composite was added to retain the Au. Since an aqua regia extract was used, the Au nanoparticles in the cosmetics were dissolved and so total Au was determined. Since 0.25 g of sample was used and the Au then extracted onto 1 mg of nanocomposite, a significant enrichment factor was obtained. Despite this, the Au in several of the samples could not be detected. This was despite the fact that the product clearly stated that Au was present. The conclusion therefore was that the method was successful for determining total Au in these products and could identify those products that were advertising the presence of Au falsely.</p>

Standard samples of citrate stabilized nanoparticles with mean diameter 10 ± 4 nm, 20 ± 4 nm, 40 ± 4 nm and 60 ± 8 nm were used to collect data for the model and a further set of standards used to test it.

This approach could provide a robust method for use in routine laboratories.</p>

          <span>Contributions for this section appear to have increased this year but unfortunately at the cost of quality. Many papers focus on various types of emulsion breaking sample preparation techniques however many are lacking analytical rigour, including detection limits and use of CRMs or samples with known concentrations for validation.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The first paper in this section, by Henn <span class="italic">et al.</span>, described a <span class="italic">microwave digestion method for the Mg, Pb and Sr isotopic analysis of crude oil</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> This method was compared with the ASTM D4807 method of decomposition.

The results suggested that their solubility and aggregation strongly correlate to a higher hydrogen deficiency and increased heteroatom levels. High temperature gas chromatography coupled with ICP-MS showed that Ni and V compounds have boiling points of at least 566 °C. Quantification of the V-content below 704 °C for the Venezuelan crude 1 indicated that the acetone fraction contained a large amount of distillable V (similar to 62% wt). These results suggest that the extrography method is useful to produce fractions enriched with asphaltene species. Understanding Ni and V concentrations in asphaltene fractions has significant commercial importance as they are potential feedstocks as a precursor of carbonised materials such as carbon fibres.</p>

          <span>Three papers and a review were of interest in this section this year. The number of papers on this subject had increased, however many were of little interest just describing standard methods for analysis for a set of collected bio-fuels and lacked analytical rigour.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A review article, by Martinez <span class="italic">et al.</span>, containing 180 references on the subject of <span class="italic">multi-elemental analysis of renewable fuel feedstock</span> has been published this year.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> The use of oils and fats, mainly from non-edible or used sources, microalgae, plastic wastes and lignocellulosic residues are increasingly used as feedstock. Quality control of these materials involves the quantification of trace elements because their presence, even at trace levels, can lead to environmental concerns and may impact the performance of combustion engines. In order to circumvent these problems, accurate and sensitive analytical techniques are required to control the level of these elements. This paper reviews the different analytical tools used to undertake this type of analysis.

However, the presence of P-containing compounds, mainly from phospholipids, in these feedstocks is known to poison and deactivate hydrotreating catalysts during fuel production. In this work, GPC-ICP-HR-MS was used to analyse feedstocks including unprocessed soybean oil, animal fat and pyrolysis oils from red oak and milorganite to identify P species. The results showed the presence of a wide range of different P compounds. Analyses of a vegetable oil and two animal fats show different fingerprints based on the molecular weight of each of the samples, highlighting the structural differences among their corresponding P-containing compounds. While the presence of low-molecular-weight species, such as phospholipids, was expected, several high-molecular-weight species (MW &gt; 10<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 Da) were found, suggesting that high-molecular-weight micelles or liposomes might have been formed due to the high concentration of phospholipids in these samples.</p>

Section headings include: instruments, analysis methods (including ratio methods for C/H <span class="italic">etc.</span>, statistical methods employed, chemometric tools employed), applications including on-line methods and a conclusions and future perspective. The biggest section is that describing the use of chemometric tools. Although the review does not discuss the theory of each of the methods, it does give examples of the packages used. These include: principal component analysis (PCA), soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA), artificial neural networks, random forest, partial least squares, support vector machines (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and several others. The review is well written and would be of interest to workers in the field.

It covers current methods of extraction (combinations of different acids under different conditions), detection and quantification of metals (the different instrumental techniques used), challenges, quality control and quality assurance. Since large discrepancies in results can occur through relatively small changes in experimental protocol, the review calls for standardized methods to be used.

These included single particle ICP-MS as well as varying forms of organic mass spectrometry, such as pyrolysis-GC-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, thermal extraction/desorption GC-MS and direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry. In its future perspective section, this review also calls for standardized methods as well as optimized methods of sample collection and extraction.

          <span id="sect1134"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.3.2 Analysis of micro- and nanoparticles. </span>
          <span>This has been a popular area of research. It is known or has long been suspected that micro- and nanoparticles of polymers in the environment can act as sinks for toxic trace elements and other organic materials. Atomic spectrometry can be used to identify the plastics, determine which metals are associated with them, determine whether or not they are released from the particles once inside an organism <span class="italic">etc.</span> As well as the reviews described in the previous section, numerous applications have been described and these will be discussed below. It is important to differentiate between engineered nanomaterials discussed in Section 4.9 and those micro- and nanoparticles of plastic that have been formed by weathering or degradation of larger plastic bodies. It is the latter that are discussed in this section.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A method for the counting of nanoplastic particles in environmental waters was reported by Lai <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used single nanoparticle (sNP) ICP-MS technology that has been developed over the last few years.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> The method involved the destruction of natural inorganic nanoparticles using nitric and hydrofluoric acids at pH 2, cloud point extraction of the nano-polymers using Triton X45 and some sodium chloride solution (not required for seawater samples), labelling of the polymer materials with Au, sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate the labelled polymers from Au nanoparticles and then detection using SP-ICP-MS. The procedure was optimized ensuring that the Au was attached to numerous polymer types (polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polyvinyl chloride and polymethylmethacrylate). Although the method could not differentiate between different polymers, it could give an estimate of the total polymer particle number concentration and the particle size distribution. The developed method was applied to river, lake, sea and waters discharged from a wastewater treatment plant. The particle number LOD was 4.6 × 10<small><sup>8</sup></small> L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> based on 269 nm diameter spherical polystyrene nanoparticles. Spike and recovery experiments indicated recoveries between 72.9 and 92.8%, depending on the polymer type and matrix. This is a good example of where a rather theoretical and “dry” subject such as nanoparticle analysis can be applied to real world problems.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">labelling of nano-plastics with metal probes so that they be measured more easily</span> has been studied by Marigliano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> Polymers usually contain C and H (and some may also contain O or N) and therefore are not readily detectable using ICP-MS. Labelling them with a metal therefore facilitates their determination. This paper discussed three strategies whereby metals are attached to the plastics: labelling with metal ions, labelling with hydrophobic organometallic compounds and labelling with metal nanoparticles. The relative merits and drawbacks of each of the strategies were discussed, with examples of each given. Labelling with ions always has the possibility that insufficient of them will attach to the polymer surface or that too many ions remain in solution making it difficult to differentiate between dissolved ions and nano-polymer-attached ions. These problems are not encountered with nanoparticles, since separating free nanoparticles from those attached to the polymer is relatively straightforward and well-documented. The authors concluded that labelling either with hydrophobic organometallic compounds or with metals nanoparticles were the most promising strategies, with Au nanoparticles perhaps being the best option of all.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several other quite exciting applications have been presented in this review period. Sommer <span class="italic">et al.</span> used <span class="italic">LIBS to identify microplastic litter</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm and with a frequency of 10 Hz and energy of 200 mJ was used for the measurements, with detection achieved using a spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD. Reference pieces of assorted polymers were used to “calibrate” the system. Measurements were made for C at 247.8 nm, for H at 486.14 nm and 656.29 nm, for N at 746.8 nm and for O at 777.3 nm. In addition, molecular bands for C<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CH, CN, OH and CO were also monitored. Analytical data were input to PCA to aid the identification. The method proved to be very successful and was capable of distinguishing between polymer microparticles and other naturally occurring particles. In addition, it was able to differentiate between different polymer types. The method was extremely rapid (∼1 s per measurement), portable, could be used for depth profiling (by analysing the same spot with successive laser firings) and offered great hope for studies held <span class="italic">in situ</span>.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another paper that reported the identification of micro-plastics was presented by Feng <span class="italic">et al.</span>, who developed a <span class="italic">rapid SIMS method to identify and spatially map the polymers in Paramecia</span> (a type of unicellular organism).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> Paramecia were exposed to six types of micro-polymers (polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyglycidyl methacrylate and polyamide) that were in the diameter range 1–50 μm and at a concentration of 50 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 24 h. The resulting paramecia were then analysed using TOF-SIMS employing a Bi<small><sup>3+</sup></small> ion primary beam at a power of 30 keV over a 300 × 300 μm<small><sup>2</sup></small> area. For 3D work, the sample was sputtered using an argon beam prior to analysis using the Bi<small><sup>3+</sup></small>. Each of the different polymers produced a different mass spectrum, enabling identification to be made, even when no sample preparation was required. Each micropolymer type produced at least two fragments that led to a positive identification – even when a mixture of polymers was present. The resolution was slightly better than 700 nm meaning that a polymethylmethacrylate microparticle of 2 μm diameter and weighing ∼4.6 pg may easily be detected. This is clearly an impressive result and the technique holds a great deal of promise for the future.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another paper with an environmental bent was prepared by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span> who developed a method of quantifying the dynamics of the UV aging process of polystyrene microplastics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> Given the enormous amount of plastic entering the environment and that this experiences degradation through UV irradiation, it is vital to see how it weathers, at what speed and what it weathers into. These authors therefore obtained polystyrene particles with a maximum diameter of 5 μm and made a 10 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> suspension with them. A 36 W UV light then irradiated the suspensions for set time periods (0, 3, 6 and 12 h). After each period, single particle ICP-MS was used monitoring the <small><sup>13</sup></small>C signal to identify the particle size distribution. The results were compared with those obtained using SEM and were in broad agreement. Both techniques identified that the average particle size reduced almost straight away. Interestingly, the particle number concentration did not alter much during the first 12 hours, indicating that secondary particles were not formed. However, secondary particles did begin to form after 12 hours, with the total particle concentration reaching a maximum after 20 hours and having almost three times the number of particles than at the start.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Teramoto and Kim described the <span class="italic">development of a temporally and spatially resolved ICP-OES instrument</span> capable of measuring the size distribution of plastics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> Suspensions of polystyrene particles of 1.5 μm and 3 μm were prepared and introduced to the instrument using a monodisperse microdroplet dispenser operating at high frequency (400 Hz). The ICP torch was inverted so that gravity could aid the stability of the sample introduction. A high speed camera operating with a double monochromator was used to detect the particles. A full description will not be given here, because it is not really an application of polymer analysis. However, it was capable of clearly separating the 1.5 and 3 μm particles and could be a powerful tool for such environmental analyses.</p>

          <span>The <span class="italic">recycling of polymers is of ever-increasing importance but classifying them is an analytical challenge</span>. Some of the coloured (or black) polymers cannot be analysed using IR and most polymers have similar components, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> C and H, with a few also having N and O. The reader is directed to Section 3.3.1 for a review by Neo <span class="italic">et al.</span> entitled “A review on chemometric techniques with infrared, Raman and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy for sorting plastic waste in the recycling industry” which is relevant to this section.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit105"><sup><span class="sup_ref">105</span></sup></a> It is known that LIBS can be used to differentiate between some polymers but often the spectra are very similar. A paper by Gajarska <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LIBS to obtain data and then treated the analytical data with a suite of chemometric tools (PCA, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Random Forest) and, in doing so, managed to differentiate between 20 different polymer types.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> The LIBS parameters of gate delay, atmosphere (argon or air) and laser energy were optimised for the determination of C, C<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Cl, CN, H, O and Si. Since such a large number of polymers were being tested, using different operating parameters and for different analytes, a huge number of variables resulted. This was simplified by forming “cluster purity” obtained using KNN. The best resolution for the 20 polymers was obtained using the shortest gate delay (0.1 μs) at the highest laser energy (3 mJ) and in an argon atmosphere. However, there was still significant overlap of some clusters. The authors therefore undertook a second optimization, this time of the spectral variables with the greatest relevance for polymer identification. When both optimizations were used, PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis could classify the 20 virgin materials which is among the greatest number reported thus far. In addition, polymers containing additives could also be identified, meaning that the method could potentially be used for real scrap samples.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The other paper in this section was presented by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used <span class="italic">LIBS analysis followed by chemometric methods to sort 20 types of polymer</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> Initially, only SVM was used to process the LIBS data, with half of it being used to train the model and the other half to test it. The method was very successful with 99.9% of the samples identified correctly. However, since the number of variables was so high, it took a long time for the processing (the modelling time was nearly two hours and the prediction time was 11.96 s). It is clearly unrealistic for such a slow process to be used in the “real world”. Consequently, the authors employed PCA to decrease the number of variables. When 13 principal components were used prior to input to SVM, the identification rate dropped very marginally to 99.80%, but the time required for processing decreased dramatically such that the processing time was 1.44 s, modelling time was 12.16 s and the prediction time was only 0.02 s. This method is rapid and accurate and could feasibly be used for sorting at a recycling plant.</p>

          <span id="sect1185"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.3.4 Other applications of the analysis of polymers. </span>
          <span>A paper by Makino and Nakazato described the rapid determination of trace elements (Br, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb) with an acceptable degree of accuracy in different polymer types using LA-ICP-MS and <small><sup>13</sup></small>C as an internal standard.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> Numerous CRMs of several different polymer type were analysed; two of which were used for calibration (the ones with the lowest and highest concentration for each element) and the others as samples. The materials included EC680 and EC681 (polyethylene), NMIJ8103a (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), NMIJ8123a (polyvinyl chloride), NMIJ8133a (polypropylene), JSAC0631 and JSAC0632 (polyester). The C content was measured using a CHN analyser and ranged from 45.620% to 85.543%. A Ti–sapphire laser operating at 266 nm was used to ablate the samples and the optimized fluence was 8 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Calibration regression coefficients when the internal standard was not used were respectable (0.8067–0.9980). However, when the <small><sup>13</sup></small>C was used, the regressions improved to 0.9556–0.9993. The worst performing analyte on both occasions was the Cd. Analysis of the other CRMs yielded data that agreed with certified values to within 30%. Precision was variable with RSD values ranging from 3 to 60%. The poorer values for precision were ascribed to inhomogeneity in the sample.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A relatively simple method of determining <span class="italic">Cd and Pb in food contact polymers</span> was described by Henn <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> The microwave-assisted solid sampling method of sample introduction to flame furnace AAS used few chemicals and hence minimized waste and was therefore better for the environment. Sample was weighed into a quartz boat containing a cellulose pellet (mass 20 mg for Cd and 10 mg for Pb) and then soaked in 20 μL of 6 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> ammonium nitrate. The boat was inserted into the introduction device and microwave heated in the presence of oxygen (0.6 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). The analytes released were passed through a quartz transfer tube into a quartz tube placed on an AAS instrument’s burner head. Calibration was achieved through aqueous standards being placed on the cellulose pellet and combusted in the same way as the samples. Limits of quantification were 1.7 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cd and 4.6 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Pb. The accuracy of the method was demonstrated through the analysis of CRMs (BCR 60, DOLT-4 and TORT-2) and through a conventional microwave digestion followed by ICP-MS determination. Results were in good agreement with certified values and many were also in agreement with the alternative method. This was especially true for the analysis of polypropylene. Analysis of HDPE, however, resulted in data only just over half that obtained using the full microwave digestion. This was attributed to additives in the polymer preventing it from combusting efficiently. The method clearly achieves its goal of producing less waste, but the inability to analyse all polymer types is somewhat worrying.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An interesting application was presented by Breuckmann <span class="italic">et al.</span> who determined <span class="italic">C, H, N and O in plastics using the WDXRF Rayleigh and Compton scattering spectra from a rhodium source</span> and partial least squares regression.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> The method was applied to 84 polymer samples, some of which were thermoplastics and others thermoset plastics (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> polyurethane, epoxy resins and polyester resins). The PLS model was trained using 56 of the samples and the other 28 samples were used for validation. The method for model development was described in the paper. The results obtained were compared with those obtained using a standard elemental analyser and, for C, H and O were in good agreement. This is remarkable since H does not usually offer an XRF signal. The results for N were less accurate. This was thought possibly to be because fewer polymers contain N. The method was very encouraging though and the authors thought that it could be used equally successfully with EDXRF instruments, including the portable/handheld ones and be applied to other organic rich materials, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> soils.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The determination of F in polymers suffers from poor emission sensitivity because it is so hard to excite. Weiss <span class="italic">et al.</span> applied LIBS to the analysis of fluoropolymers enabling F to be determined.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a> This was achieved using molecular LIBS rather than the conventional atomic LIBS. A layer of copper foil or of calcium acetate was placed over the sample. As the LIBS laser ablated the sample, the F released interacts with the copper or calcium coating forming CuF or CaF. It is the emission originating from these molecules that is quantified. For the CaF, measurement was in the region of 531 nm and for CuF it was at 493 nm. The F line at 685.6 nm was also monitored for comparison. The linearity and sensitivity were tested by mixing different proportions of PTFE powder (3 μm) with cellulose powder (20 μm) and then pressing into a pellet. A range of pellets with an F content of between 0.6 and 14.5% w/w was obtained. After the layer of Cu or Ca was added, the analysis was undertaken. The LOD for the CuF was marginally better than for CaF (160 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> compared with 240 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and the <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> was also better (0.99 compared with 0.95). When determining the F directly at 685.6 nm, the laser energy had to be much higher (6 mJ compared with the 1.6 mJ for both of the molecular bands). This yielded a LOD similar to that for CuF, but with a poorer <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> value (0.94). The authors noted that although the LOD was similar, the higher energy laser shot required would do much more damage to the sample and would not be applicable to thermally sensitive materials. Since it is possible to undertake a raster across the surface, the method developed is therefore also capable of mapping the surface of the polymers to determine the homogeneity.</p>

            <span class="italic">Epoxy nanocomposites have been the subject of study</span> by Babu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> Aged epoxy micro-nanocomposites were classified using LIBS analysis followed by PCA and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) data treatment. Material was aged in two ways: gamma irradiation using a <small><sup>60</sup></small>Co source at a dosage rate of 600 Gy h<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and water aging by placing sample in distilled water at room temperature and at 90 °C until the weight gain remained unchanged. The LIBS intensities of two Zr lines were used to calculate the plasma temperature and it is this parameter along with the size of the crater that was used to assess the aging state of the material. The plasma temperature decreased and the crater size increased with increased aging, implying that the surface is softer. Data were then input to PCA to reduce the number of data points. Plots of PC1 <span class="italic">vs.</span> PC2 <span class="italic">vs.</span> PC3 for gamma irradiation-aged samples clearly identified those samples that were virgin, had been irradiated to a dose of 4 kGy and those at a dose of 8 kGy. Similar plots for the water-aged samples could also clearly discriminate between virgin material and those samples that had been aged at room temperature and those aged at 90 °C. Discrimination between the methods of aging could also be achieved. Application of an artificial neural network to the data led to even better classification than that achieved using PCA. The clear conclusion was that LIBS may indeed be used to classify the method and extent of aging of these materials.</p>

        <h3 id="sect1231"><span class="b_heading">4.1 Catalysts</span></h3>
        <span>As usual, this has been a very busy area of research, but little of it was research into the atomic spectrometry aspect. There are therefore, relatively few papers to be reviewed out of the many hundreds in the subject area. Papers that report a new catalyst and then simply characterize it using XRF or ICP-OES will not be reviewed as the atomic spectrometry is very routine – even if the catalyst is not. To improve the understanding of catalysts and to design better materials, it is crucial to study them during their catalytic active states. Therefore, what will be reviewed are those papers that use atomic spectrometry to elucidate catalytic mechanisms and therefore help optimize the manufacture or operating conditions. Papers that report the use of on-line atomic spectrometry will also be reviewed for the same reason. Operando spectroscopy (an analytical methodology wherein the spectroscopic characterization of materials undergoing reaction is coupled simultaneously with measurement of catalytic activity and selectivity) is therefore among the more novel aspects of these papers.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper by Pishgar <span class="italic">et al. reviewed, with 246 references, in situ analytical techniques for the investigation of material stability and interface dynamics in electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> Methods discussed included: <span class="italic">in situ</span> UV-vis, ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, <span class="italic">in situ</span> Raman, on-line ICP-MS, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and varying types of microscopy. The advantages, disadvantages and capabilities of each were discussed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Czioska <span class="italic">et al.</span> investigated the <span class="italic">Ir–Ir interaction in iridium oxide during the oxygen evolution reaction at high potentials using operando spectroscopy</span>, in this case, XAS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> Both calcined and uncalcined iridium dioxide nanoparticles were tested in an operando spectro-electrochemical cell. <span class="italic">In situ</span> XAS analysis of the material under different applied potentials indicated strong structural changes when changing the potential. The XAS data were then treated using principal component analysis (PCA) and FEFF9 (a software package for treating X-ray data). It was found that oxygen vacancies and lower oxidation states of Ir were formed at higher potentials. This meant that the model for the oxygen evolution reaction had to be modified. At potentials above 1.5 V stronger Ir–Ir interactions were observed especially in the calcined iridium dioxide samples. The atomic spectroscopy therefore provided insights at the most fundamental levels for this catalyst system.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Laboratory scale <span class="italic">XAS was employed by Huang et al. for the in situ analysis of a palladium catalyst on a compact inverse-Compton scattering X-ray beamline</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> Although XAS is one of the most powerful techniques for catalyst analysis, it suffers the drawback of having X-ray tubes that have a limited spectral flux density. This restricts them to <span class="italic">ex situ</span> or <span class="italic">in situ</span> experiments conducted over a large time scale, especially for X-ray energies above 15 keV. This paper discussed the use of a compact synchrotron facility based on inverse Compton X-ray scattering. It possesses a brilliant, low-divergence, energy-tuneable X-ray beam making it well suited for XAS techniques, especially for <span class="italic">in situ</span> experiments. The catalyst studied was a hydrogen-treated palladium/carbon type that exhibited significantly better decarboxylation activity than a bare palladium metal/carbon catalyst. A series of X-ray absorption near-edge structures (XANES) at the Pd K-edge (24.4 keV) was made, with spectral quality being equivalent to those from a synchrotron but with less than five minutes per spectrum being required. These enabled the authors to identify that the formation of alpha-phase palladium hydride may be the reason for the enhanced performance of the hydrogen-pre-treated Pd/C catalyst.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">development of a system to enable the use of a commercially available gas-cell chip assembly within an X-ray nanoprobe beamline</span> was reported by Parker <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> Its <span class="italic">in situ</span> capability was demonstrated by investigating the redox behaviour of supported platinum nanoparticles on ceria under typical lean and rich diesel-exhaust conditions. Excitingly, the setup allowed complementary techniques such as <span class="italic">in situ</span> transmission electron microscopy and X-ray nanoprobe studies to be used under identical conditions. This has a major advantage compared with other systems because the same cell can be used since it is easily transferred between instruments. Therefore, the same catalyst particles can be studied under identical conditions of gas flow, pressure and temperature using multiple techniques.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In recent years <span class="italic">platinum-based bimetallic alloys have been investigated as an alternative to bare platinum cathode catalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells</span> to improve their cost-effectiveness.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> However, they have a reduced stability, which is poorly understood at a fundamental level. It is necessary to elucidate the entire chain of interconnected degradation mechanisms to formulate a comprehensive model of catalyst degradation that will help interpret bimetallic alloy behaviour. Bogar <span class="italic">et al.</span> combined <span class="italic">in situ</span> ICP-MS with <span class="italic">in situ</span> grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering and <span class="italic">ex situ</span> SEM to study the morphological evolution of Pt<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ni<small><sub>100−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> model catalysts with Ni contents ranging from 0 to 75% that were undergoing potentio-dynamic cycling to two different upper potentials. It was therefore mimicking the different operational conditions of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell. Analysis of the results enabled the authors to develop a methodology to distinguish the influence of Ni dissolution, particle coalescence and Ostwald ripening on particle size distribution and interparticle distance. They could also prepare time-dependent interplay maps to highlight the timeframe in which these phenomena occur. When 1.0 V was used as the upper potential, Ni dissolution was the prevalent force in morphological change. However, at 1.3 V, the Ni dissolution is rapidly overcome by particle coalescence at first and then by Ostwald ripening in the later stages of the investigated time range. The effects were more rapid with increasing Ni concentration.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Iridium catalysts are well known to be the best catalysts in acidic medium for the oxygen evolution reaction because of their stability and relatively high activity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> However, iridium is a scarce and expensive metal and so alternatives are sought. One possibility is to disperse the iridium in titanium dioxide, forming a mixture. However, the extent to which the performance of the mixture can be optimized is unknown. These authors used a scanning flow cell connected to an ICP-MS instrument to examine the activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction of a series of oxidized Ir–Ti thin films covering the composition range from 20–70% Ir. Irrespective of the composition, the Ir dissolution rate was below that of thermally prepared iridium dioxide. In addition, mixtures containing at least 50% Ir had a comparable activity to iridium dioxide. The superior performance was also investigated using XPS and atom probe tomography. Although this application is not strictly operando, the flow cell did enable a real time monitoring of Ir dissolution.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A similar approach was taken by Dukic <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used an <span class="italic">electrochemical flow cell connected to an ICP-MS instrument to monitor the time- and potential-resolved dissolution of carbon-supported intermetallic Pt-alloy electrocatalysts used for the oxygen evolution reaction</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> An in-house designed high-temperature disk electrode was also used in the study. The C dissolution obeyed the Arrhenius law and its dissolved concentration increased exponentially with increasing temperature. Unexpectedly, the Pt dissolution also increased with increasing temperature. This, combined with the dissolution attributed to the rising potential governs the stability of the Pt. In addition, for the Pt alloy electrocatalysts, the Pt dissolution will also affect the dissolution of the other alloying material. Interestingly, the re-deposition rate of Pt also increases with temperature and, in the past, this has led to the mechanistic interpretation of the temperature-dependent kinetics related to the stability of Pt being confounded.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers of interest <span class="italic">have employed LIBS for the analysis of catalysts</span>. One by Jolivet <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the impregnation of alumina with nickel nitrate in the presence of citric acid.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> The wet material was then sampled, cut in half and analysed using LIBS over different maturation times (between 30 s and 23 hours). The LIBS system was described in full, with a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, at an energy of 1.5 mJ and at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. Sample was put on a motorized XYZ translation stage and with the assistance of a 15-fold magnification, the laser target area was highlighted. The translation stage moved in steps of 15 μm and the crater created was less than 15 μm in diameter. Light emitted was transmitted <span class="italic">via</span> fibre optics to two Czerny–Turner spectrometers, each equipped with a CCD. Results obtained using the system were compared with those obtained using the conventional techniques Raman and magnetic resonance imaging. Using LIBS, the analysis time was shortened by a factor of 30 and the low detection limits and its multi-elemental capabilities provided valuable information to understand the phenomena occurring during catalyst impregnation. The conclusion was that LIBS imaging has huge potential as a unique characterization technique capable of simultaneously monitoring the distribution of the metallic precursor, organic additive and support impurities. The other paper to use LIBS was by Burnette <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> These authors studied the iridium-based catalysts used in monopropellant thrusters which have been used for decades to manoeuvre spacecraft. Unfortunately, the degradation or loss of the catalyst is known to limit their lifetime. Thus far, no method has been available to monitor the health of these iridium-based catalysts <span class="italic">in situ</span>. They therefore used a LIBS system to quantify iridium in the gas phase by thermally vaporizing various organometallic iridium compounds with known concentrations within a test cell and then monitoring the resulting iridium signal from optical emission lines that had no interfering lines in the region. The LIBS system employed a pulsed Nd:YAG laser operating at 355 nm with a repetition rate of 10 Hz and with an 11 ns pulse duration. Typically, 75 ± 5 mJ per pulse of laser light was focused down by a planar-convex lens to a spot size of 10 μm. Light emitted from the sample was transmitted through a fibre optic to a Czerny–Turner spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD. The test cell was interesting. It was a Pyrex cell consisting of a six-way cross. The laser entered and exited through transparent windows along one axis of the test cell. The collection optics were aligned perpendicular to the laser path to collect the light emitted from the laser spark. The other ports were to allow hot gas to escape and to allow a thermocouple to be inserted. Detection limits depended on the method used to calculate them and the Ir compound used, but was as low as 6.21 μmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This was the first time that gas phase Ir was detected using LIBS. Work is on-going in an attempt to improve the LOD further.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">The transport of sulfate, chloride, acids and carbon dioxide through the pore structure of concretes usually causes damage. Attempts made to measure the extent of this usually require a bore to be cut through materials like concrete and then mechanical slicing of layers to allow the analysis. Decker <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LA-ICP-MS for the analysis of hardened cement paste, with a focus on the ablation mechanisms of a frequently used 213 nm quintupled Nd:YAG ns laser operating on the multi-phase system in comparison with amorphous and well-characterized NIST 612 glass.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> Aspects investigated included energy-signal considerations, crater evaluations after multiple shots using different energy densities and the morphology of aerosol particulates captured on filters. A linear energy to analyte signal behaviour was observed over the range 2–6 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. It was noted though that the mechanism of ablation was different to that observed in samples such as glass or brass, with the bottom of the craters having a strange “knobby structure”. The same effect was observed after heating the material to 550 °C, so the presence of water was ruled out as a cause.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper by Abramson <span class="italic">et al.</span> employed X-ray emission spectroscopy for precise characterization of the S redox state in cementitious materials and, in particular, cementitious waste forms.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">137</span></sup></a> Cementitious waste forms are containers used to retain radionuclides and so it is important to identify their reductive capacity because many of the contents, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> pertechnetates (Tc<small><sup>VII</sup></small>) are less soluble if reduced to Tc<small><sup>IV</sup></small>. The authors state that the conventional way of determining the S oxidation states in cements is destructive because it relies on the wet chemical methodology of acid digestion in the presence of cerium(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) followed by titration and colorimetric determination. Not only is this destructive, it is also time-consuming and labour intensive. These authors devised a non-destructive method using a high resolution benchtop instrument. Since the materials under investigation are not homogeneous, the instrumental method also has the advantage of being able to map the surface to find S hotspots. The S Kα wavelength around 2305–2310 eV was used to obtain spectra from the prepared cementitious pellets and sulfide and sulfate reference compounds. A doublet was observed, with each peak corresponding to a S species. Armed with sufficient knowledge of the sample composition, it is possible to quantify the S contribution to the cementitious waste form’s total reduction capacity.</p>

However, when concrete from an existing structure is analysed, information regarding the cement and aggregate content is often not available meaning that assumptions have to be made when converting the element content determined in the sample to that based on the cement content in the sample. Inevitably, this will lead to errors. The method reported in this paper prepared model samples and then used LIBS to obtain analytical data and then a machine learning algorithm to identify the cement and aggregate composition. Some of the samples prepared were used to “train” the algorithm while others were used as test samples. The analytes determined were: C, Ca, H and O, with the O data being used for internal normalization. Five machine learning algorithms were tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Ridge Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), with the KNN proving to be most applicable. The algorithm was then incorporated into the LIBS system and tested on a real sample core. The authors predicted that a similar approach could be adopted to numerous other inhomogeneous sample types.</p>

The analysis was undertaken at seven different locations on the spot to ensure representativeness. The operating parameters were optimized, including the gate width (7 μs), delay time (the time between when the analytes start emitting and the measurement) (2.5 μs) and focal length (10.3 cm). Under the optimal conditions, the LOD were 7.98 and 10.57 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Na and Mg, respectively and both calibrations had <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values greater than 0.99.

Several operating parameters were optimized. These included: the mask size and the collimator. For increased sensitivity, a large mask size was required, but this size could be decreased if sufficient analyte was present to ensure that radiation from the edge of the cup was removed. An added bonus was that the smaller 8 mm mask allowed the use of a smaller sample cup, enabling a smaller volume of sample to be used (2 mL). The 34 mm mask required the use of the 10 mL sample cups. The Cl Kα line was used to construct calibration curves. Detection limits ranged from 191 ppm Cl in undiluted A336 (I) to 42 ppm in 70% A336(SCN) in diisobutylketone.

The results were very similar with those from XRF and AAS and were a significant improvement on those obtained using calibration-free LIBS.

This confounded the analysis until the LIBS output was treated using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The paper gave a good description of how the PLSR was used to extract the Sm and Gd data from the overwhelming signal arising from the cerium matrix. The performance of the PLSR was improved further by smoothing the LIBS data using a moving average. Again, the paper described this process thoroughly and clearly. The overall effect was that root mean square error was as little as 0.24 mol%. It was concluded that LIBS measurements in conjunction with the statistical analysis provided a rapid and reliable method that would be useful during the preparation and recycling of solid oxide fuel cells. Another paper that used a statistical method to improve accuracy of LIBS analysis was presented by Lv <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152</span></sup></a> who used it followed by data treatment using an autoencoder neural network to analyse ceramic raw materials. The authors stressed that use of an artificial neural network is potentially a good way to overcome matrix effects but can suffer the drawback of “overfitting”. They therefore developed a model that combined linear regression and the sparse and under-complete (SUAC) autoencoder neural network. This was capable of performing non-linear feature extraction and dimension reduction; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it reduces the amount of information required for the calculations from 8188 to 32 pieces. A model was therefore constructed using these two algorithms in conjunction with back propagation neural network (BPNN). Since the combination of linear regression and SUAC reduces the number of data points so significantly by removing redundant data, the BPNN can formulate the model with greatly reduced risk of overfitting. As a result, the RMSE values obtained for Al and Si using LR-SUAC-BPNN are significantly lower than for other methods, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LR-partial least squares (PLS), LR-SUAC-PLS and no algorithm used, indicating it had the best quantitative analysis performance.</p>

One was for Brazilian samples, another was for imported samples and the largest group was a mixture of both. The group containing the Brazilian samples had, by far, the highest concentrations.

Other parameters optimized included the length and diameter of the plastic transfer tube, the inner and by-pass argon flow rates, the ETV temperature program, the use of graphite grit to help position the sample in the ETV boats and the inner diameter of the ICP torch injector tube. The presence of the trifluoromethane was critical in enabling the analytes to be determined simultaneously, otherwise the strong carbide forming elements, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Mo, V, <span class="italic">etc.</span> were not volatilised quantitatively or reproducibly. Two of the 16 laboratories participating in the certification exercise used this method. Others used a conventional liquid nebulisation approach. The solid sampling approach provided better accuracy and precision than most other methods, even though a sample mass of typically 0.2–0.6 mg was used. The methodology was both rapid and reliable and the authors thought it could possibly also be applied to the analysis of other glass types, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> borosilicate.</p>

        <span>Although a considerable amount of research has been made into electronic materials, especially lithium ion batteries (plus alternatives), solar cells and other thin films, the number of papers reporting advances in atomic spectrometry have remained relatively few.

          <span>Many of the analytical techniques used for this type of analysis are very specialised for surface analysis or, in some cases, capable of obtaining depth-profile data. Techniques such as SIMS, TOF-SIMS, RBS and X-ray-based techniques are therefore prevalent rather than the more normal atomic spectrometry techniques of ICP-OES/-MS, AAS, <span class="italic">etc.</span></span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Kubala-Kukus <span class="italic">et al. described a plethora of low angle X-ray techniques</span> including: total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF), grazing emission X-ray fluorescence (GEXRF), grazing incidence X-ray fluorescence (GIXRF), X-ray reflectometry (XRR) and total reflection X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TRXPS).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit205"><sup><span class="sup_ref">205</span></sup></a> The paper is not a review. Instead it is more of a list of techniques available at the Institute of Physics of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, or the collaborations they have made with other institutions. However, each of the techniques is discussed in individual sections, highlighting their differences, applications, capabilities and limitations. Although the overview is not limited to electronic materials, these are often the techniques of choice for such analyses and this paper summarises the techniques nicely.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The capability of <span class="italic">isotope-dilution (ID)-ICP-MS, Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Medium Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (MEIS) for the analysis of silver – copper (Ag<small><sub>x</sub></small>Cu<small><sub>1−x</sub></small>)</span> thin films was demonstrated by Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit206"><sup><span class="sup_ref">206</span></sup></a> Two sets of five thin films of different mole fractions were prepared by ion beam sputter deposition onto silicon wafers. Nominally, the films ranged from Ag<small><sub>0.14</sub></small>Cu<small><sub>0.86</sub></small> to Ag<small><sub>0.72</sub></small>Cu<small><sub>0.28</sub></small>. One set of films were relatively thick (100 nm) while the other set were thin (10 nm). The thick films were analysed using ID-ICP-MS and RBS whereas the thin films were analysed using ID-ICP-MS and MEIS. Full uncertainty budgets were calculated for each technique. The results for the analysis of the thick films using ID-ICP-MS and RBS were in extremely close agreement. Plotting the data against each other yielded a slope of 0.996 m <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the data were within 0.4% difference. Results obtained using ID-ICP-MS and MEIS for the thin films were also impressive, with agreement to within 1% being obtained. For instance, for the film of nominal composition Ag<small><sub>0.14</sub></small>Cu<small><sub>0.86</sub></small> the ICP-MS results (as a mole fraction) were Ag = 13.4 ± 0.3 and Cu was 86.6 ± 0.3 compared with the MEIS results of 13.3 ± 1.3 and 86.7 ± 1.3 for Ag and Cu, respectively. It can be seen that the ID-ICP-MS method was far more precise; a trend also shown with the other films. The analysis of the thick films yielded an improved precision for the ID-ICP-MS data. The RBS also showed impressive precision but was a factor of three – five times worse. The overall conclusion was that all three techniques could be used to determine the composition of thin films reliably and could therefore be used to characterize certified materials.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Analysis using TOF-SIMS is well known to be excellent at measuring analytes within 2 nm of the surface of a sample. However, interpreting the mass spectra can be complicated. Machine learning methods have been devised to help the process, but the generation of descriptors, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> what to include and what to exclude can be time-consuming and can potentially limit their versatility and practicality. Lang <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a method whereby the <span class="italic">generation of descriptors was not required for TOF-SIMS spectra to be processed into images by the convolutional neural network</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit207"><sup><span class="sup_ref">207</span></sup></a> The authors applied the methodology to the analysis of thin films of different silane coupling agents, sometimes in admixture.

In addition, it exhibited a high degree of automation and versatility and could have the potential to solve challenging issues.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Depth-profiling is always a popular area of research, with greater resolution, better sensitivity, fewer interferences <span class="italic">etc.</span> being sought. This next section describes those papers that have contributed to improving depth-profiling studies. Two papers have used <span class="italic">SIMS employing gas cluster primary ion beams</span> to analyse thin (20–50 nm) extreme ultraviolet photoresist films<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit208"><sup><span class="sup_ref">208</span></sup></a> and organic thin films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209</span></sup></a> The use of gas cluster primary ion beams causes less sputter damage to organic-based films. In the first example, Spampinato <span class="italic">et al.</span> used two SIMS instruments to analyse the photoresists.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit208"><sup><span class="sup_ref">208</span></sup></a> One instrument was a conventional TOF-SIMS instrument whereas the other was equipped with an Orbitrap mass analyser with MS/MS capability meaning that greater mass resolution could be achieved. The operating conditions for both instruments were kept as close as possible so that data could be compared. For instance, both used a sputter beam of Ar<small><sub>2000</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>. The Orbitrap-based instrument had approximately 20 times the resolution of the standard instrument as well as having improved mass accuracy (a few ppm) and this proved crucial for the analysis. The standard TOF-SIMS instrument suffered serious problems associated with mass spectra and depth-profiles exhibiting severe molecular (isobaric) interferences, whereas the Orbitrap-based instrument did not. The second paper, by Muramoto and Graham, also used a 20 keV Ar gas cluster beam for sputtering and a Bi<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> beam for analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209</span></sup></a> Both ion sources struck the sample at an angle of 45°, with a typical cycle comprising one scan of analysis, 10 scans of sputtering and 2 s of charge compensation. Three thin film types were analysed: gelatin, pullulan and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Using SEM and a profilometer to analyse the topography of the craters a linear depth increase was observed with the increase of ion dose. For thicker films (&gt;10 μm), the craters became distorted, with pillar-like structures forming which affected the linearity of the sputter yield and the depth resolution. To reduce this problem, a step-wise rotation of the sample was employed. Although the problem was reduced significantly, “blisters” appeared which still hampered depth-resolution measurements.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Other workers have also employed TOF-SIMS for depth-profiling studies. Kubo <span class="italic">et al.</span> used a <span class="italic">combination of soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) employing Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small> sputtering and TOF-SIMS employing Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> sputtering</span> to monitor the changes in the chemical state of Cr during deposition on a polyimide substrate.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit210"><sup><span class="sup_ref">210</span></sup></a> Depth resolution at the nanoscale was achieved. Evidence from both techniques indicated that there was preferential O sputtering. Samples were therefore re-analysed using cross-sectional electron energy loss spectroscopy and non-destructive hard XPS. As a result, the depth profiles of Cr, Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, Cr(OH)<small><sub>3</sub></small> and CrO<small><sub>3</sub></small> in the chromium thin film were determined. At greater depth, the concentrations of Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, Cr(OH)<small><sub>3</sub></small> and CrO<small><sub>3</sub></small> decreased and Cr and Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O increased. This was attributed to the sputtering by Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> and Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small>. The results were thought to be useful for optimizing the chromium/polyimide fabrication process, which is important because it is one of the most important components in flexible electronics.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Mabrouk <span class="italic">et al.</span> used <span class="italic">TOF-SIMS with low energy Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions for sputtering during the depth-profiling of polymethylmethacrylate thin films</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> The effects of the molecular weight of the material, the film thickness and the beam energy on the sputtering yield were determined. The sputtering yield decreased as the molecular weight increased until a threshold was reached, at which point it remained fairly constant. Sputtering yield increased logarithmically with increasing primary ion beam energy over the range 250–1000 eV. Depth-profiling was undertaken using dual beams, one of Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> for sputtering and the other of 15 keV Bi<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> for analysis of the centre of the crater created by the sputtering. Negative secondary ions were measured. Preliminary experiments were also undertaken for the analysis of low molecular weight thin films (4 kg mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). Similar trends were observed as when an argon gas cluster beam had been used, but the effects were much smaller. This led the authors to conclude that the low energy Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> primary beam had great potential for the analysis of dense, very thin films. Further work in this area was envisaged.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another study to use TOF-SIMS to analyse thin films was presented by Ekar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit212"><sup><span class="sup_ref">212</span></sup></a> These researchers also used a dual beam approach employing 1 keV Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> and 1 keV O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> as the sputter beams and analysed using a Bi<small><sup>+</sup></small> primary ion beam. <span class="italic">Depth-profile analysis of metal, metal oxide and alloy multi-layers in atmospheres containing hydrogen, acetylene, carbon monoxide and oxygen</span> was performed. The samples (FeAgNi) and (CrTiAl) were multilayer structures of Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/Fe/Ag/Ni/NiO and Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/Cr/Ti/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/Al, respectively. The negative secondary ions formed by the samples in the presence of the flooding gases were monitored. A systematic comparison and evaluation of the TOF-SIMS depth profiles was performed regarding the matrix effect, ionization probability, chemical sensitivity, sputtering rate and depth resolution. The presence of acetylene, carbon monoxide and oxygen had some benefits over analysis in a vacuum, but only in specific cases. Since the sputtering rate decreases in the presence of the gases, a much longer time is required for a depth-profile to be acquired. In contrast, the addition of hydrogen did not reduce the sputtering rate and demonstrated improved results (reduced matrix effects) for the sample depth-profile analysis. A further improvement was observed by normalizing the signals. The different layers of the samples could clearly be identified. Further work was to be undertaken analysing the topography of the craters produced in the hydrogen atmosphere.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Techniques other than TOF-SIMS have also been used to obtain depth-profile data. <span class="italic">Glow discharge (GD)-OES has been used by Bouttemy et al. for the characterization of buried interfaces</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> These authors used a combination of pulsed radiofrequency (RF)-GD-OES and XPS to analyse the buried layers, taking advantage of the relatively rapid profiling rate of the GD-OES and then using XPS to analyse the bottom of the GD crater. The samples used were n-type indium phosphide with a S doping level of 1.6 × 10<small><sup>18</sup></small> and of 364 μm thickness. However, there was a problem in that the reliability of the XPS data was compromised by a perturbed layer on the surface of the crater, which is not representative of the initial sample. The authors therefore used hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES), which offered the possibility of probing this layer in a different manner to the normal soft XPS. The soft XPS used Al Kα emitting at 1.49 keV whereas the HAXPES used Ga Kα emitting at 9.25 keV as the source and it is this greater energy that enabled HAXPES to undertake chemical state analysis at a higher sampling depth (50 nm, so approximately three times greater). This enabled analysis below the perturbed layer. Using both XPS and HAXPES, it was possible to discover that the perturbed layer was approximately 10 nm deep, identify the composition of this layer as well as the composition of the bulk material below it.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span> used direct current (DC)-GD-MS for the depth profile analysis of molybdenum disulfide films deposited on aluminium and steel substrates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> The operating conditions were optimized so that a flat-bottomed crater was produced and to ensure that sufficient analyte signal intensity was obtained. The optimum conditions included a discharge current of between 1 and 1.5 mA and a discharge pressure of 4.7 mPa. The resolution of the depth profiles was dependent on the substrate and were 0.55 μm for the film on the aluminium and 0.70 μm for that on the steel. The interface between the substrate and the film was measured to be at a depth of 4.46 μm for the film on the aluminium and 4.55 μm for that on the steel. These values were in reasonable agreement with those obtained using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) which were 4.85 μm and 5.45 μm, respectively. These researchers then used a steel CRM to “validate” the data. Good agreement with certified values was obtained (±12% of certified values), but this is not really a relevant material to analyse when the samples are thin films.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Titanium electrodes and titanium oxide films play an important role in state-of-the-art electronic devices. It is therefore important that they be fully characterized to enable optimal performance. In a paper by Leani <span class="italic">et al.</span> titanium oxide thin films were deposited on titanium substrates using electroformation with varying anodic potential values and with differing electrolyte compositions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit215"><sup><span class="sup_ref">215</span></sup></a> The oxidation state of the Ti at different depths was measured using energy dispersive inelastic X-ray scattering (EDIXS) under grazing incidence conditions.

The results indicated a well-defined distribution of titanium oxides in the (+3) state as compared with the standard (+4) state. This was in good agreement with predictions. The conclusion was that GI-EDIXS can provide valuable information from nanolayers of technological materials.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">calibration-free, real-time organic film thickness monitoring technique using reflected XRF and Compton scattering measurements</span> was devised by Park <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a> The new simple, non-contact and non-destructive real-time film thickness measurement technique proposed to use the simulation of a field process dealing with thin flexible organic films and demonstrated its utility by setting up a bench-top X-ray thickness measurement system. The use of X-ray fluorescence and Compton scattering X-ray radiation reflectance signals for analytes of low <span class="italic">z</span> from films in close contact with a roller produced accurate thickness measurements. For thick films (&gt;1 mm), the Compton scattering method should be used. For very thin films the fluorescence should be used because it has a signal 4.6 times higher than that of the Compton scattering. There is a region in the middle though, where both fluorescence and scattering can contribute. For films of thickness in that region, the analyst must decide which of the techniques to use. Correlation between thickness and signal intensity was excellent for both techniques over the range 0–0.5 mm, with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of 0.997 and 0.999 for fluorescence and Compton scattering, respectively. The experimental setup was discussed in the paper. The method is potentially of use for the on-line measurement of organic thin films during preparation.</p>

            <span class="italic">Ruthenium and carbon thin films are used in multilayer monochromators over the range 8–20 keV</span>.

The raw data obtained using XRR were subject to several mathematical models: Parratt recursive formalism, Motofit (an algorithm that uses the Abeles matrix/Parratt recursion and least squares fitting) and a method to try and model the roughness. The layer thickness, roughness and densities obtained from GIXRF-XRR analyses were then used to recalculate field intensity inside the stack. A deviation of 10% in depth from the optimum in the top cladding layer and of 5% in the guiding layer as well as the presence of a 1 nm thick top layer resulted in a significant deterioration of the field intensity. This demonstrated the control required during manufacture which could be facilitated by atomic spectrometry.</p>

During the depth-profiling analysis, both systems produced a crater approximately 0.2 μm deep per laser shot. However, the commercial system produced a top hat-shaped crater, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> one with vertical sides and a flat bottom which is ideal. The laboratory-made instrument produced a Gaussian-shaped crater which is far from ideal. Eight analytes (Ag, Al, Ca, H, K, Mg, Na and Si) were determined, with only the laboratory made system being able to determine Mg. This was attributed to the commercial instrument having poorer sensitivity in the UV region whereas the lab-based instrument had poorer sensitivity in the near IR region. The origin of these contaminants was identified as were their diffusion characteristics through the material. In general, the results obtained using the two systems were in agreement.</p>

This had the effect of lowering the hole injection efficiency and shifting the carrier recombination zone toward the interface. An accumulation of excitons and hole polarons then induce quenching that results in molecular breakdown and device degradation.

          <span>A review paper by Lin <span class="italic">et al.</span> entitled “<span class="italic">Advanced in situ characterization of nanocomposite electrodes for sodium ion batteries – a short review</span>” that contained 80 references was presented.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit221"><sup><span class="sup_ref">221</span></sup></a> Sodium ion batteries are becoming increasingly popular because sodium is more plentiful than lithium used in the current lithium ion batteries. However, there are problems associated with their use, such as poor cycling life, low energy density and they can have serious side reactions. Nanocomposite electrodes have the advantage of high structural stability and excellent conductivity. For the best possible performance, a good understanding of the structural and kinetic processes occurring during the charging discharging process is required. This is assisted by using <span class="italic">in situ</span> analysis techniques and these have been summarised in this review paper. A lengthy section on TEM, another for XED, a third for Raman and another for XAS were presented. In the XAS section, the authors split the subject into X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The two are related, but offer different information based on the energy position of the edge. The XANES is sensitive to the chemical bonding, whereas EXAFS depends on the atomic arrangement around the absorber.

          <p class="otherpara">Several papers have discussed the <span class="italic">analysis of waste or end of life electronic materials</span>.

The full methodology for each was given in the paper. Unsurprisingly, the accuracy and precision of the resulting data depended on the methodology adopted. Smelting in the presence of borax at 1350 °C led to losses of volatile analytes (especially Zn and, to a lesser extent, Cu) and was quickly discarded as a means of pre-processing. The ashing at 500 °C was however, a viable process. Some acid dissolution processes resulted in an insoluble residue that could only be brought into solution using a fusion technique. This extra step, although largely successful, adds to the time and hence cost of the analysis. The most successful analytical protocol involved the use of aqua regia and hydrofluoric acid in a microwave digester at elevated pressure (30 bar) and at 180 °C, followed by ICP-OES analysis. Particle size also had an influence. Smaller particles were more homogeneous, but more difficult to obtain (requiring more grinding <span class="italic">etc.</span>). The authors called for the production of a suitable certified reference material so that the accuracy of this challenging analysis can be determined.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The recycling of materials can be very lucrative, however, the measurement of analytes such as <span class="italic">rare earth elements (REE) can be troublesome using ICP-OES because their emission spectra are extremely line-rich</span> and the elements tend to interfere with each other. However, ICP-OES is usually chosen as the means of analysis because it is cheaper than ICP-MS. A paper by Patil <span class="italic">et al.</span> studied these interferences in complex electronic waste feeds.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit223"><sup><span class="sup_ref">223</span></sup></a> These authors used 27 wavelengths recommended by the ICP-OES software for nine REE and then chose 445 line positions adjacent to them that originate from non-REE concomitants. The net intensity measured at each line position was calculated by subtracting the raw intensity of the blank sample (1% nitric acid solution) measured at the same wavelength. Two dimensional diagrams were constructed that mapped the interferences. An interference correction algorithm was prepared and then tested on waste from fluorescent lamps that contain over 50 elements. The approach used measured intensities of the analyte and interfering elements at different wavelengths and is independent of the analyte concentrations. It was more effective than the calculated intensities with conventional instrument software or interference correction that have difficulty correcting for interferences in complex samples such as e-waste. It was thought that the algorithm could be used for any type of e-waste.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Chemical inspection of electronic waste was achieved using data obtained using LIBS, LA-ICP-MS and μ-XRF by Andrade <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit224"><sup><span class="sup_ref">224</span></sup></a> Both univariate and multivariate chemometric tools were used for calibration purposes for LIBS and μ-XRF. The univariate method involved plotting the ICP-OES reference value (<span class="italic">x</span> axis) against the value obtained using LIBS or XRF (<span class="italic">y</span> axis) and creating a linear model. The multivariate methods involved the use of partial least squares regression to combine the auto-scaled analytical signals from both techniques and reference concentrations determined using ICP-OES. Data obtained using LIBS, LA-ICP-OES and μ-XRF were input to PCA for calculation using the auto-scaled data. The score values were arranged to build the maps of scores and associated with its corresponding loading vector (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> to provide spectral information). In general, the univariate calibration approach failed, with very poor correlation coefficients and standard error of calibration values being obtained. The multivariate calibration approach was more successful. The overall approach of data fusion and chemometric analysis was a powerful alternative to obtaining data from such samples and enabled the authors to build regression models with better statistical parameters such as lower percent errors, better accuracy and reliability.</p>

The sample was on a translation stage and the spectrometer was of the Paschen–Runge design, with eight CCD around the 500 mm Rowland circle. The spectral range was 234–545 nm. A 500 mm × 500 mm circuit board could be analysed for the important analytes Ag, Au, Cu, Nb, Nd, Pd, Ta and W in &lt;30 s.

In simple ICP-MS/MS, the reaction cell gas was hydrogen and oxygen (2 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.3 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively) or hydrogen, helium and ammonia. These mixtures helped overcome the presence of argide ions. The mixture including the ammonia yielded marginally better results, with sensitivity increasing slightly and background equivalent concentrations decreasing slightly. The other method involved mass shift, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> where a component of the reaction gas adds to the analyte so that the effective mass determined is analyte + reaction gas. This was used for analytes such as Cu, Ni and Zn. For this, the addition of helium and ammonia was compared with the addition of ammonia, helium and hydrogen. Again, the three component mixture had a better effect on interference removal whilst simultaneously increasing sensitivity. Since no suitable reference material is available, results were compared with those obtained using a sector field (SF)-ICP-MS instrument. For the SF-ICP-MS measurements, the resolution was set for each analyte to ensure interference free measurements. Therefore, low resolution was used for: Ag, Ba, Cd, Pb and Sb; medium resolution was used for Al, Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Ti, V and Zn and high resolution was used for Cr, Fe and K. For 17 of the 18 analytes determined, there was no significant difference between the two sets of data; the exception being Fe. For the triple quad instrument methods, recoveries of spiked samples were in the range 92.4–108% and precision was typically 5–6%. The other paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit227"><sup><span class="sup_ref">227</span></sup></a> was similar in structure but differed in that it measured only 13 analytes in the different matrix and also compared nitrous oxide with oxygen and ammonia/helium as a reaction gas. The nitrous oxide donated O better than oxygen alone and hence results for most analytes were significantly improved compared with the introduction of oxygen alone. All analytes had a lower LOD when nitrous oxide was used, but some had a better sensitivity when oxygen was added (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> V). When compared with the addition of helium/ammonia, the results for nitrous oxide were mixed. In general, similar LOD were obtained, but the sensitivity of detection was improved for some analytes and seriously degraded for others. Spike/recovery experiments were again used yielding recoveries of 92.5–107%. Precision using the nitrous oxide was typically 2–5.3% RSD.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers by Kroger <span class="italic">et al.</span> used <span class="italic">single particle ICP-OES measurements to determine microparticles in lithium ion batteries</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit228"><sup><span class="sup_ref">228,229</span></sup></a> In the first, a lithium transition metal oxide mixture Li(Ni<small><sub>1/3</sub></small>Co<small><sub>1/3</sub></small>Mn<small><sub>1/3</sub></small>)O<small><sub>2</sub></small> cathode material (known as NCM111) was analysed. The powder (200 μg) was injected into the top of an s-shaped gravitational counter flow classifier that had been made in house and argon introduced at the bottom. The argon flow continued through the classifier, exiting at the top and entering, <span class="italic">via</span> a chamber with an extra argon gas flow, an ICP-OES instrument where Li and Mn were determined. This on-line system therefore enabled the particles to be separated according to their size distribution, with smaller particles reaching the plasma first. The authors noted that prior to introduction, the particles had to be agitated on a laboratory shaker to avoid agglomeration. The gas flow through the classifier was optimised and results indicated that at higher gas flow (20 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), the fraction of particle size &lt; 1.2 μm was 60 ± 8%. This compared with a value of 81 ± 5% for a flow rate of 3 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The difference was attributed to the higher flow rate transporting larger particles much more efficiently. The plasma power and the makeup gas flow were also optimised. The particle size LOD was approximately 0.5 μm. Results were compared with those obtained using SEM and were in good agreement. Although particles as large as 10 μm could be separated, a problem with incomplete evaporation/excitation once in the plasma occurred. The method was therefore effectively limited to particles of &lt;2 μm. In the other paper, a similar material (NCM 532, Li(Ni<small><sub>0.5</sub></small>Co<small><sub>0.3</sub></small>Mn<small><sub>0.2</sub></small>)O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) was studied to try and obtain insights into the state-of-charge distribution of the battery electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> This could be achieved by measuring the Li content of individual cathode active material particles, which enabled a statistically viable elucidation of the mesoscale state-of-charge distribution between different particles.

Both techniques identified a persistent mesoscale heterogeneity of the electrode upon delithiation at slow rates and extensive relaxation times.

Prior to the isotope ratio measurements, the total Li was determined using ICP-OES. As an alternative method, the samples were also analysed using multi-collector ICP-MS. For the HR-CS-ETAAS measurements, sample (10 μL of 25 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) was used with an optimized temperature program and the reactive gas 1% trifluoromethane in argon to prevent the formation of lithium carbides and, hence, carry over/memory effects between samples.

Any gases emitted over a 40 minute period were then analysed on-line using LIBS which employed a Nd:YAG laser, optics, a chamber in which the LIBS analysis occurred and a spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD. The analytes of interest were: Al, C, Co, Cu, F, H, Li and P; however, emissions from Al, Co, and Cu were not found and only short-lived emissions from Na were detected. Emission from the batteries was not uniform. Although C and H were produced throughout the process, other analytes such as F, Li, Na and P were detected at different and irregular times. This was, according to the authors, indicative of analyte bearing particles being emitted from the battery. The authors also developed a calibration scheme for total C.

This reference- or reference sample-free XRF is based upon radiometric and dimensional knowledge of all instrumental and experimental parameters as well as good knowledge of X-ray fundamental parameters and helps overcome the lack of certified materials. A total of 50 full battery cycles with elevated cut off voltage were applied and the amount of Mn deposited on the anode was 1.6 parts per thousand. This led to a decrease in capacity of 12.5%. The NEXAFS analysis of the Mn L- and K-edges of the deposits enabled the study of the oxidation state. Furthermore, by applying different excitation energies, different depths of the deposits were investigated. The Mn was present as the divalent and tetra-valent forms, with the tetra-valent form being present solely in the anode bulk rather than the deposits. The understanding of the degradation process will help the prevention of it in future lithium ion batteries.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">analysis of high purity quartz</span> has featured in two papers. In one by Busam <span class="italic">et al.</span> the solid, fused high purity quartz was analysed using direct current GD-MS employing indium of 7N purity as a secondary cathode.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> Quartz is a non-conducting material and can therefore present problems during analysis. In this method, a secondary cathode is sputtered onto the sample during the discharge. These sputtered ions on the sample then attract some plasma and re-sputter the cathode material as well as some sample material. The secondary cathode material is also known as “masking material”. In this way, non-conducting samples can be determined reliably and with much higher sensitivity. The operating conditions had to be optimized because the successful deposition on the sample depends on the pressure used (too high means the sample is completely coated, too low leads to poor deposition and an unstable discharge). The deposition success then dictates the voltage and current to be used. The relative sensitivity factors were calculated with respect to Si = 1 and to Fe = 1. Both sets were in agreement to within a factor of two with previously published data. Under the conditions used (current = 0.3 mA, voltage = 1.5 kV, Ar flow = 0.17 standard cubic centimetres per minute and pressure = 4.9 × 10<small><sup>−5</sup></small> mbar) they were adequate for the task. Using the Faraday cup detectors for determining the analytes at higher concentration and the ion counters for the lower concentration analytes meant that a sample could be analysed in 10 min. Detection limits were at the ppb range which were better than those reported previously when a tantalum mask was used. The other paper to report the analysis of high purity quartz was presented by Devi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit235"><sup><span class="sup_ref">235</span></sup></a> These authors presented a “bottom-up approach of uncertainty evaluation” for the TXRF analysis of the material whilst participating in a proficiency testing program. The material was first dissolved using hydrofluoric and nitric acids to evaporate the Si as the tetrafluoride. After repeated treatments with nitric acid, the analytes Ca, Fe, K and Ti were determined using TXRF employing the internal standard (Ga) method. The z-score, zeta-score and quality control sample analysis data revealed the accuracy of the data. The relative sensitivity of the instrument for the analyte with respect to the internal standard provided the highest contribution to the uncertainty. The LOD were: 0.95, 0.30, 1.86 and 0.94 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Ca, Fe, K and Ti, respectively.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have discussed the <span class="italic">LIBS analysis of outdoor insulators for high power transmission lines</span>. Contaminants such as aluminium phosphate, glucose and others are hygroscopic, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> they absorb water, and can therefore cause flashovers even at relatively low humidity.

Using the atomic signal of P and over a discrete humidity range, the emission intensities from the spectral lines were normalized. This reduced the effect of the moisture content on the LIBS signal significantly. This standoff analysis is very rapid and has the advantage of not needing to shut the power off.

Field aged insulators were compared with pristine ones with the LIBS system also undertaking depth-profiling analysis, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it ablated the same spot sequentially. The emission intensity ratio of Si to Al was used as a measure of degradation, with the ratio decreasing by approximately 30% at the degraded surface compared with the bulk. A significant decrease in Si occurred up to a depth of 300 μm compared with pristine insulators. These results were confirmed by SEM-EDS measurements. The conclusion again was that LIBS was potentially a very good technique for monitoring degradation of the insulators and its on-line/standoff capability makes it safe, rapid and has the important advantage of not requiring the power to be shut down.</p>

            <span class="italic">Contamination control during the production of silicon wafers</span> is obviously an exceptionally important matter.

The aqueous solution contained either ions (Co, Cu, Si and Zn) at a concentration of 10 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> or nanoparticles (copper indium sulfide/zinc sulfide quantum dots) of two different particle size ranges (4–7 nm and 15–19 nm). The droplets were allowed to dry naturally prior to analysis. The drying mechanism was studied extensively, with evaporation not occurring at the same rate throughout the process. The LA-ICP-MS data showed that for the ions all analytes except Si collected at the intersection of the wall and the bottom of the well, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> they migrated radially across the droplet as it dried, forming a ring. The smaller nanoparticles showed the same trend, but with the ring being slightly less pronounced. The smaller nanoparticles therefore acted in a similar way to the ions. The larger nanoparticles did not behave this way. These were distributed randomly demonstrating that particle size affects the distribution. Extrapolating their results to those for the cleaning solutions used on a full-sized wafer enabled the authors to deduce that similar conclusions could be made.

          <span>A number of <span class="italic">reviews covering NP measurements</span> have been published this year. The first of these (380 references), by Huang <span class="italic">et al.</span>, covered the use of mass spectrometry for the multi-dimensional characterisation of natural and synthetic nanomaterials (NMs).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240</span></sup></a> The techniques covered, ES-MS, FT-ICR-MS, ICP-MS, MALDI-MS and SIMS, show the range required to be able fully to characterise nanomaterials in applications such as bulk and surface composition, size, stability, source tracing and the distribution and fate in the environment and organisms. Probably the most popular single technique for NP detection and characterisation is single nanoparticle (sNP) ICP-MS and the analytical applications of this technique, with 308 references, were recently reviewed by Bolea <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241</span></sup></a> The paper gives a brief introduction to the technique, defines the various measurands normally determined and also has a useful section on method validation, in which the authors pointed out that methods for calculating the LOD values for particle size and particle number concentration are varied and have yet to be agreed upon. The review then covers a number of different application areas, sample preparation and also the coupling of various separation techniques, including CE, FFF and different modes of chromatography, complementary techniques such as TEM, and finally immunoassays and biomolecule quantification. The authors concluded that although sNP-ICP-MS is becoming a mature technique, progress to this level is currently hampered by the lack of validated methods and the traceability of their results, which is due to the lack of matrix reference materials. A separate review, by Resano <span class="italic">et al.</span> (216 references) covered the underlying concepts behind single event-ICP-MS, which is needed to fully understand its potential, and also highlights key application areas, (sNP-ICP-MS or single cell-ICP-MS) and also the emerging area of micro/nanoplastic detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit242"><sup><span class="sup_ref">242</span></sup></a> The review gave a comprehensive guide to the principles of short transient signal measurements, the steps needed to undertake these analyses, the calculations involved and the progress in sNP and single cell ICP-MS since their inception. Again, the authors also noted the lack of available CRMs for method validation. Each of these reviews are recommended reading for practitioners new to the field or those wishing to update their knowledge.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">In sNP-ICP-MS the baseline signal from dissolved or ‘ionic’ forms of the element(s) under study is one of the governing factors, with plasma instability and detector noise also contributing, for the obtainable LOD. It is therefore becoming increasingly common for a separation technique to be used to reduce the baseline signal during sNP-ICP-MS measurements and Lespes <span class="italic">et al.</span> have reviewed the use of FFF for NP characterisation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit243"><sup><span class="sup_ref">243</span></sup></a> The review (78 references) covered the theory of FFF, with the objective being to link the retention of nanoscale analytes and the characteristics of these analytes involved in their separation as well as method performance. The coupling of the various detectors used, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> dynamic light scattering (DLS), multi-angle light scattering (MALS), ICP-MS and UV as well as the various applications reported in the literature were reviewed. A prediction of the future trends that may arise was also presented. The authors concluded that FFF is a versatile technique for NP characterisation when combined with the various detectors discussed and can be used to elicit both NP size and chemical information and has the potential to provide a metrological solution for NP characterisation. A second review (103 references) in this area by Bai <span class="italic">et al.</span> dealt explicitly with the use of flow field-flow fractionation (F4) prior to ICP-MS for NP detection in environmental samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit244"><sup><span class="sup_ref">244</span></sup></a> The review covered the basic theory of F4-ICP-MS, recent advances in its application to environmental samples and the characterisation of corona-coated NPs. The authors concluded that it is still not possible to differentiate between naturally occurring and engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in environmental samples, that a combination of analytical techniques, which could include <span class="italic">e.g.</span> FT-ICR-MS, are required to investigate surface bound components of NPs and that large injection volumes could be used to allow ecotoxicological studies of NPs to be conducted at environmentally relevant NP concentrations.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Laycock <span class="italic">et al.</span> have systematically reviewed (159 references) the <span class="italic">determination of metallic NPs in biological samples using sNP-ICP-MS</span>, covering the entire process from sample collection to analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> The review showed that most research has been conducted on a limited range of engineered nanomaterials (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Ag and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and that there is a lack of information for some important tissue types (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, reproductive organs, skin and fatty endocrine organs). The authors also reported that the importance of storage on particle stability, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> agglomeration, is often overlooked and that few studies assess the impact of the extraction reagents used on the formation of NPs by transformation of endogenous ‘ionic’ forms of the target analyte into new particulates. It was also stated that a ‘one size fits all’ extraction protocol, which would be attractive from a regulatory perspective, that is applicable to all possible types of engineered nanomaterial and biological matrices, does not seem practical. Alkaline-based extractions would appear to show greater promise for wide applicability to animal tissues, whilst enzymatic based approaches have a role, especially for plant tissues. It was also reported that, as noted earlier in this section, there is a lack of consistency in the particle metrics reported and how they are determined (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> size limit of detection, and proportions of recovery), which makes comparison between studies more difficult. The paper ended with a series of recommendations with the aim of establishing standardised protocols for regulatory use, an internationally agreed nomenclature, that suitable CRMs need to be produced along with the use of control samples during the analytical procedure.</p>

The addition of metal ions to the particle surface proved of limited use because of insufficient adsorption hence low sensitivity and a high baseline from unadsorbed ions whilst the use of an organometallic Pb compound proved laborious with regard to sample preparation. Labelling with metal NPs was considered to be a promising tool for the detection and quantification of nanoplastics in aqueous matrices using SP-ICP-MS.

          <span>There have been two reports on <span class="italic">interlaboratory studies concerning NPs</span> this year. The first of these was by Minelli <span class="italic">et al.</span> and described the outcome of the measurement of particle number concentration of 30 nm Au NPs and was conducted under the Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> A total of 50 laboratories participated, with 74 different measurement reports submitted, and the methods used were particle tracking analysis (PTA), sNP-ICP-MS, UV-Vis spectroscopy, centrifugal liquid sedimentation and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The study provided quantitative data allowing the repeatability and reproducibility of these methods, which followed a common measurement protocol, to be evaluated. It was found that the population-averaging methods, CLS, SAXS and UV-Vis exhibited a high measurement repeatability and reproducibility, with the between-lab variability being 2.6%, 11% and 1.4% respectively. However, the authors stated that the results may be significantly biased for reasons including inaccurate material properties, the values of which are used to compute the number concentration. Particle-counting method results (PTA and sNP-ICP-MS) were less reproducible than the population-averaging methods, with measured between-lab variability of 68% and 46% for PTA and spICP-MS, respectively. The paper gave a wealth of detail on the techniques used, analytical results and the interpretation thereof and is well worth reading. In sNP-ICP-MS the accurate knowledge of the transport efficiency of the sample to the plasma is fundamental for the correct determination of both particle number concentration and size and an interlaboratory study on this topic was published by Geiss <span class="italic">et al.</span> in the period covered by this review.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250</span></sup></a> The transport efficiency was systematically determined on three different days with six carefully characterised Au NP suspensions in seven European and US laboratories using different ICP-MS instruments and sNP-ICP-MS software. Two methods for quantifying transport efficiency: particle size and particle frequency, were evaluated in the study. The resulting transport efficiencies did not deviate much under ideal conditions. The particle frequency method however systematically resulted in lower transport efficiencies. The extent of this difference (0–300% rel. difference) depended largely on the choice and storage conditions of the nanoparticle suspensions used for the determination. The particle size method is recommended when the principal measurement objective is particle size. If the main aim of the measurement is the determination of the particle number concentration, the particle frequency approach could be preferred as it might better account for particle losses in the sample introduction system.</span>

          <span>This section covers <span class="italic">research into the fundamental aspects of sNP-ICP-MS</span> and one example of this is research covered in two papers into the occurrence of spikes in the time scan from very dilute NP suspensions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> The researchers show that, at the very limit of dilution, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the spikes present in a time scan and the points of discontinuity of the outcome of a homogeneous Poisson process and that this relationship underlies the random nature of the sp-ICP-MS time scan. The difference between the number of nanoparticles having entered the plasma of the instrument and the number of detectable spikes in the time scan increases in a strongly nonlinear fashion with the particle number concentration. This counting bias is attributed to particle event coincidences in the time scan and the authors show that the counting bias is related to a stochastic process that models the spike occurrences in the time scan which turns out to be amenable to analytical methods and yields universal predictions. It was also established that the stochastic processes describing the nanoparticle arrivals in the plasma and the time sequence of spikes in the time scan are fully identical, thus helping to place on firmer grounds a frequently made hypothesis regarding the Poissonian character of the sNP-ICP-MS time scan. Monte Carlo simulations and experiments with gold nanoparticle dispersions, for the full spectrum of particle number concentration values tested were also undertaken to confirm the theoretical observations. Data processing in sNP-ICP-MS is either by software provided by the instrument manufacturers or independently developed spreadsheets, such as that provided by RIKILT in the Netherlands, or software programs such as that developed in Sweden. An addition to this tool bag, an open-source Python-based SP/SC ICP-MS data processing platform with an interactive graphical user interface was described by Lockwood <span class="italic">et al.</span> in a recent paper.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252</span></sup></a> The program allows the analysis of large data sets, uses efficient and transparent algorithms and Gaussian and Poisson-based data filtering enables fit for purpose thresholding of particle signals from background noise. The software can also be used for LA-sNP-ICP-MS and other data sets that contain drifting or variable backgrounds. Signals from ICP-MS of single particles or single cells recorded with multiple data points can be integrated and several distinct calibration and processing pathways are available for use to determine particle masses, sizes, and number concentrations, or to calculate intracellular concentrations. Statistical parameters including means, medians, ionic background levels and LOD values are also calculated by the software. The paper presents the theory of the calculations and gives examples involving TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs in surface water, microplastic particles in soil and the C content across individual cells.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Donahue <span class="italic">et al.</span> demonstrated the feasibility of dual analyte quadrupole SP-ICP-MS to quantify chemical transformations and reaction kinetics at the sNP level <span class="italic">in situ</span> for bimetallic NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> The work required optimisation of the collision cell parameters, quadrupole mass analyser settling time and the detector dwell time and full details of this is given in the ESI discussion.

Further experiments involved real time monitoring to quantify the chemical composition and reaction kinetics of individual Ag/Au bimetallic NPs. This allowed the individual bimetallic nanoparticle mass and chemical composition changes during two different chemical reactions: (i) nanoparticle etching and (ii) element deposition on nanoparticles to be determined at a rate of 300+ NPs per min.

          <span>Gold NPs are usually analysed as they can be <span class="italic">used as a calibrant in sNP-ICP-MS or are uptaken by cells</span> when used as a drug delivery agent. Workers at NIST have undertaken a rigorous assessment of the capabilities of sNP-ICP-MS for assessing the particle number concentration of Au NP suspensions of different sizes (30, 60 and 100 nm) and coatings (citrate, branched polyethylenimine, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a> Calibration of the ICP-MS instrument was by using NIST SRM8013 NPs and a comprehensive estimation of the expanded uncertainty for particle number concentration determination was carried out. The mean particle size or the particle size distribution obtained by different reference sizing techniques was first assessed for NIST AuNP RM 8012, nominal diameter 30 nm followed by that for the coated NPs under study (<span class="italic">n</span> = 1). Regardless of NP size or coating, a good agreement, of between 90 and 110% relative, between the sNP-ICP-MS direct determination of particle number concentration and reported particle number concentration was obtained for all of the suspensions studied only when reliable in-house Au mass fractions and thorough mean particle size determinations were included in the calculation of the derived particle number concentrations. The use of the particle size distribution over the mean size to derive particle number concentrations resulted in larger differences for materials with a low contribution (&lt;2%) of smaller NPs (30 nm), materials with a higher polydispersity (100 nm), or materials with two distinct subpopulations of particles (60 nm), regardless of NP coating. The major contribution to the expanded uncertainty for the particle number concentration direct values was due to the variability in the number of observed particle events for the sample and the calibration standard. The paper, which is one of few published which considers an uncertainty budget for sNP-ICP-MS measurements, contains a wealth of information on the entire process and should be read by all practitioners in the field. Using flow injection (FI) for sample introduction in sNP-ICP-MS simplifies the determination of NP mass concentration by eliminating the requirements to measure the sample uptake rate and the transport efficiency. As the inherent sample in FI degrades the sensitivity and LOD of the measurement an alternative approach, mono-segmented flow analysis can be used. This involves the injection of a discrete volume of sample into a pocket of air within the carrier fluid which minimises sample dispersion and can also improves sample throughput. Experiments using this approach for the determination of 50 nm Au NPs were reported by Williams and Beauchemin.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> Sample transport efficiency increased from 6.3% (FI-sNP-ICP-MS) to 8.4% using mono-segmented flow analysis -sNP-ICP-MS) and this factor, in combination with the square-wave shape of the MSFA peak, improved the sensitivity of the measurements. The Au NP particle size was measured with 0.6% RSD although the particle size LOD increased from 13 nm (for FI) to 38 nm.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Single-cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry has been introduced for the analysis of intracellular essential elements and nanoparticles (NPs) at the single cell level although it can be a challenge to produce accurate and reliable results.

The mass of Au in the cells measured using single cell-ICP-MS was in statistical agreement with the mass determined by conventional ICP-MS analysis after an acidic digestion procedure.

The optimal sample treatment was shown to be the addition of TMAH to a final concentration of 1% with no further sample preparation required. Particle sizes were, in all cases, in accordance with values determined using TEM or SEM. Particle concentration recoveries ranged between 92 and 101% whilst the precision obtained for particle number and mass concentrations was &lt;1% RSD. The LOD values for size and concentration were 21.6 nm and 1.9 × 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> particles per L, respectively. The influence of matrix on the determination of Pt NP sizes and number- and mass-based concentrations was evaluated. Studies suggested that the Pt NPs were stable in male urine for 24 hours but this was not the case for the particle number concentrations of 50 nm Pt NPs in female urine samples.

          <span>The most commonly studied NPs using ICP-MS are probably Ag due to their widespread use as an antibacterial agent and two papers <span class="italic">report their detection in biological systems</span>. The first of these, by Zanoni <span class="italic">et al.</span>, used porcine buccal mucosa, mounted on vertical Franz diffusion cells, as an <span class="italic">in vitro</span> model to investigate the penetration of Ag NPs (19 ± 5 nm <span class="italic">Ø</span>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> The permeability experiments were performed using a physiologically-relevant saline solution in the receiver chamber and known concentrations of Ag NPs or ions in the donor chamber, all under physiological pH conditions. The passage of Ag ions and NPs through the mucosa was evaluated using sNP-ICP-MS and a flux of 4.1 ± 1.7 ng cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with a lag time of 159 ± 17 min was observed through mucosa exposed to silver NPs. The authors suggested that the NPs travel through the porcine mucosa and release Ag<small><sup>+</sup></small> in the receptor fluid, which agreed with the predictions of a computational model. The authors also suggested that, due to physiological similarity between human and pig membranes, it is reasonable to assume that a trans-oral mucosa penetration could occur in humans upon contact with silver NPs. The second study in this area, by Kohl <span class="italic">et al.</span>, investigated the translocation of Ag and Au NPs across the gastrointestinal barrier along with related biological effects using an <span class="italic">in vitro</span> 3D-triple co-culture cell model.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit261"><sup><span class="sup_ref">261</span></sup></a> Analysis using sNP-ICP-MS of the samples resulting from incubations with Caco-2 in high glucose DMEM revealed a time-dependent increase of translocated NPs independent of their size, shape, surface charge and stability in cell culture medium. This quantitative data provided the experimental basis for the successful mathematical description of the NP transport kinetics using a non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. <span class="italic">In vitro</span> assays and quantitative PCR showed no significant influence of the applied NPs on both cell viability and generation of reactive oxygen species. The use of TEM indicated that the cell barrier remained intact during the translocation study.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Some form of <span class="italic">extraction and or preconcentration method is usually needed for the assessment of the NP concentration in natural waters</span>, which is generally low. This is due, in part, to the high volume of the receiving body but also due to particle agglomeration and removal processes through adsorption onto natural particles. Filtration, with the expectation that NPs will pass through 0.45 μm membranes is often used as a clean-up step. The effect of six different filter membrane materials (cellulose acetate, nylon, polyethersulfone (PES), polypropylene, PTFE and polyvinylidene difluoride) on the stability of Ag and CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs in spiked rain and river waters was evaluated by Jreije <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit255"><sup><span class="sup_ref">255</span></sup></a> The filtrates were analysed using sNP-ICP-MS and the residues on the filter membranes using ICP-MS after a HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> extraction. For Ag NPs, the highest recoveries were observed for polypropylene membranes, with 55% and 75% recoveries being found for rain and river waters, respectively. For CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs, recoveries for the polypropylene membrane were 60% in rainwater and 75% in river water. Membrane pre-conditioning with mono-, di- or tri-valent metal salts or a commercially available 21 element solution increased NP recoveries to over 80%. The authors concluded that NP retention on the filters was attributable to particle aggregation and that a mass balance approach should be adopted when quantifying NPs in natural water samples. An alternative approach to filtration is the use of magnetic solid phase extraction of Ag based NPs and this was reported by Urstoeger <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit270"><sup><span class="sup_ref">270</span></sup></a> Ten different types of Ag based NPs were synthesised for this work, AgCl, Ag<small><sub>2</sub></small>S and eight with an Ag core but with different organic coatings and these were spiked at concentrations of between 5 and 200 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> into high purity water adjusted to a pH of 6.2 with an acetic acid<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>sodium acetate buffer. Iron oxide magnetic particles were then added to give concentrations ranging from 1 to 500 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the mixture sonicated for 60 s, and shaken for 1 hour. The iron oxide magnetic particles were then attracted to a magnet external to the solution container, removed from solution and the collected NPs eluted with EDTA. Analysis was achieved using sNP-ICP-MS. River water and water with added natural organic matter were also spiked and extracted in the same manner. Extraction efficiencies ranged from 80 to 100% and environmentally relevant inorganic ions and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> particles exhibited no major effect on the extraction efficiency. This was not the case for samples with natural organic matter added to above 1 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> which reduced the extraction efficiency by 50%. This effect was overcome by adding Ca<small><sup>2+</sup></small> (at 10 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) or increasing the iron oxide magnetic particle concentration to 500 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The organic matter also eliminated the co-extraction of Ag<small><sup>+</sup></small>, which would reduce the baseline in the sNP-ICP-MS particleogram thus improving the LOD. Cloud point extraction (CPE) in conjunction with sNP-ICP-MS has been used by Wei <span class="italic">et al.</span> to detect Ag<small><sub>2</sub></small>S NPs in water samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> The CPE procedure involved pH adjustment to 3, the addition of bis(<span class="italic">p</span>-sulfonatophenyl)phenylphosphane dehydrate dipotassium salt, shaking, addition of Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and Triton X-114, incubation at 60 °C, phase separation by centrifugation, collection of the organic phase which was diluted with glycerol and subjected to ultrasound assisted extraction prior to analysis. The extraction efficiency, based on particle number concentration, ranged between 76 to 106% in environmental waters. However, the particle size increased from 77 to 94–97 nm. Nanomaterials are being increasingly used in the oil and gas industry and two methods for extracting Ag NPs spiked into these materials, using a procedure similar to that used in the previous paper were compared by Gajec <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272</span></sup></a> After optimisation, which was fully described in the paper the authors concluded that for water samples centrifugation at 2800 rpm for 12 minutes, gave the best recoveries in terms of particle size and particle concentration whilst for solid wastes the CPE procedure, which is similar to that used in ref. <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271">271</a> was most appropriate for extracting AgNPs spiked into solid waste material. Particle detection was by sNP-ICP-MS.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A report on <span class="italic">the use of FFF-ICP-MS for the detection and quantification of Ag NPs</span> was published this year by Taboada-Lopez <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled with UV-Vis and ICP-MS to quantify Ag NPs in bivalve molluscs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273</span></sup></a> The NPs were extracted from locally purchased clams, oysters and variegated scallops using an enzymatic (pancreatin and lipase) hydrolysis procedure The results obtained showed that the Ag NPs were detected at the same elution time as proteins (UV detection) and the amount of Ag NPs detected ranged between 4% (oyster) and 56% (clam) of the total Ag content as determined by microwave assisted extraction followed by ICP-MS detection. The presence of Ag NPs in the enzymatic extracts was confirmed using SEM.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">One study reported <span class="italic">the use of laser ablation for detecting the signals from Ag NPs</span>. Firstly, Spanu <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LA-ICP-MS for the quantitative determination of the spatial distribution of Ag NPs supported on planar substrates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit274"><sup><span class="sup_ref">274</span></sup></a> Calibration was carried out on a sacrificial sample. The LA-ICP-MS data from this sample were used to define three-dimensional functions describing the spatial distribution of NPs and the volume integrals were calibrated to obtain the mass distribution of Ag NPs, in conjunction with the total Ag mass determined using ICP-MS after an HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> based extraction procedure. An aqueous Ag standard was used to monitor laser fluence and instrumental drift. The method was then applied to a model sample consisting of a low-density polyethylene disk decorated with Ag NPs, and a high spatial resolution over cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>-sized samples was demonstrated.</p>

          <span>Due to use of <span class="italic">TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as an additive in foods and consumer products, and therefore possible implications on human health and the environmental impact</span>, there remains interest in the detection of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs in various sample types. An assessment of the bioaccessibility of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs and Ag NPs from molluscs has recently been undertaken by Taboada-Lopez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit275"><sup><span class="sup_ref">275</span></sup></a> Initially, the presence of NPs in the molluscs was assessed using sNP-ICP-MS, after an enzymatic extraction with pancreatin and lipase. Subsequently, the wet molluscs were homogenised and suspended in an HCl/pepsin mixture at pH 2, to represent the gastric phase, followed by adjustment of the solution pH to 7 and the addition of pancreatin, bile salts and sodium dihydrogen carbonate, to represent the intestinal phase, with each phase shaken at 37 °C for two hours. The bioaccessible fraction ranged from 3 to 89% for TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs and from 7 to 51% for Ag NPs when compared with the total Ti and Ag content, determined after a microwave assisted extraction with HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and ICP-MS. The mollusc samples were also incubated in the presence of Caco-2 cells, as a model for the human epithelium and NP transport into these cells ranged between 17 and 82% and from 2.1 to 22% for TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and Ag NPs, respectively. Triple-quadrupole and high-resolution ICP-MS, operated in sNP mode, have been used to characterise TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in chewing gum, chocolate, cake decorations and a spiked milk sample after extraction into water with ultrasound assisted extraction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276</span></sup></a> The obtained particle size distributions from both instrument types were similar in terms of particle shape and median (123 to 209 nm) and mean (146 to 223 nm) diameters. The results were also in agreement with those from two other techniques, SEM and AF4-MALS-ICP-MS. The use of a milk sample also showed that both ICP-MS instruments were similarly efficient in resolving Ca based interferences on Ti. For the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> powder and two food products, recoveries of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> were greater than 60%. The use of AF4-MALS-ICP-MS for the size characterisation of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs in coffee creamer and instant drink powders was presented by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit277"><sup><span class="sup_ref">277</span></sup></a> The NPs were extracted from the samples using a procedure involving sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), hexane, ultrasound assisted extraction and shaking. The AF4 size calibration was achieved using polystyrene nanospheres and verified using 100 nm TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs. The TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> particle sizes detected ranged from 24–544 nm for coffee creamer and 27.7–574.3 nm for instant drink powders, with detection recoveries of 75% and 92%, respectively. A study by Vidmar <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the levels of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs in waters and sediments at selected sampling sites along the Sava River, a tributary of the Danube, using sNP-TQ-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit278"><sup><span class="sup_ref">278</span></sup></a> Water samples were analysed after sonication and dilution with high purity water whilst NPs in the sediment samples were extracted with 0.1 molar NaCl, sonication and centrifugation followed by dilution. The highest particle mass and particle number concentrations of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs in river waters were from sampling locations impacted by urban, agricultural, and/or industrial activities, suggesting that these NPs are likely of anthropogenic origin whilst the sediment samples all contained a broadly similar amount of the NPs. The Ti<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>Al elemental concentration ratios of NPs in water and sediments at these sites were higher than the natural background ratios, again suggesting an anthropogenic origin.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">It is becoming more common to use both <span class="italic">single cell and single particle ICP-MS to track the evolution and fate of NPs</span> in biological systems. One example of this is the work of Cosmi <span class="italic">et al.</span> who investigated the bio-tribocorrosion of Ti metal and alloys used for dental implants in different biological media, including artificial saliva and in the presence of the mucosal bacterium <span class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit279"><sup><span class="sup_ref">279</span></sup></a> The results revealed lower aggregation when suspending standard TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles at neutral pH in artificial saliva and no additional effect on the agglomeration or particle size due to the presence of bacteria in the media. Subsequently, different Ti-based dental implants made of an alloy of Ti, Al and V were incubated in the presence of artificial saliva for 48 hours to evaluate the <span class="italic">in vitro</span> release of metallic species. The presence of Ti-, Al- and V-containing nanoparticles was observed using sNP-ICP-MS with confirmation by TEM. The addition of mucosal bacteria to the media caused a significant decrease in the production of NPs due to the formation of a biofilm on the surface of the incubated implants. The incubation of the implants released nanoparticles with osteoblast cells (Saos-2 cell culture) and further analysis by single-cell-ICP-MS revealed a significant uptake of the nanostructures by the bone cells with as yet unknown effects.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">detection of Ti by ICP-MS can be hampered by the presence of Ca and P based polyatomic interferences</span>.

          <span>The <span class="italic">quantitative bioimaging of the uptake of quantum dots (QDs) in single cells</span> by LA-ICP-MS was described by Pisonero <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit281"><sup><span class="sup_ref">281</span></sup></a> This task requires a high sensitivity and high spatial resolution and method validation is hampered by the lack of matrix-matched reference materials. The paper reports that high spatially resolved quantitative bioimaging of CdSe/ZnS QDs uptake in single HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells and in single HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells was investigated by combining: (a) ns-LA-ICP-SF-MS; and (b) the spatially resolved analysis of dried pL-droplets from a solution with a known concentration of the QDs to obtain a response factor that allows quantification of elemental bioimages. Single cells and dried pL-droplets were also morphologically characterised by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to determine their volume and thickness distribution. After optimisation of the LA operating conditions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> spot size and energy per laser pulse) the cells and pL droplets were completely ablated at high spatial resolution and constant operating conditions for the analysis of the single cells and calibration samples were used to reduce potential fractionation effects related to mass load effects in the ICP. After incubation in the presence of a QD suspension in a standard cell culture medium the uptake of CdSe/ZnS QDs by the HT22 or HeLa cells was estimated to be between of 3.5 × 10<small><sup>4</sup></small> and 48 × 10<small><sup>4</sup></small>. Mono-elemental bioimaging at subcellular resolution appeared to show a higher number concentration of the CdSe/ZnS QDs in the cytosol around the cell nucleus.</span>

The lowest quantification achieved was 25 copy per μL virus DNA in one analysis without the need for a calibration curve.

Of these, this writer is not aware of any papers describing the measurement of N<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions by ICP-MS and thus the measurements may be practically unfeasible due to the high background levels of N that may be encountered. It is also suggested that MC-ICP-MS should be used, to allow simultaneous signal detection for each virus particle that enters the plasma. This would require a centre detector mass of 20 and a collector mass range of 60% of this value, which is not available on any current instrument. It would be possible to operate the instrument in detector switching mode, whereby C and N signals were measured followed by those of P and S, but it is doubtful that current instrumentation could achieve this at a rate rapid enough to allow the two sets of signals to be determined for one virus particle. It would be interesting to see a report on an attempt to turn the theoretical approach into a practical reality.</p>

      <h2 id="sect2671"><span class="a_heading">5 Forensic analyses</span></h2>
      <span>It is important when analysing forensic samples that they remain as undamaged as possible and that they do not change their nature during analysis. Leaving them in exactly the same state as before the analysis will enable future, improved methods to be used retrospectively. This is obviously not possible if the sample has been destroyed. The use of non-destructive (X-ray based) or minimally destructive (laser-based, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LIBS, LA-ICP-MS) techniques is therefore far more common than acid dissolution followed by nebulization into ICP-MS or OES instruments. The use of chemometric packages on the analytical data to aid classification of materials is a very popular area of research.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect2676"><span class="b_heading">5.1 Glass analysis</span></h3>
        <span>The forensic analysis of glass has proved to be an extremely active area of research during this review period. As with all types of analysis, the use of certified reference materials and/or inter-laboratory studies to evaluate the accuracy is of prime importance. A paper reported by Lambert <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the results obtained from an <span class="italic">inter-laboratory study to evaluate the accuracy of analysis and interpretation of glass evidence</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit334"><sup><span class="sup_ref">334</span></sup></a> The study involved LA-ICP-MS analysis using the standard method ASTM E2927-16e1, where a new calibration material entitled CFGS2 was sent to 10 laboratories. The laboratories were given instructions to follow the ASTM E2927 protocol and to use the reference materials NIST 612, FGS2 or CFGS2 as calibrants. Also sent was the full set of CFGS standards (CFGS1–CFGS3), so that they could be used as test samples (FGS2 was the calibrant under those circumstances). All laboratories also used a calibration verification standard, which was either NIST 1831 or NIST 612. The results of the comparison were treated in two ways: the match criterion specified in ASTM 2927 and the likelihood ratio calculation. Both methods were described in the paper. The likelihood ratio method relied on two databases of glass material composition. These were the Florida International University (FIU) vehicle glass database and the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) database. As expected, glass fragments originating from the same windowpane were indistinguishable, resulting in high likelihood ratio values, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> they had a strong association. Glasses originating from different vehicles could be distinguished, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the likelihood ratio of them being the same was smaller. Glasses originating from different vehicles but from the same manufacturer, year and model were also found to be chemically similar. The agreement between the laboratories was very good, with an RSD value of better than 5% reported. The conclusion, therefore, was that if different laboratories follow the same protocol, they end up with the same results. Although this is hardly a novel revelation, it is obviously a prerequisite for forensic work.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Another paper, by some of the same authors, reported the development of something described as “a new R-based Shiny graphical user interface” to <span class="italic">calculate likelihood ratios for glass discrimination</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit335"><sup><span class="sup_ref">335</span></sup></a> The authors stated how the FIU database was developed, with contributions from LA-ICP-MS as well as solution-based ICP-MS data from the FBI and some input from BKA. The paper explained how the likelihood ratios were calculated using a two-level, multivariate kernel model and calibrated using a Pool Adjacent Violators algorithm. The logarithm of the likelihood ratio was then calculated and compared with the match criterion recommended by the ASTM E2927-16e1 method. The R shiny app and the FIU database were provided in the ESI for researchers to access. A related paper, by Ramos <span class="italic">et al.</span>, described the probabilistic two-level modelling of the within-source and between-source variability that is required for the calculation of likelihood ratios.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit336"><sup><span class="sup_ref">336</span></sup></a> The probabilistic machine learning algorithms used comprised both a variational autoencoder and a warped Gaussian mixture. It was stressed that the model developed had significant advantages over previous models used to calculate likelihood ratios. The main advantage was the significantly improved calibration of the model. The authors did acknowledge that there was also a loss in the discriminating power. A paper by Malmborg and Nordgaard validated a feature-based likelihood ratio method for the SAILR open-source software.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit337"><sup><span class="sup_ref">337</span></sup></a> The validation of the model was achieved using the performance characteristics of accuracy, discrimination and calibration. The paper described the process in full. Although all of the papers described in this paragraph are not advances in atomic spectrometry, they are advances in the way the data from atomic spectrometry may be used.

It is then evaluated with samples of known origin to determine whether or not it classifies them correctly before being used to classify unknown samples. The authors used glass fragments donated by the Israeli police’s forensic department and comprised glasses from various vehicles, including different manufacturers and years of production. The methodology provided a model that had an accuracy of &gt;80% in classifying glass fragment origins. Although this is clearly not perfect, the authors thought it a good start and theorised that it may be useful for other forensic applications including gun shot residue, flammable liquids and illegal substances.</p>

A total of 20 positions were used for the analysis with a raster of 5 × 4 using a separation of 300 μm. Once obtained, the data were input to PCA using the singular value decomposition algorithm. The Mahalanobis distance between the sample point groups in space of the principal components was used as the criterion of discrimination.

The data were normalised to the C signal at 193.1 nm to minimize fluctuations. The samples were split into a 4<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 ratio of the “training set” and the “testing set”. Prior to proceeding with PCA, the data were standardized by subtracting the sample means and then dividing by standard deviations. This placed them on the same scale of measurement. This was necessary to ensure that PCA was not impacted by differing magnitude scales of spectra. Once the data had been treated using PCA, it was reduced to 15 principal components, which were input to LDA. This then achieved a correct classification rate of 98.52% (it made oner error out of 68).

The data for the10 analytes were input to PCA which produced six principal components, accounting for almost 90% of the data. Classification with different manufacturers was partially successful. The incomplete success was attributed to individual fibres having different shapes which can affect the TXRF measurements adversely. Similarly, the position of the fibre on the carrier with respect to the detector can also affect the signals.

Although they do not have subsections of their own, XRF and TOF-SIMS applications were also reviewed.

        <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">comparison of optical techniques and MeV SIMS</span> for the determination of the deposition order between inks which are optically distinguishable (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> a fountain pen and a ballpoint pen or two ballpoint pens of different colour) and indistinguishable inks (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> two ballpoint pens of the same colour) from different writing tools was made by Barac <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit345"><sup><span class="sup_ref">345</span></sup></a> Model examples were prepared by writing on A4 paper, waiting an hour and then writing again using a different pen. The intersections of inks from several writing tools were studied using the standard non-destructive methods such as optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and under IR light. The SIMS instrument employed an 8 MeV Si<small><sup>4+</sup></small> primary beam to produce the secondary ions. A mass spectrum of ink from each writing tool was measured by scanning smaller areas (100 × 100 μm<small><sup>2</sup></small>) of the sample away from the intersection region. Then the intersection region of up to 1400 × 1400 μm<small><sup>2</sup></small> was scanned and 2D molecular map created. The SIMS data were then treated using PCA to highlight the differences in chemical composition between each data point. Since SIMS is effectively a surface analysis technique there should be a distinct change in chemical signature for the ink applied first at the point of intersection of the two inks; whereas this difference would not be present for the ink applied second. If two writing tools of the same colour and from the same manufacturer were used, then distinction could not be made. The SIMS analysis therefore had some advantages over the optical methods because they were far less successful in discriminating the inks. However, the one big drawback of the SIMS is that it is semi-destructive of the sample (small portions of a document must be cut to insert it into the vacuum chamber). It is still possible to use it as a last resort in an attempt to prove forgery though.</p>

They used LIBS to obtain analytical data for Al, C, Ca, Fe, Mg and Si. The chemical composition was similar for all four sample types and so it was difficult to distinguish them directly from the spectrum. Therefore, data mining and analysis were conducted and assisted by machine learning. The data were interrogated using PCA to build a model to represent the sample in the principal component space. Then BP neural network and k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) based on the PCA results were employed to build writing marks identification models. A total of 600 samples were collected from each type of pencil lead, and 100 of them with high SNR were randomly taken for classification using BP neural network. For this, 70% of the data were used as a training set and 30% as test set. The success rate of identifying the pencil mark was 97.9%. The PCA alone was capable of differentiating the four types of pencil, although the separation of the groups was not extremely clear. When combined with KNN a correct identification rate of 98.33% was achieved. Both chemometric methods were therefore extremely good for discrimination purposes and, when combined with a rapid and non-destructive method of analysis such as LIBS, offer an excellent method for forensic scientists.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Analysis of single fibres can be an important forensic application.

Therefore, techniques such as LIBS and ICP-MS that leave craters, typically with μm diameter in a sample, cannot be regarded as being non-destructive. They therefore employed a benchtop TXRF instrument and synchrotron radiation XRF for the analysis. The TXRF instrument was calibrated using wool dyed with a standard chromium mordant. The Cr content had been determined using an acid digestion followed by ICP-MS analysis. The fibres were placed on a glass wafer and then analysed using TXRF employing the Mo-Kα line (17.446 keV) with measurements made at 50 kV and 12 mA. The incident X-rays were formed into 10 mm wide and 5 mm long using slits and irradiated at an angle of 0.05° to the Si wafer surface. Using such a low angle meant that the X-rays penetrated only 3 nm into the wafer, leading to decreased background irradiation from the support. Nitrogen was flowed in front of the detector to decrease signal noise. For the synchrotron radiation XRF, calibration and lower limit of detection calculation was achieved using ERM-EC681k (a low density polyethylene material). Each sample had three fibres analysed and each of these was analysed three times. A total of nine measurements per sample was therefore made. Each measurement took 200 s. Some elements enter the silks through the environment in which the silkworm is living (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ca, Co, Fe and Zn). Other elements <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Cr enter through dying processes. Synchrotron radiation XRF was more sensitive than TXRF. The TXRF had a discrimination success rate of 85.7%. Although very good, it cannot be relied on to provide conclusive evidence. The conclusion therefore was that it was unsuccessful. The synchrotron radiation XRF was more successful (100%), but suffers from the obvious drawbacks of not being portable, requiring specialized facilities and requiring these facilities to be booked ahead of time.</p>

Several other aspects were tested. Included in these was the analysis with and without the organic resin at the core of the solder (placed there to help the melting process). The authors also tested the effect of melting of the solder on the trace metal concentration levels – an obvious but extremely important experiment to undertake since it is vital to know if the concentrations change after use. Once calibrated, the method was validated through the analysis of NIST C2416 bullet lead. Further validation of the method was obtained through a dissolution procedure followed by ICP-MS analysis. It was concluded that the method developed was rapid, accurate, could discriminate between different solders whether it had been melted or not and had the advantage of using only 1.5 mg of sample. It should be noted though, that the precision associated with the analysis was very poor. This is exemplified by the results of the CRM NIST C2416, where the certified value for Sb is 0.79 ± 0.01% and the experimental value obtained was 0.67 ± 0.12%. This could potentially be because of the problems associated with weighing such small samples.</p>

The authors took care to clean the gun between different primers to avoid cross-contamination. Analysis was then undertaken using ICP-MS, LIBS and SEM-EDS. For the ICP-MS analysis, the solutions were first vortex mixed, an aliquot of 100 μL removed and placed in a 50 mL capacity digestion tube, allowed to evaporate for an hour, 100 μL of a mixture of Sc, Y and In added as internal standards followed by 5 mL of 10% nitric acid.

For the non-explosives talcum powder was completely classified correctly, but the flour was successfully classified at 96.67% (with 3.33% mis-classified as HMX) and the PTFE at 96.67% correct (with 3.33% mis-classified as CL-20) were not infallible. When the full data were narrowed down to 13 wavelengths of interest by the ReliefF algorithm (two for CN, two for Ca, two for Na, three for N, two for K, one for O and one for H), the classification success rate improved significantly. All three non-explosives were correctly classified with 100% success, as were CL-20 and HMX. The only slight error was for RDX that was classified correctly 96.67% of the time with 3.33% being mis-classified as CL-20. Another model was then constructed using six regions of the spectrum (for instance the Fe region between 357.55 nm and 358.13 nm). Other regions for H, Na, CN and two for K were also constructed. When these data were inserted into the SVM, classification reached 100% for all materials. Once the method had been developed, it was quick to use and accurate; which is the ideal scenario for real time explosive detectors.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Another example was presented by De Tata <span class="italic">et al.</span> who attempted to determine the source of homemade ammonium nitrate using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, trace elemental analysis using ICP-MS and chemometrics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit356"><sup><span class="sup_ref">356</span></sup></a> Ammonium nitrate is widely used in industry but is also used by terrorists to form bombs. It can be made from combining numerous materials that, on their own pose no threat. A total of nine ammonium nitrate products were obtained, three of which were classed as “pure forms”. Five of the other six were prepared in-house from various readily available materials purchased from hardware shops (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> calcium nitrate and various brands of ammonium sulfate). The last one was prepared from laboratory grade chemicals. For the ICP-MS analysis, ammonium nitrate (200 mg) was dissolved in nitric acid (3 mL) in a 20 mlL capacity polypropylene tube. This was then placed in an oven at 90 °C for 2 hours. Pure water was then added to give a volume of 10 mL before diluting a further 10 or 100-fold. Initially, 57 analytes were determined. However, to aid the statistical analysis, those present as contaminants or present at concentrations below the calibration range of 0.2–50 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were removed from the dataset. This left 10 analytes (B, Ba, Cu, Mn, Ni, Rb, Se, Sr, Ti and U) whose data were mean-centred and then input to PCA. Linear discriminant analysis was then undertaken on the first four principal components. Discriminant models were then generated using a randomised leave-one-out approach. This combined approach was very successful, with repeated LDA identifying the source of every ammonium nitrate sample tested correctly. The ability to use a simple chemical analysis and then using chemometrics to identify whether the source of the explosive is home-made, prepared from pure chemicals or is already available commercially is potentially important for forensic evidence.</p>

      <h2 id="sect2825"><span class="a_heading">6 Cultural heritage</span></h2>
      <span>As always, there has been a great deal of research into the analysis of cultural heritage samples. In common with the forensic analysis of samples, the focus has been on causing minimal sample damage and the use of chemometrics data analysis to glean as much information as possible from the analytical data. Unfortunately, many of the papers in the area of cultural heritage analysis are very routine and so will not be included. Similarly, those papers that focus almost entirely on the archaeology and give very little experimental detail, will also not be reviewed.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Several papers have <span class="italic">reviewed different aspects of the analytical chemistry</span> associated with cultural heritage samples. These will be reviewed in this sub-section of the review. A very brief overview of the use of handheld (portable) XRF for the analysis of archaeological artefacts highlighting the challenges, advantages and limitations was presented by Gherardi.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit357"><sup><span class="sup_ref">357</span></sup></a> The review contained only seven references and was therefore more of a technical note or a perspective than an authoritative review/overview. However, its fast, on-site and non-destructive nature were highlighted and a few interesting applications noted. Another overview was presented by Zhou <span class="italic">et al.</span> who discussed the progress of the application of X-ray spectrometry (both XRF and X-ray absorption fine structure, XAFS) in the non-destructive analysis of relics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit358"><sup><span class="sup_ref">358</span></sup></a> This paper (with 13 references and unfortunately written in Chinese), discussed how obtaining elemental composition and structural information may help conservation and provenance determination.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">An <span class="italic">evaluation of pattern recognition techniques for the attribution of cultural heritage objects based on portable XRF data</span> was presented by Andric <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit359"><sup><span class="sup_ref">359</span></sup></a> A study campaign conducted jointly by scientists, art historians and curators used portable XRF instruments to examine well-preserved and reliably dated icons from four different centuries. A large number of spectra of each were obtained and the data were then treated using an assortment and sometimes a combination of pattern recognition techniques including PCA, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Scattering Matrix-Based Dimension Reduction (SMBDR). These methods managed to reduce the number of dimensions of the datasets. The efficiency of the process was evaluated using the calculated Index of Informativeness and Bhattacharya’s distance. The overall result was that a method was devised that enabled artwork origin to be determined based on PCA data reduction followed by linear classification.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">construction of a low cost, home-made portable EDXRF instrument</span> for use especially for the analysis of cultural heritage samples was described by Ruschioni <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit360"><sup><span class="sup_ref">360</span></sup></a> The geometry was optimized so that sample types that contain large concentrations of low mass analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> glasses and ceramics, as well as those that contain large quantities of medium to high mass analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> metals and alloys could be analysed with good sensitivity and accuracy. The instrument was tested for both qualitative (pigment layers) and quantitative (gold-based certified alloys) analysis. For the pigment layer analysis, the results were comparable to those obtained using a commercial XRF spectrometer, a result the authors were rightly pleased with.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A procedure for the <span class="italic">determination of Pb isotope ratios in archaeological materials using a coupling of liquid chromatography with a multi-collector (MC)-ICP-MS instrument</span> was presented by Penanes <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit361"><sup><span class="sup_ref">361</span></sup></a> The determination of Pb isotopes can be useful because they may give pointers as to the geographical origin of the material. After dissolution, the Pb was separated from concomitant ions using EDTA chelates on an anion exchange column and a mobile phase of ammonium nitrate. A flow injection system was used to introduce a spike of NIST 981, a Pb isotopic standard, before and after the Pb peak from the sample for “bracketing” purposes. Thallium was introduced for mass bias correction. The method was validated in two ways. The first was by injecting NIST 981 as the sample and passing it through the chromatographic system. The other was to compare the results obtained for real samples with those obtained using a conventional off-line separation procedure using the commercial Pb-Spec resin. Once optimized, the procedure was applied to the analysis of archaeological samples with varying Pb concentrations. No preconcentration procedure was attempted and so the method was limited to those samples with a Pb content in excess of 500 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">LIBS characterization of a range of materials (metal artefacts, bones, potsherds and coloured glazed pottery) found at a military settlement</span> in the Argentinian Pampas was reported by Pace <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit362"><sup><span class="sup_ref">362</span></sup></a> The samples were damaged slightly by using the LIBS laser to drill though corrosion layers and superficial weathering to expose the underlying bulk composition of the material. This was done to assist in the identification of the pigments in the paints and to analyse the glazing process. Discrimination between analytes in the pigments, the binder medium and from the paste matrix was achieved. The outermost varnish layer was removed to ensure contamination from the earth it had been buried in did not contribute any elemental signatures. The primer layer was white lead Pb(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·2PbCO<small><sub>3</sub></small> A pink painted layer was found to contain Pb and Sn. The authors hypothesised that this was a mixture of red lead (Pb<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>(2PbO·PbO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)) with lead–tin yellow (Pb<small><sub>2</sub></small>SnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>). The results of the analyses provided useful information on the characteristics, raw materials, manufacturing processes, use and provenance of the objects. For instance, it was concluded that the lead bullets and the iron-rich alloys were probably prepared locally, from locally sourced materials, whereas the porcelains were probably of European origin.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Two papers have discussed the <span class="italic">LIBS analysis of archaeological mortars and/or construction materials</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit363"><sup><span class="sup_ref">363,364</span></sup></a> The paper by Richiero <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the analysis of lime mortars, a class of mortars used from the Roman empire through to the industrial revolution. The recipes used varied between geographical area, the historical period, the craftsmen making it and its use. Three lime mortars from different geographical areas (Angers, France; Dardilly, France and Pompeii) and having different uses (a cathedral, an aqueduct and a house, respectively) were studied using a μ-LIBS instrument. This enabled the compilation of an elemental image for each of the mortars. The LIBS instrument consisted of a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, a pulse duration of 8 ns, a pulse energy of 700 μJ and a repetition rate of 100 Hz. The result was a crater in the sample of ∼8 μm in diameter. The emitted light was detected using fibre optics attached to three different spectrometers covering three spectral ranges and with CCD as detectors. It was possible to determine the chemical signature of each of the mortars because using the three spectrometers over 25 analytes could be determined. The nature of the aggregates were determined in terms of elucidating the granulometry (the size and shape of the particles) and circularity (a parameter measuring how closely the shape of an object approaches that of a perfect circle). The circularity provides information on whether the material is alluvial or colluvial. The use of masks helped simplify the image processing. The methodology for the masks was given in the paper and ESI. The advantage of using LIBS was that it could detect the light elements with good sensitivity – something that many XRF spectrometers cannot achieve. Its speed of analysis and ability to map large areas were also identified as advantages. The other paper to use LIBS for the analysis of archaeological construction materials was presented by Zivkovic <span class="italic">et al.</span> who applied it to form elemental maps of materials from the foundations of the Smederevo Fortress in Serbia.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit363"><sup><span class="sup_ref">363</span></sup></a> The LIBS instrument employed a double pulse Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and a spectrometer equipped with a CCD. Coupling this instrument with a commercial microscope enabled the elemental mapping with resolution at the micro-scale which, given the inhomogeneous nature of the sample, was more than sufficient. The combined use of the calibration-free analysis and the inputting of data to an unsupervised clustering algorithm enabled a good discrimination between different materials to be obtained. Both papers commented on the potential of LIBS in the future for this type of work.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Shen and Shen reported the use of a <span class="italic">portable combined XRD-XRF instrument</span> capable of being taken into the field.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit365"><sup><span class="sup_ref">365</span></sup></a> The instrument was used to identify cinnabar (alpha-mercury sulfide) in assorted material types including raw materials, polished gemstones and Chinese ink sticks. The novelty in this paper is obviously the portable nature of the instrument because XRD is normally very much a laboratory-based technique. A comparison of the results obtained using the portable instrument with those obtained using a conventional laboratory-based XRD instrument and a μ-Raman spectroscopy method was made. The XRD results were in reasonable agreement. Meanwhile, the XRF component of the instrument was used to qualitatively identify the elements present so that the range of possible phases could be defined. The XRF detector was reportedly sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between the cinnabar and another red pigment (Pb<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>) without causing damage to the sample. The conclusion was that the portable instrument when used in conjunction with the Raman system presents researchers with a convenient and rapid method of identifying minerals and that its use could cover research fields including mineralogy, cultural heritage, materials science, <span class="italic">etc.</span></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Numerous other applications more specific to sample types were also reported. These will be discussed in the individual sections below, often with the assistance of tables for easy reference for the reader.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect2873"><span class="b_heading">6.1 Metallic artefacts</span></h3>
        <span>Steenstra <span class="italic">et al.</span> have described the analysis of <span class="italic">the cultural heritage alloy reference materials (CHARM) set of Cu-alloys</span> using excimer ns LA-ICP-MS and assessed the matrix effects and its applicability to artefact provenancing.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit366"><sup><span class="sup_ref">366</span></sup></a> The extent of the matrix effects was very variable between different alloys. This was attributed to the variation in the Zn/Cu ratio, with those samples rich in Zn significantly affecting the melting and boiling points (and hence, laser ablation properties). This makes those samples with higher concentrations of Zn more prone to matrix effects. Using 32XLB14F, a Pb-rich CHARM reference material and internal standardization enabled results of good accuracy (better than 20% error) to be achieved for virtually all the brass and bronze materials studied. This represented a significant improvement compared with using silicate glasses as an external reference material. This highlights, once again, that the certified materials to use for calibration should be as closely matched as possible to the sample types. Clearly, an alloy is closer in matrix composition than glass to alloys and serves its purpose better.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The viability of obtaining <span class="italic">quantitative analytical data using XRF on (a) a corroded surface, (b) a stripped patina area and (c) polished cross sections of 25 archaeological copper alloys</span> from Iran was assessed by Holakooei <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit367"><sup><span class="sup_ref">367</span></sup></a> The LOD, LOQ, precision and accuracy of the analytical data were assessed using 12 CRMs. In addition, the same samples were also analysed using ICP-OES and the data from the two techniques compared statistically. The corroded surfaces were depleted in Ni and Zn and enriched in As, Pb and Sn. This means that the XRF could potentially give mis-leading results if conclusions for the bulk of the sample are assumed from the surface analysis. However, it was thought that the areas with the lowest Sn concentration were probably the best representation of the composition of As, Cu, Pb and Zn in ancient copper alloys. The quantitative data obtained from the stripped patina and from the polished cross-sections for the two analytical techniques were comparable, leading the authors to conclude that the μ-XRF technique could be used with confidence to obtaining accurate results.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting paper that tackled the problem of <span class="italic">obtaining sufficient material for accurate Pb isotope ratio measurements</span> was presented by Merkel <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit368"><sup><span class="sup_ref">368</span></sup></a> A portable LA system was utilised that employed a pulsed diode pumped solid state laser operating at 532 nm and with a pulse duration of &lt;1 ns. Repetition rate could be varied between 1 and 10<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 Hz, but a value of 100 was used. The laser beam was focussed using lenses to a fibre optic and the resulting beam was 100 μm in diameter. Ablated sample (obtained after ∼9000 pulses) was retained on a pre-cleaned Teflon filter <span class="italic">via</span> a vacuum pump. The material on the filter was then dissolved using 7 M nitric acid (1.5 mL) assisted by sonication. After matrix removal and Pb enrichment, the samples were ready for analysis using MC-ICP-MS with a standard sample bracketing method. The material NIST 981 was used for quality control purposes. Approximately 1 μg of Pb was collected per filter which was significantly higher than the blank values (20 pg). The methodology was applied to the analysis of silver objects and to nine reference materials: one commercial (MBH 133X-AGA3, batch A), six produced in-house and the final two being archaeological materials used for inter-laboratory studies. The precision of the method was approximately five times better than ns LA-MC-ICP-MS used <span class="italic">in situ</span>. The method obviously does not require the transport of precious artefacts away from the museum and could open up the possibility of enabling a large number of unanalysed samples to be studied.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">determination of gilding thickness using EDXRF</span> has been studied previously and usually requires the use of different energies of the X-rays and measurement of the fluorescence K<small><sub>α</sub></small> or K<small><sub>β</sub></small>, L<small><sub>α</sub></small> or L<small><sub>β</sub></small> ratios using any of three models. These three models are: the self-attenuation method in which Au-Lα/Au-Lβ, varies with gold thickness, the ratio of X-ray intensity method in which Kα/a-Kβ (or a-Lα/a-Lβ), which varies with gold thickness and only depends on the different attenuation by gold of the two and finally, the Au-Lα/a-Kα (or Au-Lα/a-Lα), which also varies according to the gold thickness. A paper by Cesareo <span class="italic">et al.</span> tested these models to determine their limits, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> how thin or thick the layers can be before problems arise.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit369"><sup><span class="sup_ref">369</span></sup></a> Three scenarios were studied using various artefacts. One scenario was gilded lead, the second was gilded copper and the third was gilded silver. For the first scenario, a painting by Raphael and the state coach of Dom Pedro II were studied. For the second scenario, three crowns and a pendant from the tomb of the Lady of Cao (dated 350 AD) were studied and for the third scenario, a vase from the Chavin civilization from North Peru (dated several hundred years BCE) was studied. For the gold self-attenuation model, the useful layer thickness was 2–8 μm. For the attenuation by gold of the X-rays of an internal element the useful thickness was ∼1 μm and for the gold to internal element X-ray ratio, the useful thickness layers ranged from 0.05 to 10 μm approximately, depending on the internal element. Therefore, for layers with thin gilding (as in these samples that have layers of &lt;1 μm), the first two models are of no use and the third model is the only one capable of providing reliable data.</p>

        <span>
          <span class="italic">Three reviews directly applicable to this sub-section</span> were produced. This included one by Burgio entitled “Pigments, dyes and inks: their analysis on manuscripts, scrolls and papyri”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit377"><sup><span class="sup_ref">377</span></sup></a> This review contained 159 references and discussed the potential methods that could be used, with the methods being grouped according to their invasiveness/destructiveness. The review was aimed at scientists, curators, students, conservators and practitioners. It was a well-written review and would be of great interest to people in the subject area. The second review was by Cappa and Sterflinger and overviewed the non-invasive physico-chemical and biological analysis of parchment manuscripts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit378"><sup><span class="sup_ref">378</span></sup></a> This overview had 49 references and concentrated on XRF elemental analysis and compound specific techniques such as FTIR and Raman. Also discussed were the DNA analysis techniques to identify the biological origin of the materials. The latter could also help identify any viruses, micro-organisms and insects that may be present. The third review, by Bouvier <span class="italic">et al.</span> contained 134 references and focussed on the TOF-SIMS analysis of old paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit379"><sup><span class="sup_ref">379</span></sup></a> The method is capable of determining the organic composition by detecting the molecular ions and fragments of binders as well as the mineral contents of most of the pigments. The technique is almost non-destructive and has a lateral resolution of less than 1 μm. The review was conveniently split into sections discussing primary beams, the mass analysers, imaging, matrix effects and a series of applications.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">As discussed previously, the analysis of any cultural heritage samples should cause minimal damage. A paper by Muller <span class="italic">et al.</span> identified <span class="italic">invisible modifications under the surface of painted parchments induced by proton beam irradiation from techniques such as PIGE, PIXE and RBS</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit380"><sup><span class="sup_ref">380</span></sup></a> These techniques are generally regarded as being non-destructive and so studies finding that they induce changes are important. Various modifications were observed in the cross-section of the parchment after irradiation. These included: discoloration (yellowing), the formation of cavities and the denaturation of collagen fibres. Damage was noted to a depth of 100 μm for a beam fluence of 4 μC cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and higher. Interestingly, the presence of the blue paint ultramarine on the parchment surface appeared to exacerbate the problem. Based on experimental data, the authors recommended a maximum fluence of 0.5 μC cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> for 2.3 MeV PIXE analysis.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another paper to discuss damage inflicted on paintings during analysis was presented by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit381"><sup><span class="sup_ref">381</span></sup></a> In this example the <span class="italic">damage inflicted by synchrotron radiation on ancient paintings</span> was examined using ED-XAS and IR. The effects of synchrotron radiation on pure rabbit skin glue, and a mixed sample of rabbit skin glue and zinc white were investigated. The effects of low energy X-rays (7775 eV) were more severe on the rabbit skin glue whereas for the mixed sample the effects of the radiation were exacerbated by the presence of the inorganic pigment. This was attributed to the pigment absorbing more of the radiation. The damage was worst when energy close to the Zn K-edge was used. The damage manifested itself in the secondary structure of proteins. The damage caused started rapidly and then slowed and therefore did not increase in proportion to the irradiation time. The authors recommended that synchrotron radiation induced damage can be minimized if the X-ray energy used is far away from the X-ray absorption edge of all of the main elements in the pigments. This would affect techniques such as XRF and XRD. As an alternative, time-resolved techniques such as QXAFS or ED-XAS during XAFS experiments would also reduce the effects.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Macro-XRF has become a frequently used tool for the analysis of paintings because it is non-invasive, rapid, can cover relatively large areas quickly and can provide useful information on the chemical makeup of paints and can reveal images underneath the painting. A paper by Yan <span class="italic">et al.</span> described <span class="italic">an automatic algorithm that was capable of extracting and identifying elements and their distribution from macro-XRF datasets</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit382"><sup><span class="sup_ref">382</span></sup></a> The algorithm was described in full in the paper, but it was essentially comprised of three parts: pre-processing steps, pulse detection and model order selection based on Finite Ratio of Innovation theory and finally chemical element estimation based on Cramer–Rao bounding techniques. The performance of the algorithm was assessed through the processing of macro-XRF datasets obtained from the analysis of paintings from the National Gallery, London. The algorithm proved very successful, having the ability to identify weak signals from noisy XRF spectra, separate overlapping chemical signals and, in the case of a Leonardo da Vinci painting, observing a hidden under-drawing below a masterpiece.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An instrument of quite poor resolution (18% at full width at half maximum at 5.9 keV) was used by Lach <span class="italic">et al.</span> to provide <span class="italic">XRF spectra of historical paintings that were subsequently processed using factorisation methods</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit383"><sup><span class="sup_ref">383</span></sup></a> The design of the full field imaging instrument was described in full in the paper. It employed a position-sensitive and energy dispersive gas electron multiplier detector. The gas electron multiplier detector has several advantages. These include having a large area that can be manufactured easily at low cost. They do not require cooling and can be operated at room temperature. Since they have such a large area, they are ideal for performing macro-XRF, which has a primary use for the analysis of flat areas, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> paintings. Three factorisation methods of the data were evaluated: region of interest, non-negative matrix factorisation and PCA. The paper explained how each method worked and applied them to the datasets obtained from two paintings. Both PCA and non-negative matrix factorisation enhanced the selectivity of the elements determined using the poor resolution spectrometer. This demonstrates the power of the chemometric tools.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper attempting to <span class="italic">elucidate the cause and mechanism of the darkening of “fake-gilded” decorations in a painting</span> was presented by Monico <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used several synchrotron X-ray-based techniques for the task.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit384"><sup><span class="sup_ref">384</span></sup></a> The painting unusually consisted of a mixture of the pigment orpiment (As<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>3</sub></small>) and metallic silver and so these materials were the main focus during this study. The paper described a multi-material and multi-method approach based on the combination of synchrotron radiation X-ray-based techniques such as XRD, XRF and XANES and vibrational micro-spectroscopy methods. The high specificity, sensitivity and lateral resolution of the techniques provided evidence of the presence of black acanthite (alpha-Ag<small><sub>2</sub></small>S), mimetite (Pb<small><sub>5</sub></small>(AsO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>Cl) and syngenite (K<small><sub>2</sub></small>Ca(SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) as degradation products. It was also proved that the metallic Ag and moisture were the key factors in transforming As<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>3</sub></small> into alpha-Ag<small><sub>2</sub></small>S and arsenic oxides and that sulfide ions arising from the degradation of As<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>3</sub></small> were responsible for the formation of alpha-Ag<small><sub>2</sub></small>S.It was also demonstrated that exposure to light exacerbated the processes. The evidence provided by atomic spectrometry therefore allowed the authors to construct a degradation mechanism. Although the analysis was applied to only one painting, the approach could be used for others and potentially, other sample types.</p>

        <h3 id="sect3209"><span class="b_heading">6.4 Glass materials</span></h3>
        <span>This area has seen an increase in activity during this review period. Again, the focus was <span class="italic">on non- or minimally destructive analysis</span>. This was highlighted in two papers by Oujja <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used a variety of techniques including LIBS, LIF, non-linear optical microscopy and multi-photon excitation fluorescence to analyse historical glass Grisailles<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit406"><sup><span class="sup_ref">406</span></sup></a> and medieval-like glass alteration layers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit407"><sup><span class="sup_ref">407</span></sup></a> Both papers managed to analyse layers and the depth of these layers causing no damage in most cases and minimal damage in the case of LIBS. In the latter case, the thickness of the layers determined using multi-phase excitation fluorescence microscopy were compared and were in agreement with thickness determined using SEM-EDS and optical microscopy.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">comparison of minimally invasive ICP-MS approaches to <small><sup>87</sup></small>Sr/<small><sup>86</sup></small>Sr isotope analysis of medieval stained glass known to have elevated Rb and REE levels</span> was conducted by van Ham-Meert <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit408"><sup><span class="sup_ref">408</span></sup></a> The techniques used were: an acid dissolution followed by chromatographic analyte isolation and pneumatic nebulization into a MC-ICP-MS instrument; LA-MC-ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS/MS using CHF<small><sub>3</sub></small>/He as the reaction gas. The LA-MC-ICP-MS method was unsuccessful in that the high Rb/Sr and the presence of REE at elevated concentration led to a large bias which could not be corrected for using a higher resolution setting or by using mathematical correction algorithms. The LA-ICP-MS/MS method was more successful, with the Sr signal monitored at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 86, 87 and 88 as well as the F adducts at 105, 106 and 107. This successfully overcame interferences arising from the Rb and the doubly charged REE. Unsurprisingly, the precision obtained (0.3% RSD) was worse using this sequential quadrupole-based instrument than using a MC-based one (0.03% RSD). However, the results were still in reasonable agreement with those obtained using the digestion, chromatographic separation and pneumatic nebulization MC-ICP-MS method. The latter method took significantly longer and was more damaging than the LA-based method. It would therefore seem that the protracted dissolution method followed by MC-ICP-MS that causes more damage to the sample is still the best way of obtaining precise isotope ratio data although the rapid LA-ICP-MS/MS method is a viable alternative.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Back reflection-enhanced LIBS analysis was conducted on archaeological glasses</span> by Abdel-Harith <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit409"><sup><span class="sup_ref">409</span></sup></a> A highly polished metal reflector (copper or silver) in direct contact with the underside of the sample reflects the laser beam back through the sample and the plasma it had created from the sample. As it passes through, it reheats the plasma increasing the intensity of the light emitted from it, the result is that the signal to noise ratio of the analytes improves significantly compared with analysis without the reflector. In a way, it is similar to double pulse LIBS, but with the advantage of using only one pulse, not requiring instrumentation for gate delays or a second laser, <span class="italic">etc.</span> The only drawback is that the sample type must be transparent. Therefore glasses, in this case archaeological glasses from Egyptian Synagogue windows, were the ideal sample type. Signal enhancements were between three and four-fold and this was dependent on the colour of the glass and its thickness. Comparison of data with those obtained using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy found they were in excellent agreement. The authors hoped that their methodology could also be used for other transparent sample types, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> gemstones and polymers.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">It is well known that LA-ICP-MS is a rapid way of obtaining data causing minimal damage to the sample. However, it suffers the drawback of requiring a large number of data processing steps for the results to be coherent. These steps include: data segmentation, background correction, calibration and normalisation. Faltusova <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a <span class="italic">standalone processing software that allows easy and straightforward processing of data for bulk analysis and imaging</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit410"><sup><span class="sup_ref">410</span></sup></a> The software, written in Python and named Ilaps, was built around the free and open-source Python package called imgMS. This simplified the customization of the used functions. The combination of imgMS and a stand-alone graphical software made it possible for researchers with no programming knowledge to use it. The software package Ilaps required no data preparation and can process bulk analysis data or convert data into an image in minutes. The software can automatically select the signals that are representative of the sample, but is sufficiently flexible also to allow manual removal of data, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> to exclude contaminants. The software was applied successfully to the bulk analysis of archaeological glasses and to the imaging of a mouse brain.</p>
