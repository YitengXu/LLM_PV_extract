It follows on from last year's review<small><sup>1</sup></small> and should be read in conjunction with other reviews in the series.<small><sup>2–6</sup></small> This year has seen the departure of Malcolm Salisbury, one of the writing team for two years. He has, however, been replaced by Sian Shore who is an able successor. Our thanks go to Malcolm for all of his hard work over the period.</span></p><p><span class="italic">This year's review has a slightly changed format, with the larger sections being split into smaller sub-sections so that the reader may be directed more easily to the parts of the review most relevant to them. In addition, to aid quick reference, the use of Tables has also continued.</span></p><p><span class="italic">The technique of laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) is still gathering pace, and its use is expanding into new territory. Similarly, the use of femtosecond laser ablation is also receiving more interest. These laser-based techniques are invaluable tools for the analysis of materials that are very inert, refractory or otherwise difficult to bring into solution or indeed if they are valuable either in terms of monetary value or archaeologically and must therefore have as little damage inflicted on them as possible. The use of chemometric analysis of analytical data is also gaining in popularity, especially for archaeological materials such as pottery/ceramics and glasses. This is largely because the use of chemometrics may facilitate provenance studies, elucidate trade routes etc. In addition, it is also being used increasingly for forensic applications.</span></p><p><span class="italic">There is a continuing trend for the subject areas to overlap slightly, and hence it is worth noting that some papers may be discussed in more than one section of the review and that other papers may only be discussed once, but possibly not in the most expected place.</span></p><p><span class="italic">The writing team are keen to elicit feedback from readers of this review and invite you to complete the Atomic Spectroscopy Updates questionnaire on http://www.asureviews.org/.</span></p></div><hr/><span>There have been a number of reviews of techniques that are very relevant to this the analysis of materials described in this review. For instance, Pasquini and co-workers have described the use, applications, fundamentals as well as some possible future trends of LIBS analyses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> The use of such a technique enables “stand-off” analysis and has therefore found numerous applications in areas that may otherwise provide an unpleasant or dangerous working environment. The authors also highlight the use of chemometric analysis of the data produced, to maximize the information that is obtained. Another review of direct relevance has been produced by Fernandez <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> who discussed the use of femtosecond laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (fs-LA-ICP-MS). The authors discuss the advantages of the technique, including the marked decrease in elemental fractionation obtained during the transient signal when compared with LA signals produced by longer duration laser pulses as well as the improved figures of merit and the improved spatial resolution. The review summarized the differences between ablation mechanisms caused by short (&gt; 1 ps) and ultra-short (&lt; 1 ps) laser pulses and also presented a review of applications that covered aspects of depth-profiling as well as elemental analysis of assorted material types including biological, geological and other industrial-related materials.</span><h2 id="sect407"><span class="a_heading">1 Metals</span></h2><span>For all types of metals and alloys, the most interesting contributions continue to centre on solid sample analysis methods. Laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS), in particular, continues to be of interest (16% of abstracts). The overall distribution of abstracts reviewed for the metals section by instrumental method were: atomic absorption 3%, atomic emission 30%, mass spectrometry 17%, atomic fluorescence 1%, SIMS 4%, XRF 18%, and the use of multiple instrumental methods 27%. Abstracts that are fundamental in nature were not cited and instead, readers are referred to instrumental reviews.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2,3</span></sup></a></span><h3 id="sect412"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Ferrous metals and alloys</span></h3><span>A low cost LIBS system was described by Gonzaga and Pasquini<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> for the determination of Mn in steel. A partial least squares calibration model was used and accuracies of 0.3–7.3% relative to ICP-OES determinations were reported. The authors concluded that the performance of low cost systems can be very good for specific applications and that the use of chemometrics and integration of analysis pulses can partially compensate for low resolution and lower sensitivity compared with more expensive spectrometers. An online LIBS system was introduced at a continuous casting operation for high nickel steel by Aimoto <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> It was possible to detect alumina inclusions, casting mould contamination (from Al, Ca, Mg, Si, Na) and slag contamination on the surface (from Al, Ca, Mg). The analysis time, including sample preparation, was reported to be within 30 minutes. Elemental mapping of C, S and Si on segregated slabs was also shown. LIBS was used for the analysis of steel-making slags as reported by Palagas <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> Samples were crushed and milled to less than 0.2 mm and presented to the spectrometer as a solidified sample. Accuracy as measured by regression coefficients for iron oxides in two types of furnaces was reported to be very good (0.93 and 0.95). The regression coefficients for MgO and SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> were 0.94 and 0.86. Other components had much poorer regression coefficients because of the greater amount of scatter observed.</span><p class="otherpara">Coedo and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> used fused glass beads with fixed iron content and varying concentration of Al and Ti as calibration standards for the determination of these elements in steel reference materials by laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS). Iron (<span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 57) was used as an internal standard and the concentrations found were in agreement with certified values. It was reported that it was possible to distinguish between soluble and total analyte concentrations. Iron isotope ratios were measured by multi-collector ICP-MS with H<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a collision cell gas to remove polyatomic interferences in work published by Zhou, and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> Ten synthetic standards were prepared by blending 99.94% Fe-56 and 99.90% Fe-54. The precision of the ten correction factors was 0.044% which indicated good linearity of the method for different abundance ratios.</p><p class="otherpara">Electrolysis dissolution cells connected to ICP-OES were used by Aimoto and co-workers to determine elements in steels<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> (in Japanese). P was rapidly determined in steel samples by generating PH<small><sub>3</sub></small> in a heated electrolytic dissolution cell connected to the nebulizer of an ICP-OES instrument. It was noted that heating the cell to 80°C increased PH<small><sub>3</sub></small> gas generation markedly and the analytical results were in agreement with a spectrophotometric method. In another report by the same group,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> Si was determined in steel by flow injection through an electrolysis cell to the ICP-OES instrument. A solution of 6 M HCl was introduced at a flow of 5 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the electrolysis cell operated at a constant 1.5 A at 25°C to avoid precipitation of the hydrolysed Si on its way through to the nebulizer. Results were in agreement with those obtained using a gravimetric method.</p><p class="otherpara">As noted at the beginning of this section, there are a large number of published papers in which multiple techniques are used to study metal-based systems. The performance of instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) was compared with other spectrometric methods for the analysis of stainless steel by Cincu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> The results from proficiency test samples from 5 different laboratories were compared. The corrosion-electrochemical behaviour of 13% chromium martensitic stainless steel in HCl solutions of different concentration was examined by Chermat-Aourasse and Kesri.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> Sample surfaces, after treatment, were examined by SEM coupled with EDAX. Flame AAS and colorimetric methods were used to analyze the corrosion products. In general, corrosion was observed from exposure to all the HCl solutions. The authors claimed that this is because of the composition and the microstructural properties of the alloys. Charleton and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> demonstrated that a low power electro-corrosion device could be used for rapid metal sample preparation. Steel, brass, and aluminium samples were prepared and analyzed by GFAAS, FAAS, and ICP-MS. Trace elements (&lt;1%) could be observed but not quantified whereas major and minor components could be quantified.</p><p class="otherpara">The surface composition of Fe–Ni thin films was determined by different methods and compared by Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> X-ray photoemission spectrometry (XPS) and Auger electron spectrometry used sensitivity factors calculated from the pure metals to assess concentration values that were within 2% of the certified concentrations (obtained using ICP-MS). Analysis using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) with a C-60 ion source obtained values within 4%.</p><p class="otherpara">Mizukami <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> studied the collapse of inclusions on the surface of steel samples that occur during the measurement process of spark OES pulse height distribution analysis (PDA). The techniques of SEM-EDS, EPMA and spark OES were used for the analysis. Inclusions initially generate an asymmetric distribution. It was found that inclusions were destroyed by the spark process and dispersed as fine particles into the metal matrix. The emission intensities from the fine particles generated by this process are superimposed on the normal symmetric emissions from soluble elements in the matrix. The authors proposed that finely dispersed particles generated from inclusions contribute to the symmetric normal distribution of a PDA histogram.</p><p class="otherpara">Koshelev <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> studied the chromium oxide growth on a Fe–Cr–Ni alloy with grazing emission XRF (GEXRF) spectrometry. Oxide thickness, Cr depletion zone in the substrate, and concentration of Fe and Ni in the oxide layer were monitored by GEXRF. SEM and Raman spectrometry were also used to independently study this system. Many properties of Zr–Mg cobalt ferrite were studied by a variety of methods, as described by Iqbal and Siddiquah.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> The composition was measured by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry and the crystal cell structure was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The minimum temperature for synthesis was elucidated by thermogravimetric analysis.</p><h3 id="sect449"><span class="b_heading">1.2 Non-ferrous metals and alloys</span></h3><span>The detection of biological contamination on copper and painted surfaces by LIBS was reported by Merdes <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> Chemometric data analysis consisting of many tests gave a classification tool that was able to identify bacterial spores with a false positive rate of 1% and a false negative rate of 3%. Mohamed<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> developed a portable echelle-based LIBS system that was used to determine Be, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and Si in aluminium standard alloys. Linear calibration curves were obtained with regression coefficients of 98–99%. Limit of detection values were in the ppm range and good precision was claimed (3–8% RSD) but it was not stated at what element concentrations. LIBS was heralded as a new analytical technique for <span class="italic">in-situ</span> studies of artwork in a paper by Detalle <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> (in French). The advantages of no sample preparation, qualitative identification of elements, and <span class="italic">in-situ</span> application were cited. Examples presented were alloy identification, depth-profiling and pigment analysis in painted objects. The application of LIBS to forensic investigations was discussed in a paper by Martin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> Proof of concept examples, such as elemental composition determination in prosthetic implants and analysis of human remains, were presented. Ramli <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> quantitatively determined hydrogen in zircaloy-4 by LIBS in an ultrapure helium gas environment. A linear calibration curve was obtained from zircaloy-4 samples and a limit of detection was estimated to be 50 ppm. The authors claimed this demonstrated the potential of the technique for <span class="italic">in-situ</span> quantitation of hydrogen impurities in zircaloy-4 tubes used in nuclear power plants.</span><p class="otherpara">Sieber, <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> described an XRF method for the determination of silicon metal and included impurities. A fused glass sample was made by reaction of the sample with LiOH to form Li<small><sub>2</sub></small>SiO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and followed by fluxing with lithium borate. Matrix matched calibration standards were made for calibration. Concentrations of nine impurity elements obtained using XRF were very similar to those obtained using ICP-OES and gamma-ray activation analysis. Results were validated by comparison to silicon metal reference materials. Cesareo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> used a 50 eurocent coin to develop a protocol to evaluate the performance of mobile XRF spectrometers for the analysis of archaeological and historic materials. The coin material is 89% Cu, 5% Al, 5% Zn and 1% Sn and is widely available. A number of different mobile spectrometers with different configurations were examined. Limits of detection were observed to vary by a factor of 6 for Zn and 100 for Sn. X-ray tube voltage was observed to be the most important parameter that affected spectrometer performance. The limitations of applying portable XRF to the analysis of multilayer objects and bronze artefacts were discussed in a paper by Gianoncelli and Kourousias.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> The authors discussed the strengths, weaknesses and underlying assumptions of using portable XRF spectrometers to analyze archaeological materials.</p><p class="otherpara">The determination of O in magnesium by glow discharge- mass spectrometry (GD-MS) was discussed in a report from Kikuta and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> using only relative sensitivity factors. It was found that a pre-discharge time of 5000s was required to remove surface adsorbed oxygen for both pin and disk shaped samples. The O concentration in pure magnesium and re-dissolved magnesium was quantified by GD-MS and charged particle activation analysis. Based on the comparison, the GD-MS was recommended as a possible technique to measure O with high sensitivity.</p><p class="otherpara">The origins of 240 Roman lead objects found in archaeological sites in Germany were investigated by Durali-Mueller <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> using multi-collector ICP-MS isotope analysis. Lead isotope ratios of ore bodies in Germany were correlated with the isotope ratios of the lead objects. One ore body in Germany (Eifel, Hunsrueck) was the source of 85% of the objects tested. Historic silverpoint drawings were studied by Reiche and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> by spatially resolved synchrotron induced XRF which has sufficient sensitivity for both major and minor components. It was concluded that three of the five drawings were found to have been drawn by the same silverpoint because of the similarity in element composition observed.</p><p class="otherpara">A micro-analytical study of welding aerosols using a combination of EDXRF, micro-Raman spectroscopy and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) was conducted by Worobiec <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> The study showed inter-dependency between the particles' composition and the particles' size and structure. This is consistent with previously assumed formation mechanisms. Souza and co-workers studied solid state reactions in the platinum-mercury system by thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, EDXRF, SEM, ICP-OES, XRD and cold vapour AAS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> The results indicated that electro-deposited Hg reacts with Pt to form a variety of intermetallic compounds even after the partial removal of bulk mercury from the surface by thermal desorption. The chlorination of aluminium-copper alloys at temperatures of 200–500°C was investigated by thermogravimetry, XRD, SEM, and EDXRF. De Micco, and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> observed that reactivity of the alloys differed from the pure elements and that there were interactions between the different chlorides formed in the process.</p><p class="otherpara">There were two papers that dealt with the analysis of patinas by a variety of techniques. Mathis and Aucouturier<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> used non-destructive techniques such as particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE), Rutherford back-scattering spectrometry (RBS), XRD and Raman spectroscopy to examine patinas on copper based alloys. In another paper, ICP-MS and ICP-OES were used to provide quantitative information on patinas formed on Chinese bronzes. The authors, Hou <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> also used XRD, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy to understand the structure and compounds forming the patinas.</p><p class="otherpara">Porticello bronzes were studied using LIBS and portable XRF methods in a paper by Ferretti <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> These techniques provided <span class="italic">in-situ</span> analysis of several bronze pieces at an offshore find.

Emissions, particulates, and residues (fly ash) related to coal combustion were present in a large number of papers. Laser ablation combined with ICP-MS has been generating increased interest. There has also been interest in further developing methods for determining low level S in fuel. Far lower detection limits than current legislation requires have been achieved, using technology that has been optimized for this requirement. Several papers proposed methods for the determination of Cu, Fe and V in petroleum products. Established analysis techniques were used, but with novel sample preparation procedures. Relatively few papers have been published about wear metal analysis of lubricating oils during this review period. This is in contrast to 2007 when there was increased interest in this area.

The LOD obtained were impressive, with absolute values of 10, 200 and 800 pg being obtained for Cu, Fe and V. The method was validated by the use of CRMs and by the use of alternative techniques.

Effects of the ICP-MS operating conditions on the background intensities at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 32 and 34 were studied, and measures to reduce background intensity, such as alternative cone materials and an alternative GC-ICP-MS interface, were described. This may be a useful starting point for anyone wishing to establish a similar equipment set-up. However, some of the optimization detailed here may be unnecessary on modern ICP-MS systems. A lower sensitivity was noted for S species with a high boiling point and it is suggested that this may be because of discrimination at the GC injection port or decomposition in the column. This, however, required further investigation. The method was successfully applied to naphtha, gasoline, kerosene and light oil; superior sensitivity was observed when compared with conventional methods. Heilmann and Heumann have produced two papers that discussed isotope dilution as a means of S speciation in petroleum products.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73,74</span></sup></a> In the first example, a species specific isotope dilution GC-ICP-MS method for the determination of thiophene derivatives was described.

In addition, the collection efficiency of the spike Hg was independent of the type of sample gas. Use of stainless steel tubing in the presence of hydrogen sulfide led to problems with transport efficiency of the Hg vapour. This was attributed to the steel acting as either a sink, where it retained the Hg, or as a source of extra Hg. This problem was not observed in the absence of the hydrogen sulfide. In addition, the use of a PVC tube did not lead to problems, even in the presence of hydrogen sulfide. The authors questioned the applicability of the ISO standard method of collection of Hg vapour from gases as this uses stainless steel tubing and other components.

These include the use of actual and inferred molecular information to allow the classification of organic compounds, particularly in the area of explosives detection and remote sensing. Coupled with this is the removal of atmospheric interferences from carbon and nitrogen species. In order for a technique to become widely applied in chemical analysis, there needs to be a fundamental understanding of the processes occurring and, to this end, several papers dealt with the processes occurring within the plasma. LIBS is also extensively used in the analysis of historical artefacts and works of art and is often used with a second, complementary technique which allows much more interesting and valuable information to be obtained. Synchrotron radiation sources are becoming more widely available and some interesting applications are reported. Some recent developments in beam lines and their commercial availability are enabling the high resolution 2-dimensional mapping and elemental characterization of complex samples, often on a micro-scale. Also of note during this review period is that atomic absorption techniques appear to be enjoying a renaissance. This is likely to be due to the simplicity and relative low cost of atomic absorption techniques as compared with ICP which does have significant running costs. Several interesting and novel applications are reviewed. As expected, speciation continues to be a very strong theme. Of note during this review period is the increasing use of both molecular and atomic techniques to complement one another and to maximize the information available from an analysis. An example of the use of complementary techniques is the use of ICP-MS and ESI-MS to yield atomic, molecular and structural information. The interactions of pharmaceutical molecules with proteins and the metabolic response to drugs - metabonomics -is of great interest and several papers outlining interesting analytical developments in this field are reviewed.

Baudelet <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> have demonstrated time resolved LIBS for the analysis of organic materials. A major challenge for organic or biological material analysis by LIBS arises because the substances to be analyzed are composed of mainly the same elementals, namely carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. An efficient strategy for detection and discrimination between organic materials is based on determination of ratios between intensities of line emissions from these organic elements, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> O/C, N/C or O/N, which are related to the chemical composition of the organic compounds (see references within this paper). For biological materials, it has been demonstrated that a certain number of diatomic molecular fragments, such as C<small><sub>2</sub></small> or CN, can provide information for their speciation. This strategy does, however, suffer from interferences, particularly those arising from atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen. Because of this, it is important to study the interaction between plasma plume and ambient gas in order to have a realistic estimation of emission from plasma-excited air which depends on the plasma properties such as temperature and density. These properties, in turn, depend on laser parameters (pulse duration, wavelength) and on the physico-chemical properties of the sample. It is therefore important to either minimize emissions of atomic or molecular species (O, N, or CN) due to the interaction between plasma and background gas or make these emissions controllable, in such a way that their contributions can be removed from the total line intensities of oxygen and nitrogen atoms or CN molecules detected in a LIBS spectrum of an organic material. This paper presents time-resolved UV-LIBS for organic material analysis. A sample of nylon was used as a typical organic material and samples of copper and a tablet of aspirin were used as samples with different physico-chemical properties for comparison. The investigations focused on emission from atomic oxygen and nitrogen which can originate from either native organic elements or atmospheric air. A kinetic study of line intensities allowed the contributions of native organic elements to be distinguished from those from the ambient air. For molecular species, kinetic behaviour of the emission from CN bonds was presented and data showed that emission from native CN bonds could be distinguished from that due to recombination with ambient air in a time-resolved study of the molecular line emission intensity. The authors also demonstrated that for UV-LIBS, the laser fluence is a suitable control parameter which allowed specifying the regime with either predominant native CN bonds or with predominant recombination CN bonds. UV-LIBS with low laser fluence allowed detection of native CN bonds thus providing a spectral marker for certain organic materials and an indication of biological materials.</span><p class="otherpara">On a similar theme, Babushok <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> described a fundamental study of the processes occurring within the plasma plume and the development of a kinetic model of these processes occurring within the LIBS plume of cyclotrimethylenetrinitamine (RDX). RDX is an explosive nitroamine widely used in military and industrial applications and is considered one of the most powerful military explosives. The developed model included the processes of formation and quenching of excited H, N and O atoms, and comprised initial decomposition reactions of RDX (or explosive products at the surface of the target material), high-temperature reactions of products of explosive decomposition in the buffer gas under the LIBS conditions and reactions of excited states species responsible for the LIBS signature, including the generation and quenching of excited states (O, H, N) and the subset of reactions of excited species with the decomposition products of RDX and with buffer gas species. A sub model was included for formation of the C<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecule. The observation of LIBS C<small><sub>2</sub></small> signals was used to discriminate organic samples from inorganic targets during detection of energetic materials. Together with peak ratios, the data on C<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission were used for the detection of a number of explosive materials. The sources of data for inclusion into the model are indicated in the paper and the authors were careful to point out that the rate constants were extrapolated from those given at much lower temperatures. The model was therefore examined for errors resulting from the use of this extrapolated data. The work demonstrated that the overall reaction process in the plasma plume could be considered a two-stage process. The first stage corresponds to a fast approach to a quasi-stationary state. The second stage corresponds to a change in the quasi-stationary concentrations of species as a result of the change in temperature. As a result of the two-stage process, the initial composition at the surface of the target, or the initial mechanism of RDX decomposition, was not considered important in determining the LIBS signature in the LIBS measurement time window. The results of modeling with different mechanisms of decomposition are approximately the same during the second stage. The memory of the initial compound was lost within 1μs. This allows the suggested model to be employed for modelling of the LIBS plume of other C/N/H/O-containing energetic materials in the LIBS measurement window (1–30μs).</p><p class="otherpara">Bohling <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> described an all fibre-coupled LIBS device for the field measurement of explosives and surface contamination with explosive residues. Objects such as land mines which are hidden by soil or other improvised explosive devices which can be hidden in a variety of containers prove difficult to detect. This paper showed the development of a miniaturized and all-fibre-coupled LIBS sensor device with the capability of real time remote control and has the option to perform measurements through small drill holes or within the ground. The sensor head consists of a metal tip into which the optical fibres, a focussing lens and a mechanical shutter system for keeping the optics clean while digging in soil for land mine detection are integrated. A fibre bundle collects the LIBS signal and guides it back to the detection units where the LIBS signal is recorded spectrally and temporally resolved and analyzed. The data analysis and classification of the LIBS data is done by combining chemometric data processing tools and neural networks. This approach, for the first time, gives the possibility to add new objects to the database continuously during the analysis procedure itself. In this paper the capability of such an all-fibre-coupled LIBS sensor device is illustrated. Results from field measurements performed at a test facility of the German Armed Forces are discussed. An alternative approach to discrimination of the LIBS signal of explosives from that of the atmospheric background is the use of double pulse experimental approach. De Lucia <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> compared the close-contact (&lt; 1m) LIBS spectra of explosives using single pulse LIBS in argon with double pulse LIBS in the atmosphere. They demonstrated improved discrimination of an explosive and an organic interferent using double pulse LIBS which reduced the air entrained in the analytical plasma. A range of double pulse LIBS experiments have been reported (see the above reference and references therein). In this case the paper is concerned with performing LIBS remote or standoff experiments, and all of the laboratory double pulse LIBS experiments were performed with two collinear pulses. The main advantage of double pulse LIBS is the observed increase in signal and combinations of several factors are thought to be the source of the emission increase. These factors include greater mass ablation, larger plasma volume (so more atoms are excited) and less laser shielding of the second pulse resulting from the decrease in gas density after the first pulse. The authors exploited the decrease in gas density during the double pulse event to minimize atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen in the LIBS spectra, thereby improving the ability to discriminate explosive materials based on relative amounts of oxygen and nitrogen in the interrogated sample. The same authors <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> reported the use of the double pulse technique during the standoff LIBS analysis of a range of hazardous materials. In a third paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> they demonstrated the discrimination of explosives residues from a range of interferences and the separation of explosives into various classes using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). They were able to discriminate among explosive and non-explosive sample spectra acquired at a distance of 20 m and correctly classified samples not contained in the original model. The use of summed intensities and ratios from species observed in the explosives spectra enabled the identification of explosive residues even when mixed with road dust.</p></div><div><span id="sect943"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.2.2 Analysis of historical artifacts. </span><span>There are several papers during this review period which described the use of non-destructive or <span class="italic">quasi</span>-non-destructive techniques in which only a small area, often less than 100 μm is destroyed, for the analysis of historical artifacts.

Arcon <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> investigated the feasibility of iron K-edge XANES as a way of determining the iron(II)/iron(III) ratio in historic inks. Iron gall ink is historically very important having being used from the Middle Ages until the 20<small><sup>th</sup></small> Century. One unfortunate side effect of these inks however is their propensity to cause degradation of paper. Unfortunately 60–70% of Leonardo da Vinci's oeuvre is showing signs of deterioration and a similar situation exists with many other historical documents including Bach's scores which are virtually falling apart. The authors referred to literature suggesting that the two main reasons for this degradation are acid hydrolysis and oxidation, caused by ferrous ions. Other techniques which have been used for the total iron and Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratios in gall iron inks, specifically XRF and PIXE do not yield information on the oxidation state of the iron. In XANES, the valence state of metal cations can be deduced and this, together with the use of XANES as a technique for the analysis of relative amounts of Fe(II) in historic gall inks, is described in the paper. Faubel and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> discussed the increased efforts to preserve our cultural heritage in the form of historical books and manuscripts which are being endangered by the corrosive effects of the inks and colouring materials employed. They discussed several non-destructive analytical procedures, specifically the application of a novel combination of synchrotron radiation induced micro-XRF and FTIR microscopy to investigate the state of historical documents and the effectiveness of conservation procedures. This paper described measurements on several documents and artefacts including iron gall ink on a document dating from 1769. One paper has reported the use of LA for both cleaning and analysis of the resulting LIBS spectra of the surface layers of historical paper documents.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit103"><sup><span class="sup_ref">103</span></sup></a> The authors proposed that ablative cleaning be coupled with the use of the LIBS spectroscopic information generated to identify the composition of the contaminant layers non-destructively and of the surface pigment layers almost non-destructively. Resulting detrimental post-processing effects were discussed and these included a decrease in resistance to tearing and stretching (tensile strength) of the documents. The ablative cleaning was reported to result in the complete removal of the contaminants over small areas. The effects of wavelength of the laser was investigated and UV radiation was found to result in significant damage to the paper fibres resulting in a decreased resistance to tearing whereas exposure to visible and IR radiation resulted in much less damage.

Prior to LA-ICPMS analysis, all the pigments and substrate samples were subjected to SEM-EDX and Raman inspection, since these are non-destructive techniques. The results from this investigation were discussed in detail. LA-ICP-MS was employed and spatially resolved (both laterally and in depth) quantitative multi-element information for 42 analytes present in a wide concentration range (from microgram per gram to 10% level) was achieved. In addition to the intrinsic value of these results, this information, after suitable data processing, was demonstrated to be very useful for fingerprinting purposes. Cotte <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit107"><sup><span class="sup_ref">107</span></sup></a> employed synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy techniques during the analysis of German 16<small><sup>th</sup></small> century paintings. This work was facilitated by recent developments at the ID21 beam line (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF). A submicron X-ray fluorescence probe revealed the main presence of Ca, Pb, S and Sb. The fluorescence-line interferences (in particular K-lines of S with M-lines of Pb, and K-lines of Ca with L-lines of Sb) were resolved with the fitting program, PyMCA. 2D-mapping was made possible by the high resolution and highlighted the presence of micrometer grains of S and Sb in a lead matrix. XANES measurements were performed at both the S K-edge and the Sb L-edge to gain information at the molecular level. Beam stability was a key point in this study to selectively probe micrometer pigment grains dispersed in the lead matrix. The authors confirmed that the grains were made of stibnite (antimony sulfide), a very atypical pigment. Chemical mapping of sulfides was perfectly correlated with Sb mapping and provided a clear visualization of the stibnite pigments, in addition to their identification. Besides its artistic relevancy, this work aimed at illustrating developments of synchrotron X-ray microprobe methods for the chemical characterization and observation of complex and micrometer-scale materials. It is likely that synchrotron sources will become much more widely used for analysis in a range of areas particularly heterogeneous samples requiring high spatial resolution due to the high signal to noise ratios achieved with the high flux densities available. This article illustrates the recent developments of these micro-analytical methods, namely the combination of micro-X-ray fluorescence at low energies and micro-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (μ-XANES) for elemental and chemical imaging at the sub-micrometer scale.

However, some well documented difficulties occur in the ETAAS cadmium determination such as the interference effects of anions and cations, non-specific absorption and the loss of the volatile analyte. The authors reported the development and optimisation of analytical methods for Cd determination in <span class="italic">Orujo</span> spirits by ETAAS using tungsten, iridium and tungsten-iridium permanent modifiers to minimise the matrix effects and losses due to volatility. The analytical characteristics of the methods developed were compared with those obtained when classical chemical modifiers such as Pd–Mg(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small> and (NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>)H<small><sub>2</sub></small>PO<small><sub>4</sub></small> were used. Experimental design was also used to optimize the ETAAS methods. The application of the chemometric procedure resulted in rapid and efficient optimization of the different factors influencing the analytical signal. Plackett-Burman designs were applied in the first step as a screening method to evaluate the most significant factors with just a few experiments. In the second step, the optimum conditions for the significant parameters were obtained employing a two-level factorial central composite design. The authors found that of all the methods developed, those based on permanent modifiers presented better analytical characteristics than those based on classical modifiers. Gil <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> reported a “greener” method for the determination of sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate (thiomersal) in ophthalmic solutions. Thiomersal is an organomercurial (approximately 49% mercury by weight) that is commonly used as both an antiseptic and an antimicrobial preservative in pharmaceutical formulations. This organomercurial has been added to some vaccines, cosmetics, eye-drops and contact lens solutions as a preservative to prevent bacterial contamination. Nevertheless, increased concern has arisen due to its instability, which can give rise to the formation of toxic ethylmercury. Analytical methods for the determination of thiomersal include enzymatic amperometry, ETAAS, high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and colorimetry. Cold vapour-atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS) is a widely employed technique for the determination of Hg at the ultra-trace level, but a prior step for conversion of organomercurials into Hg(II) is required. Most of the methods employed for oxidation of organomercurials, including thiomersal, generally require the use of strong acids, oxidants and high temperatures for decomposition in both batch and on-line procedures, which results in the production of harmful wastes of significant environmental impact. The generation of toxic wastes is becoming recognised as being as important as any other analytical feature. The authors described a sono-induced cold vapour generation technique (SI-CVG) which has eliminated the need for conventional reducing reagents such as NaBH<small><sub>4</sub></small> or SnCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> for determination of Hg by AAS. The SI-CVG technique is accomplished with formic acid as the sole chemical reagent. This reagent partly decomposes upon ultrasound irradiation to yield both reducing gases and radicals within the analytical run, which promotes cold vapour generation and is non-toxic and biodegradable. A drawback inherent with SI-CVG is the presence of oxidizing substances which preclude the reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) by ultrasound. Intensive wet digestion procedures have been commonly employed for degradation of thiomersal, but they may cause difficulties when applied in combination with the SI-CVG technique owing to the excess of oxidising acids remaining after treatment. Advanced oxidation procedures such as UV/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> or ultrasound/O<small><sub>3</sub></small> or UV/O<small><sub>3</sub></small> rely on the generation of powerful OH radicals, which can rapidly react with organic compounds. Additionally, such procedures do not add any excess oxidising agents to the sample solution and, consequently, should ideally fit the sample preparation for SI-CVG. In this work, the combination of the SI-CVG technique and the UV/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> procedure was applied to the determination of thiomersal in eye-drop solutions as a greener alternative to conventional CVG following wet digestion. The authors described the optimisation of the digestion procedure in detail and the determination of thiomersal in a range of ophthalmic solutions was demonstrated.

Forsgard <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> described the use of column switched LC-ICP-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS for the screening and identification of Al containing biomolecules in soils, which may pose toxicological risks. The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of ICP-ToF-MS with reversed-phase LC separation to the screening and fingerprinting of aluminium-chelated siderophores in field-soil solutions. The ability to detect Al with ICP-MS has traditionally been problematic due to the solvents used as organic modifiers in reversed phase LC, which caused plasma instabilities and a high background signal due to isobaric interferences with aluminium as well as a reduction in signal due to space charge effects. In order to detect low concentrations of Al in natural samples the LC-ICP-MS method was optimized to minimize the formation of these interfering species and to maximize the analytical signal. To achieve this, the authors investigated several mobile phases and plasma conditions and very significant improvements in signal to noise ratios were reported. The developed LC setup was also coupled to ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS and these molecular techniques were utilized to identify and characterize aluminium-chelated siderophores in a natural field soil solution sample.

Problems with the supply of the enriched isotopes required that they check the possibility of using a natural abundance internal standard for quantitation. This paper demonstrated that, when compound independent sensitivity was assured, the use of an internal standard eliminated the need for any external calibration of the response of the instrument. This allows determination of the analytes in a way which is similar to the use of isotope dilution analysis without species specific calibration standards. Importantly, it was noted that compound independent calibration is only an approximate quantification strategy and cannot compete with species-specific isotope dilution analysis in terms of the control of the recovery of the analytical procedure. The halogenated compounds selected for this work were the trihalomethanes. These compounds are the main disinfection by-products formed during water chlorination. Increasingly strict regulations are requiring new methodologies for the quantification of trihalomethanes.

This material was developed and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Japan. The authors described the synthesis and certification of this material by four independent analytical techniques (ICP-MS, ICP-OES, GFAAS and LC-ICP-MS). Trace environmental analysis has been highly topical for many years but more recently the necessity for speciation at trace levels in environmental samples is being realised. Campillo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> proposed two procedures for the simultaneous determination of selenite and two organoseleniums, dimethyl selenide (DMSe) and dimethyldiselenide (DMDSe). This paper discussed the importance of selenium speciation and cited five review papers which the reader may find useful. Both procedures involved preconcentration by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) in the head space, in order to achieve the low detection limits required. Analysis was achieved using GC-AED. Water samples from a range of sources, including seawater were analyzed, both derivatization and extraction procedures were optimised and recoveries were checked using spiked samples. Detection limits in the low ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range were achieved and 96% to 98% recoveries were reported. This paper illustrated the need for speciation at trace levels in environmental samples and it is likely that the importance of trace level speciation will grow in the near future as many of the species finding their way into the environment are still largely unknown.</p><p class="otherpara">One aspect of speciation which is becoming increasingly important is the study of the metabolic response to drugs, this field is often known as metabonomics. Vanhaecke and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> reported the development of an ICP-MS procedure for the metabolism studies of a new Br-containing anti-tuberculosis compound, R207910. During drug discovery, and before a prospective drug can be launched onto the market, it is a requirement that the fate of the drug should be known after it enters the human body. Part of this study involved the metabolite profiling of the candidate compound including the determination of the amount of compound-related material in the excreta, and identification and quantification of the metabolites to understand the metabolic fate of the compound. The latter has traditionally been done by HPLC with UV detection, mass spectrometric detection or radiochemical detection. With UV detection, there is the likelihood that some metabolites will remain undetected, while the picture may be further obscured by a lack of specificity. Additionally, the sensitivity of the UV and mass spectrometry methods is strongly dependent on the molecular structure of the compounds, so the availability of synthetic standards is required for quantification. As this is often not feasible in the initial phase of drug discovery, radio-labelling is frequently employed but this can be expensive and time-consuming and there are obvious issues associated with human studies involving radio-labelled molecules. This is especially so in the case of R207910 due to its long blood plasma half life and high tissue penetration. To minimise these disadvantages, the authors have reported the use of HPLC-ICP-MS, as a compound independent technique for the analysis of drug compounds containing an element detectable by ICP-MS, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Br, Cl, Pt or S. This paper described the development of this methodology for the detection of bromine-containing metabolites of this drug in faeces of animals which had been dosed with R207910 and the results were compared with those achieved by the use of carbon 14 radio-labelled material. The paper fully described the experiments, including the use of a cooled spray chamber, narrow injector tube, a PFA-LC nebulizer and oxygen addition to the plasma to minimise carbon build up. The authors discussed the possibility of the results being different from those obtained using radio-labelled experiments and attributed any differences to the possibility that some of the metabolites may lose their radio-label during metabolism, and similarly, in the case of ICP-MS detection, some of the metabolites may have lost their ICP-MS detectable atom, in this case, Br. The ICP-MS detection was therefore seen as being complementary to radiochemical techniques. The paper also discussed the use of gradient elution and the resulting change in the ICP-MS response, which resulted in poor stability and poor quantitation. The use of species-non-specific isotope dilution to minimise this response drift was suggested and this is the subject of a second paper from the same group.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> Here they employed organic mass spectrometry in combination with inorganic techniques, and this is increasingly used as a means of gaining speciation and/or structural information in addition to the quantitative information. In this paper, the authors used a combination of HPLC-ICP-MS and HPLC-ESI-MS for the metabolite profiling of R207910. HPLC-ESI-MS was used for the structural identification of the active molecule and its metabolites. The <small><sup>79</sup></small>Br/<small><sup>81</sup></small>Br isotope ratio was used to search for bromine containing metabolites in the complex chromatographic background using HPLC-ESI-MS and these bromine-specific mass chromatograms were referred to as ‘bromatograms’. A combination of accurate mass measurements and structural information were obtained from collision-induced fragmentation by means of MS<small><sup>2</sup></small> using a quadrupole-Time of Flight and a LTQ-Orbitrap instrument. The experimental conditions were described in detail. Quantitation of the Br containing molecules (metabolites and parent compound) was achieved by HPLC-ICP-MS using species unspecific isotope dilution (described in detail in the paper). The use of this procedure based on the measurement of the ratio of the two bromine isotopes resulted in a very stable response which was not affected by the solvent gradient and the results were in good agreement with those obtained from carbon-14 radiochemical detection. The HPLC-ESI-MS ‘bromatograms’ were similar to those obtained by HPCL-ICP-MS. In addition, the combination of the molecular and elemental analyses enabled structure elucidation and good quantitation of the metabolites in the biological matrices of interest. Brominated organic compounds are also of interest in atmospheric chemistry and specifically, the <small><sup>81</sup></small>Br:<small><sup>79</sup></small>Br ratio has potential for the study of the source, transport and fate of these compounds. Sylva <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> described the use of GC-multi-collector ICP-MS to determine this ratio in brominated organic compounds.

It is based on the selective targeting of radioactivity to tumour tissue expressing a specific antigen <span class="italic">via</span> radio-labelled monoclonal antibodies. The advantage over more conventional chemotherapeutic techniques is that the radiotoxic effects on normal organs is limited. Yttrium-90 is the most widely used radionuclide employed in the radio-immunotherapy of solid tumours because of its favourable radiological properties. Ciavardelli and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a> proposed a novel approach to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of yttrium-90 based radio-immunotherapy using a stable isotope surrogate. They employed <small><sup>89</sup></small>Y as a stable tracer of <small><sup>90</sup></small>Y to evaluate the urinary clearance of the radio-labelled antibody and they described an ICP-MS procedure as a highly sensitive and accurate method of detection to quantify the amount of Y in the urine of the test animal. Labelled antibody fragments were characterized by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. ICP-MS detection limits for Y at the single figure ppt level in urine were achieved and accurate Y concentrations were determined without the need for any sample preparation. The authors suggested that this procedure fulfils the accuracy and precision requirements necessary for long term pharmacokinetic studies in animal models.</p><p class="otherpara">The detection and quantification of metalloproteins is becoming increasingly important for clinical diagnosis, since alterations in their formation or expression can be an indicator of disease. Hyphenated techniques such as HPLC-ICP-MS are commonly used for trace elemental speciation. A common problem with the analysis of biomolecules such as metalloproteins is that the complexed metals can be labile under certain conditions, allowing the metal to be released and the protein to elute or migrate as its apo form. Dissociation and transformation or irreversible binding of proteins to the column material during the analytical procedure must be carefully considered. Furthermore, quality control in metalloprotein analysis is problematic because of the lack of suitable standards and reference materials for biological species. Deitrich <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> described the preparation and characterization of an isotopically enriched superoxide dismutase standard to be used for species specific isotope dilution analysis. When the stoichiometry of metals in a metalloprotein is known and an identical isotopically enriched species is available, it is possible to perform species-specific isotope dilution mass spectrometry (SS-IDMS). In this case, the protein concentration can be determined <span class="italic">via</span> its elemental concentration. This is also possible using the species-unspecific approach if the stoichiometry of the metal-protein complex is known. However, the species-specific spiking approach is superior because losses of the analyte after spiking can be corrected for. SS-IDMS of metalloproteins, especially where non-covalent protein-metal interactions are involved, requires carefully chosen and maintained conditions in order that no loss of the metal centre or redistribution between free metal isotopes and the isotopes of the spike and sample protein occur. An important benefit of SS-IDMS is that species transformation during sample preparation and chromatography can be controlled and even quantified. SS-IDMS is, therefore, a useful tool for evaluating analyte stability and behaviour during the analytical procedure. This paper contained many useful references on this subject together with a review which the reader may find useful and described in detail the production and characterization of the enriched superoxide dismutase, together with an investigation of its stability. The authors claimed that this is the first report detailing the production of an isotopically enriched metalloenzyme, containing two different isotopically enriched metal cofactors, which can be used as a standard in species-specific IDMS. The study showed that it is possible to chemically produce an isotopically enriched superoxide dismutase with various isotopic abundances of the enriched <small><sup>65</sup></small>Cu and <small><sup>68</sup></small>Zn. The stability of the metalloprotein standard under speciation conditions was tested, and no exchange of the <small><sup>65</sup></small>Cu and <small><sup>68</sup></small>Zn was observed after addition of excess Cu, Zn or a chelating agent. This application shows the potential of using isotopically enriched superoxide dismutase for the accurate quantification of that enzyme in real samples. General limitations of this approach were that the native enzyme activity was not completely restored in the isotopically enriched enzyme. In addition, denaturation of the protein may have taken place during the de-metalation procedure especially at low pH. The authors also stated that, despite all the advantages of SS-IDMS, a huge effort is necessary to produce and characterize an isotopically enriched protein spike. Therefore, this approach may only be sensible in practice for the assay of essential proteins or biomarkers. The development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS<small><sup>n</sup></small>) in the late 1980s has enabled the determination of the molecular weights of intact proteins, the analysis of their amino acid sequences, and the characterization of structural modifications of peptides and proteins. Hartinger and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> described the characterization of the protein binding interactions of anti-cancer metallodrugs specifically the platinum family of drugs and compared MALDI and ESI ionisation techniques. Platinum complexes are known to bind to a high degree to plasma proteins but the role of the binding of tumour-inhibiting metal-based drugs to proteins is not well understood and there are inconsistencies for different metal complexes. Additionally, for platinum complexes a significant contribution to side effects is thought to be due to the binding of proteins. In contrast, the good tolerability and tumour specificity of ruthenium drug candidates is thought to be strongly dependent on binding to transferrin, and also to albumin, therefore exploiting the enhanced mobility and retention effect could contribute to the mode of action of the metal complexes. There are also questions regarding the preferred binding sites of metal complexes on proteins. Recently, model proteins such as ubiquitin (Ub), myoglobin, and cytochrome-c (Cyt-C) have been utilized in mass spectrometric studies on the binding of anticancer metal coordination compounds to proteins with both clinically established and developmental drugs (see the paper by the authors and references therein). The authors reported a comparative study on the applicability of nESI (nano-electrospray ionization) and MALDI techniques for the analysis of the binding of the tumour-inhibiting anti-cancer agents oxaliplatin and the cis-platin drug, CDDP and the <span class="italic">trans</span>-isomer, TDDP of the latter towards the model protein ubiquitin. The advantages and disadvantages of the compared methods for studying the metal complex-protein interaction were discussed. The authors claimed that this is the first report on the use of MALDI-MS to characterize a protein-metal drug interaction. For the first time MALDI-MS was found to be suitable to characterize Ub-platinum complex adducts. However, with high molecular weight proteins, the resolution of the MALDI-ToF-MS was thought unlikely to be sufficient to unambiguously characterize metal-protein adducts. MALDI also resulted in increased fragmentation products with respect to cleavage of the ligands from the Pt complex and this was thought to make interpretation errors more problematic. For example, a Ub–Pt species was observed only in the MALDI spectra and therefore presumably corresponds to a species generated in the instrument rather than existing in solution. The ion trap instrument had advantages when higher sensitivity was required—bis adducts of oxaliplatin were detected, which were not observed in the MALDI or in the nESI-QToF mass spectra. This paper demonstrated that MALDI-MS is a useful method for the analysis of metal binding to low molecular weight proteins even though it delivers lower resolution mass spectra than ESI. The MALDI data appear to be ideally suited to providing spectra from which kinetic constants can be estimated and may be useful in developing non-classical metal drugs that target proteins rather than DNA. Phytochelatins are metal binding ligands found in hyper-accumulating plants. Since hyper-accumulating plants have the potential to be used in phyto-remediation efforts to detoxify contaminated sites, there is great commercial interest in developing a “green” cost-effective clean-up method for metal contaminated sites. Furthermore, low toxicity ligands such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and other similar compounds have been used to enhance the bioavailability of heavy metals for plant uptake; a process called chelate assisted phyto-remediation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a> The successful use of plants to extract metals from contaminated soils requires a better understanding of the mechanisms of metal uptake, translocation and accumulation within the plant. Consequently, this requires the development of accurate methods for the determination of polycarboxylic metal complexes in such environmental matrices. As with the work on the brominated drug described above, the authors also described the use of molecular analysis and atomic analysis as complimentary techniques to gain both structural and sensitive quantitative information. Their novel approach employed FI coupled with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (FI-ESI-MS) to obtain speciation information without prior separation and IC-ICP-MS for the sensitive quantitation of the species of interest. The analytical performances of these procedures were evaluated by analyzing soil samples from a lead contaminated site undergoing chelate assisted phyto-remediation. Reversible protein phosphorylation is considered to be one of the most abundant fundamental steps in cellular processes in which post-translational protein modifications are involved.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> Many corresponding cellular mechanisms including cell signalling, metabolism and apoptosis (programmed cell death) are dependent on this biochemical reaction. Consequently, there is much interest in accessing quantitative information about the phosphoproteome and the phosphorylation degree of single proteins in certain cell compartments. Traditional strategies for detection and quantification of phosphorylation sites are <span class="italic">in-vivo</span> and <span class="italic">in-vitro</span> incorporation of radioactive phosphorus. As these methods require significant amounts of radioactive compounds, mass spectrometric methods are becoming the methodology of choice. Based on MALDI or ESI ionisation, mass spectrometry can provide accurate information on the molecular mass of intact proteins with an estimation of the phosphorylation degree from the molecular weight distribution pattern, whereas the analysis of phosphorylation
sites and stoichiometry may require further MS or MS/MS techniques. This paper referenced some reviews and early papers in this field which the reader may find useful. In order to supplement the existing ICP-MS methods, the authors reported the concept of a recently developed on-line coupling of gel electrophoresis and ICP-sector field-MS for the determination of phosphorylated proteins. As this is a new development, this new application to proteins was realised on the basis of a one-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation prior to ICP-MS detection. By simultaneous monitoring of <small><sup>31</sup></small>P<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>32</sup></small>S<small><sup>+</sup></small> as naturally occurring elemental tags, the authors determined the phosphorylation degree of alpha- and beta-casein. The authors described their experimental conditions in detail and initial work was done to elucidate the electrophoretic migration behaviour and the ICP-MS detection of caseins with the proposed coupling system. The paper showed that the use of P/S ratio measurements enabled the determination of the amount of protein-bound phosphate with acceptable precision. Since this method required knowledge about the number of S-containing amino acids in the entire protein, the proposed concept was limited to well-characterized proteins. Proteins with unknown structure would need to be identified by accompanying molecular MS methods like ESI-MS or MALDI-MS. The limited separation power of one-dimensional GE was the main restriction in the analysis of complex samples, so that co-elutions of interfering compounds have to be excluded.</p><p class="otherpara">Organophosphorus nerve agents are categorized as some of the most toxic species ever created. These compounds hydrolyze in the environment into specific alkyl phosphonic acids which provide an indirect means for monitoring release of the parent nerve agents. Richardson and Caruso<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> described the application of a GC-ICP-MS method, previously reported for the determination of organophosphorus nerve agent degradation products, but now for the presence of mixtures of organophosphorus pesticides. Sample preparation and instrumental parameters were described in some detail. Initial experiments consisted of the analysis of individual pesticide standards of dichlorvos, ethion and parathion ethyl in the presence of a mixture of seven organophosphorus nerve agent degradation products. The degradation products of sarin, cyclosarin and soman as well as their common final hydrolysis product (MPA) were rapidly detected in mixtures of the three pesticides. Pesticide mixture concentrations ranging from 5 to 10 times greater than those of the degradation products were shown to have no effect on the identification of the nerve agent degradation product of interest. This application demonstrated that the chromatographic resolution of the GC separation method was sufficient to resolve possible interfering species from the nerve agent degradation products of interest. The same group also described the derivatization of organophosphorus nerve agent degradation products for analysis by GC with ICP-MS and ToF-MS detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> Organophosphorus nerve agent degradation products are non-volatile, highly polar species with no useful chromophore. Due to the highly specific hydrolysis pathway of the parent chemical warfare agent, which was described in the paper, the analysis of the less toxic degradation products provides an alternative technique for the detection of such materials. In this work, the application of GC-ICP-MS to the determination of common degradation products of the chemical warfare agents Soman, Sarin, Tabun, RVX and VX is described. Optimization of temperature and time for the formation of <span class="italic">tert</span>-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDM) derivatives of seven degradation products was described and confirmation of the formation of TBDMS derivatives for six of the chemical warfare agents degradation products of interest was determined by GC-ToF-MS. Analytical figures of merit for each species studied were presented, with detection limits in the low pg range being reported. The method developed was applied to river water and soil matrices to determine the sensitivity of ICP-MS for these organophosphorus nerve agent degradation product derivatives. The authors are reportedly investigating the use of alternative derivatization techniques, including TMS, p-bromophenol and pentafluorbenzyl esters, as well as the use of solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) preconcentration to analyze these degradation products although this work was not reported in this paper. Zhai <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> described a novel procedure for the determination and speciation of methyltins in process wastewaters. Organotin compounds have been distributed extensively in the environment because of their extensive applications as biocides, antifouling agents and polymer stabilizers. These compounds have the potential to cause harm to aquatic organisms and their use as antifouling agents has been banned in many countries. Speciation of organotins is based on the on-line coupling of chromatographic procedures with various detectors. Among the GC-based systems, the most extensively used detectors were AAS, mass spectrometry, ICP-MS and the quartz surface-induced luminescence flame photometric detector (QSIL-FPD). The authors referenced two other papers describing this latter technique, which is shown to possess very high selectivity and low detection limits for organotin compounds. In this paper, QSIL-FPD was employed as a HPLC detector for the speciation of methyltin compounds. The paper described the optimization of mobile phase conditions as well as describing how the methyltin compounds separated by the HPLC and derivatized using post-column addition of the derivatization reagent to generate volatile hydride products by a hydride generation (HG) reaction with potassium borohydride. The derivatization products were separated from the liquid matrix with a newly developed microporous membrane gas-liquid separator (MGLS) as the HPLC-FPD interface and introduced into the QSIL-FPD for detection. This instrumentation was described in detail in the paper, as were the optimization of all the parameters. The detection limit for trimethyltin was claimed to be sub ppb (ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), which was higher than those obtained by ICP-MS but the high levels of organic solvents from the HPLC separation were claimed to be problematic for ICP-MS procedures. Recovery studies showed quantitative recovery of the organotins. The authors suggested that, with a preconcentration step such as solid phase extraction, this procedure could be a low cost alternative to ICP-MS for the speciation and sensitive detection of organotin compounds. Additionally, they suggested that this procedure could be extended to other hydride forming metals such as lead, selenium, mercury and arsenic.</p></div><h3 id="sect1058"><span class="b_heading">2.3 Inorganic chemicals and acids</span></h3><span>This has been a vibrant area of research in this review period.

Many of these applications involve the analysis of gunshot residue. Although many of these studies proved to be successful there were, however, a couple that were either inconclusive or failed to prove what the authors had hoped. Among the more successful papers is one by Sarkis and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">147</span></sup></a> These authors used a solution of EDTA on a swab to collect residue from the hands of volunteers who had fired either 9mm or 0.4 inch caliber pistols and using either Taurus or Clean Range ammunition. Once collected, the samples were analyzed for Ba, Pb and Sb using SF-HR-ICP-MS, which enabled concentrations lower than 1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to be determined. A clear discrimination between shooters and non-shooters was observed from the analytical data. In addition, the authors also discussed the importance of the sampling procedure including collection of samples from a different body part as well as the gun hand of the suspect. A paper by Wunnapuk and co-workers tested the skin around gunshot entry wounds and compared it with other skin areas.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit148"><sup><span class="sup_ref">148</span></sup></a> Using ICP-OES as a means of detection, it was found that discrimination between different ammunition types could be made. A fully jacketed bullet caused an increase in Fe and Zn on the skin whereas an unjacketed bullet (a lead bullet) led to a large deposit of Pb. A correlation between the Pb content and the analytes Ba and Sb was also noted for both ammunition types. Another paper used ICP-MS and SEM-EDX to obtain elemental data from gunshot residues and then applied a chemometric approach (regularized discriminant analysis) to the data so that the residues may be classified according to different groups, i.e. “gunshot residue characteristic”, “consistent with gunshot residue” and “environmental particles”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">149</span></sup></a> In addition, an attempt was made to identify the brand of ammunition used. According to the authors, it is getting increasingly difficult to differentiate between types of ammunition as well as between the classification of particle type. These authors used a specially designed shooting device to keep the external conditions unchanged. This device enabled them to use defined distances between the shooter and the target. The determination of firing range is a subject that has also been tackled by Gagliano-Candela and co-workers, who used ETAAS to determine Pb in samples of filter paper that had been shot using a Colt 38 Special from distances of 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 80 and 100 cm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit150"><sup><span class="sup_ref">150</span></sup></a> Each sample was cut into three rings with external diameters of 1.4, 5 and 10.2 cm. A plot of the logarithm of the Pb concentration in each ring against the firing distance enabled a linear correlation to be established. A SEM-EDX study of gunshot residue from a shooter's hands and from the inside of the cartridge case was performed by Brozek-Mucha.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">151</span></sup></a> Three types of 9 mm Luger ammunition were tested, i.e. different types of detonator; viz. lead azide or lead styphnate, mercury fulminate or an organic based one, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> diazodinitrophenol. In addition, other types of ammunition, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> copper and tin plated projectiles were also tested. The author noted that although there were similarities, there were also some differences in the chemical composition and morphology observed from gunshot residue collected from the hands and from the cartridges. This was apportioned to the projectile itself depositing some residue. The author warned that the distribution and chemical composition of the residue depends strongly on the direction of the reaction path starting in the primer, moving along the cartridge case and finishing when the projectile leaves the gun muzzle. It was concluded that for a reliable comparison of the airborne residue, considerable experience based on laboratory experiments performed under controlled conditions was necessary. Two papers by Molina and co-workers have also described the analysis of gunshot residue taken from suicide victims. In the first of these applications, SEM-EDX was used for the analysis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152</span></sup></a>; whereas in the second, ICP-OES was used.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">153</span></sup></a> In the first of these applications 116 cases were studied and the hands of the victims were tested for gunshot residue as well as being analyzed for calibre of weapon and proximity of wound. It was found that SEM-EDX identified an undisputed gunshot residue particle in only 50% of cases and that the spatial distribution of residue on the hands could lead to identifying the manner in which the weapon was being held in only 18% of cases. The authors concluded that the low sensitivity of the instrumentation along with the low percentage of identification of discernible patterns of residue meant that SEM-EDX was of limited use for such studies. In the second of the applications, the authors performed a very similar study, but using ICP-OES as a means of sample analysis. Data from 102 cases were reported.

Therefore, the use of LIBS has continued its growth. Nicolas and co-workers discussed the use of LIBS for the analysis of non-flat surfaces.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> The first step was to make a detailed contour map of the surface of the sample and then, using this information, a constant distance between sample surface and both the focusing and collection optics could be maintained. In this way it was possible to use a home-made computer programme to develop a three dimensional map of the chemical composition of the surface. Two papers have discussed the analysis of powders. In one, Gondal <span class="italic">et al.</span> determined the role of binding materials such as potassium bromide, poly(vinyl alcohol), starch, silver and aluminium.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> The overall aim was to determine the matrix effects caused by the different binders in an attempt to improve the overall performance of LIBS analysis. Using four Mg lines (518.3, 517.2, 383.8 and 279.5 nm) pellets containing known concentrations of Mg in the binders were analyzed. The influence of laser intensity on ablated mass and on signal intensity was determined. It was found that the binding material played a significant role in the formation of the LIBS signal, with relative signal strength being very different for different binders (i.e. 735, 538, 387, 227 and 130 for potassium bromide, starch, poly(vinyl alcohol), silver and aluminium respectively). The authors concluded that potassium bromide is the best binder for use with powdered samples.

Samples were pulverized to a particle size of approximately 30 μm so that they could be trapped in micro-holes in the quartz sub-target and then analyzed directly. For all samples, it was possible to obtain good quality spectra with a low background signal, free from contamination from the sub-target. Sensitivity was in the ppm range and linear calibrations were achieved that had a zero intercept.

Potential interferences arising from concomitants such as Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were evaluated and, unfortunately, were found to be significant in many cases. For As, the presence of Fe(III) led to a signal enhancement of 50%, whereas for Sb the presence of Fe(III), Cu(II) or Cr(III) led to a signal depression of up to 75%. The presence of Cd and Mn also produced suppression of the Sb signal but to a lesser extent (approx. 25%). These interferences were found to occur even at very low concentration (2–20 pg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). The microplasma was found to be sufficiently robust to withstand the presence of 4.2 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> hydrogen (which corresponds to a composition of 28%).

The ratio of the intensity of the Fe line at 371.994 nm to that at the Ag line 328.069 nm was used to create a calibration curve. Using this calibration curve an “unknown” gamma-iron(III) oxide - alginate - silver pellet was analyzed.

The purity of the nanotubes was then verified by techniques such as SEM, TEM, thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The measurement of particle size of nanoparticles is clearly very important and two groups have tackled this issue.

The authors used laser induced incandescence during the production of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in a flame reactor. The effects of laser fluence on the spectral structure of the laser excited radiation emitted from the particles were determined. It was noted that in many cases such radiation cannot be assumed to be an incandescence signal. Measurements of the signal time decay were reported and interpreted and the dependence of time decay on the particle size was demonstrated. The onset of formation of nanoparticles in an ethylene/air flame was studied using a large assortment of analytical techniques by Paganini and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> Laser induced incandescence, optical imaging, visible imaging and spectroscopic analysis of optical emission were all used and the results were used in conjunction with those obtained using a particle size analyzer.

The determination of Xe is important, since it comprises up to 90% of the gaseous materials found in nuclear fuel which, in turn, contains up to 20% gaseous fission materials.

The first strategy was to inject a known quantity of a reference gas into the LA-ICP-MS carrier gas stream. The other strategy involved the ablation of a “matrix matched” standard of non-irradiated uranium dioxide sample that had been implanted with a known amount of <small><sup>129</sup></small>Xe. Both of these two quantification methods enabled the successful determination of Xe, but the direct injection of gas into the carrier stream proved to be the more simple to apply. This method was very simple and yielded linear calibration curves, had good reproducibility and the matrix interferences were described as being within the uncertainty of the measurements. It was necessary though to filter the ablated gas stream to dispose of fine particulate matter that may otherwise create interferences. Results were in good agreement with those obtained using computer simulations.</p><p class="otherpara">Several research groups have published papers reporting the analysis of plutonium-based materials.

As always, solid sampling has been the sample introduction method of choice since it overcomes the necessity of tricky, lengthy or potentially dangerous dissolution steps. As such, X-ray techniques have continued to be commonly used. Historically though, there has been a problem with finding suitable standards or certified reference materials for the use with X-ray spectrometry for these materials. This has been addressed in a paper by Mans and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a> who reported the development of suitable plastic standards for X-ray fluorescence analysis. The standards were based on acrylonitrile-butadiene - styrene terpolymer and contained the elements Br, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb (the analytes covered under the EU “Restriction on use of certain Hazardous Substances” RoHS directive). The materials were produced as both granules and as solid bodies and were not formed from dilution of a master batch, but instead were produced as nine independent calibration samples. The authors stated that this was necessary so that inter-elemental corrections and empirical constant mass absorption coefficients could be determined. The materials were characterized by ICP-OES for all analytes except Br, which was determined using neutron activation analysis. There was a good correlation between the X-ray data and the data from the alternative techniques. Another paper (written in Japanese) by Nakano <span class="italic">et al.</span> also reported the development of CRMs for plastic materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> The materials, developed by the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry, were labelled JSAC 0631 and JSAC 0632. The materials were prepared as disks by filling aluminium cylindrical moulds with the raw material (a polyester resin with a hardener and some organometallic compounds). Once formed, the disks were ground and polished and the homogeneity evaluated by sending sub-samples to 24 laboratories. Any outlying data were identified as such by z-scores and were eliminated from the pool of data.</span></div><div><span id="sect1713"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.2 Advances in analytical methodology. </span><span>Two papers have described the use of LIBS for analysis of plastic materials. In the first,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit258"><sup><span class="sup_ref">258</span></sup></a> Gaspard and colleagues used the technique to characterize cinematographic films. Using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 266nm and by ablating the same spot repetitively, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing the various layers of the film, i.e. the thin layer of protective cross-linked gelatine on top of the layer of photographic emulsion which was supported by the polymeric support (plasticized cellulose triacetate). Analytical lines of Ag from the light sensitive salts within the photographic emulsion as well as lines from Cr Fe, P and Pb were all identified. The Fe and Pb were identified as coming from film developers whereas the Cr originated from hardening agents and the P from the plasticizer. The general aim of the work was to identify the optimal conditions for conservation. However, the study also enabled the classification of different gelatine preparations and of the photographic emulsions. In the second of the two LIBS papers, Gondal and Siddiqu identified different types of plastic (low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylenes (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) as an aid for waste management and re-cycling.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a> Again a Nd:YAG laser was used, but this time at a wavelength of 1024 nm and with an energy of 40mJ. The assorted polymers were distinguished by the relative C and H responses with C/H ratios of 1.68, 1.51, 1.42, 1.16, 1.01 and 0.91 being achieved for HDPE, LDPE, PS, PP, PET and PVC respectively. The authors concluded that LIBS offers the advantages of real time analysis without sample pre-treatment, speed and remote operation.</span><p class="otherpara">The viability of near IR femto-second LA-ICP-MS analysis of polymer coatings over galvanised steel substrates was demonstrated by Mateo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260</span></sup></a> A low repetition rate was used to ensure that information coming from successive shots was not mixed. The ablation process took place under a helium atmosphere. Results for the three sample types analyzed compared well with those obtained using a GD-OES technique, although the LA-ICP-MS method did achieve a better depth resolution.</p><p class="otherpara">Lopez-Molinero and co-workers developed a novel method of analyte introduction whereby the analyte (Sb) was volatilized from the sample (PET) as a bromide, directly into a FAAS instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit261"><sup><span class="sup_ref">261</span></sup></a> The procedure was optimized using an assortment of techniques including an experimental design process, visual interpretation of 3 dimensional response surfaces and artificial neural networks. Data were compared with those obtained using a standard ICP-OES method and were found to be in good agreement. Using the Sb 217.6 nm line, FAAS was found to give a LOD of 300 ng Sb<small><sup>(V)</sup></small>, a linear range of 1.0 to 17.2 μg and a precision of typically 4.5% RSD.</p><p class="otherpara">Several papers have discussed the relative merits of both sample dissolution and solid sampling. De Schrijver and colleagues compared dissolution and solid sampling techniques for the determination of Ag in polymeric samples by ETAAS, mass spectrometry and X-ray spectrometry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit262"><sup><span class="sup_ref">262</span></sup></a> Two dissolution methods were compared. One was a conventional acid dissolution in a Kjeldahl flask whereas the other was a combination of dry ashing and microwave assisted digestion. The authors concluded that, in general, accurate results were obtained although they did note occasions when Ag was either lost or was decreased when digestion was incomplete. Solid sampling using LA-ICP-MS was found to suffer from problems associated with calibration. Use of a polypropylene sample as a standard was found to produce reliable results for polypropylene samples as well as some other plastic types, as long as the <small><sup>13</sup></small>C ion was used as an internal standard. However, even with use of the internal standard, overestimates were obtained for samples of polyoxymethylene. Calibration problems were also observed during WD-XRF analyses. Accuracy could be improved by use of a matrix correction procedure but, unfortunately, this required accurate knowledge of the matrix prior to analysis. Solid sampling ETAAS proved to be a relatively rapid and reliable technique and could be calibrated using aqueous standards. Use of the 3 field mode Zeeman background correction system was necessary to overcome the background signals and to extend the linear range of calibration. A similar paper by the same research group compared the analysis of polyamide using both solid sampling ETAAS and ETV-ICP-MS with dissolution in formic acid.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> Dissolution using formic acid followed by direct aspiration using a pneumatic nebulization system into the ICP-MS instrument or direct introduction to the ETAAS instrument led to satisfactory precision (6–10% RSD) and to an adequate LOD (0.1–0.6 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) although matrix matching the standards with formic acid was necessary. In contrast, introduction of the solid materials led to an increase in sample throughput, decreased contamination/analyte loss, improved LOD, precision of approximately 10% RSD and, most importantly, accurate results.</p><p class="otherpara">Microwave irradiation has been used by several research groups to bring their sample type into solution. In one simple application (written in Chinese), Wang and co-workers carefully optimized the acid conditions as well as the digestion procedure for the determination of As, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb in acrylonitrile - butadiene - styrene copolymer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> Analysis was by ICP-MS. The authors reported no necessity of matrix matching, impressive LOD (0.7–6.5 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), recoveries in the range 89.8 to 110.8% and precision between 2.8 and 11.3% RSD. An application by Moraes and colleagues described a novel method of sample decomposition in which nitrile-butadiene rubber or ethylenepropylene - diene monomer were combusted in a microwave oven in the presence of oxygen and using 50 μL of 6 M ammonium nitrate as an aid for ignition.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> The analytes Al, Fe, Mn, Sr and Zn were then determined using ICP-OES. Data for Mn and Zn were compared with those obtained using a reference method (ASTM D 4004–06), which is based on dry ashing and FAAS detection of the analytes. Other data were compared with those obtained using a conventional wet digestion in a closed system. The proposed procedure was found to give optimal results (recoveries of 97–101%) when a reflux using 4 M nitric acid for five minutes was used after the combustion. This additional step was required only for Fe. The standard dry ashing method was found to give good results for Zn, but other analytes had a very much reduced recovery (14, 37, 72 and 37% for Al, Fe, Mn and Sr respectively). The proposed procedure yielded a more rapid sample preparation time whilst also avoiding the use of concentrated acids.</p><p class="otherpara">Mateo and co-workers described a near-IR femto-second LA-ICP-MS technique for depth analysis of polymer coated steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260</span></sup></a> A good depth resolution was achieved by modifying the femto-second Gaussian beam to a flat-top beam using a liquid crystal display. A very low repetition rate was used so that there was no mixing of data between successive shots. The depth profiles obtained using the technique were compared with those obtained using GD-OES and were found to be in good agreement. The advantage of the technique was that the depth resolution was much better than for GD-OES, with a resolution of 240 nm being obtained for hot-dipped galvanized steel (compared with 2.2 μm for GD-OES) and of 2.3 μm for a polymer-polymer coated steel (compared with 4.5 μm).</p><p class="otherpara">One final “advance in Analytical Methodology” has been reported.

Included in this number is a paper by Wang and colleagues who prepared charged polystyrene latexes by emulsion polymerization induced by gamma rays.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> The ionic polymerizable surfactants sodium 4-(8-(methacryloyloxy)octyl)benzenesulfonate (MOBS) and methacryloyloxyoctyltrimethylammonium bromide (MOTB) were synthesized and then used as emulsifiers to synthesize the latexes. The products were characterized using TEM and XRF. This synthesis route was considered advantageous compared with initiator-induced emulsion polymerization. Gamma irradiation from <small><sup>60</sup></small>Co has been used by Ferreira and co-workers to prepare polyethylene grafted hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymeric thin films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> The materials, which could have uses in bioapplications, were analyzed using PIXE, AFM and SEM. Although many analytes were found (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ca, Cl, Fe, K, P, S, Si and Zn), their concentrations were sufficiently low so as not to pose any toxicological risk. The AFM and SEM demonstrated the roughness and porosity of the surface of the polymer which is essential for the bio-interaction or cell adhesion. Maiti and Bhowmick reported the preparation of new fluoroelastomer nano-composites from synthetic montmorillonite.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit268"><sup><span class="sup_ref">268</span></sup></a> The montmorillonite-like materials were synthesized in-house because the authors' aim was to understand the structure-property relationships.

The materials were also characterized in terms of their mechanical, dynamic mechanical, swelling and thermal properties. It was found that the synthetic materials showed improved properties when compared with those made using the natural materials.</span></div><div><span id="sect1747"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.4 Other applications. </span><span>A simple application in which the amount of Sb leached from polyethylene terephthalate oven proof trays used for ready-to-eat meals was reported by Haldimann and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> The Sb, which is present as a result of the use of a polycondensation catalyst, could potentially leach into the food and become a health hazard.

On cooking in either microwave or conventional ovens, the amount of antimony in the foodstuffs increased significantly, with the range found in food being 0–17 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the range in ready meals being 8–38 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. It was found that approximately half of the food prepared at 180°C exceeded the specific migration limit set for food contact material by the European Commission.

Once the circuit boards are redundant, they must be re-cycled to re-claim as much of the toxic materials as possible. Alternatively, some of the chemicals used are of very high purity and hence high cost. These materials are also re-claimed since it helps lower the overall cost of production. There have been several papers in this subject area published during this review period. The recovery of high purity copper cathodes from printed circuit boards using either ammoniacal sulfate or chloride solutions has been discussed by Oishi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit278"><sup><span class="sup_ref">278</span></sup></a> Leaching of the waste PCBs was achieved using copper (II) ammine as oxidizing agent which selectively dissolved the Cu giving a concentration of 40–50 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the final solution. Other materials dissolved included Zn (at 1 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and Mn and Pb (both at ∼ 0.1 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). The solution was then purified by solvent extraction using alkyl substituted 8-hydroxyquinoline, which managed to remove &gt; 95% of the impurities, but with a few exceptions. Leaching of the PCBs with a sulfate solution led to higher selectivity for the Cu than did leaching with chloride-based reagents. Copper was recovered from the solutions by electro-deposition. The power required for the electro-deposition was also dependent on the leaching system used, with 1300 kWh required for the deposition of 1 tonne of Cu from the sulfate system and 500 kWh required for the chloride-based system. Analysis of the recovered material using GD-MS indicated that impurities totaled 24 ppm for the sulfate system and 1 ppm for the chloride system, with Pb being the main contaminant in both.

If the thickness is greater than this, then measures must be taken to eliminate the silicon matrix. The authors described an improved heating pre-treatment approach that successfully achieved this. For the GFAAS analysis, the presence of the silicon can create interferences during the determination of Al and Na. Addition of nitric acid to the graphite tube after sample injection was also found to decrease the silicon interference.

Method validation was achieved by the analysis of older CRM materials of silicon metal (NIST 57 and NIST 57a) and also by analysis of the candidate reference material NIST 57b.

A wet chemical procedure was performed to dissolve layers prior to ICP-OES and ICP-MS analysis to determine the stoichiometry of the silver selenide. The results indicated that a correlation between the composition of the layers and their thickness existed, with silver enriched layers being generally thinner than those that were silver deplete.

When both Ni and Co were present in the magnetic layer, the composition of the samples was influenced by the anomalous co-deposition properties of the iron-group elements and the mass transport of the corresponding ions in the electrolyte. The authors concluded that there was possible inhomogeneity of the magnetic layers in the electro-deposited sample.

It was found that the un-doped zinc sulfide film exhibited n-type behaviour whereas the Ag - doped materials exhibited p-type behaviour. In addition, the band gap in the doped material was increased when compared with the un-doped material annealed under the same conditions. The results were attributed to the migration of Ag through both the grain boundaries and intra-grain accompanied by interaction with native point defects.</p><p class="otherpara">Lloyd gave a good account of the relative merits of the use of multivariate statistical analysis for improving data obtained from ToF-SIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> In the paper, she discussed how SEM can visualize buried defects but that the chemical characterization of these defects can be complex or difficult. The technique of ToF-SIMS is, however, capable of depth-profiling because it has the ability to spatially resolve depth profiles while collecting an entire mass spectrum at every “voxel” (a portmanteau of the words pixel and volume). The technique can therefore produce a vast amount of data which, depending on the sample size, can become unmanageable. Use of multivariate statistics can reduce this amount of data to a small set of chemically meaningful factors. Data scaling is important in such applications and a comparison of scaling procedures was made.

The data using positive atomic ion detection obtained prior to heat treatment showed some anomalous Ti distribution behaviour.

Depth-profiling of the materials using XPS indicated a different distribution of Pd and Ti in the annealed titanium deuteride - palladium film compared with the annealed titanium - palladium one. A mechanism for the transformation was deduced, which involved the thermal decomposition of the titanium deuteride which, in turn, led to a modification of the inter-mixing process. In the other paper of this type, Mertens and co-workers determined the effects of a rapid thermal annealing process on thin boron - niobium and boron - niobium nitride bilayers and niobium - boron - niobium trilayers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit318"><sup><span class="sup_ref">318</span></sup></a> The films (of approximately 500 nm total thickness) were deposited on silicon (100) wafers with the Nb and B layers being deposited by magnetron sputtering and the Nb<small><sub>2</sub></small>N layers being prepared by nitridation of Nb films.

Using the techniques of XRD, SEM, AFM and SIMS, the surface morphology and roughness as well as the chemical composition were studied.

At lower temperatures, the high oxygen content in the boron layer hindered the formation of borides because of the formation of glass-like oxides.

The latter technique also enabled a depth-profile/3-dimensional chemical imaging of the sample. The materials were tested as electron conductors in hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells. Unfortunately, the removal of the silica network led to collapse of the cadmium selenide structure and the formation of a high pin-hole density. Consequently, this led to poor photo-voltaic properties. The intercalation of lithium ions in vanadium pentoxide leads to a change in optical properties, a process that is of value on thin film electrochemical devices. A study by Alamarguy and co-workers deposited the vanadium pentoxide on indium tin oxide glass coupons using a sol-gel process and then challenged it using increasing amounts of charge - discharge cycles ranging from 72 to 589 full cycles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit320"><sup><span class="sup_ref">320</span></sup></a> The samples were then washed.

It was noted that the overall Li concentration was similar for all the samples analyzed and that there was a notable build-up at the interface between the vanadium pentoxide and the indium tin oxide glass substrate.

The authors attempted to form xerogel standards for a range of transition elements as well as the Se, but this proved unsuccessful since visible heterogeneities (inclusions) resulted.

Included in this number is a paper by Hiratat and Kon,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit336"><sup><span class="sup_ref">336</span></sup></a> who used a titanium–sapphire laser that operated in the near IR region of the spectrum. The signal intensity from <small><sup>57</sup></small>Fe obtained from iron sulfide was almost four times higher than that obtained using an ArF excimer laser for ablations under similar energy fluence (5 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>). In addition, the femtosecond laser produced craters that were similar in dimension and depth irrespective of whether the material was a glass or a zircon material. This was not the case for the excimer laser where the crater formed in a zircon was half the depth of the one formed in a glass material. Thermal induced and particle-size related elemental fractionation was also compared for the two laser systems. The conventional excimer laser produced greater ratios of <small><sup>206</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U and <small><sup>238</sup></small>U/<small><sup>232</sup></small>Th, indicating a higher level of elemental fractionation; a source of analytical error.

The influence of repetition rate (1–1000Hz) and scan speed (1–200 μm s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) using a low energy (30 μJ) and a small spot size (10 μm) femtosecond UV laser was evaluated for the analysis of silica glass samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit337"><sup><span class="sup_ref">337</span></sup></a> A precision of 6% RSD was obtained whilst accuracy was less impressive, with 14% error observed.

SEM imaging demonstrated that the particles produced by the nanosecond laser were larger and that there were more of them. These authors found that there was no correlation between particle size and median major element concentration for the alloy sample, which is in contrast to the results obtained previously and to those obtained by Hiratat and Kon. However, Gonzalez and colleagues also noticed clear differences in particle size, crater depth, heat affected zone and ICP-MS response between the glass and alloy samples, with the glass particles being larger but the craters being less deep and damage to the sample being less pronounced than for the alloy sample.

There have been several relevant applications published during this review period. Burakov and co-workers have published two papers in this research area over the period. The first described a method by which alloys and glasses could be analyzed yielding accurate and precise data without recourse to calibration curves, CRMs or internal standards.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit339"><sup><span class="sup_ref">339</span></sup></a> Since the ablated mass of sample is minimal, the technique is generally regarded as being non-destructive and hence has use in the archaeological field. In this paper, Burakov and Raikov analyzed brass, bronze and gold alloys, glasses and archaeological samples. In a second paper, Burakov <span class="italic">et al.</span> characterized the laser induced plasma from a glass sample using both single and a collinear double pulse excitation regimes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit340"><sup><span class="sup_ref">340</span></sup></a> The detection system enabled spatial, temporal and spectral measurements to be obtained. The experiments indicated that the two systems produced very different results with the signal being enhanced in the double pulse system. This enhancement was, however, found to be spatially dependent and to differ for different elements. An optical micro-lens array for laser plasma generation and spectrochemical analysis has been developed by Sturm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit341"><sup><span class="sup_ref">341</span></sup></a> A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm was focused by the micro-lens array to form a plasma on silicate glass targets. The output energy of the laser was 200 mJ, the pulse duration was 8 ns and the repetition rate was 10 Hz. The overall result was that 47 ablation spots could be obtained within an area of 9 mm diameter. The micro-lens array enabled a reduction in the variation of spectral line emission (Ca and Si lines) compared with the use of a single lens to focus the light. The author associated this reduction in variation with the averaging effect of the micro-lens array. Carmona and colleagues reported the determination of Pb in assorted glass samples including sonorous glass (10% PbO), crystal glass (at least 24% PbO) and superior crystal glass (at least 30% PbO).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit342"><sup><span class="sup_ref">342</span></sup></a> The glass samples were artificially weathered using neutral, alkaline and acidic solutions. The bulk composition of the samples was determined using XRF and the surfaces of the samples were analyzed using LIBS and by SEM-EDX. For the LIBS analysis, a linear correlation between intensity of Pb emission lines and the PbO content was established. It was found that acid attack on the glasses led to a decrease of PbO, CaO and Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>O at the surface with respect to the bulk sample whereas alkaline attack produced only minor changes in composition. The authors concluded that LIBS could be used to assess both the degree and the type of corrosion that a glass sample had undergone.</span><p class="otherpara">One somewhat less successful application of LIBS was reported by Bridge <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit343"><sup><span class="sup_ref">343</span></sup></a> These authors used LIBS in conjunction with refractive index (RI) data and compared the analysis with LA-ICP-MS and RI for the forensic discrimination of several glass types including float glass from front and side automobile windows, car headlamp glass, side mirror glass and brown beverage container glass. The largest overall discrimination was obtained using LA-ICP-MS and RI, where 98.8% of 666 samples were identified. Unfortunately, the combination of LIBS and RI data gave a successful discrimination in only 87.2% of 1122 samples. The problem was associated with side mirror glass, where LIBS had a large variance in emission intensity leading to poor discrimination. The same problem was not observed for the LA-ICP-MS analyses.</p></div><div><span id="sect2263"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.3.4 Forensic analyses. </span><span>In addition to the paper by Bridge <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit343"><sup><span class="sup_ref">343</span></sup></a> there have been four other forensic applications of the analysis of glass. Coumbaros and co-workers commented that RI data alone is insufficient to discriminate between different float glasses since, in Australia, the values of RI lie between 1.5189 and 1.5194.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit344"><sup><span class="sup_ref">344</span></sup></a> Hence, it is necessary to complement RI data with instrumental chemical analysis. In their paper, they described the use of ToF-SIMS for the analysis of the three-dimensional homogeneity of a sheet of float glass. A variation in the concentrations of Ca, Mg, Na and Si immediately under the non-float surface was observed and this was found to correlate with a decrease in RI value. Nakanishi and colleagues described the use of synchrotron radiation high energy XRF for the analysis of glass fragments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit345"><sup><span class="sup_ref">345</span></sup></a> The use of such a facility decreased LOD to picogram levels for some analytes and to tens of picograms for others. Analysis of NIST 612 enabled the k-line peaks of 31 elements to be obtained, with precision being better than 9.7% RSD for all except Ca. The technique was applied to the determination of Ce, Hf, La, Pb, Rb, Sr and Zr in fragments of sheet glass. Detection limits were sufficiently low to enable the use of these analytes to characterize the glass samples. The authors concluded that the technique was an effective approach to the non-destructive discrimination of small fragments of glass and was therefore applicable to forensic science.</span><p class="otherpara">The other two relevant papers have been written in Japanese, but are interesting applications. In one, Ito and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit346"><sup><span class="sup_ref">346</span></sup></a> used LA-ICP-MS to determine Ba, Ce, Co, La, Rb, Sr and Zr impurities in glass. Using a Nd:YAG laser operating at 213 nm, the authors analyzed 16 sheets of glass produced by three different manufacturers. The results from the LA-ICP-MS procedure were in good agreement with those obtained using conventional solution nebulization ICP-MS following an acid digestion. The sample preparation time for the LA-ICP-MS was, however, very much reduced in comparison. In the other application, the forensic discrimination between heated and non-heated sheet glass by the analysis of trace impurities using SR-XRF was reported by Kasamatsu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit347"><sup><span class="sup_ref">347</span></sup></a> Five sheets of glass from three manufacturers were split into two groups; one of which was heated to 760°C for two minutes and the other remained at room temperature. Both groups of glasses were then analyzed using RI and SR-XRF. All of the heated glasses had a lower RI than those of the non-heated ones. The concentrations of Ba, Ce, La, Rb, Sr and Zr were found to be considerably different among the different non-heated glasses, but that there was no significant difference between the ratios of Sr k-alpha/Rb k-alpha, Zr k-beta/Rb k-alpha, Ba k-alpha/Ce k-alpha and La k-alpha/Ce k-alpha between heated and non-heated glasses.</p></div><div><span id="sect2275"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.3.5 Nuclear glasses. </span><span>The results of two studies of nuclear glasses have been published. In one Peuget and co-workers determined the effect of alpha radiation on the leaching behavior of nuclear glasses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit348"><sup><span class="sup_ref">348</span></sup></a> Various samples of glass R7T7 were doped with Np-237, Pu-238, Pu-239, Am-241 or Cm-244, with the content of each actinide adjusted to cover a range of alpha activity varying from 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>11</sup></small> Bq g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and alpha decay doses of up to 4 × 10<small><sup>18</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

It was found that the neither the alpha activity nor the decay dose had a significant impact on the leaching behavior of the glass. In a similar paper by the same group, solid state diffusion in the nuclear glass R7T7 was studied.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit349"><sup><span class="sup_ref">349</span></sup></a> The material, which has been selected as a nuclear containment material in France, has a very low long term alteration rate that remains constant (or slightly reduces) over time. The alteration rate never reaches zero and even though the rate is 5 nm per year at 323K, over a geological time scale, this could prove problematic. The authors proposed two mechanisms to explain this diffusion: diffusion through an amorphous altered layer and the precipitation of neo-formed layers. The effects of pH, temperature, ionic strength and surface to volume ratio of the surrounding solution were all determined, using ICP-OES to analyze the liquid phase and ToF-SIMS to depth profile the glass itself. Surface to volume ratio and ionic strength were found not to be significant factors in the diffusion, whereas pH leads to a significant decrease in diffusion at 323K when it is raised from 8 to 10.</span></div><div><span id="sect2286"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.3.6 Archaeological studies. </span><span>Although particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) is a technique not normally covered in ASU reviews, it is perhaps worth mentioning an article by Calligaro entitled “PIXE in the study of archaeological and historical glasses”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit350"><sup><span class="sup_ref">350</span></sup></a> The author presented two case studies in which the elucidation of ancient glass recipes, determination of provenance of raw materials and the weathering processes were all studied.

There have, however, been several reports of new methods of analysis for established ceramic materials. For the archaeological samples, it has been the norm to cause as little damage as possible and hence methods of direct solids analysis that leave the material intact have, as usual, been popular. Techniques such as LA, XRF or even LIBS are the most common. Over the last few years, there has also been an increasing trend to use chemometric analysis of the analytical data to try and glean as much information as possible; <span class="italic">e.g.</span> to establish the provenance of samples, detection of forgeries etc. This trend has continued in this review period.</span><div><span id="sect2297"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.1 Methods of analysis. </span><span>Many ceramics are very refractory and can therefore be difficult to bring into solution for analysis. As a result, there has been a trend over many years to analyze the samples directly, i.e. the solid form. This trend has continued during this review period. One of the more commonly used methods of direct solids analysis has proved to be LIBS, with several applications to the analysis of ceramics being reported. In one application, Ctvrtnickova <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit367"><sup><span class="sup_ref">367</span></sup></a> compared the use of single and double pulse LIBS for the analysis of pressed pellets of powdered samples of silicate raw materials for the brick and tile industry. The parameters compared included the precision, sensitivity and LOD; with operating conditions such as laser pulse energy and inter-pulse separation being optimised. Two Nd:YAG lasers operating at 1064 and 532 nm in an orthogonal configuration with a re-heating arrangement were employed. Under optimised conditions the LOD obtained for Mg and Si using the double pulse technique were 10 times better than for single pulse. Killinger and co-workers found that the emission obtained from an alumina target irradiated by a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm was enhanced by the use of a 10.64 μm carbon dioxide laser.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit368"><sup><span class="sup_ref">368</span></sup></a> The level of enhancement was dependent on the individual analytical line, but was in the region of between 25 and 300 times. The output energy of the Nd:YAG laser was 50 mJ/pulse and the beam was focussed to a spot size of 1 mm diameter. The carbon dioxide laser had an output of 40 mJ/mm. The authors found that the enhancement effect of the carbon dioxide laser was critical on the two laser pulses being within 1 ms of each other. Of note in this paper was the observation that different ionization states and different elemental species produced a different level of signal enhancement. Both tungsten carbide hard metal pre-cursors and cemented tungsten carbide powders were analyzed using LIBS by Novotny and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit369"><sup><span class="sup_ref">369</span></sup></a> The samples were pressed using a hydraulic press to form a pellet using powdered silver as a binder. The cemented tungsten carbide was embedded in resin for easier manipulation. A wide variety of operating conditions were tested, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> different lasers, (Nd:YAG operating at 1064 nm and 266 nm, argon fluoride at 193 nm and krypton fluoride at 248 nm); different surrounding gases (air, helium and argon) and different detectors. The authors finally employed the argon fluoride and krypton fluoride lasers in air to determine Co, Nb, Ta and Ti in the samples. Although reasonable calibration curves (r<small><sup>2</sup></small> &gt; 0.96) were obtained for Nb, Ta and Ti, the Co proved problematic with a regression of only 0.7994 being obtained for the cemented samples and calibration being unobtainable for the pre-cursor samples. Another interesting LIBS application was conducted by Das <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used the technique for a depth-profiling study of a thermal barrier coated superalloy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit370"><sup><span class="sup_ref">370</span></sup></a> The thermal barrier coating consisted of a 7% yttria stabilised zirconia ceramic and an inner platinum-modified bond coat on a nickel-based superalloy single crystal substrate. In the presence of the ceramic it was possible to determine the ceramic/bond coat interface from the spectral profile of Al. In the absence of the ceramic, the spectral profile of W could be used to identify the interface of the bond coat and the substrate and also between the two layers of the bond coat.</span><p class="otherpara">There have been several other applications that have described the different methods of sample analysis. In this group is a method reported by Peschel <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used the radionuclides <small><sup>51</sup></small>Cr, <small><sup>59</sup></small>Fe, <small><sup>60</sup></small>Co and <small><sup>65</sup></small>Zn to study the influence of thermochemical reagents on the volatilisation and transport efficiency from slurries of alumina during analysis using ETV-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit371"><sup><span class="sup_ref">371</span></sup></a> The alumina powder (NIST 699) was introduced to the ETV device and then, after volatilisation at 2200°C, only 2% of the analytes were found to be retained, even without the additional use of thermochemical reagents. Placement of filters on the end of the transport tube indicated that recovery of the analytes was approximately 10% but that this increased to over 20% in the presence of palladium chloride, a mixture of palladium nitrate and magnesium nitrate, palladium chloride, iridium chloride, tin chloride, silver chloride, sodium fluoride, ammonium chloride or ammonium fluoride. However, this increase in analyte transport efficiency was found to be dependent on the concentration of the reagents; with normal concentrations used for volatilisation yielding the increase in transport efficiency but elevated concentrations actually causing a decrease. This was especially true for silver chloride, iridium chloride and the palladium chloride. Barth and co-workers described two methods for the determination of Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Si, Ti and Zr in four boron nitride materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit372"><sup><span class="sup_ref">372</span></sup></a> The first of these methods involved the direct solids introduction to GFAAS. For this, the platform was covered with graphite powder prior to weighing the sample aliquot onto it. For the Si determination, it was also necessary to use a palladium/magnesium nitrate modifier. The other method described was ETV-ICP-OES. Again, this was a direct solid sampling approach, but utilised Freon R12 as a volatilisation aid. Detection limits were impressive and lied within the range 5 (for Cu) to 130 (for Si) ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the GFAAS measurements and between 8 (for Cu) and 200 (for Si) ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for ETV-ICP-OES.

The authors adjusted the temperature programmes accordingly so that the volatile analytes could be determined without interference and to prolong the useful lifetime of the graphite tube. Calibration was achieved using aqueous standard additions to the powders. The authors also discovered that linear range could be extended by two orders of magnitude if Zeeman background correction was used. Very low LOD of 2.1, 0.27, 24, 3.9, 6.3 and 0.9 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were reported for As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb and Zn respectively.

For the solid homogenization procedure, TXRF yielded precise (0.8–27% RSD depending on the analyte and concentration) and accurate (91–110% recovery) data. Overall, 15 elements were determined. For the solid sedimentation procedure, problems arising through the different particle sizes of the sample were found to be negligible for most analytes, but for three elements (As, Sr and Zn), problems were noted.

Zhang and co-workers have reported a novel technique to synthesise hydroxyapatite whiskers with high crystallinity, uniform morphology and with a high aspect ratio.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit394"><sup><span class="sup_ref">394</span></sup></a> Using the reflux - hydrothermal combined method of preparation the authors determined the effects of the additives urea, citric acid and disodium EDTA as additives on the characteristics of the hydroxyapatite whiskers. Analytical techniques such as XRD, FTIR, SEM and ICP-OES were used for the characterization. It was found that the combined reflux - hydrothermal preparation method created larger aspect ratios, more uniform morphology, more pure phase compositions, had a shorter reaction time and used more mild conditions than either the reflux or the hydrothermal methods on their own. Urea was found to have the greatest effect on the material's characteristics. Structural characterization of Zn-substituted hydroxyapatite prepared by the hydrothermal method was reported by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit395"><sup><span class="sup_ref">395</span></sup></a> These authors used XRF, XRD, FTIR and TEM for the characterization of the crystalline phase, microstructure, chemical composition, morphology and thermal stability. Results indicated that Zn-hydroxyapatite had a greater Zn substitution content when it was prepared using sodium hydroxide rather than ammonia solution. In addition, substitution of Zn for Ca caused a lower crystallinity and changed the lattice parameters since the ionic radius is smaller for Zn (0.074 nm) than for Ca (0.099 nm). Thermal stability also differed depending on the preparation conditions, with Zn-hydroxyapatite prepared using ammonia solution starting to decompose at 800°C when the Zn fraction increased to 15 mol %, whereas that prepared in sodium hydroxide solution started to decompose at only 5 mol% Zn. The electrochemical and structural characteristics of yttria stabilised zirconia/hydroxyapatite composite coatings on surgical-grade stainless steel were investigated by Balamurugan and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit396"><sup><span class="sup_ref">396</span></sup></a> The materials, which were a product of sol-gel dip coating and calcinations, varied in molar ratio of hydroxyapatite and yttria stabilised zirconia, but all had an average particle size of 30 nm. Techniques such as FTIR, XRD and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) were used during the structural characterization. The extent of corrosion of the materials in simulated body fluids was determined using IC-OES.

The authors observed that the product contained numerous bone-like features, including a lack of OH, nanometer size, low crystallinity, etc. and therefore concluded that the amorphous precursor appeared to be the essential step for the transition to occur.</span></div><h3 id="sect2479"><span class="b_heading">3.5 Catalysts</span></h3><span>For the purposes of this review catalysts and catalyst function have been broadly categorised as follows: novel materials, hydrogen evolution reactions, hydrogenation reactions, oxidation and desulfurisation, NO<small><sub>x</sub></small> reductions and Perovskite catalysts, Fischer Tropsch reactions, ionic liquids as acid catalysts in organic synthesis and photocatalysts. Ionic liquids are a new addition to this review and there are several papers which outlined their applications and analysis. The reviewer predicts that their unique properties, coupled with sound environmental credentials, mean that they will become increasingly important in the field of catalysis. In addition, there is a short section outlining papers which address the recurring theme of catalyst deactivation by coke formation. Many of the papers in this review period deal primarily with the synthesis of catalysts and the investigation of their catalytic activity, with characterization by spectroscopic and physico-chemical techniques being described in brief. This review therefore concentrates on the broader field of catalyst preparation and characterization, but the first section considers papers which do have a significant analytical content, particularly XAFS and XANES techniques for the elucidation of atomic structures, valence state and coordination numbers of the catalytic materials and SIMS techniques for surface analysis of materials.</span><div><span id="sect2484"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.1 Methods of analysis. </span><span>In addition to the methods mentioned above, one paper on cavity ringdown spectroscopy is also reviewed.

Nano-structured materials with different support characteristics are of interest in a wide range of catalytic applications including low-temperature catalytic combustion, partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, hydrogenation of carbon oxides, unsaturated hydrocarbons and reduction of NO, etc. For nanoparticles, support materials play an important role by providing a high reactive surface area, thermal stability, higher dispersion of nano-metallic particles, longer catalyst life and a structure sensitive base. For development of good nanocatalytic materials, the structures and environment of nanoparticles are critical and it is very important that the nanoparticles are properly stabilised in the support matrix. Bhargava <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit399"><sup><span class="sup_ref">399</span></sup></a> and references therein have reported that gold particles active in particular forms, environments, size ranges and distributions will catalyse certain types of reactions including oxidation, hydrogenation and hydrochlorination reactions with most being noticeably structure sensitive over supported gold catalysts. Supported nano-gold catalysts are typically used in the low-temperature, catalytic combustion and partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, hydrogenation of carbon oxides and unsaturated hydrocarbons and reduction of nitric oxide. Nano-gold catalysts provide fast reaction rates, high selectivity, and low reaction temperature. This paper described a predominantly XAFS investigation of the structural properties of gold nanoparticles supported on different rare earth oxide (europium, dysprosium, samarium oxide, neodymium, gadolinium oxide, lanthanum) support materials. High purity europium, dysprosium, samarium oxide, neodymium, gadolinium oxide and lanthanum oxide materials containing various loading of gold nanoparticles were prepared by a range of methods. High-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was utilised for investigating the atomic and molecular structures of supported nanoparticles on rare earth materials in order to elucidate variations in the local environment and structure around the gold atom. A range of data is presented, including atomic distances and Debye–Waller factor of gold nanoparticles supported on different rare earth oxide materials and these data, together with TEM and XANES data are discussed in detail. Platinum catalysts are excellent methanol oxidation catalysts and are used in direct methanol fuel cells. They are, however, susceptible to poisoning by CO whereas the PtRu alloys have been shown to exhibit a high tolerance to CO poisoning. Nitani <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit400"><sup><span class="sup_ref">400</span></sup></a> have employed XAFS to examine the atomic substructure, and other techniques to study PtRu nanoparticles supported on carbon for direct methanol fuel cells. The results from the analysis indicated a platinum rich core and a ruthenium rich shell. The coordination numbers were determined by XAFS and clear correlation was found between catalytic activity and Pt-Ru atomic pair frequency occurring on the catalyst surface. Sacaliuc and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit401"><sup><span class="sup_ref">401</span></sup></a> have reported the use of EXAFS and XANES in studies of highly dispersed gold nanoparticles in a Ti-SBA-15 mesoporous support. Detailed description of the results from these techniques and their use in establishing information on the characteristics of the gold and titanium particles was presented. Differences in catalytic activity have been attributed to the dispersion of titanium in the support and to the gold nanoparticle size.</p><p class="otherpara">Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy is increasingly being used for environmental particle analysis as well as for characterization of nano-materials. X-ray beam sizes of the order of 50–500 nm are currently used at state-of-the-art synchrotron facilities for performing this type of trace-level analysis. Kawai and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit402"><sup><span class="sup_ref">402</span></sup></a> described the analysis of individual micrometer size particles of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photocatalyst by SR-XRF and SEM. Electron beam excited and synchrotron radiation induced X-ray emission spectra of the same yellow sand single particles are reported and compared. The Ti-K edge absorption fine structure of single microparticles of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (rutile, anatase and a photocatalyst aerosol) were recorded by using monochromatic synchrotron radiation of tunable energy. The authors have shown that discrimination between rutile and anatase is possible. Based on the single particle speciation, the toxicity of photocatalyst aerosol powder was discussed. Three-way type automotive catalytic converters (ACCs), which deal with the three most important pollutants in vehicle exhaust (CO, NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>, and unburned or partially burned hydrocarbons), are usually based on a honeycomb monolith made of cordierite (2MgO·2Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>·5SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>). This material is wash coated with a mixture of alumina, CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, precious metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) and Ba- or La-oxides. The precious metals are the most important components of the ACCs, since the catalytic activity occurs at the precious metal centre. It is generally agreed that Rh promotes the NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> dissociation, while Pt and Pd promote the oxidation reaction. It is important to be able to quantify precious metals in catalysts which are recycled but there are few papers detailing the quantitation of these metals in ACCs. A fast and direct determination procedure for precious metals in spent automotive catalyst has now been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit403"><sup><span class="sup_ref">403</span></sup></a> Van Meel <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the use of high-energy polarized-beam XRF to determine platinum group metals (PGM) in ACCs. A sample preparation method working directly on material which had been ground was optimized. The primary goal was to obtain a fast method with as simple a sample preparation procedure as possible, without losing analytical performance compared with ICP-OES. EDXRF has the benefit of (in most cases) easy sample preparation and multi-element capabilities. When using a high-energy polarizing-beam EDXRF (HE-P-EDXRF) equipped with secondary targets, additional benefits include low background and better excitation of heavy elements. In this work, a method was developed to analyze the ACC in the form of pressed powder pellets using HE-P-EDXRF equipment. For the sake of simplicity of sample preparation, no internal standard was added and Compton correction for matrix effects was used. The accuracy was established by comparing the results of the analysis of many samples with a highly validated ICP-OES technique. A 2-sided t-test at the 95% confidence level confirmed the data were equivalent to the results from the validated ICP technique and 3σ detection limits were in the single figure ppm range. TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalysts are important photocatalysts but are only around 3% efficient. Their efficiency can be increased by doping with V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, C, N or S atoms. The photocatalytic role of vanadium doped in mesoporous TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> has not been clarified and Izumi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit404"><sup><span class="sup_ref">404</span></sup></a> described valence state-sensitive XAFS as a means to monitor the V sites in mesoporous TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for ethanol dehydration under equilibrium <span class="italic">in-situ</span> conditions and visible light-illumination. The feasibility of discriminating V<small><sup>IV</sup></small> sites from a 1:1 physical mixture of standard V<small><sup>IV</sup></small> and V<small><sup>V</sup></small> inorganic compounds was demonstrated. The chemical shift between V<small><sup>IV</sup></small> and V<small><sup>V</sup></small> sites was 1.0 eV. The redox states for ethanol dehydration over mesoporous TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> excited in visible light were suggested to be V<small><sup>III</sup></small> and V<small><sup>IV</sup></small>. The chemical shift between valence states V<small><sup>III</sup></small> and V<small><sup>IV</sup></small> was greater (3.2 eV). On the basis of V K<small><sup>ß</sup></small><small><sub>5,2</sub></small> emission and V K<small><sup>ß</sup></small><small><sub>5,2</sub></small>-selecting XAFS spectra tuned to the V K<small><sup>ß</sup></small><small><sub>5,2</sub></small> peak, the authors determined that the fresh mesoporous V-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalyst has a valence state of V<small><sup>IV</sup></small>. The vanadium sites were partially reduced by the dissociative adsorption of ethanol under visible light, but they stayed within the emission-energy ranges for standard V<small><sup>IV</sup></small> compounds. These partially reduced vanadium sites were reoxidized in oxygen under visible light. Finally, direct XAFS observation of photo-reduced V<small><sup>III</sup></small> sites was attempted by tuning the spectrometer to 5456.3 eV for partially reduced mesoporous V-TiO<small><sub>2.</sub></small>. Valence state V<small><sup>III</sup></small> was selected for 60% of the spectrum in the mixture of V<small><sup>III</sup></small> (minor) and V<small><sup>IV</sup></small> (dominant) valence states. The minimisation of interferences prior to the determination of noble metals in geological samples by conventional elemental analysis techniques including ICP-MS and ETAAS is important to achieve the required levels of accuracy and sufficiently low detection limits. Myasoedova <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit398"><sup><span class="sup_ref">398</span></sup></a> presented a review of available sorbents used for the preconcentration of noble metals in geological matrices, together with a description of the major instrumental features used for their determination after preconcentration. One of the most commonly used catalyst supports, particularly in the oil and petrochemical industries, is amorphous alumina, owing to its physical, thermal and chemical properties. These catalysts are largely applied for isomerization of olefins, paraffin, alkyl aromatics, alkylation of aromatics with alcohols, olefins oligomerization and catalytic cracking. However, catalyst deactivation is a problem in many industrial catalytic processes. Deactivation can occur by a number of different chemical and physical mechanisms, which are commonly divided into four classes: i) poisoning, ii) coking or fouling, iii) sintering and iv) phase transformation. Other mechanisms of deactivation include masking and loss of the active elements <span class="italic">via</span> volatilization, erosion and attrition. The presence of trace elements, such as Cd, Pb and Cu among others, in catalysts can affect their performance and the quality of products. Although limited information about the effect of trace contaminants on catalysts is available, some studies have indicated that even small amounts of these contaminants deposited onto the catalyst surface may cause strong chemisorption on the active sites resulting in significant loss of catalytic activity. Trace elements in digests of alumina based materials have been determined by various techniques including GFAAS, ICP-OES and ICP-MS. However, the sample preparation step can introduce serious limitations in the analytical performance of these techniques mainly because of contamination, the time required and difficulties in sample digestion. Rodrigues and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit405"><sup><span class="sup_ref">405</span></sup></a> reported that direct solid sampling GFAAS can offer several advantages, especially when it is applied for the analysis of high purity materials. Potential advantages include the low risk of contamination, small sample mass requirement, no or only very little reagent consumption and low LOD (generally &lt; 1 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). This technique has already been successfully applied for trace element determination in materials that are particularly difficult to digest, such as zirconium, niobium, and aluminum oxide powders (see references therein). The authors reported on the effects of the various experimental parameters including pyrolysis conditions and sample mass and suggest that several elements in alumina based materials could be quantified using aqueous standards. Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has been applied to the investigation of the deactivation processes of hydrochlorination catalysts by Grams <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit406"><sup><span class="sup_ref">406</span></sup></a> A model catalyst of palladium on alumina was used in these studies and ToF-SIMS was able to monitor various parameters associated with catalyst deactivation simultaneously. This technique was employed primarily as it yields surface information which is complementary to other techniques, particularly XPS, XRD, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), TEM and SEM. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the suitability of ToF-SIMS to investigate the catalyst surface and establish the reasons for its deactivation during hydrodechlorination. Pd on alumina is widely used as a catalyst for removal of chlorine from halogenated substances which may be damaging to the environment. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to deactivation. In this work the reasons for this deactivation were investigated and found to be several fold, including a significant deposition of chlorine on the surface. The chlorine was shown by ToF-SIMS to be present as Pd-Cl bonds on the active surface and was demonstrated to be in the form of PdCl<small><sup>−</sup></small> and PdCl<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small>. A quantitative comparison of fresh and used catalyst showed that there was a significant increase in these species in the used catalyst. This was also accompanied by a significant reduction in the surface accessible Pd and a decrease in surface area of the catalyst. ToF-SIMS surface images are shown in this paper and allow a visual observation as well as a quantitative analysis of the deterioration of the catalyst. Zinc oxide
nanowires are expected to make a significant impact in optoelectronics because of the wide band gap and high exciton energy of this material. The catalyst and growth mechanism have been found to play an important role in the orientation, dimensions and defect density of the nanowires. The effect that the catalyst and its residue will have on the electrical properties of the zinc oxide nanowire is unknown but it is likely to have a significant impact. Morris and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit407"><sup><span class="sup_ref">407</span></sup></a> have employed SIMS depth profiling analysis for the spatial determination of gold residue in these nanowires, together with EDXRF and SEM. 500eV caesium near surface mass spectra were obtained and typical depth profiles from the nanowire materials were shown. These results showed the distribution of Au through the nanowire and the authors were able to propose an alternate growth mechanism (vapour-solid mechanism) to the anticipated vapour-liquid-solid growth mechanism. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are promising power sources for many applications requiring high power and long operating times. Several prototype systems have been developed although there are issues with long term durability of the membrane electrode assembly. Pt-Ru alloys are thought to be the most practical anode materials for these applications due to favourable catalytic activity, though their activity is strongly dependent on the composition, structure, morphology and particle size. Gyeong-Su Park <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit408"><sup><span class="sup_ref">408</span></sup></a> described the use of high resolution TEM, XPS and ToF-SIMS for the study of the durability of Pt-Ru anode catalysts under DMFC operating conditions. Beautiful images, particularly ToF-SIMS mapping images of Ru in the cathode materials, are presented in this paper. EDS results on the cathodes did not reveal the presence of ruthenium but the SIMS images did show clear evidence of Ru crossover through the decomposition of the Pt-Ru catalysts. This was clearly illustrated by the Ru accumulation at the cathode surface and this was related linearly with the performance drop. Platinum crossover from the anode was also demonstrated, and associated morphological changes of the Pt-Ru particles. This was also correlated to performance drop. Johansson <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit409"><sup><span class="sup_ref">409</span></sup></a> have demonstrated the use of cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) to probe reaction intermediates desorbing from the surface during a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. In understanding catalysis and combustion, intermediates play a critical role in the overall description of reaction paths, elementary reaction rates and soot formation. Many such processes, including soot formation, involve radicals and small molecules. The radicals are often very reactive and short-lived and, therefore, exist in low concentrations, which makes them difficult to detect and quantify. The development of laser spectroscopic techniques has opened new opportunities to probe such molecules. The OH radical is, in general, an important intermediate in combustion, and is also crucial in catalytic water formation from hydrogen and oxygen. The OH molecules are formed on the catalytic surface and rapidly react to form water. Hydrogen fuel cells use hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as the oxidant that, on the cathode, react to form water. If the surface temperature is sufficiently high (&gt;900 K) during catalytic water formation, a small fraction of OH molecules can desorb into the gas phase and be probed using laser spectroscopy. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is a sensitive technique for diagnostics, imaging, and measuring relative concentrations. This method can also be used to determine rotational temperature distributions of species in combustion systems by probing several resonances. Determination of quantitative concentrations is important for successful comparisons with simulations. Absolute number densities give valuable information when determining rate constants and are preferred for a detailed understanding of the complex chemistry on the catalytic surface. To complement the extensive LIF studies and to encourage further modelling of the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/O<small><sub>2</sub></small> system, the abundance of OH outside of a polycrystalline platinum catalyst was quantified using CRDS. This method is a highly sensitive absorption method well suited for measuring reaction intermediates in trace amounts. The only pre-requisites for CRDS to work are that the species of interest absorb light at an accessible wavelength and that there is no interference from other species at this wavelength. This technique, in contrast to LIF, can also be applied even if the excited state of the probed molecule does not fluoresce. Because of its long absorption path length, CRDS is also much more sensitive than conventional absorption methods such as FTIR. This paper described the principles of the technique in some detail and is a good introduction to the theory of CRDS. The authors presented results quantifying hydroxyl radicals from a platinum catalyst using CRDS and compared them with results from a LIF experiment under the same conditions. Differences were observed and possible reasons for the differences were presented.

The conventional process is alkaline electrolysis, which has been in commercial use for more then 80 years. Since hydrogen generated by electrolysis uses electrical power it is a challenge to make this process economically more acceptable. Nickel and nickel-based electrodes are mainly employed in industrial water electrolysis because of their good electrocatalytic ability for hydrogen evolution, corrosion resistance to the strongly alkaline environment and low price. Nevertheless, significant deactivation of commercial cathodes in long-term exploitation has been observed. Since overall energy efficiency of electrolysis is depended on hydrogen evolution kinetics, optimization of cathode polarization performances has become one of the most important subjects in electrochemistry.

Results showed the Tafel slope, the exchange current density, the overpotential needed for a fixed hydrogen production rate and the apparent energy of activation. Kinetic parameters revealed advanced catalytic ability of the MoPt<small><sub>2</sub></small> over the TiPt cathode towards hydrogen evolution reaction. Also, a significant improvement was achieved by using an ionic activator. The presence of Mo and Co species attached to the cathode surface was confirmed by XRF analysis.

Additionally, hydrogen is a clean and sustainable energy source, which can be used as fuel for transportation and power generation with fuel cells. Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced by the catalytic steam reforming of natural gas, oil-derived naphtha, partial oxidation of heavy oils and coal gasification. However, the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels will increase the emission of carbon dioxide. Because of this, the use of biomass as a feedstock for hydrogen production or as an energy source is attracting considerable attention.

The catalyst giving the highest hydrogen yield and carbon conversion was reported. Catalyst deactivation was predominantly caused by cooling and ways of regeneration were discussed. The catalyst characteristics and the intermediate species formed in the steam reforming processes were investigated by a range of techniques, which are fully discussed in the paper. These included XRD, XPS, ICP-OES and FT-IR measurements. Of note, XPS was employed to investigate the atomic states, their compositions on the catalyst surfaces and carbon depositing during the steam reforming of the bio-oil. XPS measurements were made using Mg Ka primary radiation (15 keV, 10 mA). The normalized XPS intensities, which are proportional to the effective concentrations of the corresponding elements on the surface layer, were determined as the integrated peak areas divided by their corresponding sensitivity factors.

Its desired products, allyl alcohols, are of significant importance for the fragrance, food and pharmaceutical industry. Reduction of an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> crotonaldehyde, leads to three main products. Hydrogenation of the C=C bond leads to formation of the saturated aldehyde (butyraldehyde), while reducing the carbonyl group yields the desired unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol). As a result of full hydrogenation of the molecule, the saturated alcohol (butanol) is formed. This reaction is most often carried out with group VIII metal catalysts, especially platinum. However, hydrogenation of the C=O bond is not favoured thermodynamically and catalysts require modifications in order to improve the selectivity towards formation of the unsaturated alcohol. Ruppert and Paryjczak<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241</span></sup></a> have investigated Pt/ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalysts with different zirconia loadings for the gas phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. These catalysts were subjected to low- and high-temperature calcination (200 and 400 °C) and a range of reduction temperatures (200–600°C). Pt/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was used as a reference system. The catalysts were characterized by TPR, XPS, SEM, HR TEM, ToF-SIMS and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO chemisorption after different stages of thermal pre-treatments. The relationships between catalytic activity, selectivity towards crotyl alcohol and physicochemical properties of the catalysts were examined and the authors attempted to understand the relationship between the aforementioned physicochemical properties of the catalysts and their behaviour in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. The comparison of catalysts calcined at different temperatures was of special interest, as this subject has not been thoroughly pursued in the literature to date. This paper discussed the analytical techniques in some detail. The platinum-titania catalysts, modified with the addition of zirconia into the support, were found to retain the good selectivity towards the C=O bond hydrogenation, associated with the formation of Pt–TiO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> interfacial active sites. Loss of catalytic activity was avoided due to the second oxide, which controlled the titania migration. The most favourable properties in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation were achieved for the catalyst containing 30% ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the support, calcined at 200 °C and reduced at 500 °C. While the effects of high-temperature reduction on the properties of catalysts on reducible supports have been widely described, much less was known about the influence of calcination temperature. In this case, higher selectivity was obtained on the Pt/ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalyst calcined at lower temperature. This was explained by the formation of an oxidised platinum phase with smaller particle sizes, which allows for more TiO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> migration onto the metal surface during high-temperature reduction, which follows calcination. Therefore, by careful choice of the support composition and pretreatment temperatures, the surface coating of platinum with titania was kept at the optimum level to provide high selectivity towards crotyl alcohol without the loss of catalytic activity.</span></div><div><span id="sect2618"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.5 Hydrogen sulfide oxidation. </span><span>Recently the catalytic effects of composite materials have been investigated because of the possibility of multi-functional applications. Mixing materials or creating their nanoscale assemblies very often leads to a synergetic effect in such processes as catalysis, gas storage or drug delivery mechanisms. The processes involved in formation of nano-composites are often time consuming and material demanding which ultimately increase their cost. An interesting route to developing composite materials is based on utilization of wastes, such a polystyrene, clays exposed to heavy metal adsorption or waste clays applied for removal of organic compounds in food production processes (from vegetable oil). In addition, fly ash or ash produced during the burning of fossil fuel, mainly coal, has found interesting applications in composite materials. Seredych and Bandosz<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit415"><sup><span class="sup_ref">415</span></sup></a> have focused on development of sewage sludge-based adsorbents for desulfurization from gas phase effluents. It was shown that materials, which are the mixtures of inorganic oxides such as calcium, magnesium, iron, copper and carbon phase are excellent adsorbents for H<small><sub>2</sub></small>S removal from moist air. This happens because of a high dispersion of calcium species, which provide the basic pH necessary for dissociation of hydrogen sulfide followed by oxidation of HS<small><sup>−</sup></small> ions by active oxygen. Iron, on the other hand, activates oxygen and takes part in the electron transfer process (Fe<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/Fe<small><sup>2+</sup></small>). The presence of a carbonaceous phase, even non-microporous, contributes to the dispersion of a sludge-based catalytic phase and provides space for storage of the oxidation product, elemental sulfur. The authors reported that mixing sewage sludge with spent mineral oil resulted in 20% higher capacity for H<small><sub>2</sub></small>S removal than that obtained on the material derived from unmodified sludge. The differences in the performances were attributed to the subtle changes in an organic phase, since the general composition of the inorganic phase seemed not to be affected. The objective of this work was to demonstrate a unique nanostructure and chemistry of sewage sludge derived adsorbents and its effect on the catalytic performance. As examples the materials carbonized between 650°C and 950°C were chosen as media on the surfaces of which reactive adsorption of hydrogen sulfide occurs. The development of a catalytic surface was presented not only as a function of pyrolysis temperature but also of pyrolysis time. Both these factors were found to be crucial for thermal activation of sewage sludge derived materials. The analytical techniques employed in studying these materials (thermal analysis, XRD, XRF, SEM-EDX and TEM) were described in the paper. The authors concluded that complex waste products such as sludges may be used as precursors for composite catalytic materials with sophisticated nano-features. After thermal treatment their surface was found to be a mixture of carbon nanostructures, with an active inorganic phase, highly dispersed within the surface layer of amorphous carbon.</span></div><div><span id="sect2628"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.6 NO<small><sub>X</sub></small> reductions and Perovskite catalysts. </span><span>The selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides by hydrocarbons offers an attractive alternative to NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>-selective catalytic reduction technology.

To perform studies on this system it was necessary to have a support that allowed complete iron reduction in order to be used as a reference; the authors used a carbon support because of its low metal-support interaction.

In this way, metal catalysts supported on niobia showed a higher selectivity towards long chain saturated hydrocarbons compared with the alumina supported ones. In a Co/Nb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> system, these results were explained by the formation of new catalytic sites involving the metal and the partially reduced support during high temperature reduction through the strong metal support interaction effect (SMSI).

Many such reactions are performed using acid anhydrides or acyl chlorides in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of amine. Protic and Lewis acids are well documented catalysts for such acylation reactions. However, using acetic anhydride as acetylating agent and soluble bases or acids as reagents or catalysts causes significant difficulties in the recovery of the catalyst and by-products, leading to &lt;50% atom economy in the consumption of acetic anhydride. Consequently, new methods to overcome these problems are of current interest. One such method involves the use of insoluble solid acids. However, in this case the reaction rate is small, and the acetylating agent is still acetic anhydride. Another solution involves metal triflates; however, in this case, although acetic acid is used as acylating agent and the atom economy is high, the catalyst is soluble and difficult to recover from the products. Because of these disadvantages, simplification of the acylation reaction through the design of new strong heterogeneous acid catalysts that can replace the conventional hazardous liquid- or traditional waste-generating Lewis-acid catalysts is very important. In this context, room temperature ionic liquids are attracting special interest as acid catalysts in organic syntheses. However, the use of biphasic systems requires relatively large amounts of ionic liquid, which may create some economic and toxicologic issues.

A practically constant P/Ti ratio was determined at different X-ray incident angles for the P-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/0.05 sample, which means that the P-abundant layer is thicker than the escape depth of the P 2p electrons from the sample. The analysis of this material is discussed in detail by the authors. Palladium based catalysts provide efficient and selective reduction of several drinking water contaminants, including nitrate, but their long term usage requires an effective regeneration protocol. Chaplin and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit423"><sup><span class="sup_ref">423</span></sup></a> have reported the regeneration of sulfur fouled bimetallic palladium based catalysts. A range of regeneration procedures were tried following catalyst deactivation with sulfide. These included the use of dissolved oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite and hot air. Hypochlorite and hot air were found to effectively restore nitrate reduction rates. ICP-MS showed that hypochlorite caused dissolution of Cu from the Pd–Cu catalyst but a Pd–In catalyst was stable. XPS showed that PdS and InS complexes formed during fouling and that regeneration with hypochlorite converts some S<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> to S<small><sub>6</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> with a corresponding increase in nitrate reduction rates. Izumi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit424"><sup><span class="sup_ref">424</span></sup></a> employed XANES for the study of photo-oxidation over mesoporous V-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalyst. This allowed a specific redox reaction mechanism to be proposed between V<small><sup>(IV)</sup></small> and V<small><sup>(III)</sup></small> states. Bulk Au has long been regarded as a highly inert metal with little or no chemical and catalytic activity. However, Tian and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit425"><sup><span class="sup_ref">425</span></sup></a> and references therein have found that Au can exhibit surprisingly high catalytic reactivity when it is highly dispersed on selective metal oxides (Au/oxides) and the authors claimed that Au/oxide catalysts have become one of the hottest systems in catalysis, being widely applied to many important processes, such as CO oxidation, selective oxidation of propene, nitrogen oxide reduction, and photo-catalytic oxidations used for environmental cleanup. It has been confirmed by various studies that the catalytic property of Au/oxide catalysts depends significantly on the size of Au particles, the interaction between Au and the supporting oxide, as well as the nanostructure of the active sites. The authors discussed in detail the preparation of Au/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalysts, their use in photo-oxidation, using methyl orange as a model compound, and their characterization by a range of techniques. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were explained in terms of Plasmon resonance of metallic gold particles and the intensity was related to the size of the gold particles. XPS was carried out to elucidate the oxidation of the gold nanoparticles. Other techniques employed included XRD, AAS and TEM. The photocatalytic properties of these catalysts were explained by the size, loading and distribution of gold particles, as elucidated by the above techniques. Xu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit426"><sup><span class="sup_ref">426</span></sup></a> have reported the preparation and characterization of various transition metal loaded BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small> catalysts and studied the photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue. They employed ICP-OES, XRD, XPS, UV-Vis DRS and photoluminescence to characterize these systems and the influence of a range of different transition metal loadings was discussed.</span></div><div><span id="sect2801"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.10 Coke formation. </span><span>Formation of coke is a common problem with many catalysts, and can result in catalyst deactivation. Rodrigues and Monteiro<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit427"><sup><span class="sup_ref">427</span></sup></a> addressed the analysis and characterization of coke species in their studies of the effect of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> addition on the non-oxidative dehydro-aromatization of methane over a molybdenum MCM-22 catalyst. The major objective of this work was to study the effect of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> addition to the above catalytic system under varying conditions of temperature and pressure. The authors also studied the formation of coke and characterized the various coke species using TGA, and thermo programmed oxidation. In addition to carbidic carbon, they observed two other types of coke. One was associated with the molybdenum and the other with the Brønsted acid sites located on both the catalyst surface and inside the zeolite pores. The species which were associated with the acid sites and known to be responsible for polyaromatics formation and catalyst deactivation were reduced significantly by the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and this increased the catalyst stability.</span><table cellspacing="5">4 Glossary of terms<tr><td>AAS</td><td>Atomic absorption
