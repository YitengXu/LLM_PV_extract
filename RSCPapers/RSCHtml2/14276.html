        <span class="bold">R. J. Dwayne Miller</span> opened a general discussion of the paper by Junko Yano: Assuming one can obtain the structure of the Mn/Ca water splitting site, is this sufficient information to understand the water splitting mechanism? I would think one would want to catch the actual water splitting event in the barrier crossing region. The Mn/Ca positions could be strongly modulated by the protein environment to drive this process. Synthetically, it would be relatively easy to do this but the dynamic coupling to the surrounding protein and the charged environment could be the difference in the low efficiency so far of synthetic photocatalysts. Put another way, what is the key question that will be answered by getting the structure of the water splitting complex in the fully primed S<small><sub>4</sub></small> state?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> responded: We don't know which two oxygens come together to form the O–O bond. I think getting the structural information of the S<small><sub>3</sub></small>, S<small><sub>3</sub></small>′ and S<small><sub>0</sub></small> states will help determine the site of the reaction. We indeed also aim to catch the S<small><sub>4</sub></small> state (the transient state where the O–O bond is formed), but it may be present at very low concentrations only, if the rate of its decay is faster than the rate of its formation. Nevertheless, together with various spectroscopic and mass spectrometric techniques, plus theoretical calculations, we should be able to understand the mechanism. There have been huge efforts to synthesize catalysts that are akin to the OEC, while structural mimics have become very similar to the Mn<small><sub>4</sub></small>CaO<small><sub>5</sub></small> cluster, making a close functional mimic has not been that successful so far.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Kiyoshi Ueda</span> asked: Could you please explain more about how the structure and oxidization stage change in the Mn–Ca cluster in PS II when one goes through S<small><sub>1</sub></small> → S<small><sub>2</sub></small> → S<small><sub>3</sub></small> → S<small><sub>4</sub></small> → S<small><sub>0</sub></small><span class="italic">via</span> photon absorption at each step? How much do you know about the structures for these states? Also, what is the time scale of the reaction of each step?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> answered: Regarding the structure, the resting S<small><sub>1</sub></small> structure is known from crystallography. For other stable S-states, there are many spectroscopic studies, where these S-states are generated with laser flash excitation and then captured using a cryo-trap method, with the data collection being at cryogenic temperature. There are no published high-resolution crystal structure data on the other S-states yet. This is why we and some other groups work on improving the XFEL approach, with the focus on getting such structures at room temperature. The transitions from one S state to the next occur in the 20–2000 microsecond timescales. Once formed, the S<small><sub>0</sub></small>–S<small><sub>3</sub></small> states are stable within the time scales of the XFEL experiment. In contrast, the S<small><sub>4</sub></small> state decays rapidly into S<small><sub>0</sub></small> with the release of O<small><sub>2</sub></small>. It is not certain yet if it will be possible to obtain a spectroscopic or crystallographic signature of it. It is presently assumed that the S<small><sub>0</sub></small> state has three Mn(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) ions and one Mn(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) ion, and that on each S state transition one Mn(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) is oxidized to Mn(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>). The S<small><sub>4</sub></small> state formation may be coupled to oxygen radical or Mn(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) formation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wolfgang Domcke</span> commented: In the natural photosystem II, the photons are absorbed by a pair of chlorophylls. In your experiment, are the photons absorbed by the manganese cluster or by chlorophyll? What happens between the photon absorption and the structural changes observed in the manganese cluster?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> answered: The light is absorbed primarily by the chlorophyll molecules in the antenna of photosystem II. This creates an electronically excited state. By excitation energy transfer, this excitation energy can be transferred into the reaction center, where it leads to the primary charge separation between P<small><sub>680</sub></small> and Pheophytin. P<small><sub>680</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> then oxidizes the side chain tyrosine D, which in turn oxidizes the Mn<small><sub>4</sub></small>CaO<small><sub>5</sub></small> cluster. After four such events, the Mn<small><sub>4</sub></small>CaO<small><sub>5</sub></small> cluster oxidizes two water molecules and thus returns to its lowest oxidation state (S<small><sub>0</sub></small>). The time between the photoabsorption and the oxidation of the Mn cluster varies in each S-state transition. For example, the half time of the S<small><sub>2</sub></small> state formation after the illumination of the S<small><sub>1</sub></small> state is about ~90 microseconds. We note that the Mn cluster can absorb IR and UV light, but that the absorption coefficients for these are rather low. Such direct light absorption may contribute in part to photodamage of the OEC. In contrast, it does not induce S state transitions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Hans Jakob Wörner</span> remarked: What are typical numbers for the collection efficiency and the energy resolution in your X-ray emission measurements? Would it be feasible and/or beneficial to perform X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the samples that you have studied?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> replied: For example, the data collection of the Kβ<small><sub>1,3</sub></small> XES of 1 mM Mn in solution with a 150 micrometer sample path length will take approximately 10 min at the LCLS with ~1 x 10<small><sup>12</sup></small> incident photons per pulse. The resolution depends on the element studied, since it depends on the type of crystals used and the geometry, for 3d transition metals it is between 0.5 and 1.5 eV. XPS has not been done so far on these samples. As far as I know, XPS has been attempted on biological samples only at metal L-edges, but with serious damage to the systems. Part of the reason is the concentration of metals in the sample, the penetration depth of the X-rays and the path length of the photoelectrons. Even if high-energy X-rays are used for XPS, it will be still difficult to probe metals in aqueous solution with concentrations of ~1 mM.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael Minitti</span> asked: In your von Hamos spectrometer, I believe you use a 16 crystal element. What would be the effect on your spectra if you used a spectrometer with more elements? Would the resolution get better? What are the trade offs?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> replied: The efficiency of the spectrometer scales with the number of crystals since we are covering a more or less solid angle. The energy resolution is similar as it is mainly determined by the type of crystals used and the geometry. In fact, the resolution would start degrading significantly due to geometric effects if we were to use more crystals in the vertical direction (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> more than 4 rows of crystals).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael Minitti</span> remarked: There is a definite race to achieve a certain resolution in the X-ray diffraction images. What is the goal? And as a follow up, what is the resolution limit in the current state-of-the-art?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> replied: Ideally, we would like to achieve better than 2 Å resolution in order to define oxygen positions. Currently, 1.9 Å is achieved in the dark resting state structure at cryogenic temperature. At room temperature, the published data is around 4.5 Å for photosystem II but it is getting better than 2.5 Å.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shaul Mukamel</span> commented: An exciting goal of X-ray spectroscopy will be to resolve the different manganeses and their evolving oxidation states. Can you do that at this point? This could clarify the mechanism of the water splitting complex in PS II. Stimulated resonant X-ray Raman spectroscopy is a promising candidate.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> responded: It is not possible to do stimulated resonant X-ray Raman spectroscopy right now for dilute samples like PS II, but there are some experiments that could pave the road to do such types of experiments at XFELs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Chris Milne</span> asked: Have you thought about doing the experiment in solution? X-ray absorption would potentially give you more information – would you be interested in exploring this at SACLA where you can easily do long-range X-ray energy scans?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> responded: We are doing XES data collection on solution samples as well, and it is far more efficient than collecting XES from crystals due to the high hit rate. Collecting X-ray absorption spectra is certainly a good idea, to get more detailed electronic structural information of the metal cluster, and we are also working in this direction.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">R. J. Dwayne Miller</span> remarked: Don't you need to observe the point of barrier crossing (dynamics) and not just the ‘static’ structure of this water splitting step? Admittedly, this structural information will help enormously into thinking about the rearrangements involved to prime the water splitting step.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> answered: Yes, that is what we are aiming for, in order to understand the structural changes. Getting the ‘static' structures of the S<small><sub>3</sub></small>, S<small><sub>3</sub></small>′ and S<small><sub>0</sub></small> states are however excellent starting points.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Chris Milne</span> commented: To look at the valence to core XES, would it make sense to use a Johann-geometry spectrometer for better efficiency over a narrow energy range? Would the experiment be possible using this approach (are there enough photons)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> answered: The Rowland approach would be indeed more efficient over that particular narrow energy range (all of the crystal solid angle is used for one energy), but then you would be collecting only one point of your spectrum and you would need to scan the spectrometer and detector. This could be problematic for pump–probe experiments at the LCLS due to the intrinsic shot-by-shot fluctuations and the need for good normalization. The flux would be enough and this might be the way to go to avoid the large background effects associated with the von Hamos approach, and we are considering that option.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tom Penfold</span> said: How close are you to achieving a valence-to-core XES measurement on these low concentration proteins? Besides the low cross section, what are the obstacles in the way of this?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> responded: The obstacle is the background that comes from the von Hamos spectrometer. While the data collection of the valence-to-core emissions of dilute samples will be possible in the current setup of XFELs, the data collection time is too long and our estimation will be about 4 to 5 h. At synchrotron facilities, we have collected the valence-to-core XES of PS II from frozen solution samples using Rowland circle geometry, and that is possible. However, we need to change samples quite often in order to work within the threshold of a certain X-ray dose to avoid radiation-induced changes. Collecting one spectrum with a reasonable S/N will take about half a day.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">R. J. Dwayne Miller</span> commented: In trying to populate 100% of the S<small><sub>4</sub></small> state, you need a 4-photon absorption process. Since you are not dealing with a strictly 3-level system with a bottleneck state to accumulate population, it is not possible to get 100% population of a given excited state. To be specific, the transition to a third level must be off-resonant from that of the second bottleneck state. The fact that you use 532 nm excitation and have rapid vibrational relaxation to the exciton manifold helps act as the donor state but the excited states are still resonant for excited state absorption processes. The excited state cross section is not so different from the ground state or is at least non-negligible. Each photon cycle needed to push the population to as high an excited fraction of S<small><sub>1</sub></small> to S<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small> as possible requires multiple photon absorption per PS II site. Much of this energy goes in as heat. There should be a significant temperature rise as the crystals have very low thermal conductivity and are on the 10 micron scale. I expect thermal diffusion times on the order of 1 ms. Has anyone measured the temperature rise in the crystals and how does it compare to barriers and rates for potential conformational changes? If not, can you walk us through the estimate of the Δ<span class="italic">T</span> for the excitation conditions used.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> replied: There seems to be a misunderstanding because of the confusing nature of the nomenclature for the intermediate states of the water-oxidizing Mn<small><sub>4</sub></small>CaO<small><sub>5</sub></small> catalyst (S<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>, <span class="italic">n</span> = 0 to 4, states). These S<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small> states do not refer to a multi-photon excitation in the PS II reaction center, which is not necessary to populate higher S-states. In PS II, the system is comprised of an ultrafast light capture and charge separation process taking place in the reaction center that is coupled to a slow ‘charge capacitor’, the water oxidizing catalytic complex. The reaction center resets itself after electron extraction from the cluster and the oxidation equivalents are stored in the Mn<small><sub>4</sub></small>CaO<small><sub>5</sub></small> cluster after each light-induced charge separation leading to the formation of the stable S-states (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> starting from the dark stable S<small><sub>1</sub></small> state, one charge separation leads to the formation of the next highest oxidized state, the S<small><sub>2</sub></small> state). In this respect the nomenclature of the S-states, as explained above, of the water oxidizing complex in PS II should not be confused with the S state nomenclature used in photochemistry to denote different photoexcited states of a pigment. One might expect to see a small change in the electron transfer rate due to electrostatic effects of the cluster, but the oxidation of the cluster is accompanied by proton transfer reactions, compensating the charge accumulation, and therefore no highly charged species are formed. The S-states of the water oxidizing complex are very long lived (on the time scale of seconds) and can be transformed to the next state in the photochemical cycle by a subsequent photon absorption and charge separation. Our illumination conditions are chosen to drive one charge separation event per flash and per center to obtain the maximum yield of holes on the cluster in each turnover pulse and the overall S-state populations achieved under these conditions are shown in Fig. 3 in our paper. Using, on average, a power of 100–130 μJ pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, a laser spot size of 500 micron in diameter and taking into account the size and volume of the irradiated sample (~250 micron in diameter) we deposited 8–10 J ml<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of the crystal suspension. Assuming the worst case of 100% conversion of all these photons into heat, this would lead to a temperature change of ~2 K. When we instead look at a single crystal of 10 micron thickness and take into account the irradiation at the surface of the sample volume and the absorption coefficient of PS II of ~2 mM<small><sup>−1</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 530 nm, a full conversion of all absorbed photons in the crystal into heat would lead to a temperature change of 3.8 K. This number does not take into account that in reality the largest fraction of the excess absorbed light is converted to fluorescence and not to heat. The sample is fully thermally equilibrated in the timescale of our delay time (0.5 s) between subsequent pulses so we do not expect any additional heating due to us applying multiple light excitation pulses to the same sample volume.</p>

        <span class="bold">R. J. Dwayne Miller</span> said: In the pulse cycling of PS II used for the preparation of the S<small><sub>3</sub></small> and S<small><sub>4</sub></small> states, it is not possible to excite 100% of each step in the overall photocycle for water splitting. These are not examples of 3-level systems with well separated resonances where fast relaxation can lead to a population bottleneck to give inversion and, in principle, 100% excitation. As the excited population increases with increasing excitation intensities, there will be an equal probability for either stimulated emission back to the ground state or stimulated absorption to upper excited states. The use of 532 nm helps but the excited state absorption, as determined from 2D spectroscopy and fs studies, has nearly the same absorption cross section as the ground state absorption. Even for multiple-excited chlorophyll in the light harvesting units, there will be a significant fraction of excited molecules experiencing excited state absorption. The other problem, as you state in the paper, is that if the time interval is too short, the photocycle does not have time to fully develop. The same issue would occur within your pulse duration. I understand that indirect methods have been used to estimate the degree of S<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small> state preparation. However, I don’t see how you can prepare 100% of any of the S<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small> levels and, as such, each distribution of S<small><sub>1</sub></small>–S<small><sub>4</sub></small> will contribute to a distribution with fractional populations among all the S<small><sub>1</sub></small>–S<small><sub>4</sub></small> states. This point is known from 2D photon echo studies of related systems in which it is possible to directly measure distributions and remove inhomogenous broadening effects from the population dynamics. How accurate is the use of XES/XAS and ESR for population distributions to state that one has 100% conversion to S<small><sub>4</sub></small>? This question is prefaced by the above comment. It seems to me you would need a baseline by which one could prepare 100% to know the absolute maximum signal possible for normalization with these methods. As I argue above, it is not possible. There will always be a distribution. Here I think 2D spectroscopic methods employing the same excitation pulse sequence would be essential to get the fraction S<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small> needed for the diffraction analysis. This comment is to point out that other methods that might prove useful to solve this problem.</p>

        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> responded: There is no way for making 100% of each S-state (except for the dark-stable S<small><sub>1</sub></small> state) due to the miss-hit and double hit connected to each light-induced S state transition. However, it is not necessary to make 100% pure S-states, as long as we have a way to estimate the population distribution of each S-state after a given number of flashes. The best case scenario of the S-state distribution is shown in Fig. 3 in our manuscript. These numbers are backed up by extensive oxygen evolution measurements under various experimental conditions (laser frequency, sample conditions, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) that were obtained under conditions highly similar to those during the XFEL experiments. We also record XES data at the beamline that confirm the turnover of the OEC, but they are not accurate enough yet to determine the exact S state populations.

        <span class="bold">Oliver Gessner</span> replied: Picosecond time-resolved XANES experiments on thin films of Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O by the Gaffney group indicate that both the O 1s and the Cu 2p<small><sub>3/2</sub></small> edges exhibit a red-shift as a result of photoexcitation with 400 nm pulses at peak fluences of ~5-10 mJ cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>.<small><sup>1</sup></small> This result would be inconsistent with a charge transfer between the oxygen and copper atoms, provided the X-ray spectroscopic responses are dominated by electronic dynamics. Furthermore, the fact that both the top of the valence band (VB) and the bottom of the conduction band (CB) are largely comprised of states with strongly hybridized O 2p/Cu 3d character (see, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Hu <span class="italic">et al.</span>)<small><sup>2</sup></small> does not favor a strong charge transfer character of the super-band gap excitations detected in picosecond time-resolved experiments. However, the relative weight of oxygen- and copper-centered orbitals may differ for VB and CB states, which may enable some charge transfer contributions. Femtosecond time-resolved experiments that access states before carrier relaxation to the band edges may also provide a different picture compared to measurements on picosecond timescales.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Oliver Gessner</span> responded: The distribution of sampling points is the result of the bunch fill pattern of the ALS in combination with the desire to map out the early, picosecond range dynamics with the more intense camshaft pulse. The camshaft bunch of the ALS resides in a ~60 ns wide gap within the bunch fill pattern, as can be seen in Fig. 2a.

        <span class="bold">Daniel Neumark</span> asked: Does the shift in your X-ray spectrum represent excitation into the conduction band or the valence band of Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O? Is it possible that the UV pump pulse moves enough of the population from the valence to conduction band to result in significant band gap narrowing, lowering the minimum energy of the conduction band and thereby causing the shift that you observe?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Oliver Gessner</span> replied: The extent of the observed inner shell absorption energy shifts, on the order of 1–2 eV, does not seem to be consistent with band narrowing being the sole source of these shifts. Band gap narrowing or renormalization due to significant excited carrier generation usually results from symmetric energy shifts of both valence and conduction bands in opposite directions. The transition energies from core levels to conduction band states would therefore be expected to shift by approximately half the amount of the total gap narrowing (when neglecting additional core level shifts). Within this picture, observed XANES shifts of 1–2 eV would correspond to a gap narrowing on the order of 2–4 eV, a range of values that mostly exceed the band gap of Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O of 2.3 eV. Note that this does not preclude some contribution of band renormalization effects to the observed shifts. While it is beyond the scope of this work to derive quantitative estimates for band narrowing in Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, it is instructive to compare the shifts reported here to high-level estimates for gap renormalization energies in other semiconductors. Using a GW approach, Pemmaraju recently estimated that the gap narrowing in silicon for electron doping intensities of 2.3 x 10<small><sup>21</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> amounts to ~180 meV.<small><sup>1</sup></small> For the experiments on Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O we estimate that the upper limit for excited carrier densities is ~7 x 10<small><sup>21</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> at a pump laser fluence of 6 mJ cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Thus, a notable contribution of band gap renormalization to the observed XANES shifts cannot be excluded, it is however not expected to be the dominant effect.</p>

        <span class="bold">Oliver Gessner</span> replied: Heating, phase transitions, and electronic dynamics may indeed contribute simultaneously and in a non-trivial fashion to time-resolved XANES spectra. Time-resolved EXAFS would be suitable to gain further insight into the nature of the dynamics underlying the near edge spectra.

The fact that each X-ray pulse only contains 1000 photons per pulse is interesting as this level of X-rays/pulse could be generated with a table top electron-Cu target source.

        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> answered: In our XFEL experiment, we always try to stay below the ionization or Auger cascade becoming noticeable in the data. Thus, we have not seen such effects in our experimental data. This is based on our observation of whether we see an XES spectrum that is comparable to that of the low dose synchrotron data collected at cryogenic temperature (to avoid radiation damage, but in this case we are avoiding the secondary radiation damage caused by the diffusion of hydroxl radicals induced by the interaction of X-rays and water molecules in the sample). We also argue the fact that we observe the expected spectral shift of the Kβ<small><sub>1,3</sub></small> spectrum between each S-state in the XFEL data that tells us the electronic damage is not visible in the data. Even if there is such damage, under our experimental conditions it is small (we calculated that in a single XFEL pulse, one Mn will only see 0.1 photons), and this will not prevent us from extracting the structural and spectroscopic information that we would like to get from the XFEL data.</p>

Do you think such kind of ultrafast charge migration might also play a role in your systems? In your case (or photochemical reactions in general) does charge move only with nuclei? How do you think charge transfer takes place in large systems?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> replied: Charge transfer between the co-factors in photosystem II is well-described by Marcus theory and the Moser-Dutton approximation. The rate of intermolecular electron transfer is determined by the distance of the co-factors, the medium in between, and the reorganization energies. So this is different to the above described case of electron movement to an excited state within a molecule.</p>

        <span class="bold">Oliver Gessner</span> answered: Unfortunately, our current experiments cannot resolve dynamics proceeding on femtosecond timescales. These are of course of great interest and several groups are pursuing either high-harmonics or free-electron laser-based routes to probe electronic and nuclear dynamics in condensed phase materials with few femtosecond or even sub-femtosecond temporal resolution. Generally, I would expect that nuclear motion may play an important role for charge migration in these complex systems in order to enable an effective net transfer of charge as opposed to pure oscillations. Indeed, some theoretical models predict that vibronic coupling plays an essential role during charge injection, for example, from a molecular dye into a semiconductor substrate<small><sup>1</sup></small> and a recent experimental study of photoinduced charge transfer in an organic photovoltaic blend has identified vibronic coupling as an enabling factor.<small><sup>2</sup></small></p>

But this doesn't address whether this is possible in PS II. Note that my original intended comment was on Kiyoshi Ueda's initial comment about X-ray damage in these kinds of measurements (SFX on PS II). We have measured both nanocrystals and molecules in solution at XPP (LCLS) and looked at the Kα and Kβ XES signals and we see significant distortions in the XES signals at almost all fluences. The focus used was on the order of 3 microns at the smallest and the mode was pink beam (non-monochromatic, ~3 mJ). So there is significant electronic damage around the transition metals in our samples at fluences comparable to the SFX experiments performed at CXI.</p>

        <span class="bold">Junko Yano</span> responded: No. We do not see a heating effect from the visible (532 nm) laser flashes that we employ for S state advancement. We estimated that the maximum temperature rise by the visible laser (if the entire energy results in heat, which is not the case in reality) will be only a couple of degrees. If a substantial heating effect existed, it would make the diffraction quality worse as we increase the number of flashes (we go up to 3 flashes when we make S<small><sub>0</sub></small>-rich sample). We do not see any differences in the crystal quality between the dark state and the 3F state. In contrast, the XFEL pulse will heat up the sample significantly, but the data collection is outrunning the sample damage.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Oliver Gessner</span> replied: Generally, the X-ray emission-based technique gives us greater freedom in the design of the samples compared to transmission-based absorption measurements and, therefore, also the mediation of thermal effects. In this particular case, however, the sample was a pellet consisting of compressed Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O powder, which we don’t expect to have good thermal conductivity.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> answered: Transient infra-red absorption spectroscopy with broadband, ultrafast laser pulses is indeed rich in detail because of the chemical information contained within vibrational spectra. Nevertheless, alternative spectroscopic techniques such as time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) will provide valuable and complementary information on non-adiabatic photochemical dynamics. In the gas phase, time-resolved PES has been shown to be a powerful method to observe changes in electronic state (<span class="italic">via</span> internal conversion and intersystem crossing) on ultrafast timescales,<small><sup>1</sup></small> and is perhaps better at capturing the dynamics at very short times after initiation. For example, in our time-resolved vibrational absorption spectroscopy (TVAS) measurements, our instrument response function is limited to 200–300 fs. Implementing PES in solution presents experimental challenges because of the need for high-vacuum to measure the kinetic energies of the emitted electrons. However, advances with liquid jet technologies have made these types of measurement possible.<small><sup>2</sup></small> Observation of ground electronic state dynamics remains a further challenge for PES because vacuum ultraviolet photons are required to ionize most ground-state molecules. Again, the complementary nature of different ultrafast techniques becomes evident because TVAS can report on the recovery of ground state molecules, or the formation of new photoproducts in their ground states, as illustrated in our paper and recent publications.<small><sup>3,4</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">Wolfgang Domcke</span> commented: Could you explain which specific new information you obtain by the investigation of these nucleosides in a condensed phase environment compared to the wealth of information that is available from experiments in the gas phase or in molecular beams.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> replied: The dynamical pathways followed by photoexcited molecules depend sensitively on the topography and character of electronically excited states, their energetic orderings, and their crossings with other excited states and the ground state. The locations and shapes of conical intersections are key to controlling non-adiabatic photochemical dynamics, and the pyrimidine bases present a particularly challenging class of compounds for experiment and theory to examine.<small><sup>1</sup></small> All these excited-state properties are sensitive to the environment in which the molecule is found, and hence are modified by the presence of a solvent. To some extent, solvent effects can be explored in molecular clusters under molecular beam conditions, but a bulk solvent at ambient temperatures is a rapidly fluctuating environment, and couplings between the solute molecules and solvent bath dissipate energy on timescales comparable to those for the photodynamics. Hence, there is much to be learned by studying the photodynamics in liquid solutions and contrasting with the gas phase studies. Moreover, studies in a range of solvent environments allow us to explore the effects of protic <span class="italic">vs.</span> non-protic and polar <span class="italic">vs.</span> non-polar intermolecular interactions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The gas phase studies of nucleobases (and other molecules), together with high-level electronic structure calculations and dynamical simulations for isolated molecules, provide a very important starting point for the interpretation of our data from solution phase measurements. As the question notes, a wealth of detailed information is available from state-of-the-art experiments in molecular beams, whether performed with high time (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> ultrafast photoelectron spectroscopy) or energy (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> velocity map imaging, or H-atom photofragment translational spectroscopy) resolution, particularly when combined with complementary theoretical studies. We are now in the exciting position of being able to make in-depth comparisons between the gas and condensed phase studies, which provide new insights and quantitative information about the multitude of ways in which solvents modify photochemical dynamics. In the specific case of the nucleoside studies reported in our paper, we observe how the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* states are shifted in energy by interaction with a solvent, and thus the branchings between dynamics on the <small><sup>1</sup></small>ππ* and <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* states are modified, with consequences for the triplet-state population in the case of thymidine. The efficient quenching of excess vibrational energy by the solvent bath also allows us to determine timescales for the recovery of ground-state molecules <span class="italic">via</span> different routes, and to quantify the quantum yields for competing photochemical pathways.</p>

        <span class="bold">Oliver Schalk</span> said: In your paper, you described the dynamics of pyrimidine nucleosides in chloroform. The dynamics have been previously studied in methanol, water and the gas phase. What new information do you expect by using yet another environment and why is it worth doing such an investigation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> responded: The photo-induced dynamics of the pyrimidine nucleosides involve excited states of different electronic character, and internal conversion and intersystem crossing, mediated by conical intersections, on femtosecond to picosecond timescales. Comparisons between measurements made in different solvents show that the timescales for these processes are sensitive to the properties of the solvent such as its dielectric constant and hydrogen bonding (as shown in Table 4 of our paper, where we collect the available experimental data). We can only develop a quantitative understanding of the influence of the solvent if we make measurements of excited-state lifetimes, and quantum yields for competing pathways such as triplet-state population and ground-state recovery, in a range of different environments. These types of comparative studies will test and improve theoretical and computational descriptions of the excited-state solute interactions with the surrounding medium. Ultimately, we would like to understand how the environment at the core of double-stranded DNA affects the photochemistry of the pyrimidine and purine nucleobases. This environment is not aqueous, and is also not well-represented by isolated-molecule studies. Instead, the dielectric constant in the DNA core is similar to that in chloroform. However, the detail that we are able to extract from ultrafast spectroscopy studies of solutions of nucleosides is difficult to reproduce in DNA strands because the closely stacked nucleobases do not act like isolated chromophores. Therefore, we need to produce quantitative and accurate theoretical models of how the local environment modifies the energies and crossings of excited states to be able to understand what happens in UV-excited DNA. Our work seeks to provide data that will facilitate this objective by using simpler, but well-chosen, model systems.</p>

        <span class="bold">Oliver Schalk</span> asked: In your study, you addressed the differences between the dynamics of pyrimidine nucleosides in chloroform and the protic solvents water and methanol as well as the gas phase. If the dynamical changes between different solvents are important, why did you chose a target with dynamics as complicated as those in the nucleosides?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> responded: There is already a rich literature of computational and experimental studies of the photochemistry of heterocylic organic molecules representative of some of the structural features of the nucleobases. We are therefore now well placed to push the limits of our studies to more complicated molecules such as the nucleosides, with good reason to expect that we can extract quantitative dynamical insights because of the remarkable capabilities of modern theory and experiment. Indeed, I do not think we should be satisfied with restricting ourselves to ever-more-detailed studies of simpler molecules: the electronic structures, nuclear dynamics and solute–solvent interactions that determine the photochemical behaviour of the nucleobases are, after all, largely specific to these molecules. We must therefore be prepared to tackle these complex molecular systems directly if we are to advance our understanding of their photochemistry.</p>

        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> answered: Yes, the study of canonical Watson–Crick dimers is a major part of our research activity in nucleobase photochemistry. For example, we recently reported a detailed study of the electron-driven proton transfer (EDPT) between guanine and cytosine nucleobases in their Watson–Crick dimers, using ultrafast transient electronic and vibrational absorption spectroscopy.<small><sup>1</sup></small> These studies necessitated the use of a non-protic solvent to allow the hydrogen-bonded Watson–Crick dimers to form. We were able to resolve both an ultrafast EDPT step across the central hydrogen bond, and a slower EDPT process across a second hydrogen bond that produced a tautomeric form of the guanine–cytosine dimer. We have subsequently extended this work to studies of the photodynamics in guanine–guanine dimers, and in adenine–thymine dimers adopting the Watson–Crick structure.</p>

        <span class="bold">Daniel Neumark</span> remarked: One of the appealing features of your experiment is that you are able to monitor relaxation dynamics on the ground state surfaces of the nucleic acid constituents, in contrast to methods such as time-resolved photoemission where only the excited state dynamics are energetically accessible. However, are you able to see any transient infrared signals associated with excited states? The <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* state in particular is quite long-lived (Fig. 5 and 7). Do you see any signature of that state in your experiments?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> responded: There is no reason in principle why we should not see transient infra-red absorptions from molecules in the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* state, given their lifetimes. The IR probe is sensitive to vibrational motions of the molecule, regardless of the electronic state, and sufficient population should accumulate transiently in the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* states to be observable with our signal-to-noise levels. However, we were only able to report one such band (Fig. 4 of our paper), which we assigned to an N–H stretch of the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* state of the imino-oxo form of 2′-deoxy-cytidine. We did not see corresponding transient absorptions in the carbonyl stretching region in either the 2′-deoxy-thymidine or 2′-deoxy-cytidine measurements. The most likely reason is that the spectra are congested, and transient absorption bands from <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ*-state molecules cannot be resolved if they sit on top of the stronger ground state bleach features. The timescales for depopulation of the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* state and recovery of ground-state molecules are similar, which means the spectroscopic signatures cannot be distinguished kinetically. It is also possible that certain transient absorption features associated with the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ-state populations are shifted to vibrational frequencies that lie outside our probe wavenumber ranges, and we did not shift the probe window to look for such bands.</p>

        <span class="bold">Albert Stolow</span> commented: In the low energy electron attachment experiments by Sanche,<small><sup>1</sup></small> damage to DNA bases such as adenine seems to occur at the N9 position. Theoretical considerations by Simons <span class="italic">et al.</span> indicate that electron attachment to the nucleobase can lead to rupture of the C–O bond between the sugar and the phosphate.<small><sup>2</sup></small> The electron-withdrawing nature of the phosphate is thought to play a key role. Although the excess electron will have significant effects on the dynamics (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> a transient anion <span class="italic">versus</span> a photoexcited neutral), we have speculated that an electron attached to the π orbital of adenine couples rapidly and efficiently to the σ* orbital at the N9 position in a manner similar to that discussed in our time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of isolated adenine.<small><sup>3</sup></small> Do you have any evidence of electron withdrawing groups having such effects in your results?</p>

        <span class="bold">Gareth Roberts</span> answered: Albert Stolow’s comment is not without merit, although in some ways UV- and low-energy-electron (LEE)-induced damage in DNA are separate sides of the same coin, in so much that they can both give rise to damage, the dynamical mechanisms initiated by these two scenarios could be very different.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In our measurements there is no obvious evidence that UV-initiated cleavage of the N–C glycosidic bond occurs at 260 nm in the pyrimidine nucleosides, analogous to theoretically predicted outcomes of LEE attachment into a π* hole on the nucleoside.<small><sup>1</sup></small> It should be said that in the gas phase, N9–H bond cleavage was observed for the adenine nucleobase at shorter excitation wavelengths (&lt;233 nm)<small><sup>2,3</sup></small> and calculated for other nucleobases;<small><sup>4</sup></small> our studies to date do not find evidence for this same channel in aqueous adenine at &gt;220 nm.<small><sup>5</sup></small> Second, our experiments are conducted in chloroform solutions, so the formation of solvated LEEs does not occur, shutting off the possibility of any diffusion-limited reactions between LEEs and nucleosides.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Finally, for nucleotides (rather than nucleosides) much theory has suggested that LEE-attachment will predominantly cleave the C–O sugar–phosphate bond (and not the glycosidic bond), leading to the ejection of free phosphate anions.<small><sup>1</sup></small> This behaviour is a model for LEE-induced strand breaks in double helix DNA, the ultrafast dynamics of which are currently poorly understood from an experimental perspective. In water (or more specifically D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), one could envisage a TVAS experiment which uses UV light to generate aqueous LEEs (either from the water solvent or I<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (aq)) and subsequently monitor the build-up of vibrational bands for any free phosphate as a signature for LEE-induced C–O cleavage in the nucleotide. Such an experiment is not without its challenges though, which could include prohibitively low signal levels due to the bimolecular nature of the LEE + nucleotide reaction (<span class="italic">cf.</span> Ref. 6) and disentangling the LEE-induced nucleotide dynamics from the UV-induced nucleotide dynamics.</p>

        <span class="bold">Wolfgang Domcke</span> asked: Saigusa and coworkers<small><sup>1</sup></small> showed a few years ago in a molecular beam experiment that the excited-state lifetime of adenosine is shorter than that of adenine. We could explain this result by demonstrating the existence of an additional relaxation channel in adenosine. This process is an electron-driven proton transfer from the ribose to adenine along an existing hydrogen bond. This relaxation mechanism may also be present in the nucleosides considered here. It would therefore be interesting to perform a detailed comparison of the excited-state decay constants of the bases and the corresponding nucleosides in solution.</p>

        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> answered: Unfortunately, we are unable to make this type of direct comparison between the nucleobases (cytosine and thymine) and their nucleosides (2′-deoxy-cytidine and 2′-deoxy-thymidine) because the former are not sufficiently soluble in our solvent of choice (chloroform). Alternative studies in aqueous solution are challenging because of the strong IR-absorption of water. To engineer sufficient solubility for the nucleosides in chloroform, we prepared them with silyl-group substitutions of the H-atoms attached to the hydroxyl sites in the 2′-deoxyribose moiety (see Fig. 1 in our paper). This chemical modification will switch off the electron-driven proton transfer (EDPT) mechanism that you previously identified.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> replied: This is a complicated question, and one that has been extensively explored both computationally and experimentally by judicious substitution studies. It is now recognized, for example through the work of Robb and coworkers,<small><sup>1–3</sup></small> that the locations and the shapes of conical intersections between states have a profound effect on adiabatic <span class="italic">vs.</span> non-adiabatic branching, as do inertial effects. Our current study does not directly shed any further light on this question. However, there may be some inertial effects of the 2′-deoxyribose group (and indeed the bulky silyl groups attached to it) on the dynamics at conical intersections between the <small><sup>1</sup></small>ππ*, <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* and S<small><sub>0</sub></small> states because, as Fig. 5 and 7 show, molecular deformation is necessary to access these conical intersections. There may also be subtle effects of solvent friction on the dynamics, compared to isolated molecules in the gas phase.

        <span class="bold">Martin Centurion</span> opened a general discussion of the paper by Vasilios Stavros: In Fig. 2a of your manuscript you mentioned a 900 ps lifetime, and there is also an ultrafast femtosecond component, which you attribute to multiphoton absorption. This fast peak does not appear as prominently on the experiments with the other two molecules shown in parts b and c. Can you explain why?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vasilios Stavros</span> responded: Both ConA and EF showed significant fragmentation and depletion of signal (where the action of the sum of the pump and probe pulses results in a decrease in the parent ion signal). In order to avoid this, lower pump and probe powers were used when recording TR-IY transients. The lower pump and probe powers used meant that multiphoton effects around time zero were reduced significantly in these transients, which is why ConA and EF do not display this very large signal spike around time-zero.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Russell Minns</span> commented: Your study concentrates on the behavior of the parent ion and I wonder if you see any fragmentation in your spectrum and if this provides any extra information on the dynamics?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vasilios Stavros</span> answered: EF did indeed undergo photofragmentation, and several fragment ions were detectable, as we show in Fig. S5 of the ESI in our paper. However, given that we ran the TR-IY measurements in EF with a reduced pump and probe power, to reduce extensive fragmentation of the parent, we obtained quite modest signal intensities of these fragments. As a result of this, trying to carry out TR-IY measurements of these fragments resulted in very poor transients owing to the poor signal-to-noise levels. As such, no useful information could be drawn from the time-dependent behaviour of these fragment mass channels.</p>

        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> asked: Can you estimate the yield of triplet states in your ethyl ferulate study? What might the consequences be of a sunscreen component that has a significant propensity for triplet state formation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vasilios Stavros</span> answered: Unfortunately, our experiments do not allow the measurement of quantum yields for each relaxation pathway. Such measurements of quantum yield are more amenable to transient absorption spectroscopy, such as transient vibrational absorption spectroscopy, where the extent of the bleach recovery may be used to extract quantum yields. As regards to significant triplet state formation in sunscreens, this is likely not ideal, given that there will be a long lived, and potentially reactive state. This excited-state molecule may, in turn, facilitate potentially harmful chemistry with other components within the multicomponent sunscreen, or, providing there is enough skin penetration, with skin cells. For this reason, off-the-shelf sunscreens also contain photostabilisers that can quench potentially reactive states.</p>

        <span class="bold">Daniel Neumark</span> asked: When molecules such as phenol are excited in the ultraviolet, dissociation <span class="italic">via</span> H atom loss is an important channel. This channel appears to be largely suppressed in the more complex systems that you have studied here. Is this because the H atom in question is hydrogen-bonded to a nearby heteroatom, or is it because the energy initially deposited into the aromatic ring <span class="italic">via</span> ππ* excitation leaks out quickly into the side chains?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vasilios Stavros</span> replied: As you correctly point out, we believe that the dissociation <span class="italic">via</span> H atom loss is not a viable pathway in any of these molecules (MVP, ConA and EF) due to the intramolecular H bond between the OH and OMe groups, which results in too high (and wide) a barrier for H atom dissociation. This is analogous to previous observations in similar molecules, specifically the most recent work we carried out on the building blocks of lignin.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Here we demonstrated that adding an OCH<small><sub>3</sub></small> group <span class="italic">ortho</span> to the OH group promoted the intramolecular hydrogen bond, leading to a significant decrease in the H<small><sup>+</sup></small> signal measured in our total kinetic energy release spectra (TKER, for both guaiacol and syringol, <span class="italic">cf.</span> phenol). I note here that these observations led us to conclude that the intramolecular hydrogen bond weakens as the S<small><sub>1</sub></small> state deviates from planarity; in the present work, these more complex systems are planar in the S<small><sub>1</sub></small> state (see Fig. 7 in the manuscript). This is in agreement with our present findings of the low H<small><sup>+</sup></small> signal (from one-photon mediated O–H bond fission) in our measured TKER spectra.</p>

        <span class="bold">Daniel Neumark</span> remarked: You mentioned at the end of your talk that isomerization of EF might be one of the main relaxation pathways based on a growing spectroscopic signal at long times. Is that <span class="italic">trans</span>-to-<span class="italic">cis</span> isomerization in the side-chain, and does the rise time for this signal match any of the decay times reported in your paper?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vasilios Stavros</span> answered: Indeed, the suggested <span class="italic">trans</span>/<span class="italic">cis</span> isomerisation I briefly alluded to for EF in my short presentation would occur with respect to the C=C double bond of the side-chain. This pathway seems to be operative in the most recent solution phase measurements we have carried out for an EF/cyclohexane mixture. Whether we can link the 2.5 picosecond time-constant we propose for <span class="italic">trans</span>/<span class="italic">cis</span> isomerisation in the solution phase measurements to the 15 picosecond time-constant (τ<small><sub>1</sub></small>=15 ps) in the gas phase can, in our opinion, only be tentative. This is largely based around our calculations (see Fig. 8), although we once again acknowledge that we cannot completely rule out this mechanism in the gas-phase. I’d also like to point out that for the solution phase measurements, the decay in the excited state absorption of the <span class="italic">trans</span> isomer does indeed match the rise in the appearance of <span class="italic">cis</span> isomer, as you would anticipate.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> remarked: The attribution of the ~150 ps time constant to relaxation within the triplet manifold seems slow for internal conversion, and perhaps inconsistent with Kasha's rule. Is there a reason why the internal conversion might plausibly be so slow?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vasilios Stavros</span> replied: We recognise that this time constant is perhaps longer than what would be expected for internal conversion. However, we attribute this to the large energy separation between the first (lower in energy) and second triplet states. That being said, and in light of the most recent solution phase measurements we have carried out which imply that a <span class="italic">cis</span> photoproduct may be formed following photoexcitation around the S<small><sub>1</sub></small> origin in EF/cyclohexane, the first time constant may have a component of the <span class="italic">trans</span>/<span class="italic">cis</span> isomerisation pathway (although our calculations do point towards this pathway being inactive), whilst the second, 150 ps time constant, may be an overall reflection of the ISC/IC process, the latter of which is in line with one of the caveats we proposed in the manuscript.</p>

        <span class="bold">R. J. Dwayne Miller</span> opened a general discussion of the paper by Tom Penfold: The dynamics of going from the metal–ligand charge transfer band into the high spin quintet state for Fe(bp)<small><sub>3</sub></small> has been reported to be less than 150 fs and now updated to be less than 50 fs.<small><sup>1</sup></small> This time scale is extremely fast and it seems to involve very fast relaxation to the fully relaxed quintet state to explain the relatively narrow transient absorption in the UV region assigned to the quintet state. The absorption lineshape in which 2 eV of excess energy has been dissipated should be quite broad but it seems to be fully relaxed. I don’t know what we learn from these time scales. The transition probability for intersystem crossing should depend on the spin–orbit coupling weighted by the Franck–Condon overlap connecting the singlet–triplet–quintet manifolds. From a single number, say 50 fs, how can we connect this measurement to the microscopic processes? Also the dynamics seem extremely fast. The assignments are based on optical spectra and the actual spin transition could be unrelated to the putative transitions. To date there has been no direct measurement of the spin transition (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> XES or MOKE probes) under excitation conditions low enough to avoid multiphoton ionization (which would create unpaired spins). I realize that you have studied a different Fe system, however, can you explain these extremely fast timescales based on your theoretical studies? Is a &lt;50 fs timescale consistent with the spin–orbit coupling for such systems as found from your theoretical studies? Also, in the limit, the dynamics are pushed to &lt;20 fs, at what point can we call the initial state a singlet? It is a heavily mixed state. Can you comment on this point?</p>

        <span class="bold">Tom Penfold</span> answered: The single timescale, say 50 fs, tells us that kinetics leading to the population of the quintet state is extremely fast. But this does not directly give us any insight into the microscopic processes responsible for driving this transfer. The timescale is so rapid that I would argue that to unravel the microscopic processes, quantum dynamics simulations such as those presented here, are possible and would very informative.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The transition between the states labelled <small><sup>1</sup></small>MLCT and <small><sup>3</sup></small>MLCT from their spin–orbit coupling free character in the model presented in our paper and in Ref. 1 is ~100 fs. This arises from the sizeable spin–orbit coupling and the small energy gap between the states. As spin–orbit coupling in these complexes will derive mostly from the iron 3d orbitals, I would not expect much difference in the size of spin–orbit coupling between iron complexes. However, the density of excited states in the low lying MLCT will increase significantly from [Fe(CAB)<small><sub>2</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> to [Fe(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small>. Consequently, I find a &lt;50 fs time scale entirely consistent with our model.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In terms of describing the initial state as a singlet, my feeling is that even before the dynamics becomes less than 20 fs it is not rigorous to label the initial state a singlet. For both the present case, [Fe(CAB)<small><sub>2</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small>, and [Fe(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> there is a high density of <small><sup>1</sup></small>MLCT and <small><sup>3</sup></small>MLCT states, which are close in energy, have very good Franck–Condon overlap and sizeable spin–orbit coupling. In the case of [Fe(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small>, the triplet and quintet metal centred states also intersect at or near the Franck–Condon geometry.<small><sup>2</sup></small> The size of the spin–orbit coupling and the small energy gap between these states means that a full description has to go beyond perturbation theory, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> Fermi's golden rule.

        <span class="bold">R. J. Dwayne Miller</span> commented: The other question that is keeping me up nights is the connection of the high spin transition of Fe spin crossover materials and Fe(bp)<small><sub>3</sub></small> involving a specific bond displacement. Typically it involves an Fe–N bond elongation and various probes claim excitation of this mode is involved and critical to the spin transition. The Fe–N bond elongation is treated as a ‘smoking gun’ for the spin transition to high spin states. On what physics is this connection made (other than the high spin state is calculated to have an elongated Fe–N bond and the antibonding nature of this excited state). If the motion of the Fe–N mode couples to the electron density to modulate the orbital angular momentum then this would provide a fluctuating magnetic dipole moment on the molecular frame that would in turn provide the force to couple to the electron spin (much like a change in charge distribution gives rise to a fluctuating dipole moment that can couple to the electric field in absorption of a photon). Does this mode contribute to the spin–orbit coupling significantly? If not, there are a lot of modes that would act to dissipatively decouple the low and high spin states if the spin–orbit coupling was sufficient without this consideration.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tom Penfold</span> answered: The Fe-N bond elongation is totally symmetric and therefore should not have a significant impact on the magnitude of the spin–orbit coupling matrix elements. In our present work we have treated the spin–orbit coupling matrix elements as a constant coupling, using their values at the Franck–Condon geometry. While spin–orbit coupling enhanced by vibrational motion (spin–vibronic) can be important in many systems, I do not think it contributes significantly in this case.</p>

        <span class="bold">Oliver Schalk</span> commented: In smaller molecules (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> butadiene), several studies with a reduced number of vibrational modes have been performed and can now be compared to more advanced studies like “on-the-fly” studies which intrinsically include all vibrational modes. The reduced dimensionality models all seem to get part of the dynamics wrong and while some of the initial dynamics might be represented correctly, failures are observed on a 50–100 fs timescale, particularly due to the energy flux not being able to distribute over the molecule correctly. In that sense, what are the limitations implied by the reduced Hamiltonian in this study?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tom Penfold</span> replied: The limitations of any reduced coordinate space Hamiltonian is that one is restricting the nuclear motion/vibrational energy to a subset of modes, rather than letting it redistribute throughout the whole molecule as it should. In the case of small organic molecules, such as butadiene, this can be a significant problem as they can often be quite floppy in the excited state. Consequently, describing the dynamics within a small subset of normal modes could represent a significant approximation. This is obviously not the case for all systems and model Hamiltonians have been successfully used, most famously for pyrazine. The complex studied here, [Fe(bmip)<small><sub>2</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> does not exhibit very large structural rearrangements and therefore lends itself nicely to a reduced space representation. The accuracy of any reduced space representation clearly hinges upon an suitable description of the important vibrational degrees of freedom. In the case presented here, due to the molecular symmetry and the relatively small structural changes, this choice is relatively straightforward. However, this is not always be the case. In such cases, an “on-the-fly” approach which includes all the nuclear degrees of freedom is clearly advantageous. The problem for these simulations, is that the computational expense associated with converging such dynamics for larger systems (&gt;50 atoms) is very significant. I suspect that in such cases the best way to proceed is to use the initial “on-the-fly” simulations to inform the coordinate choice for model dynamics.</p>

The transition density is therefore quite localised upon the iron and therefore less sensitive to structural changes.

        <span class="bold">Wolfgang Domcke</span> addressed R. J. Dwayne Miller: The photon can only couple to the excited singlet states, even if the singlet and triplet states are strongly mixed by spin–orbit coupling. Without coupling to vibrations, we have an electronic few-level system and the photoinduced dynamics can only consist of periodic oscillations of the electronic population between the singlet, triplet and quintet states. Coupling to the vibrations is necessary for irreversible transitions from the singlet states to the triplet and quintet states to occur.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">R. J. Dwayne Miller</span> responded: I agree with your comment. I think the issue here is whether or not the dynamics intrinsically reflect the spin–orbit coupling and/or the Franck–Condon factor overlap that weights the transition probability. The problem is that the dynamics have been interpreted as solely propagated by one vibrational mode, the Fe–N mode typically for [Fe(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> or other Fe-based spin crossover materials. The assignment is based on shifts or inferred absorption bands in which the spin transition was reported to be &lt;150 fs and now it is less than 50 fs. Since the spin transition is not fully resolved as yet, at some point one needs to ask what is the mechanism for such fast spin transitions. If the Fe–N motion is involved in driving the electron spin state into the high spin manifold, which is along your statement, then the dynamics are too fast for this mode. Issues of the initial state preparation come into play much like the case of charge transfer bands <span class="italic">vs.</span> excited state electron transfer in interpreting photoinduced electron transfer dynamics. I should add that on a preliminary basis, we have now completed fs electron diffraction studies on two Fe-based systems and do not see the purported Fe–N bond elongation until the ps timescale.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In this respect, I rather like your comment in that it would mean that the very high density of vibrational modes, if the spin–orbit coupling is sufficient, would serve this relaxation role. The spin transition would then occur on the IVR timescale, consistent with the observed dynamics. It would involve many modes not just the Fe–N displacement. I would still like to see a direct measurement of the spin transition – THz/ESR or at least magneto–optical measurements to really pin down the dynamics of the spin transition. We need the spin–orbit coupling and information on the nuclear Franck–Condon overlap between spin manifolds. A single number does not give the operating physics.

Intrastrand base stacking interactions can open relaxation <span class="italic">via</span> long-lived excimer/exciplex states and photo-damage channels, such as (2+2) cycloaddition and (6-4) adduct production. Both have been studied in detailed over recent years.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Our research group has recently focused on the role of interstand dynamics through Watson–Crick (WC) base pairing, which opens the possibility of UV-induced hydrogen(H)/proton transfer across intermolecular H-bonds. The role of interstrand proton or H atom transfer in double helix DNA has been debated for over five decades.<small><sup>2</sup></small> In its most recent guise, the debate has predominately stemmed from theoretical studies which postulated that ultrafast interstrand electron-driven proton transfer (EDPT) contributes to the prevention of mutagenic photolesions in DNA excited by absorption of solar UV radiation.<small><sup>3</sup></small> Despite extensive prior study of DNA photodynamics,<small><sup>1</sup></small> the question of whether UV-induced EDPT is active in WC base pairs has until very recently remained contentious and contradictory experimental results have been published.<small><sup>4–7</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">In collaboration with the research groups of Professor Friedrich Temps (Kiel) and Professor M. Carmen Galan (Bristol), ultrafast transient electronic absorption spectroscopy (TEAS) and transient vibrational absorption spectroscopy (TVAS) have been utilised to track the decay dynamics of UV-excited Guanine-Cytosine (G∙C) WC base pairs in chloroform solution.<small><sup>7</sup></small> As summarized in the top of <a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch1">Scheme 1</a>, the results show direct evidence for the involvement of EDPT in the deactivation dynamics of the G∙C WC pair.

This first EDPT process forms an intermediate G[−H]∙C[+H] biradical species with a quantum yield of ≥ 0.6 ± 0.1, and is trapped in a local minimum on the CT state for 2.9 ps. Alternatively, the initially excited <small><sup>1</sup></small>π<small><sub>G</sub></small>π<small><sub>G</sub></small>* state can be depopulated via monomer-like deactivation pathways with a quantum yield ≤ 0.4 ± 0.1.

      <p class="otherpara">The EDPT dynamics observed for G∙C show clear evidence for a step-wise double H atom transfer pathway, which is kinetically resolvable with our chosen experimental probes. However, theoretical studies of double H atom transfer in WC base pairs have also considered the possibility of a concerted rather than sequential mechanism.<small><sup>8,9</sup></small> Although a step-wise process is clearly resolvable through our TEAS and TVAS for G∙C, it raises the question whether (with currently available technology) two sequential ultrafast (&lt;40 fs) EDPT processes could be distinguished from a truly concerted pathway? Our current studies of the H-bonded G∙G homodimer in chloroform solution serve as a test-bed to illustrate this issue. The EDPT mechanism after 260 nm excitation of G∙G is summarized at the bottom of <a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch1">Scheme 1</a>. Provisional theoretical calculations indicate that a concerted double H-atom transfer mechanism is unfeasible in G∙G, although a sequential G∙G → G[−H]∙G[+H] → G*∙G* path is open at 260 nm. In contrast to the G∙C pair, where the G[−H]∙C[+H] biradical could be transiently trapped in an excited state minimum, the G[−H]∙G[+H] structure instead lies at a point of conical intersection with S<small><sub>0</sub></small>, with no local minima en route. After photoexcitation of G∙G to a <small><sup>1</sup></small>ππ* state, we observe population decay out of the vertical Franck–Condon window within 70 fs through TEAS, with no observable spectral signature(s) for a G[−H]∙G[+H] species. However, TVAS in the N–H stretching region clearly tracks ultrafast formation of a G*∙G* double H-atom transferred photoproduct, with a lifetime &gt;1.4 ns and a quantum yield of ~0.35. Although theory indicates double H atom transfer should be sequential in G∙G, our current experiments are unable to resolve the ultrafast step-wise dynamics. Instead, it is experimentally observed as a quasi-concerted process, due to the nature of the excited state potential energy landscape along the sequential H atom transfer coordinate.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> responded: The lengthening of the lifetimes of the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* states is likely to be a consequence of their destabilization, and hence a raising of the energies of conical intersections with the electronic ground state to which they decay. This effect is evident in different solvents: the protic solvents can hydrogen bond with the non-bonding electrons in the carbonyl groups of the pyrimidine nucleosides, and excitation of one of these electrons to a π* state (giving the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* configuration) weakens this stabilizing interaction. Destabilization of the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* state may also arise when an alkyl or ribose group replaces the N<small><sub>1</sub></small> hydrogen atom in either cytosine or thymine, although the effects apparently differ as the question notes.

The second reason is that the chromophore excited in a DNA molecule may differ significantly in character from that in an isolated nucleobase (for which we assign a localized π* ← π transition). Within a DNA strand, the nucleobases are stacked closely, and electronic excitation is likely to be delocalized over multiple bases (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the UV absorption prepares an excitonic state, with character that will depend on the precise base sequence). The subsequent ultrafast photodynamics may therefore differ, and are an active field of investigation. Nevertheless, we believe that the exploration of the photodynamics in isolated, solvated nucleobases is interesting because it offers deep insights into available deactivation pathways, helps to explain the stability of the nucleobases to UV radiation exposure in the pre-biotic Earth, and provides excellent candidates for fundamental studies of non-adiabatic photochemical dynamics.</p>

        <span class="bold">Russell Minns</span> commented: For the hydrogen transfer measurements, are the measurements sensitive to the ground and excited electronic states? If they are sensitive to both, can you differentiate which parts of the dynamics occur on the excited and ground electronic states?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> responded: The TVAS measurements are, in general, sensitive to molecules in both the ground and electronically excited states. Indeed, this is one of the strengths of the technique because vibrational frequencies of functional groups such as the carbonyl and N–H stretches used in our study change with the electronic state of the molecule (because vibrational force constants are determined by the bonding character). The vibrational frequencies are also modified by intermolecular interactions such as solvation or hydrogen bonding. We can therefore use TVAS both to resolve dynamics on ground and excited states, and in principle to explore how solvation modifies the properties and dynamics of these states.</p>

        <span class="bold">Theis Sølling</span> asked: Did you see any indication that the triplet yield increased in the CHCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> because of a solvent heavy atom effect?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> replied: The triplet yield in 2′-deoxy-thymidine is modified by the chloroform solvent (see Table 4), but we do not think it is a result of an intermolecular heavy-atom effect on the singlet–triplet spin–orbit coupling interaction. Instead, we attribute this change to modifications to the intersections between the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* and T<small><sub>1</sub></small> (<small><sup>3</sup></small>ππ*) state caused by solvent-induced shifts of the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* state, and perhaps also to the rate of vibrational relaxation within the <small><sup>1</sup></small>nπ* state.</p>

        commented to Theis Sølling: In extension of Andrew Orr-Ewing’s response, one additional way in which triplet state features could be confirmed in our TVAS measurements on thymidine in chloroform, is to perform comparative quenching experiments in both Ar purged and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> saturated solutions. Although we have not presented these in our paper, previous TVAS studies of both thymine and thymidine in acetonitrile-d<small><sub>3</sub></small> by Kohler and co-workers (Ref. 11 in our paper)<small><sup>1</sup></small> have taken this approach and indeed confirm the quenching of triplet marker bands at 1603 and ~1700 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the carbonyl stretching region. These triplet bands are at similar wavenumbers to the bands we assign to a triplet state in chloroform (see Fig. 6 in our paper), which together with our frequency calculations gives us confidence in our assignment.</p>

        <span class="bold">Theis Sølling</span> addressed Andrew Orr-Ewing and Vasilios Stavros: It seems like the common denominator of the three presentations was the multiplicity of the states involved. How was the multiplicity determined?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vasilios Stavros</span> responded: For these types of measurements, the presence of triplet states could be determined by measuring, for example, phosphorescence. We attempted to measure phosphorescence in our experiment by cutting out the fluorescence in our signal (the addition of filters that absorb radiation).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Orr-Ewing</span> responded: We use both kinetic and spectroscopic information to identify IR bands of triplet-state molecules in our transient vibrational absorption spectroscopy measurements. We first identify IR bands of the ground electronic singlet state (S<small><sub>0</sub></small>) by steady-state FTIR spectroscopy of solutions of the molecule of interest. The T<small><sub>1</sub></small> state commonly has a much longer lifetime than excited singlet state molecules, so we then use the time constants for decay of transient bands (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> those that are not associated with the S<small><sub>0</sub></small> state) to guide identification of triplet state features. In the case of 2′-deoxy-thymidine, a &gt;1 ns lifetime for certain bands is indicative of T<small><sub>1</sub></small> state population. We also use high-level electronic structure calculations to assist in the assignment of transient IR spectral bands associated with excited singlet and triplet states. The calculated harmonic band frequencies generally need to be multiplied by a scaling factor to account for anharmonicity and the effects of a solvent. We determine the linear scaling factors by comparison of calculated frequencies with those measured by steady state FTIR of S<small><sub>0</sub></small> molecules, and apply the same scaling factors to computed frequencies for excited-state absorption bands. This procedure, in combination with the kinetic information, is usually sufficient to identify vibrational bands of excited singlet and triplet states.</p>
