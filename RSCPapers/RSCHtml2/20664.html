Due to the limitations of the traditional thermal approaches, several novel technologies are being developed. One promising approach in this field, which has received little attention to date, is plasma technology. Its advantages include mild operating conditions, easy upscaling, and gas activation by energetic electrons instead of heat. This allows thermodynamically difficult reactions, such as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting and the dry reformation of methane, to occur with reasonable energy cost. In this review, after exploring the traditional thermal approaches, we have provided a brief overview of the fierce competition between various novel approaches in a quest to find the most effective and efficient CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion technology. This is needed to critically assess whether plasma technology can be successful in an already crowded arena. The following questions need to be answered in this regard: are there key advantages to using plasma technology over other novel approaches, and if so, what is the flip side to the use of this technology? Can plasma technology be successful on its own, or can synergies be achieved by combining it with other technologies? To answer these specific questions and to evaluate the potentials and limitations of plasma technology in general, this review presents the current state-of-the-art and a critical assessment of plasma-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, as well as the future challenges for its practical implementation.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c6cs00066e-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

      <h2 id="sect492"><span class="a_heading">1. Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>Environmental and energy applications of low temperature plasmas are gaining increasing interest worldwide. The central research question is whether plasma-based solutions can yield a valuable alternative to existing thermal processes and whether they can compete with other novel gas conversion technologies. Nowadays, the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into chemicals and fuels is a hot topic. The worldwide transition to renewable energy gives plasma processes a clean electricity source, and due to their high operation flexibility, plasmas are very suitable for storing this intermittent renewable energy in a chemical form, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> as fuels and chemicals.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect498"><span class="b_heading">1.1. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mitigation and valorisation</span></h3>
        <span>Throughout history, the use of natural resources has played a major role in the rapid development of the human race. Among these resources, fossil fuels in particular have contributed to a fast and unprecedented development in human society. Still, this comes with a great cost, since burning fossil fuels leads to the emission of large amounts of the greenhouse gas CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Because these anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions outpace the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentrations have been increasing from 280 ppm since the beginning of the industrial revolution to 400 ppm in 2014.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> With high certainty, it can be said that it is this increase that has led to the current adverse global environmental climate changes,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> which have a growing detrimental effect on our climate and environment, and that represent a severe threat to our current society and future generations in general.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2–5</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">Therefore, the conversion of this main greenhouse gas into value-added chemicals and liquid fuels is considered as one of the main challenges for the 21st century.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2</span></sup></a> The aim is not only to tackle climate change, but also to provide an answer to our dependence on fossil fuels. As stated by Goeppert <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> “<span class="italic">Whether humankind uses up most of the fossil fuel resources (combined with carbon capture) or uses increasingly alternative energies, the need for transportation fuels and materials that we currently obtain from petroleum and natural gas will remain. With increasing population, products based on carbon from plastics to medicines will also be required in increasing quantities. In order to fulfil the demand for carbon-based products, CO</span><small><sub><span class="italic">2</span></sub></small><span class="italic">will have to be recycled in an anthropogenic version of nature's own carbon cycle. Carbon capture and recycling (CCR) will capture CO</span><small><sub><span class="italic">2</span></sub></small><span class="italic">from any source, and eventually mainly from the atmosphere, and recycle it to new materials and fuels using any alternative energy source.</span>”</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Utilization of this waste and converting it into a new feedstock not only complies with the framework of sustainable and green chemistry<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7,8</span></sup></a> but also fits within the ‘cradle-to-cradle’ concept.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> By generating useful products out of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> we create the possibility to effectively close the carbon loop. This has already resulted in a booming interest in technologies that can convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into value-added products,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10–12</span></sup></a> since they can effectively convert waste into new feedstocks following the cradle-to-cradle principle.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> Besides chemical conversion, which is the principle focus of this review, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> also has other applications in the field of carbon dioxide capture, storage and utilization, such as its fixation and technological utilization, for these and other processes, as well as in carbon capture, for which we refer to several existing reviews in the literature.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12–19</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Besides the traditional thermal CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, several alternative technologies are being investigated, such as electrochemical, solar thermochemical, photochemical and biochemical pathways, either with or without catalysts, as well as all their possible combinations.

        <h3 id="sect538"><span class="b_heading">1.2. Solar fuels</span></h3>
        <span>The important difference between the traditional thermal conversion approaches and the emerging technologies is their independence of burning fossil fuels to provide the necessary thermal heat to drive reactions. More precisely, biochemical pathways rely on the natural photosynthesis process to convert light (either natural or artificial) into biomass, which can then be harvested and further processed. Other emerging technologies, such as the solar thermochemical and photochemical processes rely on direct solar energy. The average solar flux striking the earth's surface is 175 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, which represents more energy striking the earth's surface in two hours, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 640 EJ, than the worldwide energy consumption from all sources combined in 2008, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 514 EJ.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> The solar thermochemical process makes use of concentrated solar heat, while the photochemical process relies on the energy of photons. Ultimately though, the electrochemical and plasmachemical processes rely on electricity. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> gives an overview of the different novel technologies and their principal use of renewable energy for the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in a carbon neutral cycle.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">The reliance of electrochemical and plasmachemical conversions on electricity at first seems to limit their use as a greenhouse gas mitigation technology, since currently, producing electricity generally results in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions. This idea though could not be further from the truth due to the worldwide transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. In 2014, the estimated renewable energy share of the global final energy consumption was already 19.2%, while by the end of 2015, the estimated renewable energy share of global electricity production was 23.7%.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> It is even at such a stage that the large-scale adoption of these renewable energy sources poses a challenge for the efficient storage and easy transport of the electricity produced, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> not only regarding the need for peak shaving, but more importantly the need for technologies to follow the irregular and at times intermittent supply of renewable electricity in a flexible way. While storage in batteries is possible, it is less efficient than chemical storage in fuels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> Such fuels, often referred to as carbon neutral fuels or solar fuels, offer a much higher gravimetric and volumetric energy storage capacity, have much higher energy densities than electrical storage techniques and they match the existing worldwide liquid fuel infrastructure.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,24</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the first instance, the reactions in which CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is involved can be divided into two categories: the production of chemicals and the production of fuels. The latter is considered as the most suitable target for the conversion of large volumes of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> since its market size is 12–14 times larger than the former. One of the most interesting compounds is methanol, which is positioned exactly in the middle of these two categories, being at the same time a raw chemical and a fuel, used in both combustion engines and fuel cells.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">To achieve the transformation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into value-added chemicals or fuels, the reactions that are of greatest interest involve the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with a co-reactant that acts as a hydrogen source (like CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> or H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O). Due to the existing infrastructure, liquid products are preferable to gases, for most applications at least. Two approaches can be considered to achieve this: the indirect oxidative pathway and the direct oxidative pathway. The main product of the former is syngas, a mixture of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO, which can be converted to almost any commercial bulk chemical or fuel in a second – albeit very energy intensively – step through methanol and/or Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> In this case, it is of great importance to have a high degree of control over the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio to be able to steer the synthesis towards the desired products.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> The direct oxidative pathway, on the other hand, tries to eliminate the energy-intensive middle man by converting the reactants immediately into hydrocarbons, short-chain olefins (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> ethylene and propylene) and oxygenated products (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> methanol, formaldehyde, dimethyl ether and formic acid).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Liquid products are more attractive over gaseous hydrogen, since – while in theory a ‘Hydrogen Economy’<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> would be very attractive – the latter has a number of serious drawbacks due to its physico-chemical properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> Furthermore, the infrastructure needed to safely transport, store and dispense hydrogen would be very expensive to roll out, while liquid chemicals match the already existing worldwide fuel infrastructure.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,24</span></sup></a> Hence, especially in the transportation sector, a transition from liquid–fossil-fuel-derived products (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene) to a renewable and sustainable liquid fuel is highly desirable. Again, methanol is one of the most interesting possible candidates to fulfil these requirements. It is the simplest liquid chemical containing only one carbon. Although to date it is almost exclusively produced from natural gas (and shale gas) for economic reasons, it can easily be obtained from several (future) carbon sources, incl. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, biomass, biogas and landfill gas. Therefore, it has been proposed as a key solar fuel for the above-mentioned anthropogenic carbon cycle under the framework of a ‘Methanol Economy’.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">To be economically competitive with the existing structures, the efficient production of these solar fuels is critical during the quest to find an effective CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion technology with the potential to be commercialized on a large scale.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect582"><span class="a_heading">2. Traditional thermal CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion approaches</span></h2>
      <span>We first briefly discuss the existing traditional (mainly thermocatalytic) approaches used on an industrial scale. As such, this section will act as a comparison for the novel technologies under development. This section is subdivided into: (1) pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting and (2) CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion in combination with a co-reactant, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> or H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect593"><span class="b_heading">2.1. Pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting</span></h3>
        <span>Thermal CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting has not been very effective to date. This is not surprising from a thermodynamic point of view; the carbon–oxygen bonds are relatively strong (783 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> and the Gibbs free energy of formation (Δ<span class="italic">G</span>° = −394 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> clearly shows that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is a highly stable molecule, requiring a substantial energy input, optimized reaction conditions and active catalysts for any chemical conversion to take place. Neither the entropy (<span class="italic">T</span>Δ<span class="italic">S</span>°) nor the enthalpy (Δ<span class="italic">H</span>°) term seem favourable for its conversion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> The overall reaction is written as:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn1"/><span id="eqn1">CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>(g) → CO(g) + 1/2O<small><sub>2</sub></small>(g) Δ<span class="italic">H</span>° = +283 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small></span></td><td class="rightEqn">(R1)</td></tr></table>Of course, the high value of Δ<span class="italic">H</span>° does not mean that its conversion is not feasible. Indeed, strongly endothermic chemical reactions can be found in a large number of industrial processes used worldwide, a classic example being the steam reforming of methane (SMR):<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24,31</span></sup></a><table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn2"/><span id="eqn2">CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>(g) + H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O(g) → CO(g) + 3H<small><sub>2</sub></small>(g) Δ<span class="italic">H</span>° = +206 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small></span></td><td class="rightEqn">(R2)</td></tr></table>This highly endothermic reaction has found worldwide use. In the fertilizer industry, the H<small><sub>2</sub></small> is used for the production of ammonia, while in the gas industry, this reaction is responsible for 95% of the worldwide H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production. This shows that there is no reason to dismiss CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting just because it is highly endothermic. Hence, a fair amount of research towards this reaction has already been conducted, of which an overview can be found in the work of Rayne.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">It is, however, clear that, without actively removing one of the products (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> CO or O<small><sub>2</sub></small>), the equilibrium of this reaction lies strongly to the left. Thus, thermal CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting is thermodynamically and energetically only favourable at very high temperatures, as can be seen in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>. At 2000 K for instance, the reaction is not very efficient: we can easily estimate that <span class="italic">ca.</span> 92 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> would be needed to heat 1 mole of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from 300 to 2000 K. Furthermore, the reaction enthalpy is equal to 245 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 2000 K. Based on a conversion of 1.5% at this temperature, the energy cost for the total conversion is ∼7.9 MJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, yielding an energy efficiency of only 4.4% with respect to the reaction enthalpy of 283 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 300 K. On the other hand, <span class="italic">ca.</span> 184 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> would be needed to heat 1 mole of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to 3500 K, and at this temperature the reaction enthalpy is equal to 206 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Hence, based on a conversion of 80% at this temperature, the energy cost of the total conversion is then only ∼602 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, yielding an energy efficiency of 47% with respect to the reaction enthalpy of 283 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 300 K.

        <h3 id="sect1254"><span class="b_heading">4.1. Properties of plasma and its unique features for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion</span></h3>
        <span>The term ‘plasma’ was first introduced by Irving Langmuir (1928). Plasma is an ionized gas, which means that at least one electron is unbound, creating positively charged ions. In practice, the ionization degree in plasma can vary from fully ionized gases (100%) to partially ionized gases (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small>–10<small><sup>−6</sup></small>). Besides the various types of ions (both positive and negative), plasma also consists of a large number of neutral species, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> different types of atoms, molecules, radicals and excited species. The latter can lead, among other things, to the emission of light. More importantly, all these species can interact with each other, making plasma a highly reactive and complex chemical cocktail, which is of interest to many potential applications.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21,78</span></sup></a> Indeed, plasmas can already be found in several applications in materials science (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> coating deposition, surface modification, nanomaterial fabrication) and in the microelectronics industry (for microchip manufacturing), but also as light sources, lasers and displays (owing to their light emitting characteristics) as well as for many emerging environmental and even medical applications (such as sterilization, wound treatment and even cancer treatment). More details about these applications can be found in the above-cited references, as well as in the references therein. In this review, however, we focus only on their application in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion into value-added chemicals and fuels.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Plasma is sometimes referred to as the ‘fourth state of matter’, owing to the observation that with increasing temperature matter transforms in the sequence: solid, liquid, (neutral) gas and finally an ionized gas or plasma. Although the concept of plasma is less known than the other states of matter, more than 99% of the visible matter in the universe is in the plasma state, mainly attributed to interstellar matter and the stars. Hence, our own sun is a perfect example of a plasma. Furthermore, basically, many – if not to say all – natural occurring weather phenomena emitting light are in fact plasma, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Saint Elmo's fire, lightning, red sprites, auroras (Borealis and Australis), where we must thank the excited species for the emission of these colourful lightshows. Other natural plasmas close to home are the earth's ionosphere, plasma sphere and the outer magnetosphere.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Beside these natural plasmas, we can distinguish between two main groups of man-made plasmas. The first ones are the high-temperature or fusion plasmas, which are in general completely ionized plasmas. Applications include tokomaks, stellarators, plasma pinches and focuses. The second group comprises the weakly ionized plasmas or so-called gas discharges, which are under study and covered in this review.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A second sub-division can be made based on whether the plasma is in thermal equilibrium or not. The temperature in a plasma is determined by the average energies of the different species (electrons, neutrals, ions) and their relevant degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, vibrational and electronic). Since plasma is a multicomponent system, it can exhibit multiple temperatures. When the temperature of all these species is the same in a localized area, the plasma is said to be in ‘local thermodynamic equilibrium’ (LTE), and these kinds of plasmas are usually called ‘thermal plasmas’. When the plasma is characterized by multiple different temperatures and thus is far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the plasma is said to be in ‘non-local thermodynamic equilibrium’ (non-LTE) and these discharges are usually called ‘non-thermal plasmas’.</p>

          <span id="sect1270"/><span class="c_heading_indent">4.1.1. Thermal plasmas. </span>
          <span>Thermal plasmas can be achieved in two ways, either at high temperature, typically ranging from 4000 K to 20<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 K, depending on the ease of ionization, or at high gas pressure. The latter can be explained as follows. Initially, the electrons receive energy from the electric field during their mean free path in between collisions, and they lose a small portion of this energy during collisions with so-called heavy particles (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> gas molecules or atoms). Subsequent collisions of this nature, also known as ‘Joule heating’, can lead to the temperatures changing to reach equilibrium between the electron and heavy particle temperature. At high pressures, the mean free path becomes smaller, so more collisions occur; hence, leading to a more efficient energy exchange between the electrons and the heavy particles. More specifically, it is the square of the ratio of the electric field (<span class="italic">E</span>) to the pressure (<span class="italic">p</span>), <span class="italic">i.e.</span> (<span class="italic">E</span>/<span class="italic">p</span>)<small><sup>2</sup></small>, which is proportional to the temperature difference in gas discharges.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a></span>

The heat source is also directional, with sharp interfaces and steep thermal gradients that can be controlled independently of the chemistry. Whereas the upper temperature limit when burning fossil fuels is 2300 K, thermal plasmas can reach temperatures of 20<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 K or more, as mentioned above.

          <span>In its simplest way, a non-thermal plasma is created by applying a potential difference between two parallel electrodes, which are inserted in a reactor filled with gas (or they form the reactor walls). This potential difference creates an electric field, which causes so-called gas breakdown, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the gas ‘breaks up’ (to some extent) into positive ions and electrons, although the majority of the gas molecules still remain neutral. The electrons are accelerated by this electric field towards the positive electrode (anode). When they collide with gas molecules, it can give rise to ionization, excitation and dissociation. The ionization collisions create new electrons and ions; the ions are accelerated by the electric field towards the negative electrode (cathode), where they cause secondary electron emission. The new electrons – created by ionization or secondary electron emission at the cathode – can then further give rise to further ionization collisions. These processes make the plasma self-sustaining. The excitation collisions create excited molecules, which can decay to the ground-state (or another lower level), thereby emitting light, which is one of the characteristic features of plasmas. Finally, the dissociation collisions create radicals, which can easily form new compounds, and this forms the basis of the gas conversion applications of non-thermal plasmas.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Although this way of plasma creation, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> by applying a potential difference between two electrodes, is only one possibility to create a plasma, the principle of gas activation by electrons, creating reactive species (ions, excited species, radicals) is equally valid for other types of plasmas as well, and will be discussed in Section 4.2 below. In general, this gas activation by electrons is also the reason for the good energy efficiency of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion by non-thermal plasmas, as will be explained below.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In non-thermal plasmas, the electrons are indeed characterized by a much higher temperature than the heavy particles, leading to the non-LTE condition, as mentioned above. As a result of all the different species, the relationship between all their different temperatures can become quite complex, but conventionally the temperature of the electrons (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>e</sub></small>) is the highest, followed by the vibrationally excited molecules (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>v</sub></small>), while the lowest temperature is shared by the neutral species (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>0</sub></small>, or simply the gas temperature, <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>g</sub></small>), the ions (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>i</sub></small>) and the rotational degrees of freedom of the molecules (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>r</sub></small>); hence the temperature order is: <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>e</sub></small> ≫ <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>v</sub></small> &gt; <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>r</sub></small> ≈ <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>i</sub></small> ≈ <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>0</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> In most cases, the electron temperature is in the order of 1 eV (∼10<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 K), while the gas temperature remains close to room temperature. This high electron temperature is due to the small mass of the electrons, allowing them to be easily accelerated by the applied electromagnetic fields, whereas the heavy particles – even the ions – are not easily accelerated. Furthermore, due to the large mass difference, the electrons lose less energy during elastic collisions with heavy particles, so they can easily keep their high energy gained from the electric field.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As mentioned above, the electrons can be considered as the initiators of the highly reactive chemical mixture. This is obviously one of the key advantages of non-thermal plasma technology: it allows gases – even as unreactive as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> – to be ‘activated’ at room temperature by the highly energetic electrons. Accordingly, there is no need to heat the entire reactor or the gas, because the discharge and the associated reactions are easily initiated by applying an electromagnetic field. This results in the second key advantage of non-thermal plasma technology for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, namely that it is a very flexible, or so-called turnkey, process, since it can easily and, more importantly, instantaneously be switched on and off, with conversion and product yield stabilization times generally lower than 30 minutes. Furthermore, its power consumption can easily be scaled and adjusted. As such, it has the inherent ability to be(come) one of the most suitable technologies to utilize excess intermittent renewable energy (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> energy originating from wind turbines or solar panels) and for storing it in a chemical form. Indeed, this makes it suitable for both peak shaving and, more importantly, grid stabilization, by being able to adapt to the irregular supply of renewable electricity. Hence, in essence the current transition to renewable energy sources not only gives plasma processes a clean electricity source, but plasma-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion technology can also provide a solution for the imbalance between energy supply and demand by enabling the storage of electrical energy in a desirable chemical form according to the market needs.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Additional advantages compared to the other emerging technologies for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion are the low investment cost for the reactors, as they do not rely on rare earth materials, and last but not least, their simple scalability from watt to megawatt applications, as already demonstrated by the successful development of ozone generators.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> Due to their extreme scalability, the applications can vary hugely in both scale and application type, starting from small devices, such as on board vehicles for exhaust treatment or to provide on board fuel cell feeds<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> as well as in household-scale devices for indoor air treatment,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82,83</span></sup></a> to medium on-demand installations, such as modular containerized plant concepts<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84</span></sup></a> or in <span class="italic">in situ</span> CO production,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> and finally to large-scale industrial plants. This scalability and flexibility in applications also gives plasma technology a high locational flexibility. As such, both production on demand and remote production become possible, which is a critical point for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) techniques.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, for the comparison made here with other novel technologies, the reliance of non-thermal plasma technology on indirect solar energy in the form of electricity is at the same time a limiting factor for the overall solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, compared to technologies that can harvest solar energy in a direct form. However, when looking at the broader picture, its ability to rely on multiple energy sources again gives plasma technology a huge advantage regarding locational flexibility, not to mention that it can be operated 24/7, even when the sun is not shining.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Although non-thermal plasma is good at creating a non-equilibrium condition by ‘activating’ stable molecules, it is absolutely non-selective in the formation of targeted products. More specifically, the reactive species created by the electrons react according to the laws of chemical kinetics, and as such, they recombine into a (large) number of different products, depending on the reaction conditions, not to mention that the formed products can again be destroyed by new electron collisions. For pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, this is not much of an issue, since CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> (together with small amounts of O<small><sub>3</sub></small>) are basically the only products that can be formed. However, when combining CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with other reactants, such as CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O or H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, a wide variety of products can be formed, including syngas (CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and higher hydrocarbons (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>, C<small><sub>3</sub></small>H<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>, C<small><sub>4</sub></small>H<small><sub><span class="italic">z</span></sub></small>) as well as several oxygenates, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and carboxylic acids. For that reason, the combination with catalysis is also highly desirable for plasma technology when targeting the selective production of specific compounds (see Section 4.3).</p>

          <p class="otherpara">From <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11</a>, it is clear that the value of the reduced electric field will have wide implications on the distribution of the electron energy among the different channels. In the region above 200 Td, 70–80% of the electron energy goes into electronic excitation, about 5% is transferred to dissociation, 5% is used for ionization (increasing with <span class="italic">E</span>/<span class="italic">n</span>), while only 10% goes into vibrational excitation (decreasing with <span class="italic">E</span>/<span class="italic">n</span>). Around 50 Td, however, only 10% goes into electronic excitation and 90% of the energy goes into vibrational excitations. It is important to keep in mind that the addition of different gases (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ar, He, N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) has an influence on the distribution of these channels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> Hence, even during the pure decomposition of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small>, there will be an effect on this distribution.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The distribution of energy into different modes, and especially the fraction going into vibrational excitation, is very important, since, as mentioned above, it is known that the vibrational levels of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can play an important role in the efficient dissociation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. To achieve direct electron-impact dissociation, an electron needs to have enough energy (&gt;7 eV) to excite CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into a dissociative (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> repulsive) electronic state, which will lead to its dissociation into CO and O (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12</a>).

Due to the special nature of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecule, a more efficient dissociation pathway is based on its vibrational excitation.

Characteristic features are the wavelength (815 MHz or 2.45 GHz), which is comparable to the length of the apparatus, and the short period of the exciting microwave field. Surface-wave discharges can be created both at reduced and at atmospheric pressure, but in the pressure regime above 0.1 atm they approach a state of LTE.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a></p>

          <span>A gliding arc (GA) discharge is also a warm plasma, combining advantages of both thermal and non-thermal plasma systems.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> It is a transient type of arc discharge. At high currents, the periodic discharge typically evolves during one cycle from an arc to a strongly non-equilibrium discharge. The non-equilibrium GA is a very sophisticated physical phenomenon: this transitional quasi-equilibrium/non-equilibrium discharge is essentially non-uniform in time and in space, and includes an internal transition from thermal to non-thermal mechanisms of ionization.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">A classical GA plasma is an auto-oscillating periodic discharge, where the gas flows between two diverging flat electrodes. When applying a potential difference between both electrodes, an arc plasma is formed at the narrowest gap, which is then dragged by the gas flow towards a rising interelectrode distance, until it extinguishes and a new arc is ignited at the shortest interelectrode gap. More specifically, the length of the arc column increases together with the voltage until it exceeds its critical value (<span class="italic">l</span><small><sub>crit</sub></small>). At this point, heat losses from the plasma column begin to exceed the supplied energy and it is no longer possible to sustain the plasma in its LTE state, resulting in a fast transition into a non-LTE state. The discharge cools rapidly to gas temperature but the plasma conductivity is maintained by a high value of the electron temperature (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>e</sub></small> ∼ 1 eV, which is most suitable for efficient vibrational excitation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>). After this fast transition, the GA continues its evolution under non-LTE conditions, until the length reaches a new critical value (<span class="italic">l</span> ∼ 3·<span class="italic">l</span><small><sub>crit</sub></small>), leading to decay of the discharge, after which the evolution repeats from the initial breakdown. During this cycle, up to 75–80% of the energy can be dissipated in the non-LTE zone of the gliding arc. It is this effect that permits the stimulation of chemical reactions in regimes quite different from conventional thermal reaction chemistry. When the GA is operated under milder conditions, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> lower currents and high frequencies, this transition to the non-LTE phase can occur in the order of nanoseconds. As a result, the GA operates in the non-LTE regime starting almost immediately after its ignition, and a higher fraction of the discharge energy can be consumed by the non-LTE phase.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97–99</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">The classical GA plasma, however, also exhibits some disadvantages. The flat 2D electrode geometry makes it less compatible with industrial systems, and also the gas conversion is non-uniform and quite limited, because a considerable fraction of the gas does not pass through the active plasma region. Moreover, a high gas flow rate is needed to drag the arc, so the gas residence time is limited, thereby further limiting the conversion. Therefore, a 3D cylindrical GA plasma reactor was developed a few years ago, which makes use of vortex flow stabilization.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> The gas flows in the reactor through a tangential inlet. An arc is again formed between both electrodes, and is dragged with the tangential gas flow, thereby expanding until it extinguishes, followed by a new cycle. Basically, the arc is again gliding between the anode and cathode, and it is stabilized in the centre of the reactor. Depending on the diameter of the anode tube, a forward or reverse vortex gas flow is created. If the anode diameter is equal to the cathode diameter, the gas can leave the reactor through the anode outlet, leading only to a forward vortex flow. On the other hand, if the anode diameter is smaller than the cathode diameter, the gas cannot immediately leave the reactor, and will first flow upwards close to the walls, in a forward vortex. As this gas is still cold, it creates an isolating and cooling effect, protecting the reactor walls from the warm plasma arc in the centre. When it reaches the upper end of the reactor, it will have lost some speed due to friction and inertia, and when flowing downwards, it moves in a smaller inner vortex, a so-called reverse vortex, where it mixes with the plasma arc, resulting in a more energy-efficient conversion. The reverse vortex flow GA is also called a ‘gliding arc plasmatron’ (GAP). <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15</a> shows the difference between these two types of GAs.</p>

          <span>Besides the above three main discharge types for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, some research is also being carried out with other plasma types, which are briefly discussed here. These include radio frequency (RF) discharges, several different atmospheric pressure glow discharges (APGD), corona discharges, spark discharges and nanosecond pulsed discharges.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">RF discharges usually operate in the 1–100 MHz frequency range, resulting in a corresponding wavelength (300–3 m) much larger than the plasma reactor dimensions. The power coupling can be done through capacitive or inductive coupling, resulting in capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP). These kind of discharges are mainly applied to thin-film deposition, plasma etching, the sputtering of materials and as an ion source in mass spectrometry,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> but some research is also being performed for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion applications, as is illustrated in Section 5. An RF source operating at low pressure, both with and without the influence of an external magnetic field, has been used. The advantages for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion are its capability to allow obtaining high electron densities at low gas temperature.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">When a sufficiently large electric field is applied, corona discharges occur near sharp points, edges or thin wires when used as an electrode. When a high negative voltage is applied to the electrode, it acts as a cathode and is considered as a negative corona discharge. When a positive voltage is applied, it is considered as a positive corona discharge. Corona discharges are always non-uniform, with a strong electric field, ionization and luminosity close to the wire/sharp electrode, whereas the charged particles are dragged to the other electrode by weak electric fields. They are often operated in a pulsed mode, mostly to increase the power, while inhibiting the transition of the streamer formation into sparks.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> An advantage of corona discharges compared to DBDs is that they are relatively easy to establish; however, their performance in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion processes is quite similar, as will become clear from Section 5.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">When a streamer is able to connect two electrodes, without the presence of a pulsed power supply (see corona discharge above) or the presence of a dielectric (see DBD), a spark discharge can develop by further growth of the current.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> However, when the amount of power provided is restricted, the discharge cannot develop into a stationary (thermal) arc and instead the discharge extinguishes within several hundred microseconds. Hence, spark discharges consist of an initiation of streamers that develop into highly energetic spark channels, which then extinguish and reignite periodically. Lightning is a typical example of a spark discharge.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A wide variety of plasma set-ups fall under APGDs, such as miniaturized direct current (dc) GDs, microhollow cathode dc discharges and RF discharges as well as DBDs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> The main advantage of APGDs is the absence of vacuum conditions compared to with regular glow discharges, and also operating without elevated temperatures. Depending on the gas mixture and electrode configuration, the discharge can operate in a stable homogeneous glow or filamentary glow mode. For example, a DBD can operate in APGD mode, and in this case the discharge benefits from the average power densities of a DBD but operating in a uniform homogeneous glow mode, thus benefiting uniform gas treatment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> This discharge is interesting for DRM due to its special characteristics of electron density (3 × 10<small><sup>12</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>), electron temperature (∼2 eV, suitable for the vibrational excitation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and plasma gas temperature (900 K), which is lower than that of thermal plasma but higher than that of DBDs and corona discharges.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Finally, nanosecond pulsed discharges are basically discharges that rely on repetitively pulsed excitation, through a nanosecond scale pulse rise time and duration. This leads to a highly non-LTE state with very high plasma densities for a relatively low power consumption due to the short pulse durations. Whereas (sub)microsecond pulsed discharges are initiated by Townsend discharges, nanosecond pulsed discharges ignite instantaneously, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> without the involvement of secondary electrons. Furthermore, the discharge remains in a glow-like (rather than filamentary) mode despite the high electric field. The interest in shorter pulses is not because of the duration of the discharge itself, but rather because they offer better control of the electron energy than continuous wave discharges, depending on the pulse length.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> Thus, more energy can be directed towards the desired dissociation channels.</p>

        <h3 id="sect1522"><span class="b_heading">4.3. Plasma-catalysis</span></h3>
        <span>As with most of the technologies described in Section 3, plasma set-ups can also be combined with a packing material or catalyst, giving rise to plasma-catalysis. Plasma-catalysis is an emerging branch of plasma processing at the interface of a variety of disciplines, including physical chemistry, material science, nanotechnology, catalysis, plasma physics and plasma chemistry. In short, its objective is to enhance plasma reactions by adding a catalyst to the reaction cycle and vice versa. Theoretically speaking, combining plasma with catalysis offers the best of both worlds. Inert molecules are activated by the plasma under mild conditions, and subsequently the activated species selectively recombine at the catalyst surface to yield the desired products. This will be especially important to further advance and optimize the direct oxidative liquefaction pathway of plasmachemical CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, in order to selectively produce the desired liquid products. In this section, we present a brief overview of the different approaches and possible interactions between the plasma and the catalyst. For more extensive details, we refer to several broad reviews on this specific topic that have recently been published.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit83"><sup><span class="sup_ref">83,102–104</span></sup></a></span>

          <span>Plasmas and catalysts can be combined in two main configurations, as illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16</a>. In the first, the so-called two-stage configuration (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(b)</a>), the catalyst is spatially separated from the plasma region, either upstream or downstream, but the main configuration is downstream. In the second, the so-called one-stage configuration (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(c)</a>), the catalyst is placed inside the discharge region. In a traditional thermal catalysis experiment, molecules are dissociatively adsorbed onto the catalyst with the energy being supplied in the form of heat. In plasma-assisted catalysis, species are activated by the plasma due to excitation, ionization or dissociation by electrons in the gas phase or on the catalyst surface.</span>

          <p class="otherpara">The major difference between the one-stage and two-stage configuration is the kind of species to which the catalyst is exposed. In the two-stage configuration, the end-products and the long-lived intermediates will interact with the catalyst, while in the one-stage configuration, the catalyst can also interact with all the short-lived species, including excited species, radicals, photons and electrons. Furthermore, in this configuration the catalyst may also be influenced by the plasma and <span class="italic">vice versa</span> (see below). Besides plasma-catalysis, the preparation and modification of catalysts by plasma treatment is gaining increased attention, especially for catalysts with a low thermal stability.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit103"><sup><span class="sup_ref">103</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">The most widely investigated and, for this review, most interesting configuration is the one-stage configuration, in which the catalyst is placed inside the discharge region, either completely or only partially occupying the discharge zone. The catalyst itself can be introduced in the discharge as pellets, (fine) powders, foams, honeycomb monoliths, different electrode materials and electrode coatings or as coated quartz wool. The ease of adding a catalyst into the discharge zone greatly varies depending on the type of plasma reactor used. In general, due to their simple geometry and operation close to room temperature, implementation of a catalyst in a DBD reactor is very easy. Although MWs also have a simple geometry, due to the high gas temperature inside the discharge zone (1000–2000 K compared to 300–400 K for DBD) catalysts are often placed downstream, due to their low thermal stability. Finally, GA discharges have rather complex geometries and the same higher gas temperatures, thus catalysts are typically introduced downstream, although the use of a spouted bed has also been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit105"><sup><span class="sup_ref">105</span></sup></a> If these MW and GA discharges can be operated at slightly lower temperatures (≤1000 K), this would yield new possibilities. It would also open up the way for using sufficiently thermally stable catalysts inside the discharge zone, and at the same time it would allow thermal activation of catalysts inside the discharge zone by the plasma.</p>

This surplus effect, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17</a>, is a complex phenomenon originating from the interplay between the various plasma–catalyst interactions and is often termed ‘synergy’, when the combined effect is larger than the sum of the two separate effects.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> Note that most research to date regarding this effect has been performed for DBDs.</span>

          <p class="otherpara">The complex interactions can be subdivided into two categories: the effects of the plasma on the catalyst, and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>, the effects of the catalyst on the plasma.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102,107</span></sup></a> Second, it is important to distinguish between the two types of effects: physical and chemical effects. While the physical effects are mainly responsible for gaining a better energy efficiency, the chemical effects can lead to an improved selectivity towards the targeted products. In the case of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, mainly CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> are formed, so the primary added value of the catalyst is to increase the energy efficiency, although the conversion can also be improved by chemical effects, such as enhanced dissociative chemisorption due to the catalyst acid/basic sites. When adding a co-reactant (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>), the catalyst allows modifying the selectivity towards the targeted products.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An overview of the plasma–catalyst interactions is given in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18</a>. When adding a catalyst, the following effects on the plasma have been reported: (i) an enhancement of the electric field through the geometric distortion and surface roughness; (ii) the formation of micro-discharges inside the pores of the catalyst material, due to the very strong electric field inside the pores, leading to different characteristics compared to the bulk; (iii) a change in the discharge type, because the presence of insulating surfaces promotes the development of surface discharges; (iv) the adsorption of species on the catalyst surface, which affects their concentration and conversion due to longer retention times. All the effects of the catalyst on the plasma can thus generally be considered as physical effects. The reported effects of the plasma on the catalyst, on the other hand, are of both a physical and chemical nature. They include: (i) changes in its physico-chemical properties, such as a higher adsorption probability at the catalyst surface, a higher catalyst surface area, a changed catalyst oxidation state, the reduction of metal oxide catalysts to their metallic form, reduced coke formation on the surface and a change in the catalyst work function; (ii) the formation of hot spots on the surface due to the formation of strong micro-discharges; (iii) catalyst activation by photon irradiation emitted by the excited plasma species (although this effect is probably of only minor importance due to the low photon fluxes); (iv) lowered activation barriers due to there being more reactive vibrationally excited plasma species and consequently a greater possibility for non-adiabatic barrier crossings; (v) changes in the reaction pathways due to the presence of a wide variety of (re)active species.</p>

      <h2 id="sect1644"><span class="a_heading">5. Critical assessment of plasma-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion</span></h2>
      <span>In this section, we address the present state-of-the-art with respect to plasma-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, focusing on a critical assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the various set-ups described in Section 4.2. The aim is to unveil their future challenges, risks and opportunities for successful implementation. Several options are being investigated, including both pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting into CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small>, as well as the reaction with other gases, such as CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> (the dry reforming of methane), H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O (artificial photosynthesis) and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> (hydrogenation). By adding a hydrogen source, the main aim is to produce value-added chemicals and/or fuels, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> syngas, hydrocarbons and valuable oxygenates, such as methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid. As mentioned above in Section 4, most research on plasma-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion is performed with DBDs, MW and GA plasmas, with a main focus on improving the energy efficiency of the conversion, as well as the selectivity towards value-added chemicals, in combination with catalysis.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">In order for plasma technology to be competitive with traditional as well as emerging novel technologies (as described in Sections 2 and 3) we can define two main goals. First, plasma technology will have to be competitive with electrolysis, which is its main competitor and that also has the same advantage as being able to rely on all sorts of renewable electricity. For electrochemical water splitting, commercial energy efficiencies of 65–75% have been obtained; hence, the goal of plasma technology should be at least to aim for an energy efficiency comparable to this, and better than the thermal equilibrium energy efficiency limits of ∼45–50% (see Section 2). Second, when comparing with other novel technologies that can make use of direct solar energy, such as solar thermochemical conversion, we should look at the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency. As such, for novel technologies, a solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of approximately 20% is considered industrially competitive, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> when looking at the production of syngas,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> as will be elaborated in Section 6.3 below. When relying on solar energy, taking a solar panel efficiency of 25%<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> and a plasma-conversion energy efficiency of 60–80% towards the syngas components CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, this would yield a competitive solar-to-fuel efficiency of 15–20%. Hence, in the following critical assessment of plasma-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion technology, we should keep in mind that – from an energy efficiency point of view – to be considered as a competitive and worthy alternative, plasma technology should aspire to an energy efficiency of at least 60%, at least when focusing on the production of syngas.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, the conversion of syngas into more suitable fuels and chemicals through the Fischer–Tropsch process or for methanol synthesis (and subsequently for methanol or ethanol to olefin) is a very energy-intensive process. As a result, the energy efficiency requirements for the direct production of these compounds is highly dependent on the formed products. Hence, the target energy cost to be competitive can be significantly lower for a direct one-step process. For example, a solar-to-methanol conversion efficiency of 7.1% is already economically feasible.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> In this case, a plasma-conversion energy efficiency of 30% (instead of the above 60%) would already suffice. This is very important and it shows that, in contrast to the indirect approach through syngas, for the direct oxidative pathway – which aims to synthesize oxygenated liquid products in one step – the energy efficiency target is much lower, depending on the products formed, due to the circumvention of the energy-intensive step of converting syngas into the desired liquids. The possibility to proceed through this direct oxidative pathway is one of the key benefits of plasma technology, and in theory this pathway is the most promising. For now, however, a lot of research is still needed to understand the underlying processes, in order to improve the yield of the desired (oxygenated) liquid products.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> Hence, the analysis in this section is based on the production of the syngas components CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> using plasma technology, based on the energy efficiency target of 60%. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that this 60% energy efficiency target applies to syngas production, but this target would change completely, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it would decrease by a factor two to three, if a direct oxidative pathway towards liquids could be successfully realized using plasma technology.</p>

        <span>As outlined in Section 4 above, in the case of pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, the dominant products are CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> in a 2-to-1 ratio. Hence, this is a simple chemical process and there are no concerns regarding the complexity and the wide variety of products that can be formed – such as in the case with an added H-source – and thus one does not have to contemplate how to steer the different selectivities. As such, the research can solely focus on optimizing the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and the energy efficiencies, and will be judged on those indicators.</span>

          <span>Although many papers are already published on CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion by DBD, detailed systematic studies presenting values for both the conversion and energy efficiency in a DBD appear to be very scarce. The most detailed studies focusing on a wide range of conditions were performed by Aerts <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> Paulussen <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> Yu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> and Ozkan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> We combine the most important observations from these works and complement them with various other findings in the literature, to sketch a complete image with the data available to date.</span>

Furthermore, extensive modelling has also been performed to obtain a more fundamental insight into the plasma chemistry in a DBD and in turn to aid in the improvement of future experiments. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20</a> summarizes most of the data available in the literature. From this figure, several main trends become clear. First of all, the conversion increases with increasing specific energy input (SEI), while the energy efficiency generally decreases with increasing SEI, especially above an SEI of 10 eV per molecule. When plotting the energy efficiency as a function of the conversion, it is clear that most of the results are situated below an energy efficiency of 15% and a conversion of 40%, with some exceptions. The highest conversions of 42% were obtained for packed-bed DBDs while the highest energy efficiency of 23% was obtained with a pulsed power DBD. It is important to note that some of the data in this figure has been recalculated to represent coherent values for the conversions and energy efficiencies. For instance, in plasma research, the mixture is sometimes diluted with He, Ar or N<small><sub>2</sub></small> to obtain an more easily ignitable and more stable discharge, but as will be mentioned below, this influences the results – an effect that was, among others, not always taken into account in the original data.

          <p class="otherpara">It is well known that the specific energy input (SEI), which is defined as the plasma power divided by the gas flow rate, is the dominant determining factor for the conversion and energy efficiency.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95,114,115,118</span></sup></a> It has also been observed that the same values of SEI defined by different combinations of plasma power and gas flow rate can result in different conversions. It is the gas flow rate, and hence the residence time, which has the most important effect, while the effect of the power is less significant. As such, a lower power with a lower gas flow rate will result in a higher conversion and energy efficiency than a higher power with a higher gas flow rate for the same SEI.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95,115</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Some possible geometry modifications are the discharge length and discharge gap. Yu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> found that varying the discharge length for a fixed SEI has no significant effect on the discharge characteristics, the conversion and the energy efficiency. On the other hand, the discharge gap appears to affect the discharge behaviour, and thus also the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion. Aerts <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> found that above a certain gap width (3.3 mm in their case) less streamer formation occurs, leading to a decrease in the effective plasma volume, and hence lower conversions and efficiencies result.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, Aerts <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> also reported that the applied frequency seems to have a negligible effect on the conversion and energy efficiency. However, the plasma appears more filamentary at high frequency (75 kHz) compared to at low frequency (6 kHz). Ozkan <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> however, found that both the conversion and energy efficiency decrease slightly upon increasing the frequency from 15 to 30 kHz. This was explained by Paulussen <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> who suggested that the optimum discharge frequency depends on the power input, and as such it cannot be unambiguously stated that higher or lower frequencies give rise to an increased CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and energy efficiency.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In thermochemical reactions, the gas temperature is one of the most important parameters governing the reaction rates. For the plasma-based conversion in a DBD, however, the effect of temperature is not so clear. Paulussen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> observed a slight and linear increase in the conversion from 26% to 28.5% when the inlet gas was heated from 303 K to 443 K. Ozkan <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> on the other hand, reported that the wall and gas temperature should remain as low as possible. In addition, Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> detected an increase in conversion of 0.5–3% when using an external fan to cool the reactor, and they suggested that higher flow rates are preferred, since the latter remove large amounts of heat from the reactor. Brehmer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> noted a big effect of the wall temperature on the O<small><sub>3</sub></small> density and suggested that the recombination of CO and O on the wall would also increase with rising wall temperatures.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The effect of the dielectric material used in the DBD reactor is another topic of debate. By studying the formation of a conductive coating, Belov <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> observed that the conductivity of the dielectric might be the most crucial parameter affecting the discharge properties. However, Aerts <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> reported no significant effect between quartz or alumina under a wide range of conditions, although it was still concluded that alumina has several advantages in terms of reactor stability. Ozkan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> found that alumina and quartz perform better than mullite and Pyrex, and that a thicker dielectric leads to a higher conversion and energy efficiency.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> More sophisticated dielectric materials were created and tested by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120,121</span></sup></a> and Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> The former investigated the influence of Ca<small><sub>0.8</sub></small>Sr<small><sub>0.2</sub></small>TiO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (CST) with 0.5 wt% Li<small><sub>2</sub></small>Si<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> as the dielectric barrier and achieved an improvement in the conversion by a factor 9 of up to 9, compared to silica glass. Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> investigated the performance of CST ceramics with various amounts of CaO–B<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>–SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (CBS) glass addition (0.5–5 wt%), and found that the addition of 5.0 wt% CBS resulted in an increase in the conversion by a factor of 2.6, while the energy efficiency almost tripled compared to that with 0.5 wt% CBS. However, from the calculation of the plasma power in both studies, it appears that the more sophisticated dielectrics mainly increased the efficiency between the input power and plasma power, and not the effective plasma-conversion energy efficiency. Nevertheless, these dielectrics allowed operation under lower voltages, which could be beneficial for certain processes. In summary, different dielectrics may allow for easier igniting and streamer formation, but not necessarily more energy-efficient plasma-conversion chemistry.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Besides the dielectric material, also the electrode material can be varied. Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> studied the effect of changing – or coating – the high voltage electrode and obtained an order of activity as Cu &gt; Au &gt; Rh &gt; Fe ∼ Pt ∼ Pd. The Cu and Au electrodes yielded a relative increase in the conversion by a factor 1.5 compared to an Fe electrode. Furthermore, the maximum energy efficiency of the Au electrode was almost three times higher than the energy efficiency of the Rh electrode under the same conditions. However, besides the fact that some of these electrodes or coatings are more expensive, compared to the inert stainless steel electrode, they also are susceptible to chemical erosion (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> oxidation) and plasma sputtering (as observed for Au).</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As mentioned above, some researchers have also added inert gases, such as N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Ar and He, to ignite the plasma more easily. This also has several effects on the discharge characteristics, conversion, energy efficiency and even by-product formation in the case of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The addition of He and Ar leads to an increase in the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, but the effective conversion decreases, since there is less CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> present in the mixture and the increased conversion is not sufficient to counteract this drop in the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fraction. As a result, the energy efficiency decreases as well.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118,123,124</span></sup></a> The addition of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, on the other hand, shows a completely different behaviour. Snoeckx <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> discovered that the presence of N<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the gas mixture of up to 50% barely influences the effective CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and the corresponding energy efficiency.

However, the best results of this earlier work<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21,139,140</span></sup></a> have not yet been reproduced to date, while the best energy efficiency in the more recent work appears to be around the thermodynamic equilibrium value of 45–50%. This observation, together with the reported gas temperatures, makes it questionable whether vibrational excitation plays the major role here. Nonetheless, from modelling insights,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88,89</span></sup></a> it is evident that when the set-up can be tailored to achieve the correct strong non-equilibrium conditions,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141</span></sup></a> vibrational excitations can lead to energy efficiencies of up to 90%.

          <span>It is evident that both DBD and MW discharges have their distinctive advantages and disadvantages. DBDs operate at atmospheric pressure, but cannot make use of the most energy-efficient dissociation process by vibrational interactions, while MW discharges can, but the vibrational pathways are only fully exploited when they operate at reduced pressure. The GA set-up tries to combine the best of both worlds, offering the possibility to operate at atmospheric pressure and at the same time trying to reach a strong enough non-equilibrium to stimulate the most efficient dissociation process through vibrational excitation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">As explained in Section 4.2.3, there are two main GA reactor geometries used for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion. The first one relies on simple two-dimensional (2D) electrode blades. However, this configuration has a few disadvantages: the residence time in the plasma is quite short, flow rates are more limited and, due to its geometry, only a limited fraction of the gas flow is processed by the discharge (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> about 20% depending on the actual geometry).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97,156,157</span></sup></a> As a result, this limits the theoretical maximum possible conversion to ∼20%.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> The GAP configuration, on the other hand, is based on cylindrical electrodes, and the gas follows a vortex flow pattern. The gas in the reverse (inner) vortex flow passes exactly through the arc in the longitudinal direction, which ensures longer residence times in the discharge zone, even at high flow rates. Based on the gas flow calculations, about 40% of the gas flow can be processed by the discharge,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">158</span></sup></a> doubling the theoretical maximum conversion compared to the classical 2D electrode configuration.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Beside these geometry variations, other work has focused on changing the applied power, gas flow rate, flow type, interelectrode gap, admixture gases and plasma chemistry modelling. Again, all the data available in the literature are plotted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22</a>. Most experiments report a maximum energy efficiency of around 40–50%,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97,100,159</span></sup></a> with the highest experimentally reported and also calculated energy efficiency being 65%.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97,160</span></sup></a> Most of the conversion results, however, remain below 15%, for both the regular GA and the GAP set-ups.

          <p class="otherpara">It should be no surprise that again a trade-off between the energy efficiency and conversion as a function of SEI is observed.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97,100,159,161,162</span></sup></a> In general, the conversion increases and the energy efficiency decreases with increasing the SEI, as can be seen in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22</a>, and the same optimal SEI range of 0.1–1 eV per molecule, in terms of energy efficiency, is observed as for the MW discharges.

          <p class="otherpara">Besides the gas flow rate, an important parameter for the GAP is the vortex flow type, which can be modulated by adjusting the reactor geometry.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100,159,163</span></sup></a> Operating in a reversed vortex flow (RVF), compared to a forward vortex flow (FVF), provides an increase in residence time and thermal insulation of the discharge from the reactor walls.

          <p class="otherpara">For the regular GA, the interelectrode gap can be varied to improve the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, and the best result was observed for the smallest interelectrode distance.

          <p class="otherpara">Only one research group has reported the use of additive gases, other than CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O or H<small><sub>2</sub></small>; more specifically, the addition of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and air.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> The experiments revealed that adding N<small><sub>2</sub></small> had a positive effect on the conversion (up to a factor 2 upon the addition of 95% N<small><sub>2</sub></small>), but due to the dilution, a detrimental effect on the energy efficiency was observed (down by a factor of 10–20). Furthermore, the presence of N<small><sub>2</sub></small> leads to the unwanted production of NO<small><sub>X</sub></small>. The addition of O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and air showed a decrease in the conversion, indicating the possible strong negative effect of the presence of O<small><sub>2</sub></small> (impurities), presumably due to Le Chatelier's principle.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Due to the more complex behaviour of the gas flow and of the arc movement, and also the relationship between both in a GA, modelling work is more limited in the literature.

          <p class="otherpara">In summary, the data in the literature show that GA discharges succeed in exploiting the most energy-efficient CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissociation channel based on vibrational excitation, while operating at atmospheric pressure. Energy efficiencies of 45% are no exception and even results above the target value of 60% have already been reported. On the other hand, model calculations reveal that the non-equilibrium character of the GA – making full potential of the vibrational excitation/dissociation pathway – could be further exploited to improve the energy efficiency. Just like for MW discharges, operating GA plasmas at lower gas temperatures might be the key for achieving this. In addition, the main limiting factor compared to MW discharges appears to be the conversion, due to the limited fraction of the gas flow that is currently processed by the discharge. Smart reactor design, such as enhancing the processed gas fraction, should lead to the necessary advancements to overcome this limitation in the future.</p>

When available, the relevant data have been extracted from the literature and the results are presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23</a>. In general, the performance of all these different discharges is similar to that observed for a DBD, with maximum conversions of up to 40% and energy efficiencies below 15%.

          <p class="otherpara">First of all, it is clear that, although DBDs are among the most extensively studied for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, and indeed are already successfully applied<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> for commercial O<small><sub>3</sub></small> production and VOC removal, they appear to be unsuitable for the efficient conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Their energy efficiency remains a factor of 4 too low, even when combined with a packing, in order to justify them as industrially competitive. The same applies to most of the other plasma types listed in Section 5.1.4 above.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Second, the best results for GA plasmas are capable of reaching the set energy efficiency target, namely 60%. Moreover, almost all of the results obtained are far above the thermal equilibrium limit, which is especially interesting, keeping in mind that the GA plasmas operate at atmospheric pressure. This demonstrates the non-equilibrium character of this type of plasma, even at atmospheric pressure, and the benefits of being able to exploit this behaviour through the energy-efficient dissociation of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> vibrational levels. Moreover, modelling has revealed that this non-equilibrium character could (and should) be further exploited, to further enhance the energy efficiency. To date, the main challenge is the limited conversion, which remains below 20% because only a limited fraction of the gas passes through the active arc plasma.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Finally, if, for now, we ignore the fact that most MW discharges used for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion operate at reduced pressure, in contrast to the commercially more interesting atmospheric pressure of GA plasmas, it is clear that MW discharges offer a wide variety of possibilities. Even up to conversions of 40%, the energy efficiency target is easily crossed and they clearly operate in a non-equilibrium regime, thus favouring the step-wise vibrational-dissociation mechanism. Conversions in the range of 40–90% are also possible, albeit with maximum energy efficiencies of only up to 40%. Under these conditions, the MW discharges most probably operate in the thermal regime. Nevertheless, this shows the wide variety of both conversions and energy efficiencies achievable with MW discharges for the conversion of pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>

        <span>Contrary to pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, DRM can yield a wide variety of products. This has several implications for the evaluation and comparison of the various studies in the literature, mainly because it affects the definition of the energy efficiency. To determine the true energy efficiency of the process, we would need to take all the formed products into account – both gaseous and liquids – to determine the theoretical reaction enthalpy. Another possibility would be to determine the thermal energy efficiency (see Section 6), based on the higher (or lower) heating value of the output, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the products, relative to that of the input, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the reactants and power input. However, typically only the selectivity (or yield) towards the syngas components, CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and light hydrocarbons is given for most studies in the literature. Thus, at the moment these strategies are impossible to pursue when presenting an overview of the available literature results in the sections below. Therefore, in this section, we use the energy cost, in units of eV per converted molecule, to compare the different discharges, together with their total conversion. As an energy efficiency target for syngas production, we take the same 60% value for the general stoichiometric DRM process, which equals an energy cost of 4.27 eV per molecule converted. Indeed, 100% energy efficiency would yield an energy cost equal to the standard reaction enthalpy of 2.56 eV per molecule (as outlined in Section 2.2.1). In our opinion, this is the best representation to compare the results in the literature, considering the fact that in most of the studies, the higher hydrocarbons and the valuable liquid fraction containing oxygenates (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, formic acid, acetic acid) are neglected. However, as explained at the beginning of Section 5, this 60% energy efficiency target is only valid for the comparison towards syngas production. When liquids (such as methanol) are formed through the direct oxidative pathway, which has already been demonstrated using the plasmachemical conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with a co-reactant, the energy efficiency requirements are drastically lowered by a factor of two to three. This is a direct result of circumventing the energy-intensive step of further processing the syngas into the desired liquid products.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Plasma-based DRM has received a lot of attention in recent years. Some overviews can be found in the literature.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21,41,177–179</span></sup></a> In a recent review on the liquefaction of methane,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> DRM was considered as oxidative plasma-based CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> liquefaction. It can be performed in two ways: either as a two-step process, yielding mainly syngas, which can then be further processed into Fischer–Tropsch liquids or methanol, or as a one-step process, aiming for the direct formation of value-added oxygenated products, such as formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether and formic acid. These two options are therefore called the indirect and direct oxidative plasma liquefaction approaches, respectively. An overview of the progress in the field of plasma-based DRM is given below, starting again with DBD, MW and GA plasmas. However, in contrast to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, a vast amount of research has been performed with some other discharges as well for DRM, so these have been given their separate sections below.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">First some general trends applicable for all discharges are summarized. We start off with the SEI, because for all discharges studied, it is clear that for DRM – just like for pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting – the SEI is the major determining factor for the conversion and energy cost, as it combines the effects of power and residence time. Typically, a higher SEI leads to a higher conversion, but also incurs a higher energy cost.

        <p class="otherpara">Besides the SEI (or the power and gas flow rate), the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixing ratio has a tremendous influence on the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions, as well as on the product selectivities. In general, when adding more CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> to the mixture, the effective CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversion rises, while the effective CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion drops. Note that we talk about the effective conversions (as defined in Section 4.4.2; <a title="" href="#eqn13">eqn (4)</a>) and not about the (absolute) conversion itself, in order to take the effect of the change in gas mixture into account. At the same time, the selectivity towards (light) hydrocarbons increases, as well as the selectivity towards H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, while the CO selectivity decreases, when more CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> is present in the mixture.

        <p class="otherpara">These trends can be explained by the following reactions: increasing the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratio leads to a more pronounced H<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation and at the same time it reduces the amount of O species in the mixture. Hence, the reaction C + O → CO is reduced, leading to a lower CO selectivity, and increased carbon deposition. On the other hand, the reaction H<small><sub>2</sub></small> + O → H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O becomes more important, giving rise to the higher H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O production, but it is not significant enough to balance the higher H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production, thus explaining the increased H<small><sub>2</sub></small> selectivity. This also means that the deposited C is still an active species in the reactions, and it is suggested that the addition of O<small><sub>2</sub></small><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit207"><sup><span class="sup_ref">207</span></sup></a> and/or H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit217"><sup><span class="sup_ref">217</span></sup></a> can prevent carbon deposition. Finally, it is reported that the rate of CO production is always higher than the rate of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction, proving that CO is formed by both the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the oxidation of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a></p>

For the other plasma types, no specific data have yet been reported in the literature on the effect of the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixing ratio on the total conversion. Finally, as the energy cost is inversely proportional to the obtained conversion (<span class="italic">cf.</span> Section 4.4.3; <a title="" href="#eqn16">eqn (7)</a>), the effect of the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixing ratio on the energy cost is opposite to the effects described above for the total conversion.</p>

          <span>Due to its simple design and ease of use – also in combination with packing materials – again most of the research to date has been performed with DBDs, with the coaxial reactor (see Section 4.2.1; <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig13">Fig. 13</a>) being the main geometry. To improve the conversion and energy costs, and to tune the product distribution, several approaches have been investigated, including changing the SEI, applying pulsed power, changing the gas flow rate or feed ratio, changing the reaction temperature or pressure, applying multi-electrode configurations or different electrode materials, and mixing with other gases, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> Ar, He, N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, as well as introducing (catalytic) packing materials. Some of these effects have already been described above, but the others are explained in more detail below. Furthermore, extensive modelling work has also been performed to obtain more fundamental insights into the plasma chemistry and in turn to aid in the improvement of future experiments. For all the experiments reported in the literature, the syngas components H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO were the major reaction products, with smaller amounts of C<small><sub>2</sub></small> and C<small><sub>3</sub></small> hydrocarbons also detected, in the order: C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small> ⋙ C<small><sub>3</sub></small>H<small><sub>8</sub></small> &gt; C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small> &gt; C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>. In even lower quantities, hydrocarbons up to C<small><sub>5</sub></small> have been detected, where the selectivities of unsaturated hydrocarbons are again much lower than those of paraffins. The major products detected when the condensate was analysed<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183,222,225,226</span></sup></a> were C<small><sub>4</sub></small>–C<small><sub>10</sub></small> hydrocarbons and oxygenates, including methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, acetic acid and other <span class="italic">e.g.</span> tertiary alcohols, ketones, esters and carboxylic acids.</span>

When plotting the energy cost as a function of the conversion, it is clear that most of the results are situated above an energy cost of 20 eV per molecule and below a conversion of 60%, albeit with some exceptions.

Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit106"><sup><span class="sup_ref">106</span></sup></a> indicated that, although the conversion increases when adding Ar, the latter is not sufficient to counteract the lower CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> feed content, since the conversion rates are lower compared to a mixture without Ar.

          <p class="otherpara">Due to the historical interest in thermocatalytic DRM and the ease of implementing a (catalytic) packing in the discharge zone of a DBD, as explained in Section 4.3, a lot of research has already been performed towards plasma-catalytic DRM and hybrid reactors.

          <p class="otherpara">Some key findings of these models are presented here. Snoeckx <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181</span></sup></a> performed an extensive modelling study, with detailed plasma chemistry, spanning a wide range of experimentally accessible conditions. The model predicted that increasing the SEI at a constant gas ratio and frequency results in a higher total conversion. However, the increase in conversion is not entirely proportional to the rise in SEI, resulting in somewhat higher energy costs with increasing the SEI. The lowest energy cost was predicted to be 16.9 eV per molecule, but this corresponds to a very low value for the total conversion, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 0.015%. On the other hand, the highest total conversion predicted by the model, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 84.2%, corresponded to an energy cost of 30.1 eV per molecule. A larger amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was observed to lead to a higher total conversion and lower energy cost. This is attributed to the O atoms formed by the electron-impact dissociation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which reacts very effectively with the H atoms originating from the electron-impact dissociation of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>. As shown in the kinetics analysis of Snoeckx <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit254"><sup><span class="sup_ref">254</span></sup></a> the conversion of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> is normally limited by the fast backward reaction, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> CH<small><sub>3</sub></small> + H → CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, but when more O atoms are available, this reaction is of minor importance compared to the reaction O + H/OH → OH/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. Thus, by limiting the backward reaction, the conversion of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> rises dramatically with increasing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> content, leading to a higher total conversion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181</span></sup></a> Another important effect is the total number of micro-discharge filaments that the gas molecules experience when passing through the DBD reactor. It seems that for most cases a larger number of filaments, but with lower energy, yields higher values for the conversion and lower energy costs, compared to a smaller number of filaments, but with more energy deposited per filament.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181</span></sup></a> In some other models by Janeco <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> and Goujard <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> the effect of adding He to the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixture was investigated. Both groups reported that He, as well as all other species that may result from the electron collisions in the gas mixture, can significantly change the electron velocity distribution function, the electron reaction rates and the energy losses, which can ultimately affect the energy cost when taken into account in the model.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Summarizing all the data in the literature, we can conclude that a DBD reactor can provide reasonable conversions of up to 60% and 80% for empty (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> non-packed) and packed-bed DBDs, respectively. However, the energy cost lies in the range of 20–100 eV per molecule, which corresponds to an energy efficiency of 12.8–2.6%, assuming that only syngas is formed. This is at least a factor 5 away from the necessary 4.27 eV per molecule benchmark for the energy cost (or the 60% benchmark for energy efficiency), as defined at the beginning of this section, with no positive outlook on the horizon. Indeed, even extensive modelling studies have predicted that the lowest achievable energy cost, obtained after careful selection of the operating conditions, would be 16.9 eV per molecule (see above).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181</span></sup></a> Hence, despite a simple reactor design for scalability, the ease of implementing a wide variety of packings and its industrial success for ozone generation (and possibly VOC abatement), at this point, the high energy cost – and hence low energy efficiency – makes it doubtful that DBDs will be the most suitable technology for DRM into syngas. Nevertheless, due to its ease of use, research with DBDs still can yield valuable insights and knowledge, which may be transferable to other more efficient discharges. On the other hand, if suitable catalysts could be found for the production of valuable oxygenates with high yields through direct (plasma-catalytic) oxidative liquefaction,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> the energy efficiency target would be significantly lower (by a factor of 2–3 in the case of methanol), so this could change the analysis drastically. However, many challenges for this pathway remain, such as finding suitable catalysts, and advances in energy efficiency are also still required.</p>

          <span>It is clear that DRM has already been explored more extensively than pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, and several promising results have already been obtained for various types of plasmas. On the other hand, the DRM process is clearly more complex than pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting. The CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratio plays an extremely important role, not only in the conversion rates and energy cost, but even more importantly in the product distributions and syngas ratio. A balance appears to be required, since at high CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratios carbon deposition can cause detrimental effects, while at low ratios the H atoms are lost to H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, and next to H<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation. Several discharges also exhibit high selectivities towards syngas, which is beneficial for the indirect oxidative pathway, while others might be more interesting in the long run due to their suitability for a direct oxidative pathway, in combination with catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a></span>

          <p class="otherpara">First of all, it is clear that for DRM – just like for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting – although DBDs are by far the most extensively studied, they do not allow the energy-efficient conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> into syngas. Their energy cost currently remains a factor of 5 too high, even when combined with a packing, and we do not expect this to be sufficiently improved in the near future for them to become industrially competitive. On the other hand, if suitable catalysts could be found that would allow the direct high yield production of valuable oxygenates, this would change the analysis drastically, due to the more favourable energy requirements for the one-step process, as explained above. The same conclusion applies to most studies on corona discharges and the several studies on APGDs, with some exceptions as mentioned below.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Second, there is a significant lack of data with MW plasmas on DRM compared to pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Research in this area is highly recommended to evaluate whether the potential of MW discharges for DRM is as high as for pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Third, the best results for GA plasmas are easily capable of surpassing the energy efficiency (or energy cost) target set for DRM. Even for conversions up to 40%, the energy efficiency target is easily crossed and they clearly operate in a strong non-equilibrium regime, as evidenced when compared to the thermal equilibrium limit. Moreover, further improvements can still be expected from this discharge type, as the full capabilities of the novel type of GAP, which has many advantages compared to classical GA discharges (see Sections 4.2.3 and 5.1.3 above), have not yet been explored for DRM.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Fourth, although the use of spark discharges and nanosecond pulsed discharges is relatively new and studies are still scarce, energy costs in the range of 10 eV per molecule are reported, and even as low as 3 eV per molecule, thus already reaching the efficiency target, even with the limited amount of research performed to date. For the nanosecond pulsed discharges, conversions are currently limited to 40–50% at these energy costs, while for spark discharges, conversions up to 85–95% have already been achieved. This clearly shows the potential for this type of discharge, and more research should be performed to further exploit their possibilities.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Finally, as mentioned above, for APGDs, some results obtained in the literature seem to be very promising. Indeed, as appears from <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig32">Fig. 32</a>, the best overall results were clearly achieved for APGDs, which could reach a high conversion, such as 88% for the spark discharge, in combination with low energy costs, such as 1.2 eV per molecule for the GA discharges. Thus, at this stage, APGDs together with GA discharges seem to be the most powerful, providing significant conversions at high energy efficiencies for DRM.</p>

For the measurements without a catalyst, a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion of 12–25% was obtained, depending on the SEI. The higher the power or the longer the residence time, the higher the conversion was. The reported selectivities were 18–14% for H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and 97–99% for CO, leading to a syngas ratio of 0.55–0.18.

CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and water vapour were used as the feed gases, with varying the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O content in the mixture between 0% and 8% for three different SEI values. It was demonstrated that adding a few % of water to a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> plasma leads to a steep drop in the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, and then both the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O conversion keep on decreasing slightly when adding more water.

The combination of the experiments with a computational chemical kinetics study allowed the researchers to analyse the chemical kinetics and to construct and investigate the different chemical pathways to clarify the experimental results. In general, it was concluded that for a DBD, the main reactive species created are OH, CO, O and H, of which the OH radicals will quickly recombine with CO into CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, thereby limiting the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion upon the addition of water.

One of the suggested reasons for this was the increased instability of the GA with the increasing water vapour concentration. Nunnally <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> investigated the effect of adding 1% water vapour for a GAP, and showed an increase in the energy cost from 9.5 to 14.8 eV per molecule.

          <span>In general, from all the data presented in the available literature, we may conclude that, for plasma-only cases, the addition of even small amounts of water (1–2%) leads to a significantly lower CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion. This declining trend continues upon the addition of even more water, albeit less severe. As a result, the addition of water also leads to higher energy costs. For a classical DBD reactor, the energy cost is already quite limited, thus making it unsuitable for the combined CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O conversion. As shown in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 above, MW and GA plasmas are far more efficient. Moreover, they operate at somewhat higher temperatures, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> in the order of 1000 K or more, which enables the addition of more H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O vapour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O might quench the vibrational levels of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100,162</span></sup></a> thus reducing the most energy-efficient conversion process, and therefore raising the energy cost. Both GA studies reported in the literature, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> those by Nunnally <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> and Indarto <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> seem to confirm this hypothesis, while the MW results from Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit285"><sup><span class="sup_ref">285</span></sup></a> seem to contradict it. However, the MW set-up of Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span> might be less prone to this quenching mechanism, since it operates at low pressures (30–60 Torr). Furthermore, the presence of water in the low pressure MW case also seems to lead to a cooling effect, resulting in a higher energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the low pressure operation is still less ideal for industrial implementation. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig33">Fig. 33</a> summarizes the energy cost per converted CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecule as a function of the conversion, for those discharges where data were available.</span>

Although research on this process is more limited than for DRM – and hence the road ahead is longer – this clearly indicates that, just like for DRM above, the plasmachemical conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O as a co-reactant allows for the development of the highly desirable direct oxidative pathway.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">It is clear from the results obtained in the literature that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O seem to be unsuitable to create oxygenated hydrocarbons in a one-step process by means of a pure non-thermal plasma, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> in the absence of a catalyst, with the exception of the negative DC corona discharge. There are too many steps involved in generating these oxygenates, such as CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH, in an efficient way, and all of them involve H atoms, which will have the tendency to quickly recombine with OH into H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O or with O<small><sub>2</sub></small> into HO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which also reacts further with O into OH, and hence H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. The problem at hand is thus that the interactions of H atoms with oxygen species (either OH, O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> or O atoms) are too fast and their tendency to form H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is too strong.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O plasmas can deliver an easily controllable H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio with a rich hydrogen content – even up to 8.6 – when sufficient amounts of water can be added to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> plasma, as was demonstrated in the computational study by Snoeckx <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit280"><sup><span class="sup_ref">280</span></sup></a> Hence, they might be suitable to create value-added chemicals, such as oxygenates, in a two-step process, which is good news. However, the interaction between H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissociation products, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the recombination between OH and CO into CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and the recombination of H and OH into H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, limit the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O conversion, and thus the formation of useful products. Besides syngas, the direct production of sufficient amounts of hydrogen peroxide, which can be used as a disinfectant or for biomedical purposes, seems possible. However, the formation rate of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> is also partially limited by the destruction reaction of OH + H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> towards H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and HO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Therefore, rapid removal of the formed product (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>), <span class="italic">e.g.</span> by means of a membrane, would be an important aspect for further improving this process. Based on these findings, and the work by Mahammadunnisa <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit281"><sup><span class="sup_ref">281</span></sup></a> it is evident that a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O plasma should be combined with a catalyst in order to produce value-added chemicals.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102,107</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">As such, it appears that, due to the inherent nature of this mixture and the plasma set-ups, the future for the combined CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O conversion by pure plasma technology does not look so bright at the moment. Nevertheless, we believe that a possible promising way forward is by its combination with specific tailored catalysts to produce value-added chemicals.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Such catalysts should be able to selectively let the plasma-generated CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> react into oxygenates, such as methanol, and subsequently allow separation of the methanol from the mixture. As mentioned in the next section, Eliasson <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit288"><sup><span class="sup_ref">288</span></sup></a> applied a CuO/ZnO/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> catalyst in a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> discharge, which resulted in an increase in methanol yield and selectivity by more than a factor of 10.

          <p class="otherpara">Based on the chemical kinetics pathway analysis presented by Snoeckx <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit280"><sup><span class="sup_ref">280</span></sup></a> (see Section 5.3.1 above), two pathways might be interesting and realistic to achieve: (i) promoting the recombination of OH radicals to H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> or (ii) promoting the reduction of CO to methanol. In both cases, the thermodynamic aspects at the nanoscale will become very important, especially since plasma-catalysis is a far-from-equilibrium process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit107"><sup><span class="sup_ref">107</span></sup></a> The critical point will be the arrival and binding (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> physi- or chemisorption) of the reactants to the catalyst surface. To be successful, this process should be faster than the recombination rate of OH with H into H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. Of course, these suggestions are only speculations, and further research will be needed to investigate these possibilities in practice.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">We need to give a final critical note concerning safety. We need to be cautious about the explosive mixture that can be formed during this process – which could of course also occur for some of the other novel technologies discussed in Section 3, when O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> are not produced separately – due to the presence of O<small><sub>2</sub></small>, together with CO, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and an ignition source in a plasma set-up. At the research level, this will probably never be a problem due to the low volumes and conversions. However, when going to a pilot or industrial scale, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> with larger volumes and conversions, the risk will increase significantly. Consequently, both the capital and operating costs will increase drastically to ensure safe operations. One way to circumvent this problem is by diluting this mixture with an inert gas, such as argon or helium. In this case, however, an additional separation (for the products) and recuperation (for the inert gas) step will need to be included, which will also increase the cost. Furthermore, part of the input energy will be lost due to the electron-impact excitation and ionization of these gases. Therefore, this option will reduce the energy efficiency and increase the operating cost, but it will ensure safe operation.</p>

Furthermore, by optimizing the system to use low power and high pressure, it became possible to further enhance the methanol selectivity over the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> selectivity. The results indicate that the discharge shifts the region of maximum catalyst activity from 220 °C to 100 °C.

For the conventional catalytic hydrogenation case, a conversion of 96% was observed at 360 °C, while for the plasma-assisted hydrogenation, the same conversion was already reached at 260 °C. It was assumed that the reactive species generated in the plasma reactor could speed up the rate determining step of the catalytic hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> involves the dissociation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to CO and O on the active site of the Ni/zeolite (CO<small><sub>2,ads</sub></small> → CO<small><sub>ads</sub></small> + O<small><sub>ads</sub></small>).

Subsequently, the dissociated species react with hydrogen to produce CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>. This increased methanation rate is believed to arise from an increase in the surface concentration of carbon. The plasma can help to dissociate the adsorbed molecules, and hence surface carbon can be produced by both thermal activation and plasma activation, ultimately resulting in a higher methanation rate. Without Ni (bare zeolite), the conversion of CO and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was found to be less than 1%, implying that the zeolite support together with the plasma cannot efficiently convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit289"><sup><span class="sup_ref">289</span></sup></a></p>

The latter clearly indicates that it is indeed the plasma that initiates the methanation process by dissociating adsorbed CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecules – a reaction that does not take place catalytically below 250 °C.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Recently, Zeng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit291"><sup><span class="sup_ref">291</span></sup></a> investigated the performance of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation in a DBD at atmospheric pressure and low temperature, both with and without a catalyst, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> Cu/γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, Mn/γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and Cu-Mn/γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>. Some plasma-only results were also presented. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was found to be 7.5%, and the main products were CO, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>. The CO and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> selectivity were 46% and 8%, respectively. No methanol production was reported, although this might have been due to the inability to detect this compound by the GC set-up used. Adding the catalysts enhanced the process: the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion increased to 8–10%, while the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> selectivity remained around 6.9–8.6%, but the CO selectivity and yield were enhanced to 76–80% and 6.4–7.9%, respectively.</p>

The most abundant products predicted by the model were CO, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, and to a lower extent also formaldehyde, C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small>, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and methanol. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was found to be rather low (2–7% in all the gas mixing ratios), especially when compared to typical values found for DRM (3–20%) at comparable conditions. This was thought to be the result of the lack of high enough concentrations of CH<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>3</sub></small> radicals, which aid in the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion. Moreover, a very similar chemical behaviour as described above for the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O mixture<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit280"><sup><span class="sup_ref">280</span></sup></a> was reported. Indeed, the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was limited due to the formation of CHO (CO + H + M → CHO + M), which reacted back to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (CHO + O → CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> + H). Furthermore, a lot of subsequent reactions were needed to form the desired hydrocarbons or oxygenates, such as CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and methanol, making their overall production rates negligible. Hence, it was concluded that a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixture in a DBD-only set-up is not suitable for the production of value-added chemicals.</p>

        <span>A first comparison is made based on the versatility of the different CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion technologies. <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a> shows the different technologies and the four different CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion approaches that were discussed. Traditional thermal catalysis, as discussed in Section 2, can be successfully applied for DRM and the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, but seems unsuccessful at this point for pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, while data for the combined conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O are unavailable. The novel technologies, discussed in Section 3, are all applicable to converting CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> together with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. Furthermore, the electrochemical and solar-thermochemical-based technologies are also capable of pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting. The combinations with CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> are not generally reported in the literature. Plasmachemical conversion, on the other hand, currently is the only technology reporting successful application for all four processes, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, DRM, the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the combined conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. As discussed in detail in Section 5, plasma-based pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting and DRM are obviously the two most successful processes today, with some types of plasmas already surpassing the posed 60% energy efficiency target for syngas production and achieving conversions of up to 90–95%, even without the combination with catalysis. Furthermore, the production of liquids in a one-step process, through a direct oxidative pathway (in combination with catalysts), has already proven successful, with further research in full progress. In this case, avoiding the intermediate syngas step, and thus circumventing the need for an additional Fischer–Tropsch or methanol synthesis and subsequently the methanol/ethanol to olefins synthesis, would significantly reduce the energy efficiency target and make it more competitive (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> by at least a factor of 2–3 in the case of methanol). Studies regarding the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> using plasmas in combination with catalysis are very promising as well, but more research is still required. Although technically possible, the combined conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O – the so-called artificial photosynthesis – with plasma technology seems the least promising from the data available to date. Nonetheless, here as well the combination with catalysis could prove beneficial, if a suitable catalyst could be found, as discussed in Section 5.3.5 above, but to date, research in this area is very scarce.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">From an economical and sustainable point of view, the use of rare earth metals is one of the key disadvantages of most technologies at this point, except for biochemical and plasmachemical conversion. As mentioned before, the grand challenge for the other emerging technologies to be successful (as well as for traditional catalysis) is switching to inexpensive earth-abundant metals. It cannot be stressed enough that this is a critical make or break point, but which is not an issue for the plasmachemical conversion.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The discussion regarding the reliance on renewable energy in a direct or indirect manner (see Sections 1, 3 and 4) is more nuanced. The ability of solar thermochemical, photochemical and biochemical conversion to directly utilize renewable energy, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> solar radiation, can be considered to give them an edge over the other novel technologies, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, catalysis by MW-heating, electrochemical and plasmachemical conversion, which rely on electricity, and hence indirect renewable energy. The former have the advantage of skipping an energy conversion step, which would otherwise always leads to further energy losses, hence the energy efficiency of the latter is intrinsically determined by the efficiency of the renewable electricity generation. On the other hand, this also means that the MW-heating, electrochemical and plasmachemical processes can rely on other renewable energy sources as well, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> wind, hydro, wave and tidal power, increasing their versatility and employability, since they can be installed and operated independent of the availability of solar light. This significantly increases the application flexibility of MW-heating and electrochemical as well as plasmachemical conversion. Note that bio- and photochemical technologies may also rely on indirect renewable energy, when used in combination with artificial lighting.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The wide-scale adoption of these renewable energy sources, and their intermittent character, poses a challenge for the efficient storage and easy transport of the electricity produced. Not only is there a need for peak shaving, but more importantly a need for grid stabilization, which requires technologies to follow the irregular and at times intermittent supply of renewable electricity in a flexible manner. Technologies that are able to harness this energy and convert it into carbon neutral fuels could play an important role for the future energy infrastructure industry. Due to the intermittent character of renewable energies, a flexible storage process, which can easily be switched on and off to follow the supply, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> a so-called turnkey process, would be most ideal. Photochemical and plasmachemical conversion are the only two processes that truly meet this condition. They can be turned on with the flick of a switch, since no pre-heating or long stabilization times (&lt;30 minutes) are required, as is the case for traditional catalysis. Likewise, they can be turned off with the flick of a switch, since no sensitive cool-down times are required and there is no risk of damaging the reactors with repeated on–off cycles. The problem with electrochemical cells is that, not only do they operate at elevated temperatures, but they are not designed– indeed, they suffer – for repeatedly being turned on and off, while biochemical processes need to be looked after on a continuous basis, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> regarding the nutrients, light, temperature, mixing.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">From an industrial point of view, high conversions and yields are required, and most technologies are already capable of delivering on these requirements, with the exception of the photo- and biochemical conversion. A closely related key parameter is the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, which is discussed separately in the next section (Section 6.3).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, when assuming that all or most of the feed is converted, the question arises as to whether an additional post-reaction separation step is required for the products. Solar thermochemical and electrochemical conversion (depending on the process and cell type) are the only two technologies capable of generating separated product streams, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> separated CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> streams in the case of pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting. This is an important advantage, since the separation of CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> is rather energy intensive at this point, although in the future, membranes might bring a convenient solution to this problem. Currently, this is probably the major disadvantage of plasma technology, as the products are all in one feed, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> for pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, a mixture of CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> is produced, and for DRM a mixture of (mainly) CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, with – highly depending on the discharge type – some (minor) side-products, like hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Of course, a mixture of CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> should not be a big problem, if the mixture will be immediately processed further through Fischer–Tropsch or methanol synthesis, since the plasmachemical conversion is able to deliver any desired syngas ratio, mainly depending on the gas mixing ratio in the feed. Nevertheless, research on the <span class="italic">in situ</span> trapping of species<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> or a combination with other technologies<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297</span></sup></a> is highly valuable, and requires more attention.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">At the same time, this problem can also become less significant when focusing on the direct conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into value-added liquid oxygenated products by means of plasma-catalysis,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102,103</span></sup></a> including alcohols, aldehydes and acids, which are easier to separate. In the long run, as already mentioned before, this direct oxidative pathway to produce more value-added products is highly preferred rather than the current indirect method, which involves first producing CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which are then further processed. At the moment, except for solar thermochemical conversion, all the technologies are already able to produce more value-added chemicals in a direct fashion, although the yields are still extremely low and most research is still in its early stages.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The investment and operating costs are in general considered to be low for most technologies. The main exceptions are solar thermochemical conversion, which has a high investment cost for concentrating the solar energy, and biochemical conversion, where both investment and operating costs can be high, depending on the bioreactor type. Furthermore, the plasmachemical conversion is a highly modular technology, which is not dependent on an economy of scale and thus allows for local on-demand production capabilities.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally, one of the key-features for CCU techniques is their overall flexibility. This is actually a combination of many of the features discussed above. The plasmachemical conversion has a tremendous advantage here, due to its feed flexibility (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), its energy source flexibility (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear power), its operation flexibility (instant on/off, power scalability) and its flexibility of scale. None of the other technologies possess this unique combination of features required for successful worldwide implementation as a CCU technique.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In conclusion, plasma technology fares very well in this comparison, with its main disadvantages being: (i) its current need for post-reaction separation processes, (ii) the fact that the energy efficiency is dependent on the reactor type and (iii) the need for combination with catalysis to steer the product yield and selectivity.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect3528"><span class="b_heading">6.3. Solar-to-fuel efficiency</span></h3>
        <span>In our opinion, the most interesting measure to compare the different technologies is based on how well solar energy is converted into chemical energy, known as the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency (<span class="italic">η</span><small><sub>solar-to-fuel</sub></small>). First, we calculate this value for the various plasma-based technologies, based on the data presented above. Subsequently, we compare these solar-to-fuel efficiencies with the values for the other emerging technologies.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Where possible (see the discussion in Section 6.4 below), we calculated the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency for all the pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting data, based upon:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn18"/><a href="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t11_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c6cs00066e-t11.tif" src="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t11.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(9)</td></tr></table>where Δ<span class="italic">H</span><small><sub>c,fuel</sub></small> is the standard enthalpy of combustion of the fuel, based on the high heating value (HHV) of all the products – so basically this is the energy output. Furthermore, the SEI is the specific energy input based on the plasma power, which is thus the energy input. Finally, <span class="italic">η</span><small><sub>PV</sub></small> is the photovoltaic efficiency for electricity production, which we need to be able to compare the technologies relying on direct and indirect solar energy. Of course, as discussed in Section 6.2 above, one of the key benefits of plasma technology is its energy source flexibility. Hence, when (renewable) electricity from other sources is used, this term can be removed from the equation (just like for the electrochemical conversion). As mentioned above, it is added here to allow an easy comparison of all the different novel technologies. However, in the overall comparison, it is important to keep this note in mind.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">For the simple case of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, this means Δ<span class="italic">H</span><small><sub>c,fuel</sub></small> equals:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn19"/><a href="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t12_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c6cs00066e-t12.tif" src="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t12.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(10)</td></tr></table>where <span class="italic">χ</span> stands for the conversion, <span class="italic">S</span> and <span class="italic">Y</span> are the selectivity and yield, respectively, which are here expressed with respect to C (for CO) and to O (for O<small><sub>2</sub></small>), and <span class="italic">ṅ</span> stands for the molar flow rate.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Thus, since the C-based selectivity for CO in the case of pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting in most cases is 100%, the equation for the solar-to-fuel efficiency equals here the definition for energy efficiency (<a title="" href="#eqn15">eqn (6)</a>; defined in Section 4.4.3) – as well as the thermal energy efficiency (based on the HHV) – multiplied by the photovoltaic efficiency:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn20"/><a href="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t13_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c6cs00066e-t13.tif" src="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t13.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(11)</td></tr></table></p>
        <p class="otherpara">For the DRM data, the equation becomes a bit more delicate. First of all we need to take the HHV of the converted CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> in the feed into account as part of the denominator, since this counts as an energy input.<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn21"/><a href="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t14_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c6cs00066e-t14.tif" src="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00066e/c6cs00066e-t14.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(12)</td></tr></table></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Second, as mentioned in the sections above, a wide variety of products is formed, which all need to be taken into account. Hence, for DRM, the solar-to-fuel efficiency would only equal the definition for energy efficiency (<a title="" href="#eqn15">eqn (6)</a>) multiplied by the photovoltaic efficiency, when the stoichiometric reaction as defined in Section 2.2.1 occurs, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> + CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> → 2CO + 2H<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Note that since the SEI is based on the plasma power, this efficiency does not take the energy losses into account, which occur at the level of the power supply and power coupling with the plasma. The data regarding these energy losses are generally not reported, since those may vary greatly, depending on the plasma type and power supply used, but they are independent from the plasma process under study. Furthermore, a lot of (successful) research progress is still being made in minimizing these electrical losses when going from outlet power to plasma power.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">It should be noted that the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency could only be calculated based upon the available data in the literature. If certain reaction products were not measured, their contribution to the enthalpy of combustion could not be taken into account. Due to the scarcity of information regarding CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixtures, we only consider CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting and DRM in the following analysis.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">For the following discussions, we consider a PV efficiency value of 25% based on the efficiencies of the current commercial PV systems at the cell level.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> It is important to keep in mind that advancements in PV efficiency have a direct positive influence on the solar-to-fuel efficiency of plasma technology. For example, PV efficiencies of up to 45% have already been reported on a lab scale,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> a value which would almost double the solar-to-fuel efficiency of plasma technology as reported below.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">It is reported in the literature that – on a purely economic basis – for the various novel technologies to be cost competitive with existing chemical and fuel processes, a solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of 20% is likely to be needed for the production of syngas.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65,110</span></sup></a> Nonetheless, as already indicated above, all of these emerging technologies have additional advantages compared to the traditional catalytic technologies currently used. Furthermore, when the intermediate syngas step can be circumvented, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> due to the production of liquids through a direct oxidative pathway, this solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency target decreases drastically, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> for methanol, a solar-to-methanol efficiency of 7.1% would already be considered feasible.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> This is the greatest advantage of the plasmachemical conversion (in combination with catalysis), namely its already proven capability of producing a wide variety of liquid chemicals in a direct (although currently unselective) manner.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a> presents the best data obtained from the literature on solar-to-fuel efficiencies, together with the obtained conversions, for the different plasma types discussed in Section 5. It should be no surprise that the plasma set-ups that showed the best performance also have the highest solar-to-fuel efficiency. For pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, MW and GA plasmas are the two most promising discharge types, with maximum achieved solar-to-fuel efficiencies to date of 22.5% and 16.4%, respectively. For DRM, APGDs and GA plasmas have obtained the highest solar-to-fuel efficiencies up to now of 23.0% and 22.1%, respectively. However, most other discharges, except for DBDs, already reach efficiencies between 11% and 15%. This means that the chemicals and fuels produced by the plasmachemical conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into syngas could already be cost competitive, depending on the critical notes made above on product separation costs and power supply efficiencies.</p>

Furthermore, the theoretical maximum energy efficiency is 90–95%, when multiplied by the power supply efficiency and the PV efficiency. This is based on the theoretical – and experimentally proven – most energy-efficient CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissociation process through vibrational excitation (see Section 4.1.4). Hence, the construction, use and matching of efficient power supplies for generating the plasma is highly critical. Nonetheless, we should not forget the critical notes made above on product separation. Additional – and indeed substantial – research is needed to provide an answer to these issues, just like in the case with all the other emerging technologies and their specific concerns. Due to its emerging character, interdisciplinary research towards plasma technology, especially in combination with other fields, such as catalysis will, undoubtedly, lead to further advancement and breakthroughs in this field.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect3714"><span class="b_heading">6.4. Research recommendations</span></h3>
        <span>To conclude, we would like to provide some research recommendations for plasma technology, based on all the collected data from the literature, to further advance the field of plasma-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion. The first recommendation is related to the need for a more standardized framework in reporting data, to allow easier comparison of data within and outside the field of plasma technology. The most important criterion here is to be able to compare the conversions and energy cost/efficiency. Regarding the conversions, this requires a clear reporting on the presence of diluting agents (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, He, Ar) when used, since these agents can significantly influence the plasma process, as discussed in Section 5. Furthermore, Pinhão <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> elaborately described the effect of gas expansion during plasma processing, which is to date often neglected, but which can have a tremendous influence on data accuracy, for example on the conversions obtained through GC measurements.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92,95,125</span></sup></a> Concerning the energy cost/efficiency, first of all there should be no room for interpretation about whether the reported power is the applied input power or the measured plasma power and through which electrical techniques, such as Lissajous plots, this power was obtained. Second, one should aim to identify all the important products and their selectivities, to be able to determine the energy efficiency based on the enthalpy of the reaction, as well as the so-called fuel production efficiencies. Third, data on power supply efficiency and its optimization are urgently required to report accurate solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies. In general, as also discussed by Butterworth <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> for the testing of materials for plasma-catalysis, general frameworks on performing experiments and reporting data are becoming essential for the transparent further development of plasma research, both within the plasma community and within the larger CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion community.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally, we also have some more personal recommendations. From the plots in the sections above, showing the energy cost/efficiency as a function of the SEI, it becomes more than clear that most applied SEIs are far too high, especially for the combinations with catalysis. An SEI range of 0.1–5 eV per reactant molecule (taking possible dilutions into account) should be the target to achieve energy-efficient conversions, as also recommended by Fridman.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> Furthermore, since plasma processes are very susceptible to the effect of impurities in the feed, more research and insights are needed towards the effect of real-life gas compositions on both the physical side (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> discharge stability) and on the chemical side (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> product distributions, harmful by-products).</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect3731"><span class="a_heading">7. Conclusions and outlook</span></h2>
      <span>The conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> – preferably into value-added products – is considered one of the great challenges of our century. In the past decade, substantial progress with several novel technologies has been made. The last section of this review intended to provide the reader with a state-of-the art and critical assessment of an – up till now – rather underexposed emerging technology: the plasmachemical conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. To achieve this, we provided an introduction to the basic concepts of plasma, and we demonstrated its viability as a gas conversion technology, finally putting it in the broader context of its peers.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">From the advances in the area of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion discussed in this review, one outcome stands out without doubt. The question is not ‘if’ one of these novel technologies will be industrially competitive, but rather ‘when’ and ‘which one(s) will play the leading role’. To shine a brighter light on – the final burning question – whether plasma technology could be the answer – or at least be part of the equation – we briefly summarize here the arising opportunities and challenges for plasma technology in the field of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Plasmas possess some important advantages over certain other (novel) technologies: (i) they can operate at room temperature using any source of (renewable) electricity, (ii) they have a large flexibility in terms of the feeds that need to be processed, (iii) they provide an extremely flexible ‘turnkey’ process, which allows for the efficient storage of energy, peak shaving and grid stabilization, (iv) the reactors have low investment and operating costs, (v) they have a simple scalability both in size and applicability, and (vi) last but not least, the technology does not rely on rare earth materials – making it rather unique at this point. This unprecedented combination of features gives plasmachemical conversion a very high overall flexibility, making it an extremely useful and valuable technology for CCU.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The flip side of the coin is that the reliance of plasma technology on indirect solar energy in the form of electricity is – at the same time – a limiting factor for the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, especially compared to technologies that can directly harvest solar energy. Nonetheless, this also allows plasma technology to rely on other renewable energy sources, and more importantly, it adds to its overall – location and process – flexibility, since it is not dependent on the availability of sunlight. More urgent, however, is the issue of product separation. From all the data available in the literature, it is clear that converting CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> – with or without an additional hydrogen source – always yields a mixture of products after reaction. This implies the need for an – often expensive – post-processing separation step.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">From the benchmarking discussion, it is clear that plasma technology can definitely play an important role in the field of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, and it is not beyond our grasp to think about its eventual commercial implementation, be it on a large or small scale. Nevertheless, as always, only a few candidates seem suitable for the specific task at hand, as we outline here.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Two main CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion strategies were discussed: (i) pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting and (ii) CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion in combination with a co-reactant serving as the hydrogen source, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, yielding processes named the dry reforming of methane (DRM), the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and artificial photosynthesis, respectively. At this time, the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> through the latter two processes is – although possible – inefficient in a plasma-only set-up, not to mention industrially undesirable, due to the formation of possibly dangerous mixtures to be handled. In the future, the combination of plasma with other technologies, such as catalysis or electrolysis, could solve these issues. On the contrary, for both pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting and DRM, the proposed energy efficiency target of 60% has already been surpassed by several types of plasma reactors, resulting in a solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency for the production of syngas above – the required – 20% mark.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In the short run, pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting using the most energy-efficient set-ups, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> MW and GA discharges, appears to have a high potential. In this case, pure CO and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> could be produced, after a separation step, or a pure CO stream when <span class="italic">in situ</span> trapping of the O<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be successfully implemented, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> by combination with other technologies or through the addition of scavengers.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In the long run, it seems evident that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion in combination with a hydrogen containing co-reactant has the highest potential for the efficient production of value-added products, such as alcohols, aldehydes, esters and acids. In particular, the direct oxidative pathway, in which the intermediate syngas step is circumvented, has great potential. For now, however, a lot of research in this area is still needed to increase the selectivity towards these valuable bulk chemicals over the currently produced syngas. This will most probably need to be achieved in combination with catalysts. However, even today, APGD and GA discharges already provide an energy-efficient alternative to produce syngas in any desired ratio through DRM.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">By all means, plasma technology is not just an overlooked unicorn – although its combination of features does make it quite unique for CCU – but, as mentioned several times throughout this work, and just like for all other emerging technologies in this field, several important challenges remain. General challenges comprise the need for further fundamental research, concerning: (i) the plasmachemical processes taking place in warm discharges, such as MW and GA, which stimulate vibrational excitation; whereby the latter, representing the most energy-efficient dissociation pathway, should be further exploited by enhancing the non-equilibrium character of these plasmas to further improve the energy efficiency, (ii) the combination of plasma with catalysis and the possibility of taking advantage of the synergetic effects and the selective production of value-added compounds, (iii) <span class="italic">in situ</span> O/O<small><sub>2</sub></small> trapping by using scavengers, or combinations with other technologies, such as catalysis or SOEC, to further enhance the conversions and yields towards the desired value-added compounds, (iv) the demonstration of successful scale-up for other discharges than DBDs and (v) the production and tuning of efficient power supplies for generating and sustaining the plasma.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Moreover, some important discharge-specific research challenges can also be identified. For MW plasmas, the ultimate goal should be to achieve the same energy efficiency at atmospheric pressure as currently obtained at reduced pressure for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, while more research towards DRM is essential. For GA plasmas, the limited amount of gas that passes through the active arc region, and thus that can be converted by the plasma, is currently limiting the overall CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, and more research in this direction is needed, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> by improving the reactor design. Furthermore, some other plasma reactors show good performance, but the available data and insights are still limited, thus requiring more research to explore their full potential. Of course, inherent to every review, the above analysis represents the current state-of-the-art. Plasma-technology-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion is relatively new and it is clearly a fast advancing field with – just like for any emerging technology – ample room for improvement and new (interdisciplinary) developments.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">It appears that the ultimate plasma for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion would be a system with a high electron density (N<small><sub>e</sub></small>) and a low electron temperature (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>e</sub></small>) – resulting from a low reduced electric field (<span class="italic">E</span>/<span class="italic">n</span>) – which are essential to stimulate and achieve a high fraction of vibrational excitation. At the same time, this system should operate at a low gas temperature (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>g</sub></small>) to minimize the VT relaxation losses and backward recombination reactions. Finally, to be industrially attractive, this should be achieved at atmospheric pressure.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Future research towards the direct oxidative production of oxygenates, as well as multi-reforming processes with a combination of gases (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O or O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) or several reforming processes in series, using plasma technology appears very promising and should be pursued. Furthermore, more interdisciplinary research into the combination of plasmas with other novel technologies is highly desirable. For catalysis, the combination is already proving alluring, and it is our opinion that combinations with electrolysis, although even more challenging, could also lead to synergetic effects. As is the case for many important issues brought forward in the current age, with a high probability the future will rely on a true amalgam of technologies and solutions, each for its specific tasks, rather than the ‘one solution (or technology) fits all’ mentality of the old age.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">From the current analysis, it is evident that pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting could reach industrial implementation at a faster pace. Nevertheless, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion using a hydrogen source as a co-reactant should certainly be further pursued, since – when successful – in the long run it offers us the possibility of producing a wide variety of value-added chemicals and fuels, starting from the same building block and allowing the flexibility to tune the output depending on the market's needs. On that account, we believe plasmas could be – at least part of – the bright light that shines on our horizon.</p>
