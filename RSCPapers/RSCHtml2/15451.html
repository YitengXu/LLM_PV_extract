        <span class="bold">Nada Benhaddou</span> opened the discussion of the paper by Jiang Tang: You have performed the annealing in an unsealed graphite box. I am wondering if there is a reason behind this choice. Have you ever tried with a sealed one and noticed a difference between the two systems?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jiang Tang</span> answered: Thanks for your question. We use an unsealed graphite box for the annealing of Se films because we want to achieve rapid cooling to reduce the sublimation of Se atoms during annealing. The open system may be more conducive to rapid cooling of the Se films. We also agree that a sealed system can reduce the degradation of Se films during annealing to some extent, but we haven’t conducted a comparative test of annealing with different graphite boxes. Thank you for your suggestion. We will try to anneal our Se films with a sealed graphite box later.</p>

        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> remarked: It is nice to see a historic system, such as Se, being revisited for photovoltaics. I am curious that the older literature refers to Se as an indirect band gap material, while you refer to it as being a direct band gap material. Do you know which is the case?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jiang Tang</span> answered: Thank you very much for your question. According to previous studies, trigonal selenium is considered to be a direct band gap semiconductor at room temperature.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small> A direct band gap semiconductor does not need phonons to participate in the photoelectric conversion, and its power conversion efficiency is usually higher than that of an indirect band gap semiconductor, which is also the advantage of trigonal selenium as a photovoltaic material.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan D. Major</span> asked: Prior work on selenium solar cells used a tellurium wetting layer in order to achieve the correct morphology after annealing.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Have you had to use that for your process or is the selenium deposited directly onto the zinc oxide? Does the ZnO play a role in achieving good coverage?</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jiang Tang</span> replied: Thanks for your question. Compared with the previous work, our Se film is directly deposited on the ZnO layer. We believe that the slight reaction at the Se/ZnO interface during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) can release the stress at the interface and improve the coverage of the Se film (Fig. S2 in the ESI of our paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00070A">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00070a</a>). We also tried to prepare Se films on other n-type materials (like CdS and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>), but due to a lack of stress relief at the interface, the Se films would detach from the substrate and pinholes would form in the film due to excessive stress in the annealing process. So we think the ZnO layer plays a role in achieving good coverage of the Se film.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> queried: You mentioned that Si can be used as a bottom solar cell with a Se-based solar cell on top. Have you tried growing Se films on Si wafers and, if so, how successful was it?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jiang Tang</span> replied: Thanks for your question. We have not yet integrated our Se cell with silicon cells or fabricated Se films on Si wafers. However, we plan to prepare our further-optimized Se solar cell on a Si bottom cell in the future.</p>

        <span class="bold">David J. Fermin</span> commented: It is unusual to see crystal reorientation in a thin film promoted by a fast thermal treatment instead of a slow annealing step. Could you elaborate on the mechanism and factors behind this observation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jiang Tang</span> answered: Thanks for your question. In fact, we believe that the rate of crystal reorientation is closely related to the temperature of the treatment. Under a certain temperature, the atoms gain enough energy to break the bonds and be rearranged, leading to crystal reorientation. Furthermore, under higher temperatures, the thermal motion of the atoms is more intense, and the crystal reorientation is faster. So, as long as the temperature is high enough, we can achieve crystal reorientation through rapid thermal annealing. Actually, rapid thermal annealing is a common method for promoting the crystallization of chalcogenide photovoltaics with high saturated vapor pressure, such as Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> and GeSe, <span class="italic">etc.</span><small><sup>1–3</sup></small></p>

Also, there is a sub-bandgap edge in the Tauc plot, which is ascribed to oxidation of selenium. If you chose to do selenization in a tube furnace with prior evacuation, followed by filling with N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, how did you expect the oxidation of Se?</p>

        <span class="bold">Jiang Tang</span> replied: Thanks for your question. We achieved rapid cooling through opening the thermal insulation cover of the RTA chamber and placing it at a lower ambient temperature (20 °C). At the end of the annealing process, the RTA chamber gets cooled at a rate of about 5 °C per second. When the temperature of the RTA chamber gets close to the ambient temperature, the cooling rate gradually decreases.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">To the other question: Thanks for your suggestion. I think using selenium powder to react with the oxygen remaining in the tube furnace is a good deoxygenation method worth trying, and will not introduce impurities.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mohit Sood</span> replied: We have recently investigated the impact of annealing Cu(In,Ga)S<small><sub>2</sub></small> absorbers coated with 1000 deposition cycles of (Zn,Sn)O in a nitrogen environment. In that study, we observed an improvement in the quasi-Fermi level splitting for 15 minute and 30 minute annealing times, and a loss in quasi-Fermi level splitting for higher annealing duration. These results suggest that annealing does play a role and might be the reason why we see a improvement in quasi-Fermi level splitting between 1000 cycles and 1200 cycles.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">Regarding the increase in CdS buffer layer thickness, I think it is very hard to speculate what will happen. Maybe with a thicker buffer layer, we might get more band bending in the absorber. This could lead to a modification in the recombination channels within the space charge region or close to the interface. However, as to what will be the impact on the quasi-Fermi level splitting, this will depend upon the nature of the non-radiative recombination centers within this region.</p>

In both the SIMS and quant mapping on the cross-section of the absorber using energy dispersive X-ray analysis, we have observed a Ga enrichment and an In deficiency towards the molybdenum contact (back side) in the sample.

        <span class="bold">Rafael Jaramillo</span> remarked: For the buffer deposited at 105 °C, the PL emission curves look to be simply down-shifted. It seems as if a PL quenching mechanism was added (or the optics changed to make extraction less likely), without changing the emitting material. As opposed to the case of the buffer deposited at 120 °C, in which case the spectrum changed, indicating a change in the emitting material and/or the location of emission within the stack.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mohit Sood</span> answered: For the buffer deposited at 120 °C, we believe the change in the spectrum comes from the Ga grading within the absorber. Our absorbers are not uniform in terms of composition and they have a slight [Ga]/[Ga + In] concentration variation. We have observed a slight shift in the PL emission peak depending on the [Ga]/[Ga + In] concentration in the absorber when measuring the same absorber at different spots. Of course, it can be that the location of the emission within the stack also changed after depositing the buffer. This is something that we are investigating now.</p>

        <span class="bold">Susanne Siebentritt</span> replied: This is not so easy to answer, because many things can happen.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">If the buffer has a wide band gap and no absorption in the spectral region of the PL spectrum, and if it is very low doped, the PL should not change with buffer thickness.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">If the buffer shows absorption in the spectral region of the PL, it would distort the spectrum and increasingly so with a thicker layer.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">If the buffer is sufficiently highly doped: with increasing buffer thickness, a space charge region in the absorber will build up. If we measure the PL with a small spot, the flux will decrease, because we are no longer at open-circuit. If we measure with a large spot, that illuminates the whole sample, so nothing should change.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another thing to keep in mind: if the buffer has a strong absorption of the excitation light, it would decrease the intensity that reaches the absorber and, thus, decrease the PL. I’m sure there are other effects that I don’t have in mind right now.</p>

We have performed qFL (intensity calibrated photoluminescence) measurements on absorbers coated with ZnMgO buffer layers using atomic layer deposition and sputtering. In the sputtered ZnMgO buffer samples, we have observed significantly lower qFLs compared to the atomic layer deposited ZnMgO buffer devices.

        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> addressed Mohit Sood: From my experience with the coating of ALD ZnSnO onto CIGSe for PEC applications, I’ve learned that there was substantial migration of In from CIGSe to ZnSnO. We saw a strong In signal by XPS, even after the deposition of ∼20 nm ZnSnO, while other elements from CIGSe were not detected (as it should be, given the thickness of the ZnSnO overlayer).

        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> presented some information on a method to screen for tunability and alloys for PV: Computational “high-throughput” materials screenings for photovoltaic (PV) materials typically search for compounds within materials databases such as the Materials Project (MP),<small><sup>1</sup></small> the ICSD,<small><sup>2</sup></small> AFLOW,<small><sup>3</sup></small> and OQMD,<small><sup>4</sup></small> among others. For example, to look for PV absorbers, a database can be queried by a series of descriptors—band gap as a proxy for absorption edge within the visible wavelength regime; effective mass as a proxy for high mobility; and other metrics such as SLME<small><sup>5</sup></small> and various “defect tolerance” metrics<small><sup>6</sup></small>—to suggest a set of candidate materials for detailed experimental inquiry. This approach has been used successfully to propose new thin film PV absorbers, such as chalcogenide perovskites (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, BaZrS<small><sub>3</sub></small> (ref. 7) and LaYS<small><sub>3</sub></small> (ref. 8)), pnictides (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, K<small><sub>3</sub></small>Cu<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> and Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>CuP (ref. 9)) mixed anions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, SbSeI (ref. 10)), among others,<small><sup>11</sup></small> as well as to propose new wide band gap carrier-selective contact or buffer materials such as BP and Ba<small><sub>2</sub></small>BiTaO<small><sub>6</sub></small>.<small><sup>12</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">However, these screening studies commonly only suggest stoichiometric, “pure” compounds, often those in which synthesis is difficult, doping is unsuccessful, or off-stoichiometry induces deviations from desired properties. In contrast, experimental progress typically starts from a well-studied, well-characterized material and, to achieve desired performance, properties are modified iteratively with the addition of dopants or alloying elements during growth. Most commercially-relevant thin film PV materials are alloyed or doped in this manner to access tunability, such as cadmium telluride (CdSe<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Te<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>), III–Vs for space applications (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, In<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ga<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>N<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>As<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>), CIGS (CuIn<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ga<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>S<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>Se<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>), and more recently the kesterite family.<small><sup>13</sup></small> Thus, conventional PV material searches may exclude promising alloys in which tunable properties diverge from properties of their parent compounds. Given this discrepancy, a high-throughput framework to look for tunability in materials could be useful to enable the PV materials discovery community to explicitly search for alloys.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In Woods-Robinson, Horton, and Persson 2022,<small><sup>14</sup></small> a framework is introduced to systematically search for tunability in materials. For the first time, we create a database of tunable materials by connecting data in existing materials databases to suggest possible solid solutions between pairs of already-known materials. The resulting “alloy database” (here, “alloy” means a structurally commensurate pair of materials that may or may not be synthesizable) is publicly accessible such that researchers can perform their own queries and can filter outputs as they see appropriate. Thus, a new materials screening procedure is now possible that can be used to suggest new functional materials that may have been entirely overlooked by previous methods biased towards endpoint compounds.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">This method is intended as a tool to assist researchers as a starting point to explore tunability within existing databases. The framework is applied to MP and ICSD data, but in principle could be applied to any database of compounds with the open-source code we have made available. It is noted that no new calculations are performed here; rather, the method provides a new perspective into data that already exists. This work then enables new research, but users should be aware of its limitations; the alloys database is only as good as its underlying database. For example, errors in band gap due to the systematic underestimation of the DFT-PBE method will propagate from MP, and biases in structural diversity will propagate too (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, oversampling of battery-related compounds, or of certain structure prototypes, <span class="italic">etc.</span>). It is also suggested to use caution when assuming Vegard’s law to interpolate properties; rather than an exact value, linear interpolation across a tieline gives a possible range of properties. To address these limitations, future work involves including non-commensurate alloy systems, completing “unmatched” tielines, computing ordered members, bowing, and estimating entropic contributions. Nevertheless, we hope this tool is of value to the community, and demonstrates the essentialness of considering tunability when performing materials discovery screenings.</p>

        <span class="bold">Seán R.

That said, the results remain relevant for CdCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>-treated CdTe, as Te<small><sub>i</sub></small> and V<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> defects will still be present, however their concentration may be affected by the CdCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> treatment. For instance, V<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> can form the A-centre complex with Cl<small><sub>Te</sub></small>,<small><sup>1</sup></small> though this is not a very strongly-bound complex<small><sup>2</sup></small> and so the concentration of ‘free’ V<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> would not be expected to significantly reduce due to this complex formation. The potential diffusion of Cd into CdTe with the CdCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> treatment could, however, reduce the concentration of V<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> by filling the vacant sites and removing the defects. For Te<small><sub>i</sub></small>, again we expect no strong complex formation due to CdCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> treatment,<small><sup>2</sup></small> but the elevated temperatures and more Cd-rich environment during treatment will thermodynamically disfavour Te-related defects such as Te<small><sub>i</sub></small> and Te<small><sub>Cd</sub></small>, and so we would expect a decrease in the concentration of these species during CdCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> treatment, with an exponential dependence on the treatment temperature.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">The recent developments with Se-graded CdTe solar cells are exciting for the community, but the mechanism behind the extremely long carrier lifetimes obtained in these materials seems little understood at this point.

      <p class="otherpara">Tackling their identification is a very active area of development in the field of computational defect modelling, requiring structure searching techniques which can efficiently navigate the defect potential energy surfaces (PESs) and identify these local minima.

Recently we have proposed a method which demonstrates high performance (&gt;95%) and good efficiency,<small><sup>1</sup></small> and so hopefully this and future developments will allow us to advance the accuracy and reliability of computational defect predictions; providing the full picture of potential defect configurations and thus impact on device performance.</p>

        <span class="bold">Thomas P. Weiss</span> asked: In the literature, several theoretical studies exist dealing with materials screening for photovoltaic (PV) applications. One of the criteria is that no deep defects should exist in the middle of the bandgap for a good PV material. However, this paper demonstrates that metastable defects can significantly contribute to recombination. Also, it seems that metastable defects exist in abundance, in particular for low symmetry crystal structures.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Therefor the question: to what degree can previous screening studies (without the consideration of metastable defects) be trusted when a particular (calculated) material does not indicate deep defects?</p>

While our work and other recent reports demonstrate that just because a set of <span class="italic">ground-state</span> defects do not present deep levels in the gap, this does not necessarily mean that defect-mediated non-radiative recombination will be slow, as metastable defects can provide alternative rapid carrier capture pathways. In this way, I think previous screening studies which predict materials showing a lack of deep defects (when ignoring metastable states) are decent indicators that those materials show some initial promise and may warrant further investigation, but cannot be trusted as reliable predictors of their actual recombination behaviour.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Seán R. Kavanagh</span> answered: There are several longstanding puzzles regarding measured defect levels in CdTe – in fact this was one of our main motivations for applying these newly-developed theories to this material, to see if we can resolve some of these questions. One of the main difficulties in identifying defect levels in CdTe <span class="italic">via</span> DLTS or PICTS methods is the ‘clustering’ of deep levels in certain regions of the band gap. We find Te<small><sub>i</sub></small>, Te<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> and V<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> all present defect levels in the 0.3–0.4 eV range above the VBM, in good agreement with experimental results. However, many of the experimental reports employ different sample preparation methods and show dispersion in the reported values, which in addition to the similar concentration dependence on growth conditions for these Te-rich defects makes their distinction very tricky. We find close agreement in terms of measured cross-sections, energy level position and concentrations with our calculations for Te<small><sub>i</sub></small>, but would hesitate to make conclusions without the full context of all intrinsic defects present. We are performing this analysis now and hope to publish soon with a detailed comparison between the calculated and experimental recombination activity of defects in CdTe. Our work on V<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> helped to clarify some of these issues, and a central point from this study is that the ruling-out of certain defects as potential recombination sites based off their ground-state energetics may have been imprudent, as we show metastable effects can be key. We believe these results will help to obtain a more accurate picture of recombination-active defects in CdTe and clarify some longstanding controversies over the atomic origin of the measured levels.</p>

How should we understand disorder in terms of the stoichiometry? <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Off-stoichiometry in a material is always thought of as a disorder!</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn V. Sopiha</span> replied: Our take is that the cationic disorder and off-stoichiometry are two distinct properties, which do not correlate but might nonetheless yield similar effects on the macroscale, including band tails.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Specifically, the cationic disorder is explained by the multiplicity of low-energy polytopes that can also be viewed as the incorporation of antisite domain boundaries in different quantities (typically the picture is simplified to swapping of cations, but the process is more complex as the system strives to maintain low deviation from the octet rule; see ref. 1). The resulting loss of long-range order and spatial inhomogeneities in the lattice at the nanometer scale lead to band edge perturbations associated with the band tails.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As we show in this work, the off-stoichiometry is incorporated into the lattice in the form of group-I-poor planar defects, which break the crystal symmetry and constitute spatial inhomogeneities with slightly different properties compared to the adjacent domains, most notably the valence band edge. The spatial perturbations in VBM and band gaps could be the source of band tails ascribed to the increased cationic disorder with respect to off-stoichiometry (without the actual cationic disorder being increased).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">At the same time, our calculations suggest that there is no direct correlation between the off-stoichiometry and cationic disorder. The parameter we looked at is the above-hull enthalpy of polytopes with CuAu-type coordination, which stays roughly constant with respect to off-stoichiometry (these results will be published shortly).</p>

We expect that the VBM position in OVC is progressively lowered with decreasing [I]/[III] ratio, while the CBM level is less affected. This assumption derives from the fact that the valance band edge in chalcopyrites is composed of antibonding I–VI states, removing which though lowering group-I content shifts the VBM downwards and thereby widens the band gap. Recently, the band alignment between 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>2 and 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>5<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>8 phases was computed for a wide family of I–III–VI systems, suggesting that the CBM is also shifted downwards with lowering [I]/[III] (see ref. 2). However, we note that, based on our calculations, the unstable OVC structures from earlier works have narrower band gaps compared to those of the stable structures identified in our study, meaning that the CBM lowering reported earlier is likely overestimated. Furthermore, unlike earlier works, we always observe the band gap widening with decreasing [I]/[III] ratio, meaning that the VBM shift downwards must be greater than the corresponding shift in the CBM (if any). The lower position of VBM and unaffected CBM in the Cu-poor Cu–In–Se has also been indirectly observed in our calculations (also not shown) in the layer-resolved DOS for Cu<small><sub>10</sub></small>In<small><sub>12</sub></small>Se<small><sub>23</sub></small>. This change is consistent with the observed flattening of the VBM bands and the resulting enhancement of effective mass of holes moving across the Cu-poor region. We did not construct layer-resolved DOS for other I–III–VI yet, but we expect similar behaviour.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The impact of OVCs on the device is not completely clear at the moment, but it is probably dependent on the OVCs distribution, their composition, and the system in question. If we talk about a thin surface layer, as often assumed for CIGSe, it can have a mildly positive effect owing to the repulsion of holes away from the heterojunction due to the lower VBM of the OVC (see ref. 2 and references therein). On the other hand, if CBM forms a large cliff configuration, the impact can be detrimental due to the trapping of the electrons.

If I understood your question correctly, you are asking to what extent the errors in our DFT calculations (which you suspect from the experimentally observed structures being above the convex hulls presented in our work) may influence our conclusions. A short answer – not much, with the exception of a few less explored systems (primarily, with III = Al). To begin a long answer, a few things need to be clarified: (1) the “literature” structures include both experimental and previously reported DFT structures. (2) Structural isomorphs generated by isovalent replacements in the previously reported structures were also added as “literature” structures. (3) The “literature” structures also include ordered defect compounds, all of which were reproduced by our algorithm (but still labelled as “literature” , to give credit to the original works). Thus, one cannot judge from the presented convex hull about the possibly erroneous predictions of the ground states. However, we indeed observed a few of them, although for the 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>5<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>8 and 0<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>2<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>3 compositions only.

This case is already described in our manuscript and it could be explained by a variety of reasons, including (i) inaccuracy of the employed functional (we indeed found that the energy difference between these two structures changes considerably when PBEsol or SCAN functional is used instead of PBE), (ii) stabilization by the entropy contribution to the free energy, and (iii) experimental misidentification or our misinterpretation of the available experimental data.

Adair asked why I–Ga–S are special compared to I–Al–S and I–In–S, reciting the discussion in our paper (see Fig. 5, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00105e">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00105e</a>). The dependence on ionic radius was our first guess as well, but the considerations of critical ionic size ratios explain the stability of I–In–S <span class="italic">vs.</span> I–Ga–S only. The reason for the stability of spinel structures in I–III–S with smaller III = Al remains an open question to us.

        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn V. Sopiha</span> responded: Our results prove that the model of clustering (2V<small><sub>Cu</sub></small> + In<small><sub>Cu</sub></small>) complexes is obsolete (although it can still be a useful simplification for some systems). To our knowledge, the view you mention (which is now dominant) has been developed in works by Zunger in the late 1990s (see ref. 1 and 2). The authors searched for the most stable arrangement of the complexes in CuInSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> and found that it corresponds to the stacking along [110] direction in the conventional cell. Based on this knowledge, a hitherto unknown, relatively stable structure of CuIn<small><sub>5</sub></small>Se<small><sub>8</sub></small> was proposed (which has since become prototypical). As you can see, the notion of ODCs being formed <span class="italic">via</span> stacking of complexes was built into the original structural model BY DESIGN. However, it has serious shortcomings, one of which is that no stable structure of CuIn<small><sub>3</sub></small>Se<small><sub>5</sub></small> and other compositions could be produced in this way. Instead, as a crude approximation, the properties of these ODCs were estimated as weighted averages of those for CuInSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CuIn<small><sub>5</sub></small>Se<small><sub>8</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In this work, we analyzed a lot more possible arrangements (limited only by the cell size and zinc-blende-derived symmetry), with the structures considered by Zunger being only a small subset. We found stable structures of CuIn<small><sub>3</sub></small>Se<small><sub>5</sub></small>, Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>In<small><sub>4</sub></small>Se<small><sub>7</sub></small>, and other ODCs, none of which could be formed by clustering of defect complexes. Moreover, for the CuIn<small><sub>5</sub></small>Se<small><sub>8</sub></small> composition, a variety of structures more stable than the one discovered by Zunger (up to 2 meV per atom) were identified by our search, proving that defect complexes are NOT the building blocks of ODCs. From this conclusion it also follows that vacancies in the ODC structures are NOT V<small><sub>Cu</sub></small> but simply empty cationic sides that are an integral part of the structure.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As an aside, I think the vacancy phases can indeed be called ordered, and it even follows from my interpretation of your findings. When you see vacancies predominantly on the 2a Wyckoff sites, it means that their distribution is not random. The vacancies are (at least partially) ordered, forming (001) planes with the spacing of <span class="italic">c</span>/2. This can also be interpreted as a change in crystal symmetry (to stannite-type + Cu/In disorder on 2b/4d), but I view it as a matter of representation. It is also worth remembering that fine structural features could have easily been missed out if a specific symmetry was imposed during the refinement of the diffraction data, and they could instead be ascribed to disordering. In this regard, it could be interesting to try refining the diffraction patterns with the structural models uncovered by our DFT calculation with the addition of partial disorder expected at finite temperatures.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, I agree that the term “ordered defect compounds” is less appropriate as the vacancies are not defects in a classical sense (they are not formed by removing a specific species).</p>

        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn V. Sopiha</span> responded: Thanks for the recommendations. These works indeed provide an experimental perspective on Cu deficiency in CIGSe, but they are basically adopting the same point-defect picture as described in our introduction section. The estimations of homogeneity region width from publication no. 1 are also complementary to other works discussed in our article. Still, we recognise the potential of further model refinement through cross-verification with experiment, in which the results from the works you recommended could be pivotal. We plan such analysis after accounting for the partial cationic disorder (to reproduce experimental growth/treatment conditions), which is planned to be done using Monte-Carlo simulations in the future.</p>

        <span class="bold">Rafael Jaramillo</span> asked: Differential diffusivity can produce a photovoltaic effect. Would you expect a substantial PV effect due to differential diffusivity near these extended defects? If so, what are the voltage and length scales involved, and could these perhaps be measured? This could be a persistent yet hard-to-pin-down source of voltage loss.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn V. Sopiha</span> responded: Great question. We think that Cu-poor planar defects could indeed be a source of voltage losses in CIGSe, but our explanation is somewhat different from the diffusivity difference. Specifically, considering that VBM in the Cu-poor regions is lower compared to the adjacent CIGSe domains, a hole concentration gradient (with hole depletion inside the Cu-poor planar defects) should be expected, which would yield a kind of local photovoltaic effect. The spatial extension of the gradient should not exceed the average separation between the planar defects, which is ∼6 nm for CIGSe with [Cu]/[III] = 0.9. Hence, bearing in mind that the planar defect arrangement would lose out-of-plane periodicity and possibly form an intertwined 3D network at finite temperatures, the phenomenon we expect is more like potential fluctuations. Very roughly, the VBM variations can be estimated as the difference in band gaps of 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>2 and 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>5<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>8, which for Cu–In–Se is 0.3–0.4 eV. It is logical to assume that the magnitude of the resulting voltage perturbations is below that. However, we must admit that, for the planar defect with a thickness of only a few nanometers, band edges cannot be properly defined and should not be overinterpreted due to quantum effects. In addition, we expect that planar defects exhibit a very rich point defect chemistry distinct from that of the adjacent ideal CIGSe domains. Electrostatic potential perturbations and the resulting photovoltaic effect might emerge if the planar defects host charged point defect species, but it would take a dedicated study to evaluate its magnitude.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Experimental measurement for a single planar defect seems unfeasible, too, because they have not been detected in the first place yet. On the other hand, indirect signs could be analyzed by, for instance, measuring the absorber properties <span class="italic">vs.</span> [Cu]/[III] (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the concentration of planar defects). To this end, the knowledge that Cu-poor CIGSe generally exhibits better photovoltaic performance suggests that voltage losses do not increase with lowering [Cu]/[III], at least in the region of practical relevance. Thus, the planar defects seem to not induce large voltage losses. On the other hand, the planar defects might pose some benign properties that make Cu-poor CIGSe absorbers superior, and a combination of these effects is being observed experimentally. In any case, further research is needed to answer your question properly and in detail.</p>

        <span class="bold">Seán R.

Do think that the stability of ODCs at intermediate compositions is related to the propensity for structural disorder in these materials?

        <span class="bold">Cara Hawkins</span> returned to the discussion of the information presented by Rachel Woods-Robinson and commented: As an experimentalist working on the design and discovery of new solar absorbing materials, this work is really exciting. I wondered if you might be able to talk a bit more about how this database will operate.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> replied: The alloys database and framework can be accessed in three different ways. First is by the graphical interface on the Materials Project website (https://materialsproject.org; note, you may temporarily have to visit https://next-gen.materialsproject.org to ensure you see the latest features). Then you can go to the “materials detail page” of a specific crystalline compound, scroll down and view the alloy system that this material is part of, and filter that system based on a variety of parameters of interest. This will allow for basic searches. Second, the database can be accessed <span class="italic">via</span> the Materials Project’s API using a Python interface, where you can query all the tielines and perform your own analysis (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, construct your own “formula alloy pair”). This is typically done in a Jupyter notebook, and the website will have one-click links available to a pre-installed notebook for new users to try out the code without having to install anything on their own computer. Using the API will allow researchers to design more personalized searches. For example, in our paper<small><sup>1</sup></small> in order to screen for tielines of interest as p-type transparent top contacts for PV, we used the same API to filter for tielines in which PBE band gap and hole effective mass lie within a particular range of interest, and also screened based on the stability of all tielines between a given pair of chemical formulas (the “formula alloy pair”). This is an important point, because we want to emphasize that we generated the plots and analysis in the paper using the same publicly-available API that others will have access to, so these are fully reproducible. Third, all our code will soon be open source in the “pymatgen-analysis-alloys” package (https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen-analysis-alloys), so if you are interested you can add new functionalities or properties, add your own dataset as endpoints, or use the package to construct a new alloys database from a different compound database (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, AFLOW<small><sup>2</sup></small> or OQMD<small><sup>3</sup></small>). We would be glad for others to get involved in the development and use of these tools, and welcome anybody is who is interested to contact us, regardless of previous experience.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> answered: The specific case of, say, a stable ternary alloy polymorph that is structurally incommensurate with both its binary endpoints would indeed be missed by our database as it stands today. The construction of our database is robust against small structural distortions and, indeed, it is not necessary for the alloy endpoints to necessarily be of the same spacegroup to be deemed close enough to be structurally commensurate (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, consider a small polar distortion), although most are, but this will not catch all cases.<br/><div class="image_table"><table><tr><td colspan="3" class="imgHolder" id="imgugr2"><a href="/image/article/2022/FD/d2fd90058k/d2fd90058k-u2_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: d2fd90058k-u2.tif" src="/image/article/2022/FD/d2fd90058k/d2fd90058k-u2.gif"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class="pushTitleRight"> </td><td><a id="ugr2"/><span id="ugr2"/></td><td class="pushTitleLeft"> </td></tr></table></div></p>
      <p class="otherpara">More broadly, this approach and high-throughput computational approaches in general may miss other experimentally-synthesizable materials. This oversampling of some structures and undersampling of others can be the result of biases such as which structures are present in nature, which structures are most common in technological applications (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, zinc blende-derived structures for PV), which materials the database curators are most interested in, among other biases. Such “missing” structures in the alloy database can be divided mainly into two categories: (1) structures in which one endpoint compound exists in the underlying compound database (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Materials Project) but a commensurate endpoint does not, and therefore an alloy pair tieline has not been constructed, and (2) structures that have yet to be identified in the compound database and therefore also do not appear in the alloy database (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> no endpoint compounds exist at all). There is also another case whereby (3) an alloy pair tieline may be discarded as “unstable” according to our enthalpy-based “formula alloy pair” analysis, but due to entropic effects it could actually be stabilized experimentally.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Towards the first case, part of the motivation of the “formula alloy pair” analysis is to demonstrate cases in which more data would be useful to add to the Materials Project database. For example, the left-hand side of the attached figure shows the formula alloy pair for PV absorber candidate (Bi<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Sb<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> as constructed from the current version of the alloy database. MP has structures corresponding the <span class="italic">Pnma</span> phase for both endpoints Bi<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> and Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>, however the Bi<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> phases of <span class="italic">P</span>4<small><sub>2</sub></small>/<span class="italic">nmc</span> and <span class="italic">R</span><img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_0033_0304.gif" alt="[3 with combining macron]"/><span class="italic">m</span> have no corresponding commensurate crystal structure for Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>, and so no alloy pair tieline for these phases can be constructed. Therefore, this analysis has identified “missing” data that can inform future calculations, which could then be added to the MP database and incorporated into a new iteration of the alloy database. As a result of the Materials Project infrastructure, this new alloy database will be automatically rebuilt as additional structures are added to MP. The right-hand side of the figure below also shows how the formula alloy pair plot could be reconstructed with the addition of new data (note: stars represent hypothetical data!), and how this new data could indeed change the computed stability across chemical space. One next step could be identifying similar scenarios with “missing” endpoints across all formula alloy pairs in our database, computing these structures, and then adding them to the MP database.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In terms of the second case – “missing” crystal structures that are not present in databases yet – there has been a lot of fantastic research into this space, ranging from data-mined ionic substitution to evolutionary algorithms, as well as new algorithms enabled by machine learning. The MP database has grown recently to include new crystallographic structures, and as new materials get added to compounds databases (from both case 1 and case 2), the alloys database can grow alongside.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The third case, in which experimentally synthesizable structures are missed computationally because they are not the lowest enthalpy structures, is also important.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christopher Savory</span> asked: Your database appears like it could be a powerful tool – though the stability of the mixed systems appears to be purely based on stability above hull. Are there any plans to introduce corrections on entropic terms, particularly configurational entropy, or will it remain based on ground state DFT total energies?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> answered: The stability metric used in the alloys database is indeed just a crude estimate based on the enthalpy of both endpoints, so a more rigorous treatment including entropic contributions would make this a more useful and accurate tool. However, there is always a tradeoff with high-throughput methods in scale <span class="italic">versus</span> accuracy: we emphasize that the intended purpose of our tool is to help a scientist filter through a large set of potential alloys, and to use this to prioritize which ones would benefit from this more detailed treatment. Our alloy database includes &gt;600<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 “alloy pair” tielines, each consisting of a unique chemical and structural space, and &gt;19<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 “formula alloy pair” tielines, each consisting of a unique chemical space. It is noted that there are other hypothetical tielines not present yet in this alloy database because structurally commensurate endpoints do not yet exist in the underlying compound database; these are flagged (as mentioned in my previous reply), but without the corresponding endpoint present, no tieline can be drawn.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Scaling up entropy calculations to tens of thousands of tielines would be computationally exhaustive, but it might be possible to do this for hundreds of promising or interesting tielines, and this is our intent for future work. Obtaining reliable temperature-dependent phase diagrams for these tielines is our dream, but it is unclear how feasible this will be in a high-throughput context and, indeed, which approach to adopt. We are considering the Generalized Quasi-Chemical Approximation (GQCA)<small><sup>1</sup></small> but it is unclear if this will be accurate enough; a full cluster expansion might be better, but the ability to generate automated cluster expansions at scale is still in its infancy, and not something we are pursuing with this work. We welcome further input or collaboration on this topic and agree it is essential to address in the long term.</p>

        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn V.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> responded: Many complex alloy systems will fall out naturally from this method. Alloys are designed as “alloy pairs” first, and then complexity is built up by linking “alloy pairs” into “alloy systems” which defines co-alloying of multiple elements and sublattices. To the examples mentioned, (Cd,Zn)(S,O) would be an alloy subsystem of the larger wurtzite (or zinc blende, or other metastable polymorph) binary alloy system (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, consisting of individual pairs CdS–ZnS, CdS–CdO, ZnS–ZnO), and (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)(S,Se)<small><sub>2</sub></small> would be an alloy subsystem of the chalcopyrite ternary alloy system (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a> for the latter example). A full alloy system can be filtered by cation, anion, and other properties such that a subsystem of interest can be represented; this could be performed for A = FA, MA, Cs, Rb, B = Pb, C = I for the example mentioned in the question; to date, we only support filtering by single atom ions on the web interface, but a user proficient in Python could filter by ions like FA, MA. Eventually, one can merge alloy systems such that binaries are connected to structurally commensurate ternaries (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> binary zincblende could merge with ternary chalcopyrite), which are then connected to quaternaries, <span class="italic">etc.</span> We are designing a platform such that these systems and subsystems can be easily queried by the user, and so that systems can be queried for properties of interest (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, where in a given system could you alloy to find a band gap near 1.5 eV and lattice constant near 4 Å?).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The inclusion of vacancies and corresponding topotactic alloys could be an interesting addition to this method; we have considered the problem, though it is currently not part of the framework. Currently, the database requires sites to be occupied in order for two structures to be designated “commensurate”. Our code will soon be released and is open source, so this is something that an interested researcher could add!</p>

        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> returned to the paper by Seán R. Kavanagh and asked: Typically, DFT defect calculations assume thermodynamic equilibrium. However, light absorption and photocurrent extraction in solar cells occur under non-equilibrium conditions. Do you imagine the non-equilibrium defects that govern solar cell performance are not appropriately accounted for in our typical defect calculations for PV materials? Should we change the way we do defect calculations for PV?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Seán R. Kavanagh</span> responded: Yes I believe this work and other recent reports in the field (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> work from Thomas Weiss,<small><sup>1</sup></small> our work on V<small><sub>Cd</sub></small> (ref. 2) and other papers discussed in our introduction) show that metastable defects can play crucial roles in the e–h recombination process in semiconductors – particularly emerging ionic-covalent materials like Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">I believe non-equilibrium/metastable defects are not appropriately accounted for in our typical defect calculation workflow, stemming from (1) the difficulty in locating these structures in the first place, (2) the large computational cost of calculating non-radiative recombination behaviour, particularly for a range of defects at once and (3) our lack of understanding of their importance (aided by these difficulties in calculating them). Thankfully, these issues are diminishing each year with (1) improved algorithms for identifying these species (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> our defect structure searching method:<small><sup>3</sup></small> and this is a very active research direction at the moment), (2) exponentially growing computational power and efficiency and (3) increasing understanding of their importance as in this and other works.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">So yes I think we need to change the way we do defect calculations, by expanding our search space to obtain the full picture of potential defect configurations (using structure searching methods such as ref. 3) and then determining all potential recombination pathways introduced by these states. In doing so, I believe we will dramatically enhance the accuracy of our predictions of solar cell performance and defect behaviour in general.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan J. S. Scragg</span> opened a general discussion of the paper by Aron Walsh: I agree with the comments on defect tolerance. I want to remind everyone that “defect tolerance” only has meaning with respect to a material <span class="italic">property</span>. For example, it is meaningless to say that “material X is defect tolerant”. But it is meaningful to say that <span class="italic">e.g.</span> carrier lifetime, PL intensity, conductivity, <span class="italic">etc.</span> in material X are defect tolerant. We need to be precise with this important term if it is not to lose its meaning altogether. In addition, let’s think more of defect tolerance as being on a scale, rather than being a binary is/is not characteristic.</p>

        <span class="bold">Alice Sheppard</span> commented: From my experience of reading literature, we only see the publication of positive results and a lot of us could just be making the exact same mistakes as others previously. Should we encourage the publication of less successful results, rather than only if we see an improvement of device efficiency?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> answered: Yes, this should definitely be encouraged. Indeed, data from failed experiments is highly valuable for training machine learning models, which was recently demonstrated for the case of hydrothermal materials synthesis.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">David J. Fermin</span> remarked: Following on the question by Alice Sheppard with regards to reporting ‘negative’ experimental results, are there ‘negative’ computational results? Are they usually published?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> responded: It becomes more difficult to define a negative result for materials modelling. There are cases where a lot of data is generated, for example in crystal structure prediction or property searches, that goes largely unused. But now even information on high-energy polymorphs or unphysical combinations of elements is valuable for training more robust statistical models. So computational researchers are encouraged to publish datasets that are as complete as possible.</p>

        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> remarked: I agree with you on the importance of the dielectric constant of an absorber for screening of charged defects (as discussed in your paper <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00135G">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00135g</a>). We once believed that one of the reasons why kesterite wouldn’t perform as well as CIGS was because of lower dielectric constant of kesterite (which is 7–8) than that of CIGS (which is over 15). How sensitive is the defect tolerance to dielectric constant? For example, if there are two materials – one with dielectric constant of 5 and the other with 10, how much is the material with a dielectric constant of 10 better than the one with 5?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> responded: Thank you for raising this point. I fully agree and the lower dielectric constant for kesterite crystals is also found from first-principles calculations. When you look at the equations determining the interaction of electrons with charged defects, the dielectric constant appears in several places. In general the dependence is 1/<span class="italic">ε</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>, for example in the Sommerfeld factor for carrier capture (see eqn (3) in ref. 1). So for the same defect concentration, a host material with <span class="italic">ε</span> = 10 would have a fourfold tolerance to carrier trapping compared to <span class="italic">ε</span> = 5.</p>

        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> said: I found your notion of low thermal conductivity very interesting. In a way, one could say that we might be looking for thermoelectric materials, too, which combine high electric conductivity with low thermal conductivity. Based on the work in thermoelectrics, it is evident that both cannot be tuned independently of each other but are related in some way. Do you believe that it may be possible to define a sweet-spot for solar cells, where the relation between thermal conductivity and electric conductivity is optimal – similar to the Shockley–Queisser limit?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> answered: Yes, there should be an optimal range for a given device architecture. This may be to slow hot carrier cooling or to reduce non-radiative recombination rates. I would like to see more detailed device models and numerical analysis on this topic in the future.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jens Wenzel Andreasen</span> commented: I have a collaboration with the spin-out company Lightnovo (https://www.lightnovo.com) who are developing several technologies based on Raman spectroscopy, including a microscope to map large areas in thin films with “2.5D” resolution. They are interested in PV materials with grain sizes upwards of 1 micrometer. Please contact me if you have for instance low-dimensional materials that could be suitable, and where there is an interest in mapping out crystalline phase distribution and orientations.</p>
