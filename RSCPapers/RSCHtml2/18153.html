Various types of G6-TMD nanomaterials, such as nanosheets, nanotubes and quantum dot nano-objects and flower-like nanostructures, have been synthesized. High thermodynamic stability under ambient conditions, even in atomically thin form, made nanosheets of these inorganic semiconductors a valuable asset in the existing library of two-dimensional (2D) materials, along with the well-known semimetallic graphene and insulating hexagonal boron nitride. G6-TMDs generally possess an appropriate bandgap (1–2 eV) which is tunable by size and dimensionality and changes from indirect to direct in monolayer nanosheets, intriguing for (opto)electronic, sensing, and solar energy harvesting applications. Moreover, rich intercalation chemistry and abundance of catalytically active edge sites make them promising for fabrication of novel energy storage devices and advanced catalysts. In this review, we provide an overview on all aspects of the basic science, physicochemical properties and characterization techniques as well as all existing production methods and applications of G6-TMD nanomaterials in a comprehensive yet concise treatment. Particular emphasis is placed on establishing a linkage between the features of production methods and the specific needs of rapidly growing applications of G6-TMDs to develop a production-application selection guide. Based on this selection guide, a framework is suggested for future research on how to bridge existing knowledge gaps and improve current production methods towards technological application of G6-TMD nanomaterials.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2018/NH/c7nh00137a/c7nh00137a-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c7nh00137a-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2018/NH/c7nh00137a/c7nh00137a-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

      <h2 id="sect688"><span class="a_heading">1. Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>In recent years, we have witnessed a resurgence of interest in a rather long-known and well-studied class of materials, called group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (G6-TMDs), including most notably MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MoTe<small><sub>2</sub></small>, WS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>. A class sharing less than 100 papers per year in the scientific community before 2010, mainly as dry lubricants and hydrodesulfurization catalysts, today has become a booming research field ranging from (opto)electronics to sensors, energy storage and catalysis with above 3000 yearly published papers and several patents being filed monthly.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Historically, G6-TMDs (in particular MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WS<small><sub>2</sub></small>), as inorganic analogues of graphite, have followed the footsteps of carbon nanomaterials and achieved most of their advancement and success, although usually with some delay. The discovery of carbon fullerenes by Smalley and coworkers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> in 1985 and carbon nanotubes by Iijima<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> in 1991 was followed by the discovery of WS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> fullerenes and nanotubes between 1992 and 1995.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3–5</span></sup></a> Thus it was quite natural that the original report of discovery of graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) carbon crystal, by Novoselov, Geim and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> in 2004, was immediately followed by some preliminary experiments on TMDs such as MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> However, it took about seven years for G6-TMDs to step out of the shadow of the famous graphene and establish their own identity. Current intensive research on G6-TMDs has been stimulated by a series of follow-up theoretical predictions and experimental observations of unexpected electronic and optical properties in nanosheets of this family of materials, especially their most representative member, MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In 2010, Mak <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> kindled the first sparks by reporting the tunable bandgap in MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets with respect to the thickness of nanosheets. More surprisingly, they found a transition from an indirect bandgap of 1.3 eV in bulk MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> to a very technologically favorable direct bandgap of 1.9 eV when MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> was thinned down to a single molecular layer. Direct bandgap means stronger light emission and higher luminescence quantum efficiency of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayer nanosheets, which is intriguing for fabrication of novel light emitting diodes, solar cells and photodetectors. A subsequent report on a single-layer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> transistor with a high electron mobility and superior on/off current ratio by Kis and coworkers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> in 2011, definitely ignited the field. These findings propelled accumulated efforts of researchers, who struggled with semimetallic zero-bandgap graphene to a newly rediscovered 2D semiconductor, a MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheet, and its other family members, such as WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> and MoTe<small><sub>2</sub></small>. In fact, the MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheet the builders rejected in 2004, due to its low electron mobility, has become a cornerstone. Although there was some systematic overestimation in the reported high electron mobilities of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> transistors by Kis’ group in 2011 (see Section 6.1. (opto)electronics), a new hope appeared that was pursued with great enthusiasm and soon after yielded many fruitful results. Over the past 6 to 7 years, the basic science, characterization techniques and production methods of the whole family of G6-TMDs have been updated and revised, leading to many novel scientific and technological advancements. Such rapid progress even has shifted paradigms of traditional applications of G6-TMDs, such as lubrication and catalysis, because several novel and efficient production methods have been emerged and a better understanding has been gained in recent years.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">G6-TMDs are members of a broader family of materials called transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs). According to the definition recommended by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), a transition element or a transition metal (since they are all metals) is an element that has incomplete d sub-shells as a free atom or a commonly occurring cation.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10,11</span></sup></a> Based on this definition, groups 4 to 10 on the periodic table as well as some elements of groups 3 and 11 can be regarded as transition metals (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> Chalcogen is also the generic name of the elements in group 16 of the periodic table, which comprises O, S, Se, Te and the two radioactive elements Po and Lv.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,13</span></sup></a> Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) constitute a large and important family of TMCs with the generalized formula of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small>, where M is a transition metal and X is a chalcogen.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14,15</span></sup></a> TMDs have been known and studied for decades and cover a wide range of electronic properties from insulators (HfS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and ZnS<small><sub>2</sub></small>), through semiconductors (MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and ReS<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and semimetals (WTe<small><sub>2</sub></small>, NbTe<small><sub>2</sub></small>), to true metals (NbS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CoTe<small><sub>2</sub></small>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> Over 60 transition metal dichalcogenides are known and about 40 of them have layered crystal structure, which are predominantly TMDs of groups 4 to 7.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14,16</span></sup></a> Among these layered TMDs, the group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (G6-TMDs) are of special scientific and technological importance.

      <p class="otherpara">There are some high quality reviews on the synthesis, properties, and applications of TMD nanomaterials, particularly G6-TMDs.

        <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a> illustrates the approach and the key differentiating aspects of our review. To fulfil the needs of many existing and potential technological applications, we aim to compile and to consolidate information on science and production of all G6-TMD nanomaterials in a cognitive framework appealing to scientists and engineers of various disciplines. While our emphasis is on 2D nanosheets, we also review other nanomaterials of this group such as, 0D quantum dots, 1D nanotubes and 3D nanoflowers. For this purpose, based on Web of Science, a database of more than 4500 highly cited articles in high-impact journals with carefully chosen keywords to cover all G6-TMD nanomaterials from 2004 to 2017 has been prepared and thoroughly studied. In the first four sections, a practical review of the basic science and structural, electronic and optical properties of G6-TMDs as well as their characterization toolbox is provided. Then a systematic classification of all different existing production methods of various nanomaterials of G6-TMDs is presented. Although there are a number of review articles on some specific production methods of 2D TMD nanosheets,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32,40–42</span></sup></a> a comprehensive treatment of science and all production methods of all G6-TMD nanomaterials is necessary and still lacking. In this respect, all production methods are first categorized into top-down and bottom-up approaches. Then, top-down methods are divided into four main subcategories including (i) mechanical cleavage, (ii) liquid phase exfoliation, (iii) intercalation and exfoliation and (iv) thinning. Bottom-up methods are also divided into two main subcategories of (i) vapour deposition and (ii) solution-based synthesis (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>). Finally, these six main subcategories are further segmented into 18 distinct types of production methods and are discussed in detail. Some of these production methods, such as thermal annealing, etching, sputter deposition and pulsed laser deposition, are often overlooked by researchers, while, as will be discussed later, these methods have great potential and promise for numerous advanced device applications.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">We also categorize all reported applications of G6-TMD nanomaterials into five main areas, based on the structural and functional features of the nanomaterials needed by each application. The pertinent subsections, as indicated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>, are (i) (opto)electronics, (ii) sensors, (iii) energy storage, (iv) catalysis and (v) emerging applications. Each subsection is organized in a way so that first the basic concepts are briefly introduced. Then, potential and utilized production methods for the mentioned applications in that subsection are discussed and the current challenges are critically analysed to outline the possible solutions and pathways for future research. More importantly, in this section we present a production-application selection guide in order to provide insight into the fundamental question of “which production method is suitable for which application?”. This selection guide is intended to address the needs of those specialists seeking for better alternative production methods for their specific application or possible new applications of their produced nanomaterials, without going through all details of the article.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In the last section, conclusions arising from our literature review are summarized and a framework is suggested for important and high-priority research topics in the field of G6-TMD nanomaterials. From the fundamental science perspective, unclear problems and open questions along with unexplored areas and phenomena are addressed. Steps that should be taken to improve existing production methods and the possibility of combining multiple methods to exploit their complementary advantages are also discussed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Finally, we would like to note that our review article is intended not to serve as an additional exhaustive data-gathering and cumbersome listing of references, but rather to provide an overview in a balanced and homogenized style on the field of G6-TMDs in a comprehensive yet concise treatment. The main objectives of our review are: (i) to portray the current science of G6-TMD nanomaterials from an application-oriented point of view; (ii) to provide readers with a working knowledge of all production methods through a critical and comparative presentation approach; (iii) to stimulate exchange of ideas between researchers working on different types of production methods; (iv) to outline the main targets and future research directions that should be pursued to improve existing production methods and develop new methods; (v) to draw attention of researchers to the wide available range of production methods for existing/emerging applications beyond the routine methods. In accordance with the purpose of the reader, the article can be used selectively and flexibly. Those readers that are intimately familiar with the subject may not need to read the article sequentially from beginning to end. Instead, they can start with the first two pages of Section 6 (Production-Application selection guide) and after checking <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab8">Table 8</a>, then continue with their desired topics, from the basic science and characterization methods to specific production methods and applications. Those specialists and advanced readers who are primarily looking for new thinking and novel ideas, will find Section 7 (Conclusion and outlook) particularly interesting and useful. It is sincerely hoped that this comprehensive review article will become a major reference work on group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides for many years. Therefore, a special emphasis is placed on using a consistent notation, terminology and abbreviations throughout the text in an effort to standardize definitions and nomenclatures of this multidisciplinary field.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">Classification of nanomaterials can be made based on several criteria such as composition, phase, crystal structure and dimensionality as well as electrical, magnetic, optical, thermal and chemical properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> A classifying system, named “nano-tree”, has been developed in this regard under the ISO/TR 11360 Nanotechnologies—methodology for the classification and categorization of nanomaterials. Among possible classifying systems, the one based on dimensionality is the most versatile and ubiquitous due to the inherent relationship between dimensionality and various physical and chemical properties, which makes this system more useful for qualitative prediction of the properties of each category. However, classification of nanomaterials based on dimensionality is challenging due to some considerations. For example, (i) what is the exact size below which a material can be considered a nanomaterial? (ii) Which lengths in material should be considered as characteristic lengths, especially for irregular shapes? (iii) Is observation of quantum size effects a necessary condition for nanomaterials? (iv) Which dimensions of nanomaterial should be considered in the classification, only external dimensions or internal dimensions of constituent fine structures? The last point may cause confusion when for instance a composite of nanoparticles and nanotubes in a bulk matrix needs to be categorized.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Gleiter<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> was the first one who attempted to systematically classify nanomaterials; however, his classification was based on chemical composition and thermodynamic equilibrium state rather than dimensionality and thus, there were some limitations in the classification, for example, important nanomaterial categories such as fullerene and nanotubes were not taken into account. Pokropivny and Skorokhod<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> extended the work of Gleiter by developing a system of numbering and coding of nanomaterials considering both external dimensions as a whole (k) and dimensionality of each individual constituent unit (l, m, n, …) in a typical kDlmn… designation. In addition, they tabulated 36 main classes of possible nanostructures and described their expected properties. Recently, two technical committees of ISO/TC 229 and IEC/TC 113 have been collaborating to develop a series of standards under the general title of ISO/TS 80004 Nanotechnology—vocabulary in order to unify the nanotechnology related vocabularies and terminology. According to this standard, the length range of 1 nm to 100 nm is called the nanoscale and a material with any external or internal dimension or surface structure at the nanoscale is called a nanomaterial. Nanomaterials are then classified into two main categories of (i) nano-objects, with at least one external dimension at the nanoscale and (ii) nanostructured materials, with external dimensions typically larger than the nanoscale but internal structures at the nanoscale. A nano-object itself is divided into three main categories of (i) nanoparticles, with all external dimensions at the nanoscale, (ii) nanofibres, with at least two external dimensions at the nanoscale and another dimension significantly (more than 3 times) larger than the other two, and (iii) nanoplates, with at least one dimension at the nanoscale and another two dimensions significantly larger.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Various nanoparticles of G6-TMDs have been synthesized, such as quantum dots, fullerenes, hollow polyhedral closed-cage structures and nanooctahedra (top-left panel in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>). According to ISO/TS 80004-2, a nanoparticle is referred to any nanomaterial with all three external dimensions below 100 nm. While nanoparticles fully realize benefits of spatial nano-sized dimensions and nano-size effects, such as high surface to volume ratio and size-dependent properties, they do not necessarily exploit remarkable quantum phenomena that require much more shrinkage in size. Quantum phenomena, including quantization of the energy spectrum and electron density of states as well as a substantial increase in bandgap and light absorption/emission, introduce another methodology for the classification of nanomaterials, which is the subject of ISO/TS 80004-12.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Based on the standard definition, nanomaterials are classified into quantum wells (0D), quantum wires (1D) and quantum dots (2D) depending on their spatial quantum confinement in one, two and three dimensions, respectively. In particular, a quantum dot is defined as a nanoparticle in which all three dimensions are smaller than twice the exciton Bohr radius of the bulk material (the most probable distance between the excited electron–hole pair in a semiconductor).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74,75</span></sup></a> Since the exciton Bohr radii of G6-TMDs are in the range of 1–2 nm,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76–79</span></sup></a> nanoparticles with average diameter below 5 nm are quantum dots of G6-TMDs. In the special case of monolayer G6-TMDs, three-dimensional quantum confinement has been reported up to the lateral dimension of ∼10 nm and thus these monolayer nanosheets can also be considered as quantum dots.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80,81</span></sup></a> Nonetheless, further fundamental research and quantification of both nano-size effects and quantum-size effects in G6-TMDs for a more accurate classification are worthwhile and desirable.

      <p class="otherpara">Nanofibre is the generic name assigned to any nanomaterial with two external dimensions at the nanoscale and another dimension at least three times larger (ISO/TS 80004-2). Various G6-TMD nanofibres have been synthesized so far (top-right panel in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>). G6-TMD nanotubes, which are hollow nanofibres, may be the most common nanofibres in this class. Both single-walled and multi-walled nanotubes of G6-TMDs have been synthesized and the subject is well summarized by the reviews of Tenne <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84</span></sup></a> and Rao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> Moreover, various G6-TMD nanorods (solid nanofibres according to the standard definition, when solidity does matter) and G6-TMD nanowires (electrically conductive nanofibres according to the standard definition, when conductivity is of the essence) have also been synthesized.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Nanoplate is another important class of G6-TMD nanomaterials which has one external dimension at the nanoscale with another two dimensions at least three times larger (ISO/TS 80004-2). Various nanoplates of G6-TMDs such as nanosheets, nanoribbons and nanobelts have been synthesized (bottom-right panel in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>). Nanoplates, due to their inherent 2D nature, benefit from both nano-size effects in one dimension and good capability to be integrated into device architectures because of their two other larger dimensions and thus are of great technological interest and importance. The variety of available low-cost and facile production methods for G6-TMD nanoplates along with their remarkable physical/chemical properties make them the most attractive category of nanomaterials among the others. Notably, nanosheets of G6-TMDs, following the great success of graphene, have been the subject of intense research in recent years. However, a standard definition of G6-TMD nanosheets is still lacking. Due to the layered nature of G6-TMDs, nanosheets of these materials typically consist of a few molecular layers stacked in parallel which clearly distinguish them from thin films with random orientation of crystallite regions. A nanosheet of a single molecular layer of G6-TMDs is called a monolayer nanosheet. It consists of a single atomic layer of a group 6 transition metal sandwiched between two atomic layers of chalcogen (see the next section for a complete discussion). Accordingly, nanosheets of several molecular layers are called fewlayer nanosheets. However, there is no universal agreement on the definition of fewlayer nanosheets, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the maximum number of layers of a nanosheet below which the nanosheet can be regarded fewlayer. In the case of graphene nanosheets, the difference between the electronic band structure of graphene and bulk graphite is larger than 10% up to 10 layers, but for ≥11 layers their electronic band structures become almost identical<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> and thus it is advised that the latter be called graphite thin films rather than graphene.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> Following the criterion of at least 10% difference with the bulk form in electronic band structures (especially the bandgaps) and since above 5 layers the bandgaps of all G6-TMDs approach the bulk values,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> it is suggested that G6-TMDs with ≤5 layers be called fewlayer nanosheets and thicker nanosheets be considered as multilayer nanosheets. It should be noted that the above conclusion is based on early theoretical works reported in the literature and therefore independent experimental assessments along with more accurate and up to date theoretical works would be of great interest for a more precise definition of fewlayer and multilayer nanosheets.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Lastly, G6-TMD nanomaterials with all three external dimensions above 100 nm but with internal structure at the nanoscale are classified as nanostructures. Bottom-left panel of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a> shows various possible nanostructures of G6-TMDs such as nanoflowers, urchin-like structures, core–shell and hollow microboxes, self-assembled nanorings and mesoporous structures. Strictly speaking some of the other heterostructures, such as hybrid 0D and 1D nanobuds or vertically stacked 2D nanosheets, may be included in this category; however, according to ISO/TS 80004-2 (nano-objects) and ISO/TS 80004-4 (nanostructured materials), when any external dimension of a nanostructure is at the nanoscale, it is recommended to be considered as a nano-object. 3D nanostructures of G6-TMDs have great potential and promise in many advanced technological fields, most notably catalysis and energy.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">The monolayer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> has unique electrical, mechanical, magnetic and optical properties which distinguish it from its bulk counterpart. While bulk MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is a diamagnetic semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.29 eV, 1H-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is a diamagnetic semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.90 eV and 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is a paramagnetic semimetal at all.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8,123</span></sup></a> The metallic or semiconducting behaviour of monolayer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be explained by a simple energy level model based on the ligand field theory.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> In MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> the metal cation is surrounded by six chalcogen anions with Mo(S)<small><sub>6</sub></small> molecular geometry. Ligand field splitting of metal d orbitals determines the electronic properties of the compound. Mo ([Kr]4d<small><sup>5</sup></small>5s<small><sup>1</sup></small>) supplies four of its six valence shell electrons to bonding states primarily composed of S 3p orbitals. The two other electrons enter into states made by splitting of Mo 4d orbitals. As depicted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5a</a>, molybdenum atoms in the 1T crystal are in octahedral coordination (<span class="italic">D</span><small><sub>3d</sub></small>) which results in splitting of 4d orbitals of Mo into a lower triply degenerate band (t<small><sub>2g</sub></small>) and an upper doubly degenerate band (e<small><sub>g</sub></small>). The incomplete occupation of three t<small><sub>2g</sub></small> orbitals by two electrons is responsible for the metallic behaviour of 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>. In contrast, the molybdenum atom coordination in 1H-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is trigonal prismatic (<span class="italic">D</span><small><sub>3h</sub></small>) with ligand field induced splitting of Mo 4d orbitals in one non-degenerate orbital (a<small><sub>1</sub></small>) at the lowest energy level followed by two doubly degenerate orbitals (e and e′), as <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5b</a> shows. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), consisting mainly of Mo d<small><sub><span class="italic">z</span><small><sup>2</sup></small></sub></small> orbitals, is filled with two paired electrons and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), consisting mainly of Mo d<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>−<span class="italic">y</span><small><sup>2</sup></small></sub></small> and d<small><sub><span class="italic">xy</span></sub></small>, is situated 1.9 eV above the HOMO. Therefore, there is a band gap of 1.9 eV in 1H-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> which confirms its semiconducting behaviour.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">It is worth noting that 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is a metastable phase and transforms into the 1H phase by aging within two months under air conditions<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159</span></sup></a> or upon annealing in Ar at 300 °C within an hour.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159,160</span></sup></a> However, stabilization of the 1T phase by doping with rhenium<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> and vanadium<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> has been reported.

      <p class="otherpara">First, lattice constants increase upon going from sulfides to tellurides in both MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> crystals. The <span class="italic">z</span>-parameter also slightly decreases from sulfides to tellurides indicating a smaller van der Waals gap between the monolayers in the bulk unit cell, or in the other words, thicker monolayer in the series from MS<small><sub>2</sub></small> to MTe<small><sub>2</sub></small> with respect to the <span class="italic">c</span> lattice constant.

      <p class="otherpara">Another important trend in G6-TMDs that deserves a special discussion is the change in bandgaps. Various energy gaps and electronic properties in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, such as optical gap (<span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>opt</sub></small>), electronic bandgap (<span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>g</sub></small>) and band splittings, are schematically illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">140,167</span></sup></a> All G6-TMDs with a hexagonal (2H<small><sub>c</sub></small>) crystal structure are indirect bandgap semiconductors in the bulk form. The bulk bandgap is decreased from sulfides to tellurides in harmony with the increasing metallic character of chalcogens from sulfur to tellurium. By decreasing the number of layers in the crystal of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the bandgap starts to increase from about 5-layer nanosheets. In the limit of monolayer, in addition to the bandgap widening, an abrupt change from an indirect to a direct bandgap also occurs.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8,168</span></sup></a> To explain this transition from a smaller indirect bandgap of bulk MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> into a larger direct bandgap of monolayer 1H-MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> a more sophisticated model than the energy level model is needed.

Comparing <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6f-i</a> with <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6f-ii</a>, it can be seen that by removing a single S atom from the top layer of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the sulfur vacancy defect (V<small><sub>S</sub></small>) is identified by a dimmer sulfur spot and then by removing the other S atom from the bottom layer, the vacancy of two columnar sulfur atoms (V<small><sub>S2</sub></small>) becomes marked by the disappearance of the corresponding sulfur spot in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6f-iii</a>.

      <span>Characterization of produced nanomaterials is an essential step during their fabrication and before using them in any application. In this section various characterization methods of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanomaterials are discussed at both fundamental and practical levels. We have adopted this unified treatment of main characterization methods in a dedicated section to avoid discontinuity through dispersion of such specialized materials in the remainder of the text.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for lateral size measurement, atomic force microscopy (AFM) for thickness and lateral size measurement, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) for atomic-resolution imaging, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) for thickness, lateral size, phase composition and structural defect determination are straightforward and easy to interpret microscopy techniques which are routinely used to characterize nanomaterials. In addition, optical microscopy, as an easy yet powerful method, is an important characterization method of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets which has a special place among the microscopy techniques. Because of the versatility of optical microscopy and its ability to quickly identify nanosheets together with its historical impact on discovery of graphene<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> and subsequently many other 2D materials including MX<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> a brief discussion about optical microscopy is presented in Section 4.1. Apart from direct imaging methods, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy for monolayer nanosheet identification and corresponding optical bandgap determination and Raman spectroscopy for probing the structure and thickness of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets are very common and useful. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 discuss PL and Raman methods in detail, respectively, and give some necessary remarks on their usage for characterization of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanomaterials. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry is also a versatile technique for the investigation of the optoelectronic properties of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets, especially as a concentration-probe when they are dispersed in solvents, and since its underlying physical mechanism has similarities with PL spectroscopy, it will be covered in Section 4.2.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Phase identification and crystalline quality assessment of G6-TMD nanomaterials are usually performed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Bulk hexagonal (2H) and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes of G6-TMDs have well-known and well documented XRD patterns and thus XRD can be used to distinguish between these polytypes and to determine the phase composition of their samples. JCPDS card numbers and 2<span class="italic">θ</span> peak positions of three (002), (100) and (110) characteristic peaks of hexagonal (2H) G6-TMDs are summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. In general, the (002) peak, corresponding to the reflection from a set of atomic planes parallel to the basal plane of 2H-MX<small><sub>2</sub></small>, is the most intense peak in the XRD pattern of the bulk crystalline form. However, in fewlayer nanosheets (002) reflection becomes weaker and in the monolayer limit it disappears.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233</span></sup></a> In the case of monolayer nanosheets, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of completely separated monolayers does not exhibit (110) reflection too, but in-plane (100) reflection would still be observable.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> The presence of (110) reflection in a sample of monolayer nanosheets is the sign of loose agglomeration while the appearance of (002) reflection indicates strong aggregation.</p>

Various information regarding chemical composition, chemical state of constituent elements and their stoichiometric ratio can be obtained from XPS analysis. XPS is a surface analytical technique and the elemental composition determined by XPS is acquired from a depth of 1–10 nm (first few atomic layers of the sample surface) and is nearly ideal for analysis of fewlayer nanosheets compared with the above 1 μm probing depth of energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS or EDX) spectroscopy, usually accompanied by the SEM and TEM, which is greatly influenced by the underlying substrate for ultra-thin films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit235"><sup><span class="sup_ref">235</span></sup></a> In 2H-MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> compounds, Mo 3d<small><sub>5/2</sub></small> and Mo 3d<small><sub>3/2</sub></small> states at binding energies about ∼229 eV and ∼232 eV, respectively (the accurate value depends on the chalcogen element, X) will upshift in energy by ∼3 eV upon partial oxidation of MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> whereas downshift in energy by ∼1 eV upon transformation into metallic 1T-MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192,233,236–238</span></sup></a> Similar behaviour has also been reported for W 4f<small><sub>7/2</sub></small> (∼33 eV) and W 4f<small><sub>5/2</sub></small> (∼35 eV) states in WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> compounds.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239–242</span></sup></a> The increase in the measured binding energies upon oxidation of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be explained by the change of oxidation state of metal from M<small><sup>4+</sup></small> in MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> into a higher oxidation state of M<small><sup>6+</sup></small> in MO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and thus increase in the bond strength between the metal and chalcogen atoms.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233,237,240,241</span></sup></a> The decrease in the binding energies upon transformation from semiconducting 2H-MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> polytype into metallic 1T-MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> polytype is also attributed to the change of metal coordination from trigonal prismatic to octahedral crystal structure.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192,238,239</span></sup></a> XPS is also effectively used to obtain the accurate stoichiometric ratio of metal to chalcogen in MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> compounds, which may be different from the nominal 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>2 ratio, particularly in samples synthesized by bottom-up methods, such as wet chemical and chemical vapour deposition.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">149,243</span></sup></a> Moreover, XPS can provide valuable qualitative and quantitative information about defects, edge states and vacancies in produced G6-TMD nanomaterials.</p>

        <span>Monolayer and fewlayer MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets with large enough lateral dimensions (above 1 micrometre) can be seen under an optical microscope if placed on a SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si substrate with a carefully optimized oxide layer thickness (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7a and b</a>). <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7c</a> shows a schematic of multiple optical transmission and reflection paths involved in this phenomenon. MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets, despite their atomic thickness, absorb an appreciable portion of incident light (a few percent per each monolayer) and microscopy in the reflection mode provides an enhanced contrast since the light passes through the nanosheets twice (compared with the transmission mode) before reaching the eye of the observer. Considering, for example, the complex refractive indexes of bulk and monolayer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7d</a>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit255"><sup><span class="sup_ref">255</span></sup></a> affirms that G6-TMDs have a significant extinction coefficient (imaginary part of the refractive index, <span class="italic">k</span>) over a large portion of the visible light spectrum even in the monolayer limit. The imaginary part is responsible for attenuation of light passing through nanosheets while the real part changes the phase velocity of the transmitted light. However, this absorption of light becomes detectable only if nanosheets are observed in a high contrast background with an appropriate (not so high) illumination, similar to the visibility of stars in the night sky. This backlight adjustment is achieved by selecting a proper SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> thickness which acts like a mirror at the rear faces of nanosheets and provides a feeble interference-induced backlight.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> Taking into account complex refractive indexes of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and Si, the intensity of reflected light from a sample in the geometry shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7c</a> can be calculated and the contrast of a nanosheet on the SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si substrate can be determined. The contrast is defined as the relative intensity of reflected light from MX<small><sub>2</sub></small>/SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si compared to the bare substrate, SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7e</a> shows a reference plot for MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> to select an appropriate illumination wavelength (colour filter) for any given SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> thickness which is theoretically calculated using the Fresnel law.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a> Positive contrast values mean the MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> layer appears darker than the substrate while negative values indicate brighter appearance.

In SHG two photons of the same energy (produced by a laser) are absorbed by an electron to excite it to a virtual state. Then, upon relaxation the excited electron goes back into its ground state and emits a photon with exactly half the wavelength of the incident photons (frequency and energy doubled).

        <p class="otherpara">Overall, the PL characteristics of G6-TMDs are influenced by several factors, including substrates,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit286"><sup><span class="sup_ref">286,287</span></sup></a> solvents,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit288"><sup><span class="sup_ref">288</span></sup></a> strain,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit289"><sup><span class="sup_ref">289</span></sup></a> laser excitation intensity,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit290"><sup><span class="sup_ref">290,291</span></sup></a> defects,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">189,195,292</span></sup></a> molecular physisorption,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit293"><sup><span class="sup_ref">293</span></sup></a> chemical doping,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit294"><sup><span class="sup_ref">294,295</span></sup></a> alloying<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit296"><sup><span class="sup_ref">296</span></sup></a> and heterostructuring.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297,298</span></sup></a> Of particular interest is the temperature dependent PL spectra of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> which exhibit a striking difference between MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers. Generally, the two direct excitonic peaks, A and B, in MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> PL spectra imply the spin-splitting of the valence band with the difference providing a measure of this splitting (about ∼200 meV for MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> and ∼400 meV for WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers, according to <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). On the other hand, the conduction band of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets is also split by spin–orbit coupling and though it is an order of magnitude smaller than the valence band splitting, it has a great impact on the temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> While the PL and EL intensities of MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers decrease by increasing the temperature, the PL and EL intensities of WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers increase by increasing the temperature. For example, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8d</a>, the EL intensity of MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers falls by about 10 times when the temperature is increased from 6 K to 300 K, whereas WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers exhibit about 200 times increase in the EL intensity in this temperature range.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> The increase in photoluminescence of WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers is also remarkable (about 10 times) going from 6 K to 300 K, very promising for light emitting quantum wells and other optoelectronic devices.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> The origin of this behaviour can be explained by considering the electronic band structure of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8a</a>. Since the conduction band splitting of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> compounds is small and comparable to <span class="italic">k</span><small><sub>B</sub></small><span class="italic">T</span> energy at room temperature (∼26 meV), the temperature has a strong influence on how excited electrons accumulate in the two adjacent spin–orbit induced states in the conduction band at the <span class="italic">K</span> point. At low temperatures, the exciton population in MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers tends to accumulate in the lowest energy exciton sub-band which is bright in MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers and has strong EL and PL, while it is dark (decays through nonradiative recombination) in WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers. In contrast, at room temperature there is enough energy for excited electrons and holes to accumulate in the second lowest energy exciton sub-band which is dark in MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers while it is bright in WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers. The external quantum efficiency of light emitting quantum wells fabricated from monolayers of WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> sandwiched between h-BN (hexagonal boron nitride) fewlayer nanosheets and graphene electrodes was reported to be 5% at room temperature more than 250 times higher than devices fabricated by MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> or MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">There are two other noticeable trends in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8d</a>, which deserve further discussion. First, by increasing the temperature, in both MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers, the EL peaks shift to lower energies, a fact that is also observed for PL peaks.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">151,190,300</span></sup></a> This shift can be understood in terms of change in the in-plane lattice constant, <span class="italic">a</span>, by temperature variation.

These shifts can be described by Varshni's semi-empirical equation, the relationship between the bandgap and temperature of common semiconductors.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79,300</span></sup></a> Another trend in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8d</a> is peak broadening by increasing the temperature for both MoX<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WX<small><sub>2</sub></small> which is attributed to increased scattering of excitons by optical phonons at higher temperatures.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Peak A, the main PL peak of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets, is a superposition of a neutral exciton (A<small><sup>0</sup></small>) and a negative trion (A<small><sup>−</sup></small>). The binding energy of an exciton (an electron electrostatically bonded to a hole, see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8e</a>) in MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers is on the order of ∼600 meV, whereas a negative trion (two electrons electrostatically bonded to a hole, see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8e</a>) has an excess binding energy of ∼20 meV with respect to an exciton and thus A<small><sup>−</sup></small> is redshifted compared to A<small><sup>0</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> The proportional share of excitons and trions in peak A of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets strongly depends on the substrate or the solvent of nanosheets.

      <span>This section provides a systematic classification of all existing production methods of various group 6 transition metal dichalcogenide nanomaterials with a detailed description and discussion of each method from an application-oriented point of view. Production methods are first categorized into top-down and bottom-up approaches. Then, top-down methods are divided into four main subcategories of 5.1. Mechanical cleavage, 5.2. Liquid phase exfoliation, 5.3. Intercalation and exfoliation, and 5.4. Thinning. Bottom-up methods are also divided into two main subcategories including 5.5. Vapour deposition and 5.6. Solution-based synthesis. Finally, these six main subcategories are further segmented into 13 distinct types of production methods as presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10</a>.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">Discussion of each production method starts with a clear, readily understandable and step-by-step explanation of its procedure for a wide interdisciplinary audience. The pertinent chemical reactions, the physical mechanisms involved in the process and the governing equations as well as starting materials, necessary equipment and safety concerns are then discussed in detail. With the aid of original schematics and charts together with carefully collected and arranged figures and tables, the effects of various general processing parameters such as temperature, pressure and time, along with individual parameters of each production method on the quality and quantity of produced nanosheets are described. While our emphasis is on 2D nanosheets, we also review and discuss the capability of producing other nanomaterials such as 0D quantum dots, 1D nanoribbons and 3D nanoflowers, for each specific production method. The major criteria in utilizing the production method for technological applications, including thickness, lateral size, production rate and crystalline quality of produced nanosheets, are subsequently analysed and summarized. In addition, challenges and practical issues related to each production method are addressed and remarks on its advantages and disadvantages are provided. Finally, the devoted subsection to each production method is culminated by outlining potential future research directions to improve that method.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">It should be emphasized that the presented classification here reflects our application-oriented perspective and is just one of several possible classifications for existing production methods of G6-TMD nanomaterials. Some of these production methods can be further divided into two or three methods and each of them has the potential to be considered as an independent production method. For instance, metal–organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), epitaxial growth and atomic layer deposition (ALD) are all considered here as subcategories of the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method; however, they could be treated separately in dedicated sections. On the other hand, some authors have preferred to include thermal decomposition as a subcategory of CVD,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32,41</span></sup></a> while we consider it as an outstanding production method and place it under the solution-based synthesis branch. We also consider laser thinning and thermal annealing as sub-categories of the sublimation production method, and sputter deposition, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and thermal evaporation deposition as subcategories of the physical vapour deposition (PVD) method. Nevertheless, we believe that our particular classification provides a cognitive framework to discuss all existing production methods of G6-TMDs in a balanced way with a unified approach avoiding confusion that might arise from a long and indiscriminate list of methods. Furthermore, this classification can effectively help outline the future research directions that should be explored to improve existing production methods or develop new methods, either from scratch or by combining different production methods into one method that benefits from their advantages and eliminates the weak points of each individual method.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">In <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11</a> the main steps of the method are illustrated. Starting from a single crystal with a flat surface of about 1 × 1 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>, the standard thinning procedure involves successively peeling layers of the crystal using an ordinary adhesive tape (for example 3M Scotch® tape). First, some initial cleavage steps are performed to achieve a fresh surface of the MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> crystal and then this fresh basal plane is placed on the sticky side of a piece of tape. By peeling off the tape a layer of about 1 μm in thickness is separated from the crystal. Then another piece of tape is placed on the other side of the separated layer to form a sandwich made of tape/MX<small><sub>2</sub></small>/tape. By pulling the two pieces of tape apart the layer splits into two thinner layers of the same surface area. This process is usually performed by repeated folding and unfolding of the tape, until the layers adhered to the tape at its surface become barely visible to the naked eye. The next step consists of sticking the tape to a silicon substrate covered with usually 90 or 285 nm thick SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and applying a light rubbing with a soft object such as a dry sponge.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit258"><sup><span class="sup_ref">258,259,340</span></sup></a> Finally, peeling off the adhesive tape leaves behind flakes of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> on the substrate.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">However, most good solvents of G6-TMDs, such as CHP, NMP and DMF, have high boiling points which become problematic when the fast removal of solvent is required for example in thin film deposition, inkjet printing or fabrication of polymer composites. Besides, solvents such as NMP and DMF are toxic and cause environmental issues. In addition, some applications such as biomedical diagnosis need biocompatible dispersions which urge the use of aqueous solutions. But, since G6-TMD nanosheets are hydrophobic in nature<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit373"><sup><span class="sup_ref">373</span></sup></a> even after exfoliation in water (for example with long time sonication) they tend to aggregate, unless a surfactant is used. Thus another strategy in the sonication and exfoliation method is to first select a solvent depending on the application and then use surfactants to promote exfoliation and stabilization of nanosheets in the selected solvent. For sonication and exfoliation of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> in water or low boiling point solvents, a variety of ionic surfactants<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit366"><sup><span class="sup_ref">366,374</span></sup></a> and nonionic surfactants<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit366"><sup><span class="sup_ref">366,368</span></sup></a> as well as polymers<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66,375,376</span></sup></a> have been used in the literature. The stabilization mechanism of dispersion is electrostatic repulsion for ionic surfactants and steric repulsion (space constraints) for nonionic surfactants or polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit357"><sup><span class="sup_ref">357,374</span></sup></a> Smith <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit366"><sup><span class="sup_ref">366</span></sup></a> studied the dispersibility of various inorganic layered compounds, including MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MoTe<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, in a number of ionic and nonionic aqueous surfactant solutions and found that under the same synthesis conditions the final concentration of stabilized nanosheets varies from 0.06 to 0.09 mg ml<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the range of surfactants used (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14d</a>). Sonication and exfoliation assisted by non-conventional surfactants, such as DNA/RNA nucleotides,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit377"><sup><span class="sup_ref">377</span></sup></a> bovine serum albumin protein<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit378"><sup><span class="sup_ref">378</span></sup></a> and gelatin,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit379"><sup><span class="sup_ref">379</span></sup></a> have also been reported. Gupta <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit374"><sup><span class="sup_ref">374</span></sup></a> measured the zeta potential of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> surfactant stabilized dispersions with two representative cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) and anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) surfactants and concluded that surfactant chains lie randomly on basal planes of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets while surfactant charged headgroups control the effective charge of nanosheets. Thus, cationic surfactants give positively charged nanosheets in the dispersion and anionic surfactants result in negatively charged nanosheets. It is worth noting that usually G6-TMD nanosheets dispersed in organic solvents or aqueous media without surfactants are negatively charged due to rather large electron affinity of sulfur atoms.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273,380</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Final concentration of dispersed and stabilized nanosheets in a solvent is an important parameter in the sonication and exfoliation method. Final concentration is typically in the range of 0.01 to 10 mg ml<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and depends on the type of solvent (or surfactant for aqueous media), power of sonication, sonication time, initial concentration of the bulk powder, initial concentration of the surfactant (for aqueous media), centrifugation rate and centrifugation time.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit283"><sup><span class="sup_ref">283,366</span></sup></a> As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14e</a>, final concentration is monotonically increased by increasing the sonication power. Final concentration also scales with the square root of sonication time and increases by increasing the sonication time. Increasing the initial concentration of the bulk powder or the surfactant also increases the final concentration; however, there is an upper limit for these initial concentrations above which the final concentration does not increase or even decreases. Moreover, the final concentration exhibits an inverse correlation with centrifugation rate and time as a result of nanosheet sedimentation during centrifugation. Though the above discussion and trends generally hold for both organic solvents and aqueous media subjected to probe or bath sonication, there are other subsidiary effects and phenomena that may influence the specific behavior of each case. For example, Qiao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit381"><sup><span class="sup_ref">381</span></sup></a> investigated the effect of sonication power on the concentration of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> dispersions in NMP using a probe sonicator and found that the optimal range is from 200 W to 320 W for 20 ml solvent.

          <p class="otherpara">The Ajayan group conducted a series of systematic experiments on solvent mixtures and extended the library of solvents for liquid phase exfoliation by introducing several low-toxic and low-cost cosolvent systems with low boiling points, such as IPA/water, THF/water and acetone/water.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit282"><sup><span class="sup_ref">282,417</span></sup></a> They determined the optimum volume ratio of solvent mixtures through a direct probing and matching procedure based on the surface tension. In general, a good solvent should have a similar surface tension to the solute which leads to a minimized solvent–solute interfacial surface tension that can be probed for example by contact angle measurements. Good solvents of G6-TMDs, as shown schematically in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16b</a>, exhibit lower contact angles with bulk G6-TMD films, in comparison with poor solvents. A lower contact angle is indicative of better wettability of G6-TMDs in the solvent and also minimized interfacial surface tension between the solvent and G6-TMDs. The total surface tension (<span class="italic">σ</span>) is composed of two components, dispersive (<span class="italic">σ</span><small><sup>d</sup></small>) and polar (<span class="italic">σ</span><small><sup>p</sup></small>) surface tensions. Based on this concept, Ajayan and coworkers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit282"><sup><span class="sup_ref">282</span></sup></a> proposed an alternative framework that relies on matching of surface tension components between nanosheets and solvents to replace the Hansen solubility parameters. In this new framework, to search for good solvents, first the ratio of polar to dispersive components of the solute and solvent should be matched or, in other words, (<span class="italic">σ</span><small><sup>p</sup></small>/<span class="italic">σ</span><small><sup>d</sup></small>) of the 2D material and that of the solvent should be as close as possible.

          <p class="otherpara">Although solubility parameters, such as the Hansen solubility parameters and surface tension, provide a quantitative means to select between different solvents based on minimization of the energy needed for dispersion, it is not always the case. For example, experiments show that dry (anhydrous) NMP has several times lower solubility than NMP with water content, whereas water/NMP cosolvent system exhibits worse solubility parameters matching with G6-TMDs than dry NMP (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16e</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit284"><sup><span class="sup_ref">284,418,419</span></sup></a> Jawaid <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit284"><sup><span class="sup_ref">284</span></sup></a> proposed an exfoliation mechanism based on autoxidation of NMP to NMS (<span class="italic">N</span>-methyl-succinimide) during sonication in the presence of dissolved O<small><sub>2</sub></small> (g) and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O in NMP and formation of intermediate redox active species, such as hydroperoxide (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16f</a>). They attributed exfoliation of the bulk MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> crystal to oxidation of edge sites by hydroperoxide intermediates and accordingly negative charge accumulation at the edges, which causes Coulombic repulsion between individual layers and eventually overcomes van der Waals forces holding the crystal. To further confirm the proposed mechanism, they exfoliated MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> in NMP without sonication by just adding a small amount of water and NMS into the solution and then heating the mixture to 100 °C for 1 h with stirring to promote peroxidation of NMP. This redox-based viewpoint to the liquid phase exfoliation mechanism is in agreement with other reports of spontaneous exfoliation of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> in a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>/NMP mixture.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit194"><sup><span class="sup_ref">194</span></sup></a> Recently, Jawaid <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit420"><sup><span class="sup_ref">420</span></sup></a> have taken another step forward and reported exfoliation of various layered transition metal dichalcogenides, including G6-TMDs, by two-step oxidation and reduction reactions under mild and quiescent conditions without the need for any vigorous mechanical treatment, such as sonication (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16g</a>). This redox based methodology resulted in dispersions of G6-TMDs in common solvents, such as ethanol, acetone and acetonitrile, with high concentrations (&gt;1 mg ml<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). Furthermore, exfoliated fewlayer nanosheets had lateral sizes of hundreds of nanometers and exhibit a very narrow distribution of thicknesses.

Accordingly, Gupta <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit418"><sup><span class="sup_ref">418</span></sup></a> attributed the higher concentration of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets in water/NMP dispersions to the adsorption of water molecules onto Mo-edges of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets and consequently a more effective interaction between the NMP solvent and nanosheets due to hydrogen bonding between localized H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O molecules at the edges of nanosheets and NMP molecules. They also proposed that H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O adsorption at the edges of nanosheets could also have a protective role, since in their experiments, MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets exfoliated in water/NMP had larger lateral size compared with nanosheets exfoliated in dry NMP.</p>

        <span>The thinning category in production methods of G6-TMD MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets consists of all methods that deal with layer-by-layer peeling of multi or fewlayer MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> in a controlled manner. This method can be divided into three main subcategories, namely sublimation with heat as the driving force, plasma treatment with an external electric field as the driving force and etching with highly oxidizing reagents. The sublimation itself may be local as is the case in laser thinning or global as is the case in thermal annealing.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The thinning method usually starts with the isolation of a fewlayer MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> flake from a bulk MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> crystal by mechanical cleavage followed by successive thinning to the desired thickness.

The main drawback of the laser thinning method is its limitation to yield only monolayer and not fewlayer nanosheets.

          <p class="otherpara">The role of substrate type in the CVD growth of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> is also widely investigated. Amorphous SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si, as the most common substrate, leads to the growth of non-uniform and randomly oriented MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> islands and thus highly disordered grain boundaries are present in the resulting film.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251,533,548</span></sup></a> So far, the largest single-crystal domain of CVD-grown monolayer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> on SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si has been reported by van der Zande <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a> who achieved equilateral triangles with 120 μm edge length by fine tuning of CVD parameters and careful cleaning of the substrate. The large concentration of grain boundaries leads to poor electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, therefore controlling the crystallographic orientation of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> islands during the growth to obtain a large-area continuous uniform crystalline film is highly desirable. Accordingly, single crystal substrates, such as sapphire,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">149,251,549,580</span></sup></a> mica,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit537"><sup><span class="sup_ref">537</span></sup></a> GaN<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit576"><sup><span class="sup_ref">576</span></sup></a> and SrTiO<small><sub>3</sub></small><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit577"><sup><span class="sup_ref">577,581,582</span></sup></a> as well as graphene,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit571"><sup><span class="sup_ref">571,583</span></sup></a> h-BN<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit584"><sup><span class="sup_ref">584</span></sup></a> and Au,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit574"><sup><span class="sup_ref">574,575,585,586</span></sup></a> have been used to grow MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> films. In comparison with SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si, these substrates offer a more atomically flat surface in conjunction with better lattice matching and more effective interaction with MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> adlayers, thus generally yielding films of higher uniformity, continuity and crystallinity. Mica and GaN are especially important for their susceptibility to epitaxial growth of MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> layers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit537"><sup><span class="sup_ref">537,576</span></sup></a> Single crystal SrTiO<small><sub>3</sub></small> is also an interesting substrate which provides fractal growth and results in dendritic MX<small><sub>2</sub></small> flakes with abundant edge sites, intriguing for catalytic applications.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit577"><sup><span class="sup_ref">577,582</span></sup></a></p>

They concluded that fluorinated copper phthalocyanine (F<small><sub>16</sub></small>CuPc) and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid tetrapotassium salt (PTAS) were the most suitable seeding promoters for the growth of large area and high-quality monolayers.

By incorporating these dopants, they activated sulfur edges of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> layers and achieved a two-fold increase in catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Robinson and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit516"><sup><span class="sup_ref">516</span></sup></a> also demonstrated manganese (Mn) doping of monolayer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> by placing Mn<small><sub>2</sub></small>(CO)<small><sub>10</sub></small> powder at the upstream of a tube furnace before sulfur and MoO<small><sub>3</sub></small> powders.

They placed S powder at the upstream, MoO<small><sub>3</sub></small> powder in front of a SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si substrate and scattered W powder on the substrate with Ar as the carrier gas. With this arrangement, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21b and c</a>, at high growth temperatures around ∼850 °C vertical heterostructures of WS<small><sub>2</sub></small> on MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> were energetically favourable and thus WS<small><sub>2</sub></small>/MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> bilayers were formed. On the other hand, at lower temperatures (∼650 °C) lateral epitaxial growth of WS<small><sub>2</sub></small> on edges of as-grown triangular MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> domains was dominant and monolayer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>-WS<small><sub>2</sub></small> heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces were grown. Another important step was taken by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit528"><sup><span class="sup_ref">528</span></sup></a> who fabricated monolayer WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>–MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> heterojunctions in a sequential CVD process towards a true G6-TMD lateral p–n junction.

Generally, heterostructures can be characterized by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping. In addition, in-plane heterostructures, which are difficult to identify with optical microscopy and AFM techniques, can be conveniently characterized with Raman and PL mapping (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21d</a>).

In this context, growth of triangular and hexagonal domains, dendritic flakes and epitaxial film growth up to the wafer-scale on appropriate substrates were particularly emphasized.

As stated before in Section 5.4, van der Waals bonding between the layers in G6-TMDs is weaker in comparison with graphite.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit146"><sup><span class="sup_ref">146,480,484</span></sup></a> Therefore, the usage of physical production methods, such as PVD and thinning, for production of G6-TMD nanosheets is practical and attractive despite the fact that these methods have not been common and convenient for production of graphene. In a typical PVD process, first the bulk material is vaporized either by the bombardment with energetic ions (sputter deposition) or localized heating in a high vacuum with laser pulses (pulsed laser deposition) or heating in a furnace (thermal evaporation deposition), and then is physically deposited and condensed on a substrate to form a thin layer.</span>

          <span>The wet chemical synthesis method refers to those bottom-up routes that involve chemical reactions in the liquid phase (aqueous or non-aqueous) at elevated temperatures (and often high pressures) to increase the reaction rate and is especially appropriate for high-yield mass production of a variety of nanomaterials. Its mechanism based on the nucleation in liquid medium and growth to the desired shape is fundamentally different from the diffusion mechanism of dry synthesis methods, such as CVD and PVD.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit648"><sup><span class="sup_ref">648</span></sup></a> The wet chemical synthesis of G6-TMD nanomaterials can be divided into three categories of hydrothermal, solvothermal and colloidal synthesis routes. Chemical reactions in hydrothermal synthesis are carried out in an aqueous solution above the boiling point of water whereas the reaction medium of solvothermal synthesis is a non-aqueous solution, usually a high boiling point organic solvent. Hydrothermal and solvothermal synthesis methods, hydro/solvothermal in short, are very similar to each other with respect to precursors and involved chemical reactions and both are performed in a sealed high pressure container, popularly called an autoclave (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23a</a>). Colloidal synthesis, on the other hand, is generally accomplished in a three-neck round bottom flask under an inert atmosphere (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23b</a>). The wet chemistry is very rich in nanomaterials that can be synthesized and in addition to nanosheets, a variety of other morphologies, such as nanoflowers, microboxes, planar heterostructures, core-shells and nanocomposites can be produced by this method (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23c</a>).</span>

      <h2 id="sect5819"><span class="a_heading">6. Production-application selection guide</span></h2>
      <span>This section is a totally new contribution to the research field of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenide nanomaterials and presents a production-application selection guide in order to provide insight into the fundamental question of “which production method is suitable for which application?”. For many existing applications of G6-TMDs, various methods are available for producing desired nanomaterials, while customarily only one or two specific methods are employed by the experts in each application area. In the case of emerging new applications, such as photoelectrochemical water splitting, there is no routine and widely accepted production method and sometimes researchers adopt a less efficient production method or even an inappropriate method. Moreover, some of the production methods such as thermal annealing, etching, sputter deposition and pulsed laser deposition are often overlooked by researchers and have found very limited applications, while these methods have great potential and promise for several advanced device applications. This section is intended to address the needs of those specialists seeking for better alternative production methods for their specific application or possible new applications of their produced nanomaterials.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">In Section 5, we categorized all production methods of G6-TMD nanomaterials into four top-down methods including mechanical cleavage, liquid phase exfoliation, intercalation and exfoliation and thinning and two bottom-up methods, namely vapour deposition and solution-based synthesis. The four important criteria for utilizing a production method, from the application point of view, are lateral size and thickness (average number of layers) as well as production rate and crystalline qualities.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25</a> the aforementioned six main production methods are compared with respect to these four important criteria. Mechanical cleavage (MC) produces the highest quality nanosheets; however, its production rate is very low and requires long-time and careful search by a trained technician under a light microscope. The produced nanosheets by MC are randomly distributed on the substrate and there is no correlation between their lateral sizes and thicknesses, thus the rectangular shape of the corresponding area in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25</a>. Vapour deposition, thinning and liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) all produce nanosheets with fair crystalline quality. The thickness and lateral size can be controlled independently in the vapour deposition method which is indicated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25</a> by its rectangular shape. On the other hand, in LPE and thinning, the larger the produced nanosheets are the thicker they will be, which is evident by the oblique oval shape of the respective areas in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25</a>. Despite the similar quality of the produced nanosheets by these three methods, their production rates differ considerably, with LPE having the highest production rate and thinning having the lowest. Solution-based synthesis and intercalation and exfoliation (I&amp;E) both produce nanosheets with poor crystalline quality and the presence of several structural defects and crystal distortions is their inseparable nature. Generally, solution-based synthesis has a moderate production rate where as I&amp;E benefits from a high rate of production. The three methods of LPE, I&amp;E and solution-based synthesis have the potential to produce nanoparticles of very small sizes and even quantum dots.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">The remaining part of this section is devoted to a brief discussion of various technological applications of G6-TMDs and appropriate production methods for each application. For this purpose, we have categorized all reported applications of G6-TMD nanomaterials into five main areas, based on the structural and functional features of the nanomaterials needed by each application. The pertinent subsections are (opto)electronics, sensors, energy storage, catalysis and emerging applications. Each subsection is organized in such a way that first the basic concepts and common principles of the mentioned applications in that subsection are briefly introduced. Then, potential and utilized production methods for these applications are discussed in detail.

Since the silicon-based semiconductors have reached their fundamental performance limits and there is high demand from the electronics industry with a more than $330 billion market<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit726"><sup><span class="sup_ref">726</span></sup></a> to find new materials with higher performance and/or larger die size, essential to fabricate faster devices with lower power consumption, numerous research efforts have been made on newly discovered 2D materials. G6-TMDs, especially MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>, have a leading role along with graphene at the frontier, while they are more promising than graphene in many areas due to their appropriate bandgap, a property which is absent in graphene.

          <span>In digital applications, the transistor acts simply as a switch in which the current flow between its two terminals, called the source and drain, is controlled by applying a voltage to a third terminal, called the gate. The fabrication of the first transistor from transition metal dichalcogenide nanostructures should be credited to Novoselov, Geim and coworkers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> who fabricated transistors from micromechanically exfoliated MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets as well as graphene and NbSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> in 2004. However, it took nearly seven years for MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> to step out of the shadow of graphene and establish its own identity. Although the reported very high room-temperature electron mobility of ∼15<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> V<small><sup>−1</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for graphene by Novoselov <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> stimulated great interest in finding an ultimate solution to ultra-fast transistors, soon after it was realised that the absence of bandgap in graphene is a major barrier to utilize it in field effect transistors (FETs) for digital applications.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit732"><sup><span class="sup_ref">732,733</span></sup></a> In fact, graphene FET devices cannot be effectively switched off and the drain and source terminals are always short-circuited, causing high power consumption.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">In such a context, a MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> based transistor, whose mobility was initially measured by Novoselov <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> to be very low, in the range of 0.5–3 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> V<small><sup>−1</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, came to the forefront, benefiting from an appropriate bandgap of 1.9 eV (single layer), which could guarantee the off-state of the transistor to be really off, and a breakthrough of Kis’ group<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> in using HfO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, a material with a high dielectric constant, in a top-gated configuration FET to enhance the electron mobility of the MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> channel by dielectric screening (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26a</a>). Although there was some overestimation on the exact enhancement of the mobility,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit734"><sup><span class="sup_ref">734,735</span></sup></a> which will be discussed in more detail later, there is no debate that the work of Kis’ group injected fresh blood into the research field of 2D materials for electronic devices, especially G6-TMDs.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">While micromechanical cleavage has been the main production method of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets to fabricate transistors in fundamental research and prototyping, due to its inherent randomness and limitations in scalability, search for alternative production methods has always been an active field. The most likely candidate for rapid and large scale production of electronic-grade MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets in a controlled manner is CVD which was developed by several groups<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit503"><sup><span class="sup_ref">503,543,548</span></sup></a> immediately after the demonstration of the first MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> transistor in 2011.

The CVD method with controllability on size (up to wafer scale) and thickness (monolayer, bilayer and trilayer) by oxygen plasma treatment of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> substrates prior to deposition has also been reported and successfully employed for the fabrication of transistors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit737"><sup><span class="sup_ref">737</span></sup></a> The main concern in CVD growth of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets is the grain boundaries and by controlling the nucleation<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit533"><sup><span class="sup_ref">533</span></sup></a> or by using ultraclean substrates without seeds to nucleate growth,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a> large area single crystalline nanosheets with high electrical and optical quality comparable to micromechanically exfoliated samples are obtained. Other production methods including liquid phase exfoliation,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit738"><sup><span class="sup_ref">738</span></sup></a> lithium intercalation and exfoliation,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit454"><sup><span class="sup_ref">454</span></sup></a> laser thinning<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">191</span></sup></a> and thermal decomposition<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit700"><sup><span class="sup_ref">700</span></sup></a> are also used in the fabrication of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> based transistors. Among these methods, thermal decomposition seems to be the most promising and can be the competitor of conventional CVD, thanks to its homogeneous coverage of a large area<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit237"><sup><span class="sup_ref">237</span></sup></a> and relatively good mobility of the final film if annealed in an Ar/S atmosphere.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit700"><sup><span class="sup_ref">700</span></sup></a> However, it should be noted that the produced MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> samples by thermal decomposition are generally bilayer or trilayer films, and further optimization to produce homogeneous monolayer films still needs to be done. Recent studies on the thickness-dependent mobility of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> transistors revealed that the mobility of transistors based on monolayer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets is significantly higher than those based on bilayer and trilayer nanosheets if atmospheric adsorbates are avoided.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit739"><sup><span class="sup_ref">739</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">After the successful demonstration of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> transistors, other members of G6-TMDs also garnered attention for digital applications.

          <p class="otherpara">A major current trend in G6-TMD transistors is the control over the channel type (n-type and/or p-type), essential for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and constructing advanced integrated circuits. Micromechanically exfoliated MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets on SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si substrates commonly show n-type while WSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets on SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si usually exhibit p-type characteristics.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit728"><sup><span class="sup_ref">728,749</span></sup></a> However, an <span class="italic">ab initio</span> study of the origin of n-type and p-type behaviour of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers on SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> predicted that a defect-free ultra-clean SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> substrate plays an insignificant role in the type of conductivity of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, since the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> are located almost in the middle of the wide bandgap of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and accordingly SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in contact with MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> does not affect the Fermi level of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> toward n- or p-type conductivity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit750"><sup><span class="sup_ref">750</span></sup></a> Common n-type behaviour of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets on a SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> substrate is thus attributed to the presence of defects, adsorbates and interface impurities.

Spin and valley pseudospin of electrons are two degrees of freedom, just like charge of electrons, that can be exploited to process and storage information in future electronics.

          <p class="otherpara">The last panel of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26</a> shows a pie chart that represents the percentage of use of each production method of G6-TMDs in the ∼400 highly cited articles with orientation of (opto)electronics applications. These articles were extracted from a database of top 1000 most cited articles with the G6-TMD nanostructures in their topic based on Web of Science. Careful examination of the chart reveals that the micromechanical cleavage certainly is the first choice for the assessment of ideas and prototyping in (opto)electronics. The successful ideas then have the chance to be realized by two major scalable production methods, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and liquid phase exfoliation (LPE). In this regard, the CVD method is generally used in transistor related devices while LPE is more appropriate for saturable absorbers and memory devices. Currently the main challenges in the production of G6-TMD nanostructures by CVD for (opto)electronic applications are: (i) the precise control of the number of layers during the growth of nanosheets, (ii) epitaxial growth of films at the wafer scale with large single-crystalline domains and the lowest possible grain boundaries and (iii) growth at lower temperatures towards direct deposition on various substrates other than SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Si, for example ITO, FTO and flexible polymeric substrates. The main directions that should be followed for LPE are (i) further optimization of parameters to increase the yield of monolayer and simultaneously (ii) increase the lateral size of the produced nanosheets at least above 10 μm. Li intercalation due to the inherently unstable nature of the produced 1T phase has received little attention in the field of (opto)electronics; however, there is great potential if (i) an appropriate stabilization method of metallic 1T or (ii) a rapid and efficient transformation method from metallic 1T to 2H semiconducting phase without agglomeration and restacking can be developed. Other methods, including thinning and solution-based methods were not often the focus of researchers in (opto)electronics, but in our opinion, laser thinning, etching and notably thermal decomposition – as a scalable method, have great potential to be employed in many state-of-the-art (opto)electronic devices and thus deserve more attention.</p>

        <span>Energy storage is one of the most important and relevant application areas of G6-TMD nanomaterials. Inevitable run out of fossil fuels in a few decades ahead and increasing environmental concerns worldwide have shifted global energy policy from oil and gas to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energies. However, these types of energies, even at a specific area, generally depend on daytime and seasonal changes; thus energy storage devices become of paramount importance for stabilizing supply of renewable energies at all times and in all places. Several energy conversion/storage devices are under intensive research and development, including fuel cells, batteries, capacitors and supercapacitors.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit869"><sup><span class="sup_ref">869,870</span></sup></a> The two main figures of merit of any energy storage device are the specific energy measured in W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the specific power in W kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29a</a> shows a comparison of different technologies for energy storage with respect to these metrics, called the Ragone plot.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit869"><sup><span class="sup_ref">869,871,872</span></sup></a> Fuel cells are of high specific energy and they are intended to replace fossil fuels in heavy industries and electric cars.

In energy storage devices, conventional capacitors are of high specific power and can deliver a large amount of energy in a short period of time on the order of milliseconds. Batteries and supercapacitors have also their own place in this plot. Today, commercial batteries can supply a relatively high specific energy of 100–300 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with a typical full charge/discharge cycle of about 1 h but suffer from low specific power of 10–100 W kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit870"><sup><span class="sup_ref">870,873</span></sup></a> Supercapacitors are a newer technology and developed to fill the gap between high specific energy batteries and high specific power capacitors.

          <span>G6-TMD nanomaterials show great promise as anode materials in batteries to replace commercially used graphite mainly due to their high aptitude for intercalation. The mechanism of electrochemical energy storage in G6-TMD based batteries can be understood by taking MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a representative example. In a typical experiment, a common two-electrode half-cell battery configuration is used with MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> as the working electrode and a lithium foil as the counter electrode. The series of chemical reactions that take place can be tracked by cyclic voltammetry (CV) or galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29e and f</a> for a typical example). In each cycle, first MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is intercalated with Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions (lithiation) and then is deintercalated (delithiation) to complete the cycle. In the first lithiation/delithiation cycle, two peaks are generally observed in the cathodic branch of cyclic voltammograms, equivalent to two plateaus in the discharge curve of galvanostatic tests, corresponding to intercalation of Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions into the MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> layered structure and conversion of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> into metallic Mo particles embedded in a Li<small><sub>2</sub></small>S matrix, according to the following equations:<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit665"><sup><span class="sup_ref">665,899–901</span></sup></a><table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn20"/><span id="eqn20">MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> + <span class="italic">x</span>Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> + <span class="italic">x</span>e<small><sup>−</sup></small> → Li<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small></span></td><td class="rightEqn">(20)</td></tr></table><table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn21"/><span id="eqn21">MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> + 4Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> + 4e<small><sup>−</sup></small> → 2Li<small><sub>2</sub></small>S + Mo</span></td><td class="rightEqn">(21)</td></tr></table></span>

          <p class="otherpara">According to <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab9">Table 9</a>, application of G6-TMDs in LIBs can be divided into two main categories of anode electrodes based on pure G6-TMDs (data entries 1 to 7) and anode electrodes based on G6-TMD composites (data entries 8 to 25). In the route of using pure G6-TMDs, two strategies have been effectively tested including, (i) synthesis of nanomaterials with hierarchical structures and ultrahigh specific surface area, and (ii) increasing the interlayer distance of layered structures through synthesizing expanded layer G6-TMDs. For example, Lou and coworkers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit904"><sup><span class="sup_ref">904</span></sup></a> fabricated MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> hollow nanospheres with an average diameter around 600 nm, a hierarchical shell about 140 nm thick and a specific surface area of 31.5 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> through a solvothermal process and achieved a high reversible capacity of 1100 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 100 cycles at 500 mA g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, along with a good rate capability and cycling stability. The advantages of hierarchical structuring of pure G6-TMDs are (i) rapid diffusion of Li ions due to large contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and (ii) inhibiting electrode pulverization in repetitive intercalation/deintercalation cycles thanks to their hollow and relatively elastic structure.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit876"><sup><span class="sup_ref">876</span></sup></a> However in this strategy, a generally complicated and time consuming synthesis procedure and low volumetric energy densities should be addressed. Another strategy for employing pure G6-TMDs in batteries is fabrication of interlayer expanded structures with similar pros and cons to hierarchical structuring but in a more effective way of intercalation/deintercalation and better volumetric energy densities. As a representative work, Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit905"><sup><span class="sup_ref">905</span></sup></a> synthesized mesoporous MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> anode electrodes with expanded interlayer distance along the <span class="italic">c</span>-axis from original 0.616 nm to 0.656 nm through impregnation of Mo precursors on commercial silica templates and then sulfurization in a CVD setup and removal of the template. The fabricated mesoporous electrodes had a specific surface area of 130 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and exhibited a high reversible capacity of 876 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 100 cycles at 100 mA g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 97.3% capacity retention compared to the second cycle. The electrodes also had high rate performance with capacity as high as 608 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 10 A g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Engineering of pure G6-TMDs, either through hierarchical structuring or interlayer expansion, has inherent limitations principally due to the low electrical conductivity of G6-TMDs. Consequently, compositing with other conductive nanomaterials is now the main research direction for employing G6-TMDs as the anode electrode in Li-ion batteries. Several nanomaterials, including (i) graphene and its derivatives (data entries 8 to 15 in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab9">Table 9</a>), (ii) nanotubes and nanofibres (data entries 16 to 21) and (iii) amorphous carbon and other nanoparticles (data entries 22 to 25) have been examined to make advanced composite electrodes based on G6-TMDs. The advantages of compositing can be summarized as (i) enhancing the conductivity of G6-TMDs for achieving a higher rate performance, (ii) providing an elastic matrix for G6-TMDs to be easily intercalated/deintercalated without being pulverized during repetitive expansion/contraction and thus achieving a higher cycle stability, and (iii) preventing G6-TMD nanosheets from restacking for a higher reversible capacity. As a representative example, Zhang and coworkers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit898"><sup><span class="sup_ref">898</span></sup></a> loaded MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets onto a 3D graphene network by a facile thermal decomposition of (NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>MoS<small><sub>4</sub></small> precursor solution in which 3D graphene was soaked before and achieved excellent electrochemical performances (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29e–g</a>). They obtained a reversible capacity of 877 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The fabricated MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>/3D-graphene-network also exhibited a high rate performance with a discharge capacity of 597 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at the 10th cycle and 1 A g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Zhu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit721"><sup><span class="sup_ref">721</span></sup></a> also fabricated an advanced binder-free 3D porous anode electrode by integrating electroactive 0D MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> quantum dots, conductive 1D carbon nanotubes and 2D graphene nanosheets. MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> quantum dots were effectively interconnected through the CNT network and graphene backbone. Due to ultra-small sizes (0.5–5 nm) of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> quantum dots, diffusion of Li ions was facilitated and pulverization of the electrode was largely mitigated. Reversible capacities of 886 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 100 cycles at 1000 mA g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 652 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 10<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 mA g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> are indicative of the outstanding cycling stability and rate capability of such multi-dimensional composite electrodes for Li-ion battery applications. Another interesting idea is pre-lithiation of the anode electrode to minimize the irreversible capacity. Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit899"><sup><span class="sup_ref">899</span></sup></a> implemented pre-lithiation simply by bringing a lithium foil into direct contact with MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>/onion-like-carbon electrodes. Pre-lithiated electrodes showed a Coulombic efficiency of 97.6% compared with 71.1% for the pristine electrode. cycling performance of the electrodes was also enhanced by pre-lithiation and a high reversible capacity of 721 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 100 cycles was reached. The underlying mechanism of capacity fading during initial cycles and some possible solutions other than pre-lithiation were also proposed by Shu and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit934"><sup><span class="sup_ref">934</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are attractive alternatives to lithium-ion batteries mainly because of the abundance of sodium resources in nature compared with lithium resources and their much lower cost.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit935"><sup><span class="sup_ref">935,936</span></sup></a> The theoretical specific capacity of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> for sodium intercalation is 668 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> which is equal to the theoretical capacity of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based LIBs.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit937"><sup><span class="sup_ref">937,938</span></sup></a> Some notable SIB works based on G6-TMDs are summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab9">Table 9</a> (data entries 26 to 36). It is evident from this table that currently the electrochemical performance of SIBs is inferior to LIBs as a mature field of research. This is mainly because of the larger effective ionic radius of Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> (1.06 Å) in comparison with Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> (0.76 Å) which leads to slower kinetics in SIBs (consequently, lower rate capability of SIBs) and larger volume change during repetitive sodiation/desodiation (consequently, lower cycle stability of SIBs).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit935"><sup><span class="sup_ref">935</span></sup></a> Some strategies have been put forward to overcome these limitations. For example, Hu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit926"><sup><span class="sup_ref">926</span></sup></a> synthesized MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoflowers with an expanded interlayer along the <span class="italic">c</span>-axis through a facile hydrothermal method. By controlling the voltage window of charge/discharge in the range of 0.4–3 V, they prevented highly irreversible conversion to Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>S and kept their battery in the intercalation regime. With this strategy, a reversible specific capacity of 295 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 300 cycles at 200 mA g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a good rate capability were achieved. Developing unique heterostructures, such as 3D MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>–graphene microspheres<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit923"><sup><span class="sup_ref">923</span></sup></a> or MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> wrinkled nanosheets sandwiched between N-doped carbon and vertical graphene grown on carbon cloth,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit925"><sup><span class="sup_ref">925</span></sup></a> is another useful strategy to achieve superior Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> storage properties, mainly due to the enhanced electrode conductivity and more effective interaction of fabricated electrodes with the electrolyte. Treating of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> in chlorosulfonic superacid before compositing with graphene for better exfoliation and creating defects in nanosheet basal planes as additional electroactive sites and extra pathways for ion diffusion were also reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit929"><sup><span class="sup_ref">929</span></sup></a> Zhou <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit915"><sup><span class="sup_ref">915</span></sup></a> also employed thermal decomposition of electrospun (NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>MoS<small><sub>4</sub></small>–PVP fibres to fabricate single layer MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanodots embedded in carbon nanofibres and achieved good electrochemical performance for sodium storage. Since the carbon matrix is conductive with regard to electrons and sodium ions, MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanodots were electrochemically coupled to each other, perfectly. On the other hand, their ultra-small sizes reduce the diffusion length of ions, and moreover, their single layer structure totally nullify intercalation problems and Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions can directly be attached to the surface of nanodots. Xu and coworkers have reviewed recent progress in the application of layered metal dichalcogenides as the anode electrode for sodium-ion batteries and discussed several strategies for enhancing the electrochemical performance of these electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit939"><sup><span class="sup_ref">939</span></sup></a></p>

          <span>Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are rapidly growing energy storage devices that are intended to fill the gap between batteries with high energy storage but low power capability and conventional capacitors with high power output but low energy storage capacity. Today commercial supercapacitors with electrodes composed of activated carbon, metal oxides or conductive polymers can deliver 1–10 kW kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> specific power with a lifetime of more than 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> cycles and a specific power of 100 kW kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> is targeted for near future.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit870"><sup><span class="sup_ref">870,872</span></sup></a> Charge storage in supercapacitors is based on two distinct mechanisms, namely electrical double layer and pseudocapacitance.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit872"><sup><span class="sup_ref">872,874,880,958</span></sup></a> The electrical double layer occurs at the interface of the electrode and the electrolyte and electrostatically accumulates charge. In this respect any conductive material with a high specific area is potentially a candidate electrode for electrical double layer charge storage. The most successful material so far has been activated carbon; however G6-TMD nanomaterials with fair electrical conductivity and high surface to volume ratio coming from their nanosized dimensions are also promising. On the other hand, pseudocapacitive charge storage itself is divided into two main classes of redox-based pseudocapacitance and intercalative pseudocapacitance. The former is a special capacitive behaviour due to fast and reversible oxidation/reduction reactions which is observed in some metal oxides, such RuO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit874"><sup><span class="sup_ref">874,959,960</span></sup></a> and its existence for G6-TMDs is still under debate.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit961"><sup><span class="sup_ref">961–963</span></sup></a> However, G6-TMDs due to their layered structure can be fully exploited for intercalative pseudocapacitance and in conjunction with their electrical double layer capacitance, they have high potential to be explored as supercapacitor electrodes.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab10">Table 10</a> summarizes some selected supercapacitor electrodes based on G6-TMD nanomaterials produced by various production methods. Main routes for enhancing the capacitive performance of G6-TMDs can be summarized as (i) synthesis of nanomaterials with a higher specific surface area and well designed nanostructures for better charge diffusion and transport, (ii) increasing the conductivity of the material either through phase engineering, doping, <span class="italic">etc.</span> or compositing with high conductive materials. Dryfe and coworkers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit964"><sup><span class="sup_ref">964</span></sup></a> compared various transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WS<small><sub>2</sub></small> as the electrode for supercapacitors. In their experimental framework and by using liquid phase exfoliation for fabrication of binder-free electrodes, WS<small><sub>2</sub></small> exhibited the highest electrochemical performance and MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> was the worst. Compositing with graphene to enhance the electrical conductivity of G6-TMDs and compositing with conductive polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy), to both enhance the conductivity and exploiting the intrinsic pseudocapacitive properties of conductive polymers, have been widely investigated (see <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab10">Table 10</a>). As a typical example, Ma <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit656"><sup><span class="sup_ref">656</span></sup></a> synthesized MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoflowers through a hydrothermal method and then fabricated PPy/MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanocomposite electrodes by an <span class="italic">in situ</span> polymerization technique and achieved high specific capacitance of 553.7 F g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 1 A g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with a 90% capacitance retention after 500 cycles and about 80% rate capability by increasing current density from 1 to 10 A g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Ye, Ajayan and coworkers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit965"><sup><span class="sup_ref">965</span></sup></a> also demonstrated a ternary composite of CoNi<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>4</sub></small>–graphene–MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> as an electrode for supercapacitors with a superior specific capacitance of 1141 F g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 1 A g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> scan rate with 108% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles and a satisfactory rate performance. In their fabricated composite electrodes, graphene provided electrical conductivity while liquid phase exfoliated MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets and hydrothermally synthesized CoNi<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>4</sub></small> were electroactive materials for rapid charge storage and release. A large step forward in real-world application of G6-TMDs as supercapacitor electrodes has taken by Chhowalla and his colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit444"><sup><span class="sup_ref">444</span></sup></a> who employed metallic 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> to overcome the low electrical conductivity limitation of common semiconducting 2H polytypes. They chemically exfoliated bulk MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> by lithium intercalation/exfoliation method and then used restacked 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> monolayers as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors with various aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29h and i</a>). Nearly rectangular shape of CV curves in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29h</a> verifies the capacitive behaviour of the fabricated electrodes and the similarity between CV results in K<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and KCl electrolytes indicates the cationic intercalating nature of the charge storage. 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> electrodes exhibited 20 times better specific gravimetric capacitance compared with 2H-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> electrodes. Such a high enhancement of electrochemical storage properties was attributed to (i) high electrical conductivity of 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, (ii) hydrophilicity of 1T-MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets and their better interaction with the electrolyte, (iii) preservation of intercalation ability upon transformation from 2H to 1T and (iv) devoiding binder or other additives in the fabrication of electrodes. Depending on the electrolyte, high volumetric capacitances ranging from 400 to 650 F cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> (80 to 130 F g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) were achieved in aqueous media accompanied by a high cyclability (97% after 5000 cycles) and a suitable rate capability. Extended working potential window of 3.5 V was also demonstrated in non-aqueous organic electrolytes.

As one may expect, the majority of researchers adopted solution-based synthesis, mainly hydrothermal and solvothermal methods, due to its facile procedure, scalability, variety of morphologies that can be synthesized and possibility of producing G6-TMD nanomaterials composite with other nanomaterials, especially graphene and polymers, in one step. A possible promising future research direction that can be envisioned for hydrothermal, solvothermal and colloidal synthesis methods is the direct fabrication of nanoarchitectures or nanocomposites of the metallic 1T polytype, a task that is currently performed through the intercalation and exfoliation technique. However, at least for the near future, intercalation and exfoliation is the only scalable way for producing metallic G6-TMDs and this is the main reason that it occupies the second place among production methods. Liquid phase exfoliation (primarily sonication and exfoliation) has its own place due to its versatility and ease to implement the procedure as well as the advantage of producing nanosheets in the liquid phase that can then be directly used for the fabrication of electrodes with simple drop-casting or spin-coating techniques. However, control over the lateral size and thickness of exfoliated nanosheets is the main challenge in LPE that should be overcome. Vapour deposition techniques, importantly CVD, are also promising especially with electrodes of complex structural design, such as G6-TMDs on 3D-graphene or carbon-cloth.</p>

        <span>Bulk MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a representative of G6-TMDs has been long known as an industrial catalyst for Hydrotreating (HDT) processes including hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), which remove sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen atoms from heavy petroleum and natural gas, respectively. The first step in the HDT process is the adsorption of hydrogen atom on the catalyst surface, which is similar to the first step in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In 1977, Tributsch <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit990"><sup><span class="sup_ref">990</span></sup></a> examined bulk crystal of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a potential candidate for electrochemical HER and the results exhibited its poor catalytic activity. But, in 2005, the Nørskov group<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit991"><sup><span class="sup_ref">991</span></sup></a> used DFT calculations and demonstrated that the edge sites of the MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles were catalytically active sites for HER, while the basal plane was inactive. Following this, in 2007, Jaramillo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit992"><sup><span class="sup_ref">992</span></sup></a> confirmed that the Gibbs free energy for atomic hydrogen adsorption (Δ<span class="italic">G</span><small><sub>H*</sub></small>) on the edge sites of nanoscale MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> was comparable to that of the Pt metal as a conventional HER catalyst. Therefore, various attempts have been made in recent years to modify MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and G6-TMDs towards efficient HER catalysts. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig30">Fig. 30a</a> shows the summary of the studies conducted on the optimization of HER activity of G6-TMD nanomaterials.</span>

We briefly point out some of the drawbacks and limitations in the development of G6-TMDs as a photocatalyst in the following:</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(i) Direct bandgap semiconductors are effective photocatalysts, therefore, to obtain effective photocatalytic activity, monolayer G6-TMDs with a direct band gap (see Section 3) should be applied. But there is insufficient optical absorbance in monolayers, which reduces their photocatalytic efficiency.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1056"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1056</span></sup></a> (ii) A monolayer with a direct band gap is appropriate in photocatalytic applications, but, currently, the fabrication of a uniform and homogeneous monolayer is the main obstacle. (iii) The edges are the catalytically active sites for hydrogen adsorption, but they can act as a recombination center in the photocatalytic process and deteriorate the activity. (iv) As the surface of the G6-TMD nanomaterials is a suitable site for electron transfer and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> generation, using them as a photosensitizer in the photoanode, at which the ORR occurs, is not recommended. Regarding the above barriers, it is suggested that applying G6-TMD nanomaterials as a co-catalyst in slurry photocatalytic hydrogen production or as a photocathode in a PEC water splitting tandem cell can be more useful. Moreover, the 1T phase can be a good choice as a co-catalyst in both photocatalytic systems.</p>

In order to compensate for their low electron mobility and conductivity, their nanocomposites are more desired. However, a suitable chemical interaction between the compartments is necessary for efficient charge carrier separation and transfer in their nanocomposites. Therefore, mechanical cleavage and thinning routes are not appropriate for nanocomposite fabrication. In contrast, solvo(hydro)thermal is a good candidate for nanocomposite preparation, but, hardly results in monolayer TMDs with a direct band gap, which is mandatory for efficient visible light absorption and photocatalytic activity.

        <h3 id="sect9025"><span class="b_heading">Basic science and fundamental research perspective</span></h3>
        <span>Various physicochemical properties of pure single-crystalline nanosheets of G6-TMDs are now determined and measured. Structural parameters, bandgaps and carriers’ effective masses and mobilities of monolayer and bulk G6-TMDs were tabulated in Section 3. However, there are some inconsistencies in reported values, even for very common properties, such as the bandgap. Besides, there is an evident lack of experimental data for fewlayer nanosheets. In addition, some important properties, such as electronic band position relative to vacuum, are rarely measured for G6-TMDs. In this regard, we suggest and encourage a series of benchmarking measurements in a joint experimental and theoretical framework to tabulate important optical, electronic, thermal, mechanical and magnetic properties of G6-TMDs with respect to the number of layers from monolayer to five-layer nanosheets. Theoretical prediction and experimental measurement of these properties for alloys, heterostructures and mixed phases of G6-TMDs are also of great importance and we anticipate that they will be a major research goal for the future. In particular, recent advances of vertical and lateral heterostructuring of G6-TMD nanosheets with other 2D materials, for example graphene, phosphorene and h-BN, have opened up a new avenue in the field of 2D materials to fabricate artificial materials with tailored electronic and optical properties.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit612"><sup><span class="sup_ref">612,1219–1221</span></sup></a> This research area is still relatively unexplored and intact, with many fascinating opportunities lying ahead and will, without doubt, become a key research frontier.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">While semiconducting polytypes of G6-TMDs have been the focus of most research in recent years, metastable metallic polytypes also have great potential for a wide range of applications from catalysis to optoelectronics. The catalytic activity of metallic G6-TMDs is proved to be significantly higher than their semiconducting counterparts.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit998"><sup><span class="sup_ref">998,1026,1027</span></sup></a> The metallic phase in electronics based on semiconducting G6-TMDs can also play the role that silicides do in silicon-based electronics to achieve good ohmic contacts and high switching speeds with a gradual change from a semiconducting channel to external metallic contacts.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192,1222,1223</span></sup></a> Thus we are confident that enticing prospects for phase engineering of G6-TMDs will attract much more attention in future years to find effective and industry-compatible methods for stabilization of the metallic phase.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An in depth understanding of photogain and photoconduction mechanisms in G6-TMDs and accurate determination of associated lifetimes of exciton dissociation and recombination is a crucial and challenging task that would be essential for further advancement of many photo-related applications, such as photonics and photocatalysis. Systematic investigation with advanced techniques, for instance time resolved PL and spectral hole burning, along with theoretical studies, such as time dependent density functional theory, can provide a better understanding of intrinsic relaxation time of excitons in G6-TMDs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit807"><sup><span class="sup_ref">807</span></sup></a> In particular, the mechanism of non-radiative decay of excitons and their timescales in both nanosheets and van der Waals heterostructures are of great importance. The underlying physics behind the dark excitons and their different origins in Mo-based and W-based G6-TMDs also need more elaboration and clarification.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In characterization methods, despite considerable progress, developing a non-contact method with an <span class="italic">in situ</span> capability to quickly determine the average thickness and lateral size of dispersed nanosheets in various solvents is increasingly needed. While some methods, such as dynamic light scattering<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> for determination of the lateral size and extinction spectroscopy<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit254"><sup><span class="sup_ref">254</span></sup></a> for determination of both average number of layers and lateral size are currently available, but they rely on sophisticated apparatus, such as an integrating sphere and indeed have not yet been calibrated for G6-TMDs other than MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and WS<small><sub>2</sub></small>. A characterization method of nanosheet dispersions with facile and user-friendly procedure for size determination is still lacking and highly demanded.</p>
      
      
        <h3 id="sect9040"><span class="b_heading">Production method perspective</span></h3>
        <span>Production method is the bottleneck of real-world applications, not only for G6-TMD nanomaterials, but also for many other nanomaterials, such as graphene, phosphorene, carbon quantum dots and nanoribbons. For G6-TMDs, both extremes of a large single-crystalline nanosheet with perfect electronic and optical properties for (opto)electronic applications and very small defective nanoparticles with abundant chemically active edge sites for catalytic and energy applications are favourable. Regarding production of high-quality nanosheets, apart from micromechanical cleavage which is a lab-scale rapid route for assessment of the ideas and prototyping, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) appears to be the most appropriate method, with physical vapour deposition (PVD) and thermal decomposition (TD) its chief competitors. For production of small nanoparticles, the hydro/solvothermal route and liquid phase exfoliation are the two most prevailing candidates. Other production methods, including intercalation and exfoliation and thinning are powerful tools that can be employed either stand-alone or as complementary to the above mentioned methods.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">CVD is an efficient production method of G6-TMD nanosheets and as discussed in Section 5.5.1, a variety of successful strategies have been developed to deposit a large area of G6-TMDs with uniform thickness and high-quality.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32,41</span></sup></a> The main challenges in the CVD method are the control over the lateral size and thickness of deposited nanosheets, with the ultimate goal of achieving a continuous wafer-scale single-crystalline nanosheet with a desired number of layers (usually a monolayer) without any grain boundary, dislocation and defect. To this end, metal–organic CVD,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit508"><sup><span class="sup_ref">508</span></sup></a> epitaxial growth on graphene,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1224"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1224</span></sup></a> sapphire,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> mica<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit537"><sup><span class="sup_ref">537</span></sup></a> and other insulating substrates as well as atomic layer deposition<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit562"><sup><span class="sup_ref">562</span></sup></a> routes are actively being pursued. The possibility of alloying, doping and direct growth of lateral and vertical heterostructures is another great advantage of CVD which provides appealing opportunities for bandgap and mobility engineering as well as tailoring physicochemical properties. Although there are several lessons that can be learned from CVD growth of graphene for G6-TMDs, it should be kept in mind that the covalent interlayer and van der Waals intralayer bonding in G6-TMDs are weaker than in graphene.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit484"><sup><span class="sup_ref">484,494</span></sup></a> In fact, the weaker bonding in G6-TMDs facilitates the usage of physical production methods, such as PVD and thinning, that have not been common and convenient for the production of graphene.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">PVD techniques, including sputtering, pulsed laser deposition and thermal evaporation-deposition (see Section 5.5.2), have the advantage of single-source one-step deposition with the correct stoichiometric ratio in an easy to implement procedure. Furthermore, PVD is an industrially compatible technique and hence deserves much more attention and investigation to find its optimum parameters and conditions, especially for G6-TMDs other than MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, as very limited reports are available for them. Thinning methods, including laser thinning, thermal annealing, plasma treatment and etching, can also be effectively employed in conjunction with CVD and PVD methods to enhance the quality and functionality of final products. For example, a mild <span class="italic">in situ</span> thermal annealing after CVD growth may remove the incomplete and defective top-most layers and improve the thickness uniformity and crystalline quality of the produced nanosheets. Thermal decomposition is also a promising route for uniform wafer scale growth of G6-TMDs, which is currently limited by difficulties in monolayer production. However, we believe that this is only a technical issue and there is no fundamental obstacle to achieve uniform monolayer G6-TMDs with this method. A precise deposition of precursor with controlled spin-coating or dip-coating should resolve the issue. Meanwhile, thermal decomposition is very simple and cost-effective for the production of large-area fewlayer nanosheets and also has the potential to be employed for various template base approaches and in addition is compatible with industrial processes.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Small nanosheets and nanoparticles of G6-TMDs, if can be made available in large quantity at low cost, would be of great interest for energy and catalysis applications. Wet chemical routes, including solvothermal, hydrothermal and colloidal syntheses, are routine production methods to this end and are widely employed. They also benefit from the advantage of facile and direct fabrication of G6-TMD nanocomposites with other materials, such as graphene and metal nanoparticles, to provide improved functionality. One of the main research directions in wet chemical synthesis is the ability to independently control the thickness and lateral size of the produced nanosheets. Developing a procedure with continuous feeding of precursors is another important improvement in wet chemical synthesis that has been actively sought for commercialization of G6-TMD catalysts and energy storage devices.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is an established and widely used production method for G6-TMD nanosheets and quantum dots, that was discussed in Section 5.2. Three mechanisms have been suggested for exfoliation and stabilization of bulk 2D materials by LPE, one based on the matching of solubility parameters,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit282"><sup><span class="sup_ref">282,366</span></sup></a> quantified with surface tension, Hildebrand or Hansen solubility parameters, another based on formation of intermediate redox active species during autoxidation of the solvent (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> NMP) by sonication<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit284"><sup><span class="sup_ref">284,420</span></sup></a> and the third based on solvent–solvent interaction through hydrogen bonding in some appropriate cosolvent systems, such as the water/NMP mixture.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit418"><sup><span class="sup_ref">418,419</span></sup></a> We believe that any further advancement in LPE relies strongly upon solving this puzzle and determining the underlying mechanism with a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Other current trends in LPE, such as utilizing a mixture of solvents and optimizing parameters to obtain larger and thinner nanosheets can be accelerated with the correct mechanism in hand. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that LPE could compete with CVD and PVD for scalable production of large-sized high-quality monolayer nanosheets and it is expedient for research activities in LPE to be focused on production of large-quantity sub-micrometre fewlayer nanosheets for catalysis and energy applications, where single layer and high quality nanosheets are not of primary concern. LPE can also contribute a considerable share in printed flexible electronics by developing suitable semiconducting inks for inkjet printing.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Intercalation and exfoliation is another scalable production method for G6-TMD nanosheets which has been known and extensively studied for decades. The main drawback of this method is the phase change of G6-TMDs from stable semiconducting to a metastable metallic phase upon intercalation which, in turn, may become an advantage if a breakthrough in stabilization of metallic phase occurs. Use of intercalants other than lithium to produce larger nanosheets with a higher yield is an emerging trend of this production method. Intercalation and exfoliation has also great potential to be combined with other production methods, such as liquid phase exfoliation or solvo/hydrothermal to achieve higher quality and/or quantity performance.</p>
      
      
        <h3 id="sect9061"><span class="b_heading">Technological application perspective</span></h3>
        <span>Technological applications of G6-TMDs were discussed in detail in Section 6 and several existing and emerging applications were highlighted and explained. In (opto)electronics, it is believed that while rather low electron mobility of G6-TMDs might pose a barrier at this time, by the advancement of technology and more miniaturization of transistor feature size to sub-10 nm node, the situation will change. At this aggressively reduced length scales, the transport of carriers changes from the diffusive regime to the ballistic regime and the mobility concept is no longer relevant. Ultimate thinness which provides precise control on transistor channels made from G6-TMD nanosheets along with an appropriate bandgap (1–2 eV) and relatively high electron effective mass of G6-TMDs, which prevents the short channel effects, are competitive advantages that will soon challenge the position of conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs. Meanwhile, fabrication of flexible, transparent and cost effective thin film transistors for applications, such as displays, is a domain that is highly anticipated G6-TMDs can replace current technology based on amorphous silicon and InGaZnO. Many other promising (opto)electronic applications of G6-TMDs in saturable absorbers, optical cavities, spin/valleytronics, memory devices, light emitting diodes, analog and RF applications and complementary logic circuits as well as gas sensors and biosensors have been discussed and several important future research directions have been outlined in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In energy-related applications, such as Li ion batteries and supercapacitors, G6-TMD nanomaterials have clear advantages of (i) high available surface area, (ii) abundance of active reaction sites at edges and defects, (iii) great potential for rapid intercalation of various cations, (iv) short diffusion path lengths for ions, (v) good chemical stability and (vi) lightness and flexibility. However, there are some issues that should be resolved before full potential of G6-TMDs can be realized in the field of energy. First and foremost is their low electrical conductivity, which hinders full utilization of the whole surface area and all active sites. Hybridizing with conductive materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, in composites or hierarchical structures is a possible solution which is actively being pursued. Another strategy could be the stabilization of 1T metallic phase of G6-TMDs which has shown very promising preliminary results<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit444"><sup><span class="sup_ref">444,934</span></sup></a> and may revolutionize the energy field if done in a facile and industrially viable process.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In lithium ion batteries (LIBs), it seems that the application of G6-TMDs should be focused on replacing the conventional graphite anode and competing with a LiCoO<small><sub>2</sub></small> cathode electrode is not justified at this stage.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit885"><sup><span class="sup_ref">885</span></sup></a> For G6-TMD-based anode electrodes, <span class="italic">in situ</span> and <span class="italic">operando</span> characterizations in conjunction with theoretical investigation of intercalation/deintercalation mechanism and diffusion pathways of Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> during charge/decharge cycles are of paramount importance and priority. Low rate capability and slow rate performance of G6-TMD-based LIBs may be clarified by studying the mechanism of intercalation. To improve the cycle stability of fabricated LIBs with G6-TMD anode, mechanical stability of the layered structure of G6-TMDs in the repeated expansion and contraction during intercalation/deintercaltion should be further investigated. Moreover, careful studies should be conducted to address the irreversible capacity of G6-TMD-based LIBs. This irreversibility is mainly due to electrolyte decomposition at the surface of electrodes and trapping of Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions between G6-TMD layers and unsuccessful deintercalation in discharge.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit888"><sup><span class="sup_ref">888</span></sup></a> To minimize irreversible capacity, stabilization of common electrolytes or employing other new electrolytes as well as pre-lithium intercalation of G6-TMD electrode, pillaring the electrode with other intercalants or pre-incorporating and wetting it with electrolytes are promising future research directions.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit945"><sup><span class="sup_ref">945,968</span></sup></a> In supercapacitors, G6-TMD nanomaterials are encouraging candidates to replace activated carbon electrodes which are currently used in the majority of commercial supercapacitors. Accurate measurement of the quantum capacitances of G6-TMDs is still lacking and the pertinent theoretical framework has yet to be developed. Work towards fabrication of more electrically conductive G6-TMD electrodes to enhance electric double layer capacitance and achieving a better cycle stability by further exploiting pseudocapacitance of G6-TMDs are important future research directions in supercapacitors based on G6-TMD nanomaterials. For the near-future, targeting a battery with at least 250 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> energy density and over 5000 cyclability and a supercapacitor with a power density of 100 kW kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> can effectively guide efforts and investments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit870"><sup><span class="sup_ref">870</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Catalysis applications of G6-TMD nanomaterials, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS), were also reviewed in Section 6.4 and some potential future directions were outlined and discussed there. In general, for catalysis more chemically active sites are better and since the edges are catalytically active in G6-TMDs, a major trend in catalysts based on G6-TMDs is to produce small and defect-rich nanoclusters with abundant edges. Chemical activation of the basal planes of G6-TMD nanosheets either by functionalization or by alloying is also a new emerging trend. Again similar to other applications, low electrical conductivity of G6-TMDs is a big challenge which can be settled by hybridizing them with other conductive materials, or more desirably, by stabilizing their metallic phase. Assembling of small G6-TMD clusters in complex 3D structures with controllable pore size is also increasingly being recognised and established. More fundamentally, an in-depth understanding of the mechanism involved in the catalysis reaction on G6-TMDs over a wide pH range, especially in alkaline media, which has remained rather unexplored, will provide insight to develop more stable and efficient catalysts. Coupling of a catalytically active G6-TMD layer with a metal back contact is also of crucial importance and there are still many challenges ahead to achieve a good ohmic contact.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally, many emerging applications and new observed phenomena, such as photoluminescence with near-unity quantum yield, single photon emitting, thermoelectric power generation, osmotic power generation, water disinfection, biosensing and bioimaging as well as photo-related applications, such as photochemical, photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photocatalytic (PC) water splitting, were introduced and discussed in Section 6.5. It should be emphasized that facile and scalable production of large-sized monolayer nanosheets is the most serious challenge in many of these applications, especially those based on light–matter interaction. After all, in this realm there are many exciting opportunities and unexplored areas and the only limit is our imagination. In the end, we sincerely hope our review will provide a new insight to inspire innovation, spark original ideas and stimulate further progress in this rapid growing research field.</p>
