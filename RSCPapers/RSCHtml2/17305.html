Hopefully, this will enable readers interested in that topic to locate all of the relevant papers more easily. There is no doubting that laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) is still the most rapidly expanding technique of interest for “industrial” samples. Its use for on-line or standoff analysis covers many topic areas including the metals production, scrap metal and plastic sorting industries, nuclear applications, <span class="italic">in situ</span> analysis of remote systems, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> power cable insulators, <span class="italic">etc.</span> It is also regarded as being minimally damaging to samples and has therefore found extensive use in the analysis of cultural heritage samples; especially when used in conjunction with chemometric tools to identify provenance or chronology. For the analysis of fuels, it was disappointing to see so many papers re-inventing the wheel, with numerous applications being published that offer little improvement on existing standard methods. In many cases, the protocols described were very lengthy or complicated and succeeded only in obtaining a similar result to an existing method, but with poorer precision and with no benefit to the end user. Other areas, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> catalysts has a huge amount of interest. However, the techniques used to characterise the materials are mature and often, many of the papers published do not discuss the analytical science in any detail. The analysis of pharmaceuticals and personal care products has had a large increase in research interest during this review period. This is potentially because of traditional methods, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> atomic absorption, slowly being replaced by more modern techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> ICP-MS. Other growth areas of research have been the analysis of thin films, semiconductors and solar cells. Here, it is often X-ray-based analytical methods that are most commonly used, although some depth-profiling applications will use either LIBS or LA-ICP-MS. Another very popular area of research is that of nanoparticles. Here, the research focus has shifted from toxicological studies to the analysis of nanoparticles being used as carriers for drugs. This area is likely to increase further over the coming years. Consequently, analytical methods have also changed from using field flow fractionation to X-ray-based techniques such as XPS and XANES that describe the chemical composition of the particles rather than their size. Single particle ICP-MS for particle sizing is still an area of interest though.</p></div><hr/>

It follows on from last year’s review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> and is part of the Atomic Spectrometry Updates series.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2–6</span></sup></a></span>

        <span>Following on from the last review period, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) has been the technique of choice for most workers researching into the analysis of steels or iron products. This is certainly true for those describing automated and/or on-line measurements. This is because LIBS is easily automated, may not require lengthy calibration protocols, inflicts little damage on the sample itself and may obtain reliable data in a “stand-off” mode, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> may be employed on a production line where conditions may be inhospitable for humans. For studies investigating corrosion processes, X-ray-based techniques are still the most common.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A review paper was presented by Legnaioli <span class="italic">et al.</span> who discussed, with the aid of 95 references, <span class="italic">industrial applications of LIBS</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> Particular emphasis was made to the steel industry and to the characterisation of coal; although sections on the nuclear, pharmaceutical, building, mining, food, waste management and electronics industries were also present. Although far from comprehensive, the review does give the reader a taste of the capabilities of the technique.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">As with all sample types, <span class="italic">certified reference materials (CRM)</span> are of utmost importance because they provide the best way of assuring that quality data are produced. This statement is dependent on several variables, not least of which is that the CRM should be as closely matched matrix-wise to the samples under analysis as possible. A paper by Shehata <span class="italic">et al.</span> described an intra- and inter-laboratory approach for the certification of reference materials of low-alloy steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> Seven low-alloy steel reference materials were developed by the National Institute of Standards, Egypt. The homogeneity of the samples was studied using XRF and atomic emission spectrometry, and the results indicated that they were sufficiently homogeneous to establish traceability of measurement results. The materials were characterised by different laboratories and by using four independent analytical methods: gravimetry, XRF, optical emission and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The mass fractions of each analyte as well as their associated uncertainty were calculated using the weighted mean approach.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers have described the <span class="italic">LIBS analysis of steels for the C content</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9,10</span></sup></a> The paper by Sturm <span class="italic">et al.</span> used a compact passively Q-switched laser operating at 1064 nm, with a power of 0.6 mJ, a frequency of 1000 Hz and a duration of 5 ns and a hand-held spectrometer (of dimensions 110 × 80 × 21 mm) to collect the data.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> The spectrometer had a very limited wavelength range (188–251 nm), but had an instrumental broadening at the C 193.09 nm of only 36 pm. There was also a facility to introduce an argon flow so that sensitivity in the vacuum UV region could be improved. Calibration curves for C as well as Cr, Ni and Si were obtained using CRMs. A total of 39 samples were used in the study. Set A contained CRMs from reliable sources of pure iron, alloy steel and one cast iron. Four of the samples from set A were used to form sub-set B and were used for the broadening experiments. A third set, set C contained 15 CRMs that had very low C content, of which the lowest C content was 5.1 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This set was used to calculate the LOD. Initially, set A samples were used to form a calibration curve to &gt;2% C. Five replicate readings were made and the signal was normalised to the intensity of the iron ion wavelength at 193.1845 nm. Calibrations obeyed either linear or second order polynomial fitting with <span class="italic">r</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of greater than 0.98. The LOD was 34 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which although inferior to larger instruments, was still impressive. Overall, the technique was capable of discriminating between similar samples, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> stainless steels 304 and 304 L. The other paper, by He <span class="italic">et al.</span> determined C in steels using LIBS with a genetic algorithm and back propagation neural network models.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> Unfortunately, there is an Fe emission wavelength coinciding with the C wavelength at 247.86 nm. This means that interference is a probability during the analysis of iron or steel samples. In general, the C wavelength at 247.86 nm is more sensitive than the 193.09 nm line, and is therefore often preferred because it gives lower LOD. This paper proposed a method that used a genetic algorithm to help overcome the interference problem. Using the model developed, the root mean square error was 0.0114 and the linear correlation coefficient showed a significant improvement compared with that obtained without the algorithm. This led the authors to conclude that as well as being rapid and easy to implement, it was effective for the determination of C in steels and iron-based alloys.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">As eluded to above, calibration can be problematic for LIBS when analysing samples such as steels or iron alloys, because iron has a plethora of wavelengths in the visible and near UV region of the spectrum. Consequently, there have been several papers that <span class="italic">tested different methods of calibration</span>. Many of these have relied on a statistical correction to ensure optimal results are obtained. An example of this approach was presented by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used multivariate calibration models using a machine learning approach as well as univariate approaches to determine Cr, Mn and Ni in steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> These authors used 25 CRMs as “training” samples so that the model could be constructed. They then used a further four samples as validating materials, to ensure that the model was functioning correctly; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> to determine whether or not the calibration was adequate. Each sample was analysed 400 times and the average for each element in each sample calculated. The background was then fitted and subtracted for each of the elements in each sample. The regressions for the univariate approach were between 0.8796 (for Mn) and 0.9852 (for Ni), but these values improved to 0.9405 (for Mn) and 0.9996 (for Cr) once signal intensity normalisation to an iron wavelength was performed. For the multivariate approach, back propagation neural network was used; which yielded <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of at least 0.99969. This is a clear improvement over the univariate approach. Precision was also improved using the multivariate calibration. Two further examples from another research group were also published. In one by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span> interference during LIBS analyses was corrected for using an algorithm based on an iterative discrete wavelet transform and Richardson–Lucy deconvolution.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> The authors provided a summary of what the Richardson–Lucy algorithm is and then gave a stepwise guide to how to use it and supplemented the text with a flow diagram. The method was applied to the determination of Mn in iron alloys and to the determination of Fe and Si in aluminium alloys. For the analysis of the iron alloys, the regression without applying the method was 0.973, improving slightly when either the transform or the deconvolution were used individually. When both the transform and the deconvolution were used, the regression improved to 0.993. Similarly, the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) improved from 0.057 to 0.032. The results for the analysis of the aluminium alloy were even more striking, with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values improving from 0.816 to 0.985 and RMSEC improving from 0.101 to 0.041. The <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> value of 0.985 is a clearly significantly better than that obtained without the algorithm. However, there may still be room for further improvement. The second paper by this research group used an image quantitative analysis to overcome matrix effects during the determination of Ni in 17 stainless steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> The authors again discussed the experimental setup, how the algorithm works and what needs to be done to ensure optimal data acquisition. Another flow diagram was provided to aid the reader. Improvements to the <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> value (from 0.9833 for a conventional spectrum to 0.9996 using the algorithm), to the average relative error of cross-validation (ARECV, from 56.80% to 1.0818%) and to the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV, 15.93% to 0.9866%), were obtained. The authors concluded that their approach was very effective at providing an improvement to the quantitative performance of LIBS analyses. Another research group also used a plasma-image – assisted method to correct for matrix effects during LIBS analyses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> The authors used the re-arranged Lomakin–Scherbe formula to calculate the temperature of the plasma from the intensity of the emission from the wavelengths of interest. The area of plasma analysed yielded information on the mass of sample ablated. The authors applied their method to the determination of Cu and Mg in certified metal samples GSB 04-1661-2004 aluminium alloy and a range of cast iron samples (GBW 01131a–GBW 01137a). To show the broad applicability of the technique, Cr and Mn were determined in some pressed pellet samples (soils GBW 07408 and GBW 07446) and a rock sample (GBW(E) 070164). The <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values for Cu and Mg improved from 0.726 and 0.942 to 0.992 and 0.988 when the image assisted LIBS technique was used. Large improvements were also observed for the pressed pellet samples, where <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> improved from 0.364 and 0.098 to 0.975 and 0.98 for Cr and Mn, respectively using normal LIBS and image assisted LIBS. Improvements to average relative errors and RMSECV values were also observed for all analytes in both sample types. Sun <span class="italic">et al.</span> experienced problems when calibrating a LIBS instrument during the determination of Fe in an iron–zinc coating of galvanized steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> Although the method was suitable in terms of spot size produced (∼50 μm in diameter), the calibrations obtained using the Fe intensity alone was extremely poor, with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> of 0.7713 being obtained. When using the intensity ratio of the Fe 404.58 nm to Zn 468.01 nm lines, a significant improvement was observed, with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> improving to 0.9511. The root mean square error also decreased from 0.4832% to 0.1509%. The influences of laser fluence and elemental depth distribution were also studied. Since the Fe is not uniformly distributed in the coating, the laser fluence had to be sufficiently high to ensure that sufficient sample was ablated. A fluence of 170 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> gave the optimal results and was therefore used for the rest of the study.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Wang <span class="italic">et al. compared three quantitative analysis methods for the LIBS determination of Cr, Mn, Ti and V in steel</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> The three methods were single variable calibration, partial least squares regression and support vector regression. The partial least squares regression adds interference spectrum lines to the model to enable linear modelling. The support vector regression also adds interference spectrum lines, but enables non-linear modelling. All of the models were discussed at length in the paper. Both the partial least squares regression and the support vector regression gave better data than simply using the spectral intensity and concentration. However, of the three, the support vector regression model provided the best quantitative data, yielding <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of 0.995, 0.993, 0.992 and 0.990 for Cr, Mn, Ti and V, respectively. The root mean square errors of prediction were: 0.045, 0.044, 0.014 and 0.011 for the same analytes. In addition, it had virtually no elemental bias whereas the partial least squares regression and single variable calibration had different degrees of influence on the spectral lines.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Jia <span class="italic">et al.</span> devised the physical method of laser beam shaping for improving the calibration during the LIBS determination of Cr and Mn in certified steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> A Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, a 7 ns pulse duration, 1 Hz repetition rate and an energy of 50 mJ was used with a peak shaping lens placed in front of the focussing lens. This peak shaping lens transformed the Guassian shaped laser beam into a “top hat” shaped beam. This beam uniformity meant that there was less unwanted heating and therefore the crater produced was much flatter at the bottom and had smoother walls than that produced by the normal laser beam. This was shown using electron micrographs and other images. The intensity of Cr at the 425.43 nm line was ratioed to the Fe intensity at 283.16 nm line. Similarly, the Mn signal at 403.45 nm was ratioed to the Fe intensity at 404.58 nm. The data produced was then treated using the “leave one out cross-validation” protocol to calculate relative error, precision and RMSECV. These values were tabulated and showed clear improvements for both elements compared with the Gaussian laser beam using both the peak area and the amplitude. Similarly, the LOD observed for the “Top hat” laser were typically half those observed for the Gaussian laser beam.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers discussed the <span class="italic">analysis of alumina inclusions</span> in steel samples.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18,19</span></sup></a> In the paper by Imashuku and Wagatsuma, both alumina and magnesium oxide centre dot alumina spinel inclusions were visualised using X-ray excited optical luminescence.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> The technique is capable of rapidly identifying sizes, shapes and compositions of non-metallic inclusions in such samples and can be performed in air. A model steel sample was prepared by melting iron, aluminium and magnesium oxide powders together at 1550 °C in an argon atmosphere. Application of the X-rays made the alumina inclusions emit red (at 695 and 750 nm) and blue (at 380 and 485 nm) luminescence. After attaching a filter to the camera that blocked light above 650 nm, only the blue light was observed. In contrast, the magnesium oxide.alumina spinels emitted green light at 520 nm. Using the filter therefore enabled both species to be determined simultaneously over the wavelength range 420–650 nm. The sample was also analysed using SEM-EDS. The results of this were largely in agreement with those obtained using X-rays. In one area of the sample, that emitted red light, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it contained only alumina, the EDS showed the presence of both Al and Mg. This was attributed to alumina and magnesium oxide being present, but not the mixed alumina-magnesium oxide spinel. The other paper, by Matsuda <span class="italic">et al.</span>, reported the use of LIBS to detect alumina inclusions in stainless steel.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> A schematic diagram of the setup was given. The sample was placed on an XYZ stage and a Q-switched, high frequency, low energy (1 kHz and 1 mJ per pulse) Nd:YAG laser, operating at 532 nm was used to produce trough like craters in parallel lines, 50 μm apart, across the sample surface. The Al was detected at 396.152 and 394.403 nm, which are wavelengths that are not spectrally overlapped by iron lines. A histogram was therefore produced of the Al signal, where spikes indicate the presence of an inclusion. The method was rapid, with a 4.5 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> area (3000 × 1500 μm) being analysed in 20 min. This compared very favourably with the conventional method of counting the inclusions using optical microscopy.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Huang <span class="italic">et al.</span> described a <span class="italic">hybrid model combining wavelet transform with recursive feature elimination for running state evaluation</span> of heat-resistant steel using LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> The analytical data from LIBS underwent a chemometric transformation which was a hybrid of wavelet threshold de-noising and k-fold support vector machine recursive feature elimination (K-SVM-RFE). Fourteen samples, including four industrial samples obtained from a power plant boiler that had seen different extents and conditions of service, were analysed. The data first underwent an evaluation of the noise component, which was removed using the wavelet threshold de-noising. Then the K-SVM-RFE approach was applied to obtain the optimal feature subset and to build the classification models of aging grade and hardness grade. The assessment matrix obtained using the indicators from the aging grade and hardness grade was used to evaluate the running state of the steel.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A very interesting paper was prepared by Shin <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used <span class="italic">LIBS to improve the classification accuracy</span> of waste stainless steel alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> The scraps were placed on a conveyor belt and a laser shape sorter was used to identify a flat area fit for analysis. The scraps were then passed to the LIBS side of the operation that utilised a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, at 10 Hz and at 26 mJ; placed 70 mm above the conveyor belt. Light emitted from the plasma formed was detected using a dual channel spectrometer capable of operating between 200 and 430 nm with a resolution of 0.1 nm (channel 1) or between 415 and 900 nm with a resolution of 0.3 nm (channel 2). A charge coupled device (CCD) detector was used in both cases. A total of 17 wavelengths were used for the classification, of which seven were for Fe, six were for Cr, two were for Ni and then there was one each for Mn and Mo. A total of 16 line pairs were chosen to be ratioed. All of the Cr wavelengths were ratioed to different Fe lines, but other elements used different species to be ratioed with, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the Ni 352.4 nm line intensity was ratioed to the intensity at the 360.5 nm Cr wavelength. A table described the line pairings in full. The data so produced were then treated using principal component analysis (PCA) and checked using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Method validation was through the use of eight stainless steel reference materials. It was concluded that this procedure offered a low cost and efficient method that was suitable for industrial purposes.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Makino <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a new analytical method by which major and trace elements in low alloy steels, stainless steels and tool steels were determined using <span class="italic">a solid mixing calibration method and multiple spot LA-ICP-MS</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> The system used a high repetition rate laser and galvanometric optics; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> a device that can change the laser spot focus in the <span class="italic">X</span> and <span class="italic">Y</span> axis in a very short time period. The multiple spot laser system enabled two different sample types to be ablated almost simultaneously. Therefore, a sample could be analysed at virtually the same time as a reference material of known composition and then the aerosols combined prior to ICP-MS detection. A further advantage was that using a high repetition rate laser led to large quantities of material being ablated in a short time period. This means that improved signal to noise ratios were obtained. The analytes Co, Cr, Cu and Ni were determined in a total of 13 samples. The concentrations calculated showed good agreement with reference values (within 10%) even over very large concentration range, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> up to percentage levels. It was concluded that the methodology could become a powerful tool in the future.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One last laser-based application was presented by Luo <span class="italic">et al.</span> who <span class="italic">compared three different laser systems for ablation of steels into an ICP-MS instrument</span> for detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> The lasers were: a 257 nm one operating at 300 fs, a 213 nm Nd:YAG operating at 3 ns and an argon fluoride laser operating at 193 nm and at 15 ns. Under typical operating conditions, the signal intensity for the 257 nm laser was 10 and 3.6 times greater than that for the 193 nm and 213 nm lasers, respectively. The femtosecond laser also showed a greater signal stability compared with the nanosecond lasers. The different systems also showed significant differences in melting and elemental fractionation, with the 193 nm laser providing the worst performance. In contrast to this, once normalisation to the <small><sup>57</sup></small>Fe signal was undertaken, the 257 nm laser provided elemental fractionation indices close to one for most analytes, with no significant melting. In this work, NIST 610 glass was used as a non-matrix matched external calibration standard. The femtosecond laser enabled far more accurate results to be obtained when compared with the nanosecond lasers.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The corrosion of steels has received considerable attention. However, most of the papers in this area are very routine with respect to the atomic spectroscopy and hence will not be detailed in this review. An exception to this was published by Wongpanya <span class="italic">et al.</span> who studied the <span class="italic">corrosion of 1045 and J55 low alloy steels in crude oil</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> Since the crude oil can also contain sand, some was added in different concentrations with particle sizes ranging from 500 to 2000 μm. Therefore, erosion of the steel pipes was also studied. An impingement jet system was used to bring the steels into contact with the oil/sand matrix. The corrosion was measured gravimetrically thus giving a weight loss with units of mass per square area. The surface of the pipes were analysed using SEM and X-ray photoemission spectrometry (XPS). Both ICP-OES and electrochemical measurements were made on the oil to determine material leached/abraded from the steel surface. The Fe content of the oil as determined using ICP-OES showed that the 1045 steel had a much greater release than the J55 steel. It also had a greater depth penetration. The sand particles size had a significant effect, with larger particles causing much greater abrasion of the surface. Analysis of the oil for CHN as well as K, Na and Si was undertaken. It was found that the Fe(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)/Fe(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) was a useful indicator of whether corrosion or erosion dominated. A high ratio indicated better erosion resistance (more corrosion) whereas a low ratio indicated a better corrosion resistance.</p>

The authors first used gold nanoparticles of known sizes to determine the resolution of the separation using a sodium cholate dispersant. Careful optimisation was undertaken, including controlling the zeta potential of the particles to above −30 mV to avoid particle agglomeration and to ensure the zeta potential of the RC 30 kDa membrane was between −20 and −30 mV to prevent particle adhesion to the membrane surface. The steel samples were then decomposed using selective potentio-static etching by electrolytic dissolution. This dissolved the iron matrix but not the carbide particles. Using the RC 30 kDa membrane with a 1.16 mM sodium cholate dispersant, the authors identified particles of both TiC and VC that had a size of less than 5 nm.</p>

The storing matter SIMS method was compared with conventional SIMS and gave a better depth resolution and greater sensitivity. For steels that had been baked at 500 °C, the storing matter SIMS showed that Cr, Fe and Ni were uniformly distributed throughout the steel. However, conventional SIMS did not show this, instead indicating that there were hotspots of Cr and Fe. This disparity was attributed to the presence of matrix effects encountered during conventional SIMS.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect536"><span class="b_heading">1.2 Non-ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>This area has received significant amounts of interest during this review period. The analysis of copper-based, aluminium-based and nickel-based alloys have all received significant attention. Another common theme has been studying corrosion, either in an attempt to prevent it or to study the mechanism by which it occurs.</span>

          <span id="sect540"/><span class="c_heading_indent">1.2.1 Copper and copper-based alloys. </span>
          <span>One of the most common topics to receive research attention has been the <span class="italic">analysis of copper-based alloys.</span> An example of such an analysis was presented by Arnquist <span class="italic">et al.</span> who reported the development of a method to determine <small><sup>232</sup></small>Th- and <small><sup>238</sup></small>U in copper using ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> An automated, off-line matrix separation/analyte preconcentration method was developed in which the anion exchange resin AG 1X4 (100–200 mesh) was packed into a low-pressure chromatography system. This system was capable of cleaning the resin column, sample loading, matrix removal, analyte elution and collection with no input from the operator other than the initial programming. After pre-conditioning the column using 2 mL of 8 M HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, the sample digest (9 mL) was loaded onto the column at a reduced flow rate to ensure maximal interaction with the column. The matrix was removed by flowing through 0.5 mL of 8 M HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and the analytes eluted in 1.8 mL of 2% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>. A five-fold preconcentration was therefore established. Analyte eluates were collected in pre-cleaned vials ready for analysis. An isotope dilution methodology was adopted for the quantification. This led to the extremely low method LOD of 3.7 and 9.4 fg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> being obtained for the Th and U, respectively. The preparation procedure was not rapid, with the whole pre-conditioning, sample loading, washing and elution protocol taking just over 60 min per sample. However, since it was fully automated, this is less of a problem. Arcidiacono <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the use of a neutron-based quantitative method entitled time-resolved prompt gamma activation analysis (T-PGAA) for the analysis of copper-based alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> This is a relatively new, technique developed by the authors and undertaken on an instrument designed and built in-house. A high purity germanium detector maintained at 77 K was used to acquire both the photon energy promptly emitted by the irradiated sample and the time at which the prompt gamma ray is detected. The authors briefly described the process and the instrumentation. It is based on a radiative capture reaction where the incident neutron hits a target nucleus which becomes activated and then emits prompt gamma rays during the irradiation. The main advantages of the technique are that it is non-invasive and is sensitive for major, minor and trace analytes. The authors applied the technique to the analysis of certified brass and bronze samples. In general, agreement with certified values was good. However, there was a significant error observed for the determination of Zn in the bronze sample, where the experimental result of 0.01% was a huge underestimate of the certified value of 4.92%. This was attributed to the background subtraction method used.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The improvement in sensitivity for the determination of Pb in five copper-based alloys by using <span class="italic">double pulse resonance LIBS</span> (DP-RLIBS) compared with RLIBS was discussed by Tang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> For the DP-RLIBS, a beam splitter was used to split a tuneable laser into a transmission and a reflection beam. The reflection laser pulse was used to ablate the sample (similar to the front edge of the pulse in RLIBS) and the transmission beam was used to resonantly excite the atoms within the vaporised plume (similar to the back edge of the pulse in RLIBS). A detailed description of the instrumentation including a schematic diagram was given to aid the reader. Careful optimisation of the operating conditions in terms of laser wavelength (huge increase at Pb 405.78 nm when the laser was tuned to the resonance line 283.31 nm), laser energy and acquisition delay. The Pb signal increased with increasing laser energy, but the signal to noise ratio (SNR) decreased. The optimal delay time was in the nanosecond range, which is significantly shorter than traditional LIBS (μs range). Using five reference materials, calibrations were established for DP-RLIBS and two version of RLIBS. These two versions were: using the reflection beam (RLIBS-1) and the transmission beam only (RLIBS-2). The <span class="italic">r</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> value was 0.992, 0.947 and 0.859 for DP-RLIBS, RLIBS-1 and RLIBS-2, respectively. Similarly, the LODs for the three configurations were 9, 29 and 13 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, demonstrating the clear sensitivity and general performance enhancement exhibited by DP-RLIBS. Damage to the sample was also not significantly worse, with the diameter of the crater being 66 μm for the DP-RLIBS compared with the 62 μm for the RLIBS.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another LIBS-based application was reported by Jabbar <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used a <span class="italic">long duration single pulse version of LIBS</span> for the analysis of brass alloys that were submersed in water.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> A Nd:YAG laser was used at 1064 nm and with a pulse duration, frequency and energy of 100 ns, 0.05 Hz and 50 mJ, respectively. The experimental setup was described, again with the assistance of a schematic diagram. Reference brass samples were placed in a beaker of distilled water and the laser shot fired perpendicularly through the surface of the water. The beaker was on a rotating table to ensure that the laser did not sample from the same spot, so causing a deep crater. The water was changed every 50 shots to avoid contamination from the vaporised plume. Plasma parameters such as electron number density and plasma temperature were calculated and used to enable calibration-free, quantitative LIBS measurements. The spectral profile of the copper lines was investigated and was found to be severely affected by self-absorption in the underwater measurements. Two versions of the analysis were therefore tested – before and after self-absorption correction. Results after self-absorption correction were superior with the Cu data having better than 2.4% relative error to the certified values after correction compared with better than 4.4% before it. The Zn data were less impressive with one sample in particular (ZBY 926) yielding very poor data. The relative error for Zn after correction was 21.3% whereas before correction it was 49.5%.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A related technique to LIBS is <span class="italic">laser ablation spark-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LA-SIBS)</span>. Jiang <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the use of a high repetition rate fibre laser operating at 30 kHz and at 1064 nm to ablate samples and then a spark between a tungsten rod anode and the sample plate cathode excited the plume further so that light emitted could be detected.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> Optimisation of the ablation and excitation processes as well as the geometry and distance between the anode and the sample was undertaken. The system was tested using five standard copper alloy samples and the performance compared with that of just using the LA component. Use of the spark secondary excitation yielded sensitivity and LOD that were improved for Al, Fe and Pb at 396.15, 358.12 and 368.35 nm, respectively, by a factor of between 3 and 9. Using the combined system, the LOD were 106, 1022 and 1309 ppm for Al, Fe and Pb, respectively. Although not massively impressive, these LOD were better than those obtained using a standard LIBS system and, given that the device is portable, it offers several advantages. An extension to the work was published by Kang <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used a similar device in addition to a lock in amplifier and detector.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> In this study a high repetition rate Nd:YAG laser was used rather than a fibre laser. Therefore, a repetition rate of only 4 kHz could be obtained. The spark discharge extended the duration of the light emission to approximately 10 μs per pulse. The gated preamplifier used enabled the continuum background to be reduced significantly. The device was used to determine Al and Pb in brass samples and Cr and Mn in aluminium alloy samples. Detection limits were 178, 112, 235 and 202 ppb for Al, Pb, Cr and Mn, respectively, which were a factor of between 9 (for Mn) and approximately 70 (for Al and Pb) better than conventional LIBS.</p>

          <span>Another popular sample type has been aluminium and aluminium-based alloys. In an extension to the work above on LA-SIBS, Kang <span class="italic">et al.</span> analysed aluminium alloys for several analytes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> Again, a high repetition rate laser was used operating at 30 kHz was used for the ablation and this time detection was achieved using a compact fibre spectrometer in non-gated mode. The median filtering method was used to reduce the contribution of the continuum background to the emission signal. The electron density measurements were determined according to the Stark broadening of the atomic lines and Saha–Boltzmann plots indicated that the plasma temperature was 11<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>800 K. These two fundamental parameters were used to enable calibration-free quantification. Analytical error was less than 0.5% for the major elements, but up to 35% for minor analytes with concentrations up to 0.1%. A final paper of this type was presented by He <span class="italic">et al.</span> who determined Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn and Zn in aluminium alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> This time calibration curves were constructed and the setup yielded LOD of 4.4, 5.6, 8.3, 4.9 and 31.1 ppm.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have been published that have <span class="italic">utilised glow discharge (GD) with MS detection</span>. In one, Gonzalez-Gago <span class="italic">et al.</span> used GD-MS to determine impurities in three different matrices: aluminium, copper and magnesium. The paper explained the quantification models used for GD-MS and then went on to explain the experimental part of the work. Reference materials of the three matrices (four each for aluminium and copper and three for zinc) were used and the operating conditions in terms of argon flow rate, voltage and current were optimised for highest relative sensitivity factor for each. The voltage and current had only marginal effect, but the gas flow rate was critical, with the relative sensitivity factor changing by 40% over the gas flow rate range tested. Improved standard relative sensitivity factors were calculated when optimisation based on multi-matrix calibration was undertaken. Also presented in the paper was an attempt to use GD-MS as a method of determining O in the materials. The O was present as a result of the sintering process. The LOD was very poor (1.5–7.0 g kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), but this was dependent on the matrix. The worst sensitivity was obtained for the magnesium sample. The poor LOD was attributed to the high ionisation energy of O and the high background signal intensity. However, the authors acknowledged that further fundamental studies were required to test this. A paper by Pisonero <span class="italic">et al.</span> used GD-SF-MS in the pulsed mode for the multi-elemental (major, minor and trace) depth-profiling analysis of heat-treated zinc coatings on extruded aluminium.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> Parameters including the GD source design, the discharge conditions and the mass spectra acquisition conditions were optimised to obtain low sputtering rates, high mass spectra acquisition rates, high speed and improved depth-profiling resolution. Relative sensitivity factors did not change with the matrix when the GD was operated in pulse mode. This is important because the relative sensitivity factor is used to convert ion signals into elemental concentrations. Numerous reference materials were analysed and, as a further quality control method, the data were compared with those obtained using femtosecond LA-ICP-MS. The results were in reasonable agreement.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An interesting <span class="italic">forensic application</span> was reported by Nishiwaki and Takekawa, who discriminated between different aluminium automobile wheel fragments using the non-destructive technique of synchrotron radiation XRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> The samples comprised tiny fragments (less than 500 × 500 μm<small><sup>2</sup></small>) from 45 different kinds of wheels. Each sample was packed into polypropylene films, sealed and then placed in a sample holder with a 3 cm aperture. The XRF was undertaken using two different energy X-ray beams. These were 18 keV and 116 keV. For the 18 keV work, pairwise comparison was made between the analyte and Ga. This led to 10 analytes being determined with all except Fe having a precision of better than 15%. It was impossible to do a pairwise comparison with Ga for the data obtained using 116 keV because it was not detected in all samples. In addition, the Pb gave a large background signal because of the lead collimator in front of the detector. Samples were also analysed using SEM-EDS. A pairwise comparison of Mg/Al was successful and with a good RSD of 3.4%. However, other elements had a very poor precision and were useless analytically. It was therefore concluded that although the Mg/Al ratio obtained using SEM-EDS was potentially a good indicator, the overall results were not sufficiently reliable. The high energy XRF data enables an 82.9% success in identification. However, the data obtained using 18 keV was much more successful, with a 92.9% identification rate. Combined use of the data from the two different energies yielded an identification rate of 98.2%.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Vrabel <span class="italic">et al.</span> compared a high-end LIBS instrument with a low-cost one for their performance in <span class="italic">classifying aluminium-based alloys</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> The low-cost instrument comprised a Czerny–Turner monochromator with an integrated non-intensified detector that covered the range 190–1100 nm. The high cost instrument had an Echelle spectrometer covering the range 200–900 nm with an electron multiplying CCD detector. The alloys were analysed in two forms – powders or printed parts. Once the data had been acquired, the spectra were analysed and inserted into multivariate data analysis tools such as PCA and Support Vector Machine. The PCA was used first to reduce the number of variables required for analysis. It was found that 89% of the variability could be found in just four principal components. These four components were then passed to the support vector machine algorithm for further analysis. The results were impressive. The high-cost instrument correctly identified 100% of sample types in both printed part and powder forms. The low-cost instrument also performed well, with 94.7% of samples in powder and 100% in printed part form being correctly classified.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A LIBS-based application was reported by Gudmundsson <span class="italic">et al.</span> who reported the use of the technique at an aluminium smelter site to <span class="italic">determine 14 analytes in molten aluminium</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> Each measurement comprised 70 shots of a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, at 10 Hz and with an energy of 100 mJ.

Two series of reference materials were prepared. These were entitled the VZHM and the VKNA series. Each contained five separate samples of slightly differing composition.</span>

The vapour was transported to the plasma torch by a flow of argon (0.12 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) fortified with 9 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> carbon tetrafluoromethane to aid the volatility (particularly useful for analytes such as Cr) and 20 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> hydrogen.

This improved the stability of the plasma and led to enhanced sensitivity and lower LOD. Calibration was achieved by inserting different masses of the reference material NIST 2710 Montana soil. Clearly, this is not the ideal material in that is it not matrix matched to the sample. In addition, it is recommended that a minimum of 250 mg is used to ensure homogeneity. Despite this, the authors succeeded in calibrating even though less than 10 mg was used. The argon 415.859 nm line was used as an internal standard to account for sample loading effects on the plasma. The analytes determined were Cd, Cr, Mn, Mo, Pb, V and Zn.

Compared with the analysis of solid metal materials, very poor precision was achieved when metal powders were analysed. This was attributed to the low probability of the powder particle being ablated/vaporized by the central part of the laser beam. Two different calibration regimes were tested.

          <span>One paper described methodology to <span class="italic">determine the provenance of gold</span>, a task that is difficult but necessary to ensure a responsible supply chain.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> This paper, by Pochon <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the use of a commercial hand-held LIBS system to determine Ag in 13 samples of gold and gold alloys from five different areas of French Guiana. The small spot size of the laser enabled analysis of very small gold grains. Calibration was through the use of six commercial gold alloys with a Ag content of up to 16%. The authors studied different calibration models including univariate and multivariate (principle component regression and partial least squares regression). After normalisation against the signal from a gold wavelength, the quadratic univariate approach was adopted. Several wavelengths were monitored, but the 546.58 nm line was chosen for quantification because it provided the best sensitivity. Using the method developed, an <span class="italic">r</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> value of 0.99991 was achieved with a mean average error of 0.36% Ag for the prediction. Results were compared with those obtained using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), with good agreement being achieved. It was possible to distinguish between the different samples through the determination of the Ag content and this could be extended to even tracing the origin of unknown samples. The method was described as being very fast and easy.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers from the same research group described the technique of <span class="italic">laser ablation ionization mass spectrometry</span> for the depth-profiling analysis of tin–silver solder bumps.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44,45</span></sup></a> The surface and near-surface regions of the bumps are the most difficult to analyse because they are often rough and can accumulate contaminants from the plating bath. Such an approach should yield an in-depth understanding of the plating process. A laser with a pulse width of ∼190 fs and with a fundamental wavelength of 775 nm operating at its third harmonic (258 nm) was used for the ablation. Both papers used the reference material BCS 347 as a closely matrix matched calibrant and both discussed a novel 2D binning approach. The results obtained using the protocol discussed were compared with those obtained using ICP-MS. Results were similar, but the ICP-MS provided details of the composition of the bulk sample whereas the LA-ionization mass spectrometry could give detail with 10 μm lateral resolution. Two different sampling protocols were compared. In one, the single crater approach was adopted. This is where the same spot is repeatedly sampled. The other method used a layer by layer approach. This approach was discussed in detail in the publications.</p>

The ion to atom line intensity ratios were used as the basis of the analysis, with Mg being the analyte in the magnesium alloy and Cr being used for the steel sample. The experimental setup was described and the delay between the laser shot and the acquisition of data optimised. Successive shots of a Nd:YAG laser at the same point on the sample enabled different depths to be analysed. The depth was estimated using the position of the objective lens of a microscope. The authors explained how the data had to be treated to account for the different depths. The data obtained were compared with those obtained using XRD, with similar trends being identified; especially for those samples that had been stressed through bending. The authors did acknowledge that further work was required because the laser treatment also caused surface damage.</p>

        <span>A <span class="italic">review</span> containing 173 references highlighted the broad applications of atomic absorption spectrometry which have been driven by developments in designs of high-resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit47"><sup><span class="sup_ref">47</span></sup></a> Such instruments allow sequential as well as simultaneous multi-element analysis. In addition, these spectrometers are suitable for atomic and molecular absorption analysis utilising flame or graphite furnaces. The authors further summarised the developments concerning the analysis of solids, solutions, and liquid samples. The applications reviewed included biological objects, pharmaceuticals, oil and petrochemicals, water, dust and soil, cosmetics, polymers, fertilisers and plants. These applications were collated summarising analyte, matrix, LODs obtained and analysis conditions. A second review of interest summarised applications of LIBS for organic compounds (258 references).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48</span></sup></a> It provided an overview of the life cycle of organic plasmas and discussed the factors and mechanisms responsible for the features exhibited within the spectrum. In addition, different variables that influence the formation and expansion processes of organic plasmas are discussed and an in-depth summary about atomic and molecular spectral bands of organic compounds observed in LIBS was given. The focus of this review was with regards to emitting species. However, the importance of non-emitting species (for example CN<small><sub>2</sub></small>, C<small><sub>2</sub></small>N and C<small><sub>2</sub></small>N<small><sub>2</sub></small>) which can participate in the overall physio-chemical process was also discussed.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">It is essential to monitor the exposure to radioactive material by both nuclear plant workers and the general public. The long-lived <small><sup>129</sup></small>I isotope is an indicator for the long-term accumulation of radioactive iodine. The determination of iodine in general has several challenges. This is because of its high volatility, active chemical properties and the complex behaviour of iodine, resulting in iodine species often being lost during chemical processes. To overcome these challenges, an <span class="italic">extraction method of</span><small><sup><span class="italic">129</span></sup></small><span class="italic">I from charcoal cartridges</span> was developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> The charcoal cartridges had previously been used to collect gaseous emissions from the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories. An extraction system was derived, which consisted of a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask (reactor) connected <span class="italic">via</span> a low-density polyethylene tube to a 20 mL glass vial (collector). The reactor, which contained 0.1 g of the charcoal sample and a spike of <small><sup>125</sup></small>I, was located in a metal bead bath (85 °C). Once HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (10 mL of 68–70% v/v) was added iodine vapours were produced. By bubbling compressed air through the system (for 2 hours), the vapours were transported to the collection vessel, which contained AgNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (10 mL, 0.1 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). Consequently, an AgI precipitate was formed. A gamma counter was employed to measure the activity of the <small><sup>125</sup></small>I yield tracer both in the reactor and collector to calculate the I<small><sub>2</sub></small> recovery. In addition, accelerator MS was utilised to determine <small><sup>129</sup></small>I recoveries. The <small><sup>129</sup></small>I mass was compared with predicated values based on previous <small><sup>131</sup></small>I measurements which allowed the calculation of the minimum amount of <small><sup>129</sup></small>I expected in each sample. Recoveries ranged from 34–100% and 13–85% for <small><sup>125</sup></small>I and <small><sup>129</sup></small>I, respectively. In some cases, the substantial loss in recovery was associated with leaks in the system, variations in air flow rate and differences in absorption of <small><sup>125</sup></small>I by charcoal which will be further optimised in future studies. The developed simple procedure consisted of basic laboratory equipment, making it cheap and highly accessible. It would have been intriguing to see if preliminary experiments had been performed to optimise the extraction parameters such as the amount and type of acid used, the ratio of charcoal to <small><sup>125</sup></small>I spike, and the bath heating temperature. In addition to the extraction methods the possibility of directly determining <small><sup>129</sup></small>I in the charcoal powder from the collection cartridge was assessed. For this purpose, 10 mg of charcoal samples were mixed with 2 mg of <small><sup>127</sup></small>I carrier in the form of NaI solution and allowed to dry overnight (&lt;50 °C). To aid target stability Ag powder was added to dried and spiked charcoal samples (ratio 4<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1). This mixture was loaded onto copper targets and analysed in duplicate. The results showed large variations in replicate analysis, which was associated with sample inhomogeneity and needs to be overcome for future applications. The large variation in duplicate results made the comparison of the direct and extraction method more difficult. In addition, in multiple cases results obtained after extraction differed by an order of magnitude compared with those obtained after direct analysis. Nonetheless, future optimisation could result in a promising sample pre-treatment for <small><sup>129</sup></small>I determination. The main challenge that needs to be overcome will be that of obtaining representative samples from the charcoal filters.</p>

          <span class="italic">The analysis of explosives</span> is often needed in remote areas and in non-laboratory environments. Therefore, it is essential to develop analytical systems that are portable and robust that enable the rapid analysis of unknown samples <span class="italic">in situ</span>. A system was developed in which a Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 7 ns pulse at a power of 100 mJ) with a spot size ∼5000 μm was utilised for the identification of explosives.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> A Bi-concave (<span class="italic">f</span> = −10 cm) and a Plano-convex lens (<span class="italic">f</span> = 20 cm) were used to focus the beam onto the sample surface. Spectral emissions from the sample were collected using a single Plano-convex lens and transmitted to a non-gated spectrometer (350–1000 nm, resolution 1 nm at 500 nm) <span class="italic">via</span> an optical fibre (core diameter 600 μm, numerical aperture 0.22). To avoid transfer of the excitation source to the spectrometer, a notch filter was placed in front of the optical fibre. The signal could be maximised, by optimising the fibre position and lens selection for a brass sample. Standoff LIBS spectra were obtained at a distance of 6.5 m. The highest intensity was obtained when a lens with a focal length of 50 cm and a diameter of 10 cm was utilised. This system was applied to analyse 5 explosive samples as well as 19 non-explosives, which included common plastics that are known to interfere in identification of explosives due to their use in transport containers. Sample size permitting, up to 30 to 100 single laser shot spectra were acquired. To correct for background effects a fifth order polynomial fit by an iterative least square-based curve fitting algorithm (MatLab) was employed. Principal component analysis (PCA), two-dimensional scatter plots and the application of an artificial neural network (ANN) were compared for their ability to classify spectra obtained from both the explosive and non-explosive samples. Correct prediction rates of 99.83% and 94.18% were obtained when utilising the ANN approach for non-explosives and explosives, respectively with false alarm rates of ∼6%. It would be beneficial to assess if the stand-off distance of 6.5 m could be improved with further adjustments to the system.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">To <span class="italic">identify forgeries or to establish the order in which pen and toner lines have been applied to a document</span> could prove to be useful in forensic investigations. For this purpose, data obtained using MeV SIMS analysis in combination with results of particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) was applied to determine the deposition order of toners, inkjet inks and blue ball point pen.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a> The mock samples were created using different combinations of blue ballpoint pen, laser printers and inkjet printers. Utilising 8 MeV Si<small><sup>4+</sup></small> ions (lateral beam resolution ∼5 μm × 5 μm) samples (area 100 μm × 100 μm) were scanned initially far away from the ink intersection to obtained mass spectra. These were utilised to define each individual ink and toner in a first step. After this, the actual intersection area (1200 μm × 1200 μm) was scanned. Both measurements were obtained in pulsed mode with a beam current of 0.2 fA and a primary ion fluence of 2 × 10<small><sup>7</sup></small> ions per cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> resulting in a measurement time of 15 min. The obtained hyperspectral images were analysed using PCA, which enabled the identification of all samples except for those containing inkjet ink. These were further investigated using PIXE. The intersection regions (800 μm × 800 μm) were scanned utilising a 2 MeV proton beam with a lateral beam resolution of 5 μm × 5 μm, and a beam current of 80 pA. The primary ion fluence of 4.6 × 10<small><sup>13</sup></small> ions per cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> resulted in a measurement time of 10 min. In contrast to MeV-SIMS, which is a surface technique, PIXE obtains information from layers located at greater depth. The PCA of PIXE maps could help resolve some of the unidentified deposition order. However, it was not possible to distinguish all of the samples reliably. Further optimisation of the MeV-SIMS and the use of a wider range of inkjet inks in combination with other writing tools is to be the subject of further studies.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Similar to document fraud, <span class="italic">counterfeit bank notes</span> are commonly encountered by authorities. Assessing the topographical properties of bank notes might potentially help to distinguish counterfeit from genuine ones. A high resolution TOF-SIMS methodology was developed, which assessed the height distribution of a sample surface by monitoring one secondary ion and its spectral signature throughout the area under investigation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> Different heights result in varying time of flights for the secondary ions enabling topographical measurements. Bismuth clusters at 25 keV and an intensity of 0.09 pA were utilised to produce a pulse beam hitting the target at a 45° incidence angle. Secondary cations were collected at −2 keV. A microchannel plate in combination with a scintillator and a photomultiplier were utilised for detection. Sodium was chosen as secondary mass ion as it is found in the low mass region where the background is low. In addition, Na is considered to be a surface contaminant and so is present on most surfaces. The concept was proven by analysing a model consisting of two post-it notes that had been stuck together. Sodium ions detected from the upper layer reached the mass detector earlier than those resulting from the bottom post-it. The differences in TOF between the two peaks’ centre indicates distance between the areas of interest. The importance of experimental aspects such as changes in the extraction field, the presence of flood gun electrons, the extraction gap relative to the layers and the adjustment of the analyser deflection were discussed in detail. It was shown that the orientation of the topographic step relative to the primary ion and the flood gun beam did not influence its analysis. The optimum reflector voltage to obtain best mass separation, was between −60 and 0 V. The developed approach was applied to study the security feature of a 1000 Lebanese Lira bank note, the blue and green stripes created by intaglio printing as well as a Braille dot were studied. The average difference in TOF between the stripes was 3 ns. For the Braille dot it was noticed that due to its previous circulation more than two different height areas were detected. The difference between the dot and the upper left and lower left side of the banknote were 4 and 7.4 ns, respectively. In addition, a Franz Schubert–Fitaglio was assessed to determine height variabilities. Three layers were detected, the TOF difference between the first and second layer was 2.7 ns and was 7.3 ns between the first and the third layer. Results obtained were compared with measurements taken using a Schaefer optical profiler. A linear correlation was observed between TOF measurements (ns) and these height measurements in the range of 20–180 μm which shows that it is possible to utilise TOF measurements to quantify heights. Based on the difference between the peaks observed in the region of interest, the LOD was calculated to be 0.6 ns; equal to 1–2 μm. This is an interesting approach which could be useful in forensic investigations. However, the encountered matrix and experimental conditions need to be considered in detail. In addition, due to the nature of this technique it is only suitable for insulating samples.</p>

          <span class="italic">Chemical profiling has long been an important tool in forensic science</span> as it can, for example, help link illicit drugs to precursors used in their production. A common technique to achieve these determines the stable isotope ratios of drug samples by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). However, the availability of the required instruments can be a challenge for forensic laboratories. Therefore, assessing chemical information by other means could help overcome this. One example could potentially be LC-MS. This technique was investigated for its ability to determine abundance ratios of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> The abundance ratio of {M + 2H}<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion to [M + H]<small><sup>+</sup></small> was determined by selective ion monitoring in positive mode. Separation was achieved on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column and an isocratic separation utilising a mixture of acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium formate solution (6<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>94 or 15<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>85). For the determination of <span class="small_caps">D</span>-methamphetamine, trifluoroacetic acid was added to the mobile phase (0.05% v/v). The stable isotope ratio of ephedrine correlated to carbon and hydrogen stable isotope ratios previously determined by IRMS at <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> of 0.7902 and 0.8437, respectively. The analysis of ephedrine of known origin, used as precursors for methamphetamine showed good linkage between their respective abundance ratios. Furthermore, using LC-MS, it was possible to identify methamphetamine groupings based on ephedrine nature: synthetic, biosynthetic, and semi-synthetic. The developed method is by no means a substitute for conventional methods. However, it is a good way of obtaining useful chemical data for drug intelligence purposes based on a commonly used technique. Another facet of this paper was the determination of Sr using ICP-MS. The Sr was found only in semi-synthetic samples of ephedrine prepared from molasses and in biosynthetic samples. However, it was not found in synthetic samples made using pyruvic acid. This ICP-MS method was to be investigated further in future work, where the use of isotope ratios may help clarify further the origin of the drugs.</p>

It was used to determine many of the decomposition products from bodies (Ca, Fe, Mg and Na) in the carpets. Interestingly, when blank carpet values were subtracted, a Ca<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>Mg of 3.5<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 was obtained early in the decomposition process, whereas the Na concentration did not increase significantly. This was also an indication of early stage decomposition. The technique of GC-MS was also used to detect the presence of chloroform in the air or in the carpet. This too was an indication that a decomposing body had been present.</p>

        <span>A lot of the papers in this section this year were focussing on instruments that have been superseded with the adoption of ICP technology. Many contributions used AA, particularly graphite furnace techniques, with a lot of ‘reinvention of the wheel’. In industrial production and assessment labs the technology has moved on with the use of ICP-MS now being the ‘go to’ technique for low level analysis. Researchers are urged to evaluate the current techniques in use in industry for the analysis they wish to research (American Society for Testing of Materials (ASTM), Institute of Petroleum (IP), Universal Oil Products (UOP) methods) prior to undertaking a research project using AA technology as this is of little benefit to industrial settings and the instrumentation they are currently using. It was surprising how few papers were using ICP-MS in this topic when it is now a mature technique and used extensively in the field. This year the numbers of papers citing LIBS and coal seems to have dropped while those on the subject of crude oils seem to have increased. However, the quality of many of these methods for the analysis of oils was disappointing.</span>

The holders were placed inside quartz vessels containing 6 mL of an absorbing solution containing HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and HCl at various concentrations. After closing the vessels, they were placed on a rotor and pressurized with 20 bar of oxygen. The following heating program was used, 1400 W for 5 min followed by 20 min for cooling. Final solutions were diluted with water to 25 mL and the Se and Te determination performed using ICP-MS. This method produced a LOD of 0.002 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Se and 0.007 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Te. The results compared well with those obtained from the analysis of the same samples using microwave assisted wet digestion and ETV-ICP-MS detection.

By increasing the S valence state from S<small><sup>2−</sup></small> to S<small><sup>6+</sup></small> the intensity of satellite SKβ increased and in the pyrite spectrum the satellite SKβ is absent and the chemical shift of the SKβ<small><sub>1,3</sub></small> line energy is observed. The S valence state can be qualitatively assessed in ashes by comparison with the spectra of pure compounds, anhydrite and pyrite. The CRM SO-1 coal ash produced by the West Siberian Testing Center (Yekaterinburg, Russia) and CRM CTA-FFA-1 fine fly ash, produced by the Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology (Warsaw, Poland), were analyzed three times using both a certified titrimetric technique and the proposed XRF method (FeO content in the CRMs is not certified). The deviation between the results of the titrimetric and XRF determinations of FeO was less than 0.21 and 0.09 wt% and did not exceed that of the titrimetric method (0.25 wt%). Using the ratio of FeKβ satellite and FeKβ<small><sub>1,3</sub></small> line intensities provided less accurate results, but allowed semiquantitative determination of the FeO content in the ashes. The ratio of FeKβ<small><sub>5</sub></small> and FeKβ<small><sub>1,3</sub></small> lines intensities in contrast provided a good quantitative determination.</p>

          <span>There appeared to be more papers this year related to this subject however a large percentage were not new or novel. A number of examples described hugely long, complicated sample procedures and difficult instrument configurations only to replicate (usually with worse detection limits) standard ASTM methods that have been around for many years. Resources would be better targeted at ‘problem areas’, ‘difficult’ elements and ‘greening technology’ for which methods are badly needed. However, a number of papers were of interest. The first, by Garcia <span class="italic">et al.</span>, described a <span class="italic">method for the analysis of wear metals in used lubricating oils using a multi-nebuliser and standard dilution analysis with ICP-OES detection</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> The nebulizer used in this study was a multi-nebulizer (MultiNeb®, Ingeniatrics, Seville, Spain) which incorporates two independent liquid inlets into a single nebulizer body with a common nebulization gas inlet and a unique outlet orifice. The liquid streams are mixed at the tip of the nebulizer prior to exiting. In this analysis the used lubricating oil samples were diluted 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>10 with petroleum ether prior to analysis to reduce their viscosity. These samples entered the nebuliser through one nebuliser inlet and the other was used for the aqueous standard/internal standard addition. The sample is continually pumped through one inlet while the aqueous standard in the other is continually diluted with a blank solution. The internal standard, Y is used to quantify the standard dilution at points over time and this is used to calculate the standard concentration at those individual points. This is then used to construct a standard addition plot with many points, thus giving the unknown concentration in the sample. The continuous dilution of the standard was performed using the peristaltic pump that transports the solutions to the nebuliser. Limits of detection for this method for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Pb were 20, 10, 6, 20, 4, 30 and 200 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. Spiked lubricating oils analysed using this method produced recoveries of 91–108%. This is possibly a ‘greener’ approach to the conventional ASTM D5185 method, however it would be more time consuming.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The next paper in this section, by Nelson <span class="italic">et al.</span>, described a method for the <span class="italic">determination of Cl in crude oils by direct dilution using ICP-MS/MS</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> To avoid corrosion in refineries the concentration of Cl in crude oil feed stocks should be less than 1 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

All samples were shaken for two of hours in a mechanical shaker to ensure the samples dissolved in the <span class="italic">o</span>-xylene diluent. The calibration standards were prepared using different concentrations of an organic Cl standard in an <span class="italic">o</span>-xylene diluent.

Multiple calibration standards ranging from 1 to 1000 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were prepared by weight and the diluent was run as a blank. The LOQ for this method was 40 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the recovery of NIST 1634c at the two different dilution factors of 5 and 10 produced recovery values of 98.5% and 107.3%, respectively.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The paper by Oropeza <span class="italic">et al.</span>, described a <span class="italic">method for the analysis of asphaltenes using simultaneous LIBS and LA-ICP-OES</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> The LIBS was used for the determination of the major elements C and H while the LA-ICP-OES was used for the determination of Ni, S and V.

The precipitated material was washed using hot heptane before drying and weighing.

Preliminary results without a binder generated irreproducible ablation patterns which directly affected the emission signal. Following homogenization, the samples were then pelletized using approximately 7 tons of pressure. The LA was performed using a Nd:YAG laser at 213 nm. The samples were ablated at a repetition rate of 10 Hz while the sample was moved at a speed of 0.1 mm s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A five-line ablation pattern covering a 1 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> surface was found to produce the best sensitivity and precision while taking into consideration the strongly heterogeneous character of the sample. Signals were acquired in time resolved analysis mode for 3.5 min. The transient signals were integrated using the instrument software and C was used as an internal standard and to normalise the calibration curves. This compensated for matrix effects and variations in the ablation process. The LIBS signals for C and H were obtained simultaneously with the ICP-OES analysis. The H<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>C ratio gave information about the aromatic/paraffinic nature of the sample and complements the elemental analysis. A high H/C ratio (&gt;1.3) indicates a more paraffinic nature whereas low H<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>C (&lt;1.0) indicates more aromatic type compounds. Limits of detection by this method were 5, 100, and 0.5 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Ni, S and V, respectively. There was good agreement between LA-ICP-OES and analysis by conventional microwave-assisted digestion followed by ICP-OES analysis of a series of asphaltene samples. Similarly, LIBS values were also in agreement with elemental analysis using a routine combustion technique. This demonstrated that simultaneous LIBS and LA-ICP-OES analysis is an alternative atomic emission technique for the direct elemental analysis of asphaltenes.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Pereira <span class="italic">et al.</span>, described <span class="italic">an assessment of extraction conditions for the determination of Hg fractions in oily sludge samples using CV-AFS</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> The toxicity of Hg depends largely on its species. The toxicity level associated with organic Hg compounds is significantly higher than the toxicity associated with its inorganic species and Hg may bio-accumulate in living organisms. It is assumed that most of the Hg species in petroleum products are in the form of particulates, followed by dissolved Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> and elemental Hg with organic species (monoalkylmercury and dialkylmercury) at trace concentrations. Common methods employed for the extraction of Hg species were evaluated in this paper in terms of their efficiency towards the analysis of oily sludge samples. Convective heating using dilute HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> in a sealed vessel was demonstrated to be a simple, fast and inexpensive setup to carry out the extraction of ionic Hg. Multivariate optimization using a desirability function permitted the establishment of optimum extraction conditions. Despite the adoption of optimized conditions, the non-extractable fraction of Hg was substantial and likely associated with the presence of hydrophobic complexes, insoluble HgS and Hg0, which are of far lower toxicity and environmental importance than extractable ionic species. Overall, the developed method allowed the determination of very low concentrations of Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> with high sensitivity and precision when compared with more traditional approaches such as HPLC-ICP-MS.

The Hg in the atmosphere has toxic persistence and bioaccumulation effects which can cause harm to human health and the environment.

In this study an experimental system was used comprising an approx. 200 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> vacuum measurement chamber with 4 quartz windows perpendicular to the direction of laser propagation. The emission signal of the plasma was collected from a window of the chamber and focused on the entrance of an optical fibre and transmitted to the spectrometer. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was used operating at 1064 nm. Straight calibration lines were constructed using C as an internal standard. The Hg detection limit was estimated by evaluating the ratio of standard deviation of noise to the slope of the Hg calibration curve and was around 0.06 ppm (0.32 mg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small>) at a gas pressure of 10 kPa.

The oven temperature program of the GC was initially optimized for GC-FID with a single column connected to the FID detector. The optimized temperature program was then also used for the GC-ICP-MS analyses. The mixing of helium with hydrogen in the octopole reaction system of the ICP-MS instrument was found to be crucial to achieving high Si sensitivity, a low LOD and LOQ and a constant background signal over time.

        <span>A <span class="italic">review</span> containing 148 references summarised the developments in the analysis of toxic and potentially toxic elements in make-up articles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> Various analytical approaches in terms of sample preparation and analysis technique are generally applied. The most common ones combine conventional and microwave assisted digestion using concentrated acids and plasma-based atomic spectrometric techniques. Examples of these and other methods were summarised in terms of analyte of interest, sample preparation, analytical technique and limit of detection. In addition, trends and challenges encountered in this field were illustrated. It was noted that the method accuracy can often not be addressed due to the lack of available CRMs. A drawback of sample preparations involving concentrated acids is their incompatibility with the instrumental analysis. Consequently, high dilution factors and the resulting larger LODs are often encountered. To avoid this, digestion vessels can be pressurised with O<small><sub>2</sub></small> or H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> which minimises the amount of acid required by regenerating HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> during the digestion. Alternatively, microwave induced combustion and microwave-assisted ultraviolet digestion can be employed. A need for speciation analysis was identified because of the different toxicities associated with different elemental species.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Due to the complex matrices often encountered in personal care products, <span class="italic">sample preparation</span> is a crucial step that needs to be optimised prior to the analysis. To simplify the procedures involved, a total reflection XRF approach was applied to the analysis of lipsticks, eye shadow and body creams.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit71"><sup><span class="sup_ref">71</span></sup></a> In this study, since only a thin sample layer was deposited, matrix effects became negligible and concentrations could be calculated based on the internal standard added and the instrumental sensitivities for the different analytes. Preliminary experiments were performed to optimise the solvents, sample amount, deposition volume and drying mode. The best results for lipstick samples were obtained when utilising chloroform as solvent and Mo as internal standard. In addition, 5 min of sonication aided the formation of a homogenous suspension. The optimal deposition volume was 5 μL, which was deposited on quartz glass disc reflectors and dried at room temperature. Eyeshadow and body cream samples were treated similarly except that 1% Triton X100 was used as solvent, Pb as an internal standard and an IR lamp was utilised for drying. The method was not suitable for determining elements at concentrations below 1 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in lipstick. However, LODs were sufficiently low to allow general screening for legal thresholds. Since there is a lack of suitable CRMs, to assess the method’s accuracy, lipsticks and eye shadow samples were also analysed using ICP-OES and ICP-MS following a microwave assisted digestion. Good agreement was reached between data obtained using ICP analysis and those obtained using suspension-TXRF; even though precision values of 15–20% RSD were encountered. In addition, it was pointed out that Ba determination is challenging because of overlap of the Ba-L lines with K-line of Ti, which is often present in lipstick at high concentrations and should be the subject of future studies. Eye shadow results obtained by suspension TXRF showed an overestimation compared with ICP methods, indicating that the method is applicable only as a first screening tool and requires a normalisation process for quantification purposes. Applying the suspension TXRF method to a body cream CRM (CHEK RM 619) with certified levels of Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb and Se resulted in recoveries of 100 ± 15% for all but Cr, Hg and Pb. Mercury was not detected at all. This was attributed to its volatility and therefore it being lost during the sample preparation process. Lead concentration, on the other hand, was overestimated by 30%. The authors hope to improve this by employing a molybdenum X-ray tube rather than a tungsten one to achieve LODs lower by an order of magnitude for light-medium <span class="italic">Z</span> elements with K-line detection (Cr) and the high <span class="italic">Z</span> elements with L-line detection (Pb).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A vital aspect when analysing active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) within various formulation types is <span class="italic">overcoming matrix effects</span>. To enable the direct analysis of various low molecular weight compounds (180–325 g mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) a system utilising a microwave argon plasma torch for ion trap mass spectrometry was developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> The argon plasma torch consisted of a quartz tube through which argon flows at 100 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The torch was powered by a 100 W, 2450 MHz microwave power generator. Optionally, analyte particles could also be thermally released from a heated crucible, operated at varying temperatures (100–250 °C), and ionised by the microwave generated argon plasma. The system developed was applied to the analysis of various low molecular weight compounds, commercial tablets and molecularly imprinted polymers. Analytes were introduced into the crucible and heated to approximately 200 °C. The LODs and LOQs ranged from 0.002–0.005 μg and 0.006–0.0015 μg, respectively. The linear range was 0.008–3 μg for pure compounds and 0.003–10 μg for tablets and molecularly imprinted polymers. It was noticeable that accuracy and precision were not addressed, which would have been beneficial to assess the method’s performance. Nonetheless, this direct approach eliminates the need for sample preparation, saving time as well as avoiding the introduction of dilution steps.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A different <span class="italic">direct analysis approach based on LA-ICP-MS</span> of solid pharmaceutical materials was developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> Samples were analysed by coupling the ablation unit (ArF excimer laser, 193 nm) to the He mode operated ICP-MS instrument <span class="italic">via</span> Tygon tubing.

The obtained residues were dissolved in milli Q water and spiked to a placebo pharmaceutical matrix to obtain a stock matrix. This was diluted using the pharmaceutical matrix to obtain the additional concentration levels. Bismuth, In, Sc and Y were utilised as internal standards at a concentration of 10 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The lack of commercially available CRMs again proved problematic, with method validation having to be achieved using a separate multi-element stock. Acceptance criteria of United States Pharmacopoeia were met for linearity, accuracy (83–118% spike recovery at three different concentration levels), repeatability (1–12%), LOQ as 0.3× the target level. The developed method surpasses the need for time-consuming digestion and was shown to produce results comparable to those obtained using conventional ICP-MS and ICP-OES methods.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the field of pharmaceutical analysis, the need to meet legal requirements is often the main aspect to drive the development of new analytical methods. The EU Cosmetic Product Regulation No 1223/2009 requires nanomaterial-containing products to be labelled as such. Therefore, analytical methods that can assess the particle size and their quantity in cosmetic products are required. An example for such cosmetic products are sunscreens, which often contain the UV filter nanoparticulate titanium dioxide. The effect that sample preparation can have on these nanoparticles has been assessed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> The size of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles as well as their concentration was determined utilising asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) hyphenated with multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and ICP-MS instrumentation.

The three sample preparation approaches evaluated were: (1) ultracentrifugation in combination with hexane washing, (2) the thermal destruction of the matrix in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for ten hours and (3) an anionic surfactant assisted particle extraction and dilution followed by particle stabilisation. The performance of these three sample preparation methods was evaluated based on the Ti bulk mass recovery and particle specific recovery. Bulk mass recovery was best for method (2) at 104% followed by 87% for (1) and 72% for approach (3). Particle specific recoveries after size separation showed best recoveries for methods (2) and (3) at 91%, and a slightly lower result for method (1) of 83%. However, this still far exceeded previously reported particle recoveries of 50% when applying a superficial fluid extraction sample preparation step. Following suspension stability studies method (2) was deemed unsuitable since particle size increased by 8% and the corresponding change in polydispersity index (0.21 to 0.28). This further highlighted a change in size heterogeneity. In addition, the mode and width of the mass-based particle size distribution increased when samples were prepared applying method (1) and (2). Only the third approach did not lead to a significant alteration of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> particle sizes. Applying sample preparation method (1) and (3) to two sunscreen samples resulted in bulk mass recovery ranged from 77–88% and 89–95 for methods (1) and (3), respectively, demonstrating that these methods were capable of extraction the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The authors have pointed out that it was not part of the scope of this preliminary investigation to provide statistical data to assess the developed methods, hence no replicate analysis was performed. Nonetheless, the most promising method, method 3, is currently being assessed in an inter-laboratory study and will be fully validated at a later date.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An important field of study within the pharmaceutical industry is that of <span class="italic">drug release</span> as it is vital to fully understand this to develop an efficient drug. The release in long-acting injectable drug formulation (implant) has been assessed utilising LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> The API of the studied implant contains a fluoro-functional group allowing F to be used to chemically map the API. Utilising a 266 nm Nd:YAG laser with a 10 Hz repetition rate combined with a CCD detector, F LIBS spectra were acquired (685.60 nm atomic emission line) to quantify the API at predetermined time points equivalent to 25%, 50%, 75% and 95% theoretical API release. A thin slice from the middle section of the implant (∼100 μm thick) was placed directly into the helium purged (1 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) sample chamber. One laser point was utilised per location, 440 × 60 locations over a 2.2 × 2.2 mm area at a 35 μm spot size. The obtained spatial resolution was 5 μm × 36 μm. This provided a unique direct spatial visualisation of the API within the implant during its <span class="italic">in vitro</span> release. A dissolution gradient was observed at the interface between the centre of the cross section and the outer surrounding ring of the cross section. These spatially resolved images showed that the API release begins from the outermost regions, and a dissolution front progresses uniformly towards the implant centre over time. The vertical spatial homogeneity was also assessed at five different points (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 cm from the left end of the implant), which showed a relatively even distribution for all points. The results obtained using LIBS compared well with those obtained using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.9866). This method is a very useful tool to illustrate API release from long-acting injectable drug formulations and can be beneficial to highlight issues, should unexplained behaviours be observed in drug dissolution studies. Moreover, drug release modelling tools could be developed based on these imaging results.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In a similar approach, <span class="italic">TOF-SIMS was applied to study the depth profile of the oral drug delivery films</span> Naloxone and Buprenorphinel.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> The TOF-SIMS system utilised a 15 keV Bi<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> liquid metal ion source and an argon gas cluster primary ion beam. Sputtering was limited to 70–80 μm while scanning both sides of the film. Naloxone was found to be uniformly distributed, whereas the buprenorphine intensity varied as a function of depth. By dissolving the films in ultra-pure water, a matrix matched ink for printing was created at various concentrations of buprenorphine and naloxone. These calibration standards were analysed to assess if the method could be used for quantification purposes. The correlation between integrated depth profile ion intensity and printed mass was good with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.9963 and 0.9977 for buprenorphine and naloxone, respectively. However, the concentrations determined experimentally did not compare well with the stated dose of the film. The authors attributed this to the small analysis volume used and it would be worth investigating if this can be improved. It is pointed out that currently the technique is useful to visualise and size APIs, however, accurate quantification remains a challenge due to the small sample volume and the heterogeneity of the samples in terms of particle size, shape and spatial distribution. Nonetheless, being able to visualise API <span class="italic">in situ</span> without the need for markers or sample preparation is highly beneficial for the pharmaceutical industry (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</p>

        <span>This has been a popular area of research during this review period. The most popular area of research is that of classification of different polymer types for re-cycling or for forensic purposes. Many of these papers also employ chemometric tools on the analytical data to aid the classification.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">One review paper</span> pertinent to the analysis of polymers has been published by Alqaheem and Alomair.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit83"><sup><span class="sup_ref">83</span></sup></a> The review, entitled “Microscopy and Spectroscopy Techniques for Characterization of Polymeric Membranes” contained 153 references and covered microscopy techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), SEM and TEM. In addition, spectroscopy techniques such as XRD, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), FTIR, XRF and XPS were also discussed. Both SAXS and WAXS can provide crystallographic data as well as information regarding pore size distribution and particle size whereas the XPS and XRF provides information on the chemical composition. In the review, each of the technologies is discussed in terms of operation, limitations, sample preparation requirements and data interpretation. The review gives an easily understandable account of each technique while using a good number of clear tables and figures. A second review paper discussed the use of LIBS for the real-time analysis of trace surface contamination of polymers and composites.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84</span></sup></a> This review, by Ledesma <span class="italic">et al.</span> contains 53 references and discussed the capabilities of different LIBS systems, including μ-LIBS, the use of different laser types and the duration of the laser pulse. The limitations were discussed as were the future prospects.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Numerous authors have discussed the use of <span class="italic">atomic spectrometry to classify different polymer types</span>. The most common technique used was LIBS, usually in conjunction with a chemometric analysis of the data. An example of this approach was presented by Junjuri and Gundawar who used femtosecond LIBS followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the polymers polystyrene, low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> The authors collected data from two areas of the spectrum; 220–450 nm and then from 450–800 nm. The first region contained emission wavelengths of C (247.85 nm) and three bands from the CN radical (385.13–421.61 nm). The second region contained emission lines from H, N and O as well as the Swan bands. Two dimensional scatter plots were first plotted and these showed good segregation abilities, although there were some overlaps (for instance, C and CN, C and C<small><sub>2</sub></small> and between C<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CN) – especially between LDPE and HDPE. The authors then used PCA and ANN on the same species as well as emission data from Ca, K, Mg, Na and Ti. The PCA showed an excellent segregation, although there was a very small overlap between LDPE and polypropylene. The ANN was even more successful, with 99.5–100% of the samples being correctly classified in less than five minutes. A second paper by Junjuri <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the use of LIBS for the analysis of “post-consumer” plastics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> After obtaining the analytical data for the same analytes in the paper above from 10 different types of plastic, they used several statistical tests on them. These included correlation analysis and ratiometric analysis. The most successful of the tests used was partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). This managed to identify nine of the plastics with a success rate of over 90%. However, identification of polycarbonate was slightly less successful, with a rate of only 87.2%. It was still concluded that the approach could potentially be used routinely. Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span> presented a paper using LIBS to analyse and classify polymer materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> The analytical data obtained from the analysis of 20 plastic bottles was treated using spectral windows based on the algorithm continuous wavelet transform, and then inserted to PLS-DA. A full description of continuous wavelet transform is beyond the scope of this review, but briefly, it is a non-numerical tool capable of providing a representation of a signal by letting the translation and scale of the wavelets vary continuously. In the application described here, it was used to identify peaks in the LIBS spectra and then evaluate the detection performance. A longer description was presented in the paper. Use of the continuous wavelet transform reduced the influence of noisy variables on the classification results, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it removed parts of the spectrum that are analytically useless. It also overcame many of the problems associated with manual data processing and enabled easy automation of data handling. When combined with the PLS-DA, itself a simple and stable multivariate analysis technique, a very powerful classification tool was obtained. A step by step guide of the process, including the training protocols for the model, was given. The method was compared with PLS-DA without the use of spectral windows and with the classification tools Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. The spectral windows PLS-DA was the most successful of the classification techniques, with a rate of 93.93% being obtained, compared with 67.5% for the standard PLS-DA, 76.07% for Support Vector Machine and 57.15% for Random Forest. Another advantage claimed was that of speed. Only 10.1155 s to form its spectral windows was required and this only needed to be performed once, so no further calculations were required for the model. Another paper to use LIBS for re-cycling/classification purposes was presented by Costa and Pereira<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> who attempted to discriminate between three types of polyethylene (low and high density and re-cycled). The LIBS spectra were collected over the range 186–1042 nm, yielding 12<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>288 variables. These data were then pre-processed using mean centering prior to using Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) to calculate the inter-class distances between the three types of polyethylene. Once this had been undertaken, PCA was used for the classification. Twelve normalisation modes were tested to help overcome problems associated with variations in the sample surface, the stability of the laser and the interaction of the laser with the sample surface. These 12 modes were discussed in detail and provided similar performance, with inter-class distances of between 5.5 and 7.5 being obtained. The authors averaged the 15 laser shots per sampling position and then normalised the average. This was because of the simplicity of the calculations. Once all of the normalisation had been applied, the PCA classification of the three types of polyethylene achieved a very clear segregation. Another paper to use LIBS to collect analytical data prior to chemometric analysis to classify polymers was presented by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89</span></sup></a> Four types of plastics were analysed and seven chemometric methods (artificial neural networks (ANN) classification and regression tree (CART), k nearest neighbour (kNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), PLS-DA, support vector machine (SVM) and SIMCA) were tested. A brief description of each of the packages was provided, as was a description of the five data pre-processing methods that were also compared. Overall, 199 molecular and atomic emission lines were used for the analysis including C, CN, C<small><sub>2</sub></small>, H, N, O and the metals Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Na and Ti. The best data pre-processing method was Standard Normal Variate, although autoscaling, mean centering, normalising by the total area and normalising by the maximum also worked to lesser extents. Overall, the ANN along with the standard normal variate pre-processing provided the best performance, although LDA and PLS-DA also provided good classification.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Other techniques have also been applied to obtain the atomic spectrometric data. Among these is a paper by Tuccitto <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used <span class="italic">TOF-SIMS along with a probabilistic artificial neural network</span> classifier to classify four plastic types.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit90"><sup><span class="sup_ref">90</span></sup></a> Data were obtained using a Bi<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> beam at 25 keV. The training of the model involved the analysis of 50 samples of each polymer type and an additional 100 spectra obtained from other polymer types. The testing part of the methodology included obtaining 150 spectra (30 from each of the four polymer types of interest and 30 from the “other” polymers). Overall, a mis-classification of 11.7% was achieved, with most of those (7.5%) arising from non-distinction between polyethylene terephthalate-<span class="italic">co</span>-isophthalate and polymethylmethacrylate and the remaining 4.2% mis-classification arising from confusion between polystyrene and polyalphamethylstyrene. Classification was very rapid and required very little computer processing capability.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting forensic application was reported by Gupta <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used <span class="italic">LA-ICP-MS to analyse different electrical tapes</span> for 18 analytes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> A total of 90 different tapes that were known to come from different sources were analysed and the <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb signal was used to transform the data. The 18-dimensional data was transformed so that the scale of the signals was altered and the transformed data had similar characteristics to a normal distribution. The transformed data were then input to PCA which decreased the number of variables (the principal components) to five. The likelihood ratio gave extreme values, indicating that it is unreliable and should not be used in court. However, using an established <span class="italic">post hoc</span> calibration procedure, the likelihood ratios obtained fell within an acceptable range. Using the first five principal components, 97% of the data variability was accounted for and the error rates were very low (3.65% false inclusion and 2.22% false exclusion). Although this on its own is unlikely to lead to a conviction, it is still compelling evidence. Further work was envisaged to improve the methodology further.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There have been several papers that <span class="italic">described different or novel methodologies</span>. An example was presented by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used LIBS to quantify toxic elements (Cr, Hg and Pb) in polypropylene samples and then used Random Forest Regression based on Variable Importance to extract as much information from the analytical data as possible.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> Usually, the chemometric method Random Forest Regression, is used to classify polymers and other materials, so for it to be used in a full quantification is unusual. Random Forest Regression based on Variable Importance is a robust technique that has a good tolerance to noise and consequently does not suffer from the phenomenon of “over-fitting”, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it does not adhere too rigidly to a particular set of data (often the training data) and so fails to fit additional or “test” data. As above, data pre-processing was used with mean centering and normalisation being used to improve the performance of the Random Forest Regression. The model was compared with partial least squares regression and Random Forest regression without the Variable Importance input. The newly proposed model had the lowest root mean square or error and the highest correlation coefficient, demonstrating its applicability.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting paper from Aidene <span class="italic">et al.</span> used <span class="italic">EDXRF to determine C, H and O in plastics</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> This a novelty because the large majority of commercial spectrometers cannot determine analytes with an atomic number less than that of Na. The authors analysed 40 samples comprising 13 different polymers using an instrument equipped with a rhodium anode X-ray tube. Two sets of spectra were obtained per sample: the “light” (15 kV) and the “heavy” (50 kV). These were then split into four datasets: spectra covering the energy range 0–15 keV and the scattering region of the “light” channel (2.6–2.9 keV) and the analogous ones for the “heavy” channel (0–40 keV and 17.7–23.6 keV). The data were mean centered before processing and partial least squares regression and PCA were used to visualise the data. In general, the PCA did a reasonable job in classifying the polymers, especially for the light channel spectra; but was confounded by elements present in the samples as additives and colourings. The PLS was more successful, but it too suffered from some problems. For instance, the <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> value for C content over the range 38.43–85.62% ranged from 0.67 to 0.86, again with the “light” channels providing better data. Despite this, the authors concluded that the methodology had potential for further use in classification of polymers. In addition, the study could be extended to include the determination of N.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In recent years, significant research has gone into single cell- and single particle-ICP-MS measurements. This is especially true for nanoparticles. However, that technology has been transferred and so Bolea-Fernandez <span class="italic">et al.</span> have reported the use of <span class="italic">single event ICP-MS analysis of micro-polymers</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> The dwell time was set at 100 μs and a high efficiency, low flow nebuliser was used with an uptake rate of 10 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Standards of metal-containing polystyrene beads (2.5 μm diameter, doped with lanthanide ions) was used for the method development. In addition, no-spiked beads of 1 μm diameter were also used. Both types of beads were diluted with ultra-pure water to ensure that double strike events were minimised. The particle size distribution was measured by monitoring the C-13 signal and this was compared with the data obtained using the Ho signal arising from the metal-doped microparticles. Agreement for the number density and for the transport efficiency was good. Despite the encouraging data, the authors warned that before the technique could be used routinely, standards of known size and calibration methodologies would have to be developed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Grunberger <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported a <span class="italic">LA-spark discharge-Optical Emission Spectroscopy</span> method for the analysis of several sample types including human finger prints, mesoscopic layered samples and micro-patterned polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> In addition, certified materials such as aluminium, titanium, titanium alloys, molybdenum and tungsten were also analysed. A schematic diagram was provided in the paper, but essentially a Nd:YAG laser and a spark from a tungsten electrode placed 1–5 mm above the sample were used to initiate a plasma from which emitted light was transmitted through a fibre optic to either a Czerny–Tuner or an echelle spectrometer. The laser shot triggered the spark with the delay lag being dependent on the distance above the sample surface the electrode was. Best performance and optimal spatial resolution was achieved when the laser spot size, the pulse energy and the spark gap were minimised. A useful table was provided that compared the performance of LIBS, Spark-OES and LD-SD-OES. Spatial resolution for the new technique was approximately 100 μm, which was comparable to the other techniques. However, it was noted that emission lines from higher ionisation states, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> those with a double charge, could only be detected using the LA-SD-OES technique.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There are a number of relatively <span class="italic">simple applications of interest</span> that should be reported. This includes a LIBS analysis in which the type and quality of high voltage outdoor insulators were analysed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> The insulation efficiency decreases with age because of environmental, electrical and mechanical stresses. A rapid, reliable and non-destructive method of analysis is therefore required to minimise time where the power is shut down. Both standard and remote LIBS experiments were undertaken. The standard LIBS setup involved laser pulses from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm exciting the sample and then light emitted travelling through a fibre optic to a Mechelle spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD detector. The remote LIBS system was basically the same but with a portable spectrometer. In pristine samples, there were distinct peaks for C, CN and Si. However, in worn insulators, other elements originating from their environment, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Al, Ca, Fe Mg, Na and Ti were clearly detectable, with the signal being proportional to their age.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Fatunsin <span class="italic">et al.</span> estimated children’s exposure to hazardous <span class="italic">brominated flame retardants in plastic toys</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> These authors used a portable XRF instrument that had first been tested on some proprietary standards to ensure accuracy. The instrument was placed as close to the sample as possible with signal being measured for 60 s. The thickness of the material was corrected for if it was very thin. The LOD was 5 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The XRF was used as a screening tool that identified whether or not a sample contained Br. Those that did underwent further analysis that involved an extraction followed by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry to identify and quantify individual Br-containing compounds. Although this is a very simple application, it does demonstrate how useful and quick portable XRF can be as a screening tool.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another simple application was presented by Henn <span class="italic">et al.</span> who described an <span class="italic">online microwave-assisted solid sampling system for polymers</span> followed by flame furnace AAS detection for the determination of Hg in polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> Four polymers (polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, high density polyethylene and polyvinylchloride) were analysed. The system used was described in detail including a schematic diagram. The sample (3 mm × 3 mm) was mixed with cellulose wetted with ammonium nitrate solution, placed into the device, ignited in a stream of oxygen and then the Hg determined. The system was optimised with respect to the oxygen flow rate (0.6 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), mass of cellulose (20 mg), volume and concentration of ammonium nitrate solution (20 μL of 6 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), position in the system (just in front of the waveguide) and sample mass. A quartz T-piece on a burner head of an AAS instrument enabled detection. The design of this was also optimised, with one that had no holes and no slit in the under-side being optimal (gave the lowest characteristic mass). The flame conditions were also optimised. The method was validated through the analysis of the reference materials European Reference Material ERM EC 680K and ERM EC 681K low density polyethylene, with good agreement with certified values being obtained. The LOD was 0.2 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. It was concluded that the device was very successful and is portable and could therefore be employed with numerous spectrometers.</p>

This was thought to be an advantage in that they do not require an acid digestion that would be required for ICP-OES analysis. There is therefore less chance of workers becoming contaminated with radioactive material. For the DC arc-OES analysis, the gloves were incinerated, homogenised, loaded onto electrodes and then excited using the arc. The two techniques had similar detection limits with the EDXRF values ranging between 20 and 40 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> whereas the DC arc-OES had LOD of typically 5–20 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with a few analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> B, Be and Cd being significantly better (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 0.1 or 0.2 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). There was a significant difference in precision though; with the DC arc-OES providing values of typically 15–25% RSD whereas the EDXRF had a precision of &lt;10% RSD. Results for those analytes that were above the LOD for the two techniques were in good agreement, with differences rarely being greater than 10%.</p>

        <span>Interest in the <span class="italic">combination of LIBS and chemometric data analysis</span> for sample classification is rapidly growing in multiple fields, and the analysis of fertilisers is no exception to this. In one example, LIBS in association with partial least squares regression was developed for the rapid determination of P in compound fertilisers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> Samples were milled and pressed into 25 mm pellets for analysis and LIBS spectra collected over the reduced wavelength range from 210 to 260 nm, which contains the most intense P emission lines.

Correlation between the LIBS predicted value and that determined by ICP-OES was 0.946, indicating good correlation between the two test methods.

        <p class="otherpara">Handguns, with centrefire ammunition, are the firearms most commonly associated with crime. It is for this reason that GSR studies predominantly focus on the detection of the elements Ba, Pb and Sb, which are associated with the primer materials of this type of ammunition. However, interestingly, in Australia the predominant illicit firearms are small calibre, long rifles which use rimfire ammunition that does not contain antimony, allowing them to only be classified as ‘consistent’ with GSR under the ASTM guidelines.

Several measurements were made by rastering a 5 × 5 μm area revealing unique fingerprints in the glass from different ammunition suppliers. Furthermore, the composition of glass fractionator was found to be stable during firing, which raised the possibility that chemical testing of the glass in GSR may be used to identify the ammunition from which the residue was derived.</p>

The paper also provided a comprehensive protocol to test these assumptions. The deduced compositions using CF-LIBS were in agreement with results obtained by a range of techniques including PIXE, EDX, XRF and LA-TOF-MS. Jia <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the use of a flattop laser, rather than the standard Gaussian profile, for LIBS analysis of cement.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> A nanosecond Q-switched Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser was transformed to a flattop profile with uniform intensity by introducing a beam shaping diffractive element next to the focus lens.

        <span>In accordance with many other sections, the ceramics of cultural heritage origin have been moved into a separate section. This has therefore led to a significant decrease in the number of papers cited in the current section. However, the papers that do still qualify have covered several interesting topic areas, including LA in liquid followed by ICP-MS detection, slurry sampling followed by ETAAS detection and various X-ray-based characterisation techniques. Since ceramics are resistant to high temperatures and are notoriously difficult to dissolve, the techniques described have normally involved the direct analysis of solid materials.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Furuta and co-workers have produced two papers that have discussed different applications of <span class="italic">LA in liquid with ICP-MS detection</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">154,155</span></sup></a> The paper by Hirosawa and Furuta used the technique to determine a suite of elements in a single crystal of gallium nitride.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> A 340 mg crystal of material was inserted to a chamber and water added so that the depth between the water surface and the surface of the crystal was 3 mm. A Nd:YAG laser was then fired at the crystal for a period of 70 minutes over an area of 4 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small>. The water containing the ablated material was then collected and analysed using dynamic light scattering to determine particle size and SEM-EDX for trace element determination. In addition, the suspension was also transferred to a container and nitric acid added. After dissolution on a hotplate and dilution, the digest was analysed using ICP-MS. Since such an easy dissolution was possible is evidence that the ablated material had transformed from gallium nitride to gallium oxide. Preliminary results indicated that the crystal was not homogeneous. Therefore, the authors made four collections from the same crystal and then combined them before again splitting it into four aliquots for digestion. In addition, the analytical uncertainty was also poor. This was rectified by determining the Ga present in the ablated samples and then using that as an internal standard. The procedure was validated by the analysis of NIST 610, a standard glass sample, although the weight of material and the volume of water used as well as the dissolution procedure was different. The analytes Cd, Ge, Mg and Y were in the crystal at concentrations of between 0.1 and 2 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The paper by Fujiwara <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LA in liquid as a sampling method for silicon carbide prior to analysis using SF-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">154</span></sup></a> Microwave dissolution using a mixture of nitric, hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids was used on the ablated material. External calibration was used for most analytes although isotope dilution (ID) was used for the determination of Ti. Again, relatively poor precision was observed for those analytes using external calibration, although expanded precision values were better than 10%. The ID methodology using a 10 ms measurement interval improved this to 3.4%. The full methodology was given as an easily understandable flow diagram in the paper. Method validation was achieved using NIST 610, 612 and 614 glasses and the National Metrology Institute of Japan ceramic samples NMIJ 8001-a and NMIJ 8002-a.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two interesting papers have discussed <span class="italic">mechanistic aspects of processes that ceramic materials undergo</span>.

Other techniques used for the characterisation were grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and focussed ion beam (FIB). The coating started changing colour within a few seconds of the oxidation starting and for the colour to be different over the whole surface within 10 minutes. The GI-XRD and XPS data indicated that aluminium and chromium oxides started forming after one minute and then after 10 minutes, Cr–W and Co–W oxides started forming. The N content decreased within the first few seconds of oxidation starting and had disappeared completely after 10 minutes. The O content showed the opposite trend. A paper by Hostasa <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LIBS to monitor the evaporation loss of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from transparent YAG ceramics over the course of the fabrication process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> After milling and pressing, the samples containing silica over the concentration range 0–0.275% were calcined in air at 600 °C and then sintered in a vacuum at 1735 °C for 16 hours. Finally, annealing occurred with two different methods being tested. In one annealing was at 1100 °C for 100 hours and the other at 1300 °C for one hour. The silica was added in two forms, silica soot and tetraethyl orthosilicate. During the analysis, 10 spectra were obtained from the same location to improve the signal to noise ratio and the signal at the Si line at 288.158 nm was ratioed to the Y line at 288.654 nm. The detection limit was 0.0017% silica (8 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Si). More than 80% of the silica evaporated during the sintering stage under vacuum. This was attributed to the formation of SiO under a low partial pressure of oxygen.</p>

Sample (10 mg) with particle size of less than 25 μm was then mixed with nitric acid and Triton X-100 dispersant and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath. The suspension was then analysed using ETAAS. Central composite design was used to optimise the sample preparation in terms of the concentrations of the nitric acid used to leach the ceramic and of the Triton X-100 and the sonication time used for the extraction. Instrumental operating conditions were optimised using standard pyrolysis/atomization curves for each analyte. The results from the slurry sampling ETAAS were compared with those obtained using an acid decomposition technique which involved the use of concentrated nitric and hydrofluoric acids and then placing it in a sonic bath at 40 °C for 2 hours. The digest was then diluted to 10 mL before analysis. Results from the two preparation methods were similar, as demonstrated by a paired <span class="italic">t</span>-test. The slurry sampling method provided precision values of 6.9, 2.1 and 4.1% RSD for Cd, Cr and Pb, respectively. These values are good considering the small sample mass used. Spike/recovery experiments yielded values of between 90 and 111% (<span class="italic">n</span> = 3).

        <span>As with other sections, the analysis of glasses associated with cultural heritage have been moved to their own section. This has made the glass section smaller than usual. Many of the applications of the analysis of glass have involved the use of chemometric treatment of the analytical data. This was for either forensic purposes or for classification of materials prior to re-cycling. There have also been a few interesting applications, including one that used LIBS to measure the surface hardness.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">As always, the <span class="italic">development of CRMs</span> is necessary since they can be used to help method validation and ensures that instrumental drift can be monitored. A paper by Wu <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the preparation and characterisation of three synthetic Andesite reference glass materials entitled ARM-1, ARM-2 and ARM-3.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> They were made through the direct fusion at 1550–1600 °C of high purity oxide powders doped with analyte elements. The concentrations of the elements were all very similar and were nominally 500, 50 and 5 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The element that differed markedly to these concentrations was As, which had been added to the fusions in the form of arsenic III oxide to help complete de-gassing of the melts. This was therefore present at a concentration of 3500 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in all of the samples. The materials were analysed using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), XRF, ICP-OES, ICP-MS, LA-ICP-MS and LA-SF-ICP-MS; with data being contributed by 10 different laboratories. Method validation was achieved through successful analysis of the US Geological Survey (USGS) reference materials USGS NKT 1G and USGS TB-1G. Preliminary reference and information values for 56 elements were obtained along with uncertainties which were typically in the range 1–20%. It was noted that some elements, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Cr, Ni, Tl and V led to problems during the analysis and this was attributed to analytical limitations.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Four papers <span class="italic">reported forensic applications of the analysis of glass</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162–165</span></sup></a> In the first of these examples, by Sharma <span class="italic">et al.</span>, particle induced gamma ray emission (PIGE) and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) were used for the determination of 18 major, minor and trace elements in soda-lime glass samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> For the PIGE determination of the major elements (Al, Mg, Na and Si), 200 mg of powdered glass sample was mixed with 450 mg of cellulose containing lithium carbonate and then pelletised using a two ton hydraulic press. The reference materials USGS STM-1 and USGS G2 were prepared in the same way. The INAA determinations of the trace analytes required only 50–100 mg of sample. The four elements determined using PIGE were sufficient to determine whether or not a glass was of the soda-lime type whereas the other 14 analytes could be used to identify differences between glasses of the same type. Strangely, the authors did not explore this in greater depth by using any chemometric techniques. The paper by Park and Carriquiry gave an overview of the learning algorithms available that can evaluate forensic glass evidence.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit163"><sup><span class="sup_ref">163</span></sup></a> The overview contained 46 references and gave a very lengthy description of the history of statistical analysis of glass, methods to compare the elemental composition of glasses, datasets used for training, testing and analysis, comparisons between different algorithms and a general discussion. It was good to note that this group are constructing a large glass database with enough information from both within and between glass samples to enable the computation of well-conditioned estimates of high dimensional covariance matrices. The research group is to make this database available to anyone working in the area. The concept was then expanded upon in a paper by Park and Tyner.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit164"><sup><span class="sup_ref">164</span></sup></a> Here, they used their database to simulate different forensic scenarios. Two different classifiers (the standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method and Random Forest) were compared in an attempt to elucidate why the learning algorithms out-perform traditional methods for classifying float glass. By analysing every step of the ASTM method, it was concluded that it was not optimal. The fourth paper was by Teklemariam and Gotera who used LIBS to analyse food glass containers and then cluster analysis to discriminate between them.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> Eight NIST glass reference materials were used for verification purposes and 18 different types of glass (jars, float glass, bottles, bulbs, a tea cup, a laboratory beaker and an electronic display glass) were the test samples. A library of data comprising 47 wavelengths belonging to 12 different elements was obtained by repeat (<span class="italic">n</span> = 10) analysis of NIST 1411. The same wavelengths were then monitored for the sample glasses with 10 shots at 10 different places on the sample being measured. Both univariate and multivariate calibration strategies were adopted. The univariate calibration utilised a simple ordinary least squares regression method where the LIBS emission intensity at each wavelength and its corresponding oxide concentration given for the NIST glass standards were examined. A simple correlation between intensity and the oxide concentration was assumed. However, the correlation coefficients were extremely poor. The multivariate calibration strategy using partial least squares regression with data obtained from five of the NIST glass standards provided significantly better calibration data. Once confidence in the data had been obtained they were treated using hierarchical cluster analysis using Ward’s method. This was employed to discriminate between the different types of glass. Clear discrimination between the different glass samples was obtained and this was further emphasised when the technique of “bootstrap” re-sampling of the data was employed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several other applications have been reported. A particularly interesting one was published by Momcilovic <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used <span class="italic">LIBS as a tool for the determination of surface hardness of glass samples</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a> These authors used a transversely excited atmospheric pressure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser (TEA CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>), which previous studies had shown offers some advantages over the Nd:YAG laser. The ratio of the signal of the Zr ion line at 355.66 nm to the Zr atom line at 360.12 nm was used to determine the hardness of the sample. This was because these lines were narrow, sharp and well resolved compared with some of the other signals and also provided good sensitivity. A Vickers Hardness test was run as a complementary technique. A plot of the Zr ionic/Zr atomic intensity ratio against the Vickers hardness gave a correlation of 0.998. An additional advantage of the technique was that it could be used for curved glass surfaces or surfaces of irregular shape, whereas the Vickers hardness test cannot.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another paper that used a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser for LIBS analysis was presented by Lehmann <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used it for <span class="italic">the rapid determination of Pb in glass cullet</span> as a means of classifying the glass prior to re-cycling.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">167</span></sup></a> Five glass samples were first analysed using XRF which identified that the Pb contents ranged between 1 and 25%. The authors then used two different LIBS setups. One was a standard setup using the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser with an echelle spectrometer. A modification was made where the echelle spectrometer was replaced by a series of filters, a fast photodiode and an oscilloscope. A schematic diagram of both setups was provided. The first setup was used to identify the spectral regions required so that the correct filters could be used in setup 2. Two potential ranges were identified: between 360 and 370 nm and between 400 and 410 nm. Two strong K atom lines were observed in the second range and these were thought likely to cause interference. A mathematical correction factor was therefore devised. Once the system was optimised, the LOD for the first region was approximately 6 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> whereas the second region produced LOD that were approximately an order of magnitude lower. The system was compared with a commercial XRF sorting instrument capable of analysing glass fragments of between 3 and 60 mm with an accuracy of 98% for fragments over 16 mm and with a sample throughput of 28 tons per hour. The LIBS setup with the filters was capable of making an identification in 5 ms, had a LOD of 6% in the 360–370 nm region and 0.6% in the 400–410 nm region. Although these LOD are huge, it should be noted that a lead crystal glass may contain up to 30% Pb and hence the methodology is fit for purpose. Although these LOD are comparable with the XRF-based sorter, it was hoped that the LOD could be improved further by utilisation of a higher efficiency photodiode.</p>

        <span>The properties of materials used in plasma facing materials for nuclear fusion remains a popular topic, with LIBS being the dominant measurement technique in this field. The properties of materials used in nuclear fission reactors is also a key area, including fuel composition and impurities, and resistance of materials to corrosion. Accurate and precise measurement of isotopic ratios of radionuclides using various mass spectrometric techniques has been applied to source attribution, with important implications for nuclear safeguards and contamination monitoring.

The purity, durability, integrity and structural changes of tungsten and tungsten-alloys in plasma-facing components was the focus of a number of studies in relation to safe and efficient operation. The interaction of deuterium and tritium with materials was also studied extensively.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Given its ability to <span class="italic">undertake real-time, in situ, remote measurements in extreme environments, LIBS remains a popular technique</span> when investigating materials used fusion.

          <span>Some of the most popular techniques used for the analysis of thin films is SIMS or TOF-SIMS. Numerous papers have been published in this research area. Three papers by the same research group reported the use of <span class="italic">massive cluster SIMS</span> for the analysis of the homogeneity of photoacid generator<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit235"><sup><span class="sup_ref">235</span></sup></a> and photoresist films.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit236"><sup><span class="sup_ref">236,237</span></sup></a> All thee papers used Au<small><sub>400</sub></small><small><sup>4+</sup></small> clusters for the analysis. The methodology was capable of determining the components of the materials with 10–20 nm lateral resolution and approximately 10 nm depth resolution. The samples were bombarded with a stream of particles, each of which is separated in time and space, and then the emitted ions were collected and analysed using TOF-SIMS. In the paper by Hou <span class="italic">et al.</span> 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 individual particles were used, creating 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 mass spectra. This enabled identification of co-localised molecules at the nanoscale range. Approximately 85–95% of secondary ions indicated an origin of photoacid generator – photoacid generator co-emissions and 90% showed polymer – photoacid generator co-emission. This indicated that the photoacid generator molecules exist as small aggregates that are &lt; 10 nm in size and that these aggregates are highly homogeneously distributed within the polymer matrix. A fourth paper used a dual beam system in which a primary beam of argon gas clusters (Ar<small><sub>2300</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>) at an energy of 5 keV with secondary ion intensities measured using Bi<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> at 25 keV to analyse organic layers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit238"><sup><span class="sup_ref">238</span></sup></a> Both beams were at 45° to the sample, but the bismuth beam was at a 90° azimuth to the argon gas cluster ion beam. The bismuth beam ion intensity was less than 0.2% of that of the gas cluster beam. Five methods of measuring the interface position were compared, with the theory behind each of them being discussed. Briefly, method one used the median interface position in the intensity profiles for the five lightest ions for 15 ≤ <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> ≤ 150. Method two used extrapolation of the position for each ion to <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> = 0 for ions with <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> ≤ 150. Method three was the same as for method two but for <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> ≤ 300. Method four used the extreme positions for all <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> ≤ 100. A fifth method used pseudo-molecular ions to calculate the position. Comparison with the location identified using the matrix terms identified that the errors associated were: method four 10%, method three 12%, method one 14%, method two 17% and method five being by far the worst at 50%.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Michalowski has produced a series of papers that have <span class="italic">utilised SIMS for the depth-profiling analysis of thin films</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239–241</span></sup></a> In one, ultra-low impact energy (90–150 eV) SIMS was used to elucidate chemical states in annealed thin films of titanium and indium that had been deposited on silica.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239</span></sup></a> The use of ultra-low energy primary ions ensure that the sputtering process is significantly different to that observed at normal energy (&gt;1 keV). This is because they do not have sufficient energy to break strong covalent bonds. This means that it is possible to use it to obtain qualitative information about the types of bonds present in a sample. The procedure identified the formation of titanium and indium oxides, but in the case of the Ti, the silicide was also identified. The second paper used SIMS for investigating carbon grain formation in boron nitride epitaxial layers with atomic depth resolution.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240</span></sup></a> When grown under a flow of argon, the films become contaminated with carbon in the form of clusters. Two types of growth of the boron nitride films were identified: 3D growth and self-terminated growth. The growth mode that occurs depended largely on the pressure within the reactor; with low pressure favouring 3D growth. In this mode, the carbon clusters appear in an organised way with the cluster in one boron nitride layer nucleating another in the successive layer. Eventually, a 3D carbon grain is formed. At high pressure, the self-terminated growth occurs and the carbon clusters are more chaotically arranged.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A gas co-injection system used in conjunction with a focussed ion beam TOF-SIMS analysis and with standard TOF-SIMS was reported in two papers by Priebe <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit242"><sup><span class="sup_ref">242,243</span></sup></a> Although having some advantages, focussed ion beams can also produce disadvantageous analytical artefacts. When used in conjunction with the gas co-injection system, these artefacts were minimised. In addition, the addition of certain gases can enhance the ionisation probability (and hence sensitivity) of analyses. In the study by Priebe <span class="italic">et al.</span>, the influence of water vapour and fluorine on the secondary ion signals and sputtering rates was studied.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit242"><sup><span class="sup_ref">242</span></sup></a> The system was used for the depth-profile analysis of thin films (100 nm) of silver, copper, tungsten and zirconium. Samples were analysed using an ambient vacuum as well as in the presence of water vapour and fluorine. The highest increase in ionization probability was achieved for the copper thin film, which was increased by a factor of 10 by water vapour, whereas the fluorine increased it by a factor of 510. When sputtering rate was studied, it was the zirconium film that was most affected. The second paper discussed how the addition of fluorine enhanced spatial resolution of TOF-SIMS and had the added bonus of separating mass interference.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit243"><sup><span class="sup_ref">243</span></sup></a> A compact high vacuum-compatible version of a TOF-SIMS instrument was integrated with a focussed ion beam system and this was used to analyse a multi-layered sample comprising 100 nm thick thin films of Cu, Zr and zirconium copper silver alloy. The signals arising from the secondary ions were enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude, which led to much higher spatial resolution. The quality of the images and the depth profiles were improved during a single measurement. This is not possible under standard vacuum conditions. Another advantage was that the addition of the fluorine enabled the interference from <small><sup>107</sup></small>Ag<small><sup>+</sup></small> on <small><sup>91</sup></small>Zr<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> to be overcome. This was considered to be an important advance because the polyatomic interferences such as this are still a significant problem during SIMS or TOF-SIMS analyses.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The TOF-SIMS <span class="italic">three dimensional analysis of thin films deposited on high aspect ratio structures via</span> atomic layer deposition and chemical vapour deposition was discussed by Kia <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit244"><sup><span class="sup_ref">244</span></sup></a> Two different kinds of high aspect ratio structures were used during the study. One studied the cobalt seed layer corrosion by copper electrolyte before and after copper electroplating. However, samples such as this where the copper may enter through the silica can cause severe problems with the analysis because of geometrical shadowing. This arises because of the 45° angle of the primary beam. The problem is discussed at length with the aid of diagrams in the paper. The second study introduced a new testing platform designed to eliminate these problems. Lateral high aspect ratio test chips were used to study the uniformity of silicon dopant concentration in atomic layer deposited hafnium oxide films. In contrast to the conventional vertical high aspect ratio structures, the lateral ones when used with three-dimensional TOF-SIMs analysis are unaffected by the sputter yield and topography.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Hofmann <span class="italic">et al.</span> also discussed <span class="italic">the problems associated with depth-profiling of multi-layers</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> Preferential sputtering effects are common among some techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> SIMS and GD-OES. However, preferential sputtering can also affect other techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> XPS and Auger electron spectroscopy that measure the residual surface. The depth resolution function can be affected by surface or interface roughness as well as atomic mixing. The surface roughness has an effect of preferential sputtering which has an effect on XPS and Auger electron spectroscopy but no effect on SIMS profiling. Conversely, where there is atomic mixing, there is a strong effect on the depth resolution function which, in turn, affects the SIMS depth-profiling significantly whilst having only a moderate effect on the XPS or Auger results. The interface width, location and the layer thickness calculations are affected by preferential sputtering when depth-profiling is undertaken using XPS or Auger. However, the SIMS data are affected only if there is significant atomic mixing.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">X-ray-based techniques have also been used for depth-profiling or surface analysis. <span class="italic">Reference-free grazing incidence XRF and X-ray reflectometry (XRR)</span> was used by Honicke <span class="italic">et al.</span> for the analysis and depth-dependent characterisation of ultra-thin layer stacks of alumina, hafnia and alumina that had been atomic layer deposited on silicon wafers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit246"><sup><span class="sup_ref">246</span></sup></a> The XRR characterisation was undertaken using a copper K<small><sub>α</sub></small> X-ray source. Since multiple layers, low density contrast materials or very thin layers that do not have pronounced angular minima, the data obtained require a full modelling. This was achieved using commercial software. However, the modelling uses the thickness, roughness and the density of each layer as parameters. This means that the number of parameters increases rapidly and the inter-parameter dependencies can confuse or falsify the modelling results. The authors therefore used a reference free method to help validate the XRR data. A modelling approach to the reference free GIXRF-XRR data was presented, with the overall result being a reduction in the number of free model parameters. Karki <span class="italic">et al.</span> prepared thin films of nickel–titanium using magnetron sputtering from separate titanium and nickel targets and then characterised them in terms of their composition, the depth distribution, stoichiometry and the molecular species present.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit247"><sup><span class="sup_ref">247</span></sup></a> The thickness and density of the films were determined using XRR, the elemental depth profiles of Ni, O and Ti were determined using SIMS and Rutherford back-scattering spectrometry (RBS), the percentage atomic composition was determined using XRR and EDS, and XPS was used to determine which molecular species were present. There was good agreement between XPS and EDS results. The XPS also identified the presence of Ni–O bonds at the surface, which was in agreement with the SIMS results that found surface contamination by O was present in all samples. The thinner films (21.5–22.7 nm) also had O present throughout the body. However, thicker films (51.3–52.3 nm), although having the O contamination at the surface, did not have any in the bulk of the sample. Nolot <span class="italic">et al.</span> prepared some ultra-thin films of molybdenum sulfide on a silica film of 270 nm thickness on a silicon wafer and then characterised them using in-line WDXRF, GIXRF and in-line XPS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit248"><sup><span class="sup_ref">248</span></sup></a> The in-line WDXRF analysis utilised the fundamental parameter approach to elucidate the Mo and S stoichiometry because there were no readily available S standards. Results were within the uncertainty of that obtained using the reference-free GIXRF method. The WDXRF also provided the mass deposited per cycle. Szwedowski-Rammert <span class="italic">et al.</span> used laboratory-based GIXRF and grazing emission XRF (GEXRF) instruments for the analysis of multi-layer structures.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> A good discussion of the capabilities of the techniques was supplied along with easy to understand diagrams. The non-destructive nature of the techniques was emphasised as being one of their advantages. The differences between the two techniques was also highlighted. The experimental section demonstrated that quantitative, non-destructive depth-profile analysis was possible for a nickel–carbon multi-layer sample. The study also demonstrated the first sub-nanometer thickness characterisation of multi-layered samples.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Azuma and Kurokawa studied the <span class="italic">influence of a contamination layer on thickness evaluation of thin films calculated using XRR</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250</span></sup></a> A custom-made XRR spectrometer comprising a powerful X-ray generator, a rotating copper anode, a germanium (111) monochromator and a silicon avalanche photodiode detector was used to analyse a thermally oxidised silica thin film of 10 nm thickness on a silicon (100) substrate. The thin film was cleaned using UV and ozone before analysis. Data acquired were treated using the Parrat equation and a non-linear least squares curve-fitting technique was adopted to obtain the optimal values of the structural parameters. A structural model was also used to obtain theoretical data. The simulated dataset was run on the calculation model without allowing for contamination. The offset in the silica thickness was greatly affected by the contamination layer if its presence was ignored. It was concluded that the offset was independent of the thickness of the contamination layer, but that the density of it was far more significant. In addition, the contribution of the contamination layer to the thickness determination is dependent on the X-ray energy (the wavelength). This was not directly proportional to the X-ray energy though. Instead, it increased when a high contrast was used to obtain better sensitivity for the light elements.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Lasers have also been used for the analysis of thin films</span>. Techniques such as LA-ICP-MS,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> laser ablation of solids in liquids followed by ICP-OES determination (LASIL-ICP-OES<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252</span></sup></a> and LIBS<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a>) have all been used during this review period. The paper by Weiss <span class="italic">et al.</span> used both LA-ICP-MS and LIBS for the direct analysis of solid transition metal boride-based materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> Usually, certified materials matched as closely as possible to the sample type under investigation are required to obtain accurate results for these techniques. These authors circumvented this requirement by undertaking a dried droplet approach for the LIBS measurements. Here, a wafer was dipped in 2% hydrofluoric acid to remove the oxide layer and then 0.5 μL aliquots of standards were pipetted onto the surface in grids of three samples per wafer and four replicates of each. They were then dried in a vacuum desiccator. For the LA-ICP-MS measurements, the authors adopted the microgroove approach, in which micro-grooves were laser ablated into the surface, filled with standard and then ablated into the ICP-MS instrument. Both of the procedures were described in full with the aid of diagrams. As a reference method, the sample was acid digested and analysed using ICP-OES. Both of the laser-based techniques were regarded as being rapid, but with the LA-ICP-MS generally providing the more accurate results for the evaluation of stoichiometry. Herzig <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the use of LASIL-ICP-OES for the quantitative analysis of gadolinium doped cerium oxide thin films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252</span></sup></a> The LASIL cell was a new design made of polyetherether ketone, a particularly inert polymer. This means that the liquid could be a dilute acid. As well as the material of manufacture, the configuration of the ablation cell was altered from previous ones, leading to a hugely decreased (by a factor of six) wash-out time. This lower time for the analyte to be present in the plasma actually improved the sensitivity because there is an increase of analyte in the plasma per unit of time. The LASIL could therefore be used in conjunction with ICP-OES rather than the usual ICP-MS. The paper described the new design at length. The results obtained using the new cell were compared with those obtained using SEM-EDS and were in good agreement. The film thicknesses analysed ranged between 220 and 14 nm. The SEM-EDS reached its limit at 110 nm, whereas the LASIL-ICP-OES method could analyse all of the films with good accuracy. Rapid micro-analysis of aluminium indium tin oxide thin films using LIBS with Nd:YAG 350 picosecond laser pulses was described by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> The thin films had been deposited by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering. The plasma formed was thoroughly characterised in terms of temperature (5063 ± 150 K) and electron number density (4.6 × 10<small><sup>16</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>). A single laser shot created a crater of diameter 46 ± 1 μm and could therefore be regarded as being only partially non-destructive. An EDS analysis was also undertaken so that a comparison could be made. Results from the LIBS and EDS were in agreement.</p>

The authors provided the mathematics to fulfil this. The accuracy of the quantification method was tested using several samples. The bandgap energy profile of the material with optical measurements and the depth profile of Na was correlated with the measurements from open-circuit voltage of the corresponding devices. The quantification of the sample depth was validated by comparison with profilometry and XRF measurements.</p>

          <span>There has been a significant number of <span class="italic">review or overview articles</span> in this research area published over this review period. An overview by van der Heide <span class="italic">et al.</span> cited only 19 references, but gave a decent overview of surface analysis in the semiconductor industry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> The paper concentrated on three main techniques: SIMS, XPS and AFM. A brief overview of the state of the art for each technique was given in individual sections that also gave relevant examples. The SIMS section discussed the advantages of the use of gas cluster ion beam (GCIB) primary beams. Previously, the primary ion beams tended to damage the surface of the sample, whereas the GCIB do not. This makes them particularly useful during the analysis of organic materials, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> thin films or photoresist materials. The use of Orbitrap instruments also improves resolution of standard TOF-SIMS instruments by a factor of 20. An additional advantage is the ability to perform MS/MS analyses, enabling molecular peak assignment – even for complex organic molecules. The introduction of higher energy monochromated photon sources into stand-alone lab-based XPS instruments was also discussed. Such instrumentation has enabled XPS sub-surface analysis, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> beyond the sputter front during depth-profiling. The latest advances in AFM, namely conductive probe atomic force microscopy was also discussed. A second paper by the same research group discussed achieving “reproducible data” and gave examples from the surface analysis of semiconductor materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit258"><sup><span class="sup_ref">258</span></sup></a> In plants where there is high volume manufacturing, it is necessary to have long-term stability of data.

The problems were illustrated by the results of a round-robin test which varied widely. A third overview was presented by Wu <span class="italic">et al.</span> who discussed the recent progress in advanced characterisation methods for silicon-based lithium ion batteries.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a> The overview contained 114 references and advances in the characterisation techniques were summarized. The techniques discussed were split into two main sections: those capable of characterising chemical composition and those that characterise the morphology and crystal structure. Techniques discussed that fall into the first category were hard XPS (HAXPES), TOF-SIMS, XANES, synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Techniques that fall into the second category were SEM, TEM, scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray tomography, <span class="italic">in situ</span> XRR, neutron radiography, <span class="italic">in situ</span> neutron reflectometry, <span class="italic">in situ</span> AFM, <span class="italic">in situ</span> XRD and <span class="italic">in situ</span> Raman.

Nearly five kg of printed circuit boards were collected, stripped of items such as fans and heat sinks, crushed and passed successively through a hammer mill, a knife mill and a vibrating cup mill. It was then homogenised and the particles of &lt;233 μm collected. After placing the material in 104 polypropylene bottles, residual moisture was determined from the contents of three random bottles. Five different acid dissolution procedures were then tested: aqua regia, inverse aqua regia, aqua regia diluted two-fold, concentrated nitric acid and nitric acid diluted two-fold plus hydrogen peroxide. Variables such as sample mass and reagent volumes were optimised using a full factorial design. All digestions were undertaken using microwave assistance. Analysis was performed using ICP-OES and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The analytical data obtained for 14 analytes were then subjected to PCA which identified the diluted aqua regia as being the best dissolution agent. Optimal conditions were to use 0.1 g of material and 10 mL of acid. A paired <span class="italic">t</span>-test was used to compare data obtained from ICP-OES and from INAA. Of the 14 analytes determined, only seven (Ag, Au, Cr, Fe, Sb, Sn and Zn) had data from the ICP-OES that coincided with the range found using INAA.

The performance of the instrument was improved by changing from the standard rhodium X-ray tube to a tungsten one, which extended the analyte list measurable from Cr, Fe and Mn to Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni. The instrument was compact and had no moving parts in the optical system. It was therefore optimised for precision and signal rather than resolution. Different valence states of the analytes Co, Mn and Ni were determined using intensity ratios of different wavelengths. Analysis of the material NCM523 found that the valence change of the 3d transition elements during charging and discharging were 0.68 (from 2.90 to 3.58) for Ni, 0.19 (from 3.00 to 3.19) for Co and no change for Mn.

The method was validated using different pristine anodes with known Si content. Other silicon/carbon anodes from a commercially available cell were tested before contact with the electrolyte and after long-term cycling. Before contact, the Si content was uniform throughout the anode. However, after the long-term cycling, the concentration of Si peaked towards the surface.

After rinsing with pure water, the vessels were further cleaned with acid vapour. Then, 10 g of sample was placed in a quartz vessel and heated to 250 °C. In a separate vessel, 50 g of manganese dioxide was mixed with 150 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to 70 °C. A stream of argon passed the chlorine gas produced through two vessels of sulfuric acid to dry it and then into the vessel containing the sample. The germanium matrix boils away as the volatile compound germanium tetrachloride, which is trapped in a vessel of 20% sodium hydroxide. Once all of the germanium sample had volatilised, the vessel was cooled and the analytes dissolved in 200 μL of sub-boiled hydrochloric and 200 μL of sub-boiled nitric acids. After dilution to 3 mL, the digests were analysed. Sixty one analytes were recovered quantitatively. The method was therefore an extremely efficient way of matrix removal whilst also enabling a modest analyte preconcentration. Therefore, the LOD obtained were impressive, typically being sub-ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and, in some cases, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Be, REE <span class="italic">etc.</span>, being below 0.01 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

Finally, it was diluted to 10 g using reverse aqua regia. Overall, a dilution factor of 100 was obtained. The mechanism of sample decomposition was investigated using XRD and thermogravimetric analysis which identified that sample was converted to (NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>SiF<small><sub>6</sub></small>NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> which, at 250 °C, decomposed completely, evaporating the silicon away.

The method had several advantages over existing methods, including a smaller dilution factor, a shorter digestion time and the addition of relatively cheap and simple reagents. The overall result was that more analytes could be determined reliably.

The samples were heated in an oven at 500 °C for two hours to remove the magnetic field and then placed in a knife mill until the particle size was &lt;500 μm. The LIBS experimentation was undertaken using a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and equipped with a spectrometer and a charge coupled device (CCD) detector. Two of the calibration strategies were multivariate (partial least squares and multiple linear regression) and the other three were univariate (multi-energy calibration, one point gravimetric standard addition and two-point calibration transfer). The authors explained in reasonable detail what each of these were. As well as the models being compared with each other, the data achieved were compared with those obtained following an acid dissolution and ICP-OES analysis. Both multivariate approaches provided reliable data (in the range 80–120% of expected values) for all analytes except Tb. This was attributed to matrix effects because the multivariate techniques can correct for interferences, but not matrix effects. The univariate approaches permitted corrections for matrix effects but it was emphasised that the appropriate selection of the blank and standard was mandatory. The standard error for the univariate methods ranged from 0.01 to 6%. It was concluded that all of the models could be used but that the standout one was the two-point calibration transfer. The other paper, also by Castro <span class="italic">et al.</span>, discussed the determination of Nd in hard disk drive magnets using wavelength dispersive XRF (WDXRF).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> This was a very similar paper to the previous one, but on this occasion, only the three univariate calibration approaches were compared.

It was noted that none of the models presented a perfect calibration, with some interferences occurring for all. However, given certain situations, each had advantages. These were: the identification of spectral interferences by multi-energy calibration, overcoming severe matrix effects using one point gravimetric standard addition and use of a single point for calibration using two-point calibration transfer.</p>

This gave figures for the “total” concentration of analytes. Other sub-samples underwent the leaching procedure in which 2 g of sample was mixed with a mixture of iron-oxidising and sulfur-oxidising bacteria.

This is considered to be a serious accident. Under normal circumstances, the power must be switched off while sampling and analysis occurs. Standoff analysis using LIBS is therefore hugely advantageous because it is quick and does not require an interruption to service. In the paper by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span>, surface pollution was analysed in such a standoff way.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit274"><sup><span class="sup_ref">274</span></sup></a> The power of the laser was altered and the higher the power, the greater the signal became along with a concomitant improvement in precision for some elements. However, the increased power also caused self-absorption for some elements and severe matrix effects for others. The compromise laser energy of 80 mJ was chosen for further experiments. The effects of delay time and particles size and density were also determined during the optimisation. If the delay time was too long, the amount of Na ionised increased, hence leading to a decrease in signal at the wavelengths of 588.995 and 589.592 nm. A delay of 3 μs was chosen as optimal. Similarly, a decrease in the particle size and an increase in the density of the sample both, improved the relative spectral intensities of the elements tested. The spectral intensities from 25 points on each sample were each divided by the background signal of the substrate, and the results were averaged. Results from the analysis of SEM-EDS were compared with those from LIBS. Several analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Mg and Na could be determined using LIBS, but not SEM-EDS.

Similar experiments were also undertaken in the laboratory. The only difference in experimental setup was the use of a Mechelle spectrometer. The method developed identified some simple spectral indicators that reflect the extent of the chemical modification to the insulator surface. These indicators were the relative signals of C (as the CN molecular wavelength at 388.34 nm) and Si (at 390.58 nm).

        <p class="otherpara">A number of <span class="italic">studies covering investigations of data acquisition by sNP-ICP-MS</span> have been published this year. One of these reports assessed the effect of the cell gas type used in a collision/reaction cell (CRC) on the peak width of the resulting data.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit279"><sup><span class="sup_ref">279</span></sup></a> The influence of various CRC gases, gas flow rates, NP sizes and NP types was evaluated using Ag, Au, Fe and Pt NPs with both single and triple quadrupole ICP-MS instruments. The results showed that using a CRC produced a significant increase in the NP signal peak width (from 0.5 up to 6 ms). The effect was found to be greater as the cell gas relative atomic mass/relative molecular mass (RAM/RMM) increased. At a higher gas flow rate and/or for particles &gt;100 nm <span class="italic">∅</span>, the NP signal duration was also prolonged to a larger extent. For example, the use of NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> for Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> NPs, detected as Fe(NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> = 90 amu, induced a significant peak broadening compared with that observed when using H<small><sub>2</sub></small> (6.10 ± 1.60 <span class="italic">vs.</span> 0.94 ± 0.49 ms). This extension of transit time was attributed to the collisions/interactions of the ion cloud generated by a single NP event and precluded the detection of 50 nm Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> NPs when using the NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> mass-shift approach. The authors concluded that the influence of a longer peak width on the accuracy of sNP-ICP-MS measurement data must be taken into account when using CRC to overcome polyatomic interferences and that to mitigate this potential detrimental effect light CRC gases and low gas flow rates should be used. It is now possible to use dwell times as short as 10 μs in sNP-ICP-MS. The effect of these shorter dwell times on the particle size detection limit (PS LOD) has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit280"><sup><span class="sup_ref">280</span></sup></a> Decreasing dwell times below 100 μs did not lead to a statistically significant decrease in the PS LOD. For Ag NPs PS LOD was estimated to be 10–11 nm. When analysing samples of NPs close to the LOD, a low detection yield was observed. Only 5% of the number of NPs, estimated from the transport efficiency and particle number concentration, were detected whilst 20 nm NPs showed a 44% detection yield. Only for 30 nm NPs did the number of particles detected correspond to the theoretical value. Therefore, estimates of NP concentrations should be made with great caution at sizes approaching the PS LOD. In sNP-ICP-MS the use of a short dwell time to aid the detection of small nanoparticles can cause detector saturation for much larger particles and this has been evaluated this year.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit281"><sup><span class="sup_ref">281</span></sup></a> In this work, the suitability of a traditional dead time correction (DTC) method applied to both ms and μs time-resolved (TR) spICP-MS was assessed. A custom data acquisition system was used to record the pulse counting signal at a sustained rate of 2 × 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> samples per second. Model transients from microdroplets containing different concentrations of a thallium element standard were studied. The data were compared with the analysis of 11 Au NP suspensions covering a size range of 10–100 nm and introduced <span class="italic">via</span> regular solution nebulisation. Applying DTC to μs TR sNP-ICP-MS data allowed the increase of the maximum number of counts tolerated per particle or droplet four-to fifteen-fold, resulting in a linear dynamic range of 10–60 instead of 10–40 nm AuNP. A cross-calibration between standard and attenuated sensitivity mode was established, further extending the linear dynamic range to 10–100 nm for Au NPs. The authors concluded that the findings support the theory of dead time related count losses being the main reason for nonlinear response in pulse counting sNP-ICP-MS but that the results also indicate that DTC can lead to slightly distorted particle size distributions. An alternative approach to extending the linear dynamic range is to monitor different isotopes of the element under study which is not possible with sNP-ICP-MS as data would be lost due to the fast scanning times involved (note that this is not the case for ICP-TOF-MS). However, combining sequential analysis of the same sample could be possible and this has been reported for Ti NPs whereby data for both <small><sup>47</sup></small>Ti and <small><sup>48</sup></small>Ti were acquired.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit282"><sup><span class="sup_ref">282</span></sup></a> The linear range for <small><sup>48</sup></small>Ti was 30–400 nm, although detector saturation often occurred at a particle size of 250 nm or greater, whilst for <small><sup>47</sup></small>Ti it was 40–600 nm. The use of a desolvation device, coupled with SF-ICP-MS to reduce the PS LOD has also been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit283"><sup><span class="sup_ref">283</span></sup></a> For samples injected as a wet aerosol the PS LOD was 5 nm for Ag NPs and 19 nm for TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs.

In sNP-ICP-TOF-MS the steady-state background ion signals follow a compound Poisson distribution that reflects noise contributions from Poisson-distributed arrival of ions and gain statistics of microchannel-plate-based ion detection.

The critical level (false positive probability was set to 5%) and detection limit (false positive and false negative probabilities were set to 5%) based on Poisson distributions, were implemented to determine the thresholds. A range of different sets of NP ion cloud extraction conditions were tested to verify the calculated thresholds and to obtain optimal extraction conditions at different Ag<small><sup>+</sup></small> concentrations. The authors stated that the method can be universally applied for the detection of different elements with sNP-ICP-MS. This approach may prove beneficial for those workers in <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the ecotoxicology field, where samples from exposure studies contain both NPs and dissolved species of the analyte element. An alternative approach to baseline reduction is to separate out the dissolved and NP fractions in a sample which can be achieved using FFF with the dissolved species going to waste. This does of course limit the information available about a sample and precludes the determination of <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the ratio of free and particle bound nutrients or toxicologically relevant elemental species which are required for mass balance purposes. Thus, workers have constructed an interface to convert the discontinuous cross flow in FFF into a continuous flow to the ICP-MS instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit286"><sup><span class="sup_ref">286</span></sup></a> Two frit materials, ceramic and steel, were investigated to overcome the challenges of the interaction of dissolved elemental species with the frit and to improve recovery. The set up allowed a combined method to be developed which monitored both the dissolved fraction in the cross flow and the particulate fractions in the detector flow. Comparison of the dissolved fraction data with those obtained from ultrafiltration of the samples under test, aqueous standards and environmental water samples, gave mean recoveries in the range of 87% to 120% for Ca, Mg and Si. In the case of Al and P the dissolved fraction was in the low μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range which resulted in elevated recoveries although still matching within confidence intervals.

        <p class="otherpara">There are <span class="italic">numerous methods used to determine particle size and particle number concentrations</span> available to the analyst. The results of a European metrology project, InNanoPart, has developed methods for the measurement of particle size, concentration, agglomeration, surface chemistry and shell thickness.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit288"><sup><span class="sup_ref">288</span></sup></a> Advancements made included being able to make SI traceable measurements of nanoparticle number concentration in liquids through small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and sNP-ICP-MS as reference methods with Au NPs of differing sizes, 10, 30 and 100 nm being the model analyte. Particles with a 5 nm diameter could not be detected by the reference methods and those of 250 and 500 nm exhibit a high degree of sedimentation so were not studied further. The paper contains a wealth of detail on the methodologies used and also covers the validation of a range of laboratory methods, including particle tracking analysis (PTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS), ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and electrospray-differential mobility analysis with a condensation particle counter (ES-DMA-CPC). In general, it was shown that reference methods agree on a number concentration values within their uncertainties, which were better than 10%. Additionally, for all measured samples, agreement of the nominal method with the reference methods could be verified. The laboratory methods showed a good degree of agreement with reference methods and nominal values, even though they provided much higher uncertainties. A separate study also compared a number of different methods, SEM, DLS, DMA, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and sNP-ICP-MS, for particle number concentration (PNC) measurements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit289"><sup><span class="sup_ref">289</span></sup></a> The analytes were monodisperse AuNPs of 30 or 60 nm <span class="italic">∅</span> with different surface coatings (citrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone or branched polyethyleneimine). The two techniques that only measured the NP core size (sNP-ICP-MS and SEM), as opposed to the larger hydrodynamic diameter, yielded PNCs with the closest agreement (within 20% of each other), while PNCs among all techniques sometimes varied by a factor of 3. Positively charged AuNPs coated with branched polyethyleneimine yielded the most variable results. Deriving the PNC using the particle size distribution has several advantages over using only the mean size based on these results. The size distributions measured by the different techniques were also used to model the AuNP concentration that would reach the cells in an <span class="italic">in vitro</span> toxicity experiment. A strong impact of the analytical technique on the modelled cellular AuNP concentration for some of the AuNPs was found. A systematic evaluation of flow field flow fractionation (FIFFF)-UV-ICP-MS and sNP-ICP-MS/MS has been undertaken and the results obtained compared with data DLS, NTA, TEM, membrane filtration, centrifugation and dialysis for the detection of iron oxide (FeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>) NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit290"><sup><span class="sup_ref">290</span></sup></a> Seven synthetic nano- and submicron FeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> with different mineralogy and coating were prepared.

The FIFFF system could detect Fe–natural organic matter complexes &lt;5 nm and organo-mineral FeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> particles ranging in size from 5–300 nm. The sNP-ICP-MS method had a size detection limit for FeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> of between 32 and 47 nm. The distribution of hydrodynamic diameters of goethite particles detected with FIFFF, NTA and DLS were similar but the values were twice as large as the Fe cores of particles detected using sNP-ICP-MS and TEM. Conventional fractionation by centrifugation and dialysis generally yielded similar fractions as FIFFF but membrane filtration overestimated the large size fractions. Single particle ICP-MS has also been evaluated and validated as a qualitative method for the assessment of the presence/absence of particles containing specific elements in a sample.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit291"><sup><span class="sup_ref">291</span></sup></a> The binary response obtained allows the use sNP-ICP-MS as a screening tool for rapid classification of samples, which can be analysed further if required. A metrological treatment of sNP-ICP-MS as qualitative method was undertaken, providing solid criteria for identifying particle events and the presence of particle in the samples by using the critical value (or limit of decision) concept. Based on theoretical and experimental evidence, a critical value for identification of particle like events by using a 5 sigma criterion (where sigma is the standard deviation of the baseline) was proposed to eliminate or minimise the occurrence of false positives. A 2.33 sigma criterion, where sigma is the standard deviation of the number of particles counted in blanks was proposed for use to confirm the presence of particles larger than the minimum detectable size in a sample. Size critical values of 25–30 nm were obtained for metallic, spherical and solid particles of gold and silver and 50–80 nm for aluminium, whereas number concentration critical values of around 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> particles per L were achieved. Subsequently, the screening approach was applied to the detection of particles from approved metallic additives in foods which showed that some products labelled as containing NPs did not do so when subjected to the developed method.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A number of studies have used <span class="italic">LA-ICP-MS imaging for the detection of NP exposed tissues</span>. Three papers have been published by the same group of workers on the imaging of Ag NPs in collagen rich microstructures using LA coupled with either ICP-MS or ICP-TOF-MS. In the first paper of this series, high resolution LA-ICP-TOF-MS, with cellular spatial resolution, was used to assess the uptake of Ag NPs by fibroblast multicellular spheroids (MCS) of 20 μm thickness.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit292"><sup><span class="sup_ref">292</span></sup></a> A 193 nm laser was used with a 10 μm spot size and the instrumental acquisition time was 20 ms per replicate. Quantitative data were acquired for the Ag NPs and elemental distributions of Ag, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P and Zn. The LOD values obtained were at the femtogram level. Matrix-matched calibration standards were printed using a non-contact piezo-driven array spotter with an Ag NP suspension and multi-element standards. After incubation of the NPs with the MCS for 48 h the Ag NPs were only detected in the outer rim of the MCS and not in the core. The Ag NPs were inhomogeneously localised in the outer rim and co-localised with single-cell-like structures visualized by the Fe distribution. The quantitative value for the total mass of Ag NPs in a thin section obtained by the method agreed with that obtained using ICP-MS in liquid mode after acid digestion of the MCS sections. In the second paper in the series, MCSs were incubated with Ag NP suspensions, 5 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 24 h and LA-SF-ICP-MS (spot size 8 μm, dwell time 2 ms) was used to quantitatively image the Ag NP and Br, Cu, P, and Zn distributions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit293"><sup><span class="sup_ref">293</span></sup></a> A calibration using a NP suspension was applied to convert the measured Ag intensity into the number of NPs present. The determined numbers of NPs in the MCS thin sections ranged from 30 to 7200 particles in an outer rim. The particle distribution was clearly correlated with the P and Zn present. The third paper reported on the penetration of different size and coated NPs into the MCS, with different incubation times, using LA-ICP-TOF-MS as a means of detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit294"><sup><span class="sup_ref">294</span></sup></a> The MCS sections were exposed for up to 48 h to one of four types of Ag NPs (5, 20 or 50 nm <span class="italic">∅</span> citrate coated, or 20 nm <span class="italic">∅</span> polyvinylpyrrolidone coated). The results showed that the penetration pathway of the NPs was strongly related to steric networks formed by collagen fibrils, and that Ag NPs with a hydrodynamic diameter &gt; 41 nm were completely trapped in an outer rim of the MCSs. The impact of the NPs on essential elements (P, Fe, Cu, and Zn) in areas of Ag NP accumulation was also investigated. A linear increase at the sub-femtogram level in the total concentration of Cu in samples treated with small or large Ag NPs (5 or 50 nm <span class="italic">∅</span>) was observed.

The results obtained showed that between 48 and 92% of the AgNPs dissolved during the digestion, with those with a citrate modified surface being more stable than those modified with lipoic acid. Cellular exposure to increasing concentrations of pristine or <span class="italic">in vitro</span> digested AgNPs resulted in a concentration dependent increase of total Ag and AgNPs content in the cellular fractions. The cellular concentrations were significantly lower following exposure to <span class="italic">in vitro</span> digestion AgNPs compared with the pristine AgNPs. Transport of silver as either total Ag or AgNPs was limited (&lt;0.1%) following exposure to pristine and <span class="italic">in vitro</span> digestion AgNPs.

Spike recovery tests in the proposed extractant solutions, using Ag NPs or AgNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> were conducted and recoveries for the former were 95–105%. However, the TMAH alone caused AgNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> to precipitate and was therefore not a suitable extractant. However, this effect was not observed when CaCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> was added to the TMAH before use. The authors postulated that the cause of this apparent particulate signal with TMAH is likely to be precipitation as Ag<small><sub>2</sub></small>O under the high pH conditions and that the addition of CaCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> might drive dissolved Ag<small><sup>+</sup></small> to form complexes with the Cl<small><sup>−</sup></small> anion or perhaps with the TMAH, such as [AgN(CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>4</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small>. Proteinase K, with or without CaCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>, failed to completely digest the tissues. Silver NPs spiked onto liver tissues and analysed 24 h later, also showed no significant change in particle size distribution or particle mass concentration compared with those freshly spiked into solution without liver present. The particle number concentration fell significantly to around 80% of the freshly spiked Ag NP. Samples from an <span class="italic">in vivo</span> dietary study where fish were fed nominally 100 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Ag, as either AgNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> or Ag NPs, were analysed to demonstrate the utility of the method.

The effect of organic C was also investigated by preparing samples in 1, 2 and 5% v/v MeOH which gave signal enhancements of 8, 22 and 22%, respectively, again when compared to standards prepared in water, leading to an over estimation of the particle size. Whether this effect is due to improved sample transport or ionisation efficiency is not known but the latter has not been reported for Ag although it is a known effect for elements with a high first ionisation potential.

Metal NP size and particle number concentration was obtained using sNP-ICP-MS. Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and centrifugal field-flow fractionation (CFFF) separated and sized the CPs based on their hydrodynamic diameter and buoyant mass, respectively. Off-line sNP-ICP-MS analysis of fractions obtained by the FFF separations facilitated measurement of the mass and number of Au–PS (goldpolystyrene) engineered NPs (from 1 to &gt;8) contained in the CPs.

The authors concluded that the developed methodology could be applied to investigate NP properties in environmental systems. Wetlands and river floodplains are often very rich in natural organic matter (NOM). Strong binding of chalcophile metals like copper by NOM is expected to interfere with sulfide precipitation and is likely to affect the growth of these nanoparticles.

      <h2 id="sect2327"><span class="a_heading">4 Cultural heritage</span></h2>
      <span>Samples of cultural heritage/archaeological samples have been collected into their own section in this year’s review rather than being spread amongst other sections. The analysis of such materials can achieve many things including elucidating provenance and trade routes, obtaining information on preparation techniques and detecting forgeries. Since all such samples are precious (not just in monetary terms), there has been a push over many years to use analysis techniques that cause no or, at worst, minimal damage. As such, X-ray-based techniques and laser-based techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LIBS or LA followed by atomic spectrometric detection, have proven very popular. Often, the data have been obtained by analytical scientists, but the paper is then written by an archaeologist or a historian. Therefore, there is often a paucity of scientific detail in many of the papers. Therefore, most of the papers discussed in this section will appear in tabular form.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Several <span class="italic">review or overview articles</span> have appeared during this review period. A general review of instrumental techniques for architectural heritage materials was prepared by Zhao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit328"><sup><span class="sup_ref">328</span></sup></a> The review (with 325 references) covered numerous analytical techniques. These were split into six main sections, which were: imaging techniques (optical microscopy, AFM, SEM), traditional spectroscopic techniques (UV-Vis, FTIR, Raman, LIBS), thermal gravimetric analysis (thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry), X-ray-based techniques (XRD, XRF, XPS, XANES, EXAFS, <span class="italic">etc.</span>), ion beam techniques (PIGE and PIXE) and MS-based techniques (GC-MS, pyrolysis-GC-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, TOF-SIMS and ICP-MS). A discussion of the relative merits of each was given in their own sub-sections. The one section that was lacking detail was that about ICP-MS. The assorted papers that used LA-ICP-MS or other related techniques was not really discussed. Nevertheless, it is still a good starting point for people interested in the analysis of cultural heritage materials. Many of the reviews concentrate on a particular technique rather than a specific sample type. An example was produced by Save <span class="italic">et al.</span> who reviewed (with 53 references) the use of portable XRF for large scale geochemical surveys of archaeological settlements and features.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit329"><sup><span class="sup_ref">329</span></sup></a> The analysis of archaeological sites can give an indication of where exactly passed cultures were performing tasks, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> smelting <span class="italic">etc.</span> and so this paper is welcome. Other examples include papers by Zucchiatti<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit330"><sup><span class="sup_ref">330</span></sup></a> who reviewed (with 81 references) ion beam analysis for the study of cultural heritage materials and another by the Analytical Methods Committee who gave a brief overview of LIBS for the analysis of these materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit331"><sup><span class="sup_ref">331</span></sup></a> This latter paper had only five references, but gives an overview of the concepts of LIBS and how it may be used for the analysis of assorted smaller objects as well as larger ones, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> monuments. A fuller review of the use of LIBS in archaeological science was presented by Ruan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit332"><sup><span class="sup_ref">332</span></sup></a> The review (with 163 references) gave examples published between 2011 and 2017 that had used LIBS to analyse metallic alloys, ceramics, glasses, painted artworks, historical buildings and biomaterials. There were also brief sections describing where LIBS was combined with other techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Raman and ICP-MS. A review paper by Ager <span class="italic">et al.</span> gave an overview of the work undertaken at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores, Seville, Spain, that has focussed on the analysis of cultural heritage samples for several years.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit333"><sup><span class="sup_ref">333</span></sup></a> The institute used to focus on ion beam analysis technologies, but more recently has concentrated on the use of portable XRF instrumentation. Numerous examples are given that demonstrate the applicability of the technique to jewellery, coins, paintings and ceramics. The advantages and disadvantages of the techniques are discussed along with methodologies, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> combining the techniques, of overcoming them. The review contained only 29 references, but is an interesting read. Tonazzini <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed (with 118 references) the analytical and mathematical methods used for revealing hidden details in ancient manuscripts and paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit334"><sup><span class="sup_ref">334</span></sup></a> Analytical techniques discussed included multi-spectral imaging, XRF, thermography, Raman and LIBS. The mathematical approaches included chemometric methods, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> PCA and its modifications (independent component analysis (ICA) and dependent component analysis (DCA)), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), self-organising maps and blind source separation techniques. Other approaches discussed included pseudo-colour imaging and RGB imaging (where red, green and blue light is used in different proportions to produce a large number of colours). A section on future perspectives was also presented which discussed the potential of digital photography for this type of task. One last review of note was presented by Katsifas and Zachariadis who gave an overview (with over 80 references) of EDXRF spectrometry and complementary non-destructive analytical techniques in the archaeometric study of copper artefacts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit335"><sup><span class="sup_ref">335</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Heginbotham <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the results of an <span class="italic">inter-laboratory comparison using EDXRF</span> of copper alloys found in heritage materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit336"><sup><span class="sup_ref">336</span></sup></a> A protocol was devised and five institutions participated using nine tube-based instruments of seven different types. When all participants used the same protocol, reproducibility improved by between 65 and 83%. This enabled 15 analytes to be reported consistently compared with only eight from a 2010 study. It was hoped that researchers in the area would use the protocol to collaborate more effectively and with greater confidence in their data.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Two papers have been published that reported the <span class="italic">development of new instrumentation designed specifically for the analysis of cultural heritage materials</span>. Shameem <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the development of an echelle LIBS – Raman instrument that used a single nano-second, pulsed Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm and an intensified CCD as detector for both measurements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit337"><sup><span class="sup_ref">337</span></sup></a> The elimination of background and long-lived fluorescence signals which could mask the weak Raman signal were achieved by gating the CCD detector to extremely low time scales (ns). The different power densities for LIBS and Raman were achieved by changing the focal spot dimensions on the sample surface. The instrument was applied to the analysis of natural and artificial pigments in artworks and enabled the identification of the materials, provenance, state of conservation and helped elucidate degradation mechanisms. The authors concluded that their hybrid instrument was more compact, had greater stability and was more cost effective and technically more advanced than other, similar instruments. Another paper, by Santos <span class="italic">et al.</span>, characterised an instrument that was capable of undertaking energy dispersive XRD and XRF measurements simultaneously on the same spot on the sample surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit338"><sup><span class="sup_ref">338</span></sup></a> The instrument was described in detail, in the paper. However, it had a conventional copper X-ray source and a single X-ray detector on a computer-controlled XY stage. There was a necessity to obtain several hundred spectra which lengthened the time required for analysis. However, this could be somewhat compensated for by using variable acquisition times, depending on the count rate obtained from individual samples. Data filtering and analysis was undertaken offline by using an algorithm written in the programming language Python. The results obtained from the instrument were sufficiently encouraging to spur the authors into starting the development of a more compact and portable instrument.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A paper by Pospisilova <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the <span class="italic">use of LA-ICP-MS to elucidate provenance of natural clay-based pigments in paintings</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit339"><sup><span class="sup_ref">339</span></sup></a> An ArF laser operating at 193 nm and at 3.7 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> with a repetition rate of 10 Hz was used with a scan rate of 20 μm s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The laser spot size was a critical parameter. If it was less than 65 μm, results were very poor. There was no marked improvement if the laser spot was increased from 65 μm to 110 μm and therefore a spot size of 65 μm was used throughout. Four CRMs were used: a silicate-based one (NIST 612 glass), a carbonate-based one (SARM 40) and two clay-based ones (GW 03101a and GBW 0303). These were pressed into pellets before LA-ICP-MS analysis. In addition to the use of CRMs, further method validation was undertaken by acid decomposition of some of the certified materials followed by ICP-OES determination, analysis by a second laboratory for the silicate content and by SEM-EDS. Having identified that same results were being obtained by all the techniques, the authors used the LA-ICP-MS system and SEM-EDS to analyse a painting entitled “portrait of a horse”. Although complications could arise through the artist’s use of dirty brushes, it was possible to differentiate between different ground preparatory layers. Historically, these layers were made of red clays from three different locations in Europe (Czech, Italian and German boles). This work proved that the clay used in the preparatory layer on this painting originated from Bavaria in Germany.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A paper by the same research group determined the <span class="italic">influence of laser wavelength and laser energy on the depth-profiling of easel painting samples</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit340"><sup><span class="sup_ref">340</span></sup></a> When undertaking such analyses, it is necessary to minimise the damage caused, hence the paper optimised the laser pulse parameters to obtain sufficient resolution whilst ensuring that crater size is minimised, there is no peripheral heat-induced damage to pigments, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Two different wavelengths were used. A Nd:YAG operating at 532 nm and 10 ns pulse duration and a Nd:YAG operating at 266 nm with a pulse duration of 5 ns. The effects of altering the laser power at each wavelength was also tested. In general, the lower wavelength provided better data. The laser power also had an effect, with the higher energy ones giving larger craters. An unsurprising finding was that the number of laser firings at a single spot should be optimised so as to cause least damage. One interesting finding was that F could be determined as CaF during depth-profile studies.</p>

        <span>The analysis of cultural heritage materials in the field of non-ferrous metals has received a significant amount of work during this review period. However, the papers that give very little scientific detail will not be covered in this review. Those papers that give a good description of the science or on how the analytical data are treated are summarised in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>. The same rationale has been applied to samples that are organic in nature, ceramics and glasses.

        <h3 id="sect2601"><span class="b_heading">4.2 Cultural heritage samples of organic origin</span></h3>
        <span>For the cultural heritage field, the need for analytical techniques that can handle minute sample amounts and that <span class="italic">are minimally destructive are still the main focus of developments</span>. A micro-scalpel sampling method has been developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit355"><sup><span class="sup_ref">355</span></sup></a> High precision controllers are utilised to maneuverer the scalpel in all three dimensions at micrometre precision. In addition, the angles at which the scalpel meets the sample surface can be adjusted. This portable device allows the sampling of a minimal amount of material directly from a sample cross-section (width 10–50 μm) and the overall sampling procedure takes approximately 10 min. This results in a very operator friendly device that minimises the destructive nature of this sampling technique. The developed device was utilised to analyse the paint layers (100–200 μm) of a mock sample containing of individual layers of lead white, titanium white, lead white, and lead-tin-yellow. The lead containing layers of this mock sample, as well as the paints used to create this, were analysed using multi-collector ICP-MS to determine the Pb isotope composition. The ratios obtained for the respective layers were indistinguishable from the pigments used to create them illustrating that no contamination between the layers was present.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A very common issue encountered when analysing paintings is that <span class="italic">varnishes and binders can cover up emission from underlying paint layers</span>. This is because signals measured in the nanosecond time scale often only reveal emission from the most fluorescent materials, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> binders and varnish. A multi-spectral time-gated photoluminescence imaging approach was utilised to overcome this.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit356"><sup><span class="sup_ref">356</span></sup></a> It enabled the differentiation of luminescent pigments, based on their different emission spectra but also the lifetimes of these. Owing to the time gated detection it was possible to distinguish the fast-living (lifetime of nano- or picoseconds) from long-living emitters (lifetime of microseconds or milliseconds). Hence, trap state emission of semiconductor pigments could be recorded, which otherwise would have been covered by the intense fluorescence of the organic compounds. For this purpose, a Q-switched laser source (<span class="italic">λ</span> = 355 nm, pulse energy 700 μJ, pulse duration 1.0 ns, repetition rate 100 Hz) was spectrally filtered by an excitation filter and coupled to a silica optical fibre (diameter 600 μm). A uniform excitation over the field of view (10 cm) was achieved by projecting and magnifying the optical fibre head through a magnifying optical telescope. A time-gated intensified camera was utilised for detection, which was created by optically combining an image intensifier (temporal width adjustment from 5 ns to continuous mode) with a cooled monochrome digital camera and a 50 mm objective. Spectral resolution was achieved by using a filter wheel equipped with 10 band pass transmission filters (400–850 nm spaced by 50 nm). The developed set up could then be utilised to record nanosecond and microsecond emissions and was applied to the analysis of two Maimeri paintings (<span class="italic">Ana a tavola</span> and <span class="italic">Vista del Colosseo dai Giardini</span>). Emissions induced by the crystal defects in semiconductor pigments (microsecond timescale) were captured in addition to those at the nanosecond timescale.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The analysis of <span class="italic">painting under-layers can help shed light on the processes involved in creating canvases</span> and generally gain a greater understanding of these under-layers and the preparatory process. For this purpose, a computer-assisted thread-level canvas analysis algorithm was optimised to measure the spacing and angles of canvas threads.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit357"><sup><span class="sup_ref">357</span></sup></a> The algorithm identifies the individual thread trajectories based on X-radiographs that had previously been digitalised at a spatial resolution of 42.3 μm per pixel. The centre-to-centre distances between threads and the thread angle relative to the <span class="italic">X</span>-axis at each point along its length can then be extracted. This was achieved by extracting the canvas features from the digital X-radiograph image based on the difference in optical thickness of the radiopaque ground layer (difference of thickness of threads and the space in between them). Following that, a Bayesian machine-learning model was trained and deployed to automatically detect thread centres based on the thickness differences. Finally, the response was used to trace each thread in the canvas which can be visualised in thread spacing and thread angle maps. This approach was applied to <span class="italic">Girl with a Pearl Earring</span> (Vermeer). The thread count of 14.8 ± 2.7 threads per cm horizontally and 14.6 ± 3.6 threads per cm vertically was comparable to previous Vermeer works and could indicate that this was a preferred choice of canvas. In addition, the results compared well with those obtained in a previous study within the stated uncertainty of the counting method. Thread angle maps highlighted deviations in thread angles, which showed wave-shaped distortions extending more than 5 cm into the picture plane. These are indicative of the points where the edges of the painting were laced onto a larger frame before applying the ground layer, so called primary cusping.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">As was seen in last year’s review, the challenge of handling large amounts of data produced by various spectroscopy techniques remains a focus of the scientific community. To aid classification of Chinese red seal inks an orthogonal partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLSDA) methodology was developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit358"><sup><span class="sup_ref">358</span></sup></a> The aim was to sort ink samples based on their plume fluorescence spectra (250–750 nm). The developed approach maps training observations from wavelength, latent variable and class spaces. It illustrates the similarity of an unknown samples compared with results obtained for training samples and can calculate the class membership probability. It was shown that samples assigned a class membership probability of &gt;80% were correctly sorted 99.5% of the time. The developed method was superior compared with an alternative classification approach in terms of sensitivity (98.9%), specificity (99.8) and false in-class rate. This is a very useful data processing approach for single Japanese ink samples and therefore mainly applicable to the analysis of documents or scriptures. It would be interesting to see if it would be possible to apply this approach to more complex samples, such as ink mixtures or inks from different geographical locations. Other examples of the application of atomic spectrometry to the analysis of organic materials are shown in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab6">Table 6</a>.</p>

        <span>As always, there has been interest in the analysis of glasses of cultural heritage. However, this remains a relatively small section compared with the other sample types. Again, most papers concentrate on causing minimal damage during the actual analysis and then use chemometric techniques to try and elucidate provenance or sample preparation methods. It was noted that the majority of the glass applications tended to have greater quality control, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> reference or certified reference materials were usually analysed. This is far less common during the analysis of ceramics, possibly because of the lack of suitable materials.</span>
