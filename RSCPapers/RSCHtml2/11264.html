NDIs are shown to be an increasingly interesting class of molecules due to their electronic properties, large electron deficient aromatic cores and tendency to self-assemble into functional structures. Almost all NDIs possess high electron affinity, good charge carrier mobility, and excellent thermal and oxidative stability, making them promising candidates for applications in organic electronics, photovoltaic devices, and flexible displays. NDIs have also been extensively studied due to their potential real-world uses across a wide variety of applications including supramolecular chemistry, sensing, host–guest complexes for molecular switching devices, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, ion-channels, catalysis, and medicine and as non-fullerene accepters in solar cells. In recent years, NDI research with respect to supramolecular assemblies and mechanoluminescent properties has also gained considerable traction. Thus, this review will assist a wide range of readers and researchers including chemists, physicists, biologists, medicinal chemists and materials scientists in understanding the scope for development and applicability of NDI dyes in their respective fields through a discussion of the main properties of NDI derivatives and of the status of emerging applications.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2021/CS/d0cs00239a/d0cs00239a-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: d0cs00239a-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2021/CS/d0cs00239a/d0cs00239a-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

      <span>Innovation in organic materials science is becoming an increasingly important tool to address important worldwide problems in broad areas such as energy, materials science, the environment, and biomedicine. As such, the synthesis of new organic functional molecules and their adaptation for high performance materials has continued to gain traction in the last few decades. Several key classes of molecules have been synthesised to this end based on the diimide structure, as the nitrogen functionality in conjunction with aromatic linkers and functional groups enables the introduction of functional properties to a vast family of derivatives for applications that span modern materials science and applied chemistry. In the last three decades, rylene diimides (RDIs) (<strong>1</strong>) have become one of the most important classes of compounds for these applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> There are various classes of RDIs, such as pyromellitic diimides (PMIs), 1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimides (NDIs) (also known as naphthalene carbodiimides) (<strong>2</strong>), perylene tetracarboxylic diimides (PDIs) (<strong>3</strong>) and other larger diimides (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a></span>

      <p class="otherpara">NDIs have been shown to be the most interesting class of molecules due in part to the electronic properties of the large electron deficient aromatic core, which is supplemented by an ability to self-assemble into structures through non-covalent interactions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> This has allowed NDI derivatives to be utilised as functional materials, as their electronic and physical properties are more suited to applications than PMIs and PDIs, and multiple properties including solubility and electronic and supramolecular behaviour can be controlled through functionlization.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">NDIs substituted at the diimide nitrogen are often used as electron acceptors and as supramolecular building blocks for molecular assemblies and supramolecular arrays.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> For example, <span class="italic">N</span>-functionalisation at the diimide position with an aromatic group produces a non-emissive dye, whereas alkyl substitution at the diimide produces white-blue emission.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,6</span></sup></a> Manipulation of the core<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> of NDIs can lead to colorful, conducting, functional aromatic molecules with variable photophysical properties, which can be tuned by the incorporation of different functional groups on the core structure.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Since the key report on core substituted NDIs (cNDIs) by Würthner in 2002,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> new classes of NDIs have been created for functional materials with varying photophysical properties to supplement the core unsubstituted NDIs discovered by Vollmann <span class="italic">et al.</span> in the early 1930s.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> Since then, NDIs have found great versatility because of their tendency to form n-type semiconductor materials, which is not possible with other RDIs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> Furthermore, NDI functionalization through the diimide nitrogen or <span class="italic">via</span> core-substitution varies the absorption and emission properties, allowing the derivatives to act as either donors or acceptors in a controlled manner.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The flat, compact aromatic core of NDI dyes enables aggregation into larger structures, which when combined with their electron deficient nature is of both fundamental and applied interest, as the self-organization affects the properties of the NDI in the resulting supramolecular structures and systems. The self-assembly and self-organization occurs through π–π interactions of the aromatic core which affects the electronic and optical properties, and can be used to tune properties that match the application being studied.

Thereafter, fundamental research efforts on NDIs and cNDIs in the field of supramolecular chemistry will be discussed in depth, focussing not only on the self-organization of the structures, but also the roles of stimuli such as organic solvents, pH, and temperature, to name a few. In the following sections, we will describe non-covalent interactions in a variety of mechanically interlocked molecules such as catenanes, rotaxanes, and pseudorotaxanes including recent applications in molecular motors.

      <p class="otherpara">Due to their electron accepting capacity and conducting properties, NDIs have been used in photovoltaic and optical devices. We will discuss how the donor–acceptor nature of NDI derivatives in bulk heterojunctions is crucial in determining the photovoltaic properties and how bilayer heterojunction solar cells consist of p–n active layers of NDIs.

      <span>One reason NDIs have attracted so much attention is their versatile synthesis, leading to a large library of derivatives.

      <p class="otherpara">The development of rigid organic materials having multiple redox states with emission properties is important for applications in organic electronics and photonic materials. PDI fluorophores have attracted attention because of their high fluorescence quantum yield in solution; however, they suffer from drawbacks such as aggregation-caused emission quenching in the assembled or solid state. To overcome this issue, the Wasielewski and Stoddart group synthesised two chiral isosceles triangles, in which they used one PDI fluorophore and two PMI or NDI units in a cyclic triangle (<strong>151</strong>). Interestingly, the triangle bearing two NDIs and one PDI displayed efficient intramolecular energy transfer from NDI to PDI subunits, in contrast to the triangle prepared from PMI and PDI.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> However, both isosceles triangles show excellent fluorescence quantum yields, 10- to 40-fold larger than the triangle prepared from only PDI. Both the triangles showed reversible redox states, which is useful for molecular organic optoelectronics, energy storage, and energy-harvesting devices in the future. In another report, the group has synthesised two rigid chiral triangles having either two non-identical PMIs and one NDI or two NDIs and one PMI as a redox-active unit.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69</span></sup></a> When compared with a triangle containing three identical NDIs or PMIs, the non-identical triangles formed one-dimensional supramolecular nanotubes by interaction-driven columnar stacking in DMF. They also showed that isosceles triangles can reversibly accept up to six electrons by cyclic voltammetry, and when used for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries the triangles with NDI subunits were superior to PMI in terms of the cell performance of the batteries.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Recently, we have shown that the optical properties of NDI acceptors can be tuned <span class="italic">via</span> the addition of the polymer P3HT in solution, both in the pristine state as well as in a blend film, with tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels due to electron transfer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> As such, three NDI functionalities at the central and peripheral positions of a trimer exhibited two absorption peaks (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> 362 nm and 382 nm) at a high energy, together with a strong shoulder peak at 543 nm in solution. However, in a thin film, the absorption peaks were broader and <span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>max</sub></small> was red-shifted by ∼51 nm, which was due to p–p stacking in solid state. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) on pristine films. The estimated HOMO was −5.70 eV, whereas the LUMO level was calculated to be −4.15 eV with a band gap of 1.55 eV. Furthermore, this novel trimeric derivative was shown to be an excellent n-type material, and when blended with the P3HT p-type semiconductor, the resulting bulk heterojunction solar cell device has an excellent power conversion efficiency of 7.65%. In a similar vein, Lee and co-workers synthesised triads using the acceptor–acceptor–acceptor (A–A′–A) molecular platform, with three different types of pendants (A′): benzothiadiazole (BTD-P), naphthalene diimide with octyl (NDI-O-P) or ethylhexyl groups (NDI-EH-P), or perylene diimide with ethylhexyl (PTCDI-EH-P).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit71"><sup><span class="sup_ref">71</span></sup></a> Both NDI-EH-P and NDI-O-P showed absorption bands at 514 nm with identical spectra, which confirms that the alkyl chain does not have any influence on absorption. In comparison, BTDP displayed a UV-vis band at 445 nm and PTCDI-EH-P produced the longest <span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>max</sub></small> of 587 nm, with the shift becoming more pronounced as the electron-deficiency of the pendant increases from BTD to NDI to PTCDI (<strong>152</strong>–<strong>155</strong>) as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22</a>. As expected, the solid state absorption in films showed a significantly red-shifted absorption compared with the solution spectrum, which is attributed to the formation of J-aggregates. This study demonstrated that simple triads can be used as a model system for future development of donor–acceptor systems. A report by Zerson and co-workers demonstrated for the first time that the properties of copolymers of bis-thiophene-NDI structures can be tuned in spin-cast films and annealed films, and this phenomenon was studied using atomic force microscopy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> This study that compares molecular arrangement along with electronic properties of polymers may be useful for applications where n-type mobility in organic field-effect transistors is important.</p>

      <span>Supramolecular chemistry (chemistry beyond the molecule) is a concept derived from nature to construct complex molecular architectures.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77</span></sup></a> One of the finest examples is the photosynthetic reaction center (PRC) of purple bacteria, where various molecules such as bacteriochlorophyll, two bacteriopheophytins, and two quinones are arranged in a non-covalent manner along an axis of several membrane proteins, giving rise to long-lived charge separation. All the supramolecular thermodynamically stable structures at both the cellular and subcellular levels from nano-to-millimeter dimensions use the bottom-up/bioinspired approach. Supramolecular chemistry uses weak interactions such as π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces to produce architectures of various sizes, shapes, and functions, similar to those of the working PRC molecular apparatus.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77,78</span></sup></a> Using this approach, in the early 1960s, Pedersen, Lehn and Cram developed crown ethers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> cryptands<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> and spherands,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> respectively, and were recognised with the Nobel prize in 1987. Supramolecular self-assembly also allows access to various architectures such as nanoballs, nanotubes, flower-like structures, nanoboxes, cavities, vesicles, and many other structures, which provide molecules with novel physical and chemical properties. For this purpose, various small organic molecules have been used such as porphyrins,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a> oligo(<span class="italic">p</span>-phenylenevinylene), and PDI, to name a few, because of their favorable optical and electronic properties. However, some of these materials suffer from the drawbacks of poor solubility, multistep synthesis and high cost.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Researchers are attracted toward the use of NDIs in supramolecular chemistry due to their relatively easy preparation, redox-activity, access to neutral and planar molecules as well as demonstrated n-type properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> Furthermore, through core-substitution of NDIs their optical and electronic properties can be tuned in line with their structural features, which can be similar to naturally occurring acceptors of PRC.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> Recently, NDIs and cNDIs based on various architectures such as worm-like morphologies, cages, catenanes and rotaxanes, nanotubes, nanowires, gels, and vesicles have been produced with applications in sensors, ion channels, organic solar cells, and organic field-effect transistors and medicinal applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit83"><sup><span class="sup_ref">83</span></sup></a> We have reviewed this part in depth in an earlier review, so here we outline further development of novel NDIs and cNDIs and their use in supramolecular chemistry for the construction of new architectures.</p>

The emission spectrum of NDI-NA in chloroform displayed three weak bands at 408 nm, 430 nm, and 462 nm. However, in a mixture of chloroform and MCH (0–95%), an enhancement of fluorescence was observed with a high quantum yield of ∼22.8%, which is indicative of an aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effect. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to visualise the self-assembled structures, showing that NDI-NA formed 10–100 nm thick multilayer sheets up to 20 mm in length from chloroform/MCH (v/v, 5<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>95), which then formed micelles from curved nanosheets, which further collapse to decrease surface energy and form microcups.</p>

      <h2 id="sect1617"><span class="a_heading">5 Host–guest chemistry</span></h2>
      <span>Host–guest chemistry describes supramolecular complexes that are assembled from two or more molecules <span class="italic">via</span> non-covalent bonding such as hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, π–π interactions, and van der Waals forces. One of the best examples is the creation of the 3D structure of proteins in the biological world, where large molecules interact with one another to create globular structures. Synthetic examples include host–guest chemistry, such as the use of dendrimers in drug-delivery systems, where the drug acts as a guest and the dendrimer as a host <span class="italic">via</span> encapsulation, improving the drug delivery by sustained and selective release of the drug. Host–guest chemistry can also be used for chemical sensing applications, where the receptor site is covalently bound to an indicator, and when the analyte (guest) binds, the indicator changes color or undergoes a change in a similar physical property. Host–guest chemistry can be employed for environmental applications, where the host systems can be utilised to remove hazardous components by size selectively, such as calix[4]arene being used to trap a cesium ion. To study host–guest chemistry, various techniques have been used, and one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which identifies the chemical shift of the proton of the host upon binding to the guest. Another two techniques that are also useful to study host–guest interactions are UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. NDI is a planar molecule and has been used as a building block in donor–acceptor charge transfer complexes, which is an important phenomenon in host–guest complexes to organise various structures such as foldamers, ion-channels, catenanes, and rotaxanes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3b"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3b</span></sup></a> This part has been reviewed in depth by us in 2016, and herein we will discuss recent and interesting examples of host–guest types of structures.</span>

The current techniques used to detect gases and organic volatiles are based on high-performance liquid and gas chromatography; however, these techniques are quite expensive and time-consuming, leading to the need to develop new techniques or materials which are more convenient and simple.

        <span>Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have encouraged researchers to use NDI derivatives due to their properties such as tuneable spectra and processability in solution, which may lead to large area detection due to ease of fabrication of lightweight and mechanically flexible devices. Conjugated polymers based on alternate donor–acceptors (D–A) with organic materials have shown to be an excellent choice because they possess high photo-responsivity from the UV-Vis to the NIR spectrum, and these polymers can use either two donor units and one electron acceptor or <span class="italic">vice versa</span>, which is advantageous for low dark current and high-performing OPDs.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In this regard, there has been much development, and a few important examples are illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig58">Fig. 58</a>. For instance, the Shen, Peng and Huang group synthesised a series of random copolymers based on one electron-donating tellurophene and two different electron-deficient PDI/NDI moieties (<strong>273</strong>). Importantly, all the polymers displayed excellent solubility in common organic solvents including chloroform, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit188"><sup><span class="sup_ref">188</span></sup></a> Changing the proportion of the two electron-accepting moieties led to polymer films with tunable photophysical properties and photodetector performance.

Finally, a photodetector based on P70 was shown to be highly responsive, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> about 19.1 A W<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 600 nm with excellent detectivity ranging from 350 to 600 nm, making this device amongst those showing the highest values for OPDs for UV-vis light detection in comparison with inorganic counterparts. The Qiao and Wang group synthesised a series of n-type semiconducting conjugated polymers containing NDIs with three different side chains, 5-decylpentadecyl (<strong>274</strong>), 2-octyldodecyl (<strong>275</strong>) and 4-(2-octyldodecyloxy)phenyl (<strong>276</strong>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">189</span></sup></a> The results demonstrated that structural changes on the side chain influenced the packing of the structure, electron mobility and also the blend film morphology, thus influencing the properties of heterojunction polymer photodetectors.

        <span>In recent times, organic semiconductors have shown great potential for device scale applications such as in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDS), organic field-effect transistors (OFETS), batteries and supercapacitors, and organic photovoltaic materials. Unlike the traditional inorganic semiconductors, these organic semiconductors offer great versatility due to flexibility, extended π-conjugation, and the degree to which they can be tuned by modifying the functional groups attached to the semiconducting core. Naphthalene diimide (NDI) is one such versatile π-conjugated molecule which can be easily functionalized at the N-atom position to produce highly active, redox, organic semiconductor molecular systems with enhanced electron or hole mobility, charge transfer characteristics, optical absorption–emission properties and microstructural superiority facilitating the fabrication of organic devices which are efficient, lightweight, flexible and self-healing.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192</span></sup></a> Devices with memory storage and recognition properties<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> that are air stable,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit194"><sup><span class="sup_ref">194</span></sup></a> economical and environmentally safe for application in optics, electronics and other semiconductor technologies can be envisioned with NDI derivatives.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit105"><sup><span class="sup_ref">105</span></sup></a> Vener <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit195"><sup><span class="sup_ref">195</span></sup></a> studied the charge carrier mobilities of <span class="italic">N</span>,<span class="italic">N</span>′-hexyl NDI and <span class="italic">N</span>,<span class="italic">N</span>′-cyclohexyl-NDI to compare and evaluate their efficient operation as organic electronic devices. Charge transport in high-mobility organic semiconductor crystals is considerably hindered by non-local electron–phonon interaction (NLEPI) transforming dynamic disorder induced by low-frequency (LF) vibrations into fluctuations of charge transfer integrals. They have shown that the contribution of various modes to the NLEPI correlates with their experimental Raman intensities, suggesting that LF Raman spectroscopy can be used to study NLEPI. Using molecular modelling, Xie <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit196"><sup><span class="sup_ref">196</span></sup></a> showed that pyrene diimide (PyDI) is a more competitive core to assemble 1D n-type materials with desired charge transfer properties.

        <h3 id="sect2351"><span class="b_heading">7.2 NDI based organic field effect/thin film transistors</span></h3>
        <span>A field effect transistor is a triad which controls the flow of current by the application of an electric field. It consists of a source, a drain and a gate. By applying a suitable voltage to the gate, the current flowing through the source to the drain can be controlled in order to act as either an amplifier or a switch. The most popular among all are the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). However, the use of expensive metal oxides and high input impedance due to limited charge carrier mobility have limited the applicability of MOSFETs. In recent times, organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic thin film transistors (OTFTS) have been considered promising in electronic devices because of their low energy consumption, large active area, flexibility and cost effectiveness. Over the years, several p-type and n-type organic field effect transistor materials have been developed. The n-type organic semiconductors made of pyromellitic diimides, anthracene diimides, PDIs and NDIs in particular have been found to exhibit significant advantages due to the rigid planar structure and delocalized π-electron mobility which is extremely important for electronic applications.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,4b</span></sup></a> However, these materials suffer from reduced stability and lifetime under ambient conditions due to electron scavenging by O<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit227"><sup><span class="sup_ref">227</span></sup></a> Therefore, a great deal of research effort has been directed toward improving the charge carrier mobilities, solubility and stability of NDI based thin films for OFETs. Several synthetic strategies such as functionalization of NDI molecules with thiophene and halogens such as fluorine based organic molecules and their polymeric derivatives have been employed to lower the LUMO level and enhance the electron injection across the organic and electrode layer interface. Alkyl side chain engineering at the N-atom of NDI in particular (either linear or branched) and also the number of carbon atoms have been found to influence the thin film microstructure and in-plane anisotropy, both of which significantly influence the electron mobility as well as film stability. This section summarizes some of the important studies reported so far on NDI based OFETS, and some important examples are illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig72">Fig. 72 and 73</a>.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">NDI–thiophene based OFETS in their early development stages showed encouraging performance for device scale application.

The unipolar characteristics in (<strong>318</strong>) had almost halved mobility values compared to (<strong>317</strong>) suggesting that the delocalization of HOMO and LUMO could be used in controlling polarity change in organic FETs. Kim and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> reported the synthesis of a novel NDI-based molecule functionalized with a bithiophene linker unit (<strong>319</strong>) and demonstrated its utility in solution-processable n-channel OFETs.

        <p class="otherpara">Sommer and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit231"><sup><span class="sup_ref">231</span></sup></a> carried out thionation of the n-type conjugated polymer PNDIT2 (<strong>322</strong>) using Lawesson's reagent (LR).

        <span>For almost a century, batteries have served as alternatives to fossil fuels as advanced energy sources. Lithium ion batteries in particular have been most successful in powering the day-to-day needs of humankind and can be found in several electrical appliances such as mobile phones and laptops. Fundamentally, a battery consists of a cathode and an anode, an electrolyte, a separator and two current collectors. The efficiency of a battery depends on the electrode kinetics and its stability over long cycling periods.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> The traditionally used metal oxide cathodes and graphite/carbon anodes are approaching their performance limits for both batteries and supercapacitors. Hence, new advanced electrodes that can achieve a high energy/power density, light weight, a long charge–discharge lifetime, economical price and environmental safety have become the focus of current research in battery technology.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Recently, organic redox active rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have exhibited promising potential for sustainable energy technology. These organic electrodes do not need transition metal oxides and are able to undergo reversible charge–discharge performance on demand. Several organic small molecules and polymers which are redox active have been synthesized over the past decade for Li ion battery electrodes. 1,4,5,8-Naphthalene diimide (NDI) in particular has emerged as one of the most promising redox active organic molecules for this application. Despite its high theoretical capacity, NDI has often been criticized for its solubility in common battery electrolytes, which results in electrode instability and poor cycling performance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272</span></sup></a> Therefore, several modifications such as synthesizing NDI based (i) polymeric redox active molecules, (ii) covalent organic frameworks and (iii) organic–inorganic hybrids with improved rate capacity and cycling stability have been developed so far. This section summarizes the progress and development of such NDI based organic redox materials for battery applications.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The early improvement in NDI based redox active molecules was initiated with the synthesis of <span class="italic">N</span>-substituted NDI sodium salts of carboxylic (<strong>414</strong>) and sulfonic acid (<strong>415</strong>), which were designed as active positive electrodes for lithium-half cells by Dolhem Bonnet <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273</span></sup></a> The composite electrodes fabricated with the above two NDI derivatives and carbon black exhibited good electrochemical performance <span class="italic">vs.</span> Li<small><sup>+</sup></small>/Li<small><sup>0</sup></small> with a specific capacitance of 147 mA hg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for dicarboxylate and 113 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the disulfonate derivative. This study demonstrated the positive effect of small redox-active units on the cycling stability (99%) of organic molecules. However, the low number of cycles (−50 cycles) is too low for any device scale application and hence further optimization of the electrode is required. The above issues have been overcome in the work of Kothandaraman <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit274"><sup><span class="sup_ref">274</span></sup></a> where they synthesized three different aromatic diimide lithium carboxylates, namely the dilithium salt of <span class="italic">N,N</span>′-bis(glycinyl)biphenyl diimide, the dilithium salt of <span class="italic">N,N</span>′-bis(glycinyl)pyromellitic diimide and the dilithium salt of <span class="italic">N,N</span>′-bis(glycinyl)naphthalene diimide (<strong>416</strong>) with three different aromatic cores, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> biphenyl, benzene and naphthalene, respectively.

The distinguishing feature of this material is that the Li intercalation/de-intercalation process is biphasic. The excellent electrochemical performance of (<strong>416</strong>) is attributed to (i) improved anion–dianion kinetics due to the presence of the –CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>COOLi group, (ii) reduction in the HOMO–LUMO band gap, (iii) greater electron affinity of the –CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>COOLi group and (iv) greater aromaticity of the naphthalene core. The same research group also tested the above synthesized diimides for Na ion battery applications. In this synthesis method the Li ions were substituted by Na ions to form disodium diimide carboxylates, the disodium salt of <span class="italic">N,N</span>′-bis(glycinyl)pyromellitic diimide (Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>-BPDI) and the disodium salt of <span class="italic">N,N</span>′-bis(glycinyl) NDI (<strong>414</strong>).

        <h3 id="sect3178"><span class="b_heading">7.4 NDI based organic solar cells</span></h3>
        <span>The era of modern solid state photovoltaics (PV) began with the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in silicon in 1954. The high manufacturing cost of Si PVs has led to the interest in a new class of photovoltaics which are based on organic materials. Also known as polymer solar cells, they constitute several advantages over the classical Si based PVs in terms of being inexpensive, flexible, lightweight, and thus suitable for grid power generation. The efficient functioning of a polymer solar cell (PSC) depends largely on the choice of donor and acceptor which should have suitable optical, electronic and morphological properties. NDI and its polymeric derivatives offer unique physico-chemical properties such as structural planarity, delocalized π-electron mobility and tunable LUMO energy levels which make them a very efficient electron acceptor class of compounds for solar cells. When a p-type electron donor polymer and an n-type electron acceptor NDI based polymer are incorporated into the active layer in an all-polymer solar cell (all-PSC), excellent photovoltaic performance and high solar power conversion efficiencies (PCE) are achieved compared to fullerene-based solar cells. Therefore, several functionalized NDI based polymers such as cyanated polyphenylenevinylenes, benzothiadiazole containing polymers, aromatic diimides with side functional groups as (i) thiophenes, (ii) seleno-thiophene, (iii) fluorinated NDIs, and (iv) porphyrin based NDIs have been synthesized and characterized, and their photovoltaic performance has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit4a"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4a,295</span></sup></a> All-polymer solar cells have been recently reviewed by Zhang and Li,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit296"><sup><span class="sup_ref">296</span></sup></a> yet here we provide a detailed literature survey of NDI-based polymers reported to date for organic solar cell applications.</span>

The permanent dipole moment at the interface of ZnO and PFTNDI (<strong>514a</strong>) is mainly due to the interaction of the tri-methyl ammonium bromide salt in PFTNDI and the hydrophilic ZnO surface, which results in a reduced work function of the ZnO layer.

SCLC measurements showed that the BDDT:(<strong>468</strong>) blend had better charge transfer properties among the three acceptors, whereas the (<strong>467</strong>) based blend film showed the most unbalanced charge carrier transfer, which resulted in lower performance for the (<strong>467</strong>) based blend.

The electron rich benzodithiophene group was supposed to enhance the charge carrier mobilities of the resulting polymers. They found deep LUMO energy levels from −3.55 to −3.97 eV for these acceptors. The all-PSCs were fabricated using PTB7-Th, which exhibited matching energy levels and complementary spectra.

The high performance for the PFPDI–BDT-based blend may be ascribed to the higher photoresponse from 350 to 750 nm, less charge recombination, and favourable morphology of the blend film.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit321a"><sup><span class="sup_ref">321a</span></sup></a> In another report they synthesized three n-type polymer acceptors: PDTNDI-T (<strong>465a</strong>), PDTNDI-TT (<strong>465b</strong>), and PDTNDI-DTT (<strong>465c</strong>).

They found that the structurally regioregular polymer shows enhanced thin film crystallinity and higher electron mobility compared to the random polymer, with longer absorption and a stronger absorption coefficient than those of (<strong>368b</strong>). The self-assembly formation of structurally regioregular polymer P2, when processed with DIO additive, leads to highly organized nanofibrillar network structure and molecular ordering in the thin film with a PTB7-Th donor.

The photovoltaic investigation showed that the P2:PDIDTP based device showed the highest PCE of 4.05% among these all polymer acceptor based devices.

Interestingly, the cNDI-TTF (<strong>601</strong>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit388"><sup><span class="sup_ref">388</span></sup></a> system shows excellent redox behavior and a strong photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer, in which the formation of cation radical was observed at 852 nm (cNDI-TTF)<small><sup>•+</sup></small> upon chemical oxidation with FeCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> due to significant π–π interaction, and a near-IR absorption (1270 nm) band was observed. In another example, a cNDI bearing dyad with zinc-tetraphenylporphyrin was produced (<strong>602</strong>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit389"><sup><span class="sup_ref">389</span></sup></a><span class="italic">via</span> a 2,3-annulated linkage, and upon photoexcitation of the porphyrin in DCM, the charge separation (CS) from the ZnTPP to the cNDI unit was in the range of 1–3 ps.

After photoexcitation, charge separation takes place from porphyrin to cNDI in tetrahydrofuran and benzonitrile solvents, with charge separation of ∼1 ps and ∼25 ps time constants in the ZnP and FbP triads, respectively, and charge recombination with time constants of about ∼7 and 16 ps.

        <h3 id="sect5620"><span class="b_heading">11.1 G-quadruplex binding</span></h3>
        <span>Naphthalene diimides showed significant anticancer activity in animal models, with therapeutic potential related to their ability to strongly interact with G-quadruplexes. G-quadruplexes provide scaffolding for two-dimensional organic frameworks of four-stranded nucleic acid structures due to the strong hydrogen-bonding ability of guanine-rich sequences. G-quadruplexes can be formed from telomeric repeats in various organisms both <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and <span class="italic">in vivo</span>. Importantly, the human telomeric repeat is made up of the repeated sequences CGTTAG, and for therapeutic purposes binding of molecules within the G-quadruplex to specific sequences of DNA with high affinity and stability is an important goal of biological chemists for the transcription factor proteins to modulate the transcription of genes. Thus, researchers have been working to elucidate the complex regulation of mammalian gene expression, as well as to develop targeted diagnostics and generic aberrations in the field of medicine. Among the planar aromatic molecules, NDI has been shown to be versatile due to high affinity and selectivity for G-quadruplex binding.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A series of core-substituted NDIs and unsubstituted NDIs have been studied because of their promising biophysical and biological features. The Richer group has written a short review on the selectivity of NDI with G-quadruplex.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit408"><sup><span class="sup_ref">408</span></sup></a> In this section we present the latest developments on NDIs and their mode of binding with quadruples and their consequent anticancer activity. Earlier work by Neidle and co-workers gave confirmation of the binding of a G-quadruplex with a tetra-substituted NDI ligand (<strong>624</strong>) complex with two human telomeric DNA quadruplexes,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit409"><sup><span class="sup_ref">409</span></sup></a> and since then many researchers have been using NDIs or cNDIs for binding with G-quadruplex. Recently, the same group synthesised trisubstituted NDI derivatives (<strong>626</strong>), which contain two side chains terminating in morpholino groups at the diimide positions (<strong>625</strong>) and a third side chain terminating in a protonated pyrrolidino group.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit410"><sup><span class="sup_ref">410</span></sup></a> They have used this trisubstituted NDI derivative for the treatment of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer genes having over-representation of G-quadruplexes and shown a superior profile compared to the commonly used therapy ‘gemcitabine’. This type of NDI molecule may thus be appropriate for use in the treatment of currently hard-to-treat cancers. In another report, they used <span class="italic">N,N</span>′-bis(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethylamino)-2,6-bis(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethylamino)-NDI (<strong>623</strong>), which shows micromolar inhibition of cell growth in a wild-type patient-derived GIST cell line and also shows a sub-micromolar activity in two distinct patient-derived imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal cancer cell lines.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit411"><sup><span class="sup_ref">411</span></sup></a> This NDI derivative strongly stabilises both G-quadruplexes, which include one from the BCL-2 promoter DNA and another from quadruplex from its 50-UTR region of the RNA (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig140">Fig. 140</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Takenaka and co-workers synthesised seven NDI ligands (<strong>628–634</strong>) by varying the chain length between NDI and a ferrocenyl group (FNDI).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit413"><sup><span class="sup_ref">413</span></sup></a> In their study, they found that the FNDI binds to tetraplex DNA with high selectivity and affinity (&gt;10<small><sup>5</sup></small> M<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in 0.10 M AcOK-AcOH containing 0.10 M KCl) compared to either single- or double-stranded DNA. Based on this assay, they found that FNDI ligands can be categorised into three main categories for inhibition of both telomerase and Taq polymerase (<span class="italic">Thermus aquaticus</span>, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> thermostable DNA polymerase), inhibition of telomerase alone, or inhibition of none of them.

The Estrela group synthesised an NDI containing a ferrocenyl group with an oligoethylene chain as a spacer as an intercalation unit for the development of an electrochemical DNA biosensor with a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequence to monitor the DNA recognition, where ferrocene oxidation was used for the quantification of DNA recognition (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig56">Fig. 56</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit184"><sup><span class="sup_ref">184</span></sup></a> Interestingly, this novel NDI derivative demonstrated good DNA recognition with a limit of detection of 11.68 fM. In this report, the group synthesised three cyclic NDI dimers with varying alkyl chains (<span class="italic">n</span> = 3, 5 or 7) between the linkers and used them to bind G-quadruplex. Their findings demonstrated that all of the cNDI dimers show recognition of G-quadruplex, preferably with higher thermal stability compared to cNDI monomers. These NDI dimers also exhibited stronger inhibition toward telomerase activity, and stop telomere DNA elongation compared to the monomer, as well as show improved anticancer potential. Thus, these types of cNDI dimers may be useful for future anticancer applications. In another report they have synthesised cNDI dyads with alkyl chain spacers (<span class="italic">C</span> = 4–7) (<strong>639</strong>), where the C<small><sub>7</sub></small> linker showed low IC<small><sub>50</sub></small> values at &lt;10 nm conc.

        <span>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer death, but there are only a few drugs available for its treatment. NDI has been used as an anticancer agent and shown to be effective for selective binding of double-strand DNA or G-quadruplex. An NDI bearing polyamine groups has shown potent inhibition of cancer cells both <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and <span class="italic">in vivo</span>. Learning from this, Freccero and Manet synthesised a water-soluble NDI containing tetracationic quaternary ammonium functional groups (<strong>663</strong>, <strong>664</strong>) which were used for theranostic applications (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig145">Fig. 145</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit428"><sup><span class="sup_ref">428</span></sup></a> They found that these new NDI derivatives selectively bind to G-quadruplex DNA over double-stranded DNA. They have also studied sensitizing ability, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity. Overall, these near-IR red fluorescence emitters accumulate into cell nuclei and upon irradiation of NDI cell viability was reduced &gt; 40% and cell expression of γH2AX foci was enhanced, indicating DNA damage at μM concentrations in conjugation with low dark cytotoxicity. The study shows for the first time that charged tetracationic NDI with intense emission in the red/NIR upon irradiation might induce DNA damage in specific sites, perhaps leading to development of new NDIs for HCC treatment in the future. The Milelli group <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit429"><sup><span class="sup_ref">429</span></sup></a> synthesised NDI derivatives bearing polyamine functional groups, <span class="italic">i.e. o</span>-methoxybenzylamino-propyl moiety on one imide and a spermine functional group on the other (<strong>665a–e</strong>), which show cell phenotype-reprogramming properties, demonstrating prevention of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer cells. When they compared G-quadruplex binding with various NDI derivatives of varying chain lengths between the amino group and the NDI core, as well as the number of amino groups, they revealed an interesting trend: 3 &lt; 4 ≈ 5 ≪ 6. Using a similar strategy, Dai and Luo synthesised new asymmetric NDI derivatives and employed them for anticancer activities, and they found that the activity is significantly affected by the substituent groups at the NDI diimide positions (<strong>665f–q</strong>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit430"><sup><span class="sup_ref">430</span></sup></a> The NDI derivative bearing alkyl chains at one end and an ammonium group at the other end (<strong>665g</strong>) showed a stronger inhibitory effect on hepatoma cells SMMC-7721 and Hep G2 with IC<small><sub>50</sub></small> values of 1.48 ± 0.43 μM and 1.70 ± 0.53 μM, respectively, as compared to non-cancer cells QSG-7701 with an IC<small><sub>50</sub></small> value of 7.11 ± 0.08 μm. Importantly, treatment of SMMC-7721 cells and Hep G2 cells with (<strong>665g</strong>) gives apoptotic cells with values of 52.1% and 67.8% at 3 μm of (<strong>665g</strong>), respectively. This is evidence that (<strong>665g</strong>) induced autophagy and suppressed the migration of hepatoma cells depending on the concentration of produced ROS, and thus this molecule may be used as a potent anticancer agent in future. Mondal and co-workers described the synthesis of NDI-bis-hydrazimide (<strong>665s</strong>) which showed antineoplastic properties which negatively affected the cell viability of three cancer cell lines (AGS, HeLa and PC3) and also induced S phase cell cycle arrest along with SubG0/G1 accumulation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit431"><sup><span class="sup_ref">431</span></sup></a> This new NDI derivative showed the highest sensitivity towards a gastric cancer cell line, in which NDI induced extensive DNA double strand breaks causing p53 activation to transcription for target gene p21 in AGS cells <span class="italic">via</span> ROS upregulation.</span>

      <h2 id="sect6446"><span class="a_heading">14 Conclusion and outlook</span></h2>
      <span>In this review we have taken a comprehensive look at recent applications of NDI in key areas, and shown that the outlook in many emerging technologies is promising due to the key features of NDI derivatives that make them so versatile and functional. Synthetic versatility afforded by recent advances in substitution at the core and traditional functionalisation of NDI through the imide nitrogen atoms allows exploitation of π-stacking, as well tuning of electronic, charge transfer and optical properties. Depending on the functional group appended, we have seen that access to supramolecular and polymer chemistry is possible which is almost unrivalled for a class of substances based on one primary building block. The details and diversity of the applications described in each of the sections outlined in this review are a testament to the fact that NDI and its derivatives will continue to grow in applications that such a building block can provide.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The next step in the development of NDI derivatives is advancement into practical applications. Up until now, although advances have been made in so many areas, our understanding of this class of molecules is ever increasing, and a maturity is being reached which will allow scientists to design, synthesise, and tailor NDI derivatives to a unique application where it is class leading, and this may come in almost any of the areas described above. Due to the tools and background that the field now has as its disposal, the authors feel that this breakthrough will not be too far away.</p>
