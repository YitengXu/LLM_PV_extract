      <span>
        <span class="bold">Qing Pan</span> opened the discussion of the introductory lecture by Devens Gust: You mentioned that the photochemical logic gates can switch in picoseconds, does this mean they could be used for electronic systems faster than gigahertz?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> replied: The rate constants for the photochemical reactions are indeed on the picosecond time scale, for many of the reactions. However, the actual time necessary for switching a macroscopic sample depends on the light intensity and the irradiation time. The more intense the light, the shorter the time necessary to achieve sufficient photoisomerization to switch an output ON or OFF. It would be very difficult to achieve switching times on the picosecond time scale for a macroscopic sample size.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Qing Pan</span> said: An ensemble of molecules are needed. Would the integration of many logic gates into a circuit create a heat dissipation problem which may also affect the stability of the molecules?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> responded: The photochemical reactions would indeed generate some heat that would need to be dissipated, just as heat dissipation is a requirement for electronic computers. Thus, mechanisms for cooling would be needed for any large, rapidly switching devices based on photochemical switches. Very high temperatures would, of course, accentuate any thermal decomposition reactions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jana Rohacova</span> asked: Have you also designed a logic gate system combining photochemical and chemical or other stimuli? Would such a device find any applications besides sensing, and would there be any advantage or disadvantage?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> answered: We have not studied many systems of this type, but others have done so and they give interesting results. We did prepare one logic gate that uses both light and magnetic inputs. Devices that have chemical inputs are excellent for sensing and perhaps tracking the history of a nanoparticle or something of that sort. Chemical inputs have a disadvantage for repetitive applications in that they require constant addition of chemicals as inputs and generate reaction products that must be removed if the system is to continue operation indefinitely.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Cornelia Bohne</span> commented: In your logic gates changes in intensity were measured at one wavelength. Have you thought about using the additional variable of time for your logic gates since for photochromic compounds irradiation at different times will lead to solutions that could have different colors?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> replied: The systems we have worked with have been invariant with respect to time, but you are correct that time could also be a useful variable. For example, at a given irradiation intensity, the time of irradiation will affect the amount of photoisomerization that takes place, and thus the absorption or emission amplitude at a given wavelength. In addition, some photochromes thermally isomerize, and with several of these linked, the color of a solution would change with time, and that could be useful. We have not done any experiments of that type, but they would be interesting.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">A. Prasanna de Silva</span> noted: The multi-photochromic systems described by Devens Gust show rich UV-vis spectral signatures for the various states. Using multiple wavelengths at the same time will enable quantum logic gate phenomena. A case with ion-induced variations in UV-vis spectra has been analyzed in this manner.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">1 A. P. de Silva and N. D. McClenaghan, <span class="italic">Chem.,–Eur. J.</span>, 2002, <span class="bold">8</span>, 4935.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> responded: This is true, and a good point. I also pointed out that the molecule I used to illustrate molecular logic can provide different logic functions at the same time using the same two inputs but different outputs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> enquired: In natural photosynthesis, green plants are optimized to function at low light levels and utilize photoprotection mechanisms (non-photochemical quenching) to quench excess excitation energy in order to prevent photodamage at high light intensities. However, in artificial systems, it would be desirable to utilize the full solar intensity because this would enable more efficient energy conversion. Would the kinds of photoprotection systems that are in plants be useful for artificial systems?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> answered: Analogs of pure photoprotection, such as carotenoid quenching of chlorophyll triplet states to prevent singlet oxygen sensitization, could certainly be useful for artificial photosynthesis. Regulatory systems as exemplified by NPQ in plants are not ideal for the production of solar fuels but are required because the plant is not a perfect device. Human-made devices are unlikely to be perfect as well. I could imagine that in order to make a technological device carrying out multiple-electron reductions function efficiently at lower light intensities it might be necessary to overdrive it at high light with antennas or sunlight focusing, and thus photoregulation of some type might be needed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> remarked: There was a question on whether it has been shown that molecular components do become more stable when immobilised. My comment on that is that the incorporation of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes in the Grätzel solar cell has shown that this is the case. Compounds that under irradiation are very unstable in solution are shown to be stabilised on TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> since charge injection to the semiconductor prevents population of metal based excited states that promote decomposition.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> replied: We have seen these kinds of effects as well. In addition, when sensitizers are immobilized, reactions between excited sensitizers and other sensitizer molecules are reduced or eliminated.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> opened discussion of the paper by Gary Brudvig: You show the interesting structural peculiarity of OEC, as compared to routine oxo complexes, of an oxygen ligand <span class="italic">trans</span> to the oxo of the dangling manganese. What can you say about this structure–function element with regard to the activity of OEC?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> replied: I think this is an important structure–function element for water-oxidation catalysts. In order to activate a terminal oxo ligand of Mn for O–O bond formation, it is important to avoid a strong triple bond between Mn and the oxo, as is present for low-spin square pyramidal Mn(<span class="small_caps">V</span>)<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e002.gif" alt="[triple bond, length as m-dash]"/>O species. The oxo in these Mn(<span class="small_caps">V</span>)<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e002.gif" alt="[triple bond, length as m-dash]"/>O species is known to be unreactive. In the OEC, a μ-oxo ligand <span class="italic">trans</span> to the terminal oxo of the dangling manganese will weaken the Mn–oxo bond of the terminal oxo and help to promote reactivity. A similar motif is observed in our Mn-terpy catalyst, where the terminal water ligand that is hypothesized to form a reactive terminal oxo ligand is <span class="italic">trans</span> to a μ-oxo.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> remarked: We recently have prepared a manganese oxo that models the dangler in OEC (yet to be published). The oxo causes enhanced lability of the ancillary ligands of Mn and we observe an ensuing acid-base chemistry that is ultimately manifested in redox reactions of the Mn oxo. Most mechanisms of the OEC Mn oxo dangler only consider redox and do not consider an acid-base chemistry induced by ligand dissociation of the ancillary ligands on the dangler Mn oxo. Have you or anybody else considered a redox chemistry of the dangler Mn oxo kicked off by an acid-base chemistry induced by ligand dissociation from the dangling Mn oxo?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> responded: Acid-base chemistry could play an important role in the mechanism of water oxidation by the OEC. For example, Pecoraro and coworkers have suggested that protonation of an oxo bridge could promote the reaction owing to the marked sensitivity of the reduction potential of the cluster to the protonation state of the ligands.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">1 M. J. Baldwin, A. Gelasco and V. L. Pecoraro, <span class="italic">Photosynth. Res.</span>, 1993, <span class="bold">38</span>, 303–308.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> commented: In our CoPi water splitting catalyst system and other synthetic OEC systems, the rate determining step of O–O bond formation occurs at the third hole equivalent. The Kok cycle implies a rate determining step of O–O bond formation on the fourth hole. Can you give any comment on the differences between the natural and synthetic OECs?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> answered: I note that if the resting state of the catalyst is already partially oxidized, then O<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation on the first turnover would require generation of fewer than four holes. Thus, photosystem II only requires the generation of three holes for the first turnover, but four on subsequent turnovers. In other systems such as mononuclear Ru water-oxidation catalysts, the O–O bond-forming reaction results in formation of a bound hydroperoxide that requires further oxidation to release molecular oxygen.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> asked: Are you able to be precise about the state of the catalyst at which oxygen evolution occurs? I refer to the number of photons and/or protons needed to activate the catalyst.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> responded: Yes. Our electrochemical studies have identified that the active catalyst is delivered from a one electron, one proton pre-equilibrium from a Co(<span class="small_caps">III</span>)Co(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) state. In addition, for all electrocatalysts, we have performed extensive kinetic studies to determine the reaction order in metal, proton, and buffer for not only for oxygen evolution but self-assembly. From these data, we have provided guidelines for self-healing. With regard to the number of photons necessary to activate the catalyst, this value parallels our electrochemical studies. The catalyst is part of a buried junction. Hole and electron equivalents are delivered from the buried photovoltaic. So the redox stoichiometry for the catalysts under electrode and buried junction configurations is exactly the same.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dario Bassani</span> said: A considerable number of experiments involving isotope effects have been reported in an effort to understand the mechanism of the oxygen evolving complex. Are your kinetic measurements consistent with these measurements?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> replied: Most of the prior experiments involving isotope effects on photosystem II have involved H/D measurements. These isotope effects are small and consistent with the S-state dependent substrate water exchange kinetics, as discussed by Hillier and Wydrzynski.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">1 W. Hillier and T. Wydrzynski, <span class="italic">Coord. Chem. Rev.</span>, 2008, <span class="bold">252</span>, 306–317.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrea Sartorel</span> asked: Does the electronic configuration (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> spin distribution/electron density) of the Mn4 cluster play a major role in promoting the formation of the O–O bond? Is there a significant change in electronic configuration before or after O–O bond formation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> answered: This is an interesting question, but I don't think it can be answered at this time. I think we can exclude a low-spin Mn(<span class="small_caps">V</span>)-oxo species because such species have been synthesized and show very little reactivity, no doubt due to the very strong triple Mn–oxo bond. Computational studies suggest that a Mn(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>)-oxyl species may be involved in formation of the O–O bond, but to date such a species has not been observed experimentally. On the other hand, a high-spin Mn(<span class="small_caps">V</span>)<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O species could be involved, as recently reported by Borovik and coworkers.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> remarked: You present your arguments in the form of a single mechanism operating for water oxidation and try to rationalize which of the two mechanisms is most likely under given circumstances. Is it not possible that both mechanisms operate simultaneously? Nature seems to be very good at adapting to specific requirements and so there seems to be a case for having multiple pathways just in case of problems.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> replied: Of course, this could be possible, although we have no evidence for or against multiple pathways at the present time. I hope we will be able to answer this question in the future with new experimental results to test the mechanism.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> asked: Can you provide some general information regarding the stability and turnover numbers or frequencies for photosynthetic oxygen evolution? In particular, what are the lifetimes of the intermediate states in the Kok cycle? Also, what kind of turnover is observed with respect to the manganese catalyst? This kind of information is crucial for the development of artificial analogues, where current turnover numbers are a few hundred at best.</p>

        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> replied: All of the intermediate S-states in the Kok cycle prior to the S<small><sub>4</sub></small> state are relatively stable with lifetimes on the order of tens of seconds to minutes or longer (depending on the redox poise of the sample). The slowest step in the Kok cycle is 1–2 ms, giving the manganese catalyst the capacity for a turnover frequency up to 1000 s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. However, this high rate cannot be realized because the rate-limiting step for photosystem II turnover is reduction and exchange of plastoquinone, which limits the turnover frequency to ∼50 molecules of oxygen per second. The turnover number is limited by photodamage of photosystem II, mostly due to formation of reactive oxygen species that damage the protein. Based on a measurement of the quantum yield of photodamage, one can estimate a turnover number of the photosynthetic manganese catalyst on the order of one million.</p>

In some cases, metal complexes are partially oxidized in their resting state, which facilitates entry into the catalytic cycle for water oxidation by requiring fewer than four holes for the first turnover.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> responded: This is a good point and also relates to the S-states in photosystem II, all of which are relatively stable prior to formation of the transient S<small><sub>4</sub></small> state that forms O<small><sub>2</sub></small>. If a synthetic water oxidation catalyst could be stable in all of its oxidation states prior to the state that forms the O–O bond, then accumulation of the first three holes may not be so demanding. As you suggest, if the resting state of the catalyst is already partially oxidized, then O<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation on the first turnover would require generation of fewer than four holes. Similarly, photosystem II only requires the generation of three holes for the first turnover.</p>

        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> opened discussion of the paper by Julia Weinstein: Why is the long-lived excited state of a Pt center needed to kick-off charge separation? In your studies the charge separated state is prepared on vibronic timescales (less than 50 ps). Why then is a long-lived MLCT excited state needed? For instance, why can’t the Pt metal be substituted by first row transition metals? Is the same effect seen? Why are long-lived metal to ligand states needed?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Julia Weinstein</span> replied: Long-lived CT states have been perceived for some time to be a requirement for, for example, DSSC. In our case, a long-lived MLCT is not required. The initial MLCT state is formed very quickly, and is short-lived, branching over several pathways on the time-scale comparable with vibrational relaxation. This is the key requirement for the effect to work. Replacing the Pt centre with a first row transition metal is definitely an exciting possibility which we must explore. One further consideration here comes from the fact that an open-shell transition metal introduces a large perturbation to the electronic structure of the molecule, leading to a very complex energy landscape. This complexity is a requirement to achieve excited-state branching to multiple products on ultrafast timescales. Moreover, having a heavy atom adjacent to the vibrations being excited is important because it helps in energetically isolating the nuclear mode, which as a result can retain its vibrational excitation for longer than in most condensed phase systems.</p>

        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> commented: In our work on the Ru–Co transition metal complexes we saw a strong dependence of the Ru to Co electron transfer rate on the type of bridge. A conjugated bridge results in an approximately thousand fold faster electron transfer than a saturated aliphatic chain. We interpret this difference as a result of the aromatic bridge being involved in low lying excited states, which speeds up the electron transfer substantially. I notice that when you introduce an aliphatic group in your bridge you obtain a slow-down of the electron transfer and reduction of the IR pump effect. Could this also be a result of conjugation between the donor and acceptor, and the different bridges being involved to a different extent in the excited state?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Julia Weinstein</span> replied: Indeed, when the –CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>– linker is removed, the donor (PTZ) becomes conjugated with the –CC– triple bond directly attached to the Pt centre. It is important that the consequences of such a change are multifold: it changes the energetics of electron transfer, the energy difference between the initially formed CT state and all other states involved.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> continued: The IR pump blocks the electron transfer to the acceptor. Can you from your data see where the excited state population goes? Is there a branched process and you see increased population of other excited state species? Can you speculate what the mechanism is to this change in excited state relaxation pathways? The IR pump is reminiscent of a coherent control experiment, do you think that such an experiment would shed light on the relaxation processes and potential energy landscape?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Julia Weinstein</span> answered: The excited state population that is blocked from forming the full charge-separated state instead forms a π–π* long-lived intraligand triplet state localised on the acceptor (<small><sup>3</sup></small>A). So indeed this is a branched process where a decrease in one product state results in an equivalent increase in another product state. The mechanism is thought to be a complex combination of effects which effectively drives the system across a conical intersection. One can speculate that the acetylide mode (∼1800-1900 wavenumbers) that is excited is associated with the co-ordinate for this reaction: it could be part of a collective motion of several modes that increases and decreases coupling between different excited states. What we know for sure is that as far as our experimental setup can resolve, the effect is impulsive; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> as soon as we introduce the IR pump, we completely modify the excited state evolution prior to intramolecular vibrational redistribution from the CC (<span class="italic">v</span> = 1) mode. So we believe we are intrinsically perturbing the vibronic interactions that dictate the electron transfer pathways. The fact that the system branches to several excited states is already an indication that fluctuations in the energetics of the chromophore or its environment can alter the excited state pathways – we do this in a controlled manner with the IR pump.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Coherent control experiments would certainly be interesting! These are different experiments to those that we are able to perform at present. It can be very difficult to extract information from shaped UV-vis pulses that are optimized by learning algorithms, so it would be challenging but possible to extract detailed information on the potential energy landscape. Much information could also be inferred, especially with controlled phase modulations in the weak-field excitation regime, on the role of vibrational or vibronic coherence in the excited state dynamics.</p>

Does it mean that the excited vibration is also the vibration active in the IR control or is it possible that the vibrational energy is first dissipated into other vibrations and/or causing some molecular distortion that affects the CT state evolution?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Julia Weinstein</span> replied: This is an excellent question. We do know that the effect is mode-specific to pumping the bridging acetylide stretch vibration in the 1800–1900 wavenumber range. Exciting other high-frequency vibrations in the 1500–2100 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> region <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, those attainable with our set-up, does not cause a response. However, one can not conclude that this is the vibration which is responsible for the effect, as the acetylide mode is anharmonically coupled to many low-frequency modes. There is a little more discussion on this point in our recent Nature Chemistry article, where we consider several systems.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

The ground and excited state potential energy surfaces were examined by scanning along the vibrational coordinate that corresponds to the vibration excited by IR pump in the experiments. These calculations showed a crossover between the MLCT state (the target of IR pumping) and the CSS (the state which is ‘switched off' in the experiments) as the coordinate is extended, with the degree of extension required for crossover in agreement with the relative efficacy of the ‘vibrational control' effect seen experimentally.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Julia Weinstein</span> answered: These experiments can’t directly probe the difference between electronic, vibrational or mixed vibronic coherences due to the limit in time resolution. However what it does tell us is that vibronic interactions seem to play an extremely important role in charge transfer in these types of complexes, and this is adding to a growing body of evidence that vibronic coupling occupies a central role across many molecular systems – from small organic molecules through to those operating in photosynthetic organisms. Similar experiments were performed in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics with shorter IR pump pulses where the charge separation is thought to be aided by vibronic coherence, similarly to charge separation in photosynthetic reaction centres.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Julia Weinstein</span> responded: The quantum coherences in PS are a really exciting area. The ∼1.5 ps time resolution of our experiments does not allow us to make a conclusion whether or not a coherent mechanism being responsible for the observed modulation. Indeed we are unable to experimentally determine whether the mechanism is related to any vibrational/vibronic coherence. An analogous experiment but with a much shorter time resolution may potentially contribute to the question.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> added: As you know, the nature of quantum coherence in photosynthetic pigment protein complexes as observed in 2D electronic spectroscopy has been intensively discussed. Two opposing pictures have been discussed in the literature, pure electronic or vibrational coherence. There is now a growing understanding that the origin in many cases is probably of mixed vibronic origin, and it is the mixing with vibrational coherence that contributes to the very long picosecond timescale dephasing times. That the coherence, whatever its nature, is present in some pigment proteins is clear, but its importance for the efficiency of photosynthesis is in my mind not at all clear. In our own work on the RuCo donor–acceptor complexes we have not observed any coherences so far, so the results do not provide much insight into this issue. Probably the electron transfer, a few hundred femtoseconds, is too slow for coherences to play a major role.</p>

        <span class="bold">Frederick Lewis</span> opened discussion of the paper by Villy Sundstrom: In the system with the conjugated bridge, while calculations show HOMO and LUMO orbitals localized on metal centre and not the bridge, the systems are conjugated. How do you view the interaction of the bridge with the two metal centres in the excited state? Is there ever electron density localized on the bridge?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> responded: I am not sure I fully understand the question in the way it is formulated. This is the way I see the difference between the two RuCo molecules, with the conjugated and saturated bridge. In the molecule with conjugated bridge, both calculations and optical transient absorption show that the excited state involves the bridge, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> there is electron density on the bridge in the excited state. Therefore the electron transfer from Ru to Co is very fast, on the few ps time scale. The saturated bridge lies much higher in energy and there is no sign of its involvement in the excited state, either from calculations or transient measurements. For the molecule with the saturated bridge the electron transfer is therefore a long-range electron tunneling process, which can be expected to be very slow due to the long distance between the metal centers (∼1.5 nm).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Frederick Lewis</span> asked: In the system having a saturated bridge are the bridge orbitals too high in energy to be involved in same way, or do they still play some role in mediating the electron transfer process? Since there is no through-bond coupling for the bridge consisting of two methylenes, the situation is reminiscent of the weak through-bond coupling in proteins, rather than the strong coupling between stacked bases in DNA.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> replied: As I described in the response above, this is precisely how we see it. In the molecule with the saturated bridge its energy is much too high to be involved in the lower excited states. This is apparent from the calculations and the optical TA measurements provide no evidence for involvement of the bridge.</p>

        <span class="bold">Cornelia Bohne</span> enquired: Can you comment on how much information is required from transient absorption experiments to make the assignments of the transient X-ray studies and if model studies are required? As a follow up have you encountered ambiguities in the assignments for the transient X-ray studies?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> answered: In general, it is always good to have as much information as possible from conventional transient absorption (TA) studies. TA is a powerful tool to get the dynamics of the optically bright states. The spectral information from the TA is often not very informative and that is where the X-ray studies can help. For assignment of the measured transient X-ray spectra it is key to have good reference spectra, which can be obtained by measuring ground state spectra of species corresponding to an intermediate or product of interest. For instance, if the photoinduced reaction implies the oxidation of a Ru<small><sup>2+</sup></small> species to a Ru<small><sup>3+</sup></small> species the measured transient X-ray difference spectrum is compared to the difference spectrum that can be constructed from a measurement of the Ru<small><sup>2+</sup></small> and Ru<small><sup>3+</sup></small> ground state spectra. Similarly, if a reaction sequence contains several species with different oxidation and spin states, ground state difference spectra are constructed from measurements of the relevant ground state species having the expected oxidation and spin states. This is generally a reliable method and of course depends on availability of the relevant ground state species. Measured reference spectra are generally complemented by calculated ones using, for instance, time dependent DFT.</p>

        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> responded: Stability of the investigated molecules is of course a key issue and very dependent on the particular molecule. In this case of the RuCo complexes the stability was very good under inert atmosphere and there was almost no degradation during hours of measurements. The difficulty of maintaining a constant sample concentration during the course of the experiments was perhaps somewhat unexpected, to avoid/compensate for evaporation of the acetonitrile solvent. This problem was solved by monitoring the absorbance of the sample and slowly adding solvent to keep the absorbance of the main visible absorption band constant.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Frederick Lewis</span> answered: Your first point is an important one. Since oxidation potentials have not been directly measured within DNA, we have used potentials for the individual deoxynucleosides measured in polar aprotic solvents such as DMSO or acetonitrile. We initially used values from the literature, but later measured them ourselves so as to have a consistent set of values measured under the same conditions. Base stacking, and to a lesser extent, hydrogen bonding, certainly will change the values within duplex DNA relative to those for the nucleosides or nucleotides. We use a lower value for adenine in duplex DNA so that it will be more similar to the value for guanine, thus avoiding having to account for the failure of G to act as a deep hole trap in an A-tract. I note that some workers have been less than rigorous in their choice of values for redox potentials, leaving a trail of self-citations that leads to a dead end. We have measured the temperature dependence of charge transport dynamics in several of our systems and find that charge transport is either weakly activated on unactivated, in agreement with current theories for charge transport.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">We have not determined the dynamics of charge separation in D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. Since the overall charge separation process involves several steps and global analysis of the kinetic data is necessary to obtain estimates for the individual steps, I think it unlikely that we would be able to assign a small isotope effect to a specific step.</p>

        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> addressed Dan Nocera: With reference to your stacked tyrosine-based arrays, do you see evidence for coupled proton/electron transfer? This might offer a quite different situation to what is found in DNA.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> answered: Indeed this is correct. The problem with tyrosine is more complex than DNA base pairs because it involves PCET, not just ET. For our tyrosine dyads with a rigid spacer, we see that the hydroxide group on the adjacent phenol moiety has an effect on modifying the electronic density (thermodynamics) within the dyad as well as coupling the two units <span class="italic">via</span> hydrogen bonding interactions (kinetics). The phenols in the dyad behave as a cooperative redox unit rather than two independent residues largely due to PCET. The first oxidation is highly proton dependent and facilitates the deprotonation of the phenol and its subsequent oxidation, while the second oxidation is proton independent.<small><sup>1</sup></small> You are correct, these tyrosine dyads are similar to two stacked guanine bases in DNA in form but not in specific mechanism. ET dominates for stacked base pairs whereas as PCET dominates for stacked tyrosines.</p>

Does the catalyst undergo some structural photochemical-induced changes involved in the photocatalytic cycle, or does it cause only an inner filter effect?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">To overcome the water-solubility issue, would it be synthetically possible to introduce a methylsulfonate or methylphosphonate substituent or similar (but at the same time not to significantly change redox properties) instead of a simple methyl group?</p>

        <span class="bold">Randolph Thummel</span> responded: A potential problem with the sensitizer and catalyst absorbing in the same region is more or less nullified by the concentration difference since the sensitizer is present in large excess. This does become a problem, however, in the design of photosensitizer–catalyst dyads where both species are restricted to being equal in concentration.

        <span class="bold">Randolph Thummel</span> replied: We do not claim that the Ru(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) species is the “resting state”. Actually, I am not very clear about the meaning of “resting state”. At a thermodynamic steady state, the distribution of intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle depends on their relative energy or Gibbs free energy change (equilibrium constants) for every single step. In earlier work we have estimated that the Ru(<span class="small_caps">V</span>)<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O to Ru(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>)–OO step has the greatest energy change. So I guess the Ru(<span class="small_caps">V</span>)<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O is dominant. At time = 0, there is only the Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) species. It may take some time to reach the catalytic steady state, even though electron transfer is usually fast.

        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> asked: This question relates to the mechanism of the mononuclear Ru water oxidation catalysts. We and others have found that when these catalysts are immobilised on an electrode surface they have no catalytic activity. This suggests a dinuclear mechanism for the O–O bond forming reaction. In this regard, it is interesting that the <span class="italic">t</span>-butyl derivative has no lag phase, but has very slow turnover, relative to the methyl derivative. Could this be due to the steric bulk of the <span class="italic">t</span>-butyl derivative that prevents dimerization? Perhaps, the lag phase is due to the precatalyst being converted into a catalytically active dinuclear species? Have you looked at the order of the lag phase?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Randolph Thummel</span> responded: For the type 1, 2, and 3 Ru catalysts that we have examined, they all follow first order kinetics which argues against a bimolecular O–O formation step. The tetra-<span class="italic">t</span>-butyl system is somewhat different in that it is slow but fairly stable. We interpret this as possibly meaning that the <span class="italic">t</span>-butyl groups may hinder a rate limiting attack by water but also inhibit oxidative degradation of the catalyst. Since there is no reaction during the “lag phase”, I am not sure how to evaluate this kinetically.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Randolph Thummel</span> replied: The commonly applied sacrificial oxidant, cerium(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) ion, oxidizes water to dioxygen only at a very slow rate. In our previous study,<small><sup>1</sup></small> CV of complex 3 showed salient catalytic current under moderately basic aqueous conditions (pH = 9). At pH 1.0, however, the catalytic current is suppressed and becomes insignificant.

        <span class="bold">Randolph Thummel</span> responded: The mechanisms for the mononuclear Ru catalysts and the dinuclear Fe–O–Fe catalyst are very different. The Ru catalyst has no coordinated water but after two one-electron oxidations is then attacked by water to give a 7-coordinate species. This process is sensitive to the steric environment around the Ru center, particularly the external N–Ru–N angle. For the Fe system we suggest that water attacks a dinuclear Fe–O–Fe<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O species.

        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> commented: Per Marcus–Hush theory, usually an O atom between two redox centres results in split redox waves. In your Fe–O–Fe dimer however, you see one two-electron wave with no splitting. Why is that?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Randolph Thummel</span> replied: The current amplitude observed for the first oxidation of the dimeric Fe–O–Fe catalyst is more than twice as great as that observed for the second oxidation process, suggesting that the first oxidation is likely a two-electron process. This process can be tentatively attributed to the simultaneous oxidation of the two Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small>-centers (Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small>Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small> → Fe<small><sup>IV</sup></small>Fe<small><sup>IV</sup></small>). The observation of a single two-electron wave can be explained in two ways. In one case the two Fe centers do not interact at all and thus both oxidize at the same potential but this explanation seems unlikely since the two Fe centers are separated by only one atom. More likely, the Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small>(ppq) core (Cl–Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small>(ppq)–O–Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small>(ppq)–OH<small><sub>2</sub></small>) could behave as a single species and undergo a two electron oxidation. This explanation would agree with electrochemical theory which states that the current passed for a one electron process is equal to <span class="italic">n</span><small><sup>½</sup></small> which equals 1.0 when <span class="italic">n</span> = 1.

        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> asked: Have you considered an ECE mechanism for the two-electron wave? Where the first oxidation occurs at the Fe–Cl(ax) centre, this raises the pKa of the water bound to the Fe–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O(ax) centre to produce an Fe–OH(ax) centre, which is more easily oxidized than the Fe–Cl(ax) centre. This might lead to a two-electron wave as you observe. Along these lines, if you add base and deprotonate the Fe–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O(ax) centre, do you observe an oxidation wave that occurs at a more negative potential relative to the two-electron wave?</p>

        <span class="bold">Marcelino Maneiro</span> commented: Several Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) complexes are reported as molecular water oxidation catalysts, but there does not appear to be a correlation between the different activity of complexes <span class="bold">3</span>–<span class="bold">6</span> and their structural/physicochemical features. I agree that the redox potentials (in Table 2 of the manuscript) and also the N–Ru–N angles in the equatorial plane are crucial to get good catalytic systems (particularly the large external N–Ru–N angle), but the data given do not explain the different reaction rates for <span class="bold">3</span>–<span class="bold">6</span> in water oxidation experiments. In the case of manganese complexes, we have proposed a better catalytic behaviour when the complex is able to easily coordinate the substrate molecule,<small><sup>1</sup></small> and this also could explain the different catalytic behaviour for <span class="bold">3</span>–<span class="bold">6</span>. For our manganese complexes we have established a correlation between the factor of tetragonal elongation and catalytic behaviour. High-symmetry octahedral geometries for the model compounds make the generation of a vacancy difficult and lead to inactive complexes. On the contrary, the more distorted the octahedral geometry the more active the model compound is. This hypothesis about the relationship between the catalytic behaviour and the symmetry of the structure is in accordance with the results of our studies in solution by EPR spectroscopy, but also we have been investigating how to establish a prediction about this activity on the basis of the crystallographic data of the complexes. For the case of the Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) complexes <span class="bold">3</span>–<span class="bold">6</span>, a higher distortion of the octahedral structure could lead to better achievement of the seven-coordinate geometry through water coordination. Thummel <span class="italic">et al.</span> could carry out CSM (Continuous Symmetry Measures) using .mol files in order to check this correlation. This point is crucial for the designing of new systems and also to understand the catalytic pathway.

A simple calculation of the differences between axial, inner equatorial and outer equatorial Ru–N distances for <span class="bold">3</span>, <span class="bold">5</span> and <span class="bold">6</span> lead to results that point out that the proposed correlation exists.</p>

A limitation of using acetonitrile is that proton coupled electron transfers cannot occur. Concerning the “active-Co” species, formed from the pristine cubane, we performed the cyclic voltammetry in borate buffer, which shows the appearance of the catalytic wave due to water oxidation. However, electrochemical characterization of the “active-Co” is hampered by the low amount of this species in solution (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 1% with respect to the pristine cubane).

These correlations are also maintained in the series of purified cubanes. We do not have evidence of pyridine detachment.</p>

        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> opened discussion of the paper by Johannes Vos: Apparently the energetics of the ligands do not determine where the electron goes. What might be the decisive factor steering the electrons? What are the esters doing? Could you envisage a systematic manipulation of the ligands to find out the mechanism of electron redistribution among the ligands? Does the nature of the metal on the acceptor group play a role?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> replied: The energetics of the ligands do drive the location of the excited electron and are important, but another important factor is efficient electron coupling between the various excited states. As observed before in solar cells, introduction of the ester groupings lowers the energy of the excited state energy of these ligands. In our case that process brings the MLCT located on the peripheral ligands closer to that of the bridging ligand. What we aim do with our systematic variation of the peripheral and bridging ligand is to optimise the electron flow from the photosensitiser to the catalytic centre by manipulation of the energy and the electronic interaction of both peripheral and bridging ligands. Yes, the change of the central metal of the sensitiser is important, for example iridium type photosensitisers behave very differently.</p>

        <span class="bold">Antonin Vlcek</span> commented: Scheme 3 of your paper shows a 32.5 ps interligand electron transfer (ILET) from a hot bpy-based MLCT state to the bridging-ligand based MLCT state, while no ILET occurs from the relaxed state. In this case, the low ILET yield would be due to structural reorganization and an energy barrier between the two states rather than to low electronic coupling. (Vibrational excitation would help in overcoming the barrier but it would have only a small effect on coupling.) It is possible that this type of ILET acceleration is a more general effect. Fast ILET from a hot excited state was observed also in the case of a mononuclear Re(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) complex.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> replied: Professor Ishitani is correct and determining the mechanism associated with our systems is one of the aims in our studies. So far photocatalytic studies have shown that electron transfer from the photosensitiser to the catalytic centre is on the ps timescale in the absence of sacrificial agents and this may suggest an oxidative mechanism. However, in order to be able to compare the photocatalytic properties of different compounds, we have used only one set of catalytic conditions using TEA as a quencher and this does not allow us to identify or differentiate between the two mechanisms.</p>

It is easy to imagine the first event that sends one electron to the catalytic centre but it is not straightforward to see how you get the second electron. My concern is that this arises from the sacrificial reagent and this is a serious problem in the field. A useful experiment might be to pre-reduce the catalyst by adding an electron and then checking if this interferes with the excited-state of the sensitiser.</p>

        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> responded: At present not much is known about the origin and location of the second electron.

This was also confirmed by D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O experiments.

The use of two chromophores to drive redox chemistry at one metal centre should follow a power law squared dependence on intensity. Does the quantum efficiency show an intensity squared dependence?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> answered: The electronic properties of the ligands coordinated to the Ru centre are very similar and a single set of MLCT transitions is observed around 450–470 nm, so they can therefore not really been considered to be “independent” chromophores. Upon excitation an MLCT state located on one of the ligands will be populated, depending on its energy and the electronic interaction between the different MLCT states. The 2e<small><sup>−</sup></small> reaction is therefore dependent on the absorption of a second subsequent photon, while the first electron/hydrogen atom is stored on the photocatalyst.</p>

        <span class="bold">Elizabeth Gibson</span> addressed Johannes Vos and Anthony Harriman: Since the chemical and photophysical behaviour of molecules are different on surfaces compared to solution, is there a requirement to optimise sensitizer–catalyst systems for a sacrificial agent if they are later going to be adsorbed onto a semiconductor? For example, Professor Harriman mentioned that a potential flaw in your supramolecular system is that the rather than the required second electron transfer from the dye to the catalyst taking place, the triplet state of the ruthenium photosensitizer could cause the electron in the catalyst to return to the ruthenium centre. However, when ruthenium dyes are adsorbed on TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (or NiO), the triplet excited state is rarely observed and instead the oxidised (or reduced) dye forms rapidly. Furthermore, if the reduced species is immediately formed, decomposition reactions could be entirely different or even prevented. Diffusion/dimerisation is unlikely to occur when the system is immobilised on the surface and the stability of both the catalyst and the dye could be increased. So since the preferred electron transfer mechanism (including the driving force for each step) is likely to be entirely different on the surface, it could be preferable to optimise the system on the surface first. This would avoid spending time overcoming challenges which are present in solution (with sacrificial agents) but are avoided when a semiconductor provides the oxidising/reducing equivalents.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> answered: There is a serious issue with such molecular systems in terms of charge accumulation at the catalytic centre, unless sacrificial redox agents are employed. It is not always appreciated that sacrificial reagents provide the secondary electrons (or oxidising equivalents) needed for the chemical process. You can imagine that the initial excitation causes transfer of one electron to or from the catalyst and that the sacrificial reagent restores the sensitiser to its original state. However, further excitation of the sensitiser is now followed by charge transfer with the one-electron activated catalyst to short-circuit the system. It requires bimolecular reactions to deactivate the catalyst.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> replied: I fully agree with Dr Gibson that the behaviour of these compounds may be very different when they are immobilised on active solid substrates as in our case NiO<small><sub>x</sub></small> and a wide range of compounds have been reported that can already be tested. However, most of the work carried out when designing and synthesising potential photocatalysts is on the actual synthesis, characterisation and photophysical studies of these compounds, so not much time can be saved in this manner. It also needs to be stressed that is important that before clear conclusions can be drawn from surface bound systems the actual photocatalytic centre needs to be fully characterised. Furthermore, I agree with the comments made by Prof. Campagna and others about this issue that both approaches are needed and importantly in order to avoid more variables being introduced by the immobilisation, well-defined and well-prepared NiO layers should be used for the immobilisation process.</p>

        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> opened discussion of the paper by Osamu Ishitani: We are still using sacrificial reagents to force fuel formation in artificial photosynthetic approaches. The first such systems were developed by Shilov in the 1970s, and I wonder if the time has not come to ban the use of such reagents. Do you have alternatives in mind? What do you feel you gain by using such reagents? Do you foresee the possibility to replace the sacrificial reagent with water or some genuine waste compound, perhaps like glycerol formed from bio-diesel production?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> replied: I completely agree with the opinion that we have to develop photocatalytic systems using water as a reductant in future for solving the problems of the shortage of energy and carbon resources and global warming. Recently, some groups, including us, have tried to develop such systems and considerable progress has been obtained for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction.<small><sup>1–3</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">If this opinion means that all the research to improve abilities and expand usable conditions is meaningless, I absolutely disagree with the opinion. We still need better photocatalysts for the reduction and oxidation of water and reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in various reaction conditions. Especially, the development of photocatalysts which can work in aqueous media as well as in organic solutions are required for coupling them with water-oxidation systems. However, most of the photocatalytic systems have been tested only in organic solutions. From this viewpoint, the most serious obstacle is the lack of a good sacrificial electron donor which can efficiently donate an electron to various photosensitizers such as excited Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>2+</sup></small>, and that the oxidized product does not inhibit the photocatalytic reaction. Although most systems used ascorbate as the sacrificial donor in the aqueous solution, it was not suitable as an electron donor because it limits the suitable pH range, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a basic solution is required because ascorbic acid is a much worse electron donor than ascorbate and the oxidized product functions as an oxidant.<small><sup>4</sup></small> We recently developed a much better new sacrificial reductant which works very well in a basic aqueous solution, but it unfortunately precipitates in acidic aqueous solutions.<small><sup>5</sup></small> Therefore, we need to develop better sacrificial reductants in aqueous solution to assess the real abilities of photocatalysts in water.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">(1) Faster electron transfer from the excited or reduced photosensitizer unit to the catalyst unit might be expected.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(2) The energy of the π* orbital in the bridging ligand is lowered.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(3) The rigidity of the bridging ligand causes the possibility of collisions between the photosensitizer unit and the catalyst to be lower.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Although the photocatalytic output of supramolecular photocatalysts should be affected by all of them, in some cases, one of them deals the photocatalysis a fatal blow. For example, Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)–Re(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) binuclear complexes with a bridging ligand gave much lower photocatalytic abilities even compared to a mixed system with the corresponding mononuclear complexes because of effect #2. The photocatalytic reactions using these series of Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)–Re(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) supramolecular photocatalysts proceed <span class="italic">via</span> reductive quenching of the excited photosensitizer unit.

        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> responded: As we wrote in the manuscript, the emission decay indicated that there were at least four conformers of the hybrid (Fig. 8 and 12). In these conformers, the distances of the excited Ru unit from <span class="bold">POM</span> should be different in each conformer, which causes different quenching behaviors. Fig. 12 shows a schematic representation of this consideration.

        <span class="bold">Silvia Marchesan</span> opened a general discussion of the papers by Andrea Sartorel, Johannes Vos, and Osamu Ishitani: During this Faraday Discussion, we have heard a lot about the advantages, also in terms of stability, of spraying a photocatalytic system on a surface, as opposed to having a (supra)molecular photocatalyst in solution. Do you see a scope for confining catalysts in supramolecular hydrogels, in bulk or as thin coatings on a surface, or for having switchable and reversible sol-gel systems?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> replied: I think it will be essential to confine molecular water-oxidation catalysts because water is more difficult to oxidize than organic C–H bonds. Thus, a freely diffusing water-oxidation catalyst in solution will degrade by ligand oxidation. Your suggestions for confining catalysts are good directions for future research.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stafford Sheehan</span> replied: Just as important as the stability of the photocatalytic system itself is the stability of its linkage to a surface or otherwise confined system. We have to keep in mind the advantages and disadvantages of different linking schemes, which are based on the conditions required for catalysis. For example, in caustic or acidic solutions that are required for efficient large-scale water electrolysis, certain metal–oxo bonds possess exceptional stability and may be the best (or only) option.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> commented: The use of hydrogels as electrochemically useful matrices on electrode surfaces was proposed, but comments have been made on the problems with strongly reduced charge transport rates.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The advantage of hydrogels is that they provide the opportunity to immobilise larger amounts of active ingredients such as electrocatalysts on electrode surfaces. As the downside of this approach reduced charge transport may be observed. This issue can however be addressed by a careful control of the layer thickness as well as manipulation of the structure of the polymer backbone, electrolyte and the solvent used.</p>

        <span class="bold">Andrea Sartorel</span> asked Dan Nocera: Regarding the proposal of using a triple junction PV module to evaluate HECs/OECs, do you think that reference cathodic and anodic compartments should be used to “rank” OECs and HECs, respectively? Can you indicate a benchmark catalyst for HER and for OER?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dan Nocera</span> responded: We don’t like the concept of benchmarking for heterogeneous based catalysts. Everyone wants to “rank” their catalyst or system to say that it is “the best”, but it’s very difficult to ensure that valid comparisons are made. To begin with, most do not know the structure of the catalyst. For instance, many have benchmarked metal oxides on “volcano” plots. But many, including us using HRTEM, have shown that the surface of the oxide becomes hydrous and porous under OER conditions. Thus the catalyst is not the oxide. In the case of Co<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>, authors have benchmarked the oxide against our CoPi catalyst. But we have shown that the surface of Co<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> is transformed to the CoPi catalyst. Thus they are naïvely benchmarking CoPi against CoPi! Indeed different activities are observed but that has nothing to do with the catalyst <span class="italic">per se</span>. It has to do with the mesostructure of the catalyst and the other factors. The lack of rigorous comparison methodologies, along with the unknown intrinsic activity of many catalyst systems, renders it impossible to accurately benchmark heterogeneous catalysts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">For homogeneous catalysts, the task is more manageable, as Jean-Michel Savéant has recently established.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">Sebastiano Campagna</span> made the general comment: Regarding the direction of the field, some very interesting results have already been obtained in the last five years. Some have been obtained using molecules, others using materials. There are several options. My opinion is that one direction or approach, even if at the moment it looks like the most effective one, should not limit research in other directions. It is too early now to select just one direction or approach. It is important to continue to explore all directions. Although, obviously, resources can really be a serious limitation. Sacrificial reagents maybe not practical but give useful information, and we need information on the mechanisms if we wish to progress. Clearly, we should be aware that working in solution can be different than working on surfaces or with electrodes and so on. However, the progress made in the last 5–7 years on photo-assisted water splitting (photoelectrochemical methods on electrodes decorated with molecules, for example) and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction with sacrificial agents in solution are impressive and belong to different realms and use different approaches. This would be enough to suggest that we need to explore all the directions and possibilities.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> added: I agree that it is too early to choose a final approach to solar fuel generation. It would be a mistake to focus too soon on a single technology, and possibly eliminate some that could later turn out to be advantageous. Indeed, it may well be that different technologies may turn out to be suitable for different purposes. For example, society currently uses several technologies for generating electricity, and each technology has its own best area of application.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Elena Galoppini</span> responded: I also agree with Sebastiano that we should explore all the directions and possibilities, even if may not appear to be immediately successful for a technology or an application. Important fundamental questions may be answered or the research will generate more fundamental questions that need to be answered. This is also very, very important, to satisfy our curiosity. It is probably the point of view of someone who always worked in academia!</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> commented: I agree with Sebastiano, too. I think that nobody can select the “best” system for the usage of solar energy at this stage and possibly there are several useful combinations of such technologies. However, we must not tell lies which will mislead people, and should always point out the importance and the “reality” levels of these technologies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Johannes Vos</span> replied: I fully agree with these comments.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> responded: I fully agree with Sebastiano, it is too early to choose track. I think very interesting work has been performed by combining different types of materials. Exactly which combinations will be the winners, only the future will tell.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> remarked: We continue to see a variety of wonderful molecular architectures designed on the basis of natural photosynthesis. These are highly imaginative and demand some really challenging synthesis and compound characterisation. Many such supermolecules have been critically examined by electrochemical and photochemical methods in order to elucidate the energy- and/or electron-transfer pathways. However, there are few cases, if any, where these beautiful materials have found applications for artificial photosynthesis. While great progress has been realised in terms of photoelectrochemical approaches, we are no nearer finding a solution for purely molecular approaches. While it is true that Nature uses a molecular approach, this knowledge doesn't help us – you could say the same about nuclear fusion on certain stars. Perhaps the harsh conditions inherent to water splitting are too severe.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> responded: It is true that water oxidation and fuel generation using molecules have some significant challenges, but we have to remember that photosynthesis uses molecules to make essentially all fuel for life, and is responsible for all the fossil fuels that we depend on today. Thus, it can be done.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alejandro Díaz-Moscoso</span> answered: Following your comparison with nuclear fusion in stars, well, reproducing star conditions in a controlled way on the Earth, that is a huge challenge! And we (mankind) are still optimistic about employing such a source of energy in the “near” future. So, shouldn't we stay optimistic about mimicking Nature in supramolecular water splitting when we already have the same starting conditions? I agree with the previous comment, it can be done. We just need interdisciplinary knowledge and imagination to find our way, although the work of billions of years of evolution must not be underestimated.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gary Brudvig</span> replied: I agree that water oxidation using molecular catalysts is challenging, but Nature has shown that it is possible in photosystem II which can carry out a million turnovers without degradation of the manganese-based catalyst. A key lesson that can be learned from Nature is that it is important to confine the water-oxidation catalyst to avoid intermolecular degradation processes. We have found that our molecular iridium water-oxidation catalyst is stable for long-term catalytic turnover when anchored to a metal oxide surface .<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Villy Sundstrom</span> replied: A purely molecular system may have problems doing the final job, but organic–inorganic combinations, where molecular systems mimic some key part of photosynthesis, may very well do the job. The dye sensitized solar cell is a nice example.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stafford Sheehan</span> commented: Throughout this meeting the stability and, as a consequence, practical applicability of molecular systems were brought up a number of times. Nature tackles these issues by embedding molecular catalysts within enzymes to increase their stability, analogous in some ways to binding molecules to robust surfaces. Such surface-binding and encapsulating methods have now been used in quite a few commercial products that employ molecular systems (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> catalysts and chromophores), and that are long-lived and durable. Examples such as these demonstrate that molecular catalysts can possess the stability required for large-scale applications, provided they are designed and evaluated properly.</p>
