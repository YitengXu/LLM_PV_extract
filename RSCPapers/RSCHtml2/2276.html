This work considers the prospects of developing a commercially-feasible water electrolyser with 95–100% energy efficiency (relative to the Higher Heating Value, HHV, of hydrogen) at the cells in the near future. We show that at least a 5–10% improvement in energy efficiency over the best, existing commercial water electrolysers would be needed. The elimination or mitigation of the direct and indirect energy losses arising from bubble formation in electrolysers would produce the needed energy savings. This work reviews the many strategies that have been proposed to improve the efficiency and cost of water electrolysers in that respect. Innovations in electrolyser design and engineering that seek to avoid the indirect losses are described, particularly innovations in the balance-of-plant that supports the electrolysis cells in an electrolyser. Thereafter, approaches aiming to avoid the direct energy losses are discussed, including: (1) the creation of hydrophobic locations on electrode surfaces to advantageously control where bubbles form and release, (2) the use of gas capillary actions to directly extract gas through a porous hydrophobic membrane as it is created, before bubbles form, (3) the creation of a superwetting surface morphology on electrodes to accelerate and control bubble dynamics, (4) the modification of the liquid electrolyte and its interface with the electrode surface to promote bubble formation and release, (5) sonication of the electrolyte to assist in bubble detachment and mass transport, (6) centrifuging to create a supergravity field within an electrolyser that maintains the electrodes and inter-electrode space free of bubbles, (7) rapidly pumping electrolyte over electrode surfaces to remove and separate bubbles as soon as they are formed, (8) applying continuous pressure swings to dynamically alter the buoyancy of the bubbles and thereby accelerate their release and removal; and (9) the use of magnetic fields to accelerate gas bubble detachment and transport. A combination of such an approach, coupled with innovative engineering to diminish the balance of plant, may potentially provide the improvements needed to realise truly energy-efficient, low-cost electrolysers.</p></div><hr/>
    
      <h2 id="sect320"><span class="a_heading">Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>The electrolytic splitting of water (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) into hydrogen (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and oxygen (O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) is a field of intense research interest as it offers a route to the production of hydrogen using renewable energy, thereby avoiding reliance on exhaustible fossil fuels. Hydrogen is attractive as a potential fuel because it is carbon-neutral; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it does not release carbon dioxide (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) upon combustion. The secular increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> since the industrial revolution has been identified as the key driver of anthropogenic climate change, as well as ocean acidification and sea level rise.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">The proposition that hydrogen could serve as a non-polluting and carbon-free energy carrier has formed the basis of innumerable proposals for a future ‘hydrogen economy’.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> As far back as 1874, author Jules Verne envisioned a world where “water will one day be employed as a fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen, which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">While hydrogen may have captured the public imagination, in 2006 Ulf Bossel raised a very pertinent question;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> namely: does a hydrogen economy make sense? In his exposition, Bossel argued that the high energy losses involved in generating hydrogen from renewable energy, as well as consuming it,made it fundamentally unfeasible as an energy carrier when compared with electricity (stored in batteries, for example) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> In particular, he observed that the sheer energy intensity and inefficiency of producing hydrogen by electrolysis was highly unfavourable when compared with storing electricity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> He argued that this relative inefficiency undermined the case for hydrogen as a future carrier of renewable energy, at least when compared to electricity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> His analysis did not take into account the relative capital costs and storage capacities of the technologies.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">At the time, in 2006, the most energy-efficient commercial water electrolysers were Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolysers. They operated at current densities of ∼2000 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and cell potentials of ∼2.00 V at 80 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> Given that 100% energy efficiency, according to the Higher Heating Value (HHV) of hydrogen, is the thermoneutral voltage of electrolysis (1.48 V at 25 °C; 1.47 V at 80 °C), this equated to an energy efficiency across the electrolysis cells of ∼75% HHV<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> (shown in the ‘Electrolysis’ block in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>). In the electrolyser industry, this is generally termed the stack efficiency since it considers only the net energy losses across the electrodes in the cells that comprise the electrolyser stack. There were further energy losses in the balance of plant (also called the balance of system), which is the engineering system that supports and controls the electrolysis cells. These included the energy consumed by the pumps, the gas–liquid separators and the power supply (‘AC–DC Conversion’ block in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>),<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> which typically amounted to, at best, a further ∼5% of the input electrical energy. Such electrolysers therefore had an overall system efficiency of ∼70% HHV.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> A further 10% of the input electrical energy was said to be lost in compressing the hydrogen (‘Compression’ block in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>) and 20% in transporting it to its storage location (left-most ‘Transport/transfer’ block in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The process of storing renewable energy in the form of hydrogen, according to Bossel, therefore had a net efficiency of, at best, ∼51% (left-most branch in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> That is, for every 100 kW h of renewable energy consumed, the produced hydrogen would contain 51 kW h of energy (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>, left-most branch). About half of the renewable energy would be lost in the storage process. By comparison, the losses in storing electricity as an energy carrier were substantially lower. For every 100 kW h of input renewable energy, the electrical energy carrier would contain around 77 kW h of energy (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>, right-hand branch),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> which is 26 kW h more than the stored energy in the hydrogen energy carrier.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The key difference between hydrogen and electricity as energy carriers was therefore the inefficiency of water electrolysers. For hydrogen to compete with electricity as an energy carrier, electrolysers would need to produce hydrogen directly at the storage location with stack efficiencies of ≥95% (HHV),<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> not 75%. For example, if an electrolyser capable of operating commercially at 95–100% stack efficiency could be developed, its produced, compressed hydrogen would store 81–86 kW h out of every 100 kW h input in the hydrogen it generated. Such values would be competitive with electricity as an energy carrier and would, arguably, be essential to the creation of a broad-based hydrogen economy. The higher energy density of hydrogen (141.86 MJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) relative to, for example, Li ion batteries (0.59–1.06 MJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) may, of course, favour hydrogen over electricity in particular sectors regardless of the relative storage efficiencies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In this work we consider the near-term prospects of developing such a high-efficiency water electrolyser. There have been important advances in electrolyser and hydrogen technologies since 2006. The issue of hydrogen storage and transport, which was a major concern in 2006, has today been largely addressed by the development of light-weight, high-pressure carbon fibre tanks and the use of the gas grid to store hydrogen.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> Current densities of ∼1000 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> are now considered potentially commercially viable for PEM electrolysers, while ∼500 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> are widely used in commercial alkaline electrolysers.

      <p class="otherpara">While a 5–10% improvement may sound like a relatively small gap, overcoming it will be non-trivial. Given that 95–100% HHV<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> equates to a cell potential of 1.47–1.53 V, the voltage needed to produce 1000 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> in the best commercial PEM electrolysers would have to decline by 0.11–0.25 V. That equates to a ∼4- to 20-fold increase in current density at 1.47–1.53 V, as the best present-day electrolysers generate only ∼100–290 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> at these potentials (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2(a)–(e)</a>). Even larger increases would be needed in alkaline systems. Such amplifications exceed those realised in the best commercial electrolysers over the last 20 years, which raises the question: are there any known inefficiencies in present-day electrolysers that, if overcome, could provide the required improvements in the near future?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">There is, in fact, one such inefficiency; namely, the effect of gas bubble formation and release. When gas bubbles form on an electrode in an electrolyser, they create a so-called ‘bubble curtain’ (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3(a)</a>) that masks the catalytic surface, hindering access of the electrolyte and increasing ohmic resistance in the inter-electrode gap. In so doing, the energy efficiency of the electrolyser is diminished. Recent experiments in which electrolysers were centrifuged to create a “supergravity” environment that maintained the electrode surfaces and inter-electrode volume scrupulously free of gas bubbles during operation, increased their (stack) energy efficiencies by 9–17% HHV<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> at current densities of &gt;500 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> That is, eliminating the presence of the gas bubbles amplified the energy efficiency of the electrolysers by more than the 5–10% that would be needed to make hydrogen competitive with stored electricity as an energy carrier.</p>

In this work, we review the different methodologies that have been examined.

We further consider the likelihood that one or more of these could be successfully exploited to create a highly efficient, inexpensive electrolyser in the future.</p>

        <span>Bubble formation on electrodes may be considered to go through the four stages depicted across the top of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3(b)</a>, namely:<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17,22,23</span></sup></a> (1) bubble nucleation, (2) bubble growth, (3) bubble detachment, and (4) mass transport of the bubbles away from the electrode and out of the inter-electrode space.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24,25</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">Gas-generating electrodes in electrolysers create bubbles by supersaturating the liquid electrolyte about the electrode with dissolved gas. Hydrogen and oxygen are only poorly soluble in water, with equilibrium saturation concentrations of ∼0.000817 mol kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and ∼0.00133 mol kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) at 20 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> They also have low diffusion constants (∼0.0000317 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and ∼0.0000178 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) at 20 °C).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> So, gas generated by an electrode has, effectively, no way to escape the vicinity of the electrode and instead supersaturates the adjacent electrolyte until gas bubbles are formed. The diffusion rates of supersaturated gases in liquid electrolytes are unknown, however they may be considerable given the high levels of supersaturation that appear to be needed in order to sustain bubble generation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Numerous studies of supersaturation at gas evolving electrodes have been undertaken. Bon measured a supersaturation of 60 atm for hydrogen at a current density of 40 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> at a hydrogen generating electrode.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> Shibata used a galvanostatic transient technique and found the hydrogen supersaturation to be 160 atm at 200 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> while the oxygen supersaturation was 70 atm at 100 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> Janssen and colleagues later measured smaller supersaturations for oxygen in alkaline solution, however their results were likely compromised by their technique, which involved a rotating ring cone electrode from which oxygen was readily lost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">In practice, the level of gas supersaturation near an electrode depends on many factors, including but not limited to: the reactor and electrode geometry, the wettability of the electrode, the applied current density, the volume/size/shapes/topologies of the other bubbles present, the flow field employed, the time elapsed since the start of electrolysis,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> the electrolyte used, and whether the bubbles nucleate homogeneously (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> in open solution near the electrode) or on the heterogeneous surface of the electrode.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> Modestino and Rivas have recently reviewed bubble evolution dynamics, including the levels of supersaturation and the factors at play.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Perhaps the most definitive studies of late have been those of White and colleagues who used electrodes of radius 7–41 nm to determine that individual hydrogen nanobubbles only nucleate at a Pt electrode surface when the supersaturation concentration reaches ∼0.21 M, which is ∼257-fold larger than the equilibrium saturation concentration at atmospheric pressure.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> That is, an H<small><sub>2</sub></small> supersaturation of 257 atm was needed for nucleation.

        <p class="otherpara">The additional voltage required to generate high supersaturations (formally referred to as the concentration overpotential) is not the only additional energy required as a result of bubble formation at an electrode surface. Beyond nucleation, the growth and detachment of gas bubbles at water oxidising or hydrogen reducing electrodes also diminishes the energy efficiency of electrolysis because, amongst others, it:<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17,34</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">(1) Decreases the effective surface area of the electrode as a result of the masking effect of the bubble/s, which create a bubble curtain (as noted earlier). This impedes access by the electrolyte to the electrode surface until the bubble/s are released, creating an energy loss.

        <span>The involvement of gas bubbles not only diminishes the fundamental energy efficiency of electrolysers, it also adds substantial costs and complexity to their design, as well as to their fabrication, operation, and maintenance. These consequential disadvantages of gas bubbles have not been widely appreciated to date, particularly by the academic community. Indeed, consultation of the scientific literature reveals an almost complete absence of studies addressing these issues. They are, nevertheless, highly significant and have undoubtedly severely impeded the development of high-efficiency and low-cost electrolysers.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">For example, until fairly recently, the problem of gas bubbles masking electrode surfaces had the outcome that traditional alkaline electrolysers that utilized buoyancy as the motive force for bubble release, were limited to current densities as low as 185 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> in order to achieve acceptable efficiencies. This had the further effect that, to generate industrially useful quantities of hydrogen, the electrodes needed to be very large – larger than 1 m in diameter in some cases. The sheer volume of metal in such electrodes (typically Ni or Ni-coated stainless steel), as well as their housings, fittings, piping, busbars and their balance of plant in general, added considerably to the cost of the electrolyser. Despite their enormous size and scale, such electrolysers still comprise a significant proportion of the commercial electrolysers sold today and plans are afoot to deploy them in gigawatt scale power-to-gas<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit5b"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5b,c</span></sup></a> and other applications.</p>

          <span>In more recent designs, the problem of low current densities at acceptable efficiencies has been overcome by continuously pumping circulating liquid over the electrodes, thereby sweeping away the gas bubbles as they are formed. The constant removal of bubbles allows for significantly higher current densities.</span>

          <p class="otherpara">The liquid containing the bubbles typically comprises a heterogeneous, micro-agglomeration of liquid and gas – a ‘froth’ – whose volumetric density may vary considerably and unpredictably over time. Meshes in the separation tanks burst the bubbles in the froth so that it separates into distinct, bulk liquid and gas phases. H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> gas is collected off the top of the H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the O<small><sub>2</sub></small> separator tanks respectively and often passed through devices known as ‘scrubbers’. These remove residual, aerosol particles of electrolyte that may be created in the gas stream when the bubbles burst. Scrubbers may take several forms, but a common one involves a particulate bed (sometimes known as a pebble bed) through which the make-up water of the system is trickled downwards into the separator tank. The aerosolized electrolyte particles encounter and dissolve in the water and are carried back into the separator tank. The gas streams must then typically be further dried of water vapour prior to use, including the water vapour introduced by the scrubber.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Liquid free of gas bubbles is drawn from the bottom of each separator tank and pumped back to their respective half-cells. Within each circulating loop, the liquid will typically be passed through a chiller, to cool it and thereby maintain a fixed temperature in the stack. The chillers are not shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a> for clarity. Chillers are refrigeration devices notable for their high energy consumption, large size and substantial capital and operating cost. In some electrolysers, the chillers make up the majority of the physical installation. In decreasing the energy efficiency of electrolysers and thereby increasing their heat output, gas bubbles can be said to contribute indirectly to the need for and size of chillers.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In commercial PEM electrolysers that use circulating de-ionized water, the return stream may also be passed through a Type 1 conductivity de-ionizer (ASTM Standards for Laboratory Reagent Water ASTM D1193-91: &lt;0.056 μS cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) to scrupulously remove all ions that are leached from the piping, tanks and fittings. If not removed, such ions, especially multivalent metal ions, bind irreversibly to the PEM ionomer membrane and degrade its capacity to conduct ions between the electrodes. Such degradation has been the cause of the relatively low lifetimes of commercial PEM electrolysers (≤25<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 hours) until recently; lifetimes of ∼70<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 hours are today more common. Type 1 de-ionizers are renowned for their very high cost. Their presence makes a major contribution to the notably higher cost of PEM electrolysers when compared to their alkaline counterparts.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">While engineering arrangements like that shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a> may amplify the gas output of electrolysers, they come with major drawbacks. Pumps, scrubbers, chillers and Type 1 de-ionizers add significantly to the system cost. They also consume copious amounts of electricity, lowering the overall system energy efficiency, and require maintenance, which can constitute a major additional operating expense. Moreover, pump failures may compromise safety, necessitating, in many cases, the installation of a second, back-up pump, with associated piping and engineering. Furthermore, because two gases are produced, each circulation system must generally be duplicated, doubling the materials and engineering cost. (Some PEM electrolysers with mechanically strong ionomer membranes may only have a circulation system for O<small><sub>2</sub></small> collection with the hydrogen gas collected directly.) The components of each of these systems must employ expensive, high-quality materials that are not corroded by the liquid used or the gaseous products (and do not leach ions in the case of PEM systems). They also need to meet the high safety standards mandated for handling hydrogen or oxygen. For example, an O<small><sub>2</sub></small>-certified pump, fabricated from materials resistant to corrosion by O<small><sub>2</sub></small> must be used for the O<small><sub>2</sub></small> loop. The H<small><sub>2</sub></small> pump must seal for H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and avoid hydrogen embrittlement.</p>

          <span>Beyond the resulting, very substantial additional capital and operating costs, pumping liquid–gas froths with time-variant densities and volumes, may also create transient or permanent pressure differentials across the ion-permeable, gas-impermeable inter-electrode membranes or ionomers used to separate the half-cells (“M” in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a>). Such pressure differentials may, in turn, increase ‘gas crossover’ between the electrodes, in which a proportion of the hydrogen generated at the cathode crosses over and into the oxygen stream produced at the anode, or some oxygen from the anode contaminates the hydrogen stream generated at the cathode.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Gas crossover diminishes both the overall energy efficiency and the faradaic gas output of the electrolyser. It may also be a serious safety issue since a hydrogen stream containing &gt;4.6% oxygen, or an oxygen stream with &gt;3.8% hydrogen, constitutes an explosive mixture (at the typical operating temperature of 80 °C).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Many commercial electrolysers monitor gas crossover in real time and are programmed to automatically shut down if the gas crossover exceeds 2% at any time. Gas crossover may fluctuate during normal operation because the relative densities and volumes of the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>- and O<small><sub>2</sub></small>-froths produced often drift in non-simple ways that can defy expectation.</p>

That is, while the overall voltage applied across a unipolar electrolyser does not increase with the addition of more cells or electrode area, the overall current does and this quickly becomes extremely expensive (and energy inefficient) when producing large quantities of hydrogen. Thus, industrial unipolar electrolysers have typically had to employ very large, expensive busbars to efficiently carry their huge currents (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 18<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000–100<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 A).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit52e"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52d–f</span></sup></a> Their power supplies further had to deliver such large currents at low voltage, which is the most inefficient and expensive form of power conversion.

      <span>With the advent of high-performing 3D electrodes capable of producing high current densities even with buoyancy-driven bubble-release, new electrolyser designs have been and continue to be developed. Some of these designs have the potential to significantly diminish the above complexity and even eliminate much of the balance of plant. In particular, the need to circulate water/electrolyte through the cell stack may be avoided, with the bulk-phase gases produced directly in or at the individual cells themselves. That is, in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a>, bulk-phase gases are first produced in the H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation tanks that accumulate froth from all of the cells. However, in the alternative designs, bulk gases are first produced in or at the individual cells themselves, thereby eliminating the need for circulating electrolyte with its associated pumps, pipes, tanks and engineering complexity.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Designs of this type were widely employed in early electrolysers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> and are still common in the chlor-alkali industry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> In water electrolysis however, circulating electrolyte ultimately became the preferred method for dealing with the gases that were generated, partly because of the variable volumes and densities of the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>- and O<small><sub>2</sub></small>-froths created.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">An example of such an alternative design is that of Shimko and colleagues, who incorporated small H<small><sub>2</sub></small>- and O<small><sub>2</sub></small>-separating tanks into each individual cell in their electrolysers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> That is, instead of having a single, common H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> separator tank for all of the cells present, each cell had its own separator tanks.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The Shimko cells are schematically depicted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55,56</span></sup></a> An ion-permeable, gas-impermeable membrane/ionomer separator (dashed line in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>) divided each cell into cathode and anode half-cells. The separator extended only to below the level of the electrodes and not to the bottom of the cell. That is, a gap was left at the bottom of the cell where the liquid electrolyte could move freely between the half cells. This arrangement was intended to eliminate the possibility of a pressure differential developing across the inter-electrode membrane/ionomer separator. Without such a pressure differential, gas crossover should be the smallest possible.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">When deployed industrially, in an array, the cells were connected to each other in electrical series (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> a bipolar arrangement).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56b"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56b</span></sup></a> However, each cell effectively operated independently of the other cells. Thus, the liquid electrolyte in each cell was not in contact with the liquid electrolyte in the other cells. Water consumed within each individual cell during operation was, moreover, automatically replenished within that cell, thereby continuously maintaining the electrolyte in the cell. This was done by an electronic level detector that automatically activated a deionized water dispensing valve (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>) when make-up water was needed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The key advantage of this approach was that it eliminated the need for circulating electrolyte, as seen in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a>. Parasitic shunt currents between the different cells in the high voltage array were therefore also avoided. This, in turn, allowed the cells to be ‘stacked’ to whatever overall voltage suited the most cost-effective or energy-efficient power supply, which was typically a DC-generating solar panel array.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56b"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56b</span></sup></a> The only major external components needed in the balance of plant were the power supply, a pressurised deionized water dispenser and two gas manifolds with associated gas storage vessels, one to collect hydrogen from the cell cathodes and the other to collect oxygen from the cell anodes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> The tubular design of the cells allowed for air-cooling, making a chiller unnecessary. Except for the gas manifolds and the cells themselves, everything else could be selected from the available, lowest-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf items.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">During operation, the H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> froths generated in each cell rose up the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>- or the O<small><sub>2</sub></small>-collection lines, from where they were diverted by gravity into the hydrogen and the oxygen separation tanks of that cell (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>). These tanks were, in theory, large enough to accommodate substantial fluctuations in the volumes of the froths produced. Within the respective tanks, the froths separated into bulk liquid and gas phases. The liquid phases were returned to the cell <span class="italic">via</span> the catholyte and anolyte return lines shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>. The separated hydrogen and oxygen gases passed through their respective pressure regulating valves into the hydrogen and oxygen gas manifolds, which collected these gases from all of the cells.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Long-terms tests showed that this design had two important drawbacks.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> The first was unexpectedly high gas crossover between the electrodes that periodically exceeded the safety limits. The H<small><sub>2</sub></small>- and the O<small><sub>2</sub></small>-froths that were produced on opposite sides of the separator must have had very different and also transiently changing average volumes and densities on, at least, some occasions. Even with the catholyte and anolyte in fluid contact below the level of the electrodes, there were, presumably, fluctuations in the relative levels of the catholyte and anolyte that led to the high gas crossover. This was most particularly a problem at very high pressures (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> &gt;100 bar).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">A second difficulty was that froth, with associated liquid electrolyte, periodically passed through the pressure regulating valves into the gas manifolds.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56b"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56b</span></sup></a> Such episodes also necessitated a halt in operations, followed by cleaning and restarting.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> While regulator failures were said to be responsible on some occasions,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56b"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56b</span></sup></a> the more likely larger cause was the small size of the separating tanks, which, undoubtedly, resulted in an overflow of froth at some times. Given that a stack of electrolysis cells cannot reasonably accommodate two large separation tanks for each cell, a more efficient method of separation was clearly needed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In more recent work, ‘filter press’-type bipolar alkaline and PEM cell stacks have been developed that incorporate cell-based separation volumes within the stack itself.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57</span></sup></a> Because of the limited space available within the stack, such separation volumes were necessarily small, at least relative to the size of the half-cells. It is unknown how successful these designs were in avoiding the problems of the Shimko design.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In the most sophisticated design to date, Seymour and co-workers sought to overcome the challenge of fluctuating froth volumes/densities and separation efficiency by:<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit58"><sup><span class="sup_ref">58</span></sup></a> (i) incorporating an expansion volume, balanced by an expansion resistor, at the base of their cell (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7(a)</a>), and (ii) controlling the flow of froth into the separators. The expansion volume accommodated changes in froth volume and density, by expanding and contracting under the influence of the pressure within the cell. The froth was taken off the top of the catholyte and anolyte by gas collection lines of restricted size (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> ‘hypodermic’ tubes) and deposited into relatively small H<small><sub>2</sub></small> or O<small><sub>2</sub></small> gas separators (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7(a)</a>). The liquid/froth level in the half-cells were determined by the height of the hypodermic tubes. This approach ensured that the separator was never overwhelmed by the volume of froth. Indeed, froth going into the separators was noted to commonly “self-separate” when passing through the hypodermic tubes, because the liquid components experienced greater resistance to flow than the gas components due to surface tension interactions with the tube walls.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit58"><sup><span class="sup_ref">58</span></sup></a> The liquid component was collected at the bottom of each separator by an “electrolyte-capture-and-return” system and pumped back into its respective half-cell (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7(a)</a>). The pumping action was provided by a single, common pump (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> a ventricular pump) that drove one-way pumping actuators in the electrolyte capture-and-return systems of all of the half-cells in a stack. The separated H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> gases passed into gas removal manifolds where they were washed to eradicate any residual, aerosolized electrolyte in the gas. The washing liquid was passed into a water dispenser that dropped make-up water, <span class="italic">via</span> a one-way dispensing valve, through a gas gap into the cell (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7(a)</a>). In this way, all of the electrolyte was kept in the cell indefinitely. The dispensing valve operated passively, opening only when the pressure in the cell fell below the pressure in the water dispenser, which ultimately controlled the pressure of the entire cell.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">(i) Using magnetic fields to modulate gas bubble release and transport (‘Magnetohydrodynamics’).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The following sections review each of these approaches.</p>
      
        <h3 id="sect759"><span class="b_heading">Hydrophobic islands</span></h3>
        <span>As noted above, the first stage of forming gas bubbles involves supersaturating the liquid electrolyte to levels that induce bubble nucleation on local surfaces, such as the electrode surface. However, if alternative local surfaces with a lower surface energy are available – for example, strongly hydrophobic surfaces like those of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) – then the bubbles should preferentially form on them and not on the electrode surface. A lower supersaturation may then be required for bubble-generation. The bubbles that form may, further, mask the hydrophobic surface, not the catalytically active electrode surface, which will be left in full and normal contact with the liquid electrolyte. This should lower the overpotential of gas production provided that the bubbles on the hydrophobic surface do not interfere with the catalysis at the electrode surfaces.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">This was the premise behind several reports in 1984–1991 that described coating Ni or Pt electrodes with a multiplicity of tiny islands of PTFE, producing a ‘hydrophobic mosaic’ on the surfaces of the electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit59"><sup><span class="sup_ref">59,60</span></sup></a> When the resulting electrodes were used to generate hydrogen, a notable decline in overpotential was observed. This was ascribed to the hydrophobic islands acting as collectors (‘scavengers’) of dissolved gas that then formed bubbles on the islands rather than on the surrounding catalytic surfaces. That is, gas bubbles formed and released preferentially on the PTFE surfaces, leaving the catalytic electrode surface uncovered or only partially covered with bubbles.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Teschke and Galembeck studied the effect in some detail and found that the relative coverage of the islands played a critical role in the extent of the overpotential decline, particularly at high current densities.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60a"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60a</span></sup></a> In 5 N KOH, the largest effect was observed with a 20% net coverage of PTFE, which required ∼1.58 V (<span class="italic">vs.</span> Hg/HgO) to produce hydrogen at the rate of 1000 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Without the PTFE islands, the same electrode required ∼1.73 V to produce 1000 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, putting the decline in overpotential created by the hydrophobic islands at ∼0.15 V.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">At a fixed potential of 1.58 V (<span class="italic">vs.</span> Hg/HgO), the current density of the electrode increased from ∼50 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (uncovered) to ∼1000 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (20% covered with PTFE islands), a ∼20-fold amplification. Thus, the uncovered 80% of the electrode surface must have exhibited a drastically increased catalytic activity that more than compensated for the 20% loss of electrochemically active area.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Teschke and colleagues later also studied columnar PTFE islands deposited using an etching technique on a Ni substrate.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60b"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60b</span></sup></a> Significant declines in overpotential were again observed at 1000 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In another set of experiments, Heidrich and Muller deposited a pattern of PTFE islands on a platinized Pt electrode. However, they observed a smaller, 5- to 10-fold increase in current density at constant potentials in 0.5 M H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> At 100 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, smaller overpotential declines of ∼0.028 V were also observed at 60 °C.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Later, in 1991, Lasia and co-workers, contested all of the above results and conclusions, claiming, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies, that they were fully explicable by changes in the roughness of the electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Possibly because of the disputes and inconsistencies, further work on this concept appeared to, effectively, halt. However, in 2011 Brussieux and colleagues re-investigated this effect using high resolution photography to determine precisely where the gas bubbles were and were not formed. They deposited various patterns of PTFE islands on Ni and Cu electrodes using photolithography and found that the gas bubbles did, indeed, mainly form on the PTFE islands and not on the surrounding electrode surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The pattern and diameter of the islands was critical to the size of the bubbles produced and their rate of release (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8</a>). Where the PTFE islands were sufficiently isolated from one another, bubble coalescence was prevented and the dispersity of the evolved gas bubbles was constrained by the perimeter size of each island. Larger islands (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 5.5 mm diameter) produced large bubbles in their center and smaller bubbles around the perimeter. The remainder of the uncovered Ni was, generally, not covered by a bubble or froth curtain. The photolithographic approach to deposition of PTFE allowed for considerable fine control over the size and spacing of islets, and also allowed for structured gradations in island dimensions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> The authors did not investigate the effect of the hydrophobic islands on the overpotentials or current densities of the electrodes.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Eikerling and colleagues also examined the diffusion of dissolved gas to such preferential bubble nucleation sites across sharp concentration gradients induced by nearby bubble growth. They pointed out that the deliberate introduction of preferential nucleation sites to the exterior of a porous electrode should have a beneficial effect on electrode stability, because the formation of bubbles inside a porous electrode can exert damaging mechanical stress on the structure.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">These reports explained some of the observations of the earlier, 1984–1991 work. The PTFE was clearly demonstrated to scavenge dissolved gas away from electrocatalytic sites, thereby avoiding bubble coverage on the catalytically active surfaces and improving their activity. The outsized effects produced by low overall surface coverages (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 20%) were explained as a compromise needed to balance the gas scavenging and ‘bubble collecting’ effects of the PTFE islands with the need to minimize the loss of active surface area by covering it with PTFE.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60a"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60a</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The apparent electrochemical activity at the interfaces between the deposited PTFE and the Ni electrode is particularly interesting. This effect was cited to be potentially important for the microscopic mechanical integrity of the electrode; Teschke indicated that an overcoating of Ni was needed to stabilize these edges.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60a"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60a</span></sup></a> Moreover, bubble nucleation at these edges was speculated to facilitate bubble generation and subsequent flow to the immediately adjacent, attached PTFE regions, where coalescence occurred, leading to larger bubbles. Such processes are described and favoured by the Marangoni effect, which involves mass transfer along an interface between two fluids due to a gradient of surface tension.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60a"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60a</span></sup></a> These lessons may plausibly be transferable to other electrodes which incorporate metal/PTFE interfaces, as will be discussed in the next section.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Given the amplifications in current density at constant voltage reported using the above techniques, it seems that they may provide an opportunity to significantly improve the energy efficiency of water electrolysers. We further note that, despite the apparent possibilities of this approach, there have been only very few studies referring to these effects, and no studies at all involving oxygen generation, which is, by far, the more energy-intensive process in water electrolysis.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Whilst the photolithographic approach used by Brussieux and co-workers provided for precise control over the size and position of the deposited islands,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> it is likely impractical for large-scale use. However, other, more easily scaled approaches, such as spray-coating, can potentially be used. Moreover, another way to achieve this effect is to increase the surface roughness and/or the hydrophobic topography of a catalyst layer, so that the surface structure and texture becomes more complex. This changes the surface energy, producing regions that are locally more hydrophobic.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a> Bubble coalescence, translation and release may be improved in these regions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a></p>

        <span>‘Breathable’ electrode concepts involve engineering electrodes that utilize capillary effects to avoid bubble formation on or in their active catalyst surface. Such electrodes typically possess a porous, aerophilic substrate that offers an alternative route for evolved gases to be removed from an electrocatalytic layer, whilst being impermeable to the electrolyte. That is, the build-up of a dense bubble curtain on the surface of the electrode is avoided by using a porous electrode, through which the gas may pass to thereby eliminate bubbles from the inter-electrode space.</span>

          <p class="otherpara">(2) Separators like Nafion 115 or Zirfon PERL typically degrade irreversibly at 100–110 °C, thereby restricting electrolyser operation to lower temperatures. Elimination of the need for a separator lifts this limitation, potentially allowing for operation at much higher temperatures. The PTFE in Gortex is, for example, indefinitely stable at 250 °C.

          <p class="otherpara">The first formation of gas bubbles on an electrode surface in a conventional, bubbled alkaline electrolyser, which causes a bubble curtain to cover the electrode, occurs immediately above the ‘diffusion limited’ current – <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the maximum current at which all of the formed gases can diffuse away from the electrode.

          <p class="otherpara">It appeared unlikely that the bubble curtain had been entirely eliminated as the onset potential of the best-performing bubble-free electrolyser did not decline to its minimum theoretical potential, corrected for electrolyte, catalyst and electrical conductivity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Bubbles that were invisible to the naked eye must presumably still have been present, either on or in the catalyst layer of the electrode.

Above this limit, bubbles started forming on or in the catalyst layer. However, if the current was then again decreased to below the limit, then all of those bubbles were quickly extracted and removed, rendering the electrode ‘bubble-free’ once again. That is, bubbles formed inside the catalyst layer at a current density above the bubble-free limit did not persist, but were rapidly removed once the conditions for bubble-free operation were re-established. The application of an overpressure on the liquid electrolyte relative to the gas chamber, expanded the range of current densities at which the electrode was bubble-free.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As to the question of how newly-formed gases were transported within the thick catalyst layer to the gas-extracting ePTFE layer of Gortex during bubble-free operation, two options existed.

Studies indicated that the latter was the correct explanation. Flooding of the PTFE interlayer with electrolyte was found to entirely halt all gas extraction by the Gortex membrane. This could not have occurred if the gas was migrating within the body of the polymeric PTFE structures present since the flooding did not interrupt the physical contacts between these structures in the electrode. By contrast, flooding with electrolyte would interrupt the migration of gas along contacting PTFE surfaces exposed to that electrolyte.</p>

Thus, as noted, since H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> froths would not be produced, there was no need to deal with them using gas–liquid separation systems or expansion volumes. In being capable of operating at 100% energy efficiency, there was potentially also no need for a cooling system, which would considerably reduce energy losses and economic costs. In so doing, the major elements of the balance of plant would, effectively, be reduced to a control system, a power supply, a deionized water supply, and gas handling infrastructure.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The cell also had disadvantages. The main one was the non-conductive nature of the Gortex gas diffusion layers, which forced the electrical connection between the bipolar electrodes in the stack to go around the Gortex in a “side-connection”. This created a more resistive pathway between the bipolar electrodes than is common in conventional cells (including those that connect directly through a conductive gas diffusion layer). While probably not a major constraint at low current densities, this arrangement would limit the energy efficiency with which larger current densities could be applied.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another disadvantage was the presence of common electrolyte manifolds, which may facilitate shunt currents between the cells. This could, however, be avoided by altering the design to provide make-up water within each individual cell, thereby eliminating the need for circulating electrolyte and the common manifolds (as discussed earlier in, for example, the Shimko or Seymour designs).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53,55–58</span></sup></a></p>

        <span>Another concept that has been explored has involved modifying the surface morphology of gas-evolving electrodes to encourage the production of smaller, non-coalescing gas bubbles that release rapidly. One way this may be achieved involves creating protrusive spicules on the electrode surface, which minimise the contact area of nucleating bubbles, encouraging their detachment by buoyant forces.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> Such protrusions could be said to be ‘gas-rejecting’ structures, especially if they are hydrophilic or superhydrophilic, and the electrodes can be said to be ‘superwetting’.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> Such nanostructured, aerophobic features therefore improve gas generating performance by enlarging the bubble contact angle and reducing the bubble adhesion force.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> But they also provide other benefits, including higher active surface areas, higher porosity, and enhanced electron transport, all of which may further amplify catalytic performance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">A large number of studies have demonstrated such effects and the field has been reviewed in some detail.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79,80</span></sup></a> For this reason, a detailed exposition of the work undertaken is not provided here, except to discuss a selected example that illuminates some of the practical considerations that may arise with the application of this approach to the electrodes in a water electrolyser.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Thus, fabrication techniques that impart high regularity and ideal feature structure, leading to optimum catalytic performance, may not be easily and practically applied to the electrodes used in electrolysers. On the other hand, less precise fabrication techniques, such as solution or electrochemical techniques, may not afford the ideal structures that are likely to be needed to fully exploit this effect. The best option may therefore be to combine different techniques in electrode fabrication. For example, a large configuration space of topographically and topologically distinct surface morphologies appears to be accessible <span class="italic">via</span> SNL,<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> through alterations in the SNL<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> procedure.

        <p class="otherpara">Finally, a potentially important and severe disadvantage of superwetting electrodes should be noted. While regular, repeated nanostructure of this type may accelerate bubble detachment and minimise bubble size, it also has the potential to create long-lived, sub-micrometer bubbles, called ‘nanobubbles’. Nanobubbles may remain on, and block surfaces for long periods of time. Until quite recently, such bubbles were not considered to exist based on predictions by Epstein–Plesset theory,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit83"><sup><span class="sup_ref">83,84</span></sup></a> which indicated that they would have to contain within them, unfeasibly high Laplace pressures. However, anomalous long-range (≥100 nm) attractions between hydrophobic mica sheets that have long puzzled theoreticians were recently successfully explained by the bridging of sessile nanobubbles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> Moreover, persistent surface nanobubbles on various substrates (hydrophobised Si, highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG), glass) were also directly imaged by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86–88</span></sup></a> So, surface nanobubbles are now an accepted phenomenon.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">They are believed to arise from a combination of gas supersaturation and contact line pinning due to ‘sufficient [geometric or chemical] surface heterogeneity’.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89,90</span></sup></a> Nanobubbles are characterized by extraordinary stability (with lifetimes up to many days)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> and extremely low buoyancy (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 100 nm diameter bubbles take over two weeks to rise 1 cm),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> meaning that they may remain on the electrode surface and reduce its effective electrochemical surface area for an extended period of time. Ostwald ripening processes of surface nanobubbles have been modelled in detail and indicate that nanobubbles with sufficiently small separations will coalesce into larger bubbles as may be intuitively anticipated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> However, nanostructured surfaces which interfere with bubble coalescence without encouraging detachment (contrary to the example provided by Brinkert above)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> are likely to yield unsatisfactory performance.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">These results explain experimental observations that nanometer-scale surface protrusions encourage nanobubble formation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> The lattice density functional theory (LDFT) results of Liu, <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit90"><sup><span class="sup_ref">90</span></sup></a> are of particular note in this respect because they illustrate the use of a ring-shaped chemical or topographic feature to effect the contact line pinning and stabilisation of a nanobubble.

        <h3 id="sect1176"><span class="b_heading">Sonication</span></h3>
        <span>Sonication is the process of applying sound energy to a sample. This may involve audible sound waves within the range of human hearing, or ‘ultrasound’, which involves sound waves with frequencies beyond the upper audible limit of human hearing (≥20 kHz). Sonication has been successfully used to amplify the rates of bubble generation in water electrolysers, and thereby also their current densities. However, there are caveats to the use of sonication in electrolysis due to the high associated energy densities.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Sonication of a liquid creates a rich variety of acoustophoretic effects that are of potential relevance to gas evolving electrodes. The two main effects are: ‘rectified diffusion’ and ‘acoustic microstreaming’.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In a liquid, the phenomenon of rectified diffusion involves acoustically stimulating the isotropic expansion and contraction of a bubble in such a way that gas diffuses into the bubble preferentially (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> a form of imperfect ‘gas diode’).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> In effect, the liquid is compressed and decompressed rapidly, causing micro-voids to repeatedly form and then collapse within it. This happens only when the acoustic pressure exceeds a certain threshold (≥10 kPa).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> In water, the power required to achieve such an acoustic pressure is much lower than that required in air.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The net effect of creating and then collapsing voids in this way, is reported to improve the performance of a gas evolving electrode by increasing both the bubble growth rate (and therefore bubble detachment frequency and bubble buoyancy) as well as the clearance of dissolved gases from the vicinity of the electrode. In essence, instead of relying on a high level of gas supersaturation in the liquid electrolyte to create gas bubbles, rectified diffusion cyclically creates bubble-like voids into which dissolved gas may migrate at a lower supersaturation. In this way, gas ‘bubbles’ are produced without the additional voltage needed for high level supersaturation (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the bubble overpotential<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> is largely avoided). Moreover, such ‘assisted’ bubble formation need not occur only in the cracks, clefts and defects on the electrode surface itself (heterogeneous bubble formation), as is normally the case. Instead, it can occur in open solutions, away from the electrode surface, so that the ‘bubbles’ thus formed, are already detached (homogeneous bubble formation). The constant back and forth movement induced by sonication and the possibility of gas migrating from one void to the next, further assists in the movement of the gas away from the electrode. That is, the bubble curtain, or, actually, the bubble froth in this case, is highly dynamic; it doesn't block access to the electrode in the same way that a bubble curtain may and it provides a thoroughly mixed two-phase gas/liquid mixture through which newly-formed gases may readily migrate.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Acoustic microstreaming is a fluid motion associated with an acoustically driven bubble. Gas flow simply arises from the fact that bubbles/dissolved gases are entrained in the microstreaming fluid. With small bubbles, these flows derive from radial and translational modes of bubble oscillation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> However, in bubbles larger than approximately 1 mm, surface modes, known as Faraday waves, become dominant and accessible to excitation at quite low acoustic pressures (30–50 Pa) and frequencies 1–10 kHz.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> A complete theory of acoustic microstreaming has been constructed by the successive contributions of many researchers over approximately half a century.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a></p>

Organic molecules are generally more readily oxidisable than water or hydroxide, so that increases in current density upon the addition of a surfactant may potentially reflect the addition of a parallel surfactant oxidation process. Some surfactants may potentially also be reduced at the cathode but this is less of a concern. To be sure that such competing processes do not take place to any significant extent, studies should ideally confirm that the surfactants are oxidized or reduced outside of the water-splitting window, or that the faradic efficiency of oxygen and hydrogen production does not change when the surfactant is used. In cases where control experiments of this type are absent, claims regarding surfactant effects should be treated with appropriate caution.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">Electrode performance was, however, diminished by the use of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Statistical analysis of bubble size, contact angle, and adsorption tension indicated a considerable reduction in the median bubble size and adhesive force for both surfactants,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> suggesting that a complex interplay of physico-chemical factors may have influenced the performance of such surfactant-mediated electrodes. The enhancement of electrode activity may potentially have been due to: (i) a decrease in the specific surface energy associated with bubble formation and growth,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> (ii) a modification of the catalyst surface by adsorbed surfactants leading to enhanced wettability (and therefore increased ‘aerophobicity’),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> or a combination of both of those factors.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Direct electrochemical effects may conceivably also have a bearing on the relative activity of surfactant-modified electrodes.

        <p class="otherpara">It should also be noted that the use of surfactants may significantly complicate gas–liquid separation. That is, in modifying the hydrophobicity/aerophilicity of the electrode surface and decreasing the electrolyte surface tension, the use of surfactants may also encourage the formation of highly persistent liquid–gas froths. Such froths may be harder to separate into bulk liquid and gas phases in the tank separators presently used in electrolysers. This may necessitate larger separators and/or more extensive scrubbers to ensure that the produced gas is scrupulously free of electrolyte. The capital and operating costs of such modifications may offset the benefits of using surfactants. The formation of surfactant micelles around gas bubbles (generating so-called ‘coated bubbles’) is routinely used to suppress coalescence and encourage monodispersity in the microbubbles used for contrast enhancement in medical ultrasound.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> There is no reason to believe that the presence of surfactants would not have similar effects in electrolysis.</p>
      
      
        <h3 id="sect1393"><span class="b_heading">Electrolyser centrifugation (supergravity)</span></h3>
        <span>Electrolyser performance in the microgravity of outer space is well-known to be very poor due to the rapid formation of a persistent bubble curtain, also termed a ‘froth layer’,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> on the electrodes and the near-absence of electrolyte convection around the electrode.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119,120</span></sup></a> Thus, in the gravity of Earth, there must be a strong dependence on bubble buoyancy and associated agitation for electrolytic performance. It is this dependence that substantially diminishes the performance of water electrolysers in low- or microgravity environments, such as may be expected in free-fall, lunar (<span class="italic">ḡ</span> = 1.6 m s<small><sup>−2</sup></small>),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> or Martian (<span class="italic">ḡ</span> = 3.7 m s<small><sup>−2</sup></small>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> contexts.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In the microgravity limit, bubble curtain formation is incessant and increases in void fraction to the point that the electrolysis is almost but not completely halted; various microconvection mechanisms ensure that it is not completely suppressed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a> This has implications for water electrolysis in regenerative fuel cell/oxygen production contexts, as pointed out by Matsushima and co-workers,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119,120</span></sup></a> who also studied modifications of the wettability of the electrode surface as a means of mitigating the issue.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> These studies involved terrestrial (1<span class="italic">G</span>) and microgravity (free-fall) environments, the latter of which were realised by dropping the test electrolysers down drop shafts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> A special electrochemical control system was devised for these experiments.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">At present, the only functional water electrolyser in orbit is the Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) of the International Space Station (ISS). This device employs a pump to continuously sweep the bubble froth off the electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125,126</span></sup></a> The froth is pumped into a Rotary Separator Accumulator, where the hydrogen is separated from the liquid electrolyte by centrifugation; that is, the froth is centrifuged to separate the produced hydrogen.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125,126</span></sup></a> The separated liquid electrolyte is then returned to the electrolyser. The hydrogen can either be vented into space or used in a Sabatier reactor where it reacts with exhaled carbon dioxide to produce water, thus closing the loop with regard to oxygen and water, with the produced methane vented to space.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">While this is the procedure used in the ISS OGA, two other modes of sustained, high-volume electrolytic water splitting in space that could have been used are:</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(1) Centrifugal electrolysis, in which the electrolyser itself is spun in a centrifuge to create an artificial gravity that separates the hydrogen during operation; or</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(2) Electrolysis utilizing breathable electrodes, which rely on gas capillary effects that are unaffected by gravity, or its absence, to extract gas as it is formed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The use of breathable electrodes was discussed in an earlier section. It offers an intriguing approach to microgravity electrolysis. Bubble-free electrolysis entirely avoids the issues of bubble froth formation under microgravity since the gases are continuously and directly extracted from the catalyst layer as they are formed. There would therefore be no need to continuously remove the froth from the electrode surfaces or then have to separate it into bulk liquid and gas phases. A microgravity electrolyser based on the principles of breathing electrodes can be conceived of as a monolithic unit, with a substantial reduction in moving parts. Nevertheless, the complexities of engineering potentially life-critical systems for space applications are both sobering and outside of the scope of this work.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The other alternative, namely, a centrifugal electrolyser, has also been studied and, in fact, demonstrated to increase the efficiency of water electrolysis.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8,127</span></sup></a> When employed on Earth, such an electrolyser mimics the effect of an increased gravitational field on bubble adhesion.

At a relative acceleration rate of 190 G at 80 °C, large reductions in cell voltages of up to 0.700 V were observed at a fixed current density of 300 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, relative to the stationery state. Anode and cathode potential declines of up to 0.500 V and 0.350 V respectively, were reported. The improved energy efficiency more than offset the much smaller energy required to rotate the cells. Most of the improvement in energy efficiency was found to come from accelerated mass transport, which led to bubbles being quickly removed from the electrode surfaces, thereby minimizing ohmic resistance. The authors concluded that centrifugation with a high acceleration field, had significant potential in commercial water electrolysis, where it should lead to higher system efficiencies.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Wang and colleagues carried out a similar study in 2010.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> In their work, they measured the voltage and overpotential declines under galvanostatic conditions as a function of the applied gravity coefficient (<span class="italic">G</span>) and the current density.

As can be seen, a truly dramatic decrease in the froth volume with increased effective gravitational field was evident. The authors reported that water electrolysis was notably amplified under centrifugation, with large declines in cell voltage relative to the stationery state, especially under high effective gravitational fields and at high current densities.</p>

      <h2 id="sect1518"><span class="a_heading">Conclusions</span></h2>
      <span>In this work we have reviewed and examined the different ways in which the deleterious direct and indirect effects of bubble formation and release in water electrolysis could be eliminated or mitigated. Approaches to address the indirect effects have involved engineering and design innovations to simplify and streamline the balance of plant. The direct effects have been tackled with more fundamental strategies, including the use of: (1) hydrophobic islands to direct bubble formation to particular locations, (2) gas capillary effects to directly extract and collect gas as it is created, before bubbles form, (3) superwetting surfaces to assist and control bubble release, (4) surfactants to promote bubble formation and release, (5) sonication as a means of accelerating bubble detachment and mass transport, (6) a supergravity field to maintain the electrodes and inter-electrode space free of bubbles, (7) electrolyte convection over the electrodes to remove bubbles as soon as they are formed, (8) continuous pressure swings, and (9) magnetic fields.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Of the latter techniques, approaches (1)–(3) above appear (subjectively to the authors at least) to be both the least explored and the most promising. The application of hydrophobic/hydrophilic and capillary effects that either eliminate the deleterious effects of gas bubbles, or eliminate the gas bubbles themselves, in water-splitting electrodes, should be studied further. The fundamental nature of these effects should be elucidated in full detail.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">These approaches should be combined however, with a judicious appreciation of the need for design and engineering measures that simplify the entire system, including the balance of plant. For too long, researchers have focussed only on optimising the electrodes in electrolysers without consideration of the full system. It is now clear that electrode optimisation only makes sense if it also makes it possible to maximally shrink and simplify the balance of plant and the system as a whole.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">It seems to the authors, that until means are developed to effectively and properly minimise the effects of bubble formation in electrolysers, both direct and indirect, a true hydrogen economy that effectively competes with fossil fuels will remain elusive.</p>

      <li><span id="cit103">If 60 Hz was used, then this suggests that large-scale excitation of the electrolyte and/or electrodes may have been responsible for the process enhancement, rather than direct excitation of bubbles. It may further be speculated that the walls or electrodes of similar reactors could function Chladni plates at higher frequencies (2 kHz, although the fundamental frequency depends on a large number of material and geometric parameters). This would encourage migration of bubbles and their coalescence along nodal arcs. Along these lines, we note a publication which demonstrates impressive acoustophoretic control over the position and coalescence of supported liquid droplets, as well as the manipulation of other small objects on thin silicon Chladni plates (50 × 50 × 0.5mm) oscillated at frequencies from 1.0 to 29.8 kHz; see:   Q.
