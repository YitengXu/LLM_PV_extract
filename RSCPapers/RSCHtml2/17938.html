Again, the writing team has remained unchanged this year. Solid sampling techniques are still proving extremely popular for the industrial type samples because many of them are hard to dissolve/digest. As well as perennial favourites such as the X-ray techniques that, in general, are regarded as being non-sample destructive, laser ablation and glow discharge, which cause minimal sample loss, are also gaining ground. The use of LIBS is growing rapidly and it is appearing in application sectors where it had not previously. There has been a large increase of interest in the biomedical subject areas. Proteomics has had several applications featured, as has the detection of several drug/drug metabolites. Similarly, the interaction of drugs with compounds that are present naturally has also been studied. Even biocompatible ceramics for use in orthopaedic applications have been studied in this review period. The nuclear section is still dominated by the determination of depleted uranium. This topic looks as if it could run for a few years yet. As always, the glass section is split largely between archaeological determinations and forensic applications, although some new XRF instrumentation was also reported. In the semiconductor and conducting materials section, there has been an increase in the development and characterisation of solar cells.</span></p></div><hr/><h2 id="sect316"><span class="a_heading">1 Metals</span></h2><h3 id="sect319"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Ferrous metals and alloys</span></h3><span>In general, work on solid sample analysis continues to be the focus of research and in particular <span class="italic">laser induced breakdown spectrometry</span>

However, other complementary techniques were required in most cases for a complete analysis.

A new method for making samples with particle inclusions has been developed. Calibration between the analytical signal for the inclusion type and inclusion particle size has been achieved. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and single-particle optical sensing methods (SPOS) have been used to verify the LA-ICP-MS results. Good agreement was reported between LA-ICP-MS and SEM for particles 10–40 μm in diameter but for the 2–20 μm range only reasonable agreement between LA-ICP-MS and both SPOS and SEM was reported. The same LA-ICP-MS technique was used by the same authors to determine the composition and particle size distribution of inclusions in a nickel alloy with 10% Fe.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> These were compared with particle analysis by SEM with electron probe micro-analysis (EMPA). Good agreement was found for particle sizes &gt;1 μm. Particle distribution under 1 μm was underestimated due to the limit of measuring small particles on polished surfaces by LA-ICP-MS. It was claimed that LA-ICP-MS was superior to SEM with EPMA for measuring complex non-uniform inclusions. Coustures and colleagues used LA-ICP-MS to determine inclusions trapped in iron archeological material which was compared with trace element analysis of ore bodies and artifacts at known ancient ore processing sites in order to establish the origin of iron tools at other archaeological sites.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a></p><p class="otherpara">Houk <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> mixed particles from LA and desolvated particles from a Teflon microconcentric nebulizer into an ICP simultaneously with detection by a magnetic sector mass spectrometer. Calibration was attained by comparing the analyte signals from the solution with those from the solid sample. Signal normalization was based on the weight of particles, measured by piezoelectric microbalance, transported from the ablation cell. The authors claimed matrix matched solid standards and prior knowledge of the sample were not required for calibration. The relative accuracy of trace element determination was found to be 3–12% using both a steel and a glass reference material, for all analytes measured except Bi and Pb.</p><p class="otherpara">Lu and co-workers reported the use of briquetted samples with a protective layer of borax to analyse powdered metallurgical slags by XRF<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> along with the application of a “pseudo-Voight” curve fitting-function to resolve overlapping peaks.

These two classes were broken down further, with S compounds being classified as thiol, sulfides and disulfides, thiophenes, benzothiophenes or dibenzothiophenes. The jet fuels tested in this study appeared to contain S mainly as thiols or sulfides and disulfides, as determined by gas chromotography-atomic emission detection (GC-AED), following the chemical oxidation procedures.

The samples were spiked with mercury-201 and wet ashed in a closed system (Carius tube) using 6 g of high purity nitric acid.

A range of elements were identified in the whole cigarette smoke, including major analytes, such as Na, and trace elements, such as As, Cd and Hg. The major portions of most of these elements were found to be present in the particulate phase, whereas the greatest level of Hg was detected in the gas phase. The elements As, Br, Cd, Cl, I and Sb were distributed between both phases. The measurement precision was element dependent and ranged from 5 to 25% RSD, based on either peak height or peak area measurements.</p><p class="otherpara">As mentioned at the start of this section of the review, the number of <span class="italic">speciation applications</span> has grown again this year. The trend in this analysis area in recent years has been towards more routine application of speciation measurements (for both oxidation state speciation and organic molecule speciation), and considerable work has been done to achieve this goal. ICP-MS is a powerful detector for speciation analysis, and this was reflected in the growing numbers of LC/CE/GC-ICP-MS papers appearing in the literature.

Since no standardised procedures are at present available to verify that vehicles leaving the production line are in accordance with this directive, the objective of this work was to develop analytical procedures for total Cr and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> determination in these materials. Initially, the sample digestion procedures were optimised for total chromium determination in plastic and metallic materials.

After optimisation and validation with the only currently available solid reference material certified for its Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> content (BCR 545, Welding Dust), the efficiency of this extraction procedure for screw coatings was compared with that described in the EN ISO 3613 standard usually used in routine laboratories. For coatings comprising zinc and aluminium passivated with chromium oxides, the extraction procedure developed in this work was more efficient than the standard method. This was also observed for the screw sample covered with a chromium passivant layer on zinc–nickel. However, for the coating comprising a chromium passivant layer on alkaline zinc, the standard extraction procedure was more efficient.

In this work, diamonds originating from four different mines were studied. Each diamond was ablated on 8 different spots for 30 s and the median of the eight integrated signals was taken as a representative value for subsequent statistical analysis. Under these conditions, the total mass of material removed from a single diamond was around 16 μg. Finally, 9 elements were selected for fingerprinting purposes (Al, Hg, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Ti and Zn) and different pattern recognition techniques were applied to classify the data.

MC-ICP-MS permits highly precise measurement of isotope compositions for a wide range of elements combined with good detection limits due to its high sensitivity. The technique is usually applied to continuously introduced samples, but in the present study it was applied for isotope ratio determination on transient signals generated by a HPLC coupled to the MC-ICP-MS instrument. In order to investigate the origin of ratio drifts across the transient signals for this hyphenated technique, measurements with the same solutions were also carried out using a flow-injection device for sample introduction. The results demonstrated that the main source of bias in the measured isotope ratios lay within the ICP-MS rather than in fractionation effects on the HPLC column. Preliminary studies on short transient signals of gaseous samples (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, dry plasma conditions) showed a reverse fractionation effect compared with flow injection and HPLC generated transient signals (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, wet plasma conditions).</p><p class="otherpara">In another transient signal application for MC-ICP-MS, capillary gas chromatography was coupled with the MC-ICP-MS instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a> The instrumentation was used to assess precision and instrumental mass bias in S isotope ratio determination for the gaseous S species SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>.

It has been used, in the form of negative ion TIMS, to effect a 10-fold improvement in the precision of B isotopic analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> Boron isotopes are potentially very important to cosmochemistry, geochemistry and paleoceanography: however, measuring their ratio has been limited by the large sample amount required for positive TIMS (PTIMS), and the high mass fractionation for negative ion TIMS (NTIMS). When measuring B as BO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small>, NTIMS was a highly sensitive technique, requiring only nanogram sized samples, but it had rather poor precision (typically 0.7 to 2.0 parts per thousand) as a result of the large mass fractionation encountered with this relatively light ion. In contrast, measuring B as the much heavier molecule, CS<small><sub>2</sub></small>BO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>, PTIMS usually achieves better precision (around 0.1–0.4 parts per thousand). Furthermore, there was a consistent 10 parts per thousand offset in the <small><sup>11</sup></small>B/<small><sup>10</sup></small>B ratio for the NIST SRM 951 standard boric acid between NTIMS data and the certified value, although the cause of this offset was unknown. In this work, the authors adapted an earlier technique to improve the NTIMS technique for BO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small>. They were reportedly able to correct for instrumental fractionation by measuring BO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> species at masses 42, 43 and also at 45, which enabled normalization of the 45/43 BO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> ratio to an empirical <small><sup>18</sup></small>O/<small><sup>16</sup></small>O value.

In addition, the authors also concluded that the Mn was leached from the surface inwards towards the centre. The determination of Pd in a number of materials including a polymer, a pharmaceutical drug and a used auto-catalyst reference material, by solid sampling GFAAS, has been described by Resano <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">158</span></sup></a> The influence of parameters such as the temperature programme, the use of a matrix modifier, the analytical wavelength employed and sample mass were all investigated.

Overall, the authors concluded that direct analysis of the solid materials prevented the need for lengthy or hazardous dissolutions whilst enabling a reasonable precision to be obtained (between 3 and 15% RSD). In addition, with an analysis time of 15 min per sample, there was a high throughput and the LOD of 0.4 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the drug indicated good sensitivity. By far the largest volume of work performed by analysing solid materials has employed various X-ray techniques. The degradation rates for poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and for nitrocellulose with cellulose acetate in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159</span></sup></a> Previous studies had demonstrated very differing results for degradation rate, especially when using different pieces of instrumentation. The present work indicated that the variation could arise through both the difference of layer thickness used for the measurement and the differing levels of adventitious electrons in the different instruments. The study led to the formulation of simple operating recommendations for this type of analysis. The surfaces of two pure polyolefins, low density polyethylene and biaxially oriented polypropylene, were modified by vacuum UV light in the presence of low pressure ammonia and the resulting surfaces analysed by an assortment of techniques including XPS, TOF-SIMS and total reflectance IR.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit160"><sup><span class="sup_ref">160</span></sup></a> It was shown that up to 25% N could be chemically bonded to the surface, predominantly as an amine group.

A summary of the relative merits and drawbacks of the technique was also presented. Another review of TOF-SIMS has been prepared by Belu <span class="italic">et al.</span>, who discussed its use for the analysis of biomaterials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> Since the surface of these materials plays such a critical role in the success of a surgical implant, the surface chemistry must be characterised very accurately. The technique of TOF-SIMS was ideal for this purpose, because it has the ability to determine the composition, structure, orientation and spatial distribution of the molecules and chemical structures at the surface. The review introduces the first principles of the technique and then moves on to discussing its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the sample considerations that must be taken into account. Finally, the authors provide an outlook for the use of TOF-SIMS for biomaterials analysis. Two applications of TOF-SIMS have been published in this review area. One described the preparation and subsequent analysis of polyaniline emeraldine base (PANI EB) films doped with selenium.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> The thin films were obtained by spin coating of silicon and zinc selenide substrates with PANI EB and Se solution in DMSO. The Se distribution was studied using TOF-SIMS. Many semiconductor devices were encapsulated in epoxy moulding compounds. Often, these compounds contain halide ions (either Br as a flame retardant or Cl from epichlorohydrin used in the epoxidation) which, when in the presence of water, can break down the protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium metallized components and accelerate corrosion. Since the rate of corrosion will depend on the rate of ion diffusion, Lantz and Pecht used TOF-SIMS to measure ion diffusion in the epoxy moulding compounds.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> It was found that the rate of diffusion depends on the type of moulding compound, on the pH and on the concentration of ions present. The mode of diffusion was through the polymer resin matrix rather than diffusion at the interface of the resin and filler particles.</p><p class="otherpara">Several applications of the analysis of polymers or the leaching of analytes from polymers have been published. The systematic errors in the determination of trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb) by GFAAS have been discussed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a> The behaviour of these analytes (at pH 2) on contact with borosilicate glass and polyethylene containers and then transferred to polyethylene–polypropylene and home-made quartz autosampler cups was studied.

The most significant losses of Cr and Ni occurred on a polyethylene surface, whilst the highest absorbance signals were obtained from quartz containers. Other analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Cd and Cu, also yielded higher absorbances when kept in quartz containers. Conversely, for Pb, the quartz container yielded the lowest absorbance reading. The container material had no effect for either Co or Mn. A method of pressurized wet digestion in open vessels has been reported by Maichin <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> A high pressure asher was adapted with a Teflon liner. The autoclave was partly filled with water containing 5% hydrogen peroxide. The digestion vessels (quartz or PFA-Teflon) were either dipped partly into the water or arranged on top of it by means of a titanium or PTFE coated stainless steel rack, and then the asher closed and pressurized with nitrogen to a pressure of 100 bar. The digestion vessels tested varied in volume between 1.5 mL and 50 mL. Sample size and volume of digesting solution varied depending on the size of the vessel, but for the smallest vessels, 50 mg of sample was digested with 0.2 mL of nitric acid + 0.5 mL water + 0.2 mL of hydrogen peroxide. The time required for digestion was 90–120 min, depending on the sample type. Nine CRMs were digested using this apparatus, and the digests analysed by GFAAS. No cross contamination between samples was observed and the data obtained for As, Hg and Se agreed well with the certified values, indicating that losses of these volatile analytes were minimal. The procedure was applied to the digestion of a number of sample types including cocoa, walnuts, pumpkin oil, lubrication oil, straw, polyethylene and coal. An interesting application has been reported by Liou, who used a range of analytical techniques (SEM, XRD, FT-IR and ICP-MS) to investigate the kinetics of the pyrolysis of electronic packaging material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a> Using temperature ramps of 5, 10, 15 or 20 K min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and under an inert nitrogen atmosphere, the effect of the heating programme on the surface area and pore structure of the samples was discussed. In addition, kinetic parameters such as the activation energy, pre-exponential factor and reaction order were determined. The author concluded that the results would be useful in developing pyrolysis or incineration systems for plastic waste from electronic components. Two similar papers that used TOF-SIMS have been published by Skrzydlewska and Balcerzak. In one, toxic elements in laminated plastic food packaging materials were determined after high pressure microwave digestion in a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> Materials analysed included low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene, and a mix of terephthalate–polyethylene.

In the other paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> multi-elemental analysis of non-food packaging materials was reported. Both LDPE and high density polyethylene (HDPE), as well as a mix of polyethylene–polypropylene (PE–PP), were analysed. Again, digestion was achieved using the high pressure microwave digestion apparatus, but on this occasion the acid mixture was either nitric–hydrogen peroxide (for the LDPE and PE–PP mix) or nitric, sulfuric and hydrogen peroxide (for the HDPE). The authors used TOF-SIMS as the means of analysis and utilised the internal standards Y and Rh. A total of 13 analytes were determined.

Limiting oxygen index (LOI) is one of the most commonly used parameters to indicate the flammability of textiles and other polymeric materials. This study investigated the correlation between LOI and P/N content of the fabric. For the measurements, ICP-OES was used for P and IR was used for the N.

Liu and co-workers have pointed out that high resolution depth-profiling (of 1 nm) is critical in the semiconductor industry today.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> In addition to good resolution, it is necessary to have well characterised reference materials so that accurate quantitative analysis of doping profiles can be obtained. The International Standards Organization (ISO)/Technique Commission (TC201)/Surface Chemical Analysis (SC6-SIMS) have been engaged in the development of the international standardization of depth-profiling of dopants in silicon using SIMS. The paper by Liu <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> reported the use of the low energy primary ion O-2(+) in the SIMS depth-profiling of BN delta-doped silicon samples grown by magnetron sputtering. Surface roughening complicated the measurement so, in an attempt to minimise this, the effects of oxygen flooding and sample rotation were studied. There are numerous methods that may be used to achieve depth-profiling, and they fall into two broad camps. Either a layer is removed and this is then analysed (as is the case with SIMS, GDMS, GDOES, ablation based techniques, <span class="italic">etc</span>.), or the layer that remains after another layer has been removed is analysed <span class="italic">in situ</span>
					(<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Auger electron spectroscopy or XPS). Assuming there is no preferential sputtering of a component, the techniques are complementary and should yield the same result. A paper by Hofmann discussed the concepts and present state of depth-profiling.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit212"><sup><span class="sup_ref">212</span></sup></a> This author stated that the ion–solid interaction was fundamental to the understanding of depth-profiling and discussed how a greater understanding has yielded great improvements in experimental profiling experiments. The development of mathematical models has also facilitated deconvolution of the measured profile. A comparison of different methods for the precise measurement of Ge depth-profiles in silicon–germanium hetero-bipolar transistors has been made by Zaumseil and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> X-ray diffractometry and reflectometry, spectroscopic ellipsometry, Auger electron spectroscopy, SIMS and TEM were all used during the comparison. It was shown that the values obtained agreed very well within the error limits and that an achievable accuracy of layer thickness of about 1 nm can be achieved routinely. The highest accuracy for determining the Ge content was obtained using either XRD or well calibrated spectroscopic ellipsometry.</p><p class="otherpara">A femtosecond LA-TOF-MS technique has been applied to in-depth multi-layer analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> The samples analysed were a silicon wafer, which had been implanted with 10<small><sup>17</sup></small> ions cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> of Co that had previously been characterised using other established techniques, and a thin film metal standard (NIST 2135c), which was a silicon wafer with nine alternating layers of Cr and Ni, each having a thickness of 56 and 57 nm, respectively. Using a resolution of 300, the orthogonal TOF-MS instrument was capable of achieving adequate sensitivity. The results obtained were very encouraging, with the technique being capable of resolving the depth profiles of these samples. However, the precision was poor and this was attributed to pulse to pulse stability of the laser system used. Despite this, the authors concluded that the technique showed a great deal of promise.</p><p class="otherpara">The technique most commonly used for depth-profiling/diffusion studies has been SIMS. Strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) was introduced to amorphous silica as a ferroelectric material for non-volatile memories.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit215"><sup><span class="sup_ref">215</span></sup></a> Diffusion of Bi, Sr or Ta from an SBT layer into a thin layer of silica was promoted by annealing at 800 °C for time periods in the range 1–24 h. The diffusion profiles of the analytes were then determined using SIMS and, in an attempt to elucidate the diffusion mechanism, the results were compared with profiles derived from theoretical calculations. Although SIMS cannot determine the analytes’ binding situation, it can be used in conjunction with theoretical calculations to obtain indirect information, which led the authors to conclude that Bi and Sr reacted with vacancies in the silica.

Mills and co-workers reported the preparation of a novel, highly stable amorphous silicon hydride.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit220"><sup><span class="sup_ref">220</span></sup></a> The product was formed by using a microwave plasma reaction of silane, hydrogen and helium, where a positively charged helium ion acted as a catalyst.

The authors theorised that the highly stable silicon hydride coating may advance the production of integrated circuits and micro-devices by resisting the oxygen passivation of the surface and possibly altering the dielectric constant and band gap to increase the device performance. The majority of applications in this part of the review concern the characterisation/properties of copper gallium selenide (CGS) or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin films. Nishiwaki <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the preparation of Ga rich CGS films prepared on molybdenum/soda lime substrates by the bilayer process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit221"><sup><span class="sup_ref">221</span></sup></a> The film surfaces were then modified by chemical bath treatment with indium sulfate, thioacetamide and triethanolamine to improve the performance in solar cell applications. The film compositions were characterised using XRF and XPS. The chemical bath treatment led to an improvement in the spectral response, especially at the long wavelength part of the spectrum, which resulted in an increase in a short circuit current density and an increase in the parallel and series resistance of the cells. Herz <span class="italic">et al</span>. reported the deposition of CIGS thin films on 1–3 μm layers of alumina, deposited as diffusion barriers by rf sputtering from a ceramic target, on metal foils.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit222"><sup><span class="sup_ref">222</span></sup></a> A CIGS solar cell of 0.25 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> achieved an efficiency of approximately 10–11% without sodium doping. In the absence of the alumina barriers, the efficiency was substantially lower, except for when the films were deposited on titanium foils. This was attributed to a reduction in fill factors and to reduced open-circuit voltages. Using SIMS and sputtered neutral mass spectrometry depth-profiling, the different cell efficiencies were correlated with the amount of impurities entering the CIGS layer by diffusion from the substrates. The presence of the diffusion barriers decreased the amount of Fe and Cr diffusing from the chromium steel foils, the amount of Ti diffusing from the titanium foil and the amount of Co, Fe, Ni and Ti diffusing from the Kovar® foils.

The authors concluded that the technique was fast, it did not require sample handling or preparation and it was free from charge effects that affect the ion beam techniques.

Ion beam analysis (PIXE and PIGME) has been used by Biron and Beauchoux for the analysis of 20 Mosan enamels dating from the late 12th and early 13th centuries.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239</span></sup></a> The ion beam techniques were used to determine the composition of both the glass and the metal phases of the enamel plaques, and the results wee compared with those obtained previously by the British Museum and the authors’ own laboratory. It was found that all of the 12th century coloured glasses (except the red ones) were soda-lime silicates with mineral sodium sources that were opacified with antimony compounds. The red glasses were potash-lime silicates with wood-ash potassium sources. The 13th century glasses were soda-lime silicates using plant ash sodium sources and tin oxide-based opacifiers. The authors therefore managed to hypothesise a chronological evolution for the glass composition.</p><p class="otherpara">Much interest in the <span class="italic">forensic applications</span> of glass analysis has also been demonstrated. Two papers published by Trejos and Almirall have used LA-ICP-MS to characterise glasses.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240,241</span></sup></a> In the first, LA-ICP-MS was used to study fractionation, since this poses one of the major challenges to using this technique for characterising glass. Two different approaches were taken to evaluate the fractionation: (i) fractionation index and (ii) the measurement of the U to Th ratio. It was found that most of the fractionation indexes were low (between 0.8 and 1.2) for the majority of the analytes. The U ∶ Th ratio seemed to indicate that fractionation was higher at the beginning of the ablation process. To evaluate whether or not fractionation could affect the quantification of glass samples by LA-ICP-MS, a comparison was made between this technique and conventional solution-based determination. In addition, the distribution of particle size during the ablation under different laser systems and conditions was also measured to see the effects on fractionation. Standard reference materials (NIST 610, 612 and 1831) were analysed in triplicate, along with 10 casework samples originating from different automobiles. In the second of the papers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241</span></sup></a> the results from LA-ICP-MS using a Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm with an output power of 6 mJ were compared with those obtained from solution nebulisation. A total of 91 different glasses were determined (45 headlamp glasses spanning 20 years and 46 automotive glasses that included side windows, rear windows and windshields). A suite of analytes were determined, with some (Ba, Hf, Mg, Pb, Sb, Sr and Zr) being determined by isotope dilution. Analysis of NIST 612 indicated that the bias was less than 5%, whilst precision was generally better than 10% RSD. The authors stated that whilst solution nebulisation utilising external calibration and isotope dilution presented excellent sensitivity and precision, it also suffered the disadvantages that complex dissolution procedures were required and the sample was effectively destroyed. The LA-ICP-MS method, however, was described as being simpler, faster and was capable of providing an excellent alternative to solution analysis of glass for forensic purposes.

Similarly, it was also possible to distinguish between pottery made in the same kiln but at different times and also between different grades of pottery. The mineralogical characteristics of the raw materials used by two workshops to prepare Roman pottery from North West Greece has been used in an attempt to elucidate the ceramic manufacturing technologies employed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit285"><sup><span class="sup_ref">285</span></sup></a> The techniques employed in the study were optical microscopy, XRD, SEM and ICP-OES. From the results, the authors were able to deduce that both workshops used oxidising conditions within the kilns and that the firing temperatures were between 850 and 1050 °C. Padeletti and Fermo used ICP-OES, XRD, GFAAS and SEM to analyse both the ceramic bodies and the lustred surfaces of Italian Renaissance imitations of Hispano-Moresque style ceramics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit286"><sup><span class="sup_ref">286</span></sup></a> The presence of cosalite (Pb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Bi<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>5</sub></small>) in the Italian lustre decorations and its absence in the Hispano-Moresque ones was the factor that enabled distinction between the two.</p><h3 id="sect1367"><span class="b_heading">3.5 Catalysts</span></h3><span>As always, there has been considerable interest in the design, characterisation and use of different catalysts. By far the most common catalyst type reported in this review period has been those that have been immobilised onto <span class="italic">zeolites</span>. These catalysts have many and varied uses. The most common of the zeolite-based catalysts was ZSM-5/HZSM-5. Adebajo and co-workers reported the XRD, XRF, ICP-OES, FT-IR and NMR characterisation of catalysts that were active for the oxidative methylation of benzene with methane.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit287"><sup><span class="sup_ref">287</span></sup></a> Both ZSM-5 and H-beta catalysts were tested. Results from XRD indicated that the crystalline structures of both catalyst types remained unchanged after batch reaction of benzene with methane, which was in agreement with the finding that the catalysts could be recovered and then re-used without loss of activity. Elemental and FT-IR analyses indicated that as the level of metal ion exchange increases, the Brønsted acid concentration decreases (but was never totally removed). In addition, FT-IR also demonstrated that only a small number of ion exchange sites were necessary for the catalyst to be active, because used catalysts with very low Brønsted acidity could be re-used without a decrease in activity. The post-steam treatment of a Mo-immobilised HZSM-5 catalyst increased its activity for methane dehydroaromatization under non-oxidative conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit288"><sup><span class="sup_ref">288,289</span></sup></a> The process, which enhanced the stability of the catalyst, gave a higher methane conversion as well as a higher yield of light aromatics. It also decreased the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Overall, it was described as being facile and effective. The properties of the catalyst before and after post-steam treatment were compared using techniques such as <small><sup>27</sup></small>Al, <small><sup>29</sup></small>Si and <small><sup>1</sup></small>H multinuclear magic angle NMR, XPS, XRF and TGA measurements. It was found that after the post-steam treatment the free Brønsted acid sites decreased and that there was more Mo migration into the HZSM-5 zeolite channels. In addition, the pore size was found to be larger, which aided the mass transport of the reaction products, but a severe treatment (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, with a treating time longer than 30 min) could lead to the formation of Al-2(MoO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small> phases, which were detrimental to the reaction. Treating of nano-scale HZSM-5 with steam containing 0.8% by weight ammonia at 773 K, followed by loading with lanthanum oxide and nickel oxide, yielded catalysts that were active for the reduction of olefins in fluidized catalytic cracking gasoline.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit290"><sup><span class="sup_ref">290</span></sup></a> The parent and derivatized molecules were characterised by several techniques including TEM, XRD, IR and XRF. The stability of the catalysts was found to be satisfactory in all cases, but the initial activity decreased slightly after the combined modification. In addition, the modified catalyst had a reduced ability for aromatization and an increased ability for isomerization. After 300 h on-stream, the average olefin content of the gasoline was reduced from 56.3% to 20%; whilst the C7–C9 aromatics and paraffins contents increased from 11.6% and 32.1% to 20% and 60%, respectively. Morales <span class="italic">et al</span>. studied the reaction of acetone transformation over mono-metallic (Pt/H{Al}ZSM-5, Sn/H{Al}ZSM-5) and bimetallic PtSn/H{Al}ZSM-5) catalysts that had differing atomic fractions of tin.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit291"><sup><span class="sup_ref">291</span></sup></a> The solid catalysts produced were characterised by XRD, EDXRF, XPS, ICP-OES and EPR. A sensitive variation in the catalytic properties was observed as X–Sn was varied in the series PtSn/H{Al}ZSM-5; where X–Sn = number of Sn moles/number of Sn moles + number of Pt mole. These changes were attributed to the presence of effects of the electronic and geometric type, which were a consequence of the formation of a Pt–Sn alloy and probably the phenomenon of decoration of Pt particles. Pergher and co-workers described the preparation of Pd/NaY-zeolite and Pd-W/NaY-zeolite catalysts that were active for the decomposition of NO to N<small><sub>2</sub></small> and N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, through ion exchange and impregnation methods of the compounds Pd(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small> and W(CO)<small><sub>6</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit292"><sup><span class="sup_ref">292</span></sup></a> In the latter case, photochemical activation of the W(CO)<small><sub>6</sub></small> enabled the formation of the Pd–W derivative. Numerous methods were used to characterise the catalysts formed, including AAS. The conversion of NO and the selectivity to N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O was studied as a function of time and reduction temperature. It was found that both catalyst types exhibited an initial period of high and constant activity followed by deactivation. At 573 K the deactivation was more pronounced in the W containing analogue: however at 973 K the presence of W allowed the catalyst to have a higher conversion for a longer period of time. The authors concluded that the presence of W prevented the sintering of small Pd particles.</span><p class="otherpara">Another common catalyst support used in this review period has been <span class="italic">MCM-41</span>. An example includes dicyano-functionalized palladium complexes that could be used as recoverable heterogeneous catalysts for the Heck reaction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit293"><sup><span class="sup_ref">293</span></sup></a> The catalysts were easily separated after use and were re-usable. A modified impregnation method was used during the formation of the base catalyst Ba<small><sub>2</sub></small>SiO<small><sub>4</sub></small> on the MCM-41 pore wall.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit294"><sup><span class="sup_ref">294</span></sup></a> Techniques including XPS, XRD, XRF, <small><sup>29</sup></small>Si MAS NMR and nitrogen adsorption were used to characterise the product and the authors demonstrated that a high Ba loading of between 4.1 and 25.2% was achieved. The basicity of the catalysts was found to increase with increasing Ba loading. Chen and Ko used direct hydrothermal and impregnation methods to prepare vanadium containing catalysts (V-MCM-41 and V/MCM-41, respectively).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit295"><sup><span class="sup_ref">295</span></sup></a> Again, characterisation was achieved using ICP-OES, XRD, <small><sup>29</sup></small>Si and <small><sup>51</sup></small>V NMR, nitrogen adsorption and oxygen chemisorption. The catalysts were used for the oxidation reaction of diphenylmethane with <span class="italic">tert</span>-butyl hydroperoxide to produce benzophenone. De Clercq <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the preparation of two solid catalysts in which a Schiff base containing ruthenium was covalently anchored onto MCM-41.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit296"><sup><span class="sup_ref">296</span></sup></a> The catalysts were characterised using XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, FT-Raman, solid state NMR and BET techniques. The catalysts were multi-functional and the authors described how they could be used in ring closing metathesis (RCM), ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), Kharasch addition, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and vinylation reactions. The authors undertook a lengthy study of the reaction characteristics of their catalysts and found the effects of reaction time and temperature on the RCM reaction and that the ATPR process of styrene proceeds in a controlled fashion and yields well-defined polymers. In addition, the Kharasch activity was found to have a pronounced temperature dependence. The authors postulated a mechanism that could explain the observed selectivities in the vinylation experiments. Copper derivatized MCM-41 and beta zeolites that could be used for isomerization of 1-butene were synthesised and characterised using XRD, nitrogen adsorption, XRF, FT-IR and DCP-AES.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297</span></sup></a> The presence of Cu in the hydrogenated MCM-41 increased the activity compared with the untreated support, but the presence of Cu in the beta zeolite did not alter the catalytic activity. Using FT-IR and quantum chemical calculations, the authors attributed these phenomena to the presence of Cu<small><sup>+</sup></small> in the H-MCM-41, which was formed during the catalytic pathway from Cu<small><sup>2+</sup></small> to Cu metal, whereas the reduction was more rapid in the beta zeolite where the presence of Cu<small><sup>0</sup></small> predominated. Bernas and co-workers compared numerous heterogeneous catalysts for the isomerization of linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) at temperatures of between 80 and 120 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> The metals Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh or Ru as well as the bimetallic Pt–Rh were supported on activated carbon, alumina, silica/alumina, MCM-22, H-MCM-41 and other zeolite supports. The catalysts produced were characterised using the techniques of nitrogen adsorption, XRF, XRD, DCP-AES and XPS. It was found that two competing reactions were taking place. As well as an isomerization reaction, a hydrogenation reaction transformed the linoleic acid and CLA to mono-unsaturated octadecenoic acids, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, oleic acid, elaidic acid and <span class="italic">cis</span>- and <span class="italic">trans</span>-vaccenic acids. Further hydrogenation to stearic acid was also possible. It was found that the presence of Ni and Ru showed the best isomerization properties, but that the Pd analogue favoured the hydrogenation reaction.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Composite catalysts</span> have also been studied at length in this review period. Some of these applications have already been discussed in the polymers section.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit198"><sup><span class="sup_ref">198,199</span></sup></a> Another example has been reported by Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span> who functionalized macroporous titania materials with Keggin-type polyoxometalates using both the sol–gel and template methodologies.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> The products were evaluated for their photocatalytic activity for the degradation of the dyes rhodamine B, methyl orange and erythrosine BS. Among the numerous methods used to characterise the products were ICP-OES. The composite materials were shown to have greater activity than either pure titania or the polyoxometalates and this was attributed to the synergistic effect of the two together.</p><p class="otherpara">Several other types of catalyst have been developed and characterised in this review period. Zhou and co-workers described the preparation of a lead–zinc double oxide heterogeneous catalyst that was capable of catalysing the synthesis of diphenyl carbonate <span class="italic">via</span> a <span class="italic">trans</span>-esterification reaction between dimethyl carbonate and phenol.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a> The authors determined the effect of preparation method, calcination temperature, precursor and molar ratio of Pb/Zn on the catalytic activity. The catalysts were characterised using several different techniques including AAS. Overall, the authors concluded that the main active species was Pb<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> and that ZnO played the role of a promoter. A calcination temperature of 500 °C and a Pb/Zn ratio of 2 ∶ 1 produced the catalysts with the highest activity; providing a yield of 45.6% diphenyl carbonate. Catalyst deactivation was caused by decreasing amounts of Pb<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>. A paper by Kladis <span class="italic">et al</span>. described the preparation and subsequent characterisation using nitrogen sorption, FT-IR, ICP-OES, XPS and XRD, of novel Co, Cu and Zn exchanged chabazite SAPO-18 solid acid catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit301"><sup><span class="sup_ref">301</span></sup></a> Once the catalysts had been characterised, FT-IR was used to determine their mechanism of reaction during the adsorption and disproportionation of nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide.

However, several important issues, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, the stability of the metal–oxide interface at working temperatures and pressures were not well understood.

					(or non-recovery of the catalyst) was another extensively studied area. These studies tend to be relatively straightforward applications, but many were of interest anyway. The Schiff base 1,2-bis(salicylideneamino)phenylene cobalt(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) was chemically bound to a carbamate modified silica gel using a four step procedure.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit309"><sup><span class="sup_ref">309</span></sup></a> Once formed, the catalyst was found to be very active for the oxidation of cyclohexane at relatively mild conditions (150–200 °C and at 15–20 atm). The product was selective for the production of cyclohexanol, with this being produced in preference to cyclohexanone by a ratio of 45 ∶ 1. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the catalyst was stable up to 211 °C and AAS indicated that there was negligible loss over 50 h of use. Leaching of anchored Pd and Rh species from thiourea functionalized monolithic xerogel catalysts has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit310"><sup><span class="sup_ref">310</span></sup></a> The metals leached from the catalysts, which were useful for the hydroformylation (in the case of Rh) or hydrogenation (Pd) of styrene, were determined by ICP-OES.

The former had an efficiency of 87% and the latter 99.6%. Using ICP-OES, no leaching of Ru or Ti could be observed down to the LODs of 0.2 and 0.1 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. Two papers have discussed the leaching of catalysts through membranes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312,313</span></sup></a> In the former paper, a porous inorganic membrane reactor was presented for homogeneous catalysis in supercritical carbon dioxide with <span class="italic">in situ</span> catalyst separation. The authors demonstrated the use of a fluorinated Wilkinson style catalyst for the hydrogenation of 1-butene. Since the particle size of the catalyst was in the range 2–4 nm it was much larger than the pore size of the membrane (0.5–0.8 nm) and so did not pass through. Butane could be produced continually at a temperature of 353 K and at a pressure of 20 MPa. Both UV-Vis and ICP-OES indicated that no detectable amount of P or Rh was present at the permeate side of the membrane. In the latter paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit313"><sup><span class="sup_ref">313</span></sup></a> 4-methylstyrene was polymerized and then brominated before being reacted to form an air-stable phosphonium salt. When Pd was incorporated into the polymer, an efficient catalyst for carbon–carbon coupling reactions of the Sonogashira, Suzuki and Heck types was formed. The catalytic performance was not affected by the molecular weight over the range 5–35 kDa. If a membrane composed of a dense poly(dimethylsiloxane) layer cast on a porous sub-layer of poly(acrylonitrile) was prepared, then this formed a barrier that was virtually impervious to the catalyst. Retention of the catalyst, measured by TXRF determination of Pd, was found to be better than 99.5%. The catalyst could then be re-used without loss of activity for up to nine cycles of the Sonogashira and Suzuki reactions, although the polar aprotic solvents used in the Heck reaction rapidly degraded the membrane.</p><p class="otherpara">Finally, Jones and co-workers reported the sulfur poisoning and subsequent regeneration of catalysts consisting of precious metal supported on alumina during methane combustion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit314"><sup><span class="sup_ref">314</span></sup></a> The effects of compounds such as ethyl mercaptan, methyl mercaptan, carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide in the feed gas were determined by comparison with feed gases that did not contain them. Although all the catalysts studied were poisoned to some extent, Pt–alumina and Rh–alumina were poisoned more strongly than was Pd–alumina. Analysis of the exhaust gases using GC-AED and FT-IR analysis of the spent Rh–alumina catalyst indicated that sulfation of the support occurs and that a mixture of reduced and oxidised species were produced. Regeneration using hydrogen at 400 °C was partially successful, with Rh–alumina regenerating well, but Pt–alumina being particularly poorly regenerated.</p><span id="sect1462"><h2 id="sect1461"><span class="a_heading">4 References</span></h2></span><ol type="1"><li><span id="cit1">I.
