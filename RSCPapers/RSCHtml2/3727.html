        <span class="bold">Moritz F. Kuehnel</span> opened a discussion of the paper by Andrew I. Cooper: What do you know about the HOMO and LUMO localisation on the polymers? I suppose this is strongly affected by introducing heteroatoms such as sulfur, and that this causes the changes observed when oxidising the thiophene to sulfolane moieties. Can you use different heteroatoms to tweak the redox potentials?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> answered: Yes – by changing the heteroatom one can change the catalytic activity, but this can also change a variety of other things such as the surface hydrophilicity and (in some cases) the polymer molecular weight, or, in the case of networks, the surface area. As such, it is often unclear whether these effects come from changes to the redox potentials or a variety of factors.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Moritz F. Kuehnel</span> asked: How much is known about the residual palladium in the polymer? What do you know about its environment, which I assume will depend on functional groups in the polymer backbone, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> donor groups? I am wondering if the observed differences in activity for different polymers are a result of the different palladium environments, rather than other, more easily determined factors. such as the band gap, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Do you have any EXAFS data?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> responded: No, no EXAFS data as yet, but the palladium metal can vary in size from a few nanometers (or even palladium clusters) up to 50 nm or so. Ian McCulloch, James R. Durrant and coworkers have shown in ref. 1 that palladium can be catalytically active in such materials at very low concentrations. In their studies, very low palladium concentrations (&lt;40 ppm) have an effect on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Virgil Andrei</span> enquired: The polymers employ residual palladium from the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling as the hydrogen evolution co-catalyst. Have you considered using molecular catalysts to expand the scope of the photocatalysis towards CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction? The polymers possess aromatic units; therefore, molecular catalysts may be easily attached to the polymeric backbone <span class="italic">via</span> π–π stacking interactions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> responded: Yes, we are working on this – for example, by introducing bipyridyl metal binding sites into the polymers.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">James R. Durrant</span> commented: I am intrigued that the most active polymer you show appears to be very hydrophobic. For proton reduction photocatalysis I would have expected that some degree of polymer hydrophilicity would be preferred. Could you comment on this?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> responded: Hydrophilicity is an important variable, but it is one such factor – the hydrogen evolution rate is also affected by the band gap, the energy levels, particle size, surface area, and the level of precious metals in the material, which act as co-catalysts. A big difficulty in designing these materials is that no single variable dominates the catalytic activity (see for example: ref. 1).</p>

        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> remarked: I am curious as to whether secondary/tertiary structures (similar to biopolymers) have been investigated and what their role might be in controlling reactivity?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> responded: No, only in the context of crystalline COFs and amorphous analogues, where strong differences in catalytic activity are observed, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> as in ref. 1. It is hard to control secondary/tertiary structure in these rigid polymers.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael Grätzel</span> commented: I assume that a sacrificial donor was used in the light driven hydrogen evolution process. Could Professor Cooper please provide the chemical structure of the donor? I wonder whether the hydrogen produced under light arises from the reduction of water or from the sacrificial donor. Could Professor Cooper also show the action spectrum for the hydrogen generation to see whether it matches the absorption spectrum of the ladder polymer acting as a sensitizer?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> responded: Yes, we used triethylamine or triethanolamine generally, or in some cases ascorbic acid, but we have also tested non-hydrogen containing donors, such as Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>S, to exclude the possibility of the hydrogen coming from the donor.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ravi Shankar</span> opened a discussion of the paper by Martijn A. Zwijnenburg: The screening method that you have applied for polymeric photocatalysts is very interesting. Is there scope to apply or expand this screening method towards other types of catalysts, such as porous catalysts?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> responded: Our approach is specific for photocatalysts but other groups are working on similar approaches for other material classes, including porous materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Burkhard König</span> commented: Conjugated polymers show a specific conjugation length. How many repeating units do you have to consider in your evaluation of polymer photocatalyst properties to describe them well by computational methods?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> answered: Yes, indeed. In our experience oligomeric models with a length of twelve units, as used in this work, provide approximately converged properties with respect to oligomer length.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> asked: What metrics are the computational results determined by? What makes a good catalyst? If you (and Professor Cooper) do not know what is bad then how do you know that you are not missing something?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> answered: We know that a good photocatalyst should at least absorb visible light and have sufficient driving force for all desired solution reactions, proton or CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction and water or sacrificial electron donor oxidation. What we know less about is what other factors are (the most) important (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> wettability, reaction kinetics, and charge–carrier and exciton transport), what the best (computational) descriptors for these additional factors are, and the nature of the interplay and trade-offs between the different properties. However, ignoring what we do not fully understand, this still means that by predicting the optical gap and potentials of materials we can rule out many of them by computational screening and only concentrate on the more promising remaining ones experimentally. To paraphrase Frank Westheimer: A couple of months in the laboratory can frequently save a couple of hours of computer time. Another use of (computational) screening in my opinion is to gain an understanding of how photocatalyst properties are interconnected by generating data sets that are large enough to extract inter-property correlations.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wolfgang Domcke</span> said: The exciton binding energy can be quite large in these polymeric materials and therefore it is an important parameter. Will you come up with specific numbers in the future?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> responded: While we have not done so here, the exciton binding energy could in principle be approximated from the difference in the fundamental gap, itself defined as the difference between a polymer's ionisation potential and electron affinity, and its optical gap. In previous work (ref. 1) we approximated the exciton binding energy for an exciton in the polymer bulk and near the polymer–water interface using DFT and found values of 1200 and 170 meV, respectively. The fact that even the latter value is much larger than the kT at room temperature (26 meV) suggests that excitons in the polymer photocatalyst likely dissociate on the polymer–water interface or polymer–polymer interface in the case of a heterojunction, with the electron and hole after dissociation ending up in different phases.</p>

        <span class="bold">Marcelino Maneiro</span> opened a discussion of the paper by Ferdi Karadas: I think that cyclic voltammetry would shed more light on the characterization of your system, and even on its catalytic mechanism. Have you tried to perform cyclic voltammetry on your Ru–P4VP–CoFe dyad? In relation to the catalytic activity, do you have any evidence that water is oxidized at the cobalt sites?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> replied: I agree that cyclic voltammetric studies would definitely help to characterize the assembly in more detail. Such measurements, however, were not performed mainly because the assembly does not dissolve in water and coating this polymeric assembly on an FTO electrode <span class="italic">via</span> conventional methods was not successful.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The identity of the catalytic site was not investigated in this study. The origin of the catalytic site has been investigated previously and it is well-established in Prussian blue systems that hexacyanometal sites are not catalytically active sites and that it should be the cobalt sites that are coordinated to at least one water molecule. Please check our recent papers (ref. 1 and 2).</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthias Beller</span> enquired: Following on from the previous question, how sure are you about the stability of this system? Did you compare it with other systems?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> replied: The ruthenium chromophore is connected to the Prussian blue (PB)-type water oxidation catalyst in our study. We also performed photocatalytic studies with a regular PB system in the presence of a ruthenium chromophore, which is not connected to PB. Previous studies in the literature as well as our photocatalytic studies and post-catalytic characterization measurements suggest that the connected assembly exhibits a much higher stability.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael Grätzel</span> asked: Professor Karadas stated that his Co(CN)<small><sub>6</sub></small> Prussian blue-type catalyst remained intact during his reaction as a catalyst for the oxidation of water to oxygen. However it appears unlikely that this is the case for the catalyst molecules exposed to water that are actively involved in the oxygen evolution reaction. Rather, they are expected to be converted to cobalt oxides which in turn will catalyze the water oxidation reaction.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> answered: Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are non-oxide based coordination networks, which make them way more stable than molecular catalysts. It should also be noted that the solubility product of PBAs is much lower than those of oxides due to the highly sigma-donating nature of the cyanide ligand, which leads to the formation of a strong M–CN–M’ coordination mode. Furthermore, our XPS studies did not reveal any possible formation of oxides. The stability of PBAs have been studied comprehensively in ref. 1 and 2 as well.</p>

        <span class="bold">Catherine M. Aitchison</span> queried: What do you think is the rate-limiting step in the system and have you tried to optimise the ratio of the components (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> sensitizer to polymer to catalyst)? Do you think this would also be important for stability given that you mention that a possible deactivation pathway of the catalyst is poisoning by photosensitizer ligands?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> replied: We have not performed any experiments to investigate the rate-limiting step. It could, however, be speculated that the rate-determining step could be the activation of the catalytic cobalt sites given its high overpotential. Within the project, two different assemblies with different stoichiometric ratios of Ru<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>Fe have been prepared. Since their performances are comparable only one of them was reported, so our preliminary studies do not indicate any correlation between the ratio of the components and the stability or performance of the catalyst.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew B. Bocarsly</span> asked: Following up on Michael Grätzel’s question, how certain are you that the outer surface of the material is the catalysis site? Cyanide bridged cyanometalate complexes are known to form microporous structures. Thus, your substrate can penetrate into the interior of the cyanometalate layer. Furthermore, these materials tend to be rather defective with open coordination sites, thus interior catalytic sites may be available. Your materials may have some similarity to the [Ru(bpz)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small>/cyanometalate layered structure discussed in ref. 1.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> answered: Thanks for sharing this paper. We are certain that cobalt sites that are coordinated to at least one water molecule should be catalytically active sites and we have previously shown in ref. 1 that this type of active cobalt site can be increased by incorporating polymers to this chemistry. The polymeric moiety probably increases the number of defective cobalt sites, as suggested, by decreasing the dimensionality of the Prussian blue structure. These defective sites are also known to occur in the interior of the network. We have also performed porosity studies on these polymer–PB hybrid structures (which is not reported in this manuscript), which show that their microporous behavior disappears since the polymeric groups probably block the microchannels. So even if there is a considerable number of active cobalt sites in the bulk of the material, these are not accessible. Overall, polymeric groups decrease the dimensionality of the PB structures at the expense of blocking the microchannels.</p>

        <span class="bold">Reiner Sebastian Sprick</span> addressed all of the presenters: When using organic polymers as photocatalysts stability is a concern, particularly when performing water oxidation. Would you be able to comment on this and have you performed experiments to explore this?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> responded: The stability of polymer photocatalysts when using a sacrificial electron donor (SED) does not seem to be an issue (see ref. 1), however this might be different when oxidising water rather than a SED, especially if the former has sluggish kinetics. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis comes from work in the literature on a polymer consisting of triazine units linked by disulfide bridges (see ref. 2). This material is reported to stably evolve hydrogen in the presence of a SED but to photocorrode when using pure water.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> answered: Our post-characterization studies mainly focused on the stability of the metal sites and whether they were transformed to any oxide under photocatalytic conditions. No special method has been performed to explore the stability of the polymer. The visual observation of the powder suspension, however, reveals that the suspension is colorless even after the photocatalytic experiment. This implies that none of the ruthenium fragment went into the solution. Therefore, even if the polymeric chain is broken during the photocatalysis, it was limited and did not lead to disconnection of the chromophore from the catalyst. The maintenance of the activity for six cycles also supports this hypothesis.</p>

        <span class="bold">Matthias Beller</span> followed this by asking: The sacrificial reductant plays a significant role. We get what we screen for – we screen for the best catalyst that works, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> triethanolamine, ammonium nitrate. How much can we learn from this for a real system? In the long term? Should we all focus on electrocatalytic reactions?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> replied: It is undoubtedly true that the use of sacrificial electron donors (SEDs) biases the results and that one in the long term runs the risk of optimising a photocatalyst for oxidising a SED instead of water. In the short term, however, I still see a good case for the use of SEDs in photocatalyst discovery. For example, one would not want to miss a potentially promising photocatalyst system for overall water splitting because in the absence of the ideal co-catalyst water oxidation is too sluggish for any activity to be observed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> answered: Since there are many possible systems to target and since the preparation and analysis of each of these systems is a tedious task, the use of a sacrificial agent is a practical solution for the sake of an efficient use of time. This solution, of course, comes with the expense of moving away from real condition analysis, which could give results beyond the ballpark or lead to wrong directions in certain cases. Thus, researchers should make their own risk analysis to choose the ideal conditions to test their systems.</p>

        <span class="bold">Christine A. Caputo</span> asked Martijn A. Zwijnenburg: There is a large molecular space to explore computationally. How many experimental validation points do you think you need to provide confidence that your approach is robust?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> responded: Good question. As, as it stands, we do not predict photocatalytic activity as such but rather the materials properties that underlie it, we typically benchmark our ability to predict those. In terms of the number of validation points, the more the better. This is simple for some properties, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the optical gap, as UV-Vis spectra are measured routinely, but harder for other properties, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the ionisation potential and electron affinity of polymers, the measurement of which requires very specialized equipment, and as a result values have only been reported for a very limited set of polymers in the literature.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dominik Wielend</span> said: You have mentioned at the end of your paper that one of your future goals is the prediction of intermolecular properties like charge transport, <span class="italic">etc.</span> My question is, if you could estimate trends (maybe just qualitatively), which polymer combinations might tend to form intermolecular interactions (either stacking, which might be influenced by a possible bent structure of the polymer, or interactions similar to hydrogen-bonded pigments)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> responded: Thanks, that is an interesting suggestion; something we cannot do as yet but might be worth looking into in the future. In general, <span class="italic">a priori</span> predicting how molecules pack in the solid state is a very difficult problem, especially for amorphous or poorly-crystalline materials, like most polymers. The extent to which a more approximate approach might work will probably be controlled by how strongly a given property depends on the exact details of the packing and/or how common a particular packing motif is.</p>

        <span class="bold">Martijn A.

        <span class="bold">Joost N. H. Reek</span> posed to Ferdi Karadas: In your approach you are using polymers to which the catalyst and the chromophores are attached in a random fashion. In nature all of the components required for efficient photosynthesis are highly organised and well positioned with respect to one another. Of course it is nice that you show that this random organisation does lead to photo driven water oxidation, but it is unclear what the efficiency is (maybe only a small fraction of the components is sufficiently organised to be active). Can you comment on the efficiency (do you know this?), and do you think we need to develop strategies that allow for better spatial control of the components, for example by using supramolecular assembly?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> replied: I agree that the organisation of the components in an assembly is of crucial importance for better charge separation and efficiency. Interrogation of the efficiency or methods for improving the efficiency, although important, is beyond the scope of this study. It should be noted that the main objective of this proof-of-concept study is only to show that photosensitizers can be connected to a water oxidation catalyst <span class="italic">via</span> cyanide chemistry and that the chromophore is more stable in such an assembly. Given the results, our recent efforts have now been dedicated to the addition of each of these chromophores <span class="italic">in situ</span> on a semi-conductor. As suggested, the use of supramolecular assemblies can also provide an alternative synthetic pathway towards this goal.</p>

        <span class="bold">Simon T. Clausing</span> addressed all of the presenters: Andrew and Martijn presented polymers that are designed to fulfil all roles for photocatalytic hydrogen generation at once: light-harvesting, electron relay, a hydrogen evolving catalyst, and interface to water. It has been noted by Andrew that if you change one parameter to make it more efficient, you "break" another. Would it therefore not be better to focus on developing polymers that can, for example, be wettable light-harvesters with good electron relay functionality, and supply an external catalyst? Or have a catalytically active polymer, but supply an external photosensitizer? Ferdi showed a system like that; is that not an approach that might lead to quicker results, as it is modular by design?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> responded: Yes, this is a very good idea in principle and recently we’ve been looking at more modular approaches. Putting the modules together again becomes complex, though...</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> replied: Indeed, using a composite rather than one polymeric material as photocatalyst is probably a promising strategy. One could actually argue that the commonly used polymers (inadvertently) loaded with metal nanoparticles are already examples of such composites, as well as the polymer–polymer and polymer–oxide heterojunctions reported in the literature. Moving from single materials to composites, however, could be a double-edged sword. The same complexity that makes it possible to independently optimise processes/properties will also make the workings of a composite photocatalyst more difficult to study and understand.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> added: As in natural photosynthesis, I believe that the preparation of a multifunctional assembly, wherein each component (chromophore, catalyst, donor, acceptor, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) is assigned for a special task, could be a viable approach for better efficiency. However, the field still needs new assemblies and proof-of-concept studies to explore its boundaries and establish its foundations. So even assemblies with lower efficiencies could help us learn more about this process.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ernest Pastor</span> addressed Martijn A. Zwijnenburg: Do you have any thoughts on the mechanistic role of the scavenger in these systems? For example in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction with molecular complexes it is proposed that the TEA or TEOA can participate in the mechanism at several points as you can form very reactive radicals. This could also affect the stability of the compounds.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> answered: My hypothesis is that, in the case of TEA, the mechanism involves outer-sphere electron transfer from TEA in the first step and its singly-oxidised deprotonated counterpart in the second step. The latter is indeed very reactive in the sense that it is strongly reductive (predicted potential &lt; −2.5 V <span class="italic">vs.</span> SHE at pH 11.5, the likely pH of a TEA solution, compared with +0.7 V for the first oxidation step and −0.7 V for the overall oxidation of TEA under the same conditions, see ref. 1 and 2). From a thermodynamic perspective this suggests that the first oxidation step will act as an effective kinetic barrier that needs to be overcome for overall oxidation of TEA to occur and that the second oxidation step is likely to be very fast. Beyond this we currently have very little mechanistic insight, something that hopefully will change in the near future.</p>

        <span class="bold">Erwin Reisner</span> addressed all of the speakers: Our community is still mostly optimising photocatalytic half-reactions using sacrificial electron donors and acceptors, which causes the problems just discussed and they also need to be ultimately removed to catalyse useful closed redox cycles. Also, single light absorber photocatalyst systems have lower theoretical solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies than dual light absorber systems and work by Domen, Kudo, Abe and others has previously shown that photocatalytic systems using semiconductor particle pairs can be constructed with suitable reversible redox shuttles. I would therefore like to hear your opinion on shifting the emphasis of our efforts to optimising our half-reactions using <span class="italic">reversible</span> redox shuttles rather than <span class="italic">irreversible</span> sacrificial donors. Optimising photocatalytic half-reactions with reversible donors is more challenging as it also introduces issues with back-reaction, but would in principle allow the coupling of individually optimised half-reactions <span class="italic">via</span> a reversible mediator to produce a functional closed redox system.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew I. Cooper</span> responded: I think this is absolutely the right way forward. As previously mentioned at the meeting, "you get what you screen for". I think there is an urgent need to move away from sacrificial reagents, unless (perhaps) these are coupled to biome schemes, waste degradation, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, and hence additively useful.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> replied: I agree, two materials coupled together in Z-scheme by a reversible redox mediator is a strategy worth pursuing. From a computational perspective, this is something we could readily screen for using the methodology described in our contribution. In the defence of sacrificial electron donors, use of them has allowed Prof. Cooper’s group and us to demonstrate that hydrogen evolution activity is quite a common property of conjugated polymers, something I suspect few people would have expected to be the case five years ago.</p>

The ligands of these complexes are engineered to conserve a nearly tetrahedral configuration upon oxidation to the corresponding Cu(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) complexes.

        <span class="bold">Martijn A. Zwijnenburg</span> added: Understanding the mechanism by which polymer photocatalysts can evolve hydrogen and/or oxygen is, in my opinion, the next big challenge in the field. Not much is known with certainty in this area. One can hypothesize that for polymers loaded with palladium and platinum nanoparticles, either added intentionally or as the remains of the catalysts used to synthesize the polymers, the mechanism involves electron transfer to these nanoparticles, which then reduces the protons and evolves the hydrogen. Indeed there is experimental evidence in ref. 1 that, at least for some polymer photocatalysts, removing any traces of palladium results in the disappearance of any hydrogen evolution activity. However, there also reports in the literature that appear to suggest that certain polymers might be able to evolve hydrogen in the absence of any noble metal.</p>

How can you explain this if there is no change in the molecular structure of the catalyst?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> replied: This can be explained by the exchange of chlorido ligands for solvent molecules. Fig. 6 of our paper (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c8fd00162f" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/c8fd00162f">10.1039/c8fd00162f</a>) shows that solvato complexes perform better than their chlorido analogues. This exchange is certainly dependent on the kind of metal used. In Fig. 4 the Pt and Co chlorido complexes show an induction period of 24 h, since this is the time needed for the production of the solvato complexes in these cases.</p>

        <span class="bold">Christine A. Caputo</span> remarked: In your study you extended the PNP ring size, and this had the effect of changing the coordination of the ligand on the metal centre, and ultimately fundamentally changed the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. Have you thought much about this change and how it impacts the results you observed?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: Our PNP ligands have been tailored to make different coordination properties possible. Thus for the PNP–C1 ligands coordination of the nitrogen atom is impossible. This makes it feasible for the function as proton relay. By contrast, the nitrogen atom in the PNP–C2 ligands leads to two fused five-membered rings upon coordination. At first glance this should inhibit the proton relay function. However, the catalytic performance of the PNP–C2 ligands is better than that of their PNP–C1 counterparts. DFT calculations show that a different mechanism is responsible for this amazing behaviour, which could be applicable also for other pincer-type ligands.</p>

        <span class="bold">Moritz F. Kuehnel</span> posed: In your long-term experiments you are continuously adding additional Ir photosensitiser. What are its decomposition products? When you did control experiments, you only used the Ir complex without an HER co-catalyst, and you nevertheless observed some H<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation. From my own experience, it is vital to consider that photosensitisers can form HER catalysts not only from their own decomposition products, but also with composition products of the HER catalyst. Have you performed control experiments in which you combined the Ir photosensitiser with <span class="italic">e.g.</span> only the ligand used for the HER co-catalyst?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: It is well known in our laboratory that the Ir photosensitiser alone produces a minor amount of hydrogen as indicated in the paper. For this kind of photosensitiser this is known in the literature. Ir nanoparticles are believed to be responsible for this effect (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> see M. Beller’s work on copper iodide using Ir photosensitisers in ref. 1). However, we have performed amalgam tests in order to study the influence of nanoparticles. Since there was no drop in activity, the observed HER is dominated by molecular species. We did not use Ir as the metal for our PNP catalysts. I agree that this is a good idea to check whether water reducing catalysts (WRC) based on Ir are active catalysts.</p>

Molly O’Hagan at Pacific Northwest National Lab showed by NMR studies that long alkyl chains on the amines in the P<small><sub>2</sub></small>N<small><sub>2</sub></small> type ligands caused them to move more slowly the bigger the R group (ref. 1).

        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> answered: I agree, this is certainly a so-called stereoelectronic effect as described by P.W.N.M. van Leeuwen. Different R groups change the basicity of the pendant amines and their accessibility for protons due to steric constraints. This has been confirmed by DFT calculations. Slower movement of the protons is of course also a disadvantage. Quite clearly, in our study there is a beneficial effect of small R groups. This important effect has been confirmed in the meantime by preliminary experiments, where R is now H.</p>

        <span class="bold">Michael Grätzel</span> opened a discussion of the paper by Sergii.

The latter in turn was used to oxidize water to oxygen using an Fe(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) complex as a molecular catalyst. I was wondering whether the time resolved laser photolysis experiments revealed any changes in the transient absorption that could be attributed to the conversion of the Fe(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) to the Fe(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) complex.</p>

        <span class="bold">Michael Grätzel</span> remarked: I wonder whether Dr Shylin could propose a mechanism for the formation of oxygen from the reaction of the Fe(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) complex with water.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I. Shylin</span> answered: The active species should be four-times oxidized to evolve oxygen from two water molecules. The Fe(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) complex characterized in our paper is only a one-electron oxidized species, and we suggest that it is oxidized further. Intermediates beyond Fe(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) appear to be too active, and hence are not observed in the steady-state spectra. Currently we are working on calculations of possible active species involved in oxygen evolution.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">James R. Durrant</span> enquired: To drive water oxidation, your catalyst is likely to need to undergo four oxidations. Do you have any evidence that the electron transfer kinetics change with the oxidation state of the catalyst?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I. Shylin</span> replied: At the moment we know that the overall oxygen evolution undergoes first-order kinetics, and that the initial electron transfer step is a first-order reaction as well. A detailed investigation of the following catalytic steps would certainly provide important additional insights into the reaction kinetics. However, in our flash photolysis experiment we excite only a small amount of photosensitizer and are thus restricted to monitoring the initial hole transfer step. Observation of hole transfer events at the second (or later) step will require quantitative transformation of the catalyst to a desired intermediate prior to the flash, something which has so far proven difficult to achieve.</p>

        <span class="bold">Sylvestre Bonnet</span> remarked: In Fig. 3 in your paper (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c8fd00167g" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/c8fd00167g">10.1039/c8fd00167g</a>) you show that photochemical water oxidation works at a constant rate for more than 60 s. In the experimental part you mention an experiment of 140 s. What happens after that time? Do you see the photocatalytic WO stopping? If you do, is the catalyst or the photosensitiser becoming inactive, or both? Did you try adding more photosensitiser or more catalyst to see if photocatalysis would resume?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I. Shylin</span> responded: Water oxidation stops after 150–240 s. We have found that the iron complex degrades during catalysis due to the decrease in the pH (2H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O → O<small><sub>2</sub></small> + 4H<small><sup>+</sup></small> + 4e<small><sup>¬</sup></small>). We cannot reactivate water oxidation after these 150–240 s by adding more buffer or base, but the TON can be improved by using more concentrated buffer from the beginning.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Erwin Reisner</span> continued: I have a question regarding the water oxidation mechanism involving the Fe catalyst. You have discussed a possible mechanism for the water oxidation catalysis involving a hepta-coordinate Fe–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O species and refer to previously reported Ru-based molecular water oxidation catalysts. However, Ru catalysts such as those reported by Sun and others involve a larger metal ion and a strained equatorial ligand environment, which enables water coordination. The Fe catalyst is well encumbered by the clathrochelate ligand and it is not clear how an aqua ligand would bind. Also, you mention an alternative water oxidation mechanism on the ligand – could you please elaborate on this further and provide more details (maybe also in the context of precedent literature or other evidence)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I. Shylin</span> responded: Indeed, the clathrochelate complex discussed in our paper is extremely rigid, so that the formation of the Fe=O oxo-species is questionable unless the integrity of the complex is lost. We are inclined to assume that O–O bond formation may occur on a ligand, whereas the metal center is involved indirectly and facilitates accumulation of holes. A mechanism involving ligand was proposed for the ruthenium “blue dimer” in ref. 1 (see Scheme 4), where an O–O bond is formed on carbon as a fragment of the four-membered endoperoxide ring, C<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>. We acknowledge that the mechanism of water oxidation using the clathrochelate complex remains elusive and is not discussed in our paper. Currently we are working on the modification of clathrochelate ligands in order to stabilize the active species (to make it ‘less active’). In parallel, calculation studies of the supposed intermediates are ongoing.</p>

        <span class="bold">Christine A.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I. Shylin</span> replied: The iron(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) clathrochelate complex spontaneously assembles in aqueous media from low-valent iron salts, oxalodihydrazide and formaldehyde in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. It is a simple one-pot template reaction that can be reproduced even in a minimally equipped school laboratory. The use of other aldehydes instead of formaldehyde would lead to modified clathrochelates, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> starting from iron(<span class="small_caps">III</span>), oxalodihydrazide and acetaldehyde, the methylated complex can be obtained.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christine A. Caputo</span> addressed a question to Wendy J. Shaw, Peter Brueggeller and Sergii I. Shylin: In many of these papers, the structure activity relationships rely on the synthesis of a library of ligands and complexes, which is a significant effort and often the synthetic modification is quite challenging. My question to the panel is: is the approach and the synthetic effort worth the payoff?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: In this context it is worthwhile to learn from nature also with respect to coordination chemistry. Nature has invented porphyrin ligands during evolution. From a preparative point of view these ligands would be very expensive when produced by chemists. On the other hand these ligands combine chelate and macrocyclic effects, which are absolutely necessary for the complexation of metals like magnesium. Also, for artificial photosynthesis one can postulate a simple rule: inexpensive metals like 3d metals lead to a more difficult coordination chemistry and there is the need for sophisticated ligands. Since at the end the costs for a whole artificial device count, the synthetic effort is worth the payoff, especially when earth-abundant metals come into play.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> replied: Yes. In order to get to a more sustainable future, we need to be able to develop better catalysts. From everything we know, the best way to do this is to mimic features of enzymes, not necessarily structurally but functionally. This requires good synthetic capabilities to test the proposed principles. For an ultimate application, the synthesis will need to be scalable, high yield and reasonably straight forward, but getting to a solution will require many syntheses, including homogeneous, heterogeneous, and biological. Investing in synthetic capabilities is essential to develop the catalysts we need to answer the fundamental questions we have.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> commented: Regarding photocatalytic water oxidation or hydrogen production, where the rate of gas evolution is plotted as a function of the irradiation time, the observed rate does not directly reflect the rate of any catalyst steps. Instead, it is equal to the rate of photon absorption times the quantum yield for product formation. Quantum yields are typically low, so most of the reaction is recombination or side reactions. Thus, a comparison of rates between different systems does not necessarily give information on the rate of the catalytic steps.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: In our photocatalytic HER experiments the Ir photosensitiser was clearly the less stable species, when compared with the WRC. However, the photosensitiser alone produces very poor HER results. This means that side reactions involving the photosensitisers can be neglected. Also the production of reactive nanoparticles has been ruled out by amalgam tests, thus excluding also these side reactions. Furthermore, we have studied a whole series of WRC, where only the metals differ in otherwise identical systems. So why not make the different metals used responsible for the observed HER? The proposed different catalytic cycles for the PNP–C1 and PNP–C2 ligands are confirmed by DFT calculations. However, I agree that these cycles are related to the forward reactions and indeed recombination reactions could also differ.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I. Shylin</span> responded: I agree with your comment. In our photocatalytic experiments, we used excess amounts of photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small>. Hence, we assumed that the overall performance of the photocatalytic system was determined by the catalyst. In addition, we investigated the kinetics of water oxidation using the one-electron oxidant [Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>3+</sup></small> (prepared separately) in darkness. In both the photochemical and chemical experiments, the initial rates of oxygen evolution exhibited a linear dependence on the catalyst concentration.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael Grätzel</span> continued: As a follow up of Prof. Hammarström’s question, the point is that the [Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>3+</sup></small> may not have a high enough redox potential to drive the oxidation of Fe(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) to Fe(<span class="small_caps">VI</span>) On the other hand the peroxosulfate anion radical formed as an intermediate from the one electron reduction of peroxodisulfate does have a high enough redox potential to drive this reaction. To rule out this possibility one would have to use a one electron oxidant such as Ce(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) to affect the water oxidation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I. Shylin</span> replied: That is true. We cannot completely exclude the impact of the sulfate radical on oxygen evolution in photochemical water oxidation. However, we have shown that [Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>3+</sup></small> prepared separately does evolve oxygen from water when added to the Fe(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) catalyst. Hence, [Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>3+</sup></small> is able to oxidize the catalyst beyond Fe(<span class="small_caps">V</span>). Alternatively, we could use ceric ammonium nitrate, but it would have required an acidic pH, something which we would like to avoid.</p>

        <span class="bold">Anastasia Vogel</span> directed a question to Wendy J. Shaw: Considering the interaction of the outer coordination sphere with both the active centre as well as the solvent, do you expect to see a solvent effect on the series of presented TONs/TOFs? If so, may there be an optimum pairing of solvent and outer coordination sphere residues?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> responded: Within a given solvent, I expect to see limited solvent effects. The solvent primarily affects the hydricity, so comparisons between solvent are the most meaningful. It is possible that as we go to a larger protein structure, the protein effectively shields the solvent in different ways, resulting in an effective solvent effect, but I would attribute this more to the scaffold than to the solvent. There is likely an optimum combination of solvent effects and scaffold effects, but ultimately I believe that being able to precisely control where particular atoms are, solvent or scaffold, will yield the best catalysts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anastasia Vogel</span> continued: Following up on the previous question, would you expect such a solvent effect on TONs/TOFs due to the interaction with the outer coordination sphere to be larger than other changes (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> changed mass transport due to different polarities of solvents)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> responded: I think there is that possibility. In the end, the rate-determining step for any given reaction will dictate what effects the solvent and the scaffold have. In this case, within a given solvent, there is no evidence of an overriding impact beyond controlling the hydricity.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joost N. H. Reek</span> asked: I really like your approach of controlling reactivity using the second coordination sphere, installing functional groups that are also playing important roles in enzyme cavities. Looking at the mechanism that you propose it seems that the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation (step 3) is RDS. (1) Do you have more detailed insight into how this CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation occurs?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(2) Mark Roberts demonstrates with his porphyrin based catalyst that the secondary interaction with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is important. In the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation step, negative charge accumulates on oxygen which means that cations or hydrogen bonds may stabilise the TS and thus speed up this reaction. You have not included such functional groups in your library. Have you considered functional groups that have hydrogen donors? Simple amine bonds may be sufficient.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> answered: Yes we considered amines, but due to the formation of carbamates, we have not pursued it. The Me–His system is not charged and we were unable to synthesize the arginine system. It is a great thought though and one we are now pursuing in the context of a structured protein scaffold. Regarding the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> addition for the Ph complexes, previous work by Linehan <span class="italic">et al.</span> in ref. 1 using a Co metal center calculated either a mechanism in which CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> bound, or one in which the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reacted directly with the hydride. The results were within a few kcal mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, so either option for the mechanism could be equally likely. We were hoping that the Rh system would provide more distinction. Unfortunately, with the Et complexes, extensive computational DFT studies do not provide agreement with the experimental studies, specifically the deprotonation step appears to be much easier in the calculations than is observed experimentally. We are continuing to apply more advance computational studies to address this, but at this stage, we do not have a definitive answer on the mechanism.</p>

        <span class="bold">Joost N. H. Reek</span> remarked: The ligands that you use have a lot of flexibility which could potentially lead to different conformations of these ligands around the metal center. It could be that the functional groups that you install on your ligands may influence the distribution of conformations How can you distinguish between real secondary sphere effects and an indirect effect in which the functional groups just changes the ligands conformations? Could phosphorus NMR be of any help?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> answered: Great observation – there is no doubt that the PNP ligands are moving relative to the metal center. This is further supported by ample studies on the P<small><sub>2</sub></small>N<small><sub>2</sub></small> ligands which do show structural restriction. We do not see any difference by <small><sup>31</sup></small>P-NMR and have done many low temperature experiments to investigate this. While we do not see any direct correlation with mobility, even in the P<small><sub>2</sub></small>N<small><sub>2</sub></small> rings which are much more motionally restricted, it is still difficult to create interactions which slow these motions. This can be done with groups that can interact with each other (aryl rings, or very long chains which can slow chair-to-boat interconversions). In this case we don’t have anything large enough to slow these interconversions. The aryl rings could potentially interact to lower the PNP mobility, but there is no evidence that this is correlated to the TOF. It is worth considering, and within the protein scaffold we are moving to we should be more able to evaluate the mobility of these ligands.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Sergii I.

If we investigate the water oxidation part of the system (indeed it is based on iron, the most abundant transition metal), we need to use the efficient photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> with known properties. We could use a noble metal-free light harvester, but our system would be limited by its efficiency. When an efficient catalyst is found and characterized, one can use it in a system to screen potential photosensitizers based on abundant elements.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> answered: Since the main focus of our paper concerning the ligands is on phosphines, it is interesting to note how these ligands change their coordination properties as soon as different metals are involved, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> using the expensive metal osmium produces chromophores which are stable for more than six weeks (see ref. 1). This is not possible for inexpensive 3d elements like nickel, which is certainly a consequence of the HSAB principle. The same considerations are also valid for WRCs: 3d elements usually show a more complicated coordination chemistry leading to less stable complexes than their more expensive 4d and 5d counterparts.</p>

        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> replied: In our case, we are focused on understanding how the outer coordination sphere works. In order to do this we need a well understood core catalyst and a good attachment point for the outer coordination sphere. The Rh(PNP)<small><sub>2</sub></small> system provided that. There is a similar system with Co that is also very well understood, unfortunately, it does not have a place to attach a protein to create a scaffold so it would not work to answer the questions we are interested in answering. In principle, the design principles we are developing should be extended to other metals and systems, so we do not see the use of a precious metal as limiting in this respect.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthias Beller</span> commented: It is not so important for these examples to move from noble to non-metal, the next step is to move to more integrated devices – it is more important to be using and implementing in real devices. This is interesting for organometallic chemistry but needs to be applied for artificial photosynthesis.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: I agree that it is a difficult task to think of real economically possible devices for artificial photosynthesis.

      <p class="otherpara">Another point is of course the sacrificial donor. Nature uses water and this should also be the goal for artificial systems. One has to keep in mind that the hitherto most efficient systems like Nocera’s artificial leaf are very expensive, in part also because of the membrane containing palladium. Another highly efficient device is certainly Eisenberg’s system using cadmium chalcogenides in the form of quantum dots for the chromophores (ref. 1).

        <span class="bold">Simon T. Clausing</span> then said: Systems for photocatalytic water splitting are often optimized towards their pH value. However, this is usually always the optimization towards a compromise: the sacrificial electron donor (for the water reduction side reaction) functions optimally at a high pH value, and the catalyst might be active at a far lower value, so the full system lies somewhere in between. Ultimately, however, the community wants to leave behind the dependence on sacrificial donors and acceptors. Would it therefore not be sensible to try and find a way to optimize the optimal conditions for only the catalyst, and not a combined catalyst-and-donor system? Have any of you thought of approaches to achieve this goal?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: It is true that in sacrificial systems the pH dependence may mainly reflect the pH dependence of the sacrificial donor used. Usually a lower pH is an advantage, since more protons are present. However, it is known in the literature that sacrificial donors like triethylamine show better reduction potential in more basic solutions. Hence, the result is a maximum usually in the range of pH 9–10. So the solution to this problem is of course the independence of sacrificial donors. One possibility is to deliver the electrons electrochemically. The second is to construct so-called combined systems where, as in nature, water is used as the electron donor.</p>

The spectra of the solution under study taken before and after electrolysis are identical. In addition, in our CV the peak current is linearly dependent on the square root of the scan rate that indicates a homogeneous process in solution, but not on the electrode surface.

In the transient absorption spectrum of the Ru* excited state, there is usually both a groundstate bleach as well as the emission spectrum. However, even at very short time scales of 20 ns, the emission component around 600 nm is already absent. I believe that these bands should probably be assigned to the Ru(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) instead.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: I agree that computationally predicting the best catalysts is still difficult. However, in our case DFT calculations show that during charge transfer and reduction of the WRC the metals seem to become too electron rich in the presence of anionic chlorido ligands. So the calculations predicted that the chlorido ligands are expelled from the coordination sphere as soon as the metals in the precatalysts are reduced. As a consequence we decided to already remove the chlorides from the precatalysts and use solvato complexes. Indeed the catalytic performance of the solvato complexes outperforms that of the corresponding chlorido complexes. This has also practical consequences: the use of salty sea water can be detrimental for the hydrogen evolution reaction.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> replied: The stability is based on the operation time and applied potential. If the photocharged sample is held at a constant potential (and under illumination), the current will slowly decrease over time and revert back to the value of the pure CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> electrode. We haven’t checked XPS after long term measurements, but we assume the decrease in photocurrent is due to the degradation of the borate layer.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Qian Wang</span> asked: You mentioned that several materials exhibited the same effect. However, different materials have different band structures. I was wondering how you confirm that the formed oxide layer will show suitable band structure matching that of the semiconductor as expected.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> responded: It has been shown here that in a borate electrolyte, the CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> photoanode forms a large band gap metal oxide on the surface. Similarly, for the BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small> photoanode in a borate electrolyte, a large band gap metal oxide made from borate forms on the surface, and for the BiVO4 photoanode in a phosphate electrolyte, a large band gap metal oxide made from phosphate forms on the surface. It happens that in these cases, metal oxides made with borate and phosphate have larger band gaps than those of BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> (and many of these materials exhibit glass-like properties). Therefore it happens that borate and phosphate electrolytes form borate- and phosphate-containing metal oxides which have larger band gaps than photoactive metal oxides, leading to beneficial charge separation/catalysis.</p>

Would the copper borate surface layer form faster when applying a slightly positive or negative potential during irradiation? Under those conditions, no photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution should occur; therefore, any small currents may be traced back to changes in the surface composition.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> answered: We have shown that applying a potential close to the photovoltage of the electrode, and for over 20 h in the dark, also promotes an improvement in the photoelectrochemical performance. However, the improvement is much smaller than that during the photo-induced process. This may be because of differences in charge carrier density, diffusion within the bulk of the material, and quasi-fermi level splitting during photon-induced photocharging, which favors passivation of surface states close to the illuminated surface.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Virgil Andrei</span> asked: The paper mentions that copper borates are proven photocatalysts. However, this layer can account for very little light absorption due to its thickness of only 5 nm. In this case, can it really be considered a photocatalyst, or does it act more as a passivating layer/electrocatalyst?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> responded: After finding that we most likely had a copper borate layer on our surface, we looked into the literature and saw that this material has recently been shown to have photocatalytic properties. Since the copper borate layer found on top of our CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> electrode was so thin, we do not believe it contributed to the light absorption and photocatalysis. Therefore, our comment about copper borate being a photocatalyst was from its previous use in the literature and not its activity in our work. For our paper, we believe that it indeed acted as a passivating layer and potentially as an electrocatalyst.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> replied: We used methanol as a hole scavenger for reasons of stability and enhanced oxidative performance. In the literature, it is typical to use methanol, hydrogen peroxide, or NaSO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, and here we chose methanol because it worked best with the CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> photoelectrode we use, while we use H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> for other materials such as BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The use of a sacrificial agent should be used to correlate current/voltage characteristics with and without this reactant, which can then provide information about catalytic and charge separation efficiency. The idea is that a sacrificial agent has a ‘maximum’ catalytic activity for a given material, so when the same electrode performs water oxidation without it, we can see how close/far from this ‘maximum’ behavior it is. Likewise, by including the incident photon flux and optoelectronic properties of the material (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> band gap), we can also roughly estimate the charge separation efficiency.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> answered: We find that surface hydroxylation improves catalysis, and occurs spontaneously in the dark when a (metal oxide) photoelectrode is placed in an electrolyte. After soaking in the electrolyte, and increasing hydroxylation (measured in a separate work by operando X-ray Raman spectroscopy), the PEC performance improves. For the case of MeOH oxidation, this was used as a sacrificial oxidative reaction that should occur more easily than water oxidation, and indeed we see high photocurrents and lower onset potentials for this reaction.</p>

        <span class="bold">James R. Durrant</span> commented: Your talk gave some very interesting insights. Could you comment on what you mean by the term ‘photocharging’? I note that in your figure illustrating photoanode function, your ‘photocharged’ photoanode is not drawn with more charge.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> answered: The term photocharging is indeed somewhat of a misnomer. Many years ago when we first discovered the phenomenon using BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, the PhD student at the time (now Dr Bartek Trzesniewksi), thought the enhanced performance looked like the system had been charged like a battery, and hence called it ’photocharging’. The name does not mean that there is excess charge on the surface (though the surface chemistry does change), so I/we understand that the name is not ideal and may be somewhat misleading if taken literally. We will try to re-name the phenomenon in subsequent work.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">James R. Durrant</span> continued: I note that in your electrode energy level diagram the copper borate valence band is deeper than that of copper tungstate. Could you comment on how water oxidation proceeds on this electrode, and particularly where photogenerated holes accumulate to drive this reaction?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> answered: The band diagram was drawn for illustrative purposes, and is by no means exact. First, the layer of copper borate is less than 5 nm, and thus may not be thick enough to form an appreciable layer that has a large enough density of states to make a formal or well-defined band structure. In addition, there are 2 structural forms of copper borate (CuB<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> and Cu<small><sub>3</sub></small>B<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>6</sub></small>) with 2 different band gaps (3.1 eV and 2.16 eV). Due to the non-qualitative nature of the XPS results that showed a change of Cu valence, and an increase in a unique O feature and B peak, we cannot definitively say which composition of copper borate we found. As we did not see an appreciable change in the band gap or band edge, we made the implicit assumption for this diagram that the larger band gap copper borate was there, leading to the figure as drawn. We also saw evidence of enhanced charge separation, which is more likely with a hetero-junction with a large band gap material compared to that with a smaller band gap material. Our illustration was not meant to be qualitative, and is only schematic to show the materials properties change we measured (0.4 eV shift in Fermi level), improved catalysis/charge separation, and new Cu/O/B signals from the surface.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Putting this all together, we believe that photogenerated holes in CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> may tunnel through the very thin layer of copper borate, where this layer only provides enhanced charge separation in the space charge region, which may also aid in hole accumulation compared to the bare CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small>/electrolyte interface.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Chanon Pornrungroj</span> remarked: Could you elaborate more on the comment you made about the day–night cycle (charge/discharge) of the CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> layer and how it would affect the long-term stability of this material?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> replied: We observe that the process of the surface heterojunction forming occurs during illumination, and is removed when the light is turned off. Therefore, in a practical system that turns on and off every day when the sun goes up and down, the surface oxide layer will form, dissolve, and re-form every single day. If the removal of the layer removes Cu or W from the electrode, then each cycle will physically degrade the electrode and over time will remove all of the photoactive material. Therefore, although the photocharging technique brings significant improvement in photoelectrochemical performance, its practical utilization could be hindered by catalyst dissolution in the dark.</p>

        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> replied: This is a great question, and it seems this may be different for every material that can photocharge. We see from XPS that the surface valence of Cu changes, but there is a reduction in the Cu<small><sup>+</sup></small> peak, which correlates to the oxidation of Cu by anionic adsorption. So far, we cannot account for the photogenerated electrons, but it may relate to bulk defect chemistry which we hope to probe in the coming years.</p>

        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> responded: The CuWO<small><sub>4</sub></small> photoanode we study has a slightly smaller band gap than BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, but after a few years of research it seems that its optoelectronic and catalytic properties cannot be improved like BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small> despite efforts of doping, surface passivation and the use of co-catalysts. I think this brings up an important point in the search for ’winning’ materials in the field of photoelectrochemistry. Even if a new metal oxide photoelectrode can convert all of the incident sunlight to electrical/chemical energy, I have serious doubts about the scalability of this approach to scale up to meet TW, GW or even MW needs. Efforts should instead focus on understanding mass transport, reactor engineering, and scaling up of this technology, which need to be solved in parallel to materials optimization.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ravi Shankar</span> added: Following on from Professor Grätzel’s comment, what do you think the key limitations are for solar fuel production through photoelectrochemistry? Do you envision some sort of feedback loop?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> answered: I think the key limitations for solar fuel production through photoelectrochemistry (PEC) are predominantly engineering: mass transport, reactor engineering, process intensification, process integration, <span class="italic">etc.</span> The field has been focused on materials properties for four decades, and we are still not in a place close to commercialization or industrial applications. While we do still need to find photo and electrocatalysts to perform key redox reactions (with low overpotential, high stability and high selectivity), we need a massive increase in the areas that look to apply these materials in practical systems. For example, we need to already think: what if we find an ’ideal’ material that meets all of the metrics we pose on PEC? Then what? We need to already be thinking about this now, so that when in the next years or decades we do find these materials, we can already put them in a place to upscale.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">We cannot wait to find the ’ideal’ material, then worry about making the process at the MW, GW or TW scale. In addition, from other fields where large scale electrolysis is performed, it may turn out that the process conditions needed for practical applications are far removed from where a majority of lab-scale testing is done. That means that we may be optimizing the performance and understanding of materials and processes in a regime that is not industrially relevant. Therefore, we absolutely need a positive feedback loop between engineers and materials scientists/chemists to understand what a large scale system may look like in order to give us more realistic conditions to improve materials and systems in a laboratory scale, that can have a faster pathway towards industrial applications.</p>

        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> replied: That is a great question. For a ’practical’ cell, there would need to be at least 2 photoactive materials, as significant modelling work has shown that the best approach to get a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency is with a tandem absorber configuration. Therefore, if a metal oxide is the top layer, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> interfacing with the electrolyte, it would always receive a voltage boost from the bottom absorbing material, which would indeed not be true open circuit conditions.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aubrey R. Paris</span> answered: We initially showed that the choice of solid support can influence catalytic activity, specifically for the Ni<small><sub>3</sub></small>Ga intermetallic, in ref. 1. Following thorough materials characterization, we suggested that the differences in catalytic activity (including product distribution) observed for this species on different carbons could be attributed to changes in surface composition and morphology. In the report prepared for this Faraday Discussion, we decided to probe the carbon support dependence further. The most interesting result of these experiments was the fact that carbon solid supports could not reinstate multi-carbon generation ability for non-intermetallic Ni–Ga films. This result supports our 2018 report, which does not attribute a direct role to the carbon in influencing catalytic behavior (rather, its effect is indirect in dictating the composition and morphology of the surface during catalyst synthesis). However, a consistent point of interest in our 2018 paper and the study presented here is the fact that thin films deposited on glassy carbon and reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC), which are structurally similar materials, generate the same products from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> but in different Faradaic efficiencies. Specifically, RVC-grown films exhibit approximately double the Faradaic efficiency for each carbon-containing product compared to those on glassy carbon. This is unexpected, because the greater surface area of RVC films should not intuitively result in greater Faradaic efficiencies (if anything, a greater current density would be expected). We have yet to understand the chemical reasoning for this observation.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aubrey R. Paris</span> replied: Based on the results of the D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O electrolyte experiments, it is likely that CO reduction is rate-limiting. However, I should caution that whether or not this is true depends on why the D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is affecting the system as it is. For example, if the D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is simply slowing down the reaction pathway that is active in H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O-based electrolyte, then CO reduction should be rate-limiting, but this would not necessarily be the case if the presence of D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O activates a different catalytic pathway for the system.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In our initial report about the multi-carbon product generation ability of intermetallic Ni<small><sub>3</sub></small>Al (ref. 1) we used the rate of liquid product formation to hypothesize the rate-determining step of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> electroreduction. In essence, we found that supplying the system with CO feedstock instead of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> resulted in faster product generation, so we suggested that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction to CO might be rate-limiting. Based on the D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O experiments described in this work, however, that may not actually be the case. A more thorough understanding of the nature of D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O’s effect would likely help discriminate between these two rate-limiting step possibilities.</p>

This actually tends to be the optimal condition for many of the heterogeneous CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction catalysts studied in our lab, frequently resulting in our selection of K<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> as an electrolyte, because it requires a very small amount of KHCO<small><sub>3</sub></small> to achieve a buffered solution close to pH 4.5. We also often select K<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> for our electrolyte because we perform pH dependence studies with any new catalyst we develop, and the K<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>/KHCO<small><sub>3</sub></small> combination allows for examination of a wide pH range (approximately 3.5–7.5). Experiments using D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O were indeed prepared in the same manner.</p>

        <span class="bold">Wendy J. Shaw</span> queried: You stated that the role to make multiple carbon chains is indirect. Can you provide any more comments or speculation on this mechanism?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aubrey R. Paris</span> responded: I would not call the mechanism indirect, but rather the experiments we used to begin probing it were indirect indicators of what it may or may not look like. At this point, we seem to understand that generating multi-carbon chains on these nickel–Group 13 metals is predicated on intermetallic character, suggesting that the role of the two metals is synergistic, or electronic, in nature. This does not rule out the possibility that the two metals on the surface could also provide distinct binding sites to further stabilize CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> or the reduction intermediates, but our experiments here do indicate that this "co-stabilization" effect is not the sole reason for multi-carbon product generation. The next steps in further understanding the reduction mechanism should definitely focus on interpreting the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O/D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O effect. Because it is possible to imagine many reasons for this unexpected effect, experiments ruling out certain reasons would be extremely informative. These experiments could include <span class="italic">in situ</span> studies to examine differences in surface-bound reduction intermediates in the presence of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O <span class="italic">versus</span> D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. Importantly, because we have now observed this effect in four different CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction systems (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the two discussed here, plus our recent report on a Cr–Ga oxide alloy and another unpublished catalyst from our lab), it seems to be at least a somewhat conserved effect. Understanding it could tell us a lot about CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> electroreduction systems as a whole.</p>

        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> commented: The idea of bimetallic or alloy catalysts is interesting from the perspective of changing selectivity according to the composition of active sites for different reactions. However, when you apply the same potential to different metals, not only do they have different selectivities, but they also may have different current densities. What are your thoughts about the activity/current density distribution for bimetallic or alloy catalysts, and how differences in activity on different metallic sites can affect overall selectivity and mechanistic understanding?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aubrey R. Paris</span> replied: You raise a really important point regarding the design of these electrocatalytic systems. Eliciting two specific reduction events on two distinct surfaces (in the same electrochemical cell) requires compatible electrochemical conditions for the two surfaces, such as an optimized operating potential, pH, and electrolyte salt. This is why I note in the conclusion section of the paper that a single alloy or intermetallic species should theoretically be easier to optimize than coupling two distinct electrodes performing complementary tasks. Nonetheless, this complication does not negate the mechanistic assertions made in the paper, because the product distributions achieved using the "striped" or non-alloyed electrodes seem to be combinations of the product distributions found using single-metal controls.</p>

Please discuss the pros and cons of these two approaches for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction and indicate which approach is preferred.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aubrey R. Paris</span> replied: Choosing whether an electrochemical or photochemical approach is "preferred" depends largely on one’s goal for the research. If the goal is to create a system that could be industrially implemented immediately, electrochemical CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction has an upperhand, because much more progress has been made in electrochemical catalytic systems in recent decades. Indeed, many desirable products are already achievable at impressive Faradaic efficiencies using electrocatalysts. This certainly doesn’t mean that photoelectrochemical CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction research should be abandoned, but it simply doesn’t boast the same amount of progress as the electrochemical analog. That said, with more fundamental research, photoelectrochemistry has the potential to help address one of the lasting challenges of electrochemical CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction: impractical overpotential requirements.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wilson A. Smith</span> replied: In the short term (which is the time frame where solutions are needed), the best approach has to be renewable electrolysis (where an electrolyser can be powered by any renewable electricity supply – not just PV) over direct photoelectrochemistry. The technological development of PV panels is too robust, and large electrolysers already exist, but are expensive. However, large CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> electrolysers do not exist, so significant efforts should be made towards developing these by translating fundamental lab scale research to an industrial scale. On the other hand, the PEC approach still not only suffers from low efficiencies and material stability issues, but even in the best case scenarios no real upscaling has been done at a practical level. While this avenue should still be interesting to pursue, it may only be viable in a long term timeframe (at best). Therefore the fastest way to engineer a solar fuel system is to use two known and scaled technologies instead of one unproven technology that has never been made at a large scale.</p>

If you aim for an application but you establish a twenty-step synthesis, I hardly can believe that this will go into an industrial application.

In the introduction you use the active site of enzymes such as hydrogenase as inspiration for the preparation of your heterogeneous catalyst materials. The question is whether this is the correct source of inspiration, as the active site only is not a good catalyst. There are thousands of hydrogenase mimics but all require a relatively large overpotential for proton reduction catalysis. Work by Lubitz and Fontecave (ref. 1) demonstrated that an artificial hydrogenase mimic can be put into an apohydrogenase enzyme, restoring full activity. This shows that the activity of the enzyme is for a large part determined by the peptide environment around the active site rather then the active site. If we use just the active site as an inspiration, we may have the wrong starting point, as we do not take into account the environment.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> replied: This is a very interesting question and you are absolutely right that mimics usually operate under different conditions. The example you mentioned is a perfect one. However, if you carefully check the [FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics in solution and when incorporated into HydA, it is obvious that they reveal different structures. The structural change is, as highlighted by you, adjusted by the peptide environment. As such, a different reactivity is expected.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">I do, however, believe that bioinspired mimics are still very valuable and that nature gives a lead to come up with new materials. Let me explain this further. Our material contains a cuboidal metal-sulfur structure which can be assumed as a mimic for the [4Fe–4<span class="italic">S</span>] clusters that enable electron transport in nature. Likewise to nature, our materials show high conductivity when used in electrochemical experiments. Furthermore, pentlandites reveal short metal–metal interactions that also cover the surface of the material. These structural fragments are comparable to the ones observed in nature and we could recently show that these are important for the material’s reactivity. While I agree that this attempt might lead to a wrong starting point, it is one potential inspiration to build new materials and should not be excluded. In the end, we cannot forecast the reactivity of materials and require some kind of inspiration.</p>

Materials, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> stable alloys, can be found here that catalyze various reduction processes. Under normal conditions such alloys would normally be surface oxidized and not very reactive. As such, I believe that the environmental conditions indeed aid changing redox properties and also stabilize the reactive intermediates (or at least do not trigger their decomposition).</p>

        <span class="bold">Michael Grätzel</span> commented: A few years ago there was lots of excitement in the scientific community about the virtues of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a hydrogen evolution catalyst. How does your Fe/Ni sulfide compare with MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> replied: While comparing two distinct different sulfides is certainly desired, such a comparison is very difficult, probably misleading and simplifies the problem set too much. The structure of Fe/Ni pentlandite is not at all comparable with MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> and results in different properties of this material. In contrast to MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the bulk pentlandite is highly conductive due to its unique structure. In addition, pentlandites are very stable under acidic and basic conditions as long as they are kept under reductive conditions. Likewise, the mechanisms of both materials in generating hydrogen seem to be very different. I believe, however, that the major difference (and probably an advantage for application) between pentlandites and MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is that with the Fe/Ni sulfides we do not require a specific nanostructure to achieve good activity.</p>

        <span class="bold">Katarzyna Sokol</span> asked: Have you tried or considered other synthesis methods for the particles in order to make them smaller and better control their size? With such a degree of aggregation, and particle sizes in the range of hundreds of nanometers, you will be losing the quantum size effects, and the band gap and conduction band edge should be close to the bulk material. Is there an advantage of using the particles in this case, with so many alternative electrode film deposition methods available? Have you considered making the particles smaller, in the range of 10 nanometers or less, to increase the band gap and possibly shift the conduction band edge to be more negative?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> answered: We attempted the synthesis by various methods. The major problem is, however, that the pentlandite has a high temperature phase and low temperatures usually facilitate the formation of other phases. So the formation of defined nanoparticles is a borderline problem. Unfortunately, there are currently no electrode film deposition methods available for this particular material. We are currently working on this issue to make thin films. But at the moment, we have not achieved this goal.</p>

        <span class="bold">Anna Hankin</span> said: Could you comment on the accuracy of using the Mott–Schottky approach for determining the band edge positions in your materials, especially since the charge carrier densities in the materials are not known? Have you tried to compare Mott–Schottky results with other measurements, such as chopped photocurrent?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> answered: My personal impression is that the Mott–Schottky approach is very cumbersome and error-prone. Small variations during the impedance measurements can lead to significant alterations. As such, I do expect a non-negligible error of the presented values. We have not yet measure chopped photocurrents but will certainly perform this measurement.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew B. Bocarsly</span> remarked: From an experimental point of view, the flat band potential is best determined using light intensity dependent open circuit photopotential measurements. This technique avoids the unknown impedances, and frequency dependence of the Mott–Schottky analysis.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> responded: You are absolutely right and we plan to do this in the near future.</p>

        <span class="bold">Flavia Cassiola</span> commented: The material you reported has intriguing properties that should be investigated further as proposed in your paper. During the discussion you commented that the stability of Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>Ni<small><sub>6</sub></small>S<small><sub>8</sub></small> is not high on your priority list at the moment because the material is considered very cheap and its replacement is consequently not an issue. Thinking ahead, as you develop the potential of the Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>Ni<small><sub>6</sub></small>S<small><sub>8</sub></small> photocatalytic activity (with or without co-catalysts), one suggestion would be to consider stability and durability of the material in the earliest stages of development. Although the material is cheap and abundant, in a real device in an industrial scale the material should not be replaced in every reaction cycle. One suggestion is to consider stability studies as you proceed with future developments (band gap tuning of the pentlandites, nanoengineering of the particle sizes and further optimization of their elemental compositions as improvements on photocatalytic properties). How would you speculate on the stability of the material with your results and at your current development stage? Does this insight on stability change your current ways of thinking regarding the application of Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>Ni<small><sub>6</sub></small>S<small><sub>8</sub></small> in a photosynthesis device?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> replied: You are absolutely right pointing out that stability is one of the most important parameters for an industrial application. We solely investigated the stability under electrochemical conditions. Herein, stability is not an issue. After talking to some of my industrial partners I am currently not convinced, however, that photocatalytic applications for hydrogen generation will enter industry soon. As such, I did not focus too much on the stability of this material but was rather curious as to whether we can trigger a photocatalytic process with it. It is definitely on my to-do list to also investigate the stability in the near future with a better material and I am certain that, likewise to electrocatalysis, stability is not an issue. But still, even a high stability of our material under photocatalytic conditions would (at the moment) not change my mind regarding its application in a photosynthetic device.</p>

        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> said: At this conference the question of what the best way to find potential photocatalysts is has arisen. One rationale is that the electrocatalytic activity is often only a calculated number, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> a theoretical proton reduction with a turnover frequency of more than 100<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 per second has been calculated for some DuBois’ catalysts in ref. 1. However, the corresponding photocatalytic activity in the form of experimental hydrogen production analysis only leads to a TON of 11.4. Since the compounds in U.-P. Apfel’s paper (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c8fd00173a" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/c8fd00173a">10.1039/c8fd00173a</a>) show an interesting electrocatalytic behaviour with a possible photocatalytic application, I wonder whether the authors of this session could comment on the differences between theoretical electrocatalytic activities and resulting experimental photocatalytic hydrogen determinations.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> responded: I am not certain if one should really compare photocatalytic and electrocatalytic conditions. The reaction conditions applied are very different. While an electrocatalyst should be potentially capable of performing this reaction also under photochemical conditions, this is not always the case and usually the photosensitizer and sacrificial electron donor are an important component that do not always receive the right attention when discussing different TON/TOF values. In addition, likewise the product composition can be altered as was shown by the Robert group with their photo- <span class="italic">vs.</span> electro-chemical CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction experiments (ref. 1–3).</p>

        <span class="bold">Andrew B. Bocarsly</span> posed a question to Ulf-Peter Apfel and Chia-Yu Lin: Both of you use earth abundant elements in your semiconducting electrodes, but show that these materials introduce all kinds of new complications with respect to electrode stability and response. Do you believe that we are better off using more expensive materials which exhibit fewer electrochemical complications or should our studies continue with less expensive materials and engineer them to be "good" materials?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ulf-Peter Apfel</span> replied: I personally believe that it is a necessity to proceed with earth-abundant metals/materials. While we certainly do have issues with the stability now, I am convinced that we can overcome these problems. We need materials that are abundant to reduce the current investment costs and to push electro- and photo-chemical devices out of a niche existence into large-scale technology.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Chia-Yu Lin</span> answered: Noble metals do indeed have better performance in most cases, but in some cases, noble metals cannot solve our problems, such as mitigation of chloride oxidation. In addition, some reactions require less expensive materials to activate. Therefore, both kinds of material require further investigation.</p>
