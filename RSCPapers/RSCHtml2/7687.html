        <span class="italic">This review period has shown several areas of growth. The increase in popularity of LIBS continues as the problems, both real and perceived, that are associated with it (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, that it is capable only of qualitative analyses) are overcome. The area that appears to have seen the greatest increase in LIBS work is the nuclear industry. Presumably this is because of the stand-off ability of the technique. Another technique that is increasing in popularity is continuum source AAS. This has found substantial use in several areas of the review, notably the fuels and the organic chemicals sections. As noted in the review, the technique allows similar multi-elemental detection to ICP-OES (albeit at lower sensitivity), but at AAS running costs and is therefore likely to remain a popular technique. The necessity of causing no or minimal damage to forensic samples and for samples of archaeological or historical importance is still paramount. Therefore, micro-sampling techniques such as LIBS, LA and various X-ray-based techniques are still popular. Since the reliability of the data obtained from hand-held/portable XRF instruments has improved significantly in recent times, the use of these can be regarded as almost routine. Also noted in the review is the propensity for using multiple techniques, often simultaneously, to characterize materials more fully and more rapidly. This is the latest review covering atomic spectrometric measurements of industrial materials, metals, chemicals and advanced materials. It follows on from last year's review<small><sup>1</sup></small> and should be read in conjunction with other reviews in the series.<small><sup>2–5</sup></small> This year has seen the departure of Sian Shore from the writing team. Her efforts over the last few years have been very much appreciated.</span>

      <h2 id="sect435"><span class="a_heading">1. Metals</span></h2>
      <span>For all types of metals and alloys, the most interesting contributions continue to centre on solid sample analysis methods. There continues to be a large number of papers in which a number of different spectroscopic methods and non-spectrometric methods were applied to the problem of interest. The overall distribution by instrumental method of papers reviewed for the metals section (as a percentage of papers received) was: AAS 4%, OES 35% (LIBS included at 12%), MS 11%, AFS 3%, SIMS 2%, XRF 14% and the use of multiple instrumental methods 30%. The papers of a fundamental nature were not cited in the review but were included in the distribution breakdown.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect439"><span class="b_heading">1.1. Ferrous metals and alloys</span></h3>
        <span>A comparison of five analytical methods for the <span class="italic">determination of Mg in low alloy steel</span> was conducted by Recknagel <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Spark-OES, ICP-OES, ICP-TOF-MS, ICP-QMS and GD-MS were used to measure Mg in three different samples and the average concentrations of 2.0, 2.8, and 10.3 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were obtained. Overall, precision expressed as RSD yielded values of 20–30%, which although large, were considered to be acceptable by the authors.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Tellez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> recommended the <span class="italic">combined use of SIMS, focused ion beam, XRD, white light interferometry and reflectance spectroscopy</span> to characterize the artificial blue patina created on mild steel. These methods provided information about the metal oxide film morphology, surface composition, elemental distributions within the coloured layer and how the surface colour developed. The segregation of B (50 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) at the austenite grain boundaries in 0.5% carbon steels was studied by Seol <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> who used APT and nano-beam SIMS for the analysis. Boro-carbide formation was identified using SIMS and measurements from APT determined B concentration at the grain boundaries to be 1.7 ± 0.2%, which was about 70 times the concentration added to the steel.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several authors have used <span class="italic">LIBS for steel analysis</span>. Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> determined Cr and Mn in carbon steel using LIBS and, after optimization of the operating conditions, reported (in Chinese) LODs of 0.046% (Mn) and 0.005% (Cr). Two methods of calibration were compared and it was concluded that the internal standardization method was better than the traditional calibration method because the correlation coefficients were significantly higher. A LIBS sensor was developed by Anabitarte <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> to detect the presence of a protective coating on boron steel prior to welding. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at an energy of 600 mJ, a pulse duration of 16 ns and a repetition rate of 2 Hz was used to ablate the sample. The laser beam was focussed onto the surface of the sample using a mirror and a biconvex lens. Light emitted from the sample was focussed using a second bi-convex lens onto an optical fibre which transmitted the light to a Czerny Turner monochromator and a 2048 pixel detector capable of detection over the wavelength range 350–450 nm. A comparison of spectra obtained from regions of a steel plate that had the protective coating and from unprotected areas showed significant differences, with the unprotected areas providing complex spectra containing lines originating from Fe, Mn, Cr and, to a lesser extent, B. The spectra obtained from the areas containing the protective layer were much more simple and contained lines originating predominantly from Al. The presence of the aluminium–silicon covering on the steel during welding can form inclusions in the weld which significantly reduces the weld strength. The spectral algorithm was used with support vector machines to mark areas where aluminium was present before welding.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">elemental distribution within the sub-surface of advanced high strength steels</span> after different annealing trials was reported by Norden <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> The element distribution was determined using GD-OES and adjusted to consider selective oxidation products for modelling purposes. Modelling indicated the sub-surface transformation temperature was substantially different than for the bulk and was confirmed empirically.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Karasev <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> described how oxide particles in alloys and steels were rapidly determined using <span class="italic">LA-ICP-MS</span>. The number, size and particle size distribution obtained using LA-ICP-MS were comparable to particles collected on a filter after electrolytic extraction. It was acknowledged that the comparison was limited since some of the soluble oxide particles were not collected by the filter. The method was adequate for the analysis of inclusions containing aluminium oxide, magnesium oxide <span class="italic">etc.</span> Small slag inclusions trapped in metal armour pieces were analysed using both LA-ICP-MS and confocal SR μ-XRF to obtain trace element information in a preliminary report by Leroy <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> This paper presented an analytical protocol for analysing these types of inclusions to elucidate the origin of the armour. A comparison set of data was developed by analysing inclusions in armour pieces known to be made in the Middle Ages from the Lombardy (Italy) region. The two methods were viewed as complementary. Measurements by LA-ICP-MS were limited by the small ablated volumes and confocal SR μ-XRF was limited by the few elements excited by the conventional source at approximately 20 keV.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several papers appeared that discussed the <span class="italic">determination of non-metallic elements in steel</span>. Yu and Wang<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> studied B in low carbon steel using SIMS and Raman spectroscopy before and after hot rolling of the sample. Originally it existed mainly as free B in the steel matrix. After hot rolling and annealing, most of the B was observed as boron nitride compounds. The B segregated to the austenite grain boundaries thereby improving the toughness of the steel. A combination of μ-XRF, μ-XANES and μ-Raman spectroscopy was applied to studying the forms of P in ancient iron samples as described by Monnier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> The P was heterogeneously distributed in the corrosion products and XANES measurements indicated that P existed as phosphate complexes in iron corrosion products. Nitrogen was determined in steel using pulsed GD-TOF-MS in a paper by Ganeev <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> The method was successfully applied to steel samples with different concentrations of N and the LOD was estimated to be 0.03%.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">portable XRD</span>/<span class="italic">XRF spectrometer</span> was used <span class="italic">in situ</span> by Suzumura <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> to determine the changes in iron oxides on railhead surfaces, which can influence wheel/rail rolling contact parameters. Studies were undertaken both in the laboratory and in the field where a test vehicle passed over a corroded section of track several times. The reduction of the oxide layer was influenced by the alignment of the rail and wheel and the vehicle running conditions (driving, freewheeling and braking).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An experiment by Ishida <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> demonstrated that Mn absorbance using AAS in the vapour above molten steel correlated very well with the <span class="italic">Mn concentration in the molten steel</span>. The light emitted from the molten metal acts as the light source for the experiment and Mn could be measured up to a limit of 3%. This warrants more comment but the paper was published in Japanese and there were few details in the English abstract. Perhaps, these authors will publish more of this work in other journals.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect488"><span class="b_heading">1.2. Non-Ferrous metals and alloys</span></h3>
        <span>A <span class="italic">literature review</span> containing 98 references focusing on the characterization of ancient (9<small><sup>th</sup></small>–19<small><sup>th</sup></small> centuries) gilded art objects was written by Sandu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> In this context, gilded was defined as the application of gold or similar metals (Ag, Cu and other metals) to art objects such as easel or mural paintings, wood pieces, leather or parchment. It was noted that the most reliable and complete information comes from using a variety of techniques (non-invasive or non-/minimally destructive): UV fluorescence photography, IR reflectography, X-radiography, thermography, SEM, TEM, AFM, μ-FTIR, μ-Raman, X-ray spectrometry (WDXRF, EDXRF, TXRF and XPS) and Ion Beam Analyses (PIXE, PIGE, RBS and SRS). The authors asserted that the microscope remains the most used and efficient tools for characterizing these materials. A review of interest was prepared by Young<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> who, with the aid of 81 references, described the use of SR in archaeometallurgy. Since this type of sample is sometimes fragile and is certainly irreplaceable, minimal damage should be inflicted during analysis. Techniques discussed in the review included X-ray imaging (radiography/microscopy and tomography), XRD, XRF spectrometry and FTIR spectroscopy.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Several <span class="italic">archaeological studies</span> have been reported. Mohamed and Darweesh<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> studied ancient Egyptian black-patinated copper alloys employing optical microscopy, SEM, EDXRF, XRD and FTIR. Results indicated that the black patina consisted mostly of tenorite (CuO). There was also evidence of thermal patination and animal glue coating on the copper. A collection of 19 fragments thought to be from the same ancient bronze vessel from Sumhuram (present day Oman) were characterized by Chaivari <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> using SEM-EDAX, μ-Raman spectroscopy, FAAS and XRD. The alloy in each sample was identified as being leaded bronze, but three different groups were identified based on the composition and microstructure of the fragments; indicating that they came from different vessels. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was used as a screening tool for identifying whether some Roman lead curse tablets were manufactured from ore bodies in Africa Proconsularis (Tunisia).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> The work by Skaggs <span class="italic">et al.</span> showed that Ag, As, Cu, and Sb were likely marker elements for local ores. A set of 96 tablets was screened using EPMA and 16 tablets were identified for further testing for Pb isotope ratios using TIMS. Twelve of the 16 tablets had Pb isotope ratios which matched isotope ratios of local ore bodies. This suggested that the Romans were mining local ores rather than relying only on imported lead for manufacturing.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A variety of methods were applied to the analysis of <span class="italic">modern industrial alloys</span>. Anawati <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> used a combination of SEM, TEM, XPS, SIMS and GD-OES to understand the interaction of Cu and trace concentrations of Pb in aluminium–lead–copper alloys. There was no evidence of co-segregation of Cu with Pb or any physical interaction between Pb and Cu near the metal–oxide interface, which might explain the passivating effect of Cu on aluminium–lead alloys. A study of the structure, corrosion, and hardness of zinc–nickel alloys electroplated on to 347 steel aircraft material was conducted by Gnanamuthu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The techniques used were: XRD (alloy phases), SEM (microstructural morphology), AFM (topography) and XRF (elemental composition). A layer of 88% Zn and 12% Ni formed by pulsed electrode deposition at 50 Hz and a 40% duty cycle had better corrosion resistance than the other deposited layers tested. The mechanism and kinetics of electrochemical hydriding of binary magnesium–nickel and ternary magnesium–nickel–M (where M can be cerium, lanthanum, neodymium or praseodymium) alloys were studied by Vojtech and Knotek<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> through the use of GD-OES, SEM, EDXRF, XRD and MS. The experiment was conducted in a 6 M KOH solution at 20 °C and 80 °C for 480 minutes. An alloy of magnesium–nickel was also tested as an experimental control.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There were many studies where results were obtained by <span class="italic">a single spectroscopic method</span>, as shown in the following four paragraphs. The results of an inter-laboratory comparison were reported by Uemoto <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> for the determination of metals in silver brazing alloys (silver–copper–zinc–cadmium and silver–copper–zinc–tin). Comparable results were found for all alloys by gravimetric, titrimetric and ICP-OES methods. The tin-containing alloy required dissolution with HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> to prevent precipitation of hydrous tin(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) oxide whereas the other alloy required only HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> for dissolution. Hassler <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> studied the determination of 22 trace elements in high purity copper using ETV-ICP-OES. The compound CHF<small><sub>3</sub></small> was the most effective gaseous halogenated agent tested that provided sufficient analyte–matrix separation. The gas flow rates through the ETV device were set at 0.185 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Ar and 0.0033 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for CHF<small><sub>3</sub></small>. All elements, except for Se and Te, were completely released from the copper matrix and were determined accurately in a copper CRM. Limits of detection were reported to range from 0.6 to 29 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Deuterium in zircaloy was determined by Marpaung <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> using a custom built pico-second LIBS system. Optimal operating conditions were determined to be a laser energy of 7 mJ, a helium pressure of 1.3 kPa and a measuring window lasting 50 μs. Calibration standards were made by doping zircaloy pieces with D at different concentrations. This provided a calibration curve with a zero intercept and a LOD of 10 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This was well below the limit of hydrogen concentration that could cause damage to the alloy. An additional advantage of the method was that it produced a crater of only 25 μm diameter and therefore could be regarded as being only minimally destructive. The study was claimed to be a pre-cursor to studying hydrogen in zircaloy. A scanning LIBS system was combined with a 3 dimensional object detection system to sort recycled metal.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> The authors, Werheit <span class="italic">et al.</span>, designed the system to accommodate single pieces moving at 3 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> through a measuring volume of 600 × 600 × 100 mm<small><sup>3</sup></small>. Data, from 20 channels of a high resolution Paschen-Runge spectrometer, were processed within a few microseconds. The system was able to identify eight different Al alloy types with an average correctness of &gt;95%. Wrought and cast aluminium pieces were classified with an accuracy of &gt;96%, after 20% of the measurements were discarded as outliers. The authors claimed this system has the potential to sort single aluminium pieces at a rate of 4 tonnes per hour.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Wienold <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> investigated different <span class="italic">calibration strategies</span> for the determination of elements in copper metal using LA-ICP-MS utilizing an IR laser. There were differences in the measured concentrations between calibration with copper metal CRMs and calibration with liquid doped pressed copper powders. Although the pressed copper powders matched the composition and the ablated particle size distributions of CRMs, they did not match the overall ablation behaviour because of differences in the physical condition and chemical form of the analytes. It was concluded that the weak cohesion between copper particles gave rise to a higher ablation rate than ablation from solid copper metal. The opposite conclusion was reached by Gusarova <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> who found synthetic Cu and Zn pressed powder pins acceptable for calibrating double focusing GD-MS during the determination of 50 elements. Copper and zinc-based CRMs were used for validation. A new sample holder design accommodated both square and circular pin shapes without a change in the analytical results. It was shown that pins prepared with a maximum pressure of 95 kN cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> gave the best accuracy. New and more accurate relative sensitivity factors were obtained by synthetic pressed pins and, fortunately, these were relatively easy to prepare. This is especially important given the limited variety of CRMs and the time required for the production of a single CRM. The same powder sample preparation method was used by both groups as described by Matschat <span class="italic">et al.</span> (R. Matschat, J. Hinrichs, and H. Kipphardt, <span class="italic">Anal. Bioanal. Chem.</span>, 2006, <span class="bold">386</span>, 125–141). It would appear that differences in the sample introduction processes might explain how the two different conclusions were obtained. In the case of GD-MS, a larger surface area of the pin was sampled which averaged out small inhomogeneities within the material. However, the sampling area by LA is much smaller and subtle differences in analyte distribution and form could be revealed. In addition, sputtering erosion is a more gentle method of sampling than multiple laser shots. Therefore sputter sampling rate would be less affected by weaker adhesion between copper particles than was observed in laser sampling.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Compernolle <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> used a <span class="italic">pulsed rf GD-TOF-MS</span> instrument to determine Ag, Au, Pd, Pt and Rh in lead fire assay buttons. The concentration range covered was between 5 and 100 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and calibration was achieved using lead buttons that contained known concentrations of each element. Accuracy was assessed (&lt;5% bias), RSD values of &lt;5% were determined at 10 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<span class="italic">n</span> = 3) and LOD varied from 0.020 to 0.080 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Ag and Pt, respectively).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> used a MC ICP-MS instrument with a collision cell to measure the <span class="italic">isotopic composition and atomic weight of Se</span>.

The new atomic weight of selenium was calculated to be 78.9711<small><sub>(9)</sub></small> g mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A high throughput micro-<span class="italic">electrochemical cell was coupled</span> with ICP-MS by Klemm <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> for online trace element determination. The authors claimed the apparatus provided information on the valence state of dissolved elements (which can vary with the electrolyte and applied current density), corrosion rate, and the dissolution of native oxides. Hoshi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> described the dissolution of platinum–M alloys (where M = cobalt, copper, iron or nickel) in an electrochemical cell in 0.5 M H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> at 25 °C and analysed the digests on-line using ICP-MS. The dissolution of M atoms occurs immediately after immersion but was quickly suppressed because the surface becomes Pt rich. This was reversed by potentiostatic polarization at 1.4 V and was enhanced with potential cycling.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">oxidation of modified nickel</span>–<span class="italic">aluminium intermetallic compounds</span> implanted, separately, with yttrium and chromium at 1473 K was studied by Jedlinski <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> The oxidation experiment involved exposure to <small><sup>18</sup></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> which acted as a tracer for the oxidation process.

An unmodified nickel–aluminium compound was used as an experimental control. Implanted Cr accelerated the transformation of transient aluminum oxides into stable and protective α-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>. Implanted Y slowed this process.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Many of the published papers utilizing XRF spectrometry deal with the analysis of <span class="italic">ancient artefacts or objects of art.</span> A number of the more interesting articles are noted below. Constantinescu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> employed μ-SR XRF spectrometry to measure the trace elements in gold and copper Romanian archaeological items to clarify their provenance. The elemental evidence from the gold coins (Pb, Sb, Sn and Te) indicated that the gold coins with a monogram were made from refined gold and the ones without a monogram were made from native (alluvial) Transylvanian gold. For copper and bronze samples, the elements detected (Ag, As, Co and Sb) suggested that the copper originated from Serbia or northern Bulgaria. Portable XRF and XRD spectrometers and a digital microscope were used by Abe <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> to analyse the gold material in a folding screen art piece. The XRD measurements showed a strong preferred orientation to the (100) plane which was consistent with gold leaf. The XRF measurements of a gold checkered pattern area were found to be consistent with a double layer of gold leaf. It was not similar to a reference sample of painted gold and the overall conclusion was that the gold material was produced by gold leaf.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The techniques of synchrotron μ-beam <span class="italic">XRF spectrometry</span> and neutron μ-beam techniques were combined by Grolimund <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> to give a two dimensional (2D) chemical and crystallographic image of an early Bronze Age flanged axe found in central Europe. The internal structural details provided useful information concerning the manufacturing methods and material properties. Although the axe appeared to look similar to Greek artifacts, the spectroscopic evidence suggested that there was more influence of central European cultures than was previously believed.

        <span>This was a busy area of research in this review period. A sizeable proportion of the papers published used continuum source AAS as a means of detection. Although there is a general trend of increased usage of such instrumentation, the increase in use for the analysis of fuels appears to be far greater than for many other sample types.</span>

          <span>A paper by Kowalewska<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> described the determination of S in petroleum products using a <span class="italic">continuum source molecular absorption spectrometry</span> instrument. Samples were diluted in xylene and then either aspirated into an air/acetylene flame or introduced to an electrothermally heated graphite furnace. A high intensity xenon lamp was used as a radiation source and the rotational line of the C–S molecule was used for determination. The electrothermal method used a palladium and magnesium modifier which formed Pd<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>S<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> molecules. The detection systems yielded LOD of 14 ng and 18 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for ETAAS and FAAS respectively. The technique was not without its problems, with detection being dependent on the properties of the S-containing compounds present. Analysis of light petroleum products in which the S compounds are volatile proved to be extremely difficult whereas analysis of heavy oils and crude oils was successful in both flame and ETAAS modes. The analysis of CRMs and other materials for which XRF data were available demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed method.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">analyte pre-concentration</span>/<span class="italic">matrix removal</span> can be helpful when determining analytes present at very low concentration. Rahmani and Kaykhaii<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> determined methylcyclopentadienyl-manganese tricarbonyl in gasoline and water samples. The single drop micro-extraction technique described used a single drop (2.5 μL) of the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate to extract the analyte. The influence of the volume of the micro-drop, extraction time, ionic strength and volume of sample were all investigated. Detection of the analyte was achieved using ETAAS. An impressive LOD of 10 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained with an enrichment factor of 124. Precision for five replicate analyses was 4.8% RSD. Recoveries in the range 81.2–101% were obtained.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two applications have reported the determination of analytes in <span class="italic">emulsions using ETAAS</span>. In one,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> Cu, Fe and Pb determinations in detergent emulsions of naphtha were optimized. The optimization took into account the emulsification process and was undertaken using a three variable Doehlert design and a multiple response strategy. The three responses for the individual analytes were combined yielding a global response that was used as a dependent variable. Several variables of the emulsification process were optimized and these included the concentration of the HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, the concentration of Triton X-100 and/or Triton X-114 emulsifying agents and the total volume of solution. The optimized conditions for emulsification were 4 mL of sample mixed with 1 mL of 4.7% Triton X-100 in 10% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> solution. The emulsions so-formed were stable for at least 250 min and the instrument used had sufficient sensitivity to determine the the analytes in samples under investigation. Method validation was by spike/recovery experiments in which recoveries in the range 88–105%, 94–118% and 95–120% were obtained for Cu, Fe and Pb respectively. The other paper that used ETAAS for the detection of analytes was prepared by Becker <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57</span></sup></a> who compared the performance of a transversely heated filter atomizer and a commercially available transversely heated platform atomizer during the direct determination of As in petroleum condensate, gasoline and naphtha. The filter atomizer provided a reduction in the background signal and improved the sensitivity. A matrix modifier consisting of 0.1% m/v Pd, 0.3% m/v Mg and 0.05% v/v Triton X-100 was used for both atomizers. The samples were mixed with propanol and 0.1% v/v HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (in the ratio of 3.0<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>6.4<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>0.6) to form an emulsion which was then analysed directly. The characteristic masses obtained for the As were 13 pg for the filter atomizer and 28 pg for the commercial platform atomizer; but the LOD were approximately the same (1.9 and 1.8 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively). This was attributed to the increased noise associated with the filter atomizer arising from the partial blockage of the light beam from the hollow cathode lamp passing through the very narrow tube. Method validation was by spike/recovery experiments using an assortment of inorganic and organic As species. Recoveries in the range 89 to 111% were achieved. The only advantage of the filter atomizer identified in this work was that it was approximately 20% faster because of the hot injection mode that could be used.</p>

          <span>Several of the more novel applications for coal analysis have involved <span class="italic">the use of LIBS</span>. One of these is a paper by Yin <span class="italic">et al.</span> who determined the O content of coals in an air environment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit58"><sup><span class="sup_ref">58</span></sup></a> A combination of an internal standard, the temperature correction method and the use of multiple lines enabled the O content to be determined with a precision of no worse than 1.37%. Another example was the detection of multiple analytes (a mixture of 13 major and minor elements) in coal samples from Bangladesh and from Eastern India.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit59"><sup><span class="sup_ref">59</span></sup></a> The application of LIBS to the direct determination of volatile matter in coal was presented by Dong <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60</span></sup></a> Principal component regression and partial correlation were used to extract the LIBS spectral information and to construct a calibration curve relating the coal structure to the content of the volatile matter. The experimental results obtained were comparable to those obtained using standard methods, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, TGA. A final application to have used LIBS for the analysis of coals was reported by Feng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> These authors analysed 33 bituminous coal samples using LIBS but found that the spectra fluctuated, producing low quality calibrations. This was attributed to the heterogeneity of the samples and to the pyrolysis or combustion of the coal during the laser interaction process. Normalization applied generally to the entire spectrum was less efficient than normalization using segmental spectral areas. This latter method improved both the measurement accuracy and the precision. A partial least squares (PLS) model based on the dominant factor was used to determine the C content of the coal. The model was improved further by inducting non-linear relation by partially modelling the inter-element interference effect. Using these chemometric approaches, the authors managed to improve the root mean squared error of prediction from 5.52% to 4.47% whilst retaining a high squared product moment correlation coefficient (0.999).</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have reported the use of <span class="italic">continuum source AAS</span> as a means of coal analysis. Baysal and Akman used continuum source FAAS to determine S in coal samples following sample decomposition using a microwave-assisted digestion procedure.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> The S was measured using the C–S absorption band at 258.056 nm. Method validation was achieved using the analysis of CRMs and results were in agreement with certified values to within the 95% confidence level. Obtaining a linear calibration was not problematic because concomitant elements (other than C) were at sufficiently low concentration so as to cause no spectral interferences. Calibration standards were prepared in H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>. The method was described as being fast, simple, accurate and sensitive with the LOD being 0.01%. The S content of coals from around Turkey was determined and ranged from below the LOQ (0.03%) to 1.2%. The second paper to use continuum source instrumentation was by Jim and Katskov<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> who used a low resolution spectrometer equipped with CCD detector and a filter furnace atomizer to determine several analytes (Al, Cu, Fe, Mg and Mn) in coal slurries. In this filter furnace, the sample vapour was passed through heated graphite into the light beam where the absorption spectra over the range of 200 to 400 nm were recorded repeatedly. The output of the CCD detector was measured within each spectrum, the atomic absorption at each wavelength measured and corrected with respect to the linearization algorithm and integrated. Resolution was 0.3 nm. Calibration was by carbon slurry impregnated with the analytes of interest and by analytes being added to the slurries as multi-element solutions. Comparison of the two calibration techniques demonstrated that the latter was the preferred option, with 60% of the measurements lying within 10% deviation of the certified reference data. The overall conclusion was that the continuum source instrument coupled with a fast CCD detector enabled the rapid, simultaneous multi-elemental analysis over a wide range of concentration. This latter attribute also enabled analysis of coal slurries without the necessity of slurry dilution.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A four stage sequential extraction protocol to determine with which phase of the sulfur-rich coal the analytes Cd, Co and Pb are associated was reported by Scaccia and Mecozzi.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> As well as the sulfur-rich coals themselves (from Sulcis, Italy), coal chars derived at 600, 750 and at 950 °C were also analysed. The actual analysis was undertaken using <span class="italic">a slurry sampling protocol and ETAAS detection</span>. Various parameters were optimized and these included the amount of coal slurried (between 1 and 50 mg), the volume of the slurry (1–3 mL), the dispersing medium (1% Triton X-100 or 2 M HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>), the sonication time (5–30 min) and the pyrolysis and atomization temperatures. A matrix modifier of palladium nitrate was used for the Cd determination whereas ammonium dihydrogen phosphate was required to stabilize the Pb during the pyrolysis stage. The analysis of the coal for the Cd content required the use of the HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> as a dispersant because it produced a lower background signal. The coal char samples however, produced a far lower background signal and could therefore be dispersed in Triton X-100 for the determination of all of the analytes. Although Cd could be determined against acid-matched aqueous standards, the Co and Pb experienced some chemical interference effects and needed to be determined using the standard addition technique. Precision was reportedly better than 5% for all analytes (<span class="italic">n</span> = 5) at concentrations of 1, 10 and 15 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cd, Co and Pb respectively. Under optimal conditions, a 30 mg sample mass and a slurry concentration of 30% m/v yielded a LOD for Cd of 0.001 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The other analytes required different conditions (50 mg of material and 50% m/v slurry concentration), but still yielded impressive LOD (both 0.01 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). The method was validated by the analysis of the CRM BCR 182 (steam coal).</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers by Raeva <span class="italic">et al.</span> have reported a method that could measure the <span class="italic">kinetics of vaporization</span> of organically associated inorganic contaminants<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a> and inorganic matrix effects<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> during coal combustion. The procedure used an ETAAS instrument as an experimental platform for temperatures of up to 2800 °C. An assortment of analytes was tested and instrumental operating conditions such as the pyrolysis and atomization temperatures, internal gas flow as well as the effects of trace element concentration were all studied. Although the degree of analyte vaporization observed at varying pyrolysis temperatures varied significantly, the vaporization activation energies were independent of the operating conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a> The second paper used As, Sb and Se as the analytes which were introduced to the ETAAS instrument as a water soluble form using coal-relevant matrix/trace element ratios.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> This allowed a homogeneous trace element distribution within the matrix. Calcium acetate and iron(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) nitrate increased the atomization/vaporization activation energies significantly (indicating an increased retention in the solid phase) whereas sodium aluminate did not alter the activation energy. A matrix of potassium silicate decreased the activation energy for Se, reducing its atomic absorption signal. The authors attributed this to specific interactions of anionic trace elemental species with cationic matrices.</p>

          <span>Several methods have been reported for the analysis of oils. Many of these studies originated in Brazil. Sabio <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the determination of Zn in lubricating oils using an ultrasonic wave assisted acid extraction of the analyte prior to <span class="italic">FAAS detection</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a> A chemometric optimization of the process was undertaken which resulted in the optimal conditions of 1.3 mL of hydrochloric acid, 5 mL of hydrogen peroxide, 120 seconds of sonication time, heating to 60 °C and 45% sonication amplitude being obtained. The results of line-source FAAS were comparable at the 95% confidence level to those obtained using continuum source FAAS. Spike/recovery tests yielded data in the range 92–119%. The same research group, at Araraquara, used continuum source FAAS with a nitrous oxide/acetylene flame to determine Si in lubricating oils.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> Samples were digested using H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and a least squares background correction system eliminated spectral interferences caused by the molecular C–S band at 251.602 nm. An internal standardization procedure using tungsten helped overcome transport effects. Other candidates for the internal standard (aluminium, barium, titanium and vanadium) were also tested. Silicon in the range 0.5–5 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> against 25 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> W yielded linear response. Using both least squares background correction and internal standardization enabled a precision of 1.9% RSD (<span class="italic">n</span> = 12) to be obtained. A spike concentration of 2 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> yielded a recovery of 72.5–82.5% rising to 94.0–99.0 % when both background correction and internal standardization were used.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy</span> (LIBS) was used by Elnasharty <span class="italic">et al.</span> to monitor lubricating oil to ensure that it does not lose its lubricating properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69</span></sup></a> The cyanide and carbon (Swan bands) molecular emission lines were used during the monitoring process and could be related to the oil degradation as a function of mileage. The percentage decay of the CN and C<small><sub>2</sub></small> signal intensities increased gradually with increasing mileage. The authors concluded that the method they had developed was a simple, straightforward, direct and rapid means of testing the oil to prevent engine failure.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several papers have been published that have reported the use of <span class="italic">plasma-based instrumentation for the analysis of oils</span>. In one application, volatile Ni and V compounds were determined in crude oil and its fractions using GC-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> The transfer line between the GC column and the injector to the torch had to be heated to at least 350 °C to prevent condensation (loss) of the analytes prior to atomization. Similarly, transfer had to be achieved using heated argon gas. The Ni and V porphyrin distributions in different oils were determined enabling a finger-printing method to be obtained. Another ICP-MS-based paper was prepared by Bettmer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit71"><sup><span class="sup_ref">71</span></sup></a> These authors reported the accurate and precise measurement of several analytes (Mo, Ni, Pb and Sn) using direct micro-flow injection isotope dilution. Solutions of <small><sup>97</sup></small>Mo, <small><sup>62</sup></small>Ni, <small><sup>206</sup></small>Pb and <small><sup>117</sup></small>Sn in organic solvents were spiked into diluted oil samples and analysed directly. Although strong matrix effects affected the ICP-MS sensitivity, the isotope ratio measurements were unaffected, meaning that the results obtained were accurate. Precision was approximately 15% for peak area and peak height measurements, but this improved to approximately 2% when the isotope dilution method was used. Method validation was obtained by analysing the NIST standard reference material SRM 1084a (wear metals in lubricating oils); with results agreeing with certified values within the range 98–102%. An interesting method of trace elemental determination in diesel oil was presented by Cassella <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> These authors emulsified the sample with a surfactant (Triton X-114) in acid solution and then broke the emulsion using centrifugation. The result was an organic layer containing the bulk sample and the surfactant and the acidic aqueous layer containing the trace elements. This aqueous layer was then diluted, an internal standard added and analysed using ICP-MS. Parameters such as the concentration of the HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, the Triton X-114, extraction and collection times and the calibration strategy were all optimized. Limits of detection for the analytes Al, Cu, Mn, Ni, Sn and V were in the range 26–88 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the method was validated using spike/recovery experiments, with recoveries in the range 88–113% being obtained. De Souza <span class="italic">et al.</span> determined several (12) analytes in lubricant oil, residual fuel oil and biodiesel using ICP-OES as a means of detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> Samples were diluted using xylene and then an evaluation of two different μ-nebulizer types, the PFA-100 and Miramist, was undertaken. The operational conditions were optimized using factorial design. Both nebulizer types produced similar LOD (between 0.3 and 18 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Mg and Ni respectively), but the PFA-100 nebulizer produced a greater sensitivity. Analysis of the NIST reference materials SRM 1643c and SRM 1085b demonstrated the accuracy of the procedure, with results of between 93% (for Pb) and 102% (for P) for the PFA-100 and 90% (for Pb) and 103% (for P) for the Miramist relative to certified values being obtained. Spiking experiments were also undertaken and yielded recovery data in the range 89–103%.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">One of the official methods of determining <span class="italic">Cl in oils</span> is the US EPA 9075, which uses EDXRF to determine Cl over the concentration range 200 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to percentage levels.

          <span id="sect803"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.1.4. Alternative fuels. </span>
          <span>Several strategies have been developed for measuring trace elements in alternative fuels. Many of these have involved emulsification of the sample or simple dilution in alcohol. The <span class="italic">formation of micro-emulsions</span> was used as a means of sample introduction to ICP-OES during the determination of S in biodiesel.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> The sample (2–3 mL) was mixed with 20% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (0.5 mL) and Triton X-100 (0.5 mL) and then diluted using <span class="italic">n</span>-propanol to a volume of 10 mL. This was then aspirated into the ICP-OES instrument and the emission from a number of S lines was summed. This enabled an improvement in accuracy and sensitivity to be obtained. Recoveries were variable and were typically in the range 72–119%, with the recovery at the 182.562 nm line being even lower. The authors attributed the poor performance of this line to its lack of sensitivity. A similar sample preparation procedure was developed for sample introduction to a FAAS instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> In this example, the analytes of interest were Ca, Mg and Zn. External calibration was used employing inorganic standards and light mineral oil. Precision (<span class="italic">n</span> = 10) was 4.0, 2.2 and 5.7% for Ca, Mg and Zn respectively and no matrix effects were reported when external calibration was compared with standard additions. Method validation was achieved using spike/recovery experiments and the recoveries were in the range 90.8 to 115%. The method developed was applied to the analysis of several biodiesel types, including African oil palm, castor beans, palm and soybeans.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Dilution of the biodiesel samples with an alcohol</span> was used as a means of sample preparation by two research groups. A paper by Chaves <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the use of an ICP-OES instrument with a Paschen-Runge spectrometer equipped with CCD detectors for the determination of the analytes Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, S and Zn in samples of biodiesel diluted with either ethanol or propanol.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77</span></sup></a> The sample introduction system (a cyclonic spray chamber) was cooled to −5 °C to decrease the amount of organic solvent entering the plasma. As well as increasing the stability of the plasma, this also decreased the spectral interferences originating from carbon compounds. The use of propanol for sample dilution was preferable to ethanol because it could be used for both biodiesel and vegetable oils, whereas the ethanol could be used for the biodiesel only. In addition, the propanol would have a lower vapour pressure, again leading to a decrease in the amount of solvent entering the plasma. Calibration of the system was achieved using inorganic standards diluted in either ethanol or propanol. Internal standardization using Y was used to increase precision and accuracy. The instrument, which could detect wavelengths over the range 130–770 nm, was also fitted with a background correction system that was capable of overcoming any remaining carbon-containing interferences. The accuracy of the method developed was demonstrated by the successful analysis of the NIST biodiesel reference materials SRM 2772 and SRM 2773. Recoveries were reportedly in the range of 87–116% for the biodiesel and 95–106% for the vegetable oils. Precision (<span class="italic">n</span> = 3) was typically better than 5% and LOD were at the μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level. A similar sample preparation protocol was used in a paper by Quadros <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> who determined Al, Cu, Fe and Mn in biodiesel samples diluted in ethanol. In this application, the detection of the analytes was achieved by using continuum source ETAAS. All analytes except Al could be determined without the need for a matrix modifier and with aqueous calibration standards. The Al required the use of a zirconium-treated tube as a permanent modifier and standardization using ethanol rather than water. The accuracy of the procedure was checked using spike/recovery experiments (with recovery values of 90–108% being achieved). Precision was typically better than 7% and LOD at the ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range were obtained for all analytes.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A procedure for the <span class="italic">direct analysis of biodiesel samples</span> was reported in a paper by de Campos <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> A continuum source ETAAS instrument was used for the determination of P in the samples. Chemometric optimization of the procedure was undertaken, with the atomization temperature and matrix modifier composition proving to be the most important factors. A mixed modifier of palladium and magnesium nitrate (30 and 20 μg respectively) along with pyrolysis and atomization temperatures of 1000 and 2700 °C were optimal. Another very important parameter was the drying stage, which had to be extremely slow to obtain good reproducibility. The authors therefore developed a five stage drying process. Calibration was against organic P standards diluted in P-free biodiesel. A LOD of 0.5 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained and participation in an inter-laboratory comparison exercise yielded results in good agreement with those expected.</p>

        <h3 id="sect827"><span class="b_heading">2.2. Organic chemicals and solvents</span></h3>
        <span>Several areas of research have been very active over this review period and this paragraph is a <span class="italic">summary of the highlights</span>. The active areas include the analysis of valuable art and historical objects, which is very challenging and is a major user and, increasingly, a driver of developments in advanced analytical technology, as evidenced by the large number of papers dealing with this field. Also of note during this review period is the increased use of combined analytical techniques, making good use of both atomic and molecular information, together with spatial resolution. For example Cotte <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> described coupling WDXRF and SR sources, to assist with the drive for more spectral and spatial resolution. This is reviewed in more detail in Section 2.2.1. The use of data processing techniques to improve the quality and reliability of LIBS measurements is a significant feature of several papers although matrix effects and interferences remain significant. One very interesting advance is the development of optical catapulting as a means of removing the sample from the matrix, thereby eliminating substrate effects from the LIBS data. These developments are also reviewed in detail, in Section 2.2.2. Speciation of elements and an understanding of the molecular form of analytes features in a significant number of papers. The use of continuum source AAS for the determination of molecular P in fertilizers is a significant development and is reviewed in some detail. This reviewer predicts that this technique will be very beneficial in Africa and other developing regions where argon is expensive and scarce, thus making analysis using ICP less attractive. Phosphate determination is also of interest in African countries where phosphate availability for agriculture is becoming a problem. Other highlights in this year's literature include the increased use of high temperature liquid chromatography which requires less organic modifiers and therefore makes ICP and ESI-MS detection easier as well as ‘greening’ the analysis by minimizing organic solvent usage. A number of interesting extraction and sample introduction initiatives have been reported, including slurry nebulization with continuum source AAS detection. Finally, a TXRF procedure was developed for the determination of residual metals in active pharmaceutical ingredients, and this technique is likely to grow significantly in the near future. These developments are reviewed in more detail below and a small number of papers have been included in a table to compliment some of the work which was reviewed in more depth.</span>

          <span id="sect834"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.2.1. The analysis of archaeological and art objects. </span>
          <span>The production of <span class="italic">elemental maps or imaging of historical paintings</span> is important in the analysis of high-value art objects as this information enables the investigation of pigment or image changes during or after its creation, usually by degradation through ageing. The identification of pigments and understanding the nature of their degradation products is therefore critical for the understanding of how to improve conservation procedures. This analysis is often difficult but is useful to be able to correlate the colour of the paint layer with the state of conservation of the pigment species. A number of important papers in this review period have started to address this issue, often using both atomic and molecular techniques and micro-analytical procedures including optical and electron microscopies. Developments in portable instrumentation for <span class="italic">in situ</span> measurements are also important.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81–83</span></sup></a> In an example of pigment analysis used in conservation studies, mercury sulfide–cinnabar in its natural form or vermillion red when synthetic—was frequently used in frescoes and paintings, and is known to suffer from degradation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84</span></sup></a> The characterization of the degradation products is important in preservation studies but is very challenging because of the micron scale and heterogeneity of the surface layers that form on degradation. Traditionally, techniques including SEM, synchrotron based X-ray techniques and SIMS have been employed. In this novel and very relevant paper, the use of μ-XRD (with both laboratory and synchrotron radiation sources) to analyse and image red HgS pigment and its degradation products in degraded paint layers was reported. This XRD analysis was critical in confirming the presence of the specific HgS compounds including calomel (Hg<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>), corderoite and kenhsuite (both forms of Hg<small><sub>3</sub></small>S<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>). Elemental analytical techniques such as SEM-EDAX and XRF were used to confirm the presence of Cl and S. This information is likely to be useful in understanding the best means of preserving these images and it is likely that technology driven by this application area will be useful in other fields including catalysis. Similarly, TOF-SIMS was reported by Richardin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> for the imaging of paintings and the identification of various copper pigments and their degradation products with simultaneous identification of organic components. The distribution of these species with micron spatial resolution was achieved and the non-destructive nature of the technique has also been employed in the analysis of cultural heritage objects.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">In some cases, the analysis of <span class="italic">protrusions or areas of damage</span> is required to enable an understanding of the mechanisms of degradation with time and thereby implement new conservation strategies. Often, these protrusions are blisters or crater like holes and in Max Beckman's Pierrette and Clown these blisters and holes are filled with metallic soap aggregates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> This paper illustrates both the importance of spatial resolution in understanding the nature of these defects and the benefits of SR sources in providing sufficient resolution. In this case, confocal SR μ-XRF spectrometry enabled both compositional and spatial distribution of the blister's components to be studied. This paper also demonstrated the benefit of molecular analysis used in conjunction with atomic techniques and Raman spectroscopy found fatty acid derivatives and lithopone-base white pigments. Similarly, a combination of techniques and various data processing approaches for the studies of pigments was demonstrated by Donais <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> Here, a fusion of high voltage XRF data and Raman data enabled improved differentiation of a range of pigments.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There are many <span class="italic">parallels between the analysis of historical objects and forensic samples</span>. In one such case,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89</span></sup></a> a bench top confocal μ-XRF instrument was employed for the depth-profiling of forensic samples, including multi-layered automotive paints and leather samples. Some heterogeneity of results was confirmed by conventional cross-sectional μ-XRF analysis, thus giving validity to the technique. In an unusual approach to the spatial determination of elements, LIPS and 3D digital microscopy were applied to encrusted stone and copper alloy sculptures and wall paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit90"><sup><span class="sup_ref">90</span></sup></a> Emphasis of this paper was on the use of combined methodology for the characterization of archaeological artefacts. Near IR luminescence is a rarely used technique and has recently been reported by Thoury <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> for the <span class="italic">in situ</span> determination and elemental mapping of Cd pigments in paintings. The authors described a detailed study of the luminescence properties of Cd pigments and showed that the band edge luminescence in the visible and the deep trap luminescence in the red and infrared regions could be used successfully to assign pigment types including cadmium sulfide, cadmium zinc sulfide and cadmium sulfoselenide.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The determination of the <span class="italic">speciation of Cr in paints</span> using XANES was reported by Zanella <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> Changes on exposure to light and various chemicals implicated in environmental exposure, including sulfur dioxide and humidity, were determined in order to study the alteration of the chromate pigment zinc yellow under the above environmental conditions. Degradation was due to reduction of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>. Environmental SEM and confocal SR μ-XRF spectrometry were employed to obtain compositional and spatial information on the components. Analysis of closed blisters showed a high concentration of Zn in the centre with surrounding layers of Ba and Sr. Organic composition and pigments from flakes from open blisters were determined using Raman spectroscopy. In some cases this analysis revealed images of discarded paintings which were over-painted. Use of XANES in conjunction with ICP-OES and SEM-EDAX was employed for the evaluation of phytate chelating treatments on manuscripts which had been damaged by the corrosive effects of iron gall inks.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> This chelation treatment can be used to stabilize damaged manuscripts and art works by inhibiting the oxidative action of the iron. Various side effects of this treatment include changes in iron oxidation states, elemental losses and deposits. The associated mechanisms were evaluated using Fe-K-edge XANES. This paper described in detail the experimental conditions employed to record the XANES spectra and results showed the determination of Fe(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)/Fe(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) ratios with an uncertainty of ±5% absolute. The removal of Fe by the alteration of Fe(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)/Fe(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) ratios by the treatment was discussed. The degradation of Prussian blue pigments is an important parameter in preservation work and this was investigated by accelerated aging and combined molecular and atomic analysis. The techniques of UV-VIS spectroscopy, ATR-IR spectroscopy, Fe K-edge X-ray absorption and <small><sup>57</sup></small>Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy were employed by Samain <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> Changes in Fe coordination number and oxidation state were confirmed.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As discussed previously, <span class="italic">elemental mapping</span> is of critical importance and until recently, technology to record elemental maps based upon the rapid and non-destructive measurement of a broad range of elements was rather limited. The development and improvement of three self-built, scanning, macro-XRF instruments which have addressed this issue to some extent was described by Alfield <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> each instrument being improved using experience gained from the construction of its predecessor. Detection limits were discussed and the use of poly-capillary optics and pinhole collimators were employed to define the beam. In a further example of the usefulness of non-destructive or micro-destructive analysis of culturally important artefacts, a handheld XRF analyser was employed for preliminary analysis of elemental composition prior to more extensive and targeted analysis using SEM-EDAX and FTIR spectroscopy,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> thereby minimizing sample requirements and damage.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The advantages of <span class="italic">synchrotron spectroscopies</span> including 2D and 3D micro-imaging capabilities are becoming widely utilized in chemical analyses.

          <span id="sect893"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.2.2. Applications of LIBS, laser and plasma techniques. </span>
          <span>The <span class="italic">technique of LIBS</span> is becoming widely reported for the real time analysis of a wide range of materials since it requires little or no sample preparation. The capability for rapid and remote acquisition of analytical data makes LIBS a very desirable technique in several applications and many papers outline its use, for example in the analysis of explosives and other hazardous materials. In a new application area, the effectiveness of LIBS in process analytical chemistry was demonstrated for determining the composition of pharmaceutical tablets based on specific inorganic atoms in addition to C, H and O.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit104"><sup><span class="sup_ref">104</span></sup></a> The speed and remote capabilities, together with the high specificity of the technique were particularly beneficial in this application. As with many LIBS applications, the use of chemometrics was key to the success of the analysis and PCA and SIMCA were employed to classify pharmaceutical tablets. It is likely that as the body of evidence demonstrating its advantages in this kind of analysis leads to confidence in the technique, LIBS will become more frequently used for quality control and process analysis, although there are still issues (real and perceived) associated with making this technique sufficiently quantitative and reliable.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Coupling LIBS with multivariate analysis</span> of the data is a successful strategy for both qualitative and quantitative analysis.

These attributes make it an ideal technique for materials analysis and characterization. A further review paper, by Nevin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit106"><sup><span class="sup_ref">106</span></sup></a> containing 178 references and concentrating specifically on the use of laser spectroscopies for the elemental and molecular analysis of art and archaeological objects, may be useful for the interested reader. In this review, methods were classified according to elemental analysis technique, including LIBS, LA-ICP-MS and molecular analysis, including LIF, LIDAR, time resolved absorption and laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Imaging applications were included as were application of THz and non-linear spectroscopy together with combinations of techniques.

            <span class="italic">Optical catapulting in combination with LIBS</span> is an interesting developing technique with potential for rapid and highly selective analysis of a range of materials on various substrates. It was employed recently for the analysis of explosive residues in human fingerprints by Abdelhamid <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> Optical catapulting works by ejecting particles from the sample using an acoustic pulse or pressure wave generated by a laser beam transmitted along the sample. The particles or aerosol liberated from the substrate are then free from interferences from the substrate when subsequently analysed using LIBS. The experimental conditions including acquisition delay, distance from the analytical surface and interpulse delay were studied and optimized for the analysis of trinitrotoluene residues and related explosive molecules in the presence of a range of potentially interfering species. This technique was able to provide chemical images thereby giving visual information on the spatial distribution of explosive residues within fingerprints.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">influence of the substrate</span> is an area of extensive study in LIBS and methods other than optical catapulting have also been developed. Several potential biological and chemical threat simulant residues were prepared on multiple substrates in the presence of various interferents.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> Biological threats which were explored included <span class="italic">Bacillus atrophaeus</span> spores, <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>, MS-2 bacteriophage and α-hemolysin from <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>. Chemical residues included 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide and dimethyl methylphosphonate. The presence of various substrates has traditionally presented a challenge for the successful determination of analytes using LIBS. In this case, this was addressed by preparing residue samples on various substrates including polycarbonate, stainless steel and aluminium foil and spectra of the blank substrates were measured. The chemometric deconvolution of the LIBS spectra was by PLS-DA with inclusion of the full LIBS spectra including the spectral contribution from the substrate. Perhaps not surprisingly, the LIBS spectrum from the stainless steel substrate was quite complex. Some analytes were quite opaque to the wavelength of the laser (1064 nm) and were not subject to significant interference from the substrate, others were transparent and this resulted in significant substrate emission. The authors described the development of appropriate chemometric models and a useful flowchart for the development and testing of PLS-DA models to discriminate residues on multiple substrates in the presence of various interferents was presented. This approach was compared with the use of selected emission line intensities and ratios. The inclusion of the full analyte and substrate spectra generally resulted in better classification performance and 98.9% correct classification was achieved on an aluminium substrate, up to 85.5% on a steel substrate and up to 85.6% on polycarbonate, although the success rate did vary according to the model used. The use of the intensity/ratio models was more successful in identifying more residue types in the presence of interferents. Substrates not included in the model were likely to result in error but this was minimized by the analysis of swabbed material. It was also demonstrated that in addition to the identification of the major components of the residue mixtures, minor components including growth media and solvents were identifiable with an appropriately designed chemometric model. This work represents a significant advance in the use of LIBS for this kind of analysis, with this approach resulting in a significant improvement in classification performance for models built using multiple substrates.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In a different approach to the discrimination of organic molecules on substrates, the kinetics of the emission decay and reactions leading to the formation of emitting molecules were used to build <span class="italic">a model which discriminated molecular and atomic emission lines</span> successfully.

Detection of Al, Cu and Si was demonstrated. This technique was not capable of remote analysis and required the destruction of the sample, creating a 1 mm diameter hole, so is not suitable for explosives analysis or the analysis of valuable artefacts, but may be useful as a cheap and quick technique for the analysis of low value, low hazard materials.</p>

Monitoring Br, Cl and Pt emission lines enabled the ligand to metal mole ratios to be determined for all the separated species. The experimental molar ratios agreed well with the calculated values for authentic standards and mM LOD were achieved. These relatively high LOD are likely to be because of the low emission intensities of the halides.

This approach gave a unique fingerprint to the tagged product and its authentication can be ascertained by comparing the ratio of the mole fractions as determined experimentally (in this case by ICP-MS) with the known ratios of the added tag. The advantage of this procedure is that it relies on isotope abundances and molar fraction ratios of the tag, rather than classical isotope ratios. The mole fraction ratio is not affected by any physical, chemical or biochemical processes which the sample may undergo, nor is it affected by environmental contamination with elements containing natural isotopic abundance. These factors can create problems with single isotope spike experiments. Additionally, the use of mole fraction ratios overcomes any issues of inhomogeneity of the tag.

Precision expressed as % RSD was between 0.5 and 3 for both analytes in real samples. In another example of the use of ultrasound, several heavy metals were extracted from herbarium mount paper in museum pieces, to address health concerns about handling materials impregnated with toxic metals used as biocides.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> This paper described what is possibly the first example of the use of ultrasound extraction of As, Ba and Hg from contaminated paper, together with vapour generation and AFS for their quantitation. The FI based solvent recirculation system enables solvent into which ultrasound energy is coupled to pass over the sample. The optimization of this system was described, together with the optimization of the vapour generation stage. Recoveries of all the elements in spiked paper samples were between 87 and 93%, which is excellent in view of the volatility of the analyte elements. The authors are to be commended for quoting realistic working linear ranges for this analysis based on the analysis of actual samples rather than quoting the theoretical linear range of atomic fluorescence. The linear ranges for As, Hg and Ba were 10–100 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 1–100 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 125–1000 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively.

          <p class="otherpara">In many analyses, the <span class="italic">volatility of the analytes can be problematic</span>.

This procedure employed thioacetamide to convert volatile Pd compounds into their non-volatile thioacetamide complexes and this completely eliminated volatility errors regardless of the species of Pd present. Microwave induced combustion is a useful means of eliminating the matrices altogether, prior to the determination of volatile analytes. The analytes Br and Cl were determined in cigarettes by using this technique, followed by ICP-OES detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> The technique resulted in residual carbon of less than 1% and the analysis of CRMs yielded data that were in 98% agreement with certified values.

          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">analysis of untreated sample matrices by plasma techniques can often result in significant errors</span> because of matrix effects and great care is needed if erroneous results are to be avoided. A number of studies showed that the concentration of carbon, in its various forms within a sample, can significantly affect the emission intensities of various spectral lines, and impact the robustness of the analysis. These effects can arise by influencing aerosol formation and transport properties within the sample introduction system. Matrix matching is a recognized technique for eliminating these issues but is often not possible if the matrix is not fully characterized. Standard addition calibration can be time-consuming and difficult when sample availability is limited. Internal standardization is a well tried and common technique for the minimization of matrix effects. In an important and timely recent study by Vogiatzis and Zachariadis,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> Y and Be were evaluated as internal standard elements during ICP-OES analyses. The work in this paper demonstrated that the matrix can and often does lead to large errors in analysis. This was demonstrated with 19 elements in matrices containing various organic compounds including dioxane, formic acid, glucose and sucrose at up to 50% concentration. Conventional nebulizers and spray chambers and no organic removal techniques were employed. The influence of the matrices was examined by measuring the changes in sensitivity of the calibration curves. Matrices containing 2% dioxane and 50% sucrose caused the largest changes in sensitivity. In most cases the use of internal standardization rectified the linearity of the calibration curves and beryllium was more effective that yttrium in correcting for changes in the emission intensities of many atomic lines. This work demonstrated the need for care and a good understanding of matrix effects and how to correct for them, when using matrices containing varying concentrations of organic compounds.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The very thorough development of a <span class="italic">slurry introduction technique with continuum source ETAAS detection</span> for the determination of Cd as a toxic impurity in fertilizer was presented by Borges <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> Here, the requirement for conventional acid digestion was eliminated by employing direct analysis using slurry introduction into ETAAS. The use of CCD array detection and the continuum source instrumentation removed several limitations of solids analysis that arose through spectral interferences usually associated with conventional line sources. The use of both a mixed Pd–Mg modifier (10 and 6 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively) and an Ir permanent modifier (400 μg) were studied under various pyrolysis temperatures. The optimal pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were 600 °C and 1600 °C for the mixed modifier and 500 °C and 1600 °C for the permanent modifier. The particle size of the slurry was controlled by passing it through a 45 μm sieve to improve precision of the analysis. The larger, discarded particles were shown not to contain detectable Cd after the sample preparation stage and so it was valid to discard this portion of the sample. The results obtained from the analysis of the NIST reference material SRM 695 were statistically valid when either the Pd–Mg or the Ir modifier was used. However, perhaps surprisingly, the recovery of Cd from the real fertilizer samples was reduced significantly when using the iridium modifier compared with the Pd–Mg modifier. This emphasizes the requirement that recovery studies must be carried out on real samples and that good agreement for a CRM does not necessarily translate into accurate results with real samples. Recovery of Cd when conventional acid digestion was used was significantly lower than for the new slurry procedure, demonstrating losses of volatile analyte species. Ultrasonic slurry sampling for the determination of trace levels of a range of metals in drug tablets by ETV-ICP-MS was described by Lin and Jiang.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> As with the above paper, the optimization of modifiers as well as pyrolysis vaporization temperatures resulted in a procedure requiring minimal sample preparation and reduced loss of volatile elements as compared with conventional acid digestion procedures.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">technique of TXRF</span> is potentially useful for metals determination because it is virtually unaffected by matrix effects, is very sensitive, with ppb level LOD being achieved regularly, and can require little sample preparation. In work by Antosz <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> which may reduce the need for sample digestion in pharmaceutical analysis, TXRF was used for the quantitation of residual metals in active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates. Advantages compared with the more widely used technique of FAAS include its rapidity and multi-element capabilities and generally lower LOD. Compared with ICP-OES, the major advantages are the reduced need for acid digestions during sample preparation (solid samples can be analyzed directly) and low sample amounts required. These advantages, coupled with the very significant reduction in the matrix effects commonly seen with conventional XRF spectrometry make this an ideal technique for trace multi-element determination in a range of application areas. The technique is likely to receive increased attention for quantitative analysis of a range of samples. One caveat, however, is the need for careful application of the sample onto the sample carrier, although errors associated with sample application can be minimized by the use of a suitable internal standard. In this case, Ga was employed. Excellent linearity for a range of elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Ni, Pd and Sr) was demonstrated in a standard mixture, corresponding to 10–5000 ppm in the sample although the paper does not say whether this was achievable in a real sample. Recoveries of most of the metals at 0.1 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> within the active pharmaceutical ingredient was between 87.8% and 135.3%, with the exception of Al which was much poorer. This was attributed to its low sensitivity. Results for Pd and Cu in 14 different ingredients were compared with those obtained using ICP-MS following acid digestion. Statistical analysis showed that there were no differences (95% confidence). Potential interference with the Pd determination by chlorine was noted but was minimized by using a tungsten instead of a molybdenum cathode. In an interesting development, the use of confocal μ-XRF spectrometry was employed for the chemical imaging of Cu, Fe, Mn, Ti, and Zn within pharmaceutical preparations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> Matrix absorption effects were important and required correction and the paper showed the determination of the 2D and 3D distribution of a range of elements, to a depth of several hundred microns.</p>

          <span>The analysis of this material type was split into two main areas of research: those that are based on LIBS (the majority) and those that are X-ray based.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Analysis using LIBS</span> was reported in a series of papers by Gondal <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136–138</span></sup></a> In the first of these applications, LIBS was used to determine S in reinforced concrete.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> The presence of S in concrete is known to cause severe structural damage with time and so its determination is of utmost importance. However, S has poor sensitivity using most techniques so a dual pulse LIBS system was devised to improve the sensitivity and LOD. Two lasers were used, one operating at 1064 nm (a standard Nd:YAG) and the other at 266 nm (the fourth harmonic of the same type). Sample was ablated by the laser operating at 266 nm (at 500 mJ pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and then the other laser was used to excite the plume of vapour (at 50 mJ pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). The repetition rate was 10 Hz. The singly charged S line at 545.38 nm was used for the determination. Since a charged species was being detected, careful optimization of the time delay between the laser pulses and before the spectrograph that employed a gated intensified CCD detector was necessary to ensure that maximum signal was obtained. Once optimal time delays had been determined, a LOD of 38 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained. Inspection of the calibration graph produced gave a correlation coefficient of 0.986, but there appeared to be distinct curvature at higher levels. Despite this, there was sufficient linearity and sufficient sensitivity for the method developed to be regarded as successful. The other two applications in this series described the LIBS determination of Cl in reinforced concrete.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">138137</span></sup></a> In the first of these papers, a single pulse LIBS system was employed, whereas the latter used a similar dual pulse LIBS setup to that described previously. In these cases, the Cl was monitored at 837.5 nm and at 594.8 nm (both atomic lines). The dual pulse LIBS system improved the sensitivity obtained at both lines. However, despite the latter wavelength having approximately 1000<small><sup>th</sup></small> the intensity of the former, it was the preferred line because it exhibited less self-absorption. The other paper used a single pulse LIBS system. A fourth LIBS system was described by Westlake <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">139</span></sup></a> These authors used several techniques (LIBS, Raman micro-spectroscopy and XRD) to investigate pigments on painted plaster in Minoan, Roman and early Byzantine Crete.

          <span>The use of novel matrix modifiers has traditionally been placed in this section of the review. There have been several types of modifier used in this review period and these will be discussed over the next few paragraphs.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Several research groups have used <span class="italic">nanoparticles as matrix modifiers.</span> Palladium nanoparticles have been used in two papers. In one, by Yi <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> they were used as a modifier to stabilize As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb and Zn in slurries of biological samples prior to analysis using ultrasonic slurry sampling ETV-ICP-MS. Both the instrumental conditions and the preparation of the slurries were optimized. For the slurry preparation, 1 g of &lt;150 μm material was mixed with water to a volume of 10 mL. Then, 1 mL of this was transferred to another 10 mL flask and, since standard addition was used as the calibration method, it was at this stage that known concentrations of analytes were added. The slurry was then sonicated for 5 min and aliquots (1 mL) removed for analysis whilst the slurry was being vortex mixed. Compared with the standard method of introducing the palladium as an aqueous solution, 100 ng of nanoparticles produced better signals for the analytes; with factors of improvement ranging from about one (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, virtually no change) for Cd through to about 10 for Pb. Analysis of the NIST reference materials SRM 1568a (rice flour) and SRM 1573a (tomato leaves) yielded data in good agreement with certified values. The data from the “real” samples were compared with those obtained using an acid dissolution followed by introduction through pneumatic nebulization. These were also in agreement. Another paper to have used palladium nanoparticles as a matrix modifier (this time used in conjunction with the permanent modifier ruthenium) was prepared by Resano and Florez,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> who determined S in an assortment of solid samples using continuum source graphite furnace molecular absorption spectrometry. No sample pre-treatment was necessary. The sample was simply cut with a ceramic knife and placed on a platform that had been pre-treated with the ruthenium modifier. The palladium nanoparticles were added and the platform transferred to the graphite furnace. Calibration was achieved using aqueous standards (10 μL) mixed with the palladium nanoparticles (40 μg). The analyte was determined as the C–S molecule at 257.958 nm. The nanoparticles were a more efficient method of thermally stabilizing all of the S-containing species analysed when compared with a conventional palladium solution that was capable of stabilizing non-volatile inorganic species such (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> sodium sulfate) but had a much poorer efficiency with organic species such as thiourea. Numerous materials were analysed using the procedure developed, including biological samples, petroleum coke, polyethylene and steel CRMs. The LOD was 9 ng and the characteristic mass 14 ng, but these values could be improved to 3 ng for both by combining data from the main six C–S lines. Gunduz <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">144</span></sup></a> used gold nanoparticles to thermally stabilize the analytes As and Sb up to a temperature of 1100 °C during conventional ETAAS analysis of salt solutions. The optimal amount of modifier was identified and the protocol developed was validated using certified materials and spiked seawater samples. Precision was better than 10% RSD and the LOD for the analysis of seawater were 2.3 and 3.0 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As and Sb, respectively.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several applications of <span class="italic">permanent matrix modifiers</span> have been published. A paper by da Silva <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145</span></sup></a> described the determination of Cd in rice using ETAAS with an aluminium permanent modifier. Samples were digested using HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> in a digester block. A full two level factorial design was used to optimize the operating conditions and led to the following conditions being used: aluminium mass of 400 μg, pyrolyis temperature of 400 °C and a time of 20 s and an atomization temperature of 1800 °C. Calibration could be achieved using aqueous standards. Under optimal conditions, the LOD was 2 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, characteristic mass was 1.3 pg and precision (at a concentration of 41.3 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) was 1.67% RSD. The method was validated using a Japanese rice flour CRM. Ferreira <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit146"><sup><span class="sup_ref">146</span></sup></a> also used aluminium as a permanent modifier; this time during the determination of Pb in sugar cane spirits. Optimal conditions were: pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, pyrolysis time of 20 s, atomization temperature of 1800 °C and an aluminium mass of 3 μg. Calibration could again be achieved using aqueous standards and the optimal conditions yielded a LOD of 0.14 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a characteristic mass of 24 pg. Since no CRM for sugar cane spirits exists, the authors resorted to validating the method using an orchard leaves reference material. Further validation was achieved by comparing the data obtained using the proposed method with those obtained using ICP-MS. No significant difference between the data sets was observed. A comparison of permanent modifiers was made for the determination of Sb in slurries of sediment and soil samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">147</span></sup></a> The paper, by Dobrowolski <span class="italic">et al.</span> compared the performance of a mixture of iridium/niobium with that of iridium/tungsten. Slurries were prepared by grinding the material so that &gt;80% was &lt;25 μm in diameter, then adding concentrated HF (100 μL), and waiting for 20 min. A slurry of PTFE (100 μL of 60%) was added followed by 800 μL of pure water. The sample was then shaken for 2 min and vortex mixed prior to analysis. The aim of the HF and PTFE addition was to remove the silica during the pyrolysis stage (at 900 °C) which would otherwise have produced a large background signal during the atomization stage. The integrated absorbance results were interesting in that a mixture of iridium/tungsten led to a decrease of absorbance of approximately 30% compared with that obtained using iridium alone, whereas the mixture of iridium/niobium led to a relative increase of 30%. The optimal amount of iridium/niobium was 30 μg and 40 μg, respectively. The procedure was validated by the successful analysis of the CRMs PACS-1 and SL-1 sediment and NIST SRM 2709 (San Joaquin soil) and SRM 2711 (Montana soil). The iridium/niobium mix allowed modification for up to 180 heating cycles. A LOD of 0.04 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was achieved, calibration ranged from 2.5–50 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, characteristic mass was 10.6 pg and precision was typically better than 6% RSD.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Not all matrix modifiers are designed to thermally stabilize the analytes since some deliberately <span class="italic">make the analyte more volatile</span> and/or prevent it from forming refractory compounds, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, carbides, with the graphite atomizer.

The Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> – diethyldithiocarbamate chelate is volatile and could therefore be volatilized into the ICP-MS detector at a much lower temperature than the Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>. By using a simple temperature program, the two species could effectively be separated and detected. The LOD for the Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was 0.045 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and precision for 1 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was 4.6%. The linear range spanned three orders of magnitude and the method was applied to the analysis of water samples. Recoveries were reportedly 94.3–103%. The second paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">149</span></sup></a> was similar in design, but used the compound thenoyltrifluoroacetone as the modifier to form a volatile chelate with Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>.

          <span>Several applications of the <span class="italic">analysis of gunshot residue</span> have been presented. A paper by Freitas <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit150"><sup><span class="sup_ref">150</span></sup></a> analysed the gunshot residue in fabrics around the entrance holes of bullets fired from three different guns. Five different fabrics (canvas, microfibre, flannel, a type of cotton and polyester) were tested. The same area of fabric (2.25 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>) was cut around the bullet hole and this was digested in 10% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>. The analytes Ba, Pb and Sb were then determined in the digests using SF-ICP-MS. Results (in units of μg cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) were plotted on two dimensional ternary graphs. The elemental distributions were very different for the different gun types, making distinction between them simple. Yanez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">151</span></sup></a> used atomic spectrometric analysis of swabs taken from the hands of both shooters and non-shooters in an attempt to discriminate between the two main brands of ammunition available in Chile. The analytes of interest included Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mo, Pb, Sb and Zn and the analytical techniques employed were FAAS, ETAAS and ICP-OES. Cotton swabs soaked in 2% EDTA were used to collect the samples and, once taken, the swabs were soaked in 2 mL of 10% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and sonicated for 5 min. Finally, to ensure the release of the metals into solution, the swab and extracting solution were digested at 80 °C for 1 h and diluted to 10 mL ready for the analysis. The data were plotted using both binary and ternary plots and then analysed further using RDA and PCA. When the data were plotted, it was easy to distinguish shooters from non-shooters and differentiation between the different brands of ammunition was also simple (with 100% success rate). Gunshot residue taken from porcine flesh was analysed using ICP-MS in a study by Udey <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152</span></sup></a> who were attempting to differentiate between jacketed and un-jacketed ammunition types. The study spanned a total of 49 days and so fresh wounds and tissue in moderate decay were analysed. Tissue (0.35–0.5 g) was microwave digested using a mixture of HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and diluted with water prior to analysis. Five analytes (Ba, Cu, Fe, Pb and Sb) were used for the differentiation study and a mixture of In and Bi was used for internal standardization. No relevant CRM was available and so the authors used the NIST water reference material SRM 1643e. Chemometric analysis of the data using ANOVA and Student's <span class="italic">t</span>-test showed that in fresh tissue samples the analytes Cu, Pb and Sb could be used to distinguish the two bullet types at the 95% confidence level. In the decomposing tissues, Cu and Pb alone could be used to differentiate the different bullet types with a certainty of 99%.</span>

          <span>This part of the review contains an assortment of other applications of the analysis of inorganic materials that do not fit readily into other sections. The feasibility of using <span class="italic">LIBS for the differentiation of provenance of 11 different sea salts</span> was tested by Tan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">153</span></sup></a> The LIBS instrument determined the analytes over the wavelength range 760 to 800 nm, because this area had emission lines for ionic Ca, atomic lines of Al, K, Mg and the molecular band for CN. The data obtained were comparable to those obtained using ICP-OES. Chemometric (PCA) analysis of the LIBS data provided score plots with high degrees of clustering, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the potential for differentiation between samples was high. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was also used successfully to evaluate the data and to develop classification models.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Several other <span class="italic">applications</span> have also been reported. The determination of Hg in compact fluorescent lamps was described by Singhvi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">154</span></sup></a> The cap and electronic parts were removed carefully, ensuring that the bulb itself was not broken. The bulb was then placed in a polypropylene bottle containing glass marbles or stoppers as well as a mixture of nitric acid and bromine monochloride solution. The bottle was shaken to break the lamp. The Hg released was absorbed completely by the bromine monochloride solution. This was then analysed using CV-AAS. Recovery was high (90–110%) and repeatability was good. Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> reported the determination of some REEs (Ho, La and Tb) in marine sediments and in high purity REE oxide materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> Since the analytes are at such low concentration and the determination was done using microwave plasma torch OES, a pre-concentration step was necessary to obtain sufficient analyte to be determined reliably. The authors used a micro-column packed with a titanium dioxide–graphene composite to pre-concentrate the analytes. The high purity REE oxide material was dissolved in HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and the sediment was prepared by acid digestion using HF, HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and HClO<small><sub>4</sub></small>. Sample was flowed through the column at a rate of 2 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 1.5 min and then HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (1.5 M) was used to elute the retained analytes directly into the detector. All of the usual parameters, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> sample and eluent flow rates, pH of sample, concentration of eluent, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, were optimized during the study. The LOD were 2.8, 2.2 and 1.6 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Ho, La and Tb respectively; enrichment factors ranged from 10.2 to 17.1. Precision (<span class="italic">n</span> = 7) for the target analytes was also good, being between 1.3 and 3.6% RSD. The authors validated their method by analysing the reference material GBW07313 (marine sediment).</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers reported the <span class="italic">analysis of gaseous samples</span>. Gerdes and Carter<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit156"><sup><span class="sup_ref">156</span></sup></a> described a method by which aqueous calibration standards could be used for the direct analysis of gas phase samples, albeit in a semi-quantitative manner. Empirical factors relating ion generation and transmission efficiencies to standard operating parameters were generated that were similar to the instrument's own semi-quantitative software algorithms. Equations were produced that enabled the prediction of relative ionization efficiencies and isotopic transmission which allowed for the adjustment of limited parameters between liquid and gas injection modes. Using the method developed, the authors analysed a single liquid sample containing 45 elements using <small><sup>133</sup></small>Cs as an internal standard. The concentrations of most of the other analytes were quantified to within 50% of the real value. The study was expanded to predict the concentration of Hg in a liquid sample (correct to within 12% of the actual concentration) and its determination in a gaseous sample (correct to within 28%). Although clearly only semi-quantitative, the technique does offer the advantage of speed of analysis compared with a standard method of air analysis. The other example of the analysis of gas was prepared by Hoffmann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> who analysed the gaseous reaction products of wet chemical silicon etching using conventional direct current GD-OES. The mechanism of the chemical etching of silicon is not fully understood. In this study, different ratios of HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>–HF were used and the H evolved was monitored at 121.5 and 656.3 nm using a commercial GD-OES instrument with a standard Grimm type GD chamber. A small amount of the gas evolved during the etching of silicon in a PTFE container was transported in a stream of argon through a drying column and into the plasma produced by the continuous GD sputtering of an iron sample. Although other elements, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, B, N, O and Si were also detected, it was only the H that was monitored closely. Results indicated that the amount of H released was inversely related with the amount of HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> present. A study of temperature (between −10 and 35 °C) of the etch solution demonstrated that this parameter had a negligible effect on the H generation, but did affect the amount of nitrous gases evolved. The study enabled the authors to elucidate the mechanism of the etch process, although some questions remained unanswered.</p>

The most interesting parts of the paper from this review's perspective, is that is also discussed some of the most recent approaches used to characterize the materials. These include the introduction of single particles and FFF or size exclusion chromatography coupled with the plasma-based detectors. A similar review by Jimenez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159</span></sup></a> contained 96 references. This review concentrated on methods of nanoparticle characterization such as PAGE, different types of FFF and size exclusion chromatography coupled with detection using ICP-MS. Also discussed were the papers that had undertaken single particle detection. A review (188 references) that concentrated on flow FFF for the analysis and characterization of natural colloids and engineered nanoparticles in environmental systems was prepared by Baalousha <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit160"><sup><span class="sup_ref">160</span></sup></a> Although FFF is a powerful tool on its own for the high resolution characterization of particle size distribution, when it is coupled with other detectors such as ICP-MS, TEM, AFM, fluorescence and UV-VIS absorbance, it can provide a wealth of information on the composition and shape of the particles. The review was designed to give its readers the theoretical principles and considerations of flow FFF and the range of analytical tools that may be coupled with it to characterize the particles more fully. In addition, how its results compare with other techniques and a range of applications were also given. For those capable of reading Chinese, mention should also be made of a review by Qu <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> who discussed, with the aid of 76 references, the techniques of synchrotron radiation XRF, XAFS, XANES, EXAFS, synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy, ICP-MS and NAA methods of analyzing nanoparticles. A review by da Silva <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> containing 73 references, discussed the analytical chemistry of metallic nanoparticles in the environment. The authors stated why determination of the particles size is important and that traditionally, methods such as micro-, nano- and cross-flow-filtration as well as ultra-centrifugation have been used to determine it. Similarly, the chemical characterization has traditionally been undertaken using techniques such as TEM and SEM (often combined with EDAX) and XRD. The review emphasized the limitations of such traditional techniques and described how coupling together of different techniques with powerful detectors such as ICP-MS can lead to more information being obtained. Also discussed in the review were methods of isolating the nanoparticles from environmental samples.</span>

            <span>The different types of FFF have been used for several years now and represent powerful methods of analysis of particulate matter. As well as the reviews cited above that discussed the techniques and how they may be coupled with atomic spectrometric detectors, other individual papers have also been produced. Songsilawat <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit163"><sup><span class="sup_ref">163</span></sup></a> described the use of flow <span class="italic">FFF with off-line detection using ETAAS</span> to characterize Ag nanoparticles stabilized in citrate, pectin and alginate. It is known that nanoparticles can aggregate forming much larger collections of materials and that these can settle in solution and hence not present a representative sample when introduced through a standard nebulizer/spray chamber assembly of an atomic spectrometry instrument. The citrate-stabilized nanoparticles were prepared by using sodium citrate as a capping agent on Ag nanoparticles produced by sodium borohydride reduction of silver nitrate. The pectin and alginate-stabilized materials were prepared from Ag nanoparticles prepared from the ascorbic acid reduction of silver nitrate. The three types of material were characterized using flow FFF, zeta potentiometry and TEM. The mean particle size differed markedly between the three types, with diameters of 9, 19 and 45 nm for the citrate-stabilized, pectin-stabilized and alginate-stabilized materials respectively. The flow FFF-ETAAS approach to determining the different types of nanoparticle in different water systems demonstrated that the citrate-stabilized nanoparticles aggregated more rapidly than the other materials. This was attributed to the other types being stabilized sterically as well as chemically. The presence of humic acid in the waters did help prolong the stability of the citrate-based materials though.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Another paper that described a study into the <span class="italic">effect of natural organic matter and ionic strength on the stability of Ag nanoparticles</span> in the aqueous phase was presented by Delay <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit164"><sup><span class="sup_ref">164</span></sup></a> Asymmetric flow FFF was coupled with both UV-VIS and ICP-MS detection systems for the analysis. After preparation using sodium borohydride reduction of silver nitrate, the particles were suspended in different aqueous solutions of differing ionic strength and natural organic matter content. The presence of natural organic matter helped stabilize the materials and this was attributed to them coating the particle, thereby stabilizing them sterically. The organic matter went some way to overcoming the de-stabilizing effects of increased ionic strength. Poda <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> also coupled FFF with ICP-MS to characterize Ag nanoparticles. The primary particle size was first characterized using TEM and the hydrodynamic size measurements obtained using FFF were comparable to those obtained using dynamic light scattering. Detection of the materials using ICP-MS was, as expected, extremely sensitive with standards of mixed Ag nanoparticles with concentrations at the μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level being determined readily. Once optimized, the technique was applied to the determination of Ag nanoparticles in a biological system. The fresh water, sediment-dwelling oligochaete <span class="italic">Lumbriculus variegatus</span> was exposed to a sample of well-characterized Ag nanoparticles and then the post-exposure tissues were extracted and analysed. The Ag nanoparticles increased in size significantly during the exposure. This would have implications for the overall toxicity of the material.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Size characterization and quantification of Ag nanoparticles was also studied by Bolea <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a> who used <span class="italic">asymmetric flow FFF</span> coupled with ICP-MS for the determination. The authors went to great lengths to avoid aggregation processes, alteration of the original size distributions of the particles and losses from sorption processes onto the channel membrane. The mobile phase composition, injection, focussing and fractionation conditions were all optimized in terms of their influence on both the separation resolution and recovery. The ionic strength, pH and the presence of ionic and non-ionic surfactants had a strong influence. Better results were obtained when conditions were used that favoured charge repulsion with the membrane. Commercially available Ag nanoparticles were use for the size calibration of the FFF channel and direct injection of ionic Ag standards was used to calibrate the ICP-MS instrument. Integration of the peaks and interpolation of the fractogram area was used for the quantification. Of the consumer products analysed, recoveries were 83 ± 8% and 93 ± 4% with respect to the content of the Ag nanoparticles. Results obtained were comparable to those obtained using photon correlation spectroscopy and TEM images. The prospects and limitations of asymmetric flow FFF used in combination with a multi-stage detection system consisting of UV-VIS spectrometry, light scattering and ICP-MS with respect to the characterization of Au nanoparticles were discussed by Hagendorfer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">167</span></sup></a> Use of a citrate-based dispersant ensured that the ICP-MS signal obtained for the nanoparticles was the same as for ionic Au standards for concentrations between 1 and 50 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and for particle sizes ranging from 5 to 80 nm. The FFF membrane and carrier flow conditions were optimized, but particle interaction with the membrane could be problematic in some cases, which led to retention time shifts and losses of nanoparticles. Consequently, the authors used ultra-centrifugation followed by ICP-MS detection to distinguish between ionic and particulate Au species. Despite this, the results obtained using the multi-stage detection system were comparable to those obtained using batch dynamic light scattering and using TEM. The method was validated further by analysis of the standard Au nanoparticle materials NIST 8011, 8012 and 8013; with results being in excellent agreement with certified values.</p>

            <span>
              <span class="italic">Single particle analysis</span> is an emerging technique that enables the determination of both the size and the number of metal-containing particles entering the instrument. It also has the benefit of being capable of characterizing nanoparticles at concentrations relevant to the environment. Mitrano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> demonstrated the process using ICP-MS as the detection system in a paper that described the analysis of a sample containing a well-characterized sample of Ag nanoparticles and a health food sample that also contained Ag nanoparticles. Serial dilution, filtration and acidification confirmed that the method detected particles. The authors applied their method to the analysis of wastewaters and demonstrated that Ag nanoparticles at 100–200 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> could clearly be differentiated from Ag ions at a concentration of 50–500 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A paper by Pace <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> presented a practical guide on achieving single particle analysis. One of the most important factors involved is the transport (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> nebulization) efficiency and several methods for calculating this was demonstrated. Well-characterized monodisperse Ag nanoparticles demonstrated the importance of knowing the transport efficiency accurately when calculating both the particle number concentration and the particle size.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Laborda <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">170</span></sup></a> used the <span class="italic">different behaviours of dissolved Ag and Ag nanoparticles</span> to differentiate between the two in aqueous samples. Using ICP-MS with a time resolution of 5 ms as a means of detection, they introduced both Ag nanoparticle suspensions at a number concentration of &lt;10<small><sup>9</sup></small> L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and Ag ions through a conventional pneumatic nebulizer. The Ag ion solutions produced pulses of averaged constant intensity. Conversely, the Ag nanoparticles were converted by the plasma into a packet of ions that produced discrete pulses, the intensities of which were proportional to the number of Ag atoms in the particle, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the size. Frequency plots with respect to the intensity measured for each pulse showed independent distributions for dissolved Ag ions and nanoparticles (Poisson and lognormal, respectively). Interestingly, the size limitation for the Ag nanoparticle was 18 nm (approximately 32 ag). This particle size is significantly smaller than the 2–3 μm limit normally associated with the introduction of suspended solids through a conventional nebulizer/spray chamber assembly.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The advantages of using <span class="italic">micro-droplet generators</span> rather than conventional nebulizers to introduce nanoparticles to ICP-MS instruments have been demonstrated by Gschwind <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> A droplet size of between 30 and 40 μm could be reproduced accurately and this led to 100% transport efficiency to the plasma. Analyses were conducted using standard ion solutions containing 1, 2, 5 or 10 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Ag, Au, Au and Cu respectively) and with highly diluted suspensions of Ag and Au nanoparticles of &lt;110 nm in size. Detection efficiency was reportedly 10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> counts per atom, but the LOQ for the nanoparticles were size-related and were 21 nm and 33 nm for Au and Ag respectively. Helium was chosen as the aerosol transport gas since this enabled the aerosol to be desolvated, hence preventing their agglomeration/precipitation. The authors also used an oscilloscope to collect the data at shorter dwell times (500 μs) than the instrument software would allow (a minimum of 10 ms). This decreased the possibility of more than one particle being detected simultaneously.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Kapellios and Pergantis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> have combined the use of <span class="italic">ion mobility spectrometry</span> with off-line ICP-MS detection for determining nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The size and metal content enabled the determination of the concentration of the nanoparticles. The resolving power of the ion mobility spectrometry and the detection power of the ICP-MS instrument as well as the single particle mode it offers were the main features the authors quoted as being attractive for the analysis of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were separated according to size by setting a metal collection cup with an appropriate voltage (up to a maximum of −10 kV). Small nanoparticles required a low voltage whereas larger ones required high voltages. The particles collected in that cup were then dispersed in water and analysed using ICP-MS through conventional pneumatic nebulization. In this example Au nanoparticles obtained from NIST that had a nominal diameter of 60 nm were tested. The authors used a collection voltage of −9.5 kV to collect the material and then dispersed them using 1 mL of deionized water prior to subsequent ICP-MS determination using a rapid dwell time of 10 ms. The authors admitted that the possibility of multiple particles being detected during the same 10 ms dwell time could not be totally excluded, despite the large dilution that had occurred.</p>

            <span>To overcome problems associated with the introduction of nanoparticles to ICP instruments some authors have resorted to converting them to ions through a <span class="italic">digestion procedure.</span> Khosravi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> used ammonium persulfate to digest titanium dioxide nanoparticles present in aqueous suspensions and biosolids. The aqueous samples contained 6 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of Ti present as 10 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> suspensions of rutile, anatase or a mixture of nano-sized crystals. Only 1 g of the fusing agent was required for the rapid destruction of the particles yielding a recovery of 95%. This figure was higher than that obtained using a three component acid digestion on a hotplate and was comparable to that obtained using the same acid mixture in a microwave oven. A study of the effects of cations and anions present in the range 10 ng to 110 mg indicated that there were no significant interferences. The LOD obtained using ICP-MS as a means of detection was 0.06 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The digestion procedure was applied to the analysis of treated and untreated wastewater samples and biosolids collected from wastewater treatment plants. Some metal particles are encapsulated in a silica shell to decrease bio-toxicity. A paper by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a> described a method involving microwave digestion and ICP-OES detection that was capable of determining this coating efficiency. Three acid digestion mixtures were tested for this. Aqua regia was capable of dissolving those metal particles not coated with the silica and a mixture of HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HF was better at digesting those particles that had got the coating. The coating efficiency could therefore be calculated. Analysis of nanoparticles produced during a welding process in which tetramethylsilane had been added to the shielding gas indicated that, depending on the conditions used, between 14 and 39% of the fume particulates were encapsulated in the silica casing.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">A method of <span class="italic">distinguishing between ionic Ag in solution and Ag nanoparticles</span> present in environmental waters and commercial anti-bacterial materials was described by Chao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> Nanoparticulate Ag was determined after Triton X-114 was used for the cloud point extraction of the samples and, after a microwave assisted acid digestion of the organic-rich extracts, the Ag was determined using ICP-MS.

The LOQ was 0.4 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Ag associated with the nanoparticles and 0.2 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for total Ag, although the authors did note that reliable determination occurred only at total Ag concentrations of higher than 3 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Spike/recovery experiments conducted on commercial anti-bacterial products yielded slightly variable data, with recoveries in the range 71.7–103% being achieved.

The very low fluorescence yields of H and O mean that the water cannot be determined directly. Instead, the authors took advantage of the attenuation of the Si fluorescence yield by the presence of water to determine the water content indirectly. This is possible because the extent of the signal attenuation is directly proportional to the water content, with linear regression equations of &gt; 0.9 being obtained. In addition, both Compton and Rayleigh scattering of the X-ray tube lines Rh K-L(2,3) and Rh K-M(2,3) was also proportional to the water content. Good linearity of this latter method was obtained over the water content range 0–61.5%. One problem was noted though and this was that the porosity of the material had a significant influence, especially at low levels of water content (up to 7.5%). The sensitivity for a silica nanopowder with well-defined mesopores (3 nm in diameter) decreased to 0.40 kcps/wt% compared with 0.99 kcps/wt% for non-porous materials. The morphology of cobalt nanoparticles embedded in silica and then subjected to heavy-ion irradiation was investigated over a wide energy and fluence range by Sprouster <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> Using TEM and small angle X-ray scattering as means of detection, nanoparticles below a certain diameter remained spherical in shape but became smaller under irradiation. This was attributed to their gradual dissolution. However, larger particles became rod-like in appearance with their longer dimension being parallel to the incident ion direction. The state of the Co present in the nanoparticles was determined using XANES. Prior to irradiation, only Co atoms were present. However, after irradiation, both atomic Co and oxidized Co were present; an indication, according to the authors, of dissolution. The structure of the nanoparticles was then examined using EXAFS. Increased fluence of the heavy ion irradiation led to an increase in disorder, a decrease in bond length and asymmetric deviation from a Gaussian inter-atomic distance distribution.</p>

Two reversed phase columns with differing pore sizes were used to separate different sized nanoparticles using a size exclusion type mechanism.

The measurement of such a ratio in samples of known origin and determining whether or not there is a correlation between them would be a useful indicator for nuclear forensic or for non-proliferation purposes. Samples were selected from four different mines in Australia, Brazil and Canada. The U was extracted from the materials and then separated from the matrix using UTEVA (R) resin. Determination of the analytes was achieved successfully using AMS. A paper by Burger <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185</span></sup></a> described the determination of <small><sup>236</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratio as well as Pu in samples, but this time using total evaporation methods followed by multicollector TIMS measurement. The <small><sup>236</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratio could be measured over almost 10 orders of magnitude, with LOD for U being at the ppb range. Samples analysed included oxides, metals, yellowcake, alloys, uranium ores and hydrolysed uranium hexafluoride. Samples were digested and diluted using HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>. The determination of the Pu often required chemical separation from the U and other potential interferents by using either trioctylphosphine oxide or UTEVA resin. In addition, the Pu could also be pre-concentrated using the same methodology. Sample digests were loaded directly onto tungsten filaments for the analysis with the Pu being present in the range 50–100 ng and U being at approximately 500 ng per filament. Comparison of data obtained using the total evaporation method from a latest generation instrument and from a previous generation instrument indicated that modern instrumentation led to an improvement in reproducibility by a factor of at least three and sometimes by over an order of magnitude. Analysis of a CRM using a modern instrument yielded data within the uncertainty values of the material, but at vastly improved repeatability. The authors pointed out that this was probably because many of the CRMs were prepared several decades ago and that this highlighted the requirement of new CRMs or re-certification of existing ones. Shewhart charts were employed to maintain analytical quality control throughout the study. Other aspects of the study included memory effects of high levels of U and the formation of uranium hydride and the affect this had on Pu determination and on the U isotope ratios.</span>

Usually, a low resolution spectrometer suffices for LIBS applications, but a much higher resolution spectrometer is required for isotopic work because the difference in wavelength between different isotopes is extremely small (25 pm for U and 13 pm for Pu). However, to be of real use, the spectrometer must be sufficiently small to be deployable in field-based scenarios. The authors reported the use of a hand-held LIBS probe that was used in combination with two new spectrometers that had a resolution (lambda/delta lambda) of 75<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 in one and 44<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 in the other.

          <span>As with all analytical applications, the requirement of having interference free analysis is paramount. Since an assortment of interference types exist for several of the potential analytes, methods have been described that either ameliorate them or perhaps remove them completely.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">During <span class="italic">quadrupole-based mass spectrometric analysis</span>, these interferences may be polyatomic, isobaric or non-spectral (physical) in nature. A paper by Amr and Abdel-Lateef<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit188"><sup><span class="sup_ref">188</span></sup></a> compared the capability of collision/reaction cell quadrupole-based instrumentation with that of SF-ICP-MS instruments for the determination of <small><sup>137</sup></small>Cs, <small><sup>226</sup></small>Ra and <small><sup>90</sup></small>Sr. The <small><sup>90</sup></small>Sr is overlapped by <small><sup>90</sup></small>Zr on quadrupole instruments and therefore direct determination is complicated. The use of oxygen in the collision reaction cell converted the <small><sup>90</sup></small>Zr to ZrO whilst leaving the <small><sup>90</sup></small>Sr unreacted. A similar approach was adopted during the determination of <small><sup>137</sup></small>Cs in the presence of <small><sup>137</sup></small>Ba. This time, nitrous oxide was used as the collision/reaction cell gas, with the Ba forming BaO and BaOH, leaving the unreacted <small><sup>137</sup></small>Cs available for measurement. Helium and hydrogen overcame interferences on <small><sup>226</sup></small>Ra. The authors applied their methods to the determination of the analytes in a range of materials including pottery and plants. The SF instrument required high resolution to overcome some of the polyatomic/isobaric interferences and hence the sensitivity was diminished. The digestion methods for the samples were described, as were the resin-based protocols for matrix elimination and/or pre-concentration required for the SF-ICP-MS determinations. The conclusion was that the quadrupole instrument could overcome the interferences in an efficient manner resulting in the rapid determination of the analytes and was therefore preferable to the longer methods required by the SF instrument. Further method validation was achieved by analysing the samples using gamma ray spectrometry. Another example of interference removal was presented by Fujiwara <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">189</span></sup></a> who overcame interference effects from <small><sup>129</sup></small>Xe<small><sup>+</sup></small> (present as an impurity in the argon plasma gas) and <small><sup>127</sup></small>I<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> on <small><sup>129</sup></small>I<small><sup>+</sup></small>. The former was removed by using oxygen as the gas introduced to the dynamic reaction cell. The latter was removed by ensuring that all traces of hydrogen and water vapour were removed from the reaction gas and by careful optimization of the instrumental operating conditions; especially the ion optics. A deviation from linearity was observed on the signal obtained at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 129, but the authors corrected this by usıng a Rh internal standard. Even in the presence of 1 mg L<small><sup>−1 127</sup></small>I, the LOD for <small><sup>129</sup></small>I was 15.2 pg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The protocol developed was applied to the determination of <small><sup>129</sup></small>I in soils around a Japanese nuclear fuel re-processing plant.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Sector field ICP-MS instruments</span> may also be used to overcome some polyatomic interferences. A paper by Pointurier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit190"><sup><span class="sup_ref">190</span></sup></a> discussed how PbO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>, ArHg<small><sup>+</sup></small> and IrO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> may interfere during the determination of Pu at either <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 239 or 240 in dust swipe samples taken from a nuclear plant. Although the counts per second originating from these molecules is usually very low, it is still above the baseline observed during aspiration of dilute acid and could, therefore, constitute a potential interference. The acid leach process and the ion exchange methodology used to separate the U, Th and Pu fractions were described. The anion exchange purification goes a long way to interference removal since it removes most of the heavy elements found in such samples. However, as with all sample manipulation procedures, it is prone to contamination from reagents or from glassware and it is these contaminants that may lead to over-estimations of Pu – especially when measuring at the fg level. The prior determination of the level of heavy elements present in the sample was necessary to estimate the possible extent of the problem. Careful centering of the peaks of both the analyte and the heavy metals was also necessary to prevent bias of the count rates. Another paper by the same researchers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">191</span></sup></a> described how the use of medium mass resolution combined with desolvation of the sample enabled the determination of Pu at the fg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level. A mass resolution of 4000 was sufficient to separate the Pu signals from those originating from the polyatomic interferences (as well as from the tail of the larger U signal), but this resulted in a nine-fold loss of ion transmission, and hence a similar drop in sensitivity. Sample desolvation was achieved using a commercial device comprising two spray chambers, the first being heated to evaporate the aerosol and the second being condensing to remove the liquid. Desolvation of the sample partially overcame the signal lost through the use of medium mass resolution since it resulted in a five-fold enhancement of sensitivity. The authors explained at length that the medium mass resolution had to be used in conjunction with the desolvation device, since use of the latter alone also led to an increase in signal originating from the polyatomic interferences. This was because of the increased transport efficiency of the interfering ions to the plasma. Similar samples and sample preparation protocols discussed in the previous paper were also described here. Although not as sensitive as many other methods described in the literature for the determination of Pu, the authors stressed that their method was robust and was reliable even in the presence of significant levels of potentially interfering elements.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Krachler and Wegen<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192</span></sup></a> have investigated the determination of <small><sup>233</sup></small>U using <span class="italic">high resolution ICP-OES</span> at the wavelength 385.950 nm. This wavelength has been used for many years, but the authors contended that it is neither specific for this isotope nor reliable. Spectral overlap by Th and by other U isotopes may occur (since <small><sup>235</sup></small>U and <small><sup>238</sup></small>U are only 5 and 8 pm away) and the resolution required to split the lines is higher than that provided by any commercial instrument. Instead, the authors used lines around 411.6 nm and 424.4 nm. Unfortunately, although the latter has the largest difference in wavelength between the different U isotopes, it suffers from a strong spectral overlap from Th. The region around the 411.6 nm line, although not having as clearly resolved U isotope peaks as the 424.4 nm line, did not suffer the Th interference to the same extent. Not only did the Th line at 411.577 nm have an intensity approximately a tenth of that at 424.393 nm, but it also appeared at a wavelength 8 pm away from the <small><sup>233</sup></small>U line, a sufficient distance for a high resolution spectrometer to distinguish between the two.</p>

          <span>The use of LIBS for nuclear applications has increased in this review period. Papers by Huber <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193–195</span></sup></a> described the use <span class="italic">of LIBS for the surface characterization and</span>/<span class="italic">or the analysis of hydrocarbon layers</span> deposited on the surface of fusion devices. In one application,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> the LIBS system was placed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber (&lt;10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> Pa). A Q-switched ruby laser with a maximum energy of 1 J and a pulse duration of 15 ns was used to excite the sample, the light from which was collected parallel to the sample surface within a volume of 1 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> and guided into a fibre that transmitted the light to an Echelle spectrometer capable of measuring over the wavelength range 375 to 715 nm. In this application, other laser-based techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> laser-induced desorption spectroscopy (to determine hydrogen isotopes retained on the components of the wall) and laser-induced ablation spectroscopy (to determine layer thickness), were also used simultaneously to characterize the materials. Laser-induced desorption spectroscopy proved to be a reliable method for the determination of the H isotopes retained in the wall of a TOKAMAK, using just a single laser pulse. Gasior <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit196"><sup><span class="sup_ref">196</span></sup></a> also used LIBS successfully to determine fuel retention and composition of mixed material layers of walls in fusion reactors. These authors used a Nd:YAG laser operating at an energy of 0.6 J, lasting 3 ns and with a repetition rate of 10 Hz to excite the sample materials and an intensified CCD capable of registering the emitted light over the wavelength range 200–970 nm as a detector. Future work by these authors will be to study calibrated samples and to develop better models of dependency between the spectroscopic signals and the material matrix so that a better estimate of hydrogen isotope presence can be made. Other authors to have presented work using LIBS to characterize walls of reactors included Almaviva <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit197"><sup><span class="sup_ref">197</span></sup></a> Paris <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit198"><sup><span class="sup_ref">198</span></sup></a> and Mercadier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit199"><sup><span class="sup_ref">199</span></sup></a> In the paper by Paris <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit198"><sup><span class="sup_ref">198</span></sup></a> the fluctuations in the signal to background ratio of single shot LIBS spectra led the authors to develop a procedure in which spectra from different sites on the sample were averaged. This improved the signal to background ratio significantly and yielded depth-profile data in good qualitative agreement with those obtained using other techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, SIMS and RBS. The method developed also helped overcome the problems caused by surface imperfections that can have an adverse effect on the signal. However, the procedure would inevitably rely on the sample being homogeneous, otherwise poor precision would result.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">A dual pulse application of LIBS</span> was reported by Lee <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit200"><sup><span class="sup_ref">200</span></sup></a> who determined B and Li in aqueous solutions. The procedure developed used two Nd:YAG lasers operating at 532 nm, one to vaporize the surface of a laminar water jet and the second to excite the analytes within the vapour causing them to emit light. Optimization of the timings between the two laser pulses was required to obtain optimal sensitivity. The time gap was &lt; 3 ms for the B but approximately 10 ms for the Li. Using these optimal conditions, LOD for B and Li were 0.8 ppm and 0.8 ppb respectively. Although the LOD for B, being 0.8 ppm, appears not to be terribly impressive, it represented an improvement of approximately two orders of magnitude compared with other research reported in the literature. The method developed was applied to the determination of the analytes in boric acid and lithium hydroxide which act as the neutron absorber and pH controller in the primary coolant water of pressurized water reactors.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Lasers have also been used for techniques other than LIBS. Pointurier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit201"><sup><span class="sup_ref">201</span></sup></a> used <span class="italic">LA-ICP-MS</span> with a quadrupole-based instrument for the isotopic analysis of single submicrometer-sized uranium particles. The particles were extracted from their original matrix using ethanol and placed on a polycarbonate disk where they were fixed using an organic compound. The particle size for the majority of the particles was confirmed to be &lt;1 μm using SEM prior to analysis. A nanosecond UV laser (213 nm) was used for the ablation process. The particles contained <small><sup>235</sup></small>U at the femtogram range, but the authors still managed to determine the <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratio successfully. Although the results obtained exhibited much poorer precision than those obtained using SIMS and FT-TIMS, they were in good agreement. Agreement was also obtained with certified values when analysing CRMs.</p>

The review contained 76 references and discussed how these analytes, in particular, can suffer from polyatomic interferences. The use of several of the more common reaction gases including ammonia, methane, hydrogen and oxygen; but also of less commonly used ones such as nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, fluoromethane, sulfur hexafluoride and carbon disulfide were discussed. In reaction cell technology, there are several mechanisms postulated for overcoming interferences. These include charge transfer reactions, atom transfer, adduct formation, condensation and analyte association/condensation. Since the reaction between the gas and the interfering ions is exothermic and that between the gas and the analyte is endothermic, the choice of gas and knowledge of the reaction mechanism is necessary to obtain maximal interference removal. The authors considered the different approaches that may be adopted and the mechanisms with which they work in the context of the analysis of polymers, biological fluids, rock, soils and particulate matter.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Method validation is required to ensure the quality of the data being produced.

Ostermann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> discussed the homogeneity and stability of a new material called BAM-H010, which consists of an acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene terpolymer doped with different contents of Br, Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb. The determination of these analytes in such a material is a requirement under the EU directive 2002/95/EG, which is commonly known as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and applies to waste materials produced by the electronics industry. Analysis of the material using XRF spectrometry demonstrated that any uncertainty associated with the long-term thermal stability was negligible compared with that from either the method of analysis or the batch inhomogeneity. The material degraded though, forming long and short chain products after exposure to hard X-rays.

          <span>The research group at Oviedo have continued with their studies using <span class="italic">glow discharge time of flight mass spectrometry</span> (GD-TOF-MS). A review/overview paper by Pereiro <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a> (109 references) entitled “present and future of glow discharge-time of flight mass spectrometry in analytical chemistry” discussed the recent developments in instrumentation. These developments have led to significant advances in the ability to undertake multi-elemental depth-profile analysis of layered samples with increasingly high resolution, the identification of polymers and direct speciation in solid samples. The review highlighted recent applications, including those that have used GD-TOF-MS as a detector for gas chromatography and for the analysis of permanent gases and for vaporized compounds. A paper by de Vega <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit217"><sup><span class="sup_ref">217</span></sup></a> discussed the use of the pulsed version of GD-TOF-MS for the screening of polymer-based coatings containing brominated flame retardants. The aim was to obtain good sensitivity for both elemental and polyatomic ions whilst maintaining long term signal stability. With this in mind, the system was optimized, in terms of power (15 W) and pressure (200 Pa) using the model compound tetrabromobisphenol. Both ms and μs duration pulses were tested, with the former yielding better LOD and a higher number of polyatomic ions. Using the optimized conditions, LOD well below 0.1% were obtained for both atomic Br and for the fragments. The different fragments produced could be used to identify and to discriminate between different sample types containing different brominated fire retardants. A third paper by this research group,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit218"><sup><span class="sup_ref">218</span></sup></a> investigated the afterglow time region (especially the plateau and transient afterglow regions) of a pulsed GD using TOF-MS. Using a pulse period of 4 ms and a 50% duty cycle, the influence of the discharge parameters on the afterglow delay and shape of the ions Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small>, Ar<small><sup>2+</sup></small> and the analytes Cr, Cl and Cu from polymeric layers were investigated. The Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small> shapes were affected by both pressure and power, with the plateau region having high intensity at low pressure, but the afterpeak dominating at higher (&gt;600 Pa) pressure. The effects of power were less significant, but a widening of the afterglow time region for Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small> was observed with increasing power. The maximum intensity of the Ar<small><sup>2+</sup></small> was observed using 60 W, the highest power employed, whilst the ratio of maximum intensity/afterglow area remained approximately constant with power. The mechanism of ionization was also studied, and results indicated that analytes with ionization potentials below the argon metastable energy (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Cu) or just above it (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Br) show maximal intensities after the argon ions decay, indicating that they may be ionized by collisions with metastable argon atoms. Other analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Cl, give the best signal in the afterglow region, even though their ionization potential is significantly greater than the argon metastable levels. In addition, they followed a similar pattern to that observed for Ar<small><sup>2+</sup></small>. The authors hypothesized that this may be because a charge transfer process with Ar<small><sup>2+</sup></small> could play a role.</span>

          <span>In general, LIBS was the most commonly used laser-based technique because of its portability, ease of use and relatively simple instrumentation. Several applications have been reported that have used <span class="italic">LIBS for polymer identification</span>. Gregoire <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit219"><sup><span class="sup_ref">219</span></sup></a> used the fourth harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (266 nm) to excite the samples and measured emission from Swan bands to differentiate between the different polymer types. Differentiation could be made between polymers that had no C–C bonds (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, polyoxomethylene), some C–C bonds (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, polyoxyethylene) and those with aromatic C–C linkages. Further analysis using PCA and partial least squares regression enabled the differentiation between many polymers including those with similar structure, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, polyethylene and polypropylene. A similar publication, by Anzano <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit220"><sup><span class="sup_ref">220</span></sup></a> also used LIBS to classify polymers. These authors used chemometric techniques such as PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis to analyse experimental data to aid the identification. It was concluded that the rapid, sample non-destructive method of LIBS could be used on-line at recycling plants with the aid of the chemometrics packages to differentiate between high and low density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and PET. Leme <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit221"><sup><span class="sup_ref">221</span></sup></a> studied the effects of repetition rate and number of pulses on the ablated mass and the appearance of the craters during the analysis of polypropylene and high density polyethylene plates containing lead chromate. These authors used a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm with a 5 ns pulse duration to ablate the materials and an Echelle spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD detector to detect light being emitted from Cr and Pb present in the sample. The craters produced by the technique were analysed using SEM and profilometry. The authors tested the effects of 10, 25 and 50 laser pulses with a frequency rate of 1, 5 and 10 Hz with each pulse having 250 mJ of energy, a 2 μs delay time before measurement and a 6 μs integration time. A decrease in repetition rate led to irregular craters and the formation of “edges”. This was especially true for the polypropylene sample. This was attributed to the different plastics having a different degree of crystallinity, crystalline melting temperatures and glass transition temperatures during ablation. The intensities of the Cr and Pb signals obtained at 10 Hz were twice as high as those obtained using 5 Hz when the number of laser pulses was kept constant.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Another laser-based technique that was used for the study of polymers and composites is <span class="italic">laser induced fluorescence</span> (LIF). This technique was used for the multi-elemental analysis of both ceramics and polymers by Chu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit222"><sup><span class="sup_ref">222</span></sup></a> Using an ArF laser the fluorescence signals for Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, In, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Si and Sn were several orders of magnitude higher than the emission signals obtained using LIBS. Fluorescence intensities varied with the fluence and timing of the laser pulse, which was attributed to the presence of particulates within the plume of the ablated material. The authors applied the technique to four different problems. These were: the analysis of paint for Pb content when the concentration of Pb was at the μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range; the analysis of valuable potteries when two similar specimens were differentiated; the elemental analysis of inks where lines written by two different pens could be discriminated and the analysis of electrode–plastic interfaces. All of the applications were virtually non-destructive with damage being hard to identify even under a microscope. For the last application, the sensitivity was reportedly comparable to that obtained using SIMS.</p>

A paper by Santos <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit226"><sup><span class="sup_ref">226</span></sup></a> reported the determination of these analytes using a quadrupole-based ICP-MS method that relied on the use of the reactive gases hydrogen and helium to overcome polyatomic interferences. High flow rates of both gases (80 and 60 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for hydrogen and helium respectively) into the sampled plasma were required to overcome the interferences exerted by <small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>12</sup></small>C<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>12</sup></small>C<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>36</sup></small>S<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small>, and <small><sup>36</sup></small>S<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small> on the Cr isotopes at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 52 and 53 whereas the other analytes could be determined without recourse to the addition of the gases. Detection limits for the Cr were 0.04 (using He) or 0.14 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (using H<small><sub>2</sub></small>). The other analytes had LOD ranging from 0.02–0.08 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cd and Pb to 0.93–0.98 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Hg. The amount of metals in the plastics were in the ranges 16–43, 1–11, 4–12 and 5–13 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cr, Cd, Hg and Pb respectively. A second paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit227"><sup><span class="sup_ref">227</span></sup></a> also reported the determination of trace analytes (this time Br and Sb) in plastics from waste electrical and electronic equipment. The paper, by Miskolczi <span class="italic">et al.</span>, used EDXRF spectrometry to determine the analytes in pyrolysis oils produced from the combustion of high impact polystyrene and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene at temperatures of between 360 and 440 °C. The results from the EDXRF analysis were comparable to those obtained using other accepted methods including bomb calorimetry followed by ion chromatography (EPA method 5050) for Br and acid digestion followed by ICP-OES for Sb. The advantage of the technique over the accepted protocols is that of increased speed of analysis. The authors did report that interferences existed for the EDXRF analysis that correlated with the N content of the oils. However, they also reported that the interference effects were statistically insignificant and that the technique could be regarded as being fit for purpose. Frentiu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit228"><sup><span class="sup_ref">228</span></sup></a> used a new analytical system to determine Hg in non- and biodegradable materials; <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, shopping bags and waste electronic material.

The LOD was reported to be 0.05 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (or 0.08 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the solid material).

            <span class="italic">Sample preparation</span> is always an important factor in a successful analysis and several papers have reported methods that have utilized acid digestions, either with the assistance of microwaves or without. A paper by Matoso and Cadore<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> used an acid digestion in a closed microwave vessel system as a means of sample destruction prior to the ICP-OES determination of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Sb in polyamide raw materials and textiles used for manufacturing sports T-shirts. The analysis of the raw material (polyamide pellets) was validated using the reference materials ERM-BCR 680 and ERM-BCR 681 with good results reportedly being obtained. Recovery factors were in the range 94.4–105.7 % with the precision typically being 0.5–2.2 % RSD. Once the method had been perfected for the raw materials, it was applied to the textiles. One textile in particular, a black fabric, contained 901 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Cr. The authors tested this material further by undertaking lixiviation tests using synthetic sweat and temperature. However, only 0.3% of the Cr leached into the solution. A comparison of microwave assisted acid digestion and microwave induced combustion in closed quartz vessels as sample preparation techniques for polymer digestion and trace elemental determination using ICP-MS and ICP-OES was reported by Pereira <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit230"><sup><span class="sup_ref">230</span></sup></a> Fifteen analytes of interest were determined in sample types such as high and low density polyethylenes, polypropylene, polystyrene, PET (both colourless and green samples), PEEK and nylon 6,6. A mixture of 4 M HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and 4 M HCl was suitable for the microwave induced combustion. Concentrated acids were used for the microwave assisted digestion. The authors concluded that both sample preparation methods were suitable for the analysis but recommended the microwave induced combustion because it used more dilute acids, allowed higher sample mass to be digested and therefore yielded better LOD. The microwave induced combustion technique was also more rapid with eight samples being prepared in 25 minutes compared with more than 50 minutes for the acid digestion protocol. The procedures were validated by the analysis of CRMs and by comparison with data obtained using NAA.

          <span>The <span class="italic">use of TXRF</span> is very common in the semiconductor industry. Several papers have been presented in this review period and the more interesting of these have all originated from the research group based in Vienna. The technique of TXRF has many advantages over other techniques in that it is non-destructive, is sensitive and may produce both qualitative and quantitative data. It does however have a few drawbacks and these include the large statistical uncertainty in wafer surface analysis and the questionable validity of using an internal standard. For small samples, linear calibration is not problematic. However, when large sample masses are used, deviations from the linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and sample amount can occur. This deviation can arise through local inhomogeneities in the sample or through the actual shape of the sample itself. Horntrich <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> used SR μ-XRF spectrometry and optical microscopy to analyse single and multi-element samples. The objectives were to investigate the elemental distribution and homogeneity of samples prior to TXRF analysis, to ensure that the use of an internal standard is valid and to improve quantification using external calibration. The issue of the effects of sample shape on analytical sensitivity of TXRF analyses was tackled in a second paper by Horntrich <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit235"><sup><span class="sup_ref">235</span></sup></a> The use of an external standard for calibration is prone to errors because the sample mass can, as discussed previously, affect the linearity of the calibration. The fluorescence intensity emitted by different theoretical sample shapes was calculated with several parameters, such as excitation energy, density and diameter/height ratio of the sample, all being taken into account. The ring shape appeared best because it led to the highest fluorescence intensity but also because it exhibited the lowest saturation effect (deviation from linearity with concentration). The third paper in this series, also by Horntrich <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit236"><sup><span class="sup_ref">236</span></sup></a> evaluated the effect of excitation energy on absorption effects during TXRF analyses. Vapour phase decomposition-droplet collection (VPD–DC) was used to collect different amounts of Ni on silicon wafers. The fluorescence intensities from the samples during TXRF analysis using two different excitation energies were then measured in an attempt to determine the upper limit of sample mass that could be used before the relationship between fluorescence intensity and sample mass deviates from linearity. The results obtained experimentally were compared with those obtained using a computer simulation model. If the excitation energy is close to the absorption edge of the excited element the saturation effect appears at a lower sample mass.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Dill and Rossiger<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit237"><sup><span class="sup_ref">237</span></sup></a> compared the performance of XRF spectrometry with different detector types (proportional counter, positive intrinsic negative and silicon drift) for the determination of <span class="italic">Au and Pd thickness measurements on printed circuit boards</span>. The aim was to provide a reference material for such samples. Other techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> RBS and gravimetric analysis, were also used for the certification. The instruments with the proportional counter detectors were not very suitable for the measurement of thin films because of their poor energy resolution. However, the systems with the semiconductor detectors provided results that were far more reliable and accurate. The composition of the base material had to be taken into account and so a variety of background correction systems were compared. A global base subtraction was performed and this led to better repeatability, but could also cause incorrect absolute values. When using the semiconductor-based detectors, the use of polycapillary optics during the analysis of small (∼150 μm) spots improved the sensitivity significantly.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Nanoscale defects in large area solar cells lead to decreased device efficiency and increased cost.

          <span>Lee and Lim<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239</span></sup></a> reported the <span class="italic">use of LA-ICP-MS</span> (using a SF instrument and a laser operating at 266 nm to ablate the samples) for the determination of Cu that had been deposited on a silicon wafer by ion sputtering. Unfortunately, there is a lack of suitable CRMs for this type of sample (semiconductors and solar cells). The authors therefore used NIST SRM 616 as a reference material. A desolvation nebulizer (operating at 160 °C) was used for the introduction of standard additions during the LA-ICP-MS process, where the aerosols from the nebulized standard and the ablated material were mixed using a Y-connector prior to entry to the plasma. Although this non-matrix matched approach would appear not to be ideal, it managed to minimize errors associated with fluctuation in particle generation, transportation and ionization. The results obtained were compared with those obtained using radial scanning. In this latter method, the deposited Cu atoms were dissolved using 1:50 diluted HF that had been deposited on the wafer surface by a fully automated, computer-controlled, radial scanning system and then sampled with the same device. It was necessary to estimate the weight of material ablated during the LA-ICP-MS process in order for accurate results to be obtained. Errors were encountered during the LA-ICP-MS procedure and these originated from the interaction of the laser beam with the surface material and this produced irregular craters and particles because of the unique physical properties of reflective index and hardness. In a paper by Pan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240</span></sup></a> LA-ICP-MS was used for the analysis of small-scale electronic components. Contamination of the components may lead to corrosion, current leakage or electro-chemical migration. Any one of these problems can lead to a device failure. The decrease in size of the components and the way that they are packed onto boards has meant that their analysis has become more difficult. The LA-ICP-MS analysis method enabled analysis of the materials with sufficiently good resolution to analyse individual components, yielding a method that enabled the source of the contamination and the root cause to be determined.</span>

            <span>Reviews in previous years have commented on how LA can be used to “drill” through the thin layers by repeat firing onto the same spot, with detection using ICP-MS or ICP-OES. This year is somewhat different with the <span class="italic">papers of interest being LIBS-based</span>. Mercadier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit244"><sup><span class="sup_ref">244</span></sup></a> used LIBS for the depth-profile analysis of samples made of tungsten–molybdenum or tungsten–carbon layers on titanium substrates. Laser pulses produced by a Nd:YAG laser at several different wavelengths (1064, 532, 355 and 266 nm) were used for the ablation. Also tested, were the effects of laser beam shaping and fluence as well as both the nature and pressure of the gas mixture inside the sample cell (with air, argon and helium all being used). The results of the depth-profiling were comparable to those obtained using GD-OES. However, it was noted that the LIBS technique led to a mixing of the layers and this was attributed to diffusion through the melted material and to non-homogeneity of the laser beam spatial distribution. The ablation depth increased with increasing laser wavelength. Similarly, the LIBS signal and the ablation depth also increased with laser fluence. A compromise had to be made, therefore, between increased depth resolution and sufficient LIBS signal. Argon was the most suitable surrounding gas since it limited signal fluctuations and enhanced the signal to noise ratio. Overall, the most accurate data were achieved using a wavelength of 355 nm, a fluence of 18 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and argon at a pressure of 1 atmosphere. The other paper of interest in this section was prepared by Yuan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> who used LIBS to determine the film thickness and elemental content of an aluminium zinc oxide film. Several Al and Zn atom lines were monitored to study the influence of the delay time, pulse energy, concentration of the elements and film thickness on signal intensity. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and with a pulse duration of 10 ns was used to irradiate the sample in an air environment at atmospheric pressure. Light emitted from the ablated sample was detected through a bundle of seven optical fibres using a linear CCD array detector. The pulse energy governed the temperature of the excited plasma and the intensity of the emission lines.</span>

A rf generator operating at 13.56 MHz in pulse mode (0.8 ms pulse width, 3 ms period and 27% duty cycle), with a constant power (45 W) and pressure (650 Pa) was used for the analysis. The instrument was used in dual beam mode, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the erosion and analysis beams were different (C<small><sub>60</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ions at 10 keV at an incidence angle of 45° and Bi<small><sup>+</sup></small> primary beam at 25 keV respectively). The data indicated that there was segregation of the Al and Co and that there was diffusion of the Co into the silicon substrate; the extent of which was dependent on the Co concentration in the AlCo layer. Results obtained for the depth-profiling were compared with those obtained using TOF-SIMS. In general, the results were in good agreement, although the TOF-SIMS had better depth resolution. The GD-TOF-MS was faster, had lower cost and did not require the ultra-high vacuum conditions required for SIMS.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">A new <span class="italic">μs pulsed GD assembly</span> using a fast flow high power source that was capable of time resolved measurements and of thin film analysis was described by Churchill <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit247"><sup><span class="sup_ref">247</span></sup></a> The impact of pulse width (over the range 12–75 μs), pulse voltage (600–1000 V) and argon flow rate (175–700 standard cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) on the glow current, matrix ion and argon ion intensities were evaluated.

A description of the fast flow source and of the pulse counting detector dead time and correction and automatic detector switching issues was also provided. The intensity of ions produced from the sample were directly proportional to the pulse voltage (as were the ions generated from the plasma itself), however, other ions of secondary origin, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, <small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small><span class="italic">etc.</span>, had no correlation. Very low carrier gas flow rates led to incomplete flushing of the sample plume to the detector before the next pulse arrived.

A paper similar in design to the one described above (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit248">ref. 248</a>) that discussed the effects of endogenous and exogenous hydrogen during the analysis of thin films was presented by Sanchez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> This application discussed the use of GD-OES as a means of detection rather than GD-TOF-MS. Using a pressure of 600 Pa and a power of 50 W, the other operating conditions were optimized for the analysis of both a conducting material and a silicon wafer. A 10 kHz and 25% duty cycle was optimal. Enhanced emission signals were observed for most analytes in the presence of hydrogen (especially for Si), even though the conditions used reduced the sputtering rate. A paper by Gamez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250</span></sup></a> highlighted how GD-OES has historically been regarded as being poor for laterally resolved analysis, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, it cannot easily be used to analyse the surface distribution of analytes.

The system developed enabled a much higher light throughput enabling faster acquisition times. However, it did have the disadvantage of suffering from distortions, some of which could be significant.

            <span>A large number of different X-ray based techniques are available to analysts specialising in the analysis of thin films and layered samples. It should be emphasized that many of the applications in this area report new and exciting materials but many of the techniques used to characterize them can be regarded as relatively routine and so will not be discussed further in this review.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">use of GI-XRF</span> is still attracting substantial attention because of its improved resolution. There was, however, less groundbreaking research published during this review period. Unterumsberger <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> used the complementary techniques of conventional XRF and GI-XRF for the characterization of buried boron-carbon layers with nominal thicknesses of 1, 3 and 5 nm. The techniques were compared with respect to quantification reliability and elemental sensitivity. Although the sensitivity and resolution were different, the techniques showed good agreement when the layers were characterized. Another paper to have used GI-XRF was presented by Torres <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252</span></sup></a> who also used XANES to investigate the electronic structure of zinc iron oxide thin films. During this study, the non-equilibrium cation site occupancy as a function of depth and oxygen pressure during deposition was monitored. Low deposition pressures (&lt;10<small><sup>−3</sup></small> mbar) led to Fe super-occupation of tetrahedral sites without Zn<small><sup>2+</sup></small> inversion. This resulted in an ordered magnetic phase with high room temperature magnetic moment.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">
              <span class="italic">Other grazing incidence techniques</span> have also been described. These included GI-SAXS spectrometry which was used in conjunction with XRF by Devloo-Casier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> to study the initial growth of hafnium dioxide thin films formed using atomic layer deposition with tetrakis(ethylmethylamino)hafnium and water on both oxidized and H-terminated silicon and germanium surfaces. The XRF spectrometry was used to quantify the amount of material deposited during each atomic layer deposition cycle and the GI-SAXS was used to monitor the film roughness. The XRF data showed that there was no inhibition period observed during film preparation when oxidized substrates were used, but that the H-terminated materials did exhibit one. A correlation between the inhibition period and the onset of surface roughness was identified. Grazing incidence X-ray reflectivity along with angular dependent XRF was used by Arac <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit254"><sup><span class="sup_ref">254</span></sup></a> to analyse the structural and compositional changes in nickel iron/gold bilayers induced by irradiation with a focussed 30 keV Ga<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam. A low dose (&lt;15.6 × 10<small><sup>14</sup></small> ions cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) had an influence on the interface of the two layers whereas at high dose sputtering of the surface and ion implantation was observed. In both cases, inter-mixing of the layers was observed. The authors confirmed the usefulness of the combined use of the techniques to study layer inter-mixing. High resolution grazing exit XRF using SR excitation and a high resolution detector was reported by Kayser <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit255"><sup><span class="sup_ref">255</span></sup></a> who described the depth-profile measurements of Al-implanted silicon wafers. The advantages of the technique were discussed and results indicated that results with nm scale precision could be achieved.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">An interesting paper by Yoshida and Sato<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a> described a new experimental <span class="italic">method of XPS that was capable of mapping core-energy levels as a function of depth</span> from the surface of the film. Layers (of thickness 5, 10 and 15 nm) of the organic semiconductor bathocuproine were deposited on polycrystalline metal surfaces at a rate of 1 nm min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The films then underwent XPS analysis using a magnesium K-α X-ray source and a detection angle of between 5 and 65°. By changing the detection angle, a series of XPS spectra could be obtained as a function of depth. The spectra at each depth were then analysed using the mathematical algorithm of Taylor expansion and the coefficients required for the core energy levels were determined using target factor analysis. The paper described the mathematics behind the analysis and further details were provided in an appendix. The overall result was that profiling of the interface between the semiconductor and the metal surface was achieved. The authors concluded that the technique could provide information on the electronic structures that existing methods have never accessed.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">There are two methods of depth-profile analysis available when using standard XRF instrumentation. One is the fundamental parameter method that uses multiple angle measurements and a mathematical algorithm to help calculate the concentrations at each depth. The other method is confocal XRF which uses an X-ray lens to excite the sample at a specific depth and a second lens to focus emitted X-rays to the detector. A paper by Gherase and Fleming<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> discussed a third option in which a portable XRF spectrometer was used with <span class="italic">a layered calibration method</span>. The approach required two assumptions to be made: X-ray attenuation properties of the unknown sample can be reproduced reliably by a layered phantom and that the elemental concentration values sampled at equally spaced depths can be related by a mathematical function. A single XRF measurement of the sample was required and the concentration present at each of the layers could be estimated using this one measurement, the slope of the calibration lines and an <span class="italic">a priori</span> knowledge of the concentration behaviour as a function of depth. As well as presenting the theory behind their approach, the authors also validated the protocol using 10 polyester disks (of 0.5 mm thickness and 35 mm diameter), some of which contained As at concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, whereas others contained no As. Four disks were then stacked together for analytical measurements. The approach was reported to work satisfactorily, but more accurate results were obtained using higher As concentrations. The advantages were that it circumvented the necessity for precise alignment of components as needed by the confocal method and also that it did not require the variable geometries required by the fundamental parameter method. In addition, only one measurement was required and so the exposure to ionizing radiation was minimal. The disadvantage, as mentioned previously, is that it required an <span class="italic">a priori</span> knowledge of the sample. The authors suggested that the approach could be of particular use for the determination of As and Se in skin samples, although this work has not yet been undertaken.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Another paper to rely on mathematical algorithms was prepared by Luhl <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit258"><sup><span class="sup_ref">258</span></sup></a> who <span class="italic">combined the use of 3D μ-XRF and conventional XAFS</span> to enable depth-profiled chemical speciation data to be obtained. The exciting X-ray beam was focussed onto the stratified sample (layers of copper foil, laquered copper(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) oxide and copper(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) oxide) using a polycapillary half lens, and the emitted X-rays were focussed using a second polycapillary half lens to the detector. The measurements were collected in fluorescence mode and this led to distortions of the spectra caused by absorption effects. A reliable algorithm was therefore constructed to calculate the attenuation coefficients of the analyte in order to overcome this distortion. The result was a new spectroscopic tool for three-dimensionally resolved, non-destructive chemical speciation.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Several <span class="italic">other papers were reported that used different X-ray methods.</span> This included one by Mainz and Klenk<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a> who used synchrotron XRF and EDXRD simultaneously to investigate the synthesis of copper indium sulfide thin films using the copper–indium precursors and then annealing in a sulfur-rich atmosphere. The EDXRD monitored the time evolution of the phases whereas the synchrotron XRF spectrometry measured the relative concentrations of the analytes in each phase. Another example is a paper presented by Vrielink <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260</span></sup></a> who compared the usefulness of XRF depth-profiling with profilometry and with images taken using SEM. In general, film thickness results obtained using the different techniques were in good agreement but the XRF did not suffer the drawbacks of being affected by different thicknesses or hardness of the different metal layers. It also enabled discrimination between different sub-layers in multi-layered films, density estimations to be made and, in addition, it enabled compositional analysis.</p>

After bombardment, the surface was examined using AFM. The formation of ripples perpendicular to the direction of the ion beam was observed and their wavelength and the roughness caused were evaluated as a function of different ion flux (over the range 1 × 10<small><sup>14</sup></small> to 1 × 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> ions per cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>) and fluence at a constant flux of 1.0 × 10<small><sup>14</sup></small> (7 × 10<small><sup>14</sup></small> to 1.5 × 10<small><sup>18</sup></small> ions per cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>, corresponding to sputtering times of between 7 s and 7500 s). Both the roughness and the wavelength of the ripples increased with increasing ion fluence, whereas the ion flux showed little effect. Sample rotation had a profound effect on the formation of ripples, which ceased to be formed, and surface roughness, which decreased significantly.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">storing matter technique</span> was developed recently as a means of overcoming matrix effects that can be encountered during SIMS analyses. After bombardment with a focussed ion beam, the emitted material is collected as a monolayer on a virgin, well-characterized collector material. Since the collector constantly rotates, different layers of original sample will be collected on different areas of the collector. Analysis of the material on the collector using SIMS is then undertaken and, since the collector material is well-characterized, it gives a constant background signal which may easily be subtracted from that obtained from the different layers of the sample material. Mansilla and Wirtz<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit262"><sup><span class="sup_ref">262</span></sup></a> described the use of this technique for the characterization of boron-doped and boron-implanted silica/silicon. The materials were first sputtered onto the collector (a polished germanium wafer) using an argon ion beam (at 10 keV and with an ion flux of 10<small><sup>14</sup></small> ions per cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> s). Low energy O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> (at 1 keV and at an angle of 61°) was then used as the primary ion beam during SIMS analysis of the material on the collector. Results obtained were compared with those obtained using standard SIMS (under the operating conditions of an O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> primary ion beam at an energy of 3 keV and at an angle of 63°). The standard SIMS analysis suffered from interferences (especially at the near-surface layers), whereas the storing matter-SIMS analysis did not. The concentration of <small><sup>11</sup></small>B at a depth of 130 nm was 40% using traditional SIMS whereas the storing matter technique of SIMS found a concentration of 37% at a depth of 131 nm. The FWHM value was also very different for the storage matter technique, being 170 nm compared with the 140 nm for traditional SIMS.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Demenev <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> described the combined use of <span class="italic">ultra-low energy SIMS</span> and MEIS for the analysis of arsenic shallow implants in silicon. The depth resolution of MEIS (&lt;1 nm) is far superior to that obtained using SIMS, but it suffers from relatively poor sensitivity. The SIMS analysis was achieved using a Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> primary ion beam of 300 eV and at an angle of 45° with the negative ions <small><sup>18</sup></small>O<small><sup>−</sup></small>, <small><sup>30</sup></small>Si<small><sup>−</sup></small> and <small><sup>28</sup></small>Si<small><sup>75</sup></small>As<small><sup>−</sup></small> being detected. The MEIS operating conditions were obtained using a 100 keV He<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam in double alignment configuration. The data obtained using SIMS could be aligned with the high resolution data obtained using MEIS providing a powerful approach to the calibration correction of SIMS profiles.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The method of <span class="italic">extended full spectrum TOF-SIMS</span> was described in two papers by Py <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264,265</span></sup></a> Both SIMS and TOF-SIMS can suffer from non-linearity of relative sensitivity factors when profiling through films with various compositions and this can especially be the case when the material under investigation is silicon germanide layers on silica. The use of the extended full spectrum method helps minimize these interferences. One study (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264">ref. 264</a>) described its use during the quantitative depth-profiling of both matrix elements (Ge, O and Si) and of contaminants (C) in Si(0.82)Ge(0.16)C(0.02) materials annealed in an oxidizing atmosphere. The accuracy and precision of the data obtained using the method were compared with those obtained using another technique (conventional SIMS) and were both superior, even under the optimal SIMS operating conditions. Depth resolution and signal to noise ratio were also improved. The improvements in performance were most marked at the interface regions, which enabled better understanding of the behaviour of the material under oxidizing anneal conditions. This, in turn would allow the fabrication of well-controlled materials.</p>

          <span>Several <span class="italic">reviews</span> have been prepared. Many of these are either technique-specific or have focused on a particular topic, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, the analysis of cultural heritage samples. One review, by Koch and Gunther<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> and containing 40 references, discussed the state of the art of LA-ICP-MS. Basic principles and recent developments were addressed, with particular focus on the aerosol formation/transport process, quantification issues and the technical aspects concerning the system configuration and ICP operating conditions. In addition, the benefits that have been discovered in recent years of femtosecond laser pulses were also discussed. These were illustrated by a comparison with nanosecond laser sources during the analysis of oxide layer and silicate glass analysis. Another review prepared by Mando <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit268"><sup><span class="sup_ref">268</span></sup></a> discussed (with the aid of 38 references) the present role of small particle accelerators for the study of objects with cultural heritage. The pros and cons of the small particle accelerators compared with other techniques were discussed. The techniques can be used for elemental mapping and to resolve layer structures. The technique of AMS is unique in that it can perform radiocarbon dating in a sensitive, precise and quasi-non-destructive way. Prospects for further improvement were also discussed. A review with 116 references by Bertrand <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> discussed the analysis of cultural heritage and archaeological materials by synchrotron spectroscopy and imaging. The authors pointed out that the use of such instrumentation to analyse a wide variety of sample types, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, painting materials, glass, ceramics, stone, metals, wooden materials <span class="italic">etc.</span>, has increased rapidly over the last 10–15 years. Techniques discussed in this review included XRF, XAS and XRD. The techniques were reviewed in terms of the recent work published, but it also discussed the possible future trends offered by the third generation synchrotron techniques. Areas of investigation covered included the use of XAS to study corrosion effects and alteration by determining elemental speciation in a non-destructive way; elucidation of the technologies of the time through analysis of the raw materials and current methodologies for restoration and stabilization of samples. Finally, a review by Kanngiesser <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit270"><sup><span class="sup_ref">270</span></sup></a> discussed (with 71 references) the use of confocal μ-X-ray spectroscopy for depth resolved elemental analysis. The techniques of XRF and PIXE were both discussed in the review. The authors stated that they could be used for the analysis of bulk and of simple layered samples, but that the techniques do not have high resolving powers for mapping three dimensional heterogeneities. This is, according to the authors, because of the fixed geometries and excitation energies used. However, these difficulties have largely been overcome recently by the use of microprobes with a confocal geometry. The review presented a summary of the experimental set-up developments, particle accelerators and desktop spectrometers that have driven the methodological developments. Also discussed was the use of confocal XANES spectroscopy which can be used for depth-profiling speciation studies. Applications of the techniques, their limitations and future perspectives were given.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">development of CRMs</span> is necessary whatever the sample type to ensure that valid data are being produced. This review period has seen a number of papers re-visiting the analysis of CRMs in an attempt to either re-certify them or to ensure that the data obtained in the first instance were correct. A series of CRMs (four materials labelled A, B, C and D) that have been designed to simulate archaeological glasses have been re-analysed by Wagner <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> who used ICP-MS to analyse the materials with sample introduction using either a nanosecond pulse duration LA system (at 193 or 266 nm) or a femtosecond system (at 800 nm). The concentrations of 26 analytes were determined and the data obtained were compared with values found in the literature. Numerous discrepancies were found, the largest of which was for Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> in material A, Li<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, B<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> in material B and MnO, Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small>, Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and Bi<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> in material C. In general, the data obtained during the analysis of material D were in closest agreement with certified values, but even then, significant deviances were observed. A similar paper, by Jochum <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272</span></sup></a> re-analysed the NIST materials SRM 610 to SRM 617. The analysis of the materials was undertaken according to the ISO guidelines and the protocol recommended by the International Association of Geoanalysts. Data quality was checked by the application of the Horwitz function and by careful investigation of the analytical procedures. Elemental inhomogeneities were identified when different test portion masses (1, 0.1 and 0.02 μg) were analysed. These included moderate inhomogeneities of several chalcophile/siderophile elements and gross inhomogeneities of Ni, Pd, Pt and Se at small test portion masses. In general, the results were in agreement with certified values (with the exception of Mn in NIST SRM 610).</p>

          <span>Two papers have discussed the <span class="italic">use of LIBS</span> for the analysis of glass materials. The first, by Jung <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273</span></sup></a> reported the quantitative determination of Eu and U in glass samples containing U and Eu as surrogate materials for highly radioactive glass waste materials. The emission spectra were recorded using an Echelle spectrometer that functioned over the wavelength range 200 to 780 nm. The analytes were determined at 358.488 nm for U and at 459.403 nm for Eu. Limits of detection were 150 and 4.2 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for U and Eu respectively. The second LIBS application described the use of a mobile system for the analysis of molten glass.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit274"><sup><span class="sup_ref">274</span></sup></a> The paper, by Matiaske <span class="italic">et al.</span>, investigated its capabilities as a process analytical technique for the recovery of metals from molten inorganic wastes and described the optimization of the procedure in terms of the number of laser shots, laser inter-pulse and acquisition delay times. Both solid and liquid (at 1200 °C) glass samples were analysed. Under optimal conditions, with double pulse LIBS being used at a distance of 75 cm from the sample, LOD ranging from 7 ppm (Mn) to 194 ppm (Zn) were obtained.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Laser ablation</span> was the most commonly used of the laser-based techniques in this review period. Konz <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit275"><sup><span class="sup_ref">275</span></sup></a> used LA as a means of sample introduction to a double focussing, SF ICP-MS instrument in an attempt to identify local defects in glasses coated with metallic and oxide films in the low nm range. The low LOD and high mass-resolving power of the instrument enabled the analytes P, S and Cl to be determined; which are analytes that, under normal circumstances, suffer from severe polyatomic interferences (from <small><sup>15</sup></small>N<small><sup>16</sup></small>P<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small><span class="italic">etc.</span>). The data was sufficiently accurate to enable the authors to identify three different types of defect, which were characterized by the impurities identified. This enabled the authors to identify, unambiguously, the contamination source that produced the defects. A paper by Weis <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276</span></sup></a> described the use of LA-ICP-MS to prove (or disprove) the common origin of two or more sources of glass. This forensic application was optimized to give very low rates of both false negative errors and false positive errors. Two sets of float glass (fragments from the same pane in one set and fragments originating from different float glass of global origin in the other) were analysed for 18 analytes and the analytical data tested using different statistical methods. The best match was achieved using a modified four sigma match criterion based on fixed RSD or, using <span class="italic">t</span>-tests modified analogously by applying the same fixed RSD. The overall protocol was reported to have been used successfully in over 70 court cases. High spatial resolution trace elemental analysis, using LA-ICP-MS with an ablation cell designed for multiple or large samples, was reported by Fricker <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit277"><sup><span class="sup_ref">277</span></sup></a> The dimensions of the cell were 230 × 34 × 16 mm. The performance of the cell was tested using the CRMs NIST SRM 610 glass and JK-2D steel. To obtain high spatial resolution, the cell must enable a rapid removal of the aerosol to ensure that particles produced from different laser pulses of material from different locations do not mix. The gas flow patterns within the cell were modelled using computational fluid dynamics. Therefore, despite the increased size of the cell, rapid removal of the aerosol was achieved, with a washout time of 2.6 s being required to remove 99.9% of the signal. This represented a 70% improvement on the cell used previously by these workers.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">It has been known for some time that the presence of <span class="italic">carbon in the plasma increases the sensitivity</span> of some analytes during ICP-MS determinations. A paper by Fliegel <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit278"><sup><span class="sup_ref">278</span></sup></a> described how this was extended to the use of carbon in the form of methane–argon or methanol–water, to the LA-ICP-MS determination of several analytes. Addition of methane at a rate of between 0.6 and 1.4 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> during the ablation of NIST SRM 610 glass led to a sensitivity increase by at least a factor of two, but for select elements (As, I, Se and Te) the increase was by an order of magnitude. Introduction of the carbon in the form of a methanol/water mixture through the cooled spray chamber of the instrument with the simultaneous introduction of the laser ablated material led to sensitivity increases of up to 20 fold. The buildup of carbon on the interface cones which can lead to signal drift and inaccuracy was avoided by use of a fast cleaning procedure.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An interesting paper by Douglas <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit279"><sup><span class="sup_ref">279</span></sup></a> described the <span class="italic">new technique of LASIL</span>. In this technique a micro-droplet (25 μL) is dispensed onto the surface of a material and the laser ablates the material into the droplet. The particulate matter within the droplet can then be analysed either on-line directly or off-line using aqueous calibration standards. The authors described their technique as robust and easy to implement. It also enabled containment of the ablated particles, eased the generation of suspended solids in solution from insoluble materials and allowed easy control over the dissolution and dilution to obtain measurable concentrations of analyte. The authors demonstrated the use of their technique using the CRM NIST SRM 610. The particle size distribution and the shapes of the particles produced were investigated and were found to vary with laser fluence; with higher fluence producing wider particle size distributions with particles also being irregular in shape. Several types of particle were found. These included jagged particles of 1–2 μm in diameter (which the authors stated were produced by micro-jet impingement), spherical nanometer-sized particles (from vapour condensation melt ejection) and thin, string-like particles produced by particle agglomeration or liquid jet fragmentation. Lower laser fluences tended to lead to the spherical particulates being formed. The small size of these particles (typically 250 nm) ensured that the particulates had a very slow settling rate once in the liquid. This enabled the samples to be stable, even over a time period of several days.</p>

          <span>
            <span class="italic">Ceramics</span> are a class of materials that are difficult to dissolve/digest. They are resistant to many acid attacks, they are very resistant to heat and some of them have very high measurements of hardness. As such, very powerful acid attacks, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, those using hydrofluoric acid, or other, extremely time-consuming or hazardous methods are often used to bring them into solution. Significant research is therefore on-going enabling the analysis of the materials directly using solid sampling techniques. There are several of these that may be used, the most common of which are laser-based or XRF-based techniques.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Several applications have been described that have used <span class="italic">lasers as a means of solid sampling</span>. A paper by Wagner and Jedral<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit282"><sup><span class="sup_ref">282</span></sup></a> reported the use of LA-ICP-MS with an open ablation cell for the analysis of historic objects. Cell volumes of 60, 9 and 4.5 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> were tested and the open cells had aerosol rinse-out times that were shorter by a factor of three compared with standard cells. The systems were tested on both glass and ceramic objects, with validation achieved by using the NIST SRMs 610 glass and SRM 679 brick clay in the form of a pressed pellet. The technique of LA-ICP-MS was also used by Zaoralkova <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit294"><sup><span class="sup_ref">294</span></sup></a> (along with LA-ICP-OES and EPMA) to investigate multi-layered silicate ceramics. Single spot laser drilling using a Nd; YAG laser operating at 1064 nm gave a spot diameter of 1 mm. The detection system used for this was ICP-OES. Transverse scans across the surface using an ArF laser (operating at 193 nm) and with detection using ICP-MS were also performed. The results for LA-ICP-OES and LA-ICP-MS were verified using EPMA and two dimensional back-scattered electron images. The LA-ICP-OES system was less dependent on sample surface and layer irregularities, but the small laser spot size produced during the LA-ICP-MS enabled an insight into the micro-morphology of the individual layer.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several authors have reported the use <span class="italic">of LIBS for ceramics analysis</span>. Cowpe <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit295"><sup><span class="sup_ref">295</span></sup></a> discussed the use of LIBS for the determination of hardness of bio-ceramics. The relationship between the sample's hardness and the LIBS plasma properties were investigated. Measuring the plasma excitation temperature, by monitoring the line to continuum ratio of the Si 288.16 nm line, enabled a linear relationship between hardness and plasma temperature to be noted. The results were compared with conventional Vickers hardness measurements and offered greater reproducibility than the standard method. A portable LIBS instrument was designed and constructed by ElSayed <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit296"><sup><span class="sup_ref">296</span></sup></a> and then applied to the analysis of archaeological pottery samples. A passive, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm was used with a pulse width of 20–30 ns and with between one and 6 pulses per laser shot. Total output energy of the system was 170 mJ and the entire duration of the output pulse train was less than 300 μs. The multi-pulse nature of the laser shots enhanced the LIBS signal. Another paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297</span></sup></a> described the use of collinear double pulse LIBS for the trace element determination (Al, B, Ca, Cr, Cu, K, Mn, Ni, Si and Ti) in sintered iron oxide ceramics. A Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm and with a 6 ns pulse duration was used to ablate the material and to form the plasma, whilst the spectra produced by the samples were recorded using an Echelle spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD detector. Atomic and ionic emission intensities were measured for different inter-pulse delay times (between 100 ns and 50 μs) and gate delays after the second pulse. Similarly, the energy partition between the two pulses was also varied and the effects on signal intensity observed. The LIBS signals obtained using double pulse LIBS were higher than for the single pulse mode, but the extent of improvement was dependent on the inter-pulse delay time, the energy partition between the pulses and the spot size. Detection limits below 10 ppm were obtained for most of the analytes.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Chu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit222"><sup><span class="sup_ref">222</span></sup></a> described the use of an ArF laser for the multi-elemental analysis of ceramics (and polymers) using the technique of <span class="italic">laser induced fluorescence</span> (LIF). This paper was discussed in detail at the end of Section 3.1.3 and so the reader is referred to there for further information.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several other applications that were not laser-based have also been reported. Amberger <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> reported the direct determination of trace elements in boron carbide powders using <span class="italic">direct current arc atomic emission spectrometry.</span> Twelve analytes were determined in three well-characterized materials, with LOD between 0.2 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Mg) and 25 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Na) being obtained. Precision for nine replicate measurements of 5 ± 0.3 mg of material varied from 6.2 to 27% RSD (for Al and Cu respectively). Analysis of the CRM ERM (R)-ED102 yielded results within 89 and 116% of the accepted values. Other sample types analysed included aluminium oxide, boron nitride, silicon carbide, coal fly ash, graphite and obsidian rock.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">solid sampling method using ETAAS detection</span> was reported by de Mattos <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> who determined the analytes Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Sb and Zn in aluminium nitride powders. The instrument used featured an inverse-Zeeman effect background correction system that had a variable magnetic field which enabled measurements in two sensitivity modes. This led to a linear range spanning three orders of magnitude being obtained. The measurement sensitivity could be altered depending on the concentration of analyte present in the sample. Calibration was achieved using aqueous standards and no matrix modifier was necessary. Method validation was obtained by comparison of data with those obtained using instrumental and radiological NAA. With the exception of K, results between the different techniques were in good agreement; with no significant differences being observed at the 95% confidence level using the <span class="italic">t</span>-test. Limits of detection ranged from 0.05 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Zn) to 80 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Fe) and precision was typically better than 11% RSD. The proposed method enabled up to 10 measurements to be made per hour. A second method using ETAAS for the analysis of refractory samples (lithium niobate and bismuth tellurite) was reported by Gyorgy <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a> The objective of the study was to remove/diminish the memory and carry over effects of the refractory analytes Er, Nb and Nd. The cleaning step of a normal program was replaced with a halogenation cycle in which 20 μL of carbon tetrachloride was dispensed using a conventional autosampler, dried at 80 °C under an internal gas flow of 40 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> argon and the residue decomposed by fast furnace heating to approximately 2000 °C under interrupted internal flow gas conditions. A clean out stage at 2100 °C then followed using the maximum gas flow. The technique had the advantage of not requiring any modification of the gas supply system. One drawback noted was that the analytical sensitivity decreased. This was attributed to the accelerated rate of tube surface deterioration. This required the mathematical correction (re-sloping) of the calibration curves. Calibration curves were linear to 1.5 and 10 μmol mole<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Er and Nd respectively. Characteristic masses were 18 and 241 pg and LOD were 0.017 and 0.27 μmol mole<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Er and Nd respectively. Results were compared with those obtained using a conventional ETAAS method and were validated using the completely independent technique of XRF spectrometry. In general, data between the different techniques were in good agreement; especially for the Er.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Not quite all of the methods reported in the literature used solid sampling techniques. On occasions, the <span class="italic">dissolution of the sample</span> can have beneficial effects. Souza <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit301"><sup><span class="sup_ref">301</span></sup></a> described a method in which alumina (250 mg) was dissolved using HCl (5 mL), H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> (1.5 mL) and water (1.5 mL) with microwave assistance and then diluted to 20 mL. The aluminium in the digest was then precipitated by bubbling ammonia through it until the pH reached 8, (approximately 10 min). The analytes Ca, Fe, Ga, Na, Si and Zn were then determined using ICP-OES. The use of a multitude of internal standards was necessary to obtain precise and accurate results. The internal standards used were Be (for Fe), Dy (for Ga), In (for Zn), and Sc (for Na). The advantage of the procedure was the removal of aluminium from the sample, which reduced spectral interferences on other analytes. At very high concentrations the aluminium can react with the silicon of the torch forming aluminosilicates which drastically reduces torch lifetime. The removal of the aluminium therefore also prevented this. The method was validated by the successful analysis of NIST SRM 699.</p>

          <span>The reader is directed to the reviews discussed in Section 3.4.1, since they mainly focus on certain aspects of this type of analysis. A huge number of papers have been published in this area of research during this review period. Some are fairly routine and will not be discussed further. However, others that offer some novelty in terms of sample handling, instrumentation or data manipulation are worth discussing in more detail. These are summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>. In common with the analysis of glass objects of similar type, the novelty comes through the use of techniques that cause minimal damage. As explained in Section 3.3.3, as the use of portable XRF becomes more routine, the novelty value will diminish and this area of research may be dropped from the review.</span>

          <span>In response to environmental and clean fuel legislation limiting S content of fuels to ultra-low levels (&lt;10 ppm), a number of studies have focused on the production of effective catalysts for the <span class="italic">hydrodesulfurization of petroleum streams</span>. Alkyl-substituted dibenzothiophene compounds are thought to be one of the most difficult fractions to treat because of the steric hindrance of the reaction site. To overcome this, a phosphate modified cobalt–molybdenum–sulfur hexagonal mesoporous silica supported catalyst, which causes isomerization of the dibenzothiophene allowing access for desulfurization, was proposed by Nava <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit320"><sup><span class="sup_ref">320</span></sup></a> The authors characterized a series of phosphate loadings using TXRF spectrometry for bulk chemical analysis, XRD for crystal size measurements and <small><sup>31</sup></small>P NMR to determine the environment of incorporated P. However, the presence of significant amounts of paramagnetic Co(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) ions in close proximity to the P atoms caused a significant decrease in the relaxation time of P, resulting in peak broadening and shifting. To assist with the determination of P environments FTIR was also used. The band at 1102 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was ascribed to terminal P<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O bonds and at 710 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to P–O–P bonding. Phosphorus was incorporated in the mesoporous silica, forming medium strength PO<small><sub>4</sub></small> acid sites, which aided isomerization and desulfurization. The chemical state and surface composition of freshly sulfided catalysts were also studied using XPS. An alternative scheme of selective adsorption of dibenzothiophenes was discussed by Sarda <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit321"><sup><span class="sup_ref">321</span></sup></a> However, the only analytical aspect of the study reported was total S determination using XRF spectrometry.</span>

The signal at 11.92 KeV was assigned to cationic Au and higher energy signals to metallic Au. In the monometallic gold–silica catalyst the presence of metallic Au was clear in the spectra. However, the addition of Pd led to a noticeable shift of the Au L<small><sub>3</sub></small> edge resonance to a lower energy indicating fewer features of metallic Au in the catalyst, demonstrating electron interactions between the Pd and Au.
