      <h2 id="sect226"><span class="a_heading">Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>Earth's present temperate climate depends on the presence in the atmosphere of infrared-active gases which absorb thermal infrared radiation emitted from Earth's surface and re-emit much of this radiation in the downward direction, thereby increasing surface temperature over that which would obtain in the absence of these gases. This phenomenon, which is commonly denoted the greenhouse effect, is a well understood feature of Earth's climate system. It is well established also that the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has increased over the past 250 years and is continuing to increase, in large part as a consequence of <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="ChEBI Ontology link for: fossil fuel" href="javascript:popupOBO('CHEBI:35230','b810350j','http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=35230')">fossil fuel</a></span> <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: combustion" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001473','b810350j')">combustion</a></span> for energy production. It is widely accepted, on the basis of theoretical understanding and much observational evidence, that Earth's climate has changed as a consequence of increases in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and other atmospheric constituents over the industrial period, and that continued climate change may be expected in the future as a consequence of future emissions. A comprehensive review of research pertinent to climate change is provided by the several recent (2007) assessment reports<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–4</span></sup></a> of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 (along with former US Vice-President Al Gore) for its work in documenting climate change, the science that has been conducted to characterize climate change and to understand the controlling processes, and approaches to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Despite extensive research, however, major uncertainties remain in the quantitative relations between changes in atmospheric composition and climate change.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Climate change and its relation to controlling factors such as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are of great consequence to the inhabitants of Earth and their governments in large part because of the intrinsic connection between increased amounts of atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and production of energy from <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: combustion" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001473','b810350j')">combustion</a></span> of <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="ChEBI Ontology link for: fossil fuels" href="javascript:popupOBO('CHEBI:35230','b810350j','http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=35230')">fossil fuels</a></span>. Thus planning for the ways in which the nations of the world will meet their energy requirements is dependent on knowledge of the climatic consequences of alternative energy and emissions strategies. However, present uncertainties in prospective climate change that would result from a given change in atmospheric composition limit effective planning.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Climate and climate change can be characterized in many ways—temperature: annual mean (spatially, globally), seasonal variation, diurnal range; hydrological cycle: evapotranspiration, <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span> (local, seasonal, episodic), snow and ice cover; and further ramifications involving the biosphere. However, the single key index of climate change, and perhaps the best quantified and understood measure of climate change, is the change in annual and global mean near-surface air temperature. Specifically, for characterization of temperature change the quantity that is most useful is the temperature anomaly, defined as the difference in temperature at a given observation site relative to a climatological mean temperature at that site over an arbitrary but suitably long period (the same for all sites). Expressing temperature change as change in temperature anomaly accounts for local differences in temperature due to altitude, proximity to large bodies of <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span>, and other local and regional climate-influencing geographical features. Temperature anomaly is shown to exhibit strong spatial coherence (autocorrelation distance of order 1000 km; <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5">ref. 5</a>), permitting confident spatial averaging, identification of outlier stations, and the like. Use of temperature anomaly makes it possible to speak confidently about changes in global mean surface temperature and the sensitivity of such changes to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other climate-influencing variables.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A major objective of current climate research is determination of Earth's climate sensitivity, the change in global mean surface temperature, GMST, that would result from a given sustained perturbation in Earth's radiation budget; in consideration of temperature changes over time, the “anomaly” can be disregarded as the climatological mean is the same for all times under consideration and thus cancels out. The underlying assumption in examination of Earth's climate sensitivity is that the equilibrium change in GMST Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>s</sub></small> that would result from a given change in a radiative flux component of Earth's climate system due to a given change in atmospheric composition or other radiation influencing component of the climate system (forcing, <span class="italic">F</span>) would be proportional to the forcing according to<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn1"/><span id="eqn1">Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>s</sub></small> = <span class="italic">SF</span>,</span></td><td class="rightEqn">(1)</td></tr></table>where <span class="italic">S</span> is the equilibrium sensitivity of the climate or often simply “climate sensitivity.” An inherent assumption of the forcing-response paradigm is that change in GMST is proportional to the imposed forcing and that forcings that are different in kind but equal in magnitude would effect equal change in GMST. Neither of these assumptions appears to be strictly correct. Earth's climate system is an inherently nonlinear, chaotic system, which in principle might exhibit large and/or apparently nondeterministic changes in response to small perturbations,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> as manifested, for example in the large swings between temperate and glacial periods that appear to have resulted from rather small triggering forcings. Additionally, one might expect departures from linearity due to second-order effects, such as melting of ice sheets increasing the absorption of solar radiation. Thus the climate sensitivity might be thought of as the derivative <span class="italic">S</span> = dΔ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>s</sub></small>/d<span class="italic">F</span> evaluated at some initial climate state, but which might vary with change in climate state. Experiments with climate models suggest an approximate linearity between forcing and change in GMST at least for small changes in GMST that would support the use of climate sensitivity to estimate the magnitude of future change of GMST that would result from a sustained forcing, albeit with the caveat that sensitivity might itself change as GMST changes (non-zero second derivative). Climate model studies suggest as well that the changes in GMST for forcings of differing nature (different greenhouse gases, aerosols) are similar (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1">ref. 1</a>, § 2.8.4–5). It might be noted that the climate sensitivity, as defined, would not encompass feedbacks on the forcing itself, such as a change in uptake of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> by vegetation with change in GMST that would effectively change the forcing per emitted CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">While the emphasis of the present paper is on climate sensitivity of the planet as a whole, that is, the change in global mean surface temperature that would result from a given sustained forcing, this emphasis should not be taken to mean that the change in temperature resulting from a given forcing would be expected to be spatially (or seasonally) uniform. Both observations and climate model studies suggest that sensitivity at high latitudes (especially in the Northern Hemisphere) to forcing from spatially uniform increments of greenhouse gas <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: mixing" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001685','b810350j')">mixing</a></span> ratios may be substantially greater than the global average sensitivity.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,7</span></sup></a> There is also substantial uncertainty in climate sensitivity in the tropics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> The spatial distribution of temperature change in response to spatially nonuniform forcings, such as by atmospheric aerosols, which are concentrated mainly in industrial regions of the Northern Hemisphere, is indicated in model studies to be nonuniform, greatest in regions where the forcing is greatest,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8,9</span></sup></a> consistent with the spatial distribution of observed temperature change over the twentieth century.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> Considerations such as these certainly limit the applicability of global climate sensitivity as a predictor of change in average temperature at any given location.

      <p class="otherpara">Because of historical precedent Earth's climate sensitivity is commonly expressed as a change in GMST that would result from a doubling of the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in Earth's atmosphere Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small>, but as discussed below, in view of uncertainty associated with the change in flux that would result from a doubling of atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, climate sensitivity might better be expressed simply as change in GMST that would result from a given change in a specified radiative flux component, normalized to that change; the unit for this sensitivity would be K/(W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) or equivalently K W<small><sup>−1</sup></small>m<small><sup>2</sup></small>.

      <p class="otherpara">In view of the importance of Earth's climate sensitivity to formulating energy policy and more broadly to understanding climate and climate change generally, there has been substantial effort to determine this quantity over an extended period, as reflected in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>.

      <span>Examination of the consequences of a perturbation to Earth's radiation budget is usefully informed by consideration of the overall radiation budget that drives Earth's climate system, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>, which provides context for any perturbation. Earth's climate system consists of a delicate balance between absorbed incident solar (shortwave) radiation and emitted thermal infrared (longwave) radiation. From this perspective, Earth is in near radiative “equilibrium” or steady-state. Average incoming solar irradiance is about 343 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, one-fourth of the solar constant, the factor of 4 accounting for the area of the planet relative to that of the subtended disk. The fraction of this incoming shortwave irradiance that is reflected or scattered is denoted the planetary albedo <span class="italic">α</span> (so-called “Bond albedo,” the average fraction of shortwave radiation that is reflected by the entire illuminated hemisphere). This albedo is not known <span class="italic">a priori</span> but must be measured; measurements from satellites have established <span class="italic">α</span> to be about 30% (0.293 ± 0.010, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22">ref. 22</a>). Clouds are a major contributor to shortwave reflectance; other contributions include the surface, Rayleigh scattering from air, and scattering by aerosol particles (microscopic and submicroscopic particles suspended in the air). The complement of this incident energy is absorbed by the Earth (including the atmosphere). To a very good approximation, Earth's energy budget is balanced, so the absorbed shortwave energy is emitted to space as longwave infrared radiation.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">As a consequence of absorption of solar radiation the land and oceans are warmed and emit longwave infrared radiation.

The right-hand axis of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a> gives the calculated increase in the downwelling longwave irradiance from the atmosphere to the surface due to the increase in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> over the industrial period, reaching about 1.6 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> by the year 2000. It is this forcing, together with comparable but lesser forcings due to increases in other greenhouse gases, that constitutes the anthropogenic enhancement of Earth's natural greenhouse effect that is the basis for the present concern over climate change. Comparison with the natural greenhouse effect of about 300 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>) shows that this enhancement is well less than 1%. Thus the question naturally arises whether such a slight change could give rise to climate change whose magnitude would be of any appreciable concern. From <a title="" href="#eqn1">eqn (1)</a>, for values of sensitivity (as given by <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1">ref. 1</a> with <span class="italic">F</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> 3.7 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) 0.54 to 1.21 K W<small><sup>−1</sup></small>m<small><sup>2</sup></small>, the resultant temperature increase is calculated as 0.86 to 1.94 K. Such a temperature increase from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> alone is comparable to the range of concern noted above. Comparison of the enhanced greenhouse forcing of incremental CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> compared to the natural greenhouse effect also reveals a major source of the difficulty associated with determining the climate change due to incremental CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, namely that the climate system must be understood sufficiently well that the effect of an increase of less than one percent in global mean downwelling longwave irradiance, itself a quantity that is highly variable spatially and temporally, can be determined with sufficient accuracy and confidence that this determination can be useful in formulating strategies to control climate change.

Changes in surface albedo due to land-use changes and due to black carbon (soot) on snow are thought to induce slight forcings in the shortwave. The next important class of forcings is that due to anthropogenic tropospheric (lower atmosphere) aerosols. Anthropogenic aerosols scatter light, effectively increasing Earth's albedo, and absorb light, decreasing albedo if the aerosols are above bright surfaces such as snow or clouds; light scattering dominates, so the net effect is a cooling influence or negative forcing, denoted direct aerosol forcing. Aerosol particles also serve as the seed particles for cloud droplet formation (cloud condensation nuclei, CCN); other things being equal, a greater number concentration of aerosol particles results in a greater concentration of cloud droplets and in turn in enhanced multiple scattering within the cloud and a resultant increase in cloud albedo, a further cooling forcing, denoted indirect aerosol forcing. Both of these effects are highly uncertain; the light blue bar and associated I-beam have been added to the figure to represent the total aerosol forcing and associated uncertainty. The uncertainty associated with the aerosol forcing is the dominant uncertainty of the several forcings.</p>

Several investigators<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27–30</span></sup></a> have suggested that further increase in temperature beyond that realized thus far might be expected in response to forcing due to changes in atmospheric composition that have already occurred—so-called “unrealized” or “committed” warming, or warming that is “in the pipeline” and whose delay in being realized is attributed to “thermal inertia”. Such additional temperature increase would result in an equilibrium sensitivity that is greater than the values just presented; the question of such committed warming is examined further below. However irrespective of that question, it is clear the multiplicative uncertainty of a factor of 4 in climate forcing over the industrial period greatly limits the ability to empirically infer climate sensitivity by this approach.

      <span>Global climate models, GCMs, are sets of difference equations representing the properties and processes that comprise Earth's climate system: transfer, scattering, reflection absorption, and emission of short- and longwave radiation; horizontal and vertical transport of air and <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span> and their heat content (and in the air, water vapor and clouds), <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: evaporation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001574','b810350j')">evaporation</a></span> and condensation of <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span>, <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span>, and the like under the constraints of conservation of matter, energy, and momentum that are solved through computer-intensive forward finite-difference treatment from specified initial conditions. While the acronym GCM originally referred to a general circulation model of the global atmosphere or the global ocean, it now refers more generally to coupled atmosphere–ocean global climate models. Global climate models are viewed as the principal tool by which climate scientists and policymakers can determine the consequences of alternative prospective future scenarios of emissions of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and changes in other influences on Earth's climate. A key challenge of global climate modeling is determining the consequence of small perturbations in Earth's radiative balance. GCMs must represent current climate with sufficient accuracy and fidelity that changes resulting from small perturbations can be calculated with an accuracy that is useful for effectively developing energy strategies.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">In principle, the underlying physics that must be represented in a global climate model is considered well understood; however, in practice the wide variety of scales of important processes that must be represented in the model—from submicrometre, for aerosol and cloud processes, to thousands of kilometres for large-scale circulations—makes it computationally impossible to solve the finite difference equations on global scales with the accuracy and precision that would characterize solving the fluid flow problem, say, for an airfoil, for which grid sizes may be made sufficiently small to guarantee accurate convergence. Consequently, fairly large grid sizes must be used in GCMs, typically about 100 km in the horizontal and 1 km in the vertical, with so-called sub-grid processes, physical processes on smaller scales and associated spatial inhomogeneities, being represented through parameterizations. Important subgrid processes involve transfer of short- and longwave radiation in inhomogeneous cloudy atmospheres, vertical transfer of air in up- and downdrafts and associated transfer of heat and <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span>, cloud formation and dissipation, and <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span> development. The need for parameterization also arises in describing the size distributions of cloud drops and aerosol particles, as clearly models are incapable of following the dynamics of individual drops or particles; for the most part even the size distributions are assumed, rather than evolved. A similar situation arises also in treating atmospheric radiation transfer, in which the highly structured wavelength dependence of molecular absorption features necessitates parameterized treatment. Thus, there is much skill involved in developing GCMs and much effort required to test them against observations on various temporal and spatial scales.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In addition to issues of parameterization of subgrid processes, there are important subgrid processes that are not well understood but which are thought to exert major influence on Earth's climate that must be represented in climate models. Key among these are the coalescence of cloud droplets to form <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span> and a variety of processes involving atmospheric aerosols as discussed below. Differences in treatment of these processes can lead to substantial differences in modeled climate sensitivity and to other changes in climate that would result from a given perturbation in atmospheric composition. Developing improved understanding of these processes continues to be a key objective of atmospheric science research.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Thus far no approach has emerged by which subgrid processes can be uniquely or optimally represented in GCMs. Consequently a situation has arisen in which some fifteen research groups globally are engaged in developing and testing more or less independent GCMs (or in some instances multiple models within the same group), the differences to great extent reflecting different approaches to representing subgrid processes involving radiation, clouds, and aerosols. Much effort has gone into evaluation of the accuracy of GCMs in reproducing Earth's present climate, especially temperature, cloudiness, and <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span> as a function of location and season. Accuracy in treatment of cloudiness and its latitudinal and seasonal dependence is especially important because of the importance of clouds in affecting short- and longwave radiation. As may be seen from <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>, a 10% error in treatment of clouds in the climate model would result an error of some 4.8 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Errors of comparable magnitude in longwave radiation can arise from errors in the vertical distribution of clouds. Errors in the seasonal or latitudinal dependence of cloudiness could similarly exert substantial influences on large scale circulations. Accurate representation of the seasonal and latitudinal dependence of clouds is also important because these dependences might serve as <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="ChEBI Ontology link for: indicators" href="javascript:popupOBO('CHEBI:47867','b810350j','http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=47867')">indicators</a></span> of how cloudiness and cloud properties might change in response to temperature change in a greenhouse warmed world affecting cloud feedbacks. A recent comparison, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7</a>, of shortwave albedo in 20 current climate models with satellite measurements shows major model-to-model differences in the seasonal and latitudinal dependence; these differences are due almost entirely to treatment of clouds in the models. The consequences of errors in modeled albedo of the magnitudes shown here can be substantial; for a mean incident shortwave flux at the top of the atmosphere of 243 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, an error in albedo as low as 0.01 results in an error in absorbed solar irradiance of 2.4 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. To some extent the error in absorbed shortwave energy is compensated in the longwave, but such compensation applies only to the total energy balance, and not to the vertical distribution of heating rate, which affects circulations on a variety of scales. Here it should be borne in mind that the quantities plotted are zonal monthly means; shorter term temporal and spatial (longitudinal) differences would be expected to be even greater.</p>

      <h2 id="sect795"><span class="a_heading">Climate sensitivity from global climate models</span></h2>
      <span>A major impetus for development of global climate models has been to examine the consequences of a given historical or assumed prospective change in atmospheric composition (or other influences on climate change such as change in surface albedo or evapotranspiration associated with land use changes). These consequences might be examined by running the climate model with and without the imposed changes sufficiently long to reach an equilibrium state, and sufficiently long to obtain accurate temporal statistics over multiple years, perhaps 30 to 100 or more. Often such models are run to equilibrium using only a mixed-layer ocean to decrease computer time needed to reach the new equilibrium, but with attendant concern over the accuracy of ocean temperature distribution and how errors might feed back into atmospheric circulation and other atmospheric properties. Alternatively the time-dependent coupled atmosphere–ocean equations might be solved, integrating the equations over a time period during which concentrations of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and other GHGs and aerosols are increased, to ascertain the time-dependent climate change. Central to evaluating the performance of climate models is to examine their performance over the twentieth century, for which there are reliable instrumental measurements against which to compare changes in temperature and <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span> to assess confidence in the model. Because of inherent variability both in Earth's actual climate and in modeled climate, it has become standard practice to run a given climate model multiple times with somewhat different initial conditions to obtain variability statistics necessary to assess model accuracy in comparison with observations—so-called ensemble runs. A major application of the models is to run them for future emissions scenarios to assess the consequences of different prospective future emissions, again perhaps as an ensemble of runs for each of the several models.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Because of differences in model formulations there is a substantial range in model sensitivities, as summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> for 18 current climate models. Attention is called to the multiplicative uncertainty, evaluated between the 5th and 95th percentiles, for the equilibrium sensitivity Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small>, 2.1. A slightly lower multiplicative uncertainty, 1.7, is indicated for the transient sensitivity. Transient sensitivity is determined by increasing the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>mixing ratio at 1% per year (compounded) so that by 70 years CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>mixing ratio has doubled; the transient sensitivity is evaluated as the average increase in GMST in years 60–80 relative to the initial temperature. Transient sensitivity defined and determined in this way is less than the equilibrium sensitivity because of time lag in reaching the new steady-state climate. Transient sensitivity is thought to be a more accurate measure of climate system response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases such as has occurred over the past century than equilibrium sensitivity. Time-dependent runs are sensitive to the representation of the role of ocean currents in latitudinal distribution of heating and transfer of heat to the deep ocean. The value and uncertainty range in modeled climate sensitivity are a major input to present assessments of Earth's climate sensitivity and uncertainty range reflected in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a> and <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">3</a> above. Understanding the reasons for the large model-to-model differences in sensitivity may help identify where research efforts might most usefully be directed to reduce the uncertainty range attached to estimated climate sensitivity.</p>

These findings suggest that the effect of model-to-model variation in the value of <span class="italic">F</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> on reported model sensitivities might be avoided by expressing sensitivities in units of K W<small><sup>−1</sup></small>m<small><sup>2</sup></small> rather than as Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small>. Still, as the multiplicative uncertainty in <span class="italic">F</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> is well less than that in model sensitivities, uncertainty in <span class="italic">F</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> cannot be the major cause of model-to-model variation in sensitivity. Nonetheless, because of model-to-model differences in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> doubling forcing, expressing model sensitivity as the change in GMST normalized to a specified change in a radiative flux component, rather than change in GMST due to doubling of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, would seem to eliminate this contribution to model-to-model differences in sensitivity.</p>
    
    
      <h2 id="sect1024"><span class="a_heading">Performance of climate models over the twentieth century</span></h2>
      <span>Just as with the actual climate, perhaps the most important attribute of any GCM is its climate sensitivity, the equilibrium change in global mean surface temperature that would result from, and normalized to, a given change in a radiative flux component such as might result from increase in <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: mixing" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001685','b810350j')">mixing</a></span> ratio of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> or other GHGs or from increased amounts of atmospheric aerosols. The intent, of course, is that the model provides a representation of the climate sensitivity of Earth's climate system that is sufficiently accurate to be used with confidence in developing strategies for managing the planet's energy economy consonant with an acceptable degree of climate change. While climate sensitivity is by no means the only pertinent index of climate change, it is arguably the single most important such index for purposes of planning energy futures. Furthermore, this index, being a measure of global climate response, is arguably more likely than any other modeled quantity to be an accurate estimator of actual climate response. Appropriately, therefore, this quantity is the first quantity that is used to compare the response of a given model to forcings that are different in nature, for example response to forcings by different GHGs or between forcings by GHGs and aerosols; most models exhibit linearity in response to a given forcing and a sensitivity to different forcing agents that is the same within ± 20% or so (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1">ref. 1</a>, § 2.8.4–5). Sensitivity is also perhaps the key model attribute that is used to compare and contrast climate change calculated by different models.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">A key test of the accuracy with which climate models might be expected to determine future climate change that would result from for a given scenario of emissions or atmospheric composition (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>) is their ability to represent past climate change. An exercise was reported in the 2007 IPCC Working Group I Assessment<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> in which the results of 58 model runs obtained with 14 different GCMs were compared with observations of GMST anomalies over the twentieth century, for which there are instrumental measurements of high quality and spatial coverage over most of the planet (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8</a>); the study also reported the results of 19 model runs using 5 different models for natural forcings only. In the model runs conducted, each modeling group used its own representation of anthropogenic forcings over the modeled time period. As well, the simulations used models with different climate sensitivities and rates of ocean heat uptake. As seen in the figure, the model runs that did not include anthropogenic forcings did not exhibit the systematic increase in GMST that is characterized by the observations, but when anthropogenic forcings were included, the modeled temperature changes Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>s</sub></small> = 0.85 ± 0.25 K agreed fairly closely with the observations. This agreement led the IPCC Working Group to conclude that “simulations that incorporate anthropogenic forcings, including increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and the effects of aerosols, and that also incorporate natural external forcings, provide a consistent explanation of the observed temperature record” (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1">ref. 1</a>, § 9.1.4.2).</p>

While such a multiplicative uncertainty associated with the modeled increase in GMST is comparable to that characterizing the sensitivities of current GCMs (2.1 for equilibrium sensitivity; 1.7 for transient sensitivity; <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>), it is well less than the multiplicative uncertainty in total forcing, 4, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>. These multiplicative uncertainties suggest that if a single temporal profile of forcing were used in the suite of GCM calculations, the multiplicative uncertainty in modeled Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>s</sub></small> would be a factor of 1.7 to 2.1; in contrast, if a set of runs were carried out with a single GCM for the full range of forcings, the multiplicative uncertainty would be a factor of 4.

Schwartz <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> suggested that a possible explanation for this might be that the forcings employed in the model runs were anticorrelated with the sensitivities of the models; that is, that models with high sensitivities used low forcings and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.

It would thus seem that a more accurate picture of the ability to represent twentieth century climate with current climate models would be obtained by exercising each of the models over the uncertainty range of forcing and then examining the envelope of modeled change in GMST, and it seems likely that such a picture would indicate a much greater uncertainty than is indicated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

      <span>Clouds play a central role in Earth's climate system, and it is thus to be expected that modifications of cloud properties in conjunction with greenhouse warming would exert important feedbacks on the climate system affecting temperature sensitivity. Clouds reflect shortwave radiation and absorb and emit longwave radiation. Low clouds, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, stratus, are efficient shortwave reflectors, but because their temperatures are close to those of the surface, they do not exert a strong influence on longwave fluxes. In contrast, high clouds, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, cirrus, do not reflect much shortwave radiation but exert a strong influence on the longwave by absorbing and re-radiating terrestrial radiation that would otherwise escape to space. The aggregate clouds are shown, by satellite measurements, to exert a global average decrease in absorbed shortwave irradiance of 48 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and a decrease in emitted longwave radiance of 31 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Hence even a rather small error in the representation of clouds in the present climate can result in an error in radiative fluxes that is substantial in the context of flux changes associated with increases in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and other climate-forcing agents. The difficulty in representing clouds in GCMs has been noted above. Equally important in the context of determining Earth's climate sensitivity is the change in cloud properties that would result from a change in GMST that would either augment (positive feedback) or diminish (negative feedback) the temperature change resulting from the forcing by the increase in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> or other forcing agent.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">In view of the importance of clouds in the climate system much attention has been paid to the examination of the representation of clouds in climate models and to the assessment of cloud feedbacks in these models. As shown almost two decades ago,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> most of the then threefold variation in modeled climate sensitivity was attributable to differing parameterizations of clouds that resulted in different cloud feedbacks, changes in net short- or longwave radiation due to changes in cloud amount or properties with changing GMST. Despite much work in developing and testing cloud parameterizations in the intervening years, a strong variation of GCM sensitivity is still manifested in current climate models resulting from differences in cloud feedback strength, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10</a>. These differences in cloud feedbacks are not tuned in the models <span class="italic">per </span><span class="italic">se</span>, but result, rather, from differences in the treatment of the processes that govern the amount and properties of clouds and the dependence on properties of the climate system such as humidity, temperature lapse rate, and vertical velocities, that govern cloud properties and that co-vary with GMST. Understanding these processes and accurately parameterizing them in global-scale climate models remain major challenges to the atmospheric research and climate modeling communities.</p>

      <span>As noted above, accurate knowledge of radiative forcing of climate change is essential to evaluating the performance of climate models over the period for which there are reliable instrumental measurements. While there is confident knowledge of increases in the atmospheric mixing ratios of the long-lived GHGs from contemporary measurements or from ice cores, knowledge of aerosol forcing is much more uncertain, at present, and all the more so historically over the industrial period. Here the mechanisms of aerosol forcing are reviewed, the reasons for the uncertainty in aerosol forcing examined, and approaches to decreasing this uncertainty outlined.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Atmospheric aerosols influence Earth's radiation budget, directly and indirectly, in a variety of ways. They scatter and absorb short- and longwave radiation and serve as the seed particles on which cloud drops and cloud ice particles form (cloud condensation nuclei, CCN; ice forming nuclei, IFN). Consequently, enhancement of the amount of atmospheric aerosols and modification of their properties by human activities have the potential for modification of climate by modifying the amount and locus of absorption of shortwave radiation (aerosol direct forcings), the properties of clouds, affecting their reflectance and persistence (aerosol indirect forcings), and the nature and locus of <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span>.

      <p class="otherpara">As noted above, aerosols exhibit much greater spatial and temporal variability than greenhouse gases. Additionally, there is much heterogeneity in key aerosol properties that influence climate forcing: particle size, composition, and size-distributed composition, affecting light absorption and scattering, hygroscopic growth, and cloud nucleating ability; and particle morphology, affecting optical properties. In contrast to GHGs important aerosol properties affecting Earth's radiation budget evolve as a consequence of atmospheric processes. Removal processes are likewise highly variable in space and time, being governed mainly by <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span> for particles that are important contributors to radiative and cloud modifying effects. All of these differences make it much more difficult to characterize aerosol influences on radiation than is the case with greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Approaches to estimating aerosol influences on Earth's radiation budget are based on observations, model calculations, or both. Recognition of the importance of aerosol forcing has led to enhanced measurement programs, mainly by remote sensing from the surface<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> and satellites.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46,47</span></sup></a> Such remote sensing does not, however, immediately yield the aerosol properties needed to calculate forcing. Surface-based remote sensing yields an accurate measure of aerosol optical depth (column extinction attributable to aerosols) and, depending on the measurement approach, some measure of the angular distribution of light scattering necessary for calculating forcing, but forcing calculations still require assumptions on aerosol optical properties. Thus far as well, measurements are geographically quite limited, confined mainly to continental locations, and further question can be raised as to whether the networks are sufficiently dense to accurately account for strong spatial gradients. Satellite measurements provide much more spatial coverage, but retrievals are mainly limited to radiance, which must be converted, through a model-based approach, to irradiance. Satellite measurements are often limited to one or two overpasses a day, limiting and perhaps biasing estimates of diurnal variability, as from relative humidity, for example. Inevitably there are issues of estimating forcing in partly cloudy scenes. A more intrinsic limitation to the observation-based approach is the inability to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic contributions, although some headway can be made from consideration of the size distribution (smaller aerosol particles ascribed to anthropogenic sources), where the size distribution is inferred from the wavelength dependence of the extinction and scattering. Measurement-based inferences of aerosol indirect effects are quite limited.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Model-based approaches in principle afford the possibility of determining forcing by anthropogenic aerosols as the difference between irradiance calculated with the total aerosol and with natural aerosol only. The approach is based on representing the processes that govern the geographical and temporal distribution of aerosols and the pertinent chemical and microphysical properties required to calculate aerosol forcing. Achieving this in turn requires that these processes and their dependence on controlling variables such as precursor gas concentrations, atmospheric photochemistry, and aerosol microphysics, be understood and that these processes and their consequences be accurately represented in cloud models, radiation transfer models, and ultimately in climate models examining changes in Earth's climate over the industrial period. The pertinent processes are shown schematically in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12</a>. Aerosol particles are directly emitted as primary particles and are also formed secondarily by <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Molecular Process Ontology link for: oxidation" href="javascript:popupOBO('MOP:0000568','b810350j')">oxidation</a></span> of emitted gaseous precursors. The production of low-volatility materials in this way results in new particle formation and condensation onto existing particles. Aqueous-phase oxidation of gas-phase precursors within cloud droplets accretes additional mass onto existing particles but does not result in new particle formation. Particle composition and size distribution evolve by condensation and by surface and volume reactions and by coagulation. With increasing relative humidity, particles may accrete <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span> vapor by deliquescence and further hygroscopic growth; with decreasing relative humidity, <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span> is lost and ultimately particles may effloresce to the dry state. The uptake of <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span> increases particle size, affecting also the particle optical properties. During cloud formation some fraction of aerosol particles serve as cloud condensation nuclei by becoming activated, that is, overcoming a free-energy barrier to form cloud droplets. Within clouds interstitial particles can become attached to cloud droplets by diffusion, and activated particles are combined when cloud droplets collide and coalesce. Cloud droplets take up soluble gases which can react in solution to form nonvolatile products. If cloud droplets evaporate the nonvolatile material again becomes an aerosol, but with modified composition and size distribution; if the cloud precipitates the material is carried below the cloud and reaches the surface unless the precipitating drops completely evaporate. <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: Precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">Precipitation</a></span> development in warm clouds occurs by autoconversion–coalescence of cloud droplets to form drops that are sufficiently large to fall by gravitational settling, initiating <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span>.

      <p class="otherpara">While the processes governing aerosol properties can be reasonably delineated, understanding is not sufficiently advanced that the aerosol properties can be modeled with confidence, for several reasons. There remain substantial uncertainties in the emissions of anthropogenic and natural primary aerosols and precursor gases. Atmospheric transformation and removal processes are likewise uncertain. Representations of aerosol size distribution and size distributed composition are highly parameterized, and calculation of aerosol optical and cloud nucleating properties from these parameterized distributions is therefore model dependent. These uncertainties are to some extent revealed in intercomparisons of chemical transport models.

Only after confident understanding is gained of these processes can they be confidently represented in hemispheric or global-scale models to permit evaluation of aerosol effects. Calculating aerosol forcing over the twentieth century necessary to evaluate the performance of climate models over this time period requires knowledge of space- and time-dependent emissions. Ultimately it would seem that aerosol processes need to be modeled interactively in climate models in order to account for feedbacks whereby aerosol processes influence radiation and hydrology that affect evolution of the climate system. For all of these reasons developing the understanding of these aerosol processes and representing them in climate models must be seen as a major challenge to understanding climate change, to determining Earth's climate sensitivity, and more broadly to developing the capability of determining the multiple responses of Earth's climate to prospective changes in atmospheric composition.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In view of the large uncertainty associated with estimates of aerosol forcing by observations or by chemical transport modeling, an alternative approach, inferring aerosol forcing by difference between GHG forcing and total forcing that is consistent with observed temperature change and an assumed climate sensitivity (so-called inverse calculation<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit59"><sup><span class="sup_ref">59</span></sup></a>) has gained favor among some investigators and has generally led to estimates of global mean aerosol forcing that are substantially less (in magnitude) than estimates by calculations based on process modeling or that are rooted in observed aerosol concentrations, so-called forward calculations, as described above. While inverse calculations are useful to assess the aerosol forcing that would be consistent with a given climate sensitivity, it needs to be stressed that the use of a forcing obtained in this way to infer climate sensitivity would constitute circular reasoning.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60</span></sup></a></p>

There is strong theoretical reason to believe that this radiative forcing would result in an increase in GMST, and this expected increase in GMST is borne out by observation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its 2007 Assessment Report<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> concluded that warming of Earth's climate system is unequivocal, that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past fifty years can be explained without external forcing and very likely not due to known natural causes alone, and that continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The examination presented here of the uncertainty in Earth's climate sensitivity is in no way meant to call into question these main conclusions of the IPCC assessment report. Rather, the emphasis here has been on the uncertainty in the quantitative relation between forcing and climate system response, specifically, the change of global mean surface temperature per change in the emitted longwave flux or absorbed shortwave flux that control Earth's surface temperature and the energy balance of Earth's climate system: the magnitude of this uncertainty, the reasons that this uncertainty is so great at present, approaches to reduce this uncertainty, and consequences of this uncertainty. The IPCC Working Group characterized the magnitude of this uncertainty as the range of the estimate in temperature response for doubled CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small>, 2.0 to 4.5 K, with 66% probability of the actual value being within this range. Here it is argued that perhaps a more useful way of characterizing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity is as a multiplicative uncertainty, the ratio of the high end of the range to the low end, because such a multiplicative uncertainty immediately attaches to quantities that are proportional to the sensitivity. The multiplicative uncertainty that corresponds to the IPCC 66% likelihood range is thus a factor of 2.25; the arguments presented here suggest that the multiplicative uncertainty may actually be somewhat greater. Whatever the value of this uncertainty range, and uncertainties of highly uncertain quantities are inevitably difficult to characterize with great precision, it immediately attaches to the maximum incremental amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> that can be introduced into the atmosphere subject to a constraint on increasing GMST or equivalently, on the amount of <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="ChEBI Ontology link for: fossil fuel" href="javascript:popupOBO('CHEBI:35230','b810350j','http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=35230')">fossil fuel</a></span> that can be burned, without control of emissions by sequestration. There is thus a like uncertainty in the amount of this globally shared energy resource that is imposed by the uncertainty in climate sensitivity.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">While the consequences of climate change involve many attributes of climate, not just global mean surface temperature, in considerations of strategies to limit climate change, these other consequences have generally been assumed to scale with, or expressed in terms of, increases in GMST, under the assumption that these further consequences become increasingly severe the greater the increase in GMST.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2,70,71</span></sup></a> Such considerations have impelled development of strategies to limit the increase of GMST to some specified, mutually agreed upon value. It is thus clear that any strategy to achieve such a goal strongly depends on Earth's climate sensitivity, as setting a target level of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (or CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> equivalent, a target that takes into account the forcings of GHGs other than CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, expressed as a mixing ratio of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) explicitly or implicitly requires an assumption of the value of Earth's climate sensitivity. The strong dependence of future temperature change on climate sensitivity was recently stressed by Hare and Meinshausen,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> who noted on the basis of probabilistic assessments of temperature change the strong influence of climate sensitivity on increase in GMST for a given emissions pathway, concluding that climate sensitivity is “of quite fundamental significance for policy in general and specifically in relation to the question of long term warming commitments.” The IPCC Working Group III similarly concludes in its 2007 report that “climate sensitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation scenarios that aim to meet specific temperature levels,” adding that “the timing and level of mitigation to reach a given temperature stabilization level is earlier and more stringent if climate sensitivity is high than if it is low” (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4">ref. 4</a>, p. 67).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The dependence of strategies for stabilizing Earth's temperature on climate sensitivity was explicitly examined by Edmonds and Smith,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> who applied an integrated assessment model that takes into account population growth, economic growth, energy requirements, energy availability, alternative energy sources, and approaches to limitation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions across various economic sectors globally to examine the means and costs of achieving various degrees of temperature stabilization for assumed values of climate sensitivity. The study posited a target maximum increase of GMST of 2 K above its preindustrial value and examined the approaches to and costs of stabilizing the increase of GMST to that level for three assumed values of climate sensitivity, Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> = 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 K, that are within the range of current estimates. Not surprisingly, it was found that the assumed sensitivity plays a major role in determining the trajectory of maximum future emissions that would be required to stabilize the increase in GMST to 2 K above preindustrial, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16</a>, which compares the several trajectories to that of a reference case based on assumed population increase and economic growth. For Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> = 1.5 K it was found that it was not necessary to begin substantial reductions in emissions until after 2050. Such an extended time period would allow for phase-out of existing <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: combustion" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001473','b810350j')">combustion</a></span> facilities and introduction of new controlled emissions facilities in an economically effective manner. In contrast for Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> = 2.5 K, stabilization of temperature required an early imposition of stringent reductions in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, with the peak in emissions as early as 2020 and with <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Molecular Process Ontology link for: reduction" href="javascript:popupOBO('MOP:0000569','b810350j')">reduction</a></span> by the end of the century to below half of current emissions. Edmonds and Smith also found that if Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> is 3.5 K or higher, it may be impossible to limit the increase in GMST to the 2 K target. These findings have economic implications as well. Whereas for climate sensitivity Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> = 1.5 K, the cost of stabilization was viewed as rather trivial, for Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> = 2.5 K, the discounted integrated cost of stabilization to 2 K increase in GMST was estimated as approximately 18 trillion US dollars (constant 1990 dollars); comparison of this figure to global annual GDP of $30 trillion in 2002 gives a sense of the magnitude of effort that would be required to achieve this level of climate stabilization and the importance of climate sensitivity to estimating that cost and in turn as input to decision making.</p>

An increase of 2 K in GMST, which is typical of values that have been suggested as characterizing the onset of dangerous climate change, represents an increase in GMST of less than one percent of its present value of 288K. The entire increase over the industrial period in downwelling longwave flux from the atmosphere to the surface from the long lived greenhouse gases that is at the root of the present concern over climate change, 2.6 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, is likewise less than one percent of that total flux, about 327 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. A first-principles calculation, with a computer model of the climate system, of the effect of such a 1% change in flux to an accuracy of, say, 10 or 20% thus imposes an accuracy requirement of order 0.1 or 0.2%, respectively, with a similar requirement on the accuracy of evaluation of the model. Such an overall accuracy requirement makes quantifying climate sensitivity a truly tough scientific problem.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As discussed above, accurate determination of climate sensitivity is limited by other major hindrances. Much of the model-to-model difference in climate sensitivity (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10</a>) arises from differences in treatment of clouds. Differences in treatment of clouds are also exhibited in the comparison of modeled albedo with observations (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7</a>). Accurately representing clouds in models, even high resolution models, is inherently difficult as the condensed-phase water represents a small fraction of the total water substance in a given volume of air, being the difference between the actual water content and the equilibrium water content at the local temperature. Temperature is subject to variation as a consequence of vertical motions (adiabatic compression or expansion), latent heat uptake or release, and <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: mixing" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001685','b810350j')">mixing</a></span>; these processes are strongly coupled, as well, as latent heat exchange affects the buoyancy of a given air parcel, inducing vertical motions and <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: mixing" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001685','b810350j')">mixing</a></span>. Condensed <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span> content is also controlled by <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span>, which is subtly dependent on cloud microphysical properties. Representation of clouds in current climate models is highly parameterized, in large part because of the large horizontal and vertical dimensions of grid cells in these models relative to the actual scales of the motions of the eddies that are responsible for cloud formation. It certainly seems that the accuracy of cloud parameterizations would benefit from much more detailed comparisons with observations. Recent work points to important new directions. One such direction is the so-called superparameterization approach of Randall <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> in which a GCM grid cell would be divided into much smaller cells, say one tenth of the dimension of the primary cell, in each horizontal dimension, and the model equations integrated for these smaller cells, not for the entirety of the initial grid cell, but for a stripe across the cell, which would allow for communication between the smaller cells. The computational requirements for such an approach would be several orders of magnitude greater than for present GCMs, but advances in computational power may make such an approach practical. Recent work describing clouds at much higher resolution (100 m or less in the horizontal and vertical) has yielded a very realistic representation of deep clouds and mesoscale organization of convection in computations that are free of many of the parameterizations that are required for GCMs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> While such scales are entirely impractical for global climate models, it may be possible to use studies on this scale to develop accurate parameterizations that can be employed in GCMs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A further major hindrance to reducing uncertainty in climate sensitivity arises from uncertainty in climate forcing over the industrial period. Although some uncertainty arises from uncertainty in radiative forcing by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and other GHGs, the overwhelming contribution to this uncertainty comes from uncertainty in the radiative forcing by aerosols. This uncertainty limits both empirical inference of climate sensitivity from observed temperature change over the instrumental record and evaluation of the performance of climate models over this period. The lack of constraint on forcing over the period of instrumental record has led to the present situation in which the observed change in global mean temperature can be accurately reproduced by models whose sensitivities differ by more than a factor of 2, with the more sensitive models employing a lower forcing and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>. The ability of current models to represent twentieth century climate would be more accurately assessed as the envelope of change in GMST obtained by exercising each of the models over the uncertainty range of forcing.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Although both observational and modeling approaches have been brought to bear to determine aerosol forcing, these approaches have not converged, and in fact recent work, by identifying hitherto unrecognized contributions to aerosol burden and forcing, such as by secondary organic aerosols, has actually led to a situation in which the uncertainty in aerosol forcing has appeared to increase. Improving the representation of aerosol forcing in climate models would require substantial effort: measuring emissions of primary particles and precursor gases and developing emissions inventories; characterizing the rates of atmospheric reactions that produce condensable gases responsible for aerosol growth and the dependence of these rates on concentrations of precursor gases and other controlling variables; developing accurate treatments of aerosol physical evolution through condensation of gases and coagulation; and representing the interactions of aerosols with <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:water" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.937.html">water</a></span> vapor governing aerosol light scattering, absorption, and cloud drop nucleation. There is a strong coupling of aerosol forcing with cloud processes, as aerosol particles modify clouds and precipitation formation, affecting cloud albedo and persistence, and as clouds are central to removal of aerosol particles through <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: precipitation" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001688','b810350j')">precipitation</a></span> and otherwise affect the composition and properties of aerosols through in cloud reactions; these couplings would need to be accurately represented in climate models. While substantially reducing uncertainty in aerosol forcing would require a great deal of effort,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48</span></sup></a> this effort could lead to important payoff in two directions. First, representation of aerosol forcing in climate models would be much more greatly constrained than at present, permitting much more rigorous evaluation of the performance of climate models over the industrial period. Perhaps just as important, a tightly constrained aerosol forcing would permit much more confident empirical inference of climate sensitivity directly from measured temperature change and known forcing over the period of instrumental temperature record.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25,76</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Determination of aerosol forcing is essential also to permit informed decision making about greenhouse gas policy that takes into account the extent to which the positive (warming) forcing due to increases in greenhouse gases has been offset by negative (cooling) forcing by anthropogenic aerosols. Knowledge of the extent of offset is very much at the heart of this decision making. Because of the short lifetime of tropospheric aerosols, about a week, compared to the long atmospheric residence times of excess CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and of other long-lived GHGs, whatever fraction of the forcing by the GHGs that is being offset by aerosols, it is a week's worth of aerosols—ast week's emissions—that is offsetting that fraction of decades worth of GHG emissions. As has been shown in model studies (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9">ref. 9</a>), an abrupt decrease in aerosol forcing, as might occur in conjunction with a major decrease in emissions of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> would have the effect of abruptly increasing total (positive) forcing exacerbating, perhaps greatly, the climate change that the decrease in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions was intended to forestall. Quantification of aerosol forcing is also essential to interpretation of climate change under conditions of rapidly increasing emissions, such as has occurred in the past several years in China. To the extent that increased emissions of <span class="TC"><a class="simple" title="Chemspider Compound link for:sulfur dioxide" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.1087.html">sulfur dioxide</a></span> (the precursor of sulfate aerosol) scale with the increase in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, then a new source, such as a new power plant, will initially exert a net cooling effect because the <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="ChEBI Ontology link for: sulfate" href="javascript:popupOBO('CHEBI:26820','b810350j','http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=26820')">sulfate</a></span> aerosol in a given pulse of emissions exerts its cooling influence immediately, whereas the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the same pulse of emissions exerts its warming influence over decades. In the long run the warming influence of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dominates, but at short times, perhaps a decade or more, the cooling influence of the <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="ChEBI Ontology link for: sulfate" href="javascript:popupOBO('CHEBI:26820','b810350j','http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=26820')">sulfate</a></span> aerosol dominates.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77,78</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The difficulties in determining climate sensitivity together with the renewed recognition<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> that errors in modeled feedback are amplified as the feedback strength approaches unity, have led to the suggestion by Allen and Frame,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> perhaps facetious, that the quest for determining climate sensitivity be called off. Allen and Frame go on to state that “once the world has warmed by 4 °C, conditions will be so different from anything we can observe today… that it is inherently hard to say when the warming will stop.” Rather than determine climate sensitivity, they suggest stabilizing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at 450 ppm and letting our descendants find out whether this was the appropriate target and make necessary corrections.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Several arguments may be raised in opposition to this suggestion. First, Allen and Frame confuse the sensitivity, expressed as Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small> with the actual equilibrium increase temperature that would result from a sustained doubled <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Chemical Methods Ontology link for: mixing" href="javascript:popupOBO('CMO:0001685','b810350j')">mixing</a></span> ratio of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Δ<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>2×</sub></small>, as defined, is not an actual temperature change; rather it is Earth's climate sensitivity, a local derivative of GMST with forcing, defined at some climate state of interest, expressed in units of temperature change. Further, although it is not unlikely that sensitivity would change with GMST because of changes in the climate state, such a dependence should not be a reason for abandoning the sensitivity concept; rather it should be an impetus to determine that dependence. More intrinsically Allen and Frame suggest a target CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>mixing ratio be selected based on current understanding, for example 450 ppm, and that our descendants revise the target—upwards or downwards as needed—once they observe how much the climate has changed. How did Allen and Frame come up with such a target mixing ratio? It is based on their perception of the climate sensitivity, the amount of increase in GMST that would be acceptable, and the ability of society to meet such a target. Developing a strategy to limit the increase in GMST to a target level, and even more so, developing an efficient strategy, requires knowledge of Earth's climate sensitivity.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">This paper has not examined means of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Broadly speaking there are four approaches to this: <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Molecular Process Ontology link for: reduction" href="javascript:popupOBO('MOP:0000569','b810350j')">reduction</a></span> in energy use (from decrease in services and from enhanced end-use efficiency); use of non-carbon sources of energy; carbon capture and storage; and <span class="CH"><a class="simple" title="Molecular Process Ontology link for: reduction" href="javascript:popupOBO('MOP:0000569','b810350j')">reduction</a></span> in the emissions of GHGs other than CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and of absorbing (soot) aerosols.

      <p class="otherpara">The present paper has focused largely on forcing by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, but forcings by other gases, and by aerosols, also need to be considered in developing strategies to limit the increase in GMST, especially as limiting emissions by these other forcing agents might lessen constraints on CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions and be more readily achievable.
