        <span class="bold">Lucy Carpenter</span> opened discussion of the paper by Christian George: Your previous work has emphasised the abiotic production of VOCs from surface ocean processes, mainly from photosensitized chemistry of surfactants. Does this work indicate that decay of microbial cells is the really dominant source of these VOC-producing surfactants and photosensitizers, and if so - does this really mean this is an abiotic process?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> responded: As shown in our paper, VOC emissions increased drastically when the microbial cells were dying. Moreover, the highest VOC production was observed for the cellular fraction of the biofilms, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> intracellular material and cellular debris. Thus, we think that cell lysis is at least one of the major sources for such VOC-producing surfactants in the ambient environment. Besides this, anthropogenic pollutants could be an additional source for surfactants, however, such emissions would be of rather local importance. Although the source for the surfactants is biogenic in our study, the observed photochemical production of VOCs can be defined as entirely ‘abiotic’.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Archibald</span> said: Thank you for the paper which emphasises some new, unexpected results and possibly highlights poorly explored biogeochemical cycles. I was wondering how to link this in to the changes occurring in the Anthropocene? Do you think that changes in temperature/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> will affect this? How about changes in nitrogen deposition/oxidants?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> responded: Although our results describe photochemical processes in the ambient environment that are not limited to the Anthropocene, such reactions at the air/water interface are certainly altered by anthropogenic emissions. For example, it was shown that nutrients from agriculture stimulate growth of microorganisms and algae in coastal waters.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Eventually such artificially enhanced blooms will lead to the emission of surfactants, which might then enhance VOC production from interfacial photochemistry. Nonetheless, further studies will be needed to assess the extent of anthropogenic influences on these mechanisms.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> remarked: You suggested that the photochemical reactions you discussed occur at the surface of the liquid. Two questions: first, can you please elaborate on how you concluded that your studies isolated reactions only at the surface? Second, could not photochemical process take place in the top layer (a few meters) of oceans and lakes, and thus influence atmospheric composition?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> replied: For the first question, we cannot entirely exclude any photochemistry occurring in the bulk. However, our previous work supports our conclusion, that surfactant-enriched air/water interfaces are preferred venues for the photochemical production of VOCs. Moreover, VOC emission always started immediately with irradiation of the sample, indicating that no diffusion processes in the bulk were slowing down the observed emissions. For the second question, indeed a variety of other photochemical processes can take place in surface seawater. A recent review by Carpenter <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> summarizes the most important production pathways for smaller VOCs in marine environments. However, these mechanisms do not yield unsaturated and functionalized VOCs, as observed in our study.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Williams</span> noted: There is a strong increase in the emissions when you kill the living organisms in your samples. You interpret this as the result of cell wall splitting and the associated release of intracellular organic species. Could an alternative explanation be that under normal conditions the living bacteria are rapidly consuming the emissions (created <span class="italic">via</span> the mechanism you propose) and that when this consumption stops when they are killed the emission rate shoots up to the total emission?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> answered: As described in the paper, we think that VOC production occurs primarily due to photochemistry at the air/water interface. Thus, a consumption of the produced VOCs by living organisms seems rather unlikely, since this would predominantly take place in the bulk.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Williams</span> asked: Following on from the previous question, do you know if the products you see are effectively taken up by living microbes as well?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> responded: As stated in my previous answer, we do not see any evidence for such a VOC consumption by microorganisms.</p>

        <span class="bold">Steven Brown</span> addressed Martin Brüggemann: Can you talk about your poster in terms of benchmarking on a global basis? Considering DMS as a benchmark, what fraction of DMS could you account for with a mechanism like this?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Martin Brüggemann</span> communicated in response: Current estimates on annual DMS emissions from the oceans into the atmosphere are in the range of 28.1 (17.6–34.4) Tg of sulfur, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> 54.5 (34.1–66.7) Tg of DMS.<small><sup>1</sup></small> In comparison, our calculations indicate an annual VOC emission flux of up to 74 Tg per year from interfacial photochemistry. However, in contrast to DMS emissions, this VOC flux is composed of dozens of compounds (see our paper for a complete list). Therefore, single VOCs make up only a rather small fraction of annual DMS emissions. For example, global isoprene emissions are estimated to be in the range of 0.5–0.9 Tg per year. Nonetheless, since this photochemical VOC production is not immediately coupled to biology, especially in remote oligotrophic regions, this may be a major source for VOCs.</p>

        <span class="bold">Meredith Hastings</span> asked: What do you suggest is a way to distinguish biogenic <span class="italic">versus</span> non-biogenic emissions of the type you are suggesting are important? Does this require continuous observations? At what time scale?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> answered: Currently there is no established approach to distinguish between VOC emissions from biology and from photochemistry at the air/water interface. Moreover, field observations are typically scarce and only available for short time periods, impeding a clear source apportionment. Nonetheless, recently a promising study was published by Mungall <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>1</sup></small> reporting on direct observations of OVOC production from interfacial photochemistry.</p>

        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> remarked: The reference data for pure water shown in Fig. 2 of your paper (blue line) seem to be lacking the level of noise detected for the other three experiments, even for the part of the experiment before the lights are on. Can you explain why this would be the case?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> replied: The reason for the apparent low level of noise is solely due to the scaling of the axes.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> queried: On a very speculative level, I would like to ask whether the mechanism introduced by you and the mechanisms leading to isoprene exhalation by humans have something in common.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> replied: Up to now, we don’t see any link between these mechanisms.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Reid</span> said: The measurements of surface tension that you present suggest that the surface enrichment of organic components is quite low with a surface tension that is only marginally below water. As a comparison, such a surface tension can be observed in aqueous dicarboxylic acids solutions, water soluble organic compounds identified by you in the extract, at concentrations of ∼0.1 M. To what extent do you think there is competition between photochemistry at the surface and in the bulk? Is all of the chemistry you describe happening exclusively at the surface?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> answered: It should be noted that not all of the compounds enriched at the air/water interface are necessarily strong surfactants which efficiently decrease surface tension. We note that in addition to straight chain surfactant molecules, exopolymeric substances, hydrated gel materials, organic particulates and fragments of marine microbes also concentrate there.<small><sup>1–3</sup></small> Furthermore, it was shown that already very low concentrations of a surfactant at the air/water interface can give VOC emissions in the ppb range upon irradiation.<small><sup>4</sup></small> As stated in one of my previous answers, we cannot entirely exclude influences from photochemistry in the bulk, however, to the best of our knowledge there are no alternative mechanisms explaining the observed formation of unsaturated OVOCs upon irradiation.</p>

        <span class="bold">Iustinian Bejan</span> asked: Did you measure any light dependency? Switching to a different number of lamps could see if the emissions are linear with the light and may improve the knowledge about this process. Additionally, a good test would be to replace the air used to drive out the emissions with nitrogen. If there are pure light dependent processes the bath gas should not affect the emissions. If there is oxygen dependency - could it be a revived cell issue?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> answered: Up to now, we did not conduct any experiments of this kind for biofilm samples. However, Rossignol <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> and Tinel <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> showed in similar experiments that molecular oxygen addition occurs at a surfactant-coated air/water interface due to photosensitized reactions, eventually yielding unsaturated and functionalized VOCs. Thus, a light dependency can be assumed for these interfacial processes.</p>

        <span class="bold">Iustinian Bejan</span> then asked: Did you change the surface of the biofilm system? It would be interesting to check the emission dependency on surface for the same layer thickness (with an actually constant quantity of dead cells) and the layer thickness dependency (dependency per gram) while keeping the surface constant.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> replied: We did not conduct any experiments of this kind yet. However, they might indeed help to gain additional knowledge on the underlying mechanisms.</p>

        <span class="bold">Alexander Archibald</span> opened a general discussion of the paper by Tomás Sherwen: Really nice talk Tomás. My question is about the large ozone loss in the Mediterranean. Losing 30 ppb sounds like a huge amount to me. There is some evidence that models overestimate ozone in this region<small><sup>1</sup></small> and I wondered if you felt that the modelled halogen ozone loss would bring your model results closer to the observations available in this region or further away? And if the latter, would this be a bad thing?</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tomás Sherwen</span> replied: We present comparisons against ozone observations from the UK air-quality network and for these sites we do not see a systematic overestimate in our model. Due to the availability of observations at the time of writing the manuscript, a comparison with European (AirBase/EMEP) observations was not presented. Our more recent work comparing the model to the AirBase/EMEP observations suggests that the modelled ozone is improved in the Mediterranean region with addition of halogens. We will publish this in the future.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Steven Brown</span> addressed Tomás Sherwen and Mathew Evans: O<small><sub>3</sub></small> is often correct in air quality models. Your model required halogens to reproduce O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, but other models do not. Are all previous models wrong that didn’t include halogen chemistry? Or are other models likely correct for the wrong reasons?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The difference between Br, I, and Cl is that chlorine gives a positive change in O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, but Br and I produce large negative changes. But Br and I come mainly from natural sources, while Cl is from ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and is anthropogenic. Should these all be considered together?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mathew Evans</span> replied: All halogens have both anthropogenic and natural sources. Much of the iodine in the atmosphere comes from the ocean inorganic source which is driven by surface ozone, much of which is anthropogenic in origin. There are routes to get sea-salt chlorine into the gas phase which don’t involve N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small>. In our model (almost undoubtedly not right but where else are we to start?) most of the chlorine (87%) comes from non-ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sources. In the polluted boundary-layer, ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dominates but for most of the atmosphere it does not. So we need to be careful when we allocate halogens into being either natural or anthropogenic. Their chemical cycles are also closely coupled which makes separating them clearly difficult. In our recent paper<small><sup>1</sup></small> we have tried to look at the difference in halogens between the “pre-industrial” and the present day. Almost universally the concentrations of halogen have increased since the pre-industrial era. We are only just starting to understand the role of halogens in the tropospheric chemistry system. We need new observations (notably HOI, HBr, HOBr, ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, HCl, HOCl) together with our current techniques to make wide-spread observations in a range of chemical environments to be able to test our models.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tomás Sherwen</span> added: There are many reasons for a difference in ozone between models. This can be differences in sinks and sources. There is evidence for ozone loss through halogens<small><sup>1</sup></small> so this chemical process should be considered by our models. If ozone is currently captured by models that don’t consider halogen chemistry, this could be explained by an overestimate in sinks or an underestimate in sources.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Reactive chlorine has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Our model predicts that Cl<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> production from N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> is a significant source at the surface, but a smaller player globally in our model (15%).<small><sup>2</sup></small> The net result of this chemistry is not necessarily an increase in O<small><sub>3</sub></small> as this will depend critically on the NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> concentration. We find that the net effect on ozone over the whole region (whether global or regional) is a decrease due to chlorine chemistry. This is due to a decrease in the NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> concentrations through halogen nitrate hydrolysis. The effect of halogens on the NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> budget is discussed in further detail in Schmidt <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>3</sup></small> As we say in the paper: “It seems likely therefore that when all chlorine sources are considered together they lead to a reduction in O<small><sub>3</sub></small> mixing ratios...”.</p>

        <span class="bold">Mathew Evans</span> remarked: Just because a model simulates roughly the correct ozone, it doesn’t mean it is ‘correct’. Two wrongs have been known to make a right in the modelling world. Historically models which just transported stratospheric ozone into the troposphere and deposited ozone to the surface seemed to simulate the tropospheric ozone concentration ‘correctly’. There are many other areas of our understanding of tropospheric ozone which would lead to compensating increases – ocean deposition, VOC oxidation <span class="italic">etc.</span> These models are ‘subconsciously’ tuned to observations all the time. I’m sure that there will be a way of increasing model ozone concentration if it was found that the inclusion of halogens led to a significant underestimate.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan Williams</span> said: Given that nitryl chloride is a key compound in the halogen and ozone chemistry you are investigating, does it make sense to determine halogen impacts on ozone when the modelled and measured ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> do not match?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tomás Sherwen</span> replied: The only source of ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the model is from N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> uptake onto sea-salt aerosol. This appears to underestimate the sources in continental regions. Whether this is due to acid displacement of HCl from sea-salt, followed by uptake into sulphate aerosol, or from direct continental sources of HCl which then become chloride, is currently scientifically unclear. The paper acknowledges that the model appears to underestimate ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, especially in continental regions, and this likely leads to us underestimating the impact of ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> chemistry on European ozone. This is not the only failure of the model when it comes to chlorine chemistry. Globally we calculate ∼62% of the global Cl<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> source being from organo-halogens.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Given that the model used here does not include a range of short lived chlorine containing organic species,<small><sup>2</sup></small> it likely underestimates the total Cl source significantly. We are working on improving this chemistry in subsequent versions of the model. The wider impact of the other halogens (BrO, IO) are also significant in the model both due to local chemistry and global impacts with significant uncertainties from gas phase kinetics, emissions rates, heterogenous processing <span class="italic">etc.</span> Philosophically though, the question seems to suggest that model development and evaluation should only occur when the models are capable of perfectly simulating observations or when a complete process level understanding is available. This appears to create a chicken and egg situation. The models cannot be evaluated until they are perfect, but the models need to be evaluated if they are to improve. Imperfect models need to be used to help guide future field and laboratory studies and future model development. We believe we have been honest about the performance of our model against observations and identifying its failings. We do not believe that suppressing modelling until they are able to “match” observations is going to help drive our understanding of atmospheric processes forwards in a useful way. Modelling and measurement need to go hand in hand, informing one-another and supporting the different scientific methodologies. However, much of the impact that we see in the model comes from the global response of ozone to halogens and the regional impact. This is much more driven by iodine and bromine chemistry.</p>

        <span class="bold">Dwayne Heard</span> commented: In the paper several datasets of radical species from field campaigns are mentioned, in the context of comparison with the output from the GEOS-CHEM model. It is recognised that the paper is only looking to give a rough comparison with measurements, but it is worth pointing out that the footprint of the measurement technique can make quite a difference. For example, for IO radicals, datasets at Mace Head and Brittany are discussed with a range of values of the mixing ratio of IO given. It should be stressed that the range of values quoted comprises both long-path DOAS measurements of IO and <span class="italic">in situ</span> measurements of IO using laser-induced fluorescence. It is known that for the same site these values can differ significantly owing to the heterogeneity of the distribution of iodine sources. For example, at Mace Head, DOAS and LIF values vary by up to a factor of 10, as the LIF instrument is very close to the exposed macroalgae (so gives higher mixing ratios) whereas the long path of the DOAS over several km is mostly over the ocean surface rather than exposed macroalgae so the average mixing ratio along the long-path is much less, with the ratio depending on the depth of the tide and the wind direction.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tomás Sherwen</span> replied: As you point out there are a range of issues when comparing the concentration of short lived species both with other observations and with models. The current observational datasets for species such as IO have focussed on coastal locations with substantial spatial gradients which leads to these differences between local and spatially integrated techniques. Future observations in open ocean locations where these gradients are less defined would probably offer a more critical and useful assessment of model performance.</p>

        <span class="bold">Dwayne Heard</span> asked: The paper reports an average reduction in surface OH mixing ratio of 16%. I wondered what the equivalent change was for HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> radicals? One could imagine this would be larger, owing to the direct reaction of HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with IO and BrO. Can the change in OH and HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> when halogens are included be compared with existing field datasets of OH and HO<small><sub>2</sub></small>? There are some in the Mediterranean, for example during the MINOS campaign in Crete. In favourable cases, it may be possible to see if there is a better agreement between model and measurements if halogens are included, which would provide further evidence for the impact of halogens. The situation is somewhat different for box model comparisons when halogens are included, as O<small><sub>3</sub></small> is then usually fixed by measurements, whereas if O<small><sub>3</sub></small> is not constrained then O<small><sub>3</sub></small> would be expected to decrease and hence impact HO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Tomás Sherwen</span> answered: We have not compared against OH and HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> observations here. We have reported global changes in HO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> in more detail elsewhere.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small> The change in HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is more complex.

We are currently assessing how the inclusion of halogens changes the model’s ability to simulate present day and past O<small><sub>3</sub></small>. We show a limited comparison against UK AQ monitoring sites in this paper (Fig. 3, 4, and SI3), a limited but global comparison for the present day in Sherwen <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>5</sup></small> and comparisons with pre-industrial values in Sherwen <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>6</sup></small> Globally the model improves in some locations and regresses in others. The overall performance is not completely clear but we feel that the inclusion of halogens probably removes the model’s high bias and replaces it with a low bias. This would suggest a need for either an additional source of O<small><sub>3</sub></small> (changes in NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> or VOC chemistry?) or a reduction in the O<small><sub>3</sub></small> sink (ozone dry deposition?).<small><sup>8</sup></small> The impact of these changes on ozone radiative forcing is unclear. We think that halogens in themselves tend to reduce O<small><sub>3</sub></small>.<small><sup>6</sup></small> However, if observations suggest that an additional source of O<small><sub>3</sub></small> is needed, this would tend to increase the O<small><sub>3</sub></small> radiative forcing. Overall we believe that our understanding of the chemistry acting to determine the O<small><sub>3</sub></small> concentration in the troposphere is more uncertain than that reflected in the current spread of models used to determine O<small><sub>3</sub></small> radiative forcings by the IPCC. We also note that the spread in those models probably underestimates the uncertainty in the chemistry that they do include.<small><sup>7</sup></small> There is still work to be done to understand the chemistry needed to represent the change in O<small><sub>3</sub></small> between the pre-industrial and the present day. Thus we believe that there is significant uncertainty in what is the important chemistry occurring in the troposphere which is not reflected in the IPCC O<small><sub>3</sub></small> radiative forcing calculations. We also note that there is significant uncertainty in the rate kinetics used. If this chemistry was considered in a model that did not contain the same level of ozone production (natural or anthropogenic) as in our model then an underestimation in ozone mixing ratios would be expected. Obviously an overestimation in the ozone sink from deposition, as suggested by Luhar <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>8</sup></small> could also explain capturing ozone observations when a loss route through halogens is not considered.</p>

For the day when Cl atoms were modelled to be at a maximum (the day after the maximum mixing ratios of ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> were observed during the night), Cl atoms dominated the oxidation of alkanes in the early morning. The % removed by Cl atoms averaged over the whole of this day were: Alkanes (15%), Alkenes (3%) and Alkynes (26%). These can be compared with the average removal by Cl atoms for the whole ClearFlo campaign which was Alkanes (3.7%), Alkenes (0.66%) and Alkynes (7.4%). The average alkane % value is smaller than the value in your present paper given for ethane (12%) and propane (9.1%), but this might be expected as Cl atoms may be expected to play a smaller role than other oxidants in urban centres compared to the average for the European boundary layer.</p>

        <span class="bold">Tomás Sherwen</span> replied: Thank you for your comment with more comparisons of reported removal of VOCs by Cl in London. The values we present are averaged throughout the boundary layer and therefore represent a regional scale that includes rural and urban airmasses, rather than solely urban, so cannot readily be compared to those at a single site in London. There are some forces occurring here. The relationship between Cl oxidation and NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> are not completely clear. As NO concentrations increase it seems likely that N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> and so ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentrations are likely limited by the rate of production of NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and thus O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Just as for OH, it seems likely that the response of ClNO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and thus Cl in urban environments is likely a nonlinear function of NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> emissions. When considering the relative oxidation of urban VOCs by Cl and OH as a function of NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> emissions/concentration it is not at all obvious how that responds and a box model may be appropriate to explore the relative contributions processes further.</p>

        <span class="bold">Catherine Scott</span> replied: Thanks for your comment and question. This is a very good point, and not something we really explore (the complexities of the VOC oxidation chemistry) in this study. The largest (zonal annual mean) changes we see in ozone concentration are in the tropical upper troposphere due to the efficient convective transport of air masses containing O<small><sub>3</sub></small> precursors (in this case the products of VOC oxidation, particularly isoprene). This is consistent with other work we have done (currently under review) to explore the impact of complete deforestation on BVOC emissions, and therefore ozone concentrations. For complete, idealised, tropical deforestation we simulate a reduction in zonal annual mean ozone concentration of up to 20 ppb in the tropics at around 200 hPa. This region (tropical upper troposphere) is also the most important region radiatively in terms of changes to O<small><sub>3</sub></small> concentration (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Rap <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small>), so processes that lead to the changes in O<small><sub>3</sub></small> here are particularly important to get right when diagnosing climate impacts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In terms of surface O<small><sub>3</sub></small> changes, these are sensitive not only to the magnitude of the change in BVOC emission, but whether the region is NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> or VOC limited. As highlighted by Squire <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>2</sup></small> the same change in isoprene emission (for example, due to LUC) can lead to different responses in surface O<small><sub>3</sub></small> for the same location when different chemical mechanisms are applied. In particular the study highlighted that the sign of the change of O<small><sub>3</sub></small> can be reversed in models that do not include PAN production as a result of isoprene chemistry. Improving our knowledge of isoprene oxidation chemistry in the atmosphere (for example, in terms of product yields) will be vital in order to accurately diagnose the impacts of BVOC emission changes on ozone, but also for improving our representation of secondary organic aerosol formation.</p>

        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> then asked: Would you be confident in discussing your biogenic aerosol–cloud radiative forcing result with policy-makers?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Catherine Scott</span> replied: Thank you for the question. When discussing any of the radiative forcings associated with changes to SLCFs (due in this case to historical land use change) with policy makers, I would be keen to stress that currently global chemistry-climate models/Earth System Models do not agree on the sign/strength of all of these changes and that we are still learning more about the role of biogenic VOCs in both the gas and particle phase. The biogenic aerosol–cloud RF is a good example, I think we can be confident that the oxidation of both monoterpenes and isoprene (and other VOCs) produces a variety of products with a range of volatilities and that some of these compounds play key roles in the formation and growth of particles in the atmosphere. In the model we use here (the GLOMAP aerosol microphysics model), by enabling the growth of particles up to the size at which they are able to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the presence of biogenic SOA exerts an overall negative radiative effect through the aerosol indirect effect. Other models simulate the distribution of the oxidised organic material across the size distribution differently – we examined the impact of a “kinetic” <span class="italic">vs</span> “mass-based” approach to distributing organic material<small><sup>1</sup></small> and found that this is an important control on the strength of the aerosol indirect effect due to biogenic SOA. Additionally, changes to CCN concentration also depend on the baseline aerosol size distribution that is being perturbed. In some situations, the addition of extra SOA will grow existing CCN-sized particles to a larger size (regardless of the method used to distribute the SOA across the size dist) and the result is that fewer particles will activate. So understanding the role of biogenic SOA also requires an accurate representation of everything else that influences the aerosol size distribution.</p>

        <span class="bold">Paul Young</span> remarked: The impact of BVOCs on SLCFs will be dependent on the chemical environment they are emitted into. Your model simulations used anthropogenic emissions for the year 2000, and this will likely play a large role in the size of impact that you determine for the changing BVOCs. How different would the impact be when using, say, pre-industrial anthropogenic emissions? Furthermore, do you have any thoughts on the “right” way to calculate/report impacts for these kinds of experiments?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Catherine Scott</span> answered: Thank you for your question – yes the anthropogenic emissions that we assumed (in this case for the year 2000) will have an impact on the magnitude of the radiative effects we diagnose for the changes in SLCFs. We have shown previously that the strength of the aerosol indirect effect associated with natural aerosol<small><sup>1</sup></small> and biogenic SOA in particular<small><sup>2</sup></small> is sensitive to the anthropogenic emissions assumed in a simulation (with a stronger negative AIE simulated in the absence of anthropogenic emissions). The direct radiative effect due to natural aerosol/biogenic SOA is less sensitive to the anthropogenic emissions used as this tends to scale more linearly with the mass of aerosol being added to the atmosphere, in the GLOMAP aerosol microphysics model.<small><sup>2,3</sup></small> These analyses assumed a much cleaner pre-industrial atmosphere (as compared to the present day), but there is still substantial uncertainty around the level and spatial extent of fires in the pre-industrial period.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In the gas-phase, NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> concentrations will determine whether changes to VOC emission lead to an increase or decrease in ozone concentration. Heald and Geddes<small><sup>4</sup></small> found that the reduction in ozone due to historical LUC was around 35% greater when they assumed year 2000 anthropogenic emissions, as compared to a simulation in which anthropogenic emissions for the year 1850 were used. Assuming that we were to find the same response for ozone, this suggests that if we had used pre-industrial anthropogenic emissions – we would have simulated a larger (positive) aerosol indirect effect, similar direct radiative effect and a smaller (negative) ozone radiative effect.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Catherine Scott</span> responded: Thanks for your question. Yes the tropospheric ozone burden we simulate here (approximately 290 Tg O<small><sub>3</sub></small>) is lower than the range reported across the ACCMIP models – we are currently reviewing the reasons for this. As you point out, a level of ozone that is too low will affect the amount of oxidation occuring and the formation of secondary organic oxidation products.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">We assume a fixed molar yield of 13% for the production of a secondary organic gas-phase condensable species from the oxidation of monoterpenes, and a molar yield of 3% for the production of a secondary organic gas-phase condensable species from the oxidation of isoprene. In our year 2000 simulation that assumes present-day land cover, we simulate an emission of 453 Tg isoprene yr<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 161 Tg monoterpene yr<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and produce approximately 15 Tg SOA yr<small><sup>−1</sup></small> from isoprene and 22 Tg SOA yr<small><sup>−1</sup></small> from monoterpene oxidation. These values are consistent with molar yields of 3% and 13% for isoprene and monoterpene oxidation, respectively, at the appropriate molecular weights – so we can be reasonably confident that we are not limiting the ability of SOA precursors to oxidise (at the global annual mean level). Our simulated reduction in global annual total BVOC emissions (of 13%) due to land cover change between the years 1850 and 2000 carries through to a 13% reduction in global annual SOA production. However we will continue to investigate the causes and impacts of the low ozone burden in this particular model version.</p>

Moreover, to the best of our knowledge cholesterol is more common to animal life than to plants or microorganisms.

Thus, we cannot exclude the presence of small amounts of cholesterol in the samples.

        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> opened a general discussion of the papers by Christian George, Tomás Sherwen and Catherine Scott: Thank you for your three interesting papers. In looking at each of your papers, a couple of questions come up. First, what is the key thing one can think about going backwards or going forwards based on the work you presented? Currently we are already in the Anthropocene and I assume that the goal of humanity is to leave this epoch into a more a sustainable age. Therefore, what do you see is important in your area to enable us to get away from major human influences?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> responded: First, as explained in an answer to an earlier question from Alexander Archibald, our results describe photochemical processes in the ambient environment that are not limited to the Anthropocene. However, these interfacial reactions are certainly altered or even enhanced by anthropogenic activities. For example, nutrients from agriculture stimulate growth of microorganisms and algae in coastal waters which eventually increases surfactant concentrations at the air/water interface. Nonetheless, up to now our results indicate that VOC emissions from interfacial photochemistry are especially important in remote regions of the oceans. In these locations anthropogenic influences are believed to be rather small yet. However, changes in surfactant concentrations due to human activities would, thus, have the largest impact on interfacial photochemical VOC production and, hence, also on atmospheric chemistry especially in such remote regions. The second question is difficult as further studies will be needed to quantify the extent of anthropogenic influences on photochemical VOC production at the air/water interface. Therefore, it is difficult to give an answer at this point on how to reduce human influences on these photochemical processes, but in general, humans will have to further reduce their fingerprint on this planet by reducing emissions.</p>

        <span class="bold">Tomás Sherwen</span> answered: One point here is that there is a tendency to think about environmental problems as discrete separate problems. The stratospheric ozone hole and tropospheric ozone production are separate problems which need separate modelling tools to understand them. In reality many of these problems are linked. For example from our work we have shown that the co-release of halogenated compounds (whether they decompose in the troposphere or in the stratosphere) with photo-pollutants (VOC, CO, NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small><span class="italic">etc.</span>) ultimately leads to a reduction in the total production of ozone pollution by those photo-pollutants.<small><sup>1–3</sup></small> Moving to a more Earth system science perspective on atmospheric chemistry will allow us to understand in a more holistic sense what the impacts of humanity are on the atmosphere.</p>

        <span class="bold">Catherine Scott</span> responded: We show in our paper (and others have before) that historical land use change has not just had an impact on terrestrial carbon storage and the reflectivity of the surface, but also the composition of the atmosphere. We find that for LUC between 1850 and 2000, the gas-phase and aerosol radiative impacts (examined in our paper) almost cancel out. The way that land-use changes over the next century will depend strongly on society’s response to the threat of climate change. For example, the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) each assume a very different land cover transition over time, in terms of forest and crop area and how the two link to food production and energy generation. To enable humanity to develop sustainably we will need to further understand the complex impacts that LUC has on the atmosphere, and ensure that we are not acting in a way that exacerbates future warming.</p>

        <span class="bold">Lucy Carpenter</span> addressed Christian George: I think an important question is how to disaggregate any surface ocean emissions, providing evidence for these mechanisms, from the more well known and characterised emissions from sub surface (mainly biological) production. One way to do that is to compare eddy co-variance measurements from ships with bottom up fluxes inferred from bulk seawater. That has been done for some of the OVOCs (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, acetone) proposed as products of this surface chemistry (M. Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2014, ref. 1), which I believe shows that if anything there could be a loss of acetone at the surface. Is there other evidence for surface sources, or do you believe that the uncertainties involved leave room for them?</p>

        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> responded: We agree that up to now field observations of VOC emissions from interfacial photochemistry are scarce. One major challenge here is certainly to distinguish biological and photochemical VOC production. Nonetheless, a promising approach was recently published by Mungall <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> In this study, factor analysis was applied to shipboard measurements of an HR-ToF-CIMS and an ‘ocean factor’ was isolated, comprising several signals for OVOCs.

        <span class="bold">Stephen Arnold</span> said: I wanted to ask about your assumption about fires being anthropogenic. The “aerosol-free” world may not be an analogue for pre-industrial if some fires are natural. Does this have implications for your conclusions if not all fires can be attributed to anthropogenic activity?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> answered: Our goal is that the “anthropogenic pollution aerosol-free” world represents the global climatic state that we would be living in now without the historical rise in anthropogenic aerosol pollution (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a warmer, wetter world). We are not interested in pre-industrial (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, colder, drier) analogues. You raise an important question about biomass burning aerosol emissions. Firstly, what were the pre-industrial fire emissions and what is pre-industrial? These questions are very difficult (almost impossible) to answer with available measurement/observational data. In this study, we assigned all biomass burning emissions to be anthropogenic because, in the present day climatic state, it becomes increasingly challenging to define exactly what is human-influenced fire activity and what is not. Deforestation and land-clearing fire aerosol emissions (which are the dominant fraction at the global-scale), are unambiguously anthropogenic. Wildfire aerosol is less clear cut, for instance, if wildfire emissions have been human-modified in some way, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> by anthropogenic climate change, human land use land cover change, and/or human fire suppression/ignition, then which category do they fall into exactly? We apply a global gridded inventory that separates 2 fire sources: “forest fire” ∼ deforestation and land clearing; “grassfire” ∼ wildland fire. I have some concerns that the aerosol impact results over central west Africa are the least “anthropogenic” of all our findings. Because the largest aerosol climate impacts found in the Amazon and North American boreal zones are strongly dominated by the global-scale cooling (mediated through ocean feedbacks), driven by the NH mid-latitude pollution band, I argue that our major conclusions are relatively insensitive to the biomass burning aerosol categorization. That said, it would be interesting in future experiments to include only “forest fire” aerosol emissions as anthropogenic, and compare with results here. We could even potentially begin to think about an historical loss of wildfire (and aerosol emissions) occurring in the temperate zone due to human land use and land cover change that precedes the NH mid-latitudes aerosol pollution band from the fossil-fuel/energy revolution. A further distinction is that fire regimes tend to be sporadic in nature, and have much larger spatiotemporal variability that aerosol emissions from fossil fuel, energy and agricultural activities.</p>

In this period the atmosphere was not aerosol free, but contained natural aerosol.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> replied: The study does not have any “pre-industrial case”. The contemporary decadal average world in 1996–2005 is contrasted with the global climatic state that would exist in this decade in the absence of the historical rise in anthropogenic aerosol pollution (a warmer, wetter world). In the manuscript, “aerosol-free” means “anthropogenic pollution aerosol-free”.

        <span class="bold">Drew Shindell</span> said: Over the past few decades we have done some things with power plants, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> scrubbers, that primarily affect aerosols (and ozone) but not the long-lived greenhouse gases. If we move to clean power sources and other practical ways we might change emissions in the future, would the simultaneous greenhouse gas changes cancel out the aerosol-related effects you discuss?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> responded: To some extent, yes. The “AEROSOL-OCEAN” feedback components in the regional response signals effectively give us quantitative information about aerosol forcing increases and/or GHG forcing decreases in the Earth system. However, examination of the “AEROSOL-LAND” case tells us that the aerosol climate change effects on land ecosystems are not exactly simply equivalent to the reverse of the carbon–climate feedbacks shown in IPCC AR5 Fig. 6.22. The aerosol forcing is concentrated over land regions and activates different land–atmosphere feedbacks than would an equivalent magnitude GHG forcing. Most simply put, aerosols are predominantly interacting with the downward SW, whereas GHGs are interacting with the LW. For instance, there is no GHG-equivalent to aerosol diffuse radiative fertilization. Concentrated aerosol forcing over land decreases SW radiation at the land surface that decreases surface evaporation and increases soil water availability in some areas but simultaneously decreases precipitation in other areas. In general, aerosol pollution impacts on regional precipitation patterns are not yet completely well understood, and are rather model dependent, but it is agreed that they will not be the simple reverse of the GHG spatial patterns (because modifying SW <span class="italic">versus</span> LW has different impacts on regional hydrology). In contrast, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fertilizes the land biosphere leading to enhancements in NPP, “the carbon-concentration feedback”; and there is no equivalent/analogous aerosol impact. Aerosol deposition to the land surface can have biogeochemical effects on ecosystem health (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, adding nutrients or acidic toxins), but these effects are not assessed in this study that focuses on climate change. In summary, without performing fully coupled future simulations, it is not clear how future combined changes in aerosols, ozone and GHGs will influence the land biosphere and the land carbon sink. For instance, reducing GHGs and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> would, over decadal to century timescales, show a similar spatial pattern to “AEROSOL-OCEAN”, but at the same time reduce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fertilization benefits. As we head into the future, the aerosol forcing becomes increasingly much less important relative to the GHG and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> forcings. In other words, the protection of Amazon ecosystem health over the past 2–3 decades from inadvertent climate engineering with NH aerosol pollution has been an unintended transient benefit. Our analyses focus on annual average changes, which likely emphasizes temperature over precipitation. Future investigation of seasonal and monthly changes may reveal more important roles for aerosol-induced regional precipitation changes.</p>

        <span class="bold">Andreas Wahner</span> opened discussion of the paper by Alla Zelenyuk: Does this trapping of PAHs in the SOA not shorten the atmospheric residence times of PAHs? Isn’t there an enhanced removal process of PAHs from the atmosphere? PAHs are not water soluble but SOAs are, therefore by trapping the <span class="italic">e.g.</span> wash-out and deposition could be enhanced?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alla Zelenyuk</span> responded: We have recently developed a new modeling paradigm for long-range transport of particle-bound PAHs, in which PAHs are protected from evaporation and oxidation by highly viscous SOA.<small><sup>1</sup></small> This new modeling approach was incorporated in a global climate model, which takes into account dry and wet aerosol deposition, with the latter taking into account aerosol size and hygroscopicity. We demonstrated that our new “SOA shielded” paradigm increases oxidation lifetime of benzo[<span class="italic">a</span>]pyrene (BaP), used as a PAH model system, from 2 h to 5 days. Most importantly, compared to previous models it predicts considerably higher BaP concentrations near urban sources and in remote locations, significantly improving agreement between model predictions and hundreds of field observations.</p>

        <span class="bold">Steven Brown</span> said: The result seems remarkable that such a small amount of PAH has such a large effect on SOA formation from a much larger concentration of VOC. At what level would this effect turn off? Even at 7 ppt you might be talking about a level that is higher than real situations, but if it were present at even lower concentrations it would be quite important. What about black carbon? Does it possibly have the same effect as a PAH?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alla Zelenyuk</span> replied: The vapor pressure of ∼7 ppt for benzo[<span class="italic">a</span>]pyrene (BaP) represents the lowest PAH concentration investigated in the experiments thus far. The data clearly show that even at 7 ppt, it has a significant effect on SOA formation and properties. It is important to note that in many locations, especially close to the sources of biomass burning and power plants, the overall concentration of gas-phase PAHs often exceeds this level (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> and Galarneau <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>). We agree, that given the low concentrations of reacted and unreacted PAHs acquired by SOA particles, their impact is surprisingly large. One possible explanation, suggested by Shiraiwa <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>3</sup></small> is that long-lived ROIs can play important roles in heterogeneous ozonolysis of PAHs and affect SOA formation and properties. In their mechanism, the weakly bound physisorbed ozone molecule undergoes dissociation to form molecular oxygen and ROI, such as chemisorbed O atoms bound to the delocalized π-electrons of PAH aromatic surfaces. These long-lived ROIs may then form oxygenated PAHs or react with other chemical species, including those formed during oxidation of SOA precursors. The surface interactions of long-lived ROIs could also lead to the formation of multifunctional organic compounds, including oligomers, with high molecular weight and low vapor pressure, which are required for the nucleation and growth of new particles. We do not expect that black carbon particles will have the same effect as the PAHs presented here. We anticipate that the aromatic surfaces of black carbon will rapidly become coated by the condensing SOA and will no longer interact with ozone molecules. In contrast, in the experiments presented in this paper there is a steady source of gas-phase PAH molecules, which continue to adsorb on the surfaces of SOA particles throughout their formation and growth.</p>

        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> questioned: What type of condensed phase chemistry may take place after trapping the PAH? Can you quantify physical trapping <span class="italic">versus</span> chemical uptake?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alla Zelenyuk</span> answered: Our more recent observations indicate that SOA particles with trapped PAHs indeed can undergo further chemical transformations, including heterogeneous reactions with ozone and subsequent condensed-phase oligomerization leading to an increase in particle viscosity and the fraction of nearly non-volatile constituents, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> oligomers. The quantification of trapped unreacted and reacted PAHs in SOA particles during formation and growth is a focus of our ongoing studies that utilize real-time mass-spectrometric analysis as well as offline measurements of particles collected on filters.

        <span class="bold">Barbara Finlayson-Pitts</span> asked: First, you mention that pyrene oxidation products are trapped, in addition to pyrene itself. Do you have any idea of the relative contributions of pyrene and its oxidation products? Second, when you look at single particles, do you ever see separate individual particles primarily from either PAH or SOA, or are they always mixtures?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alla Zelenyuk</span> replied: The quantification of trapped unreacted and reacted PAHs acquired by SOA particles during formation and growth is part of ongoing research in our laboratory. Preliminary data indicate that concentrations of unreacted and reacted PAHs in the SOA particles depend on many parameters, including the specific PAH and its concentration, SOA formation and growth rate, ozone concertation, and more. However, just as an example, the preliminary results of filter analysis indicate that SOA particles formed by ozonolysis of 200 ppb of α-pinene formed in the presence of pyrene are composed of ∼1% pyrene, of which ∼20–30% has been oxidized. To answer the second question, single particle analysis indicates that all the particles are mixed, containing both SOA and PAHs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Grazia Rovelli</span> said: One of the main claims of the paper is that when SOA is formed in the presence of PAHs the degree of oligomerisation is increased which leads to an increase in viscosity and a decrease in the vapour pressure of the organic components formed. I have two questions related to this aspect. First, you always observe a decrease in volatilisation kinetics for SOA formed in the presence of PAHs, and this is attributed to increased viscosity and decreased average vapour pressure of the organics in the SOA. Do you have a feeling of which one of the two (either increased viscosity or decreased vapour pressure) is more important?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Secondly, on page 13 of your paper you measure a diffusion coefficient for pyrene within SOA and then you report a value of viscosity, which I assume is calculated with the Stokes–Einstein relation. Could you please confirm that this is how the viscosity value you present is calculated? In addition, this value of 2 × 10<small><sup>7</sup></small> Pa s for viscosity of α-pinene SOA formed in the presence of PAHs does not seem to be significantly higher than what has been meassured for ‘regular’ α-pinene SOA (see for example Maclean <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small>). In addition, Stokes–Einstein has been shown to be inaccurate for water and for larger molecules than pyrene at low relative humidity (see Chenyakin <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>). Since pyrene has a molecular weight that is somewhat in the middle between water and the paper that I reference here, don’t you think that it is very likely that this viscosity value is incorrect, considering both the fact that it seems to contradict all the other results you have in your paper and possible inaccuracies of Stokes–Einstein?</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alla Zelenyuk</span> Our data, including those presented in this paper, clearly show that the presence of PAHs during SOA formation and growth increases SOA oligomer content. For example, Fig. 5b shows that the mass spectra of α-pinene SOA particles formed in the presence of pyrene (αP-PY-SOA) exhibits increased relative intensity of peaks at high <span class="italic">m/z</span>, suggesting they contain more oligomers that have higher molecular weight and lower volatility, which agrees with the particle evaporation data shown in Fig. 2a.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">To investigate the relative contributions of high particle viscosity and low volatility on SOA evaporation kinetics (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the asymptotic value of the volume fraction remaining (VFR) after ∼24 hours of evaporation) we compare the particle evaporation kinetics at low and high RH. We find, for example, that for pure α-pinene SOA (αP-SOA) an increase in RH from &lt;5% to ∼90% results in decrease in the asymptotic value of VFR from 25% to 20%. For αP-PY-SOA particles the same change in RH results in the asymptotic value of VFR decreasing from 70% to 55%.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In response to your second question, it is important to point out that most other studies determine SOA viscosity, which is then used to infer chemical diffusivity (the key property relevant to SOA phase), using the Stokes–Einstein equation (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Shrivastava <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> and references therein). As you point out, the diffusivity of small molecules, such as water, was reported to be orders of magnitude faster than that predicted by the Stokes–Einstein equation. Note that in our study, we directly measure diffusion and evaporation rates of pyrene in SOA particles from which we estimate viscosity. As we previously reported, the diffusivity of pyrene in αP-PY-SOA particles is 2.5 × 10<small><sup>−21</sup></small> m<small><sup>2</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which yields an estimate of particle viscosity of 10<small><sup>8</sup></small> Pa s (Abramson <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>). The viscosity of 2 × 10<small><sup>7</sup></small> Pa s, you refer to in your question, is actually estimated for aged cyclooctene SOA particles formed in the presence of pyrene, which has lower viscosity than αP-PY-SOA.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Measurements on aged αP-PY-SOA particles yield an estimated diffusivity ∼3 times smaller, indicating that hardening occurs with time, which is consistent with the increase in SOA oligomer content, and decrease in evaporation rate observed with aging. There are no contradictions!</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As far as comparison between our reported viscosities and other literature values, we refer to the measurements presented by Grayson <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>3</sup></small> and used in the modeling paper cited by you above. For the range of SOA concentration we use, Grayson <span class="italic">et al.</span> (Fig. 3) report viscosity values in the range of ∼5 × 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> Pa s–2 × 10<small><sup>7</sup></small> Pa s. As they specifically state in their paper, our viscosity estimate is outside of their reported viscosity range, as it should be, given that our particles were made in the presence of pyrene.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Finally, we feel that it is also very important to look at “big picture” rather than focus on what we see as relatively small differences. All the reported values indicate that at low RH these particles are semi-solid and have viscosity million time higher than previously assumed.</p>

        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> commented: Thank you very much for this interesting data you have presented. I would like to hear more about the relevance of anthropogenically generated SOA for the formation of cold clouds. Usually, anthropogenically generated SOA are emitted near the ground. During lifting to higher altitudes they most likely go through the liquid phase before they freeze. Could you please elaborate on the atmospheric relevance of your results?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Daniel Knopf</span> replied: When anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles are lifted to higher altitudes, they experience increasing relative humidity (RH), supersaturation with respect to ice, and decreasing temperatures. During this process the particles can acquire water in the subsaturated regime until they reach water saturation. Our study optically detects if biogenic SOA or anthropogenic SOA coatings on soot, deliquesce completely or incompletely when going through the liquid phase. This can lead either to homogeneous or heterogeneous ice nucleation, respectively, the latter due to the presence of an insoluble or solid organic or soot particle. As described in the article, this will also depend on the updraft velocity. In the case of vertical air motion in clouds, the fast updrafts may result in high RH before full deliquescence occurs, especially important for highly viscous organic aerosol (OA). Our study emphasizes the interrelationship between ice nucleation and SOA phase state changes due to RH and temperature changes, which was also investigated by Berkemeier <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>1</sup></small> Lienhard <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>2</sup></small> and Price <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>3</sup></small> Naphthalene SOA coated soot particles studied here formed ice at water saturation temperatures warmer than homogeneous freezing. One explanation for this is that the soot particles acted as ice nuclei (IN) after complete deliquescence of the thin SOA coating. However, a study by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>4</sup></small> has shown that naphthalene SOA particles initiated ice formation at the same conditions, alternatively implying that there was remaining solid SOA present on the soot surface that initiated freezing within the surrounding liquid. SOA derived from higher molecular weight organic precursor gases may have higher <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>g</sub></small><small><sup>5</sup></small> and FDRH, and could result in a stronger propensity to act as IN despite the presence of a liquid phase.

        <span class="bold">Daniel Knopf</span> responded: In this study, we use the diffusivity estimation scheme developed in Berkemeier <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> With this semi-empirical scheme, the water diffusion coefficients in aqueous sucrose can be extrapolated to different, chemically similar substances. The parameters determining the diffusion coefficients are the glass transition temperature of the pure substance (in this case α-pinene or naphthalene secondary organic aerosol, SOA) and the hygroscopicity of the material, <span class="italic">e.g. κ</span><small><sub>org</sub></small>. The underlying assumptions of this methodology are: first, differences in diffusive properties are to a substantial degree due to factors such as molar mass and shape, both of which directly affect the glass transition temperature.<small><sup>2</sup></small> Second, the way by which the glass transition is approached is not affected strongly by the SOA type, as all organic compounds relevant for SOA are fragile glass formers.<small><sup>3</sup></small> Third, the plasticization effect of water is the same irrespective of SOA type. In Fig. S8 of Shiraiwa <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>4</sup></small> it has been shown that the estimation of water diffusion coefficients in α-pinene SOA compares well to experimentally determined values by Lienhard <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>5</sup></small> Note that these measurements were published after the development of our estimation method and no fitting was performed here.</p>

        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> opened a general discussion of the papers by Nadine Unger, Alla Zelenyuk and Daniel Knopf: You all talked about a few interesting phenomena, each from a different perspective. The implication in your talks is that it is important to include these processes in models. How do you actually include this type of data in models? Are we giving enough thought to how specifically such information could be used and included in models?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> responded: Which “models” exactly? The answer depends on what you need to simulate and over which spatiotemporal scale. For instance, are you interested in simulating aerosol particulate concentrations in an urban airshed, or understanding chemical and dynamical processes that control aerosol distribution using aircraft campaign data, or the regional climate response to global aerosol loading in the future world in 2100 <span class="italic">etc.</span>? It is important to distinguish between CTMs and CCMs. CCMs and global Earth system models simulate their own meteorology and climatic state from scratch (and increasingly also other components, including dynamic vegetation and full carbon and methane cycles), which, by definition, leaves less computational resources available for the chemistry and aerosol processing, as compared to a CTM that simply reads in offline reanalysis meteorology. Therefore, CTMs can afford quite explicit and detailed process-based chemistry and aerosol representations today, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> as in GEOS-Chem. That said, state-of-the-science CCMs do include fairly detailed process-based chemistry and aerosol modules today too <span class="italic">e.g.</span> CAM5-Chem, HadGEM3-ES and many others. In response to Daniel Knopf’s excellent presentation, some CCMs today are indeed at the stage of including advanced aerosol interactions with mixed-phase and ice clouds, for example we include black carbon acting as ice nuclei in some of our recent work. As a large-scale chemistry-climate modeller, the question to Alla Zelenyuk would be, do the effects of gas-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons influence the regional and global radiative effects of BSOA, at scales of ∼100s of km? If the answer is yes, then we have strong motivation to move forward and implement the interactions into the global climate model. If the answer is no, but they do strongly affect the distribution of BSOA and localized weather impacts in and around megacities – then the interactions could be included in those spatiotemporal scale models.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Daniel Knopf</span> answered: When considering implementation of our type of data into models two aspects have to be addressed. First, representation of the phase state of organic aerosol (OA) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles under typical atmospheric conditions. Second, parameterization of ice nucleation rates for representative OA and SOA particles. Both aspects depend on the scale of the model, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> a climate model, cloud resolving, and/or atmospheric chemistry model. Shiraiwa <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> very recently developed a parameterization scheme implemented in the global chemistry climate model EMAC<small><sup>2</sup></small> that includes the organic aerosol module ORACLE<small><sup>3</sup></small> to predict the phase state of SOA particles. Since the time steps of climate models are usually large, detailed microphysical parameterizations, as derived from our experiments, cannot be directly implemented except when employing great simplifications (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> by giving a fraction of the ice nucleating particles). The community applies cloud resolving models, compared against field observations, to validate ice nucleation parameterizations. Currently different ice nucleation descriptions for the various ice nucleation pathways are discussed in the literature. To facilitate implementation of immersion freezing in larger scale models, we have developed a water activity based immersion freezing model,<small><sup>4,5</sup></small> similar to the water activity based homogeneous ice nucleation theory.<small><sup>6</sup></small> This model is based on classical nucleation theory and requires temperature, relative humidity, and surface area of the ice nucleating particles to derive an ice nucleation rate. These parameters are available in models that treat aerosol particles and cloud formation.</p>

        <span class="bold">Gabriel Isaacman-VanWertz</span> addressed Daniel Knopf and Alla Zelenyuk: We heard a lot about aromatics and PAHs, but these are not that representative of anthropogenic OA. Could you talk about how your results might (or might not) be specific to aromatics and what you might see if you used compounds more representative of anthropogenic OA such as branch alkanes or other saturated hydrocarbons? In particular for Alla Zelenyuk, is the observed PAH impact on particle formation and properties unique to PAHs, or would it also be observed with other gases that are present at their saturation concentration? Such an experiment would help elucidate the mechanism for the effect, and help determine if it is a chemical process, or if it is a more physical process that is sort of a “side-effect” of equilibrium partitioning.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Daniel Knopf</span> responded: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) stem from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and wood<small><sup>1</sup></small> and as such represent an ubiquitous, chemically identifiable SOA precursor gas of the Anthropocene. Indeed, this does not necessarily mean that these chemical species dominate the organic fraction in organic aerosol (OA), but can act as a surrogate for OA which experiences a glass transition under conditions important for atmospheric ice nucleation. The glass transition temperature (<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>g</sub></small>) has been shown to depend on molecular weight, O<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>C ratio, and water content.<small><sup>2–4</sup></small> In terms of how glassy particles impact ice nucleation, we are not aware of ice nucleation experiments using alkane or saturated hydrocarbons derived SOA. As discussed in Koop <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>3</sup></small> the presence of aliphatic species with high molar mass could yield potentially similar <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>g</sub></small> to the case of naphthalene. However, this may depend on the degree of oligomerization and polymerization.<small><sup>3</sup></small> Berkemeier <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> have derived <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>g</sub></small> and full deliquescence relative humidity (FDRH) for SOA particles generated from dodecane reacting with OH (see Fig. S4 in Berkemeier <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>). Dodecane SOA showed the lowest <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>g</sub></small> and FDRH compared to α-pinene, isoprene, and naphthalene derived SOA, in agreement with particle bounce experiments by Saukko <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>5</sup></small> This also suggests that those SOA particles have negligible impact on mixed-phase cloud formation similar to investigated biogenic SOA particles. Ice nucleation experiments on field-collected particles from polluted environments dominated by OA and SOA indicate the potential of these OA and SOA particles to form ice, in absence of other more efficient ice nucleating particles.<small><sup>6–8</sup></small> Overall, this question warrants further laboratory investigation to firmly assess the role of anthropogenic derived SOA particles in cloud glaciation processes.</p>

        <span class="bold">Alla Zelenyuk</span> answered: We agree that future studies should investigate the effect of other types of hydrophobic organics on the formation and properties of SOA particles. Thus far, in addition to PAHs, we characterized α-pinene SOA particles formed in the presence of gas-phase dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and dioctyl sebacate (DOS), two plasticizers, whose concentrations in the experiments were 200 ppt and 20 ppt. The data indicate that both DOP and DOS molecules were incorporated and trapped in the SOA particles and their presence increased the nearly non-volatile particle content, as evidenced by measured evaporation kinetics.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Data presented in the present paper indicate chemical interactions between oxidation products of SOA precursor and PAH. We showed that the presence of PAH during SOA formation and growth results in the formation of new products, which include oligomers. Physical processes, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> mixing, cannot explain the observed large changes in SOA particle properties, given that the PAHs make up only a few percent of the particles formed in the presence of PAHs. In addition, as we have previously shown, equilibrium partitioning cannot explain the formation of α-pinene SOA particles in the presence of pyrene. We have also demonstrated that the properties of particles formed in the presence of PAHs are drastically different from those of pure SOA particles with pyrene deposited on their surfaces after SOA formation.<small><sup>2</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">Alexander Archibald</span> remarked: Just a follow up to Ravi’s comment about bridging the gap between the lab and model communities. As the community is moving toward more structured approaches to code/software management, do you think that that’s going to enable better linking of lab work and models?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> answered: I am not aware of any direct evidence to suggest that more structured approaches to code and software management enable better linking of lab work and models. CCMs and Earth system modelers welcome with open arms the improved code management strategies. I suggest that JULES and GEOS-Chem provide powerful examples of how model communities can operate most effectively with free flow of information, regular community meetings, proper accreditation, respect, and appointed “gatekeepers”/managers of the codes. Multi-faceted excellent research groups that include laboratory physical and environmental chemistry integrated with modelling across different spatiotemporal scales potentially provide a seamless way for better linking of lab studies and models. However, many IPCC-class global chemistry–climate model research institutes (government labs and universities) are not directly associated with an in-house physical chemistry laboratory, and when they are, that doesn’t necessarily imply any free flow of information.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jos Lelieveld</span> said: I would like to suggest a partially alternative approach, coming back to a point from earlier. Models are often going too strongly toward the operational side as there is not much CPU power to spend on chemistry. Actually, I think we should use models as tools to study processes and so they should include as much detail as possible – and then scale things back for operational applications.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> replied: Again, which “models”, impacts, and over what spatiotemporal scales exactly? I fully agree that CTMs must be used as tools to study processes including as much detail as possible. That is one of the main reasons for the existence of CTMs. CCMs and Earth system models should then utilize the information gained from CTMs about the important necessary processes for simulating radiation and climate.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Wahner</span> said: If, as you stated, an “easy” parameterization for SOA formation dependent on biogenic precursors works better in climate runs for CMIP compared to a now available detailed chemical mechanism, what chance do you estimate for process oriented understanding of atmospheric chemistry to be used in global models ? How do we achieve a process based understanding and modelling of the atmosphere?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nadine Unger</span> answered: I refer back to my response to Ravi’s earlier question. What is the simulation goal/objective of the global model exactly? Are you using a global CTM to understand SOA formation and processes in different regions with aircraft measurement datasets, or are you using a global CCM to calculate the radiative effects of SOA in the present and future worlds? Process-orientated understanding of atmospheric chemistry and SOA formation is already available in many global CTMs, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> GEOS-Chem. Several research groups have found that a fixed yield approach to simulate SOA matches available measurements and observations <span class="italic">e.g.</span> from the AMS, better than “more sophisticated” VBS-type approaches. We have limited information available at the moment to constrain the response sensitivity of SOA in models to changes in meteorology and background pollution emissions over large spatiotemporal scales, for example. In our paper presented here, the NASA climate model included a VBS-type approach to BSOA simulation. Using this approach, the model predicts that the climatic effects of anthropogenic aerosols actually enhance BSOA levels in the atmosphere; thus, increased availability of organic particles for condensation outweighs the reductions in precursor BVOC emissions. In contrast, if the model were to incorporate a fixed yield BSOA approach, the opposite sign impact would occur in response to anthropogenic aerosols, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> anthropogenic aerosols would suppress BSOA levels. Indeed, many state-of-the-science global climate models in the CMIP6 assessment will not represent any interactive SOA or nitrate aerosol – they may prescribe offline fields from other global simulations. For global chemistry–climate and Earth system models, the key question is: what level of process-based representation of SOA formation do we need to simulate accurately the radiative effects and response to global change?</p>
