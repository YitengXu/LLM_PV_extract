part of a series of annual reviews which cover the various aspects of analytical atomic spectrometry and follows the same format as last year's.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> Although an attempt is made to consider all relevant refereed papers, conference abstracts, reports, book chapters and patents for inclusion in this review, the content of the review is highly selective. The selection of papers is based on criteria applied to focus sharply on the most significant developments in instrumentation and methodology or improved understanding of the fundamental phenomena involved in the MS process. The increasing importance of speciation and the blurring of boundaries between atomic and molecular MS require a high degree of judgement to be made in considering papers for inclusion. The main ruling criterion for all speciation papers is that the work should involve or be intended for the study of natural systems. For example, the study of synthetic metal clusters is generally not included, whereas the determination of organometallic compounds in environmental samples is.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Applications of atomic MS are not covered in this Update and readers are referred to the Updates on Industrial Analysis: Metals, Chemicals and Advanced Materials,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> Environmental analysis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> and Clinical and Biological Materials, Food and Beverages.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a></span></p><p><span class="italic">Throughout this review, the term molecular ion will be restricted to denote only the positive or negative radical ion formed by removal or capture, respectively, of an electron.

Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)</span></h2><h3 id="sect538"><span class="b_heading">1.1. Reviews</span></h3><span>The <span class="italic">overview of AMS</span> by Hellborg <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> gave a concise, yet clear, introduction to the design principles of an AMS system, with particular reference to the instrumentation at the Lund facility. The characteristics of AMS that made it possible to measure very low isotope ratios (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, <small><sup>14</sup></small>C∶<small><sup>12</sup></small>C down to 10<small><sup>−15</sup></small>) were highlighted and emphasis was placed on the importance of the ion source. A list of all AMS facilities worldwide was presented with details of the type of accelerator. Several topical applications were discussed, including the use of <small><sup>14</sup></small>C in dating, environmental and biomedical studies and the measurement of <small><sup>27</sup></small>Al and <small><sup>59</sup></small>Ni.</span><p class="otherpara">Although the use of <span class="italic">gas-filled magnets</span> for isobaric separation requires relatively powerful accelerators, it allows measurement time to be reduced as a result of the increased beam intensities. The review by Leino<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> on gas-filled separators had a relatively brief section on AMS but included a useful discussion on the characteristics of the separators and their main design principles.</p><p class="otherpara">The publication of several <span class="italic">application reviews</span> highlighted the wide range of research topics that AMS supports. The review of Muzikar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> on AMS in geological research can be recommended for its overview of AMS techniques and their strengths and limitations. Production and transport of cosmogenic nuclides (<small><sup>26</sup></small>Al, <small><sup>10</sup></small>Be, <small><sup>14</sup></small>C, <small><sup>36</sup></small>Cl <small><sup>129</sup></small>I) in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere were discussed and specific applications in areas such as geomorphology, tectonics, climatology, hydrology and geochronology were used to demonstrate the wide range of geological studies for which AMS was being used. In addition to presenting a good overview of the AMS technique, Lappin and Garner<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> highlighted the role of AMS in the increasing use of human trials for drug development. The role of AMS in forensic science was described by Tuniz <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> in particular as an ultra-sensitive tool for crime laboratories.</p><h3 id="sect567"><span class="b_heading">1.2. Instrumentation</span></h3><span>Regular upgrades are applied to AMS instruments to improve performance and increase the range of elements that can be determined. As a result, each instrument becomes unique in its design and capability, which are usually described in the form of a “facility report”. The <span class="italic">Vienna Environmental Research Accelerator</span> has been upgraded to a universal facility to allow long-lived radionuclides from the lightest (<small><sup>10</sup></small>Be) to the heaviest (<small><sup>244</sup></small>Pu) to be measured at natural abundance.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10,11</span></sup></a> Detailed descriptions and excellent schematic layouts were given for all components of the system (ion source, low-energy injection system, tandem accelerator, high-energy analyser and heavy-ion beam line). All components were designed to avoid beam losses, to achieve ultimate sensitivity, and to maximize stability. Additional, moveable slits were installed after the injection magnet in order to increase mass resolution to about 900 while maintaining high transmission. Good insulation was required as the slits were mounted inside the multi-Faraday-cup chamber, which was at 13 kV. A high-resolution electrostatic analyser (ESA) replaced the Wien filter of the original configuration. Charge changing and scattering of ions inside the ESA were reduced through maintenance of good vacuum (&lt;10<small><sup>−7</sup></small> mbar). As the detector to be used depended on the ion to be measured, a switching magnet at the end of the ESA exit beam line deflected the ion beam to the appropriate detector. Only a TOF detector had sufficient resolution to distinguish between neighbouring isotopes of heavy ions. The diamond-like carbon foils used as the start and stop detectors were the thinnest carbon foils available and were mounted on a flat copper mesh (1.2 µm wire thickness) of 90% transmission.</span><p class="otherpara">A well-designed optical system is required in an AMS instrument to transport the beam from the ion source aperture to the accelerator with a minimum of loss. Older designs of the low energy system have been seriously limited by the use of a single-focusing magnet with a bending angle of only 15°. A new injector installed at the <span class="italic">Lund AMS facility</span> included a 90° double-focusing magnet and a 90° spherical ESA for optimum mass and energy separation, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> The calculations used for the design of the optics were discussed in detail. Other improvements reported for the Lund system included the installation of terminal pumping in the accelerator.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> In comparison with the unmodified instrument, this allowed a higher gas density in the stripper and improved vacuum in the accelerator tubes to be used, and resulted in increased beam transmission and better measurements. Pressure profiles were calculated from vacuum conditions obtained for different stripper gases and gas pressures in the modified system and were compared with those obtained for the unmodified system. The pressure profiles were to be used to calculate the transmission and charge-state distribution for the stripping of different heavy ions.</p><p class="otherpara">Improvements at the University of Arizona facility, where a new 3 MV system was installed in 2000, have centred mainly on <span class="italic">sample preparation for radiocarbon dating</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> Details were given of the new instrument and its advantages for the measurement of <small><sup>26</sup></small>Al, <small><sup>10</sup></small>Be and <small><sup>129</sup></small>I. The processing of samples followed several well-defined steps and targets were pressed into a holder designed in-house. A stepped-combustion procedure was developed for the analysis of bulk sediments with low C concentrations.</p><p class="otherpara">The report from the <span class="italic">Seoul National University facility</span> highlighted some of the problems experienced in running their system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> Sparking in the accelerators was attributed to excessive moisture present during the monsoon season. Precautions were required to prevent memory effects which could occur when both biomedical samples with high <small><sup>14</sup></small>C concentrations and other samples with lower concentrations were analysed on the system. In order to prevent the detector from becoming flooded with excessive count rates, the stripping efficiency was reduced to a low level by not recirculating the stripper gas (Ar). Use of an elemental analyser to combust samples was preferred as it gave lower background levels than combustion using CuO, even though the resulting targets gave a much lower ion beam current.</p><p class="otherpara">An <span class="italic">AMS facility dedicated to the depth profiling of <small><sup>3</sup></small>H</span> in graphite samples from the wall material of fusion experiments was installed at Rossendorf (Germany) in order to prevent contamination of the existing facility.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> The dedicated facility was based on an air-insulated low-energy (100 keV) accelerator equipped with gas stripper. After gaining experience with this system, a second, compact, system was constructed with a SF<small><sub>6</sub></small>-insulated 100 kV tandem accelerator and diamond-like carbon stripper foils. The LOD was 5×10<small><sup>10</sup></small> atoms cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> and the depth range &gt;50 µm. Although results obtained on the different AMS systems were consistent, a difference of a few orders of magnitude was observed between samples with low concentrations analysed by AMS or a conventional procedure involving combustion followed by liquid scintillation counting. The compact system could also be used for the simultaneous depth profiling of Be, C, <small><sup>2</sup></small>H and Li using a Faraday cup at the entrance of the accelerator (SIMS mode).</p><p class="otherpara">Methods for on-line AMS analysis continue to receive attention. A <span class="italic">laser-induced sample combustion interface</span> has been designed for the continuous production and analysis of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> In this way, a sample such as the effluent stream from a chromatographic or electrophoretic separation could be analysed without the fractionation normally required. A direct-injection pyrolytic interface, used to produce H<small><sub>2</sub></small> for the determination of <small><sup>3</sup></small>H, was designed for nl min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> flow rates and operated without desolvation.</p><p class="otherpara">Most of the methods developed to overcome the problem of atomic isobaric interference are variants of the “range and rate of energy loss” methods used to identify heavy ions. Litherland <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> modelled the use of resonant and near-resonant keV ion reactions for <span class="italic">isobar separation</span> of <small><sup>135</sup></small>Ba<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>135</sup></small>Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small>. Although the method could theoretically be exploited for isobar suppression, multiple scattering could be a problem and needed to be taken into account.</p><p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">microchannel plate detection system</span> with double delay line anodes and using custom-designed readout electronics has been developed for AMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> The 12 modules, each with a 10×2 cm active area, together covered 80% of the 1.5 m focal plane in the split-pole spectrograph. The MeV ion beam passed through a thin carbon foil, placed at 40° with respect to the beam, to produce electrons that were detected by the array. A horizontal resolution of 0.4 mm was obtained for secondary electrons accelerated to 2.5 keV. To improve this resolution, a Helmholtz-type coil pair was built to confine further the secondary electrons within a magnetic field. The new detector system was seen to hold the advantages of high-resolution position measurements, subsequent energy analysis, simultaneous readings at different positions, tolerance of high-intensity beams, handling a wide mass range and low background when used with other detectors.</p><h3 id="sect616"><span class="b_heading">1.3. Developments in radiocarbon analysis</span></h3><span>Improvements in sample preparation have dominated advances in AMS radiocarbon analysis. In their overview of radiocarbon <span class="italic">dating of iron-based artefacts</span>, Cook <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> focused mainly on the simplification of sample preparation and reduction in the sample size requirement. The use of rust as a viable source of material for dating would allow precious samples to be analysed with little damage to the artefact but only on the condition that original carbon remained within the rust matrix. The authors demonstrated that carbon could be extracted from rust cleanly and gave plausible dates for the artefact, but issues of contamination and post-deposition carbon exchange still needed to be investigated. A summary was presented of all 63 previously published results for iron-based materials, together with 29 results previously unpublished. Not all iron-based materials were suitable for radiocarbon analysis, especially when materials were reworked, and Craddock <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> questioned in considerable depth the interpretation of AMS dates obtained from C in iron. A notable feature of the paper was the detailed discussion of the various manufacturing processes used to produce iron and steel through history and the consequences these would have on the accuracy of dating. The authors concluded that any iron samples could have been subjected to several processes involving heat, reduction, oxidation and carburization with a variety of fuels and fluxes, each containing C in a number of forms. This would make dating unreliable. For most artefacts the technology used to produce the iron is unknown and there was a high likelihood that the final process removed all evidence of earlier processes. The authors were not entirely pessimistic, however, and considered radiocarbon dating, when used together with other archaeological information, to be useful for elucidating the possible history of the artefact, even if a reliable date was not available.</span><p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">plasma-chemical procedure for the extraction of <small><sup>14</sup></small>C</span> from perishable archaeological artefacts was found to have four main advantages over traditional combustion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> It was “virtually non-destructive”, acid pre-treatment to remove carbonate was unnecessary, the background was low and the presence of oxalates in the sample did not affect extraction. Samples were initially subjected to multiple Ar plasmas to remove loosely adsorbed CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and then to multiple O<small><sub>2</sub></small> plasmas to produce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the sample. The process selectively oxidized organic C in samples (for example, cloth, wood, bone) and was almost non-destructive in that it only removed organic matter (about 0.1 mg C) and left carbonate, oxalate and other mineral phases unattacked. No visible changes in paint samples were discernable. Mass fractionation was low (equivalent to ±32 years) and could be corrected by measuring the δ<small><sup>13</sup></small>C in the same aliquot of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> used for the <small><sup>14</sup></small>C determination. Dates obtained by the procedure agreed well with those obtained previously by combustion.</p><p class="otherpara">A major drawback in the <span class="italic">direct dating of archaeological ceramics</span> is that organic carbon in buried artefacts can be contaminated by migrating soil organic matter of a different age. An important advance in such analyses targeted pure organic compounds derived from organic residues of commodities processed in the vessels during their use.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> Automated preparative capillary GC with wide-bore capillary columns was used to isolate n-hexadecanoic and n-octadecanoic acids from lipid extracts from archaeological potsherds in high purity (&gt;95%) and an amount (&gt;200 µg) sufficient for AMS analysis. The major advantage of the compound-specific technique was that <small><sup>14</sup></small>C dates could be obtained for the individual compounds, which could be associated directly to the commodities (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, animal fats) processed in the vessels. Analyses of appropriate blanks and controls established that introduction of background <small><sup>14</sup></small>C contamination was minimal. Initial results yielded good correlations between the predicted date of pottery and that measured using <span class="italic">n</span>-octadecanoic acid. The use of n-hexanoic acid could provide anomalously young dates, probably as a result of contamination by soil organic matter.</p><p class="otherpara">Kristiansen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> hypothesized that the age of a prehistoric burial mound could be determined by dating <span class="italic">components of soil organic matter</span> from a buried soil surface. The soil organic C was probably formed by photosynthesis at, or shortly before, the time of burial. Soil samples were taken carefully using augurs, thereby minimizing disturbance to the mounds, and the soil organic matter extracted using acid–alkali–acid fractionation. The best age estimates were obtained by dating humic acid fractions from the organic-rich layer in the upper cm of buried soil. Considerable discrepancies from the reference dates were found for the age estimates of some samples. This probably resulted from the migration and recycling of soil organic matter and led to an uncertainty of at least 280 years. The approach could only be recommended if no more than minimal disturbance of the earthworks were allowed and no macroscopic organic remains were available.</p><p class="otherpara">The potential problem of contamination in the direct dating of <span class="italic">pigments in prehistoric cave paintings</span> was addressed by applying a sample treatment procedure designed to extract only the organic C from the pigment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> A succession of “acid–base–acid” treatments removed carbonates from the limestone walls or ground water, humic acids from the degradation of organic matter and bacteria and other living micro-organisms.

Isotope ratio measurement</span></h3><span>A <span class="italic">new approach to the estimation and correction of mass bias</span> was based on modelling the instrument response function.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> Isotope ratio measurements of Cd and Sn were used to study the variation of mass bias with time, absolute mass and mass difference between isotopes in multiple collector (MC) ICP-MS. No statistically significant variations were seen over the first 20 min of analysis, after which the data deviated significantly from the original measurement. The pattern of the points about the mean value suggested spectral interference and/or inaccurate values for the true isotope ratios as the cause of the deviation. However, the variation of bias with mass difference between isotopes did show a linear relationship. When a true instrument-response function was investigated using a multi-element solution, a second order polynomial provided the best fit to the data. The mass bias correction derived from such a model was used to calculate corrected Cd isotope ratios that were closer to the natural values than those obtained from other, commonly used, correction expressions. Increasing the concentration of a matrix element (bismuth or calcium) significantly affected the value of Cd and Mg isotope ratios. The direction and magnitude of the effect was dependent on the position in the MC array with the heavier isotopes suffering higher levels of suppression. This effect was instrument dependent and was not observed for an instrument with a different MC array. A method of semi-quantitative analysis was developed that used the bias of 16 isotope ratios across the <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> range to define the parameters in a quadratic instrument-response function. The function was then applied to calculate the concentration of 24 analyte elements based on knowledge of ionization efficiencies and the concentration of a single internal standard. This approach gave errors in the calculated concentrations that were comparable with the results obtained by using 6 internal standards, and did not require separate measurement of a standard solution to predetermine the instrument response.</span><p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">transient and steady state signals</span> for the determination of isotope ratios was discussed by Carrion <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> The transient signals were generated using a FI system with four different loop volumes coupled to an ICP-TOFMS <span class="italic">via</span> a Meinhard or an ultrasonic nebulizer.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)</span></h2><span>The bombardment of a sample with primary ions in the 1–25 keV range causes the development of a collision cascade over a distance of several tens of nm below the surface. Along its trajectory the projectile imparts sufficient energy to the lattice to break all intermolecular forces and to move individual atoms from their initial positions in the lattice. The generation of the analytically used secondary ions is believed to occur through the recoil of momentum towards the surface. While the extensive atom relocation destroys the molecular structures in the subsurface, a substantial fraction of the analytes in the upper (few) monolayer(s) remain intact because of the ultra-fast penetration. In static SIMS (S-SIMS) experiments, sputtering is limited to only a fraction of the upper monolayer to maximize the contribution of ions that are representative of the molecular form of the element. Speciation and characterization of organic surface analytes forms the major application of this technique. Depth profiling experiments are excluded by the principle of S-SIMS. This review restricts the use of the acronym SIMS to the dynamic mode that uses continuous sputtering for the erosion of subsequent layers. As a result, the elemental composition in the subsurface can be monitored as a function of depth. To clearly distinguish between the essentially different analytical features of the two methods, SIMS is treated in sections 6.2–6.5 and S-SIMS in a separate section 6.6. Both types of instrumentation are covered in section 6.1. As TOF mass analysers provide advantages for dynamic as well as static experiments, explicit distinction will be made between TOF SIMS and TOF S-SIMS. The incidence and emission angles, mentioned throughout this section, are expressed as the angle between the beam and the normal to the sample surface.

Although the reaction had a high (&gt;90%) extraction and derivatization efficiency, the mass spectra were highly irreproducible due to decomposition reactions. These reactions were dependent not only on temperature but also the state of the mass spectrometer. The use of the most inert materials was therefore recommended. Use of a suitable internal standard (for example, selenoethionine for selenomethionine) compensated for the variations in conditions and the overall method repeatability was good at 1–2% RSD. Of three reagents tested, methyl chloroformate was the preferred derivatization reagent.</p><p class="otherpara">A proposed scheme for the conversion of <span class="italic">iodide</span> into 4-iodo-<span class="italic">N,N</span>-dimethylaniline by reaction with 4-<span class="italic">N,N</span>-dimethylaniline was rapid (&lt;1 min) and insensitive to the many ionic compounds present in salts, pharmaceuticals or foodstuffs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit295"><sup><span class="sup_ref">295</span></sup></a> The derivative was suitable for extraction by SPME using PDMS- or polyacrylate-coated fibres or by single drop microextraction (SDME).

New methodologies</span></h3><span>There is considerable interest in cosmic dust, the fine-grained matter that pervades the solar system and beyond. A novel <span class="italic">cosmic dust mass spectrometer</span> called the Dustbuster has been designed to determine the elemental composition of cosmic dust particles by impact ionization and TOFMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> The performance of the Dustbuster was tested with µm-sized particles of copper and iron accelerated to 2–20 km s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in a 2 MV van de Graaff accelerator. Ions were produced by impact with the tantalum target plate and accelerated through a reflectron on to a microchannel plate. The Dustbuster was considerably smaller and lighter than previous dust analysers and its novel ion optics gave good mass resolution (typically 150–350, <span class="italic">m</span>/Δ<span class="italic">m</span>, for Cu and Fe) combined with a large sampling area. The accuracy of the analysis was limited by the complicated ionization mechanism in impacts involving charged microparticles.</span><p class="otherpara">The standard method for the determination of <small><sup>15</sup></small>N abundance in total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in aqueous samples, based on Kjeldahl digestion and either distillation or diffusion to isolate ammonium, is both time-consuming and laborious. A new approach to the determination of both N content and <small><sup>15</sup></small>N abundance of TDN in aqueous samples involved a <span class="italic">TOC analyser coupled to a quadrupole EIMS instrument</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> Several fundamental requirements had to be met. The carrier gas (He–O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) had to be completely free of N<small><sub>2</sub></small> and with the O<small><sub>2</sub></small> content at the minimum needed for quantitative oxidation of the sample. There had to be no conversion or dilution of the product NO leaving the TOC analyser and low formation of NO in the ion source. The method was rapid (15 min analysis time) and acceptably precise, but suffered from a number of limitations. Fluctuations in the O<small><sub>2</sub></small> content during combustion caused variable background signals in the mass spectrometer. This was overcome by coupling the TOC analyser to the mass spectrometer through a trap and flush interface. A severe memory effect could only be overcome by running five replicates in series and rejecting the first two or three results. A strong dependence of the <small><sup>15</sup></small>N measurement on the N concentration in the sample, in particular at ≤10 µg N, had to be corrected for using an exponential relationship. The precision was sufficient to determine <small><sup>15</sup></small>N at 0.5 atom% if ≥50 µg of N were available per analysis. Correspondingly less N was required for higher <small><sup>15</sup></small>N abundances. The LOD was 2 µg per analysis, corresponding to 0.7 mg l<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in a maximum sample volume of 3 ml. The whole procedure was controlled manually and further development was required to produce an automated system suitable for routine analysis.</p><p class="otherpara">A novel <span class="italic">spark combustion reactor</span> was designed for the quantitative determination of <small><sup>13</sup></small>C in highly-enriched hydrocarbons.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a> The reactor was loaded with the gaseous sample and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> using a steel gas manifold and a high voltage applied using a platinum-electrode spark plug.

The source of this CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was suspected to be carbon contained within the interior walls of the reactor and on the spark plug surfaces.
