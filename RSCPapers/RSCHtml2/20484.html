The growth in popularity of LIBS is rapid, with applications being published for most sample types. This is undoubtedly because of its capability to analyse <span class="italic">in situ</span> on a production line (hence saving time and money) and its minimally destructive nature meaning that both forensic and cultural heritage samples may be analysed. It also has a standoff analysis capability meaning that hazardous materials, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> explosives or nuclear materials, may be analysed from a safe distance. The use of mathematical algorithms in conjunction with LIBS to enable improved accuracy has proved a popular area of research. This is especially true for ferrous and non-ferrous samples. Similarly, chemometric techniques have been used with LIBS to aid in the sorting of polymers and other materials. An increase in the number of papers in the subject area of alternative fuels was noted. This was at the expense of papers describing methods for the analysis of crude oils. For nanomaterials, previous years have seen a huge number of single particle and field flow fractionation characterisations. Although several such papers are still being published, the focus seems to be switching to applications of the nanoparticles and the mechanistic aspects of how they retain or bind with other analytes. This is the latest review covering the topic of advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials. It follows on from last year’s review<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–6</span></sup></a> and is part of the Atomic Spectrometry Updates series.</p></div><hr/>
    
      
      <h2 id="sect400"><span class="a_heading">1 Metals</span></h2>
      <span>The largest single topic researched in the area of the atomic spectrometric analysis of metals in this review period has been that of <span class="italic">laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS</span>). This is especially true for the ferrous metals where LIBS can be used at the production line, providing real-time analysis and hence cutting costs.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">There have been three review papers that have discussed the application of LIBS. One by Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> discussed, with 168 references, the accuracy improvement that has happened to calibration free LİBS in recent years (mainly since 2010). Calibration-free LIBS was first proposed in 1999, but its use has been limited because it does not provide the same accuracy as other LIBS techniques or of more traditional methods of analysis. The review discussed methods for the accurate measurement of spectral intensity, the spatial and temporal window of local thermal equilibrium and the accurate calculation of temperature and the electron number density. Also discussed was the use of standard samples in combination with the calibration free LIBS algorithm. The authors acknowledge that this loses some of the advantages, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it is no longer truly calibration-free, but since it is a new direction of research, it was included. The review’s final section offered conclusions and their perspectives for future research. A review by Noll <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> was entitled ‘LIBS analyses for industrial applications – an overview of developments from 2014 to 2018’. It contained 39 references and focused on the combined use of in-line measured three-dimensional geometry information and LİBS for high speed sorting tasks, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> of refractories. Also included were identification of steel blooms in a rolling mill and the recovery of valuable materials from the end of life electronic goods. The authors emphasised that LİBS instrumentation can be used in exceptionally harsh environments with measuring distances often between a few cm and a few metres from the sample. In general, the closer to the material the smaller the spectrometer need be. A discussion of the commercial hand-held spectrometers, several of which have been produced recently, was also presented. The third review was of a more general type and covered LIBS mapping in the biomedical, geological and industrial flields.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> This review presented (with 151 references) descriptions of the recent instrumental configurations, data processing methodologies and applications relating to LIBS-based imaging. The instrumental configurations discussed including the scanning configuration, the focusing systems, laser properties and spectral detection tools.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect413"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>In addition to the review by Noll, discussed previously, numerous applications of LIBS have also been reported. A large number of these have used a chemometric tool to aid in regression or to aid classification of steel type. The first topic to be discussed in detail will be those papers that have described the <span class="italic">chemometric tools used to aid regression</span>. Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> developed a LIBS device and tested it for the determination of alloying elements, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Cr, Mn, Ni and Ti in low-alloy steel samples. The low spectral resolution of the spectrometer (0.9 nm) ensured that it was impossible to resolve these elements spectrally from other species. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was therefore employed to extract the unresolved spectral features enabling calibration and quantification. This still proved to be very difficult for the congested part of the spectrum in which the Cr and Ti were being measured. It was, therefore, decided to use the first derivatives of the LIBS spectra. This enhanced the performance of the spectrometer further. Singh and Sarkar<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> also used PLSR and compared its performance in terms of accuracy and precision with Principal Component Regression (PCR). Identical LIBS spectra from stainless steel samples were used for the comparison. A detailed study was undertaken of the role of the two algorithms so that an understanding of how they form the regression could be obtained. It was concluded that there were situations where both algorithms are equally appropriate and other situations where the use of one would be more suitable than the other. These situations were identified and some guidelines for other users presented.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Many papers have used <span class="italic">machine learning or similar algorithms</span> to “train” models to aid analysis. They usually use a series of samples to train a model and then test the model on ‘unknown’ samples. Analysis at elevated temperature is regarded as being less accurate than when undertaken at room temperature. Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> attempted to overcome this problem to reduce costs and enhance the potential of on-line analysis. They collected LIBS data at room temperature and then applied ‘transfer learning’ to the spectra obtained at higher temperature. Fifteen standard samples were used to train the model at room temperature and four at elevated temperature. A further three “test” samples were then analysed at elevated temperature. The model was tested for determining Cr in certified alloy steel samples. The proposed method reduced the average absolute and relative errors by 1.8% and 20.6%, respectively. Mei <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> attempted to overcome the self-absorbance interferences and matrix effects that can be so prevalent in LIBS analyses. A multivariate calibration approach called genetic algorithm-kernel extreme learning machine (GA-KELM) was used to enable the quantification of Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Si, Ti and V in 47 certified steel and iron samples. A full description of the complex process was given. The performance of the model in terms of <span class="italic">R</span>-squared factor and root mean square errors of calibration were favourable compared with those obtained using traditional partial least squares. The conclusion was that the method could reduce matrix and self-absorption effects during LIBS analyses. Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> also attempted to overcome interference effects during LIBS analyses. They developed a semi-supervised quantitative analysis procedure that was based on a co-training regression model using a selection of effective unlabelled samples. Again, a large number of samples of known composition were used to train the model (11 CRMs) and five samples were used as labelled concentrations. The model was tested on seven other CRM samples for the determination of Cr in high alloy steel samples. A full description of the construction of the model was given. Results were impressive, with the root mean square error decreasing from 1.80% to 0.84% and the relative prediction error decreasing from 9.15% to 4.04%. The other paper of this type that deserves mention was presented by Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> This paper also reported improved accuracy of LIBS analyses, this time using a hybrid sparse partial least squares and a least squares support vector machine model. The models were used to determine total Fe and the oxides Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> CaO, MgO and SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in iron ore samples. Again, 24 samples were used to train the model and only 12 used for prediction. The two models were used for different things: the sparse partial least squares was used to select variables and establish the multi-linear regression model between spectral data and concentrations and the least squares – support vector machine was used to compensate for non-linear effects. The hybrid model out-performed either of the two individual models with root mean square error of prediction values of 0.0456, 0.0962, 0.642, 0.2157 and 0.359, for total, Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, CaO Fe, and MgO, SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> respectively.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Many of the mathematical models used for aiding regression have also been used for <span class="italic">classification processes</span>. A paper by Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> compared the use of partial least squares – discriminant analysis with a support vector machine approach to classify different steel types. Forty steels with similar composition were analysed using LIBS. The spectra were then treated using the two algorithms with the partial least squares providing discrimination between 96.25% of the samples and the support vector machine 95%. The paper then described how a hybrid of the two algorithms was made, called least squares support vector machine, which yielded 100% discrimination efficiency. Shin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> used LIBS followed by PCA to distinguish between different stainless steels, cast steels, aluminium alloys and copper alloys. A PCA of the full LIBS spectra provided good discrimination power but at the expense of computing time. This is a potential problem when used for sorting in the scrap metal industry as many hundreds of samples per day may require analysis. Consequently, the authors decreased the number of variables input to the PCA model. This was achieved by first obtaining full LIBS spectra and then using PCA to identify the input variables of greater significance for each element to be determined. The PCA was then repeated only on these more significant variables for future analyses. Although discrimination was marginally less good than PCA on the full spectra, the computational time required was decreased by a factor of at least 20. Xie <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> developed a novel method to achieve precise compositional prediction of steel samples based on wavelet packet transform and relevance vector machine (a machine learning technique that uses Bayesian inferences to obtain solutions for regression and probabilistic classification) analysis of LIBS data. The authors discussed the algorithms and how the spectral features extracted using the wavelet packet transform differed from those extracted using the traditional method. Using the absolute error of prediction and the mean relative error as measurement criteria, the wavelet packet transform out-performed the traditional method for extracting relevant spectral features to be introduced to the relevance vector machine. A better performance of the relevance vector machine was achieved through a modified Laplacian kernel function. The mean values of the root mean square error prediction of the modified relevance vector machine, the calibration curve, the unmodified relevance vector machine and the support vector machine were 0.159, 0.210, 0.303 and 0.179, respectively. It was concluded that the use of the wavelet packet transform of LIBS data followed by the modified relevance vector machine possessed superior efficiency generalisation ability and robustness for accurate and reliable compositional prediction.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Three papers discussed the analysis of <span class="italic">steels used in the nuclear industry</span>. In one paper, a LIBS spectrometer was developed that utilised a fibre-optic to deliver the laser energy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> The spectrometer design was presented and the authors optimised the distance between the end of the fibre-optic and the sample. A clear optimum, based on the maximal spectral intensity and minimal spectral fluctuations, was observed. When the distance was too short, self-absorption was observed and too long a distance led to plasma density and temperature dissipating after as little as 1 μs. The spectrometer developed was then used under optimal conditions to determine Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni and Si in Z3CN20-09 steel samples, which are normally used for structural materials in the pipelines of nuclear power plants. The same research group also used this instrument for the analysis of both Z3CN20-09 and 16MND5 steels, the second of which is used for the nuclear reactor pressure vessels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> Under the same incidence laser power, the plasma from the Z3CN20-09 produced significantly lower emission intensity compared with the 16MNDS steel. This was attributed to it containing Cr at much higher concentration. This led to problems for calibration between different sample types. The authors reported the use of internal standardisation, support vector machine and random forest regression calibrations being established. Under optimal conditions, the Cr present at a concentration of 19.3% in the Z3CN20-09 was determined with a relative error of 3.5%, whereas when it was present at trace amounts (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 0.11% in the 16MND5) the best root mean square error of prediction was 0.032% by weight. The Mn content which was present at between 1.19 and 1.51% by weight in both steels, was determined with a relative error of approximately 10%. The third paper used LIBS to analyse type 316 stainless steel weld parts that had been corroded by exposure to liquid lithium for 30 days at 450 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> Repeated analysis of the same spot enabled depth-profile analysis with sub-micron depth resolution to be obtained. The extent of penetration of Li in the steel matrix was a measure of the level of corrosion.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">measurement of the corrosion of steels</span> is another topic of interest. As well as the paper by Ke <span class="italic">et al.</span> above,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> several others have been published during this review period. Many of these have come from one group who also specialised in using LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22–24</span></sup></a> In the first, they used LIBS to obtain temporally and spatially resolved analysis of T91 steel which is used extensively for building industrial pressure-bearing heat exchange surfaces. The surfaces of several samples of the steel that had been aged to different extents were analysed and atom to ion line ratios and matrix element to alloying element ratios measured. The spectrometer and analytical procedure were described in full. For lesser aged steel, the maximum line intensity was located at greater height above the sample at a delay time of between 300 and 700 ns. Conversely, the steels aged to a greater extent gave maximum intensity just above their surface for the same time delay range. The line intensity ratios were dependent on the delay time and on the age of the steel. In addition, it was also noted that the depth and volume of the craters left from the LIBS analysis depended on sample age, with older samples providing deeper craters with greater volume. The second and third of the papers<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23,24</span></sup></a> both used chemometric packages to assist in the estimation of the steel aging process. Lu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> analysed eight T91 and seven 12CrMoV steels and then used ANOVA and logistic regression filter to reduce the number of LIBS variables into a smaller, more manageable number for introduction to the classification models logistic regression and support vector machine. Three different feature selection methods were tested and their effects on the models discussed. The performance of the models could be improved to some degree by implementation of all of the feature selection methods. However, one called layered interval wrapper performed the best. For T91 steel the prediction accuracy improved to 0.92 for logistic regression and 0.94 for the support vector machine when the layered interval wrapper was used to streamline the data. Without its use, prediction was less impressive (0.76 and 0.81). Results were less impressive for the 12MoCrV steels, but prediction accuracy still improved from 0.69 for both models to 0.87 for logistic regression and 0.90 for support vector machine. Unsurprisingly, it was concluded that the layered interval wrapper is a very effective feature selection method. The final paper by this research group<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> also analysed T91 steels with different degrees of micro-structure ageing and then used a range of multivariate analysis methods to correlate the surface hardness (measured using emission line intensity) with age. These methods included PCA, canonical correlation analysis (both used to identify the important variables from the entire spectrum), and then two regression algorithms to form calibrations using the selected variables: partial least squares regression and support vector regression. Results demonstrated that coupling canonical correlation analysis with support vector regression enabled a hardness estimation to be made from spectral line intensity. Maximum values for mean relative error, RSD and root mean square error of prediction were 2.47%, 2.94% and 6.14, respectively. The other papers in this research area used methods other than LIBS. Barlow <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> used X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) as well as XRF to characterise erosion at a buried polymer–steel interface. The samples were exposed to high pH potash brine to induce corrosion. The XRF was used to determine Cl, Fe, K and Mn and then construct maps so that areas of anodic pits could be identified. The XANES was used to determine the phase of the Fe corrosion products present. The second paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> was very similar. The XRF maps were produced using an excitation energy just above the metallic Fe K-edge threshold. The maps produce a sharp contrast between areas with and without corrosion. The μ-XANES was again used for confirmation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Calibration free LIBS</span> is a technique that is rapid, low-cost and is highly adaptable. However, it suffers badly from problems associated with self-absorption from major elements, it has few usable spectral lines from trace elements and requires correction of the relative efficiency of the experimental system. This means that accuracy and long term stability of calibration free LIBS can be compromised very easily. Several papers have described methodologies to overcome these deficiencies. As discussed previously, a recent development has been to combine calibration-free LIBS algorithms with standards. Although some advantages are lost, the overall effect is an improvement in accuracy. Hao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> used an instrument made in-house and a two point standardisation method to measure the trace elements Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Si, Ti and V in low alloy steel samples. The method was described in detail in the paper and was used prior to quantitative analysis of real samples. Six test samples were analysed every 24 hours for three days. Instrumental drift was effectively overcome using the two point calibration method. In addition, the average relative errors of repeated measurements decreased by 11, 3, 15, 45, 54, 16, 32, 91 and 11% for Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Si, Ti and V, respectively when compared with data obtained without the standardisation. A method using a standard reference line combined with one point calibration was described by Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> who determined six analytes in three stainless steels and five heat-resistant steels. The Stark broadening and Saha–Boltzmann plot for Fe was used to calculate the electron number density and plasma temperature, respectively. The standard reference line method alone was compared with the standard reference line method combined with one point calibration in an attempt to overcome the aforementioned problems with calibration-free LIBS. The combined use of the two methods improved the accuracy of the quantitative analysis. In addition, careful examination of the intercept along with the one-point calibration also improved the LOD. One point calibration was also employed by Hao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> who also used multi-line calibration to determine Cr, Mn, Ni and Ti in low alloy steel samples. A combination of the methods led to improvements in the average relative errors by 22, 9, 21 and 36% for Cr, Mn, Ni and Ti, respectively. The advantages of the system are that it does not require a large number of standard samples, has no complicated calculations and it provides a flexible, low cost quantitative LIBS analysis method.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">As described previously, there is huge potential for <span class="italic">LIBS to be employed at the production line</span> of steel plants. This saves time, money and modifications to formulations can be made rapidly. Two papers have discussed such an application. Zeng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> combined a near IR instrument with a LIBS system to measure the temperature and the composition of molten carbon steel simultaneously. This was because the combined system utilised the same optical system and the same light collection fibre optic. The full schematic of the system was presented in the paper. Method validation for the thermometry was achieved by comparison with data from a commercial pyrometer. The relative root mean square error between the two was only 0.95%. The relative standard errors of Cr and Mn detection were lower than 10%. The other paper, by Cabalin <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> described the installation and use of a stand-off, on-line LIBS system at a steel production plant in Bilbao. The LIBS system had been reported in a previous publication. The present paper discussed its installation 3.6 m from the hot billet in the continuous casting line and then its optimisation. Its positioning just before the oxy-cutting unit was ideal because it is at this point that billets of different steels need to be identified. Minor constituents such as Pb (from 0 to 0.17%) or V (0 to 0.1%) were useful in aiding discrimination between different steel types. The results from the system were compared with those obtained using an off-line LIBS system in a laboratory and with those from optical emission spectrometry. The results from all three were in good agreement. They were also in agreement with a mathematical model designed to predict the temporal evolution of the elemental content in the intermix region.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There is a large number of more simple applications of the analysis of iron and steels. One of the more novel of these was reported by Hegetschweiler <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> who described the use of <span class="italic">single particle ICP-MS for the determination of titanium and niobium carbonitride precipitates</span> in acid digests of micro-alloyed steels. The composition and particle size distribution of these particles are of importance for the mechanical properties of the steel. The single particle ICP-MS methodology is normally used for the analysis of nanoparticles, so this was a real application useful to industry. The results obtained from the ICP-MS were compared with those from electron microscopy. The single particle ICP-MS analysed over 2000 particles in one minute whereas the electron microscopy method could analyse far fewer. Both techniques identified two distinct particle populations: smaller particles contained only Nb and larger particles that contained both Nb and Ti. Electron microscopy also yielded information on the morphology of the particles. The larger ones were complex and ‘overgrown’ structures. The combination of the two techniques enabled a better understanding of the precipitation process that forms the particles during steel production at different stages of the thermo-mechanical – rolling process. This, in turn, would help improve the rolling process and help production.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two applications have used <span class="italic">ICP-MS to determine analytes in ferrous materials</span>. In one by Steenstra<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> laser ablation-ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) was used to determine analytes in iron-rich alloys. The premise of the work was to assess the matrix effects that occur when calibration is against glass standards rather than matrix matched standards. This was achieved using a 193 nm excimer laser system operating at ns firing times to ablate the materials and then compare the data obtained with those from electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Measurements from LA-ICP-MS consistently overestimated the concentration of volatile elements and under-estimated the concentrations of non-volatile elements compared with EPMA data. An attempt to quantify the matrix interferences was made resulting in the fractionation index being presented. This index was independent of the concentration and on the type of iron-rich alloy under analysis. Values for the fractionation index ranged from 0.14 for the most volatile analyte to 1.8 for the most refractory element. The authors then used their findings to interrogate previously published data and to calculate metal-silicate partition coefficients. Comparison was made between corrected and uncorrected LA-ICP-MS data, where the corrected data were obtained by multiplying the uncorrected data by the appropriate fractionation index. Results demonstrated that erroneous data would be used if correction were not undertaken. The conclusion was that such a correction should be made for all samples of this type when analysed using LA-ICP-MS with this type of laser. A study by Wada <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> determined ultra-trace S in high purity metals including zinc and iron using isotope dilution-sector field-ICP-MS (ID-SF-ICP-MS). After dissolution of the metal, a chromatographic separation of the S from the metal matrix was undertaken using an alumina column. This served two functions: to prevent polyatomic interferences arising from the metal matrix and to prevent signal suppression arising from space-charge effects. The sector field instrument used was also capable of removing polyatomic interferences through use of medium resolution mode. Operating parameters such as detector dead time (that affects precision) and the washout conditions (to remove the possibility of memory effects) were optimised. The method was validated through analysis of the iron CRM JSS-001-4. The result obtained (1.86 ± 0.12 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) was in good agreement with the certified value (1.90 ± 0.40 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Three papers also reported <span class="italic">applications for steel analysis using LIBS</span>. Amongst this number is one by Zeng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> who described the use of a portable fibre-optic LIBS system for the determination of the minor elements Cr, Mn, Ti and V in steel and pig iron. The <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values for the calibration curves for the four analytes were all better than 0.99 and their root mean square errors of cross-validation were 0.0501, 0.0054, 0.0205 and 0.0245 weight percent for Mn, Ti, V and Cr, respectively. Six test samples were used with average relative errors being 5.6, 2.5, 11.7 and 13.0% for Cr, Mn, Ti and V, respectively. The data were comparable to those obtained using a normal LIBS setup. A paper by Cui <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> described the use of a collinear long-short double pulse LIBS system for the determination of Mn in steel washer samples. The long pulse (60 μs) was generated using a Nd:YAG laser operated in free running mode. The performance of the long-short double pulse LIBS was compared with that of the single pulse version. When operated under the same conditions, the double pulse LIBS had far superior linearity of calibration (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> of 0.988) compared with the single pulse LIBS (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.810) and had greater sensitivity. The second of these was attributed to the pre-irradiation effect. In addition, precision was also improved (10.5% RSD compared with 29.3% for single pulse LIBS). The biggest effect of the double pulse LIBS was on the average relative error of prediction which was 4.9% compared with the huge value of 94.9% obtained using only single pulse. The last paper of interest in this section was presented by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> who used μ-LIBS assisted by laser induced fluorescence (LIF) to determine Si in low alloy steels. The presence of Si in steels has an important role in hardness and strength improvement. Unfortunately, it also leads to increased problems with corrosion and is harmful to ductility and therefore its concentration requires monitoring. The paper described the analytical setup and the mechanism by which the LIF assists the μ-LIBS. A comparison of analytical figures of merit for both the μ-LIBS-LIF and for μ-LIBS alone under their individual optimal working conditions indicated that the combination was far superior. The μ-LİBS-LIF yielded a calibration with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> of 0.9998, a LOD of 2.8 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 63 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. To the authors’ knowledge, this was the first time a LOD of less than 10 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> had been reported using LIBS.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect509"><span class="b_heading">1.2 Non-ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>The readers’ attention should be drawn to the review papers discussed in Section 1, since these are equally applicable to the analysis of non-ferrous materials. As with the ferrous metals, LIBS continues to increase in popularity. In common with the applications for ferrous metals, one of the most popular areas of study has been the use of <span class="italic">algorithms to improve the accuracy of measurement, to overcome interferences or to improve the long term stability</span>. An example was presented by Pan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> who described an efficient procedure for the construction and selection of calibration models for LIBS analysis. The procedure included the data pre-processing, construction of the calibration model and then the calculation of analyte concentrations in the samples. All of these steps could be pre-programmed with no further manual intervention. Using the developed procedure, the concentrations of 10 analytes were determined in nickel-based alloys. Most analytes had an average relative standard error of less than 10%. Zhan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> used the machine learning algorithm called random forest for pattern recognition of LIBS spectra to aid in the classification of different aluminium alloys. As with the majority of such papers, a training set of samples is required for the model to function correctly. Once trained, the model can be used for test or unknown samples. The best classification accuracy obtained was 98.59%. The accuracy was dependent on the number of trees in the random forest and on the size of the training set of samples. It was concluded that LIBS with random forest provides a rapid, accurate and precise way of classifying aluminium alloys. Owolabi and Gondal<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> also used algorithms to improve the performance of LIBS. They used a hybridisation of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM – a non-linear method that can approximate any non-linear relation) and Support Vector Regression (SVR – a non-linear tool based on learning theory). The former can, on occasion, suffer from over-fitting which can effect its accuracy. The SVR overcomes the problem of over-fitting if its parameters are properly optimised. The hybrid algorithm was used with LIBS analysis of seven standards bronze samples. A comparison of ELM-SVR, SVR-ELM, SVR and ELM was made, with best data in terms of root mean square error, being obtained for ELM-SVR. Each of the models had their hyper-parameters optimised using a gravitational search algorithm prior to the comparison. Three different normalisation techniques were compared by Sattar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a> for the minimisation of matrix effects during the LIBS analysis of silver–zinc binary compounds. These methods were: normalisation with background, internal normalisation and three point smoothing. The LIBS spectra of five composites were determined using various laser irradiances, with calibration for the Ag being at 338.28 nm and the Zn at 481.053 nm. The slopes of the calibration graphs provided an evaluation of the matrix effects. After optimising the parameter settings, the best analytical results were obtained using the three point smoothing normalisation method which yielded calibration curves with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of between 0.995 and 0.998. Two papers were published by the same research group who explored ways of improving accuracy for different LIBS systems.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42,43</span></sup></a> In one,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> Fe, Mg and Zn were determined in aluminium alloys using fibre optic-LIBS. Use of spatially resolved fibre optic-LIBS enabled the workers to collect spectra at different positions along a direction parallel to the surface of the sample rather than from the centre of the plasma. By selecting different acquisition positions along the <span class="italic">X</span>-axis, it was possible to overcome problems associated with self-absorption. Root mean square errors of cross validation were improved from 0.388 to 0.172, 0.348 to 0.224 and from 0.097 to 0.024 weight% for Fe, Mg and Zn, respectively. In the other application<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> a method of calibration entitled ‘Single Sample Calibration’ was developed and tested for the determination of several major elements (Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ni and Zn) in three sets of matrix matched certified samples. A full description of the method was given. Compared with multi-point calibration, the results were much improved. Using Cu as an example, the <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> value, the root mean square error of cross validation and the average relative error improved from 0.40 to 0.97, 3.55 to 0.76 weight% and from 5.19 to 1.05%, respectively. The average RSD also decreased from 16.22 to 1.15%. The average relative error was dependent on the concentration range of the analyte, but was less than 5% for all ranges except 0–10 weight%, where it was 5.16%. For much higher concentration ranges, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> 90–100% the average relative error was 0.44%. Another paper to discuss the use of a chemometrics package in conjunction with LIBS was by Shin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> This paper was discussed in detail in Section 1.1.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Partial least squares regression was used by Takahashi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> for the <span class="italic">underwater LIBS analysis of brass samples</span>. The concentrations of Cu and Zn were determined using several different signal processing steps. These included normalisation, smoothing and background subtraction. Eleven certified brass samples were analysed to ascertain accuracy. Of the processing steps used, the normalisation provided the best results because it reduced the effects of both peak and background fluctuations. Database segmentation by excitation temperature further improved the partial least squares calculations. The method was applicable to real-time analysis and could potentially be used for fast, accurate and automated analysis at oceanic pressure.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One paper described the use of <span class="italic">LIBS in situ</span> to provide <span class="italic">multi-elemental analysis and detect failures in an additive manufacturing process</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> A compact LIBS instrument was designed and installed on an industrial robot for real time analysis of the formation of a highly resistant coating of nickel alloy reinforced with tungsten carbide particles. The positioning of the probe within the production line had to be chosen carefully because of the inhomogeneity of the tungsten carbide particles in the upper surface layer. Scanning electron microscopy was used to check that the LIBS sampling had no deleterious effect on the cladding process. The LIBS analysis of the main elements (Ni and W) yielded data in good agreement with those obtained using offline XRF measurements. The conclusion was that LIBS was a very good prospect for the on-line measurement of the cladding process. A similar paper was also presented by Lednev <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46</span></sup></a> who used LIBS to quantify loose metal powders by first attaching them to double-sided tape. The technique reportedly worked even for materials of very different particle density, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> tungsten carbide and nickel alloy powder. Again, the methodology was validated by offline XRF analysis. A third similar paper by the same group was also reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit47"><sup><span class="sup_ref">47</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers discussed calibration free LIBS analysis of non-ferrous samples. In one by Mal <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48</span></sup></a> a thorough explanation of what is required for calibration-free LIBS, and why, was given. Accuracy is known to depend enormously on obtaining optically thin conditions (since self-absorption occurs at optically thick conditions) and local thermal equilibrium. Evaluation of the temporal evolution of the plasma enabled the authors to identify the optimal temporal window where both of these fundamental criteria were met. This was achieved by studying the plasma temperature through the emissions of atomic Cu <span class="italic">via</span> a Boltzmann plot and estimating electron number density through the Stark broadening of the profile of the Cu ion wavelength at 510.5 nm. These estimates were then inserted to a one-line calibration-free LIBS algorithm to determine the percentage composition of three copper alloys. Results were in good agreement with those obtained using EDX. The other paper, by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> corrected for self-absorption effects during calibration-free-LIBS using a new method which they entitled ‘black body radiation referenced self-absorption correction’. An algorithm was devised that calculated plasma temperatures and collection efficiency of the optical collection setup by comparing the measured spectrum with the corresponding theoretical black body radiation for self-absorption correction. The proposed method had several advantages over existing methods including simpler programming, higher computational efficiency and independence from line-broadening coefficients that, even if available, may not be very accurate. Titanium alloy samples were used as the testing materials. Correction of self-absorption effects was demonstrated by improved linearity of the Boltzmann plots and accuracy of the analysis was also improved when compared with data obtained when the algorithm was not used.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Three papers have discussed the use of <span class="italic">laser ablation-spark induced breakdown spectroscopy</span> (LA-SIBS) for the analysis of copper alloys,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> aluminium alloys<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a> and both brass and aluminium alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> This technique uses a spark to re-excite a plasma produced by a laser ablation unit and then the light emitted is characterised and quantified. A Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and at a repetition rate of 1 kHz was used to ablate the samples in the first instance and then the spark was used to prolong the plasma and promote the breakdown of the ablated sample further. In one example,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a> the detection limits for Cr, Cu, Mg and Mn were 9, 7.8, 11.1 and 20.1 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> which represented improvements of 4–10 fold compared with ordinary LIBS. Precision was excellent, with RSD values of 3–4% being obtained. Another of the papers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> described the compact multi-channel fibre-based spectrometer used. Detection limits for Al and Pb using the system in a non-gated operation mode were 1.9 and 15.5 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>; again representing an improvement of between 6 and 11 fold compared with those obtained using LIBS alone under the same laser-ablation conditions. The third of the papers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> used a gated pulsed high voltage power supply as power source for the spark discharge and then studied the delay between the high voltage pulse and the laser pulse. The orientation of the electrodes was also studied. By changing electrode orientation and by increasing the time delay, it was possible to change the discharge from a V-shape to a parallel arrangement. Both configurations had advantages. The V-shaped discharge could ablate more sample and increase the diameters and depths of the craters, whereas the parallel arrangement was more discrete in that it did not ablate new sample area other than that already ablated by the laser. In the parallel configuration, emission intensity decreased with increasing time delay but increased with discharge voltage. Under optimal conditions, improvements in sensitivity were again reportedly 4–10 fold better than standard LIBS.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers have reported the <span class="italic">analysis of solder</span>. In one by Huang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> a forensic analysis of lead-tin solders was undertaken using ICP-MS. The authors pointed out that lead-tin solder is an integral part of many improvised explosive devices and therefore a forensic analysis of them could help in evidence gathering. Samples of solder (approx. 10 mg) were acid digested using 2 mL of nitric and 0.5 mL of hydrochloric acids and then heating to 150 °C. After further addition of nitric (8 mL) and hydrochloric (2 mL) acids, the digest was diluted to 50 mL. Samples were then diluted a further 100-fold prior to analysis. The analytes Bi, Cu, Ni and Sb as well as Pb and Sn were then determined. External calibration was achieved through acid digestion and appropriate dilution of the standard solder sample NIST SRM 1131. Eight different solder samples were analysed and distinguishable differences between the analytes were observed enabling a discrimination to be made. The authors then extended the study to see the effects of a heating gun on two different solder types. An increase in Cu concentration was observed for the sample with a rosin core. This contamination could, according to the authors, be used to provide information on the type of soldering gun used if the solder used contained a rosin core. The other paper described the use of LA-ICP-MS to analyse lead-free solder chips.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> The analytes Ag, Cu, Pb and Sn were determined. Calibration was achieved using a standard solution matrix matched to the Sn content of the sample. This solution had to be prepared in nitric acid to prevent precipitation of Ag. This helped maintain linearity of the Ag calibration curve. Analysis of NMIJ CRM 8203-a provided data in good agreement with certified values as long as the fluence of the LA system was maintained at over 12 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. At fluences below that, elemental fractionation occurred. It was noticeable that uncertainty values were very high. This was attributed to potential inhomogeneity of the sample at the micro-scale.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A host of other disparate applications have been published. These included a <span class="italic">room temperature chelate vapour generation</span> prior to atomic fluorescence detection for Ni determination in a variety of samples including aluminium alloy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> The alloy (0.1 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of 6 M HCl. The presence of methanol or ethanol at a concentration of 2% v/v enhanced vapour generation by a factor of 2.6. Under optimal conditions, a vapour formation efficiency of 50% was achieved. The LOD was 1.12 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and precision at 40 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<span class="italic">n</span> = 10) was 2.9%. The mechanism of formation of the Ni-diethyldithiocarbamate chelate vapour was not fully understood and will be examined in future work. Alkali and alkaline earth elements caused no interference, but transition elements, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Fe, Mn and Zn did – even at quite low concentration. These interfering ions had to be removed using a solvent-impregnated resin with a tertiary amine extractant prior to the vapour generation step. The method was validated through the analysis of a certified water sample (GSB07-3186-2014) and digests of a certified aluminium alloy (LD2). Results were in good agreement with certified values.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">analysis of high purity metals</span> has been the subject of three papers. One by Medvedev <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> described the analysis of high purity cadmium. The solid sample was weighed into an electrothermal vaporisation (ETV) device prior to detection using ICP-OES. The temperature program of the ETV device was optimised and an ash/char temperature of 900 °C was sufficiently high to remove the cadmium matrix. The analytes (Al, Au, Be, Bi, Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, In, Mn, Ni, Re, Sn and V) were then vaporised at 2400 °C and transferred to the ICP-OES instrument for detection. Detection limits were improved by a factor of between 3 and 670 when compared with ICP-OES using a 2% cadmium solution and conventional nebulisation. No suitable CRM was available and so method validation was through an independent technique (ICP-MS) and through spike/recovery experiments. It is noticeable that Cu, Pb and Zn are not among the analytes. This is presumably because they will also be at least partially lost at a char temperature of 900 °C. A paper by Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57</span></sup></a> described the analysis of high purity (5 N, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> better than 99.999% pure) cobalt powder using a triple quadrupole ICP-MS instrument. The sample was first dissolved using a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids with microwave assistance. The dissolved samples then underwent analysis using the instrument with a range of reaction gases being tested to overcome interferences. Addition of oxygen enabled the analytes As, P, S, Se and V to be determined at their respective oxide mass, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> AsO<small><sup>+</sup></small> at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 91, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Addition of hydrogen to the reaction cell helped shift interferences on Ca and Si enabling the two analytes to be determined at their own isotopic mass. A mixture of ammonia and helium introduced to the cell helped form cluster ions and enabled interference-free determination of Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Ti and Zn. The same reaction gas mixture also enabled Al, Mg and Na to be determined because polyatomic interferences on these analyte isotopes formed cluster ions and were, hence, shifted away from the measurement regions. In all cases, matrix effects were overcome by the on-line addition of internal standard elements. Detection limits were in the range 0.02–97.5 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and calibration curves demonstrated good linearity. Analyte spikes gave recoveries in the range 91.6–109%, which was deemed acceptable. The third paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit58"><sup><span class="sup_ref">58</span></sup></a> determined S in copper metal and copper alloys using isotope dilution (ID)-LA-ICP-MS. The aim of the study was to combine the benefits of ID and LA-ICP-MS to avoid the time-consuming and laborious sample preparation procedures (matrix separation) that are usually required for conventional ID-MS for the determination of S. The samples were spiked with the isotopically enriched solution, dissolved and then the resulting digests absorbed onto polyethylene frits. The frits were then analysed using LA-ICP-MS. The advantages of the method included the very low S signal in the blank samples and that spiking with known amounts of S showed that the frits absorbed more than 99.5% of the S. Calibration curves demonstrated good linearity up to 40 μg of S. The methodology was validated through the use of the reference materials BAM-376a, BAM-228 and BAM-227 which delivered 2, 5 and 11 μg of S to the frits, respectively. Pre-analysis of the samples using external calibration LA-ICP-MS had indicated values of 0.9, 5.1 and 8.5 μg g of S (measured at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 32). Results for the ID-LA-ICP-MS were compared with those using conventional ID-ICP-MS with Pearson’s coefficient correlating the two sets of data giving a value of 0.999. The relative expanded measurement uncertainty of the ID-LA-ICP-MS data ranged between 10 and 26%. The procedure was, according to the authors, traceable metrologically to the SI because of an unbroken chain of comparisons, each with their own uncertainty budget. The overall methodology was deemed to be reliable and acceptable.</p>

        <h3 id="sect600"><span class="b_heading">1.3 Cultural heritage: metals</span></h3>
        <span>With cultural heritage samples, it is usual to try and inflict as little damage as possible. This is true whether they be metal objects, ceramics, glasses or any other material. The premise, of course, is that there is little point in analysing priceless materials if they are to be destroyed or disfigured during the analysis. The use of analytical techniques that are either non-destructive (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> XRF) or minimally destructive (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> LA-ICP-MS/OES, LIBS) are therefore more common than other techniques. A review of LIBS analyses in cultural heritage samples was presented (with 212 references) by Botto <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> The review covered several material types including pottery, metals, pigments, glass <span class="italic">etc.</span> It also covered the use of different types of LIBS analysis and LIBS used in conjunction with other techniques, including Raman, XRF and MS. Specific applications, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> those analyses made under water and those used in support of restoration were also discussed. New trends for LIBS in the area were also discussed. These include μ-LIBS, 3D elemental imaging and nanoparticle enhanced LIBS.</span>

The LIBS analyses were undertaken for all sample types, an XRF instrument was used for the coins and a portable XRF instrument used for the pigments and ceramics and the PIXE was used to analyse pigments and ceramics. Both major and minor analytes were determined. The results were compared as were the possibilities for lateral and depth-resolved data. The PIXE was capable of best lateral resolution (1 μm) compared with the LIBS (10–50 μm) and the μ-XRF (50–100 μm). In all cases, the sensitivity decreased with the spot size. For depth resolution, the LIBS had by far the best resolution (1 μm compared with tens of μm for the other techniques).</p>

Solution 1 was ammonium chloride and ammonium carbonate, solution 2 was potassium chloride, copper sulfate pentahydrate and sodium sulfate decahydrate adjusted to pH 3 using sulfuric acid and solution 3 was copper nitrate and sodium chloride. After the corrosion period of up to three months, the samples were removed, and analysed using portable XRF. Cross-sections of the samples were also analysed using SEM-EDS. A chloride-based solution led to a de-cuprification and made the XRF data less accurate. This was attributed to a build up of tin compounds. Another problem was the onset of bronze disease, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the formation of atacamite and paratacamite. Using the “patina” and “metals” algorithms of the instrumental software enabled accurate information to be obtained from samples immersed in solutions 1 and 3.

        <span>Overcoming matrix effects remains a challenge within the analytical community; especially in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). This can impact the results. In order to establish the extent of matrix effects three binary organic mixtures were sputtered with argon and analysed utilising 25 keV Bi<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> and depth profiles obtained using SIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> It was observed that matrix effects approximately scale with mass to charge ratios as smaller effects were noted for low mass ions. In addition, the presence of hydrogen was crucial as the likelihood of charge transfer decreases after a loss of H<small><sup>+</sup></small> and therefore becomes less favourable. The authors discussed the theory of the observed phenomenon in great detail and could conclude that ion velocity, fragment chemistry and the point of secondary ion point of origin are all contributing factors to the observed matrix effects.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Routine <span class="italic">determination of Br</span> has been a challenge in AAS because of its resonance line lying in the UV region at 148.86 nm. Turhan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> therefore developed a method to determine Br <span class="italic">via</span> the molecular absorption of BaBr (520.819 nm). Following method optimisation, pyrolysis and volatilisation temperatures were set at 700 and 2200 °C, respectively. Neither Pd modifier nor a Zr coating was utilised in the developed method. The formation of molecular BaBr was achieved by using 10 μL of 25 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Ba. Spike recovery studies on commercial drug samples showed no significant non-spectral interferences. The characteristic mass was 4.0 ng with a method LOD of 1.7 ng. However, it was noticed that spike studies were only performed for two of the four drug samples present. It would have further supported the accuracy of the developed method had all four samples been investigated for their spike recovery. In addition, excellent linearity of <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.999 was reported. However, this had only been investigated for a range of up to 1 μg Br, which seems rather narrow. Nonetheless, it was a promising approach to enable Br detection using AAS.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect718"><span class="b_heading">2.2 Fuels and lubricants</span></h3>
        <span>This year the numbers of papers in this section has increased, particularly in the fields of crude oils and alternative fuels. There seems to have been a shift from conventional oil and crude oil analysis to more environmentally friendly alternatives, some somewhat unconventional such as Amazonian Sailfin Catfish. There also seems to be interest in using fly ash and other by-products as possible feed stocks for other industries such as REE extraction, possibly reflecting the global demand for these elements in the modern world and the subsequent increase in their price.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The analysis of coal has seen a decrease in papers this year, including in the number using LIBS. However, ETV seems to have had a renaissance as it is perceived to be more environmentally friendly than conventional sample dissolutions with solvents and acids. The technique of ETV was used by several authors as a sample introduction step linked to other instrumentation.</p>

The determination by difference of the total, non-volatile and volatile fractions containing Ni and V was carried out by assessing the differences in the thermal behaviour of the species during the pyrolysis step. The detection limits for Ni were 3.5 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for total content and 1.7 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the non-volatile fraction and for V 1.1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for total content and 0.42 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the non-volatile fraction.

          <p class="otherpara">The next paper of interest, by Wu <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> described a method for the <span class="italic">determination of As, Cd, Hg, Pb and S in fuels using ETV-ICP-MS</span>. The aim of this method was to simplify sample preparation from acid digestion or ashing to a simple emulsion step and to minimise interferences. The sample was introduced in the form of an emulsion and Pd used as a modifier. Oxygen was used in the dynamic reaction cell of the instrument and As was measured as AsO at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 91 and S as SO at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 48.

          <span>The first contribution in this section is from Henn <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> who assessed the <span class="italic">feasibility of As, Sb, Se and Te determination in coal using ETV-ICP-MS</span>. In order to overcome the limitations of sample preparation methods, ETV was proposed for the introduction of solid coal samples to the ICP-MS instrument. A permanent modifier was made on the graphite platform by adding a solution of 1000 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Ir to it and then drying using an IR lamp. Samples were weighed on to the graphite platform, which was then inserted into the furnace connected to the ICP-MS instrument. The analysis was acquired in peak hopping mode and the peak area integrated. The Ar dimer signal was monitored to compensate for plasma oscillations during the vaporisation step. Samples and the CRMs NIST1632b, NIST1632c and NIST1635 were also digested using a conventional method to compare with the new ETV method. Results from both methods showed good agreement with the certified values. The LOQs from the ETV method were 0.03 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As, 0.01 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Sb, 0.03 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Se and 0.006 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Te. These compared favourably with the LOQs obtained using the digestion method which were 0.02 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As, 0.04 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Sb, 0.07 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Se and 0.007 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Te.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Iqbal <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> was the first of two LIBS papers and investigated the <span class="italic">compositional analysis of Coal using calibration-free LIBS</span>. A high-power Q-switched Nd:YAG Laser, (532 nm, 5 ns pulse width and 10 Hz repetition rate) was used and the optical emission spectra were obtained using a HR 4000 spectrometer covering the wavelength region from 200 nm to 1100 nm. The emission spectrum contained the lines for Ca, Si, Fe, Ti, Mg, Na, K, Li, Al and C along with traces of Ba, Sr and Mn. The intensities of the observed spectral lines were corrected for self-absorption using the internal reference line. The excitation temperature was calculated using the Boltzmann plot method and the Stark broadened H-alpha line profile was used to determine the electron number density. A calibration-free technique with a fixed slope was used for the quantification of C and other elements and a laser-ablation time of flight LA-TOF-MS instrument was used to obtain mass spectra of the same samples. All the elements identified in the optical emission spectrum were also observed in the LA-TOF-MS mass spectrum. A CRM coal sample SARM 20 and a sample of the Pakistani Thar Coal were analysed. The values obtained for the CRM were in good agreement with the certified values. The second paper in this section to use LIBS was submitted by Yao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> who investigated the <span class="italic">LIBS spectral properties of coal with different volatile contents</span>. Five coal samples with different amounts of volatile components were analysed and were compared with the same coal samples after heating at 900 °C for 7 minutes to produce char samples. The intensities of nearly all the emission lines were lower for the raw samples than those of the char samples. This indicated that a large amount of energy from the laser pulse is used in the pyrolysis process causing variation in the elemental results. This was improved by using the char samples which showed less variation.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Zhu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> described an interesting new instrument for <span class="italic">laser ablation single particle aerosol mass spectrometry for the direct analysis of raw coal samples</span>. Particles were ablated from the surface of the solid material and these particles then entered the single particle aerosol mass spectrometry instrument for on-line simultaneous size and chemical composition analysis. The results were then processed by software to characterise the coal sample. The main components observed in the mass spectra of the samples included metallic and non-metallic elements, elemental carbon, organic carbon, and other compounds. The particles ablated from the five coal samples were divided into nine classes according to their primary chemical composition and were used as particle markers to characterise the coal samples. This approach avoided time-consuming chemical digestion procedures usually used for coal characterisation. Although the method has merit, further work on optimisation of the data analysis methodology is required to achieve the levels of accuracy required for its routine use.</p>

          <span>One review article containing 73 references from Sama <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84</span></sup></a> was of note in this section. It covered <span class="italic">recent trends in elemental speciation of crude oils and heavy petroleum fractions</span>. This article covers most techniques including GC-ICP-MS- and OES, LC-ICP-MS- and OES, TLC ICP-MS and GPC-ICP-MS and gives a reasonable overview of the current state of play of these techniques with regard to crude oils and their fractions. Another paper in this section was by Sanchez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> who looked at the <span class="italic">analysis of crude oil and heavy fractions using a high temperature torch integrated sample introduction system</span>. The elemental analysis of heavy cuts is problematic because of their high viscosity and because they require large dilution factors to avoid nebuliser blocking and matrix effects that are commonly seen with conventional solvent dilution work. The authors described a method using a low inner volume spray chamber with a wall temperature set at 400 °C. This increased the analyte transport efficiency to virtually 100% regardless of sample matrix allowing universal calibration for all matrix types. The resulting sensitivity was an order of magnitude higher than that seen using a conventional spray chamber and quantitation limits were reduced by a factor of between 2 and 20 depending on the sample and element considered. The high transport efficiency, lower sample dilution and narrower peaks also allowed increases in sample throughput by a factor of 2.</span>

This emulsion proved to be stable for 8 days. The accuracy of the procedure was evaluated through the analysis of standard reference materials NIST 1085b and NIST 1634c and by addition/recovery tests. The values obtained with this procedure were in accordance with the certified values for Ca, Mg and Na for both standard reference materials. Spike recoveries in crude oil were between 92.8 ± 3.8 and 102 ± 7.2% for all elements.</p>

This protocol which can be used on sample sizes as low as 5 mL used liquid–liquid extraction into an aqueous phase followed by standard anion-exchange column chromatography to separate the elements of interest. The sample was split into two aliquots with 95% being used for multicollector-ICP-MS isotopic determinations while the other 5% was used for conventional ICP-MS quantitative measurements. Reproducibility was on a par with routine state-of-the-art Pb and Zn isotopic measurements for other types of geological materials and procedural blanks were negligible relative to the amounts of Pb and Zn typically separated from the crude oils.</p>

A citric acid modifier was used to produce calibrations using aqueous solutions and pyrolysis and vaporisation temperatures were 700 and 2200 °C, respectively. Since the REE have the affinity to form refractory compounds inside the electrothermal vaporiser, the use of a modifier gas (Freon R-12) at a flow of 3.0 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was necessary for this analysis. The influence of sample quantity was evaluated, and accurate results were obtained even using a relatively high mass of crude oil (up to 18 mg). Accuracy was evaluated by comparison of these results with those obtained using ICP-MS with an ultrasonic nebulizer after a high pressure microwave assisted wet digestion and a microwave induced combustion procedure. No statistical difference was observed between the results. The limits of quantification for REE by ETV-ICP-MS were 0.02–0.8 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which were lower than those obtained using the ultrasonic nebulizer ICP-MS technique (0.6–5.1 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).

          <span>The first contribution in this section is from Lourenco <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> who described a method based on <span class="italic">reverse-phase dispersive liquid–liquid micro-extraction for the extraction and preconcentration of Ca K, Mg and Na in biodiesel samples.</span> Flame spectrometry was used for analysis in the emission mode for K and Na and in absorption mode for Ca and Mg. The extraction/preconcentration step of the analysis was performed using a mixture of isopropanol and HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>. The aqueous phase containing the analytes was separated by centrifugation. Parameters such as sample mass, volume of dispersant and extractant solutions, use of ultrasound, centrifugation time and temperature were evaluated. Analysis was performed using external calibration with aqueous reference solutions. The LOQ for Ca, K, Mg and Na was 0.05, 0.02, 0.08 and 0.04 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. The accuracy was evaluated by recovery tests, which ranged from 93.9 to 108.1%, with a precision of better than 3% RSD for all analytes. The proposed method was then applied to five biodiesel samples produced from different raw materials. Compared with conventional sample preparation techniques this method was simple, low cost with low reagent consumption and provides LOQ values significantly below the limits required for these elements in biodiesel. A similar extraction method was proposed by da Silva <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> This method was developed for the determination of Ca, K, Mg and Na in biodiesel using AAS and was based on the extraction of the analytes into a ‘micro drop’ of an acid/alcohol extraction solution at the bottom of a conical tube. The best results were obtained with a sample mass of 3.0 g and 780 μL of 5.0% (v/v) HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>/isopropyl alcohol at a ratio of 3<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1. The efficiency of the sample preparation procedure was evaluated using a recovery test, with recoveries within 90.2–94.7% for all elements being obtained at a precision of better than 2%. The LOD were 32.3, 5.8, 4.3 and 3.0 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Ca, K, Mg and Na, respectively.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A similar approach was also used by Vinhal <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> for <span class="italic">the GFAAS determination of Cu, Ni, Pb and V in gasolines containing ethanol</span>. This was an emulsion-breaking extraction method, again using HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and a short chain alcohol. After breaking the bottom phase containing water, the dispersing agent and ethanol were analysed using GFAAS. Recovery tests were performed and produced analyte recoveries of between 87 and 116%. The LODs for this method were 0.7, 0.1, 0.8 and 1.6 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cu, Ni, Pb and V, respectively.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An interesting method was proposed by Meira <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> who described the <span class="italic">determination of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and V in ethanol fuels using XRF after magnetic solid phase extraction using CoFe</span><small><sub><span class="italic">2</span></sub></small><span class="italic">O</span><small><sub><span class="italic">4</span></sub></small><span class="italic">nanoparticles impregnated with</span> 1-(2-pyridylazo)-naphthol. The extraction and preconcentration step was followed by direct determination of the analytes in the solid phase using EDXRF. The proposed method produced detection limits of: 0.013, 0.012, 0.012, 0.011, 0.016 and 0.009 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb and V, respectively. This method was then successfully applied to the extraction and determination of these analytes in ethanol fuel samples.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Barela <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> developed a method for <span class="italic">microwave assisted ultraviolet light digestion of biodiesel and subsequent analysis by sector field ICP-MS</span>. In this method a microwave with high pressure quartz vessels was used with ultraviolet radiation generated by a cadmium electrodeless discharge lamp working at 288 nm inside each quartz vessel. For the digestions, a sample size of 950 mg with 10 mL of 7 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> was optimum resulting in 4740 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of C in the final solutions. The reduction of the C content in the solutions to below 5000 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was important to reduce possible polyatomic interferences. This method was suitable for the simultaneous determination of Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and V. Low resolution was used for all elements except Cr which required medium resolution to resolve the ArC interference seen at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 52. Detection limits for this method were below 1 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for all elements except Cu, Mn and Ni which were 6.9, 4.8 and 2.8 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. This is an interesting method but somewhat expensive and time-consuming for commercial routine industrial analysis where simpler, quicker methods are available for these elements at these detection limits.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper utilizing sector field multi-collector ICP-MS was presented by Barela <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> This described a method for the <span class="italic">direct lead isotopic analysis of bioethanol using multi-collector ICP-MS with a total consumption sample introduction system</span>. In biodiesel samples, the determination of the total content of Pb is the normal analytical measurement made. However, isotopic analysis can give information on geographical provenance and type of raw material used for production. In this study isotopic reference materials for Pb (NIST SRM 981) and, to correct for mass bias, Tl (NIST SRM 997) were used. A high temperature torch integrated sample introduction system was also used, operating at 125 °C to minimise mass bias. The results showed a lighter Pb isotopic composition for the bioethanol samples than the NIST Pb standard but they are similar to those reported for wine and other alcoholic beverages coming from fermentation and distillation processes.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers describing methods for the analysis of biomass were of note. The first, by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> described combining <span class="italic">polarizing filtered planar laser induced fluorescence with simultaneous laser absorption, quantitative LIBS and two colour pyrometry to analyse a burning biomass pellet</span>. The K release during the combustion of biomass fuel pellets was investigated. The temporal release profiles of volatile atomic K and its compounds from a corn straw pellet showed a single peak, whereas woody biomass pellets produced a dual-maxima distribution. For both biomass types the highest concentrations of K occurred in the devolatilisation stage. The mass ratios between volatile atomic K and its compounds in corn straw and poplar were 0.77% and 0.79%, respectively. These values agree well with chemical equilibrium predictions that 0.68% of total K will be in atomic form. A two-step kinetic model of K release was developed which gave better predictions during the devolatilisation stage than the existing single-step model. Finally, a map of K transformation processes during combustion was developed.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The second biomass paper by Viljanen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> described <span class="italic">the real time release of Ca, K and Na during thermal conversion of biomass using quantitative microwave assisted LIBS</span>. A new burner which allowed linear calibration of LIBS measurement for release studies during thermal conversion was developed. Many of these fuels contain high concentrations of alkali metals and chlorine which are harmful for boiler structures and may cause operational problems. Therefore, detailed quantitative information on release behaviour is required. The analytical performance of conventional LIBS measurement was significantly improved by introducing microwave radiation to the laser-induced plasma. An enhancement of linearity and a 60-fold improvement of LOD were observed with microwave-assisted LIBS compared with conventional LIBS. The LOD of Ca, K and Na were 16 ppb, 19 ppb and 10 ppb, respectively. In-flame microwave radiation-LIBS measurement was then applied to record time-traces of K, Na and Ca during thermal conversion of a poplar pellet.</p>

        <h3 id="sect882"><span class="b_heading">2.3 Pharmaceuticals and personal care products</span></h3>
        <span>Spectrochemical elemental analysis has become <span class="italic">a requirement for pharmaceuticals and the raw materials used for their production.</span> This is to comply with regulations issued by the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH Q3D). There is a requirement to determine impurities to ever lower levels. A review containing 54 references of the research and development articles and scientific papers published since 2000 (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98">ref. 98</a>) focused on ICP-OES and ICP-MS analysis of pharmaceutical products. The review included aspects of sample preparation, potential interferences, different calibration approaches as well as their analytical performance and validation parameters. The coupled technique of LC-ICP-MS has become an extremely useful tool for elemental speciation. A review focusing on the analytical performance in organic matrices and the effect interfaces have on factors such as efficiency, resolution, sensitivity and extra-column solute dispersion was published recently.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> For this purpose, 55 published studies were evaluated. Interfaces in the form of the sample introduction systems (nebuliser and spray chamber) and a flow-splitter to reduce the organic solvent load are most common. However, their effect on peak broadening during the initial separation has often not been addressed. An excellent graphical representation was given, highlighting that extra-column variance introduced by the interface can significantly affect the separation by reducing the available number of plates and therefore the method’s performance in terms of resolution and sensitivity. A second review highlighted that ICP-MS has become a valuable detection method when coupled to separation techniques such as (U) HPLC.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> Coupling methods and quantifying approaches for the detection of, for example, Br, Cl, I, P, S and Se in non-metal drugs were reviewed (149 references). In addition, the authors stressed the need for derivatisation when an ICP-MS detectable hetero-element is missing. This can be achieved by derivatising –OH, –COOH, –SH or –NH<small><sub>2</sub></small> functional groups.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Sample preparation</span> remains a vital aspect of any analytical approach and recent publications have focused on its optimisation. An ultrasonic assisted micro-extraction of Cd and Pb in lipsticks and eye shadow utilising deep eutectic solvent was developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> This approach is more favourable compared with the use of other ionic liquid solvents as they are biodegradable, biocompatible as well as non-toxic. An extensive multivariate approach (Plackett–Burman design) enabled the authors to show that the main factors affecting the extraction were time, volume of deep eutectic solvent and pH. Both Cd and Pb were complexed with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Compared with other studies, the designed approach performed well, but LODs were amongst the higher ones reported. Results of multi-level spike studies further demonstrated excellent performance of this method with reported recoveries of 96.6–98.4% for Cd and 97.0–98.7% for Pb. Similarly, Koosha <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> developed a Cd extraction and preconcentration procedure following an extensive multivariate approach. Factors such as pH, concentration of complexing agent, volume of solvent, number of injections and time were assessed using a Plackett–Burman design. The optimisation of these factors was achieved following a Box–Behnken design and resulted in the following optimal parameters: complexing agent was 0.00155 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> 1-nitroso-2-naphthol, extraction solvent was 130 μL of octanol, an ionic strength of 2 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> NaCl and a pH of 6.5. A linear range of 2.5–650 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> 0.997) was achieved as well as a limit of detection of 0.68 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Excellent intra-day and inter-day precision of &lt;2% were demonstrated. Applying the developed procedure to water, pharmaceutical materials and a certified reference sample showed spike (<span class="italic">n</span> = 3) recoveries of 96.8–102.7%, highlighting the excellent accuracy and precision of the extraction. In addition, it was a highly specific approach as no interferences were observed for the 18 ions investigated.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Generally, sample preparation for traditional ICP-OES approaches is very labour intensive and can involve the use of strong acids such as HF, which is a serious safety concern and is often avoided by laboratories completely. Speranca <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit103"><sup><span class="sup_ref">103</span></sup></a> reported a method of sample preparation that involved <span class="italic">using polyvinyl alcohol to convert sunscreen sample into a solid</span>. The obtained thin sample disc was analysed using LIBS to determine the Ti concentration. The LIBS spectra obtained were normalised and standardised utilising instrumental software. Results obtained using a digestion followed by ICP-OES detection were in agreement with LIBS results when applying a multi linear regression multivariate calibration. However, no actual spike studies were performed. This would be beneficial in future studies to assess the method’s accuracy. Currently, a labour-intensive and time-consuming ICP-OES preparation is used as a reference method. However, the recovery of the digestion has not been investigated and is likely to be affected by the multistep process. This work reported a promising alternative with simplified sample preparation helping to avoid the use of strong acids.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A different sample preparation approach utilised a sequential co-precipitation scheme. This was based on Mg(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CaF<small><sub>2</sub></small> precipitation for detection of Cd in multivitamin/mineral supplements utilising an isotope dilution (ID) – ICP-MS method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit104"><sup><span class="sup_ref">104</span></sup></a> The authors aimed to remove matrix interference (Mo and spiked Sn) from the supplements. Best results were achieved following a three-step co-precipitation approach. Interfering Ca was first precipitated in the form of CaF<small><sub>2</sub></small> after the addition of hydrofluoric acid, which also resulted in significant Mo and Sn co-precipitating. Addition of triethylamine to the supernatant further reduced Mo and Sn levels. After further addition of triethylamine 99.7% of Mo and 96.5% of Sn were successfully removed from the sample solution. In addition, this approach also removed salts (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P and Zn) commonly found in the supplement matrix. This is beneficial as it helps to avoid matrix suppression effects as well as preventing salt build up in the ICP-MS components. Applying the developed procedure to CRMs showed excellent recoveries (ranging from 95.6 to 98.5%) for all three Cd isotopes assessed. In addition, it was demonstrated that 99.6 and 97.7% of Mo and Sn, respectively were removed from the supplement CRM. One drawback of this method is the safety concern arising from the use of HF. However, for experienced, well trained analysts this should not present any difficulties.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Ansar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit105"><sup><span class="sup_ref">105</span></sup></a> developed a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-ICP-MS/MS method for the detection of S (external and intra-liposomal) in doxorubicin HCL liposomal formulations, which are used in the treatment of leukaemia and various cancers. These liposomes encapsulate doxorubicin and promote targeted drug delivery as well as reducing negative side effects. The CE was utilised to separate external and intra-liposomal S which was achieved within 8 min. Traditional detection methods, such as UV/vis spectrometry and conductivity measurements rely on the disintegration of the liposomes in order to measure intracellular S. This step becomes obsolete with the developed ICP method as the plasma itself disintegrates the liposomes. Utilising a triple quadrupole ICP-MS instrument, the interfering oxygen dimer at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 32 can be avoided as the mass transition of <small><sup>32</sup></small>S<small><sup>+</sup></small> to <small><sup>32</sup></small>S<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> was achieved utilising O<small><sub>2</sub></small> as the reaction gas.

In contrast to a more traditional ICP based approach, the authors utilised total reflection XRF for the analysis. Results showed some individual components exceeding the regulatory limits for Cd and Cr. However, considering the dilution of these within the final product, the levels were judged to be acceptable. It was noted that no method validation data were available, which would be beneficial to illustrate the analytical performance of this method. In addition, it would have supported the method’s performance claims to compare results with those obtained using other analytical methods.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In common with last year’s review, <span class="italic">the manipulation and processing of large amounts of data</span> has been the focus of a number of studies. Some spectroscopy techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LIBS, are favourable because of their quasi-non-destructive nature and the speed of analysis. However, due to the large amount of data created, the interpretation requires time and expertise. A curve fitting regression model used in combination with WDXRF was utilised for the detection of Cd, Ni and Pb in seven pharmaceutical powders.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit108"><sup><span class="sup_ref">108</span></sup></a> The authors compared this methodology with results obtained by applying ordinary least squares regression and partial least square approaches. Performance in terms of correlation (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>) and root mean square error (RMSE), which represents the average distribution scatter, was assessed. In 86% of data sets, curve fitting regression produced statistically smaller RMSE compared with the other two methodologies when calculated on a validation data set. The overall absolute error achieved was 3–5 ppm, which does not meet the needs of pharmaceutical applications. Nonetheless, it is a promising WDXRF quantification method for less demanding applications. In addition, it could further enhance the performance of more efficient XRF systems such as total reflection XRF. It has been shown that analytical performance could be enhanced when using a multiple spectral line correction approach for the determination of Bi in different medicines utilising microwave induced plasma optical emission spectrometry (MIP-OES).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> By summing the intensities of multiple Bi lines (223.061 and 306.772 nm) for both calibration standards and samples, it was possible to improve the analytical performance. The LODs reported were ∼10 times lower compared with a more traditional direct analysis approach. In addition, the results were compared with a hydride generation method as well as a standard addition approach. Performance was comparable to that of hydride generation, without the need for time-consuming sample preparation. This is a promising technique for faster analysis with enhanced performance. However, it needs to be assessed for specific cases if lower specificity can be accepted for faster and more cost-effective analysis.</p>

          <span class="italic">The suitability of Machine learning has been evaluated in analytical chemistry</span>. In an effort to decrease sample preparation time, Parhizakar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> assessed the suitability of attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy in combination with partial least square – least square support vector machine modelling for the determination of Fe in ferrous syrups and drops. The spectra were baseline corrected (standard normal variate method). For this purpose, 158 samples were used to calibrate the model to then allow the analysis of 40 test specimens. In addition, Fe concentrations were obtained utilising AAS. This resulted in a multivariate model of spectral data obtained with both methods, allowing the prediction of Fe content utilising the developed model. The authors addressed the potential of over-training, which can be an issue for machine learning methods. Excellent correlation was observed for both calibration and cross-validation samples with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. Since pharmaceutical preparations need to abide by strict regulations, it remains questionable if machine learning methods can fulfil the required precision and accuracy of more traditional methods.

        <p class="otherpara">This approach to <span class="italic">counterfeit identification</span> has been investigated, for example, utilising EDXRF in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) and Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogies (SIMCA).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> The XRF spectra (scanning Na to U) were obtained for Plavix tablets, an anti-platelet medication. Reference samples were available from registered manufacturers or purchased in pharmacies. In order to account for normal variation two of the reference samples were generic samples containing the same active ingredient, but a different salt. Utilising the data obtained using EDXRF scans, PCA was able to visualise the similarities and differences between these reference samples and 10 suspected counterfeit samples. Both PCA on its own and when utilised with SIMCA enabled the authors to distinguish counterfeit samples from authentic samples allowing for fast screening of suspect samples. In addition, other analytical methods (HPLC) were applied to confirm the authenticity of one of the suspect samples. However, it was noted that the validated SIMCA model was no more capable of distinguishing samples than the simpler PCA. In fact, PCA was able to show clearer discrimination between the counterfeit samples compared with SIMCA.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect953"><span class="b_heading">2.4 Organic materials: cultural heritage applications</span></h3>
        <span>A <span class="italic">recent review assessing the work published over 20 years</span> and citing 125 references, focused on the use of portable and laboratory-based instruments for the analysis of mediaeval wall paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> The authors pointed out that the work published in more recent years has focused on identifying degradation processes in an effort to aid preservation and restoration. Multi-technique approaches have been proven to yield the most information. Techniques that have been utilised were, for example, XRF, UV/vis, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy as well as SEM-EDS, MS and GC-MS. When sample preservation was not crucial, LIBS has proven useful for elemental characterisation. It should be noted though that the damage inflicted using LIBS can be minimal. A second review (84 references)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> highlighted the increasing use of synchrotron X-ray nano-probes in cultural heritage studies. Utilising nano-X-ray fluorescence, nano-X-ray diffraction and nano-X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it is possible to obtain insights into elemental composition, crystalline structure and speciation, respectively. The challenges that remain are the focusing of the beam, the sample preparation as well as data acquisition, analysis and interpretation.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The potential of <span class="italic">X-ray luminescence for cultural heritage applications</span> has been investigated by analysing samples of various shapes and dimension.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> Initial tests with laboratory-based equipment showed results comparable to those obtained utilising cathodoluminescence and ion-beam-induced luminescence. This justified further optimisation with the aim of establishing a portable set up. For this purpose, a lead collimator, which narrows the X-rays from a tungsten anode to a spot, was utilised. The generated light was passed through a collecting lens and further transported to the spectrometer (250–630 nm) <span class="italic">via</span> an optical fibre. To avoid scatter X-rays, lead shielding was employed. In addition, a camera was utilised to evaluate the area under study. The collection lens was vital to obtain maximised signal and enable luminescence signals for a portable device which was based on a typical XRF set up. The developed device recorded luminescence spectra with an integration time of three minutes. This allowed the discrimination of lapis lazuli samples and aided provenance studies.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">hybrid system was developed for the analysis of heritage stones and model wall paintings</span> that utilised pulsed laser excitation Raman, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy signals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> For this purpose a nanosecond Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and a spectrograph were utilised. The spectrograph was coupled with a time-gated intensified charge coupled device which enabled detection with temporal resolution. Raman and LIF spectra were obtained simultaneously, whereas after a changeover of approximately 2 minutes LIBS could be used. It took about 10 minutes to change to different excitation wavelength utilised in this work (532, 355, and 266 nm). The Raman results enabled the differentiation of sulfate-based stones from those made of carbonate, whereas LIF provided information with regards to the nature of the organic residues. Moreover, the time-resolved LIF signals provided information of fluorescence origin, which can help to identify organic and inorganic emitters in both matrices studied. The combined results obtained for the model wall painting analysed by the hybrid system allowed identification of the pigment as red vermillion (HgS).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In common with other fields, <span class="italic">data manipulation and interpretation</span> remains a most vital step in the analysis of cultural heritage samples. Cheung<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> reported a three-step pre-processing scheme for plume laser induced fluorescence, a minimally destructive multi-element analysis technique the data from which may be used for chemometric sorting. It was possible to reduce the single-shot uncertainty from 54% down to only 6.5% by rejecting dim featureless parts of the spectra as outliers (dimmest 5–10% of captured spectra), as well as subtracting the baseline. Finally, taking advantage of the linearity of fluorescence, the spectral areas were normalised. The developed scheme was applied to pre-process red seal inks and Chinese black inks which were consequently sorted using PCA. Applying this methodology, clean sorting was achieved even when using single-shot spectra.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The development of a <span class="italic">reliable and fast classification of LIBS spectra based on various computational intelligence models</span> was reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> The aim was to simplify the current labour-intense process of LIBS data interpretation. Fifty ink samples were applied to 50 paper samples. Then LIBS spectra (185–904 nm) were collected utilising a Q-switched Quantel Ultra Nd:YAG laser working at a wavelength of 1064 nm and a 6 channel spectrometer equipped with a charge coupled device detector. Initial visual inspections after PCA allowed differentiation of the various papers used. However, the identification of inks proved to be more challenging. Hence, seven different computational intelligence algorithms, as well as pre-processing of the obtained spectra, were assessed for their ability to separate paper-ink samples. Best results were achieved utilising the random forest method achieving an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.1, 86.3 and 99.5%, respectively. The methodology could provide useful information for both cultural heritage and forensic applications from an identification point of view (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</p>

        <h3 id="sect1059"><span class="b_heading">2.5 Polymers and composites</span></h3>
        <span>There is no doubt that the most extensively researched analytical topic for polymers is <span class="italic">LIBS classification</span>. As well as numerous applications, a review article by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> has also been presented. The review, containing 82 references, covered the instruments that have been used for plastic analysis, methods of discrimination between different plastic types, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of plastics and other applications. Also discussed were the calibration protocols used (including calibration-free LIBS) and the chemometric algorithms used to help classification of different plastic types. The last section discussed the use of LIBS for the analysis of plastic toys, food containers and e-waste. The authors finished off by proposing potential future applications and areas of research.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition to the review discussed above, numerous <span class="italic">applications of the LIBS analysis of plastics</span> for sorting or classification purposes have also been described. Many of them have the same format, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the LIBS spectra of assorted plastics are used to train an algorithm and then the algorithm is used to identify the plastic type of ‘unknown’ samples. Included in this type of paper is one by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> that described differentiation between 11 plastic types. There were 20 samples of each plastic type and each sample was analysed at 10 different places to minimise any effects of laser pulse energy on the spectra produced. The spectra produced were interrogated using several algorithms including random forest, random forest with Variable Importance, Partial Least Squares Discrimination Analysis (PLSDA) and Partial Least Squares Discrimination Analysis with Variable Importance (PLSDAVI). A brief description of each was given to aid a new worker in the field. This included a helpful schematic diagram for the PLSDAVI. Of the 2200 spectra collected (11 × 20 × 10), 1980 were used for training the models and 220 were treated as unknowns. All of the algorithms had a high success rate of correct classification, with the variable importance versions being even more successful than those not using it. The most successful algorithm was VI followed by PLSDA which had a success rate of 99.55%. An added bonus was that it also had the shortest classification time (0.096 ms). Other good examples of this type of paper are two by the same research group.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128,129</span></sup></a> These papers used the C–N line at 388.3 nm and the atom lines of C (247.86 nm), H (656.3 nm) and O (777.3 nm) and the unsupervised learning algorithm <span class="italic">k</span>-means and cluster analysis to differentiate 20 industrial polymers. In the paper by Tang <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> self-organising maps (a type of artificial neural network) was also used. When self-organising maps alone was used, only 18 of the 20 plastics could be differentiated; with polycarbonate and polystyrene being problematic. When <span class="italic">k</span>-means was used as well, the success rate was 99.2%. It was also in excess of 99% in the paper by Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> Jull <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> used LIBS followed by <span class="italic">k</span>-nearest neighbour and Soft Independent Modelling by Class Analogy (SIMCA) to analyse several types of recyclable materials. These included brown, green and clear glass, aluminium, tin and the polymers polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene and the bioplastics Novatein and polylactic acid. Although the glass types could not be distinguished, the biopolymers could easily be separated from the other polymers. The <span class="italic">k</span>-nearest neighbour algorithm provided better classification than SIMCA. Similar results were obtained when the range of the LIBS spectra was decreased from 182.26–908.07 nm to 313.20–495.12 nm. Another example was by Roh <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> who used LIBS along with PCA and Independent Component Analysis, Fuzzy C-means, Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks Classifier to classify black plastics. Black plastics can be extra-problematic to classify because the usual technique of IR cannot be used. Again, a brief description was given of how each of the algorithms works. The black plastics polypropylene, polystyrene and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene were classified according to their resin type with a maximum success rate of 95.83%. A further paper, by Kim and Choi<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> used the C/H line intensity ratio, the presence of the C–C delocalised bonds, and any signal from a heteroatom to distinguish between the black plastics polypropylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, PET and polystyrene. The PET was easily identifiable because of the strong O peak at 777.2 nm, but the other plastics could also be identified through the other measurands. The final paper in this sub-section was presented by Dastjerdi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit133"><sup><span class="sup_ref">133</span></sup></a> who used LIBS combined with the Support Vector Machine model to separate polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from other polymers. Again, the basic principles of the algorithm were given along with schematic diagrams of the LIBS setup and the automated sorting system. Although not infallible, the method did manage a successful differentiation 90.5% of the time. The authors concluded that the combination of LIBS and Support Vector Machine had great potential for such a differentiation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Techniques other than LIBS have also been used to distinguish between different polymer types.</span> Two papers by Madiona <span class="italic">et al.</span> used TOF-SIMS followed by multivariate analysis techniques to distinguish between similar polyamide materials<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit134"><sup><span class="sup_ref">134</span></sup></a> and between PET, PTFE polymethyl methacrylate and low density polyethylene.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a> In recent years TOF-SIMS has advanced significantly with the most recent instruments having far greater capability and resolution compared with previous versions.

In the first example,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit134"><sup><span class="sup_ref">134</span></sup></a> self-organising maps and PCA were used to differentiate between seven polyamide samples (types of nylon). The PCA separated a few sample types, but failed to differentiate between all of them. However, following ‘up-binning’ (where more data is inserted through higher spectral resolution) both supervised and unsupervised training of the self-organising maps led to successful differentiation (98% and 99%, respectively).

This ‘up-binning’ enabled decreased user intervention, removal of bias and provided a larger dataset so that all features within a mass range can be taken into account. The authors concluded that their approach held a great deal of potential in the field of materials and biomaterials analysis.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several other applications of the analysis of polymers have been produced during this review period. This has included a <span class="italic">LA-ICP-MS and LA-ICP-OES method utilising a novel calibration approach</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> The paper, by Villasenor <span class="italic">et al.</span>, reported the determination of Al, As, Ca, Cr, Hg, Mg, Si, Ti and Zn in the polymers polyethylene and polypropylene. The calibration method was entitled ‘dried droplet calibration approach’ and involved a small volume (at the μL range) of an aqueous standard being placed on the polymer surface and then dried prior to LA sample introduction. The concentrations of the analytes in the samples were obtained by extrapolation of the calibration curves. The method reportedly overcame matrix effects that are a known problem for LA sample introduction because the sample and the added standard were ablated simultaneously and hence the generated aerosols reached the plasma at the same time. Accuracy of the method was demonstrated through the analysis of three CRMs. In general, good agreement between experimental results and the certified values was obtained. The exceptions were for elements that are very volatile, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> As and Hg or those that are present at very low concentration, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ti. These analytes showed significant deviation from the certified values.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Three papers have described the determination of <span class="italic">silicone materials</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">137–139</span></sup></a> In the first example, Vogel <span class="italic">et al.</span> coupled size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with ICP-OES to obtain speciation information of polydimethylsiloxanes in volatile and non-volatile solvents. The SEC enabled separation of silicones over the mass range 311–186<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 Da and the ICP-OES gave good sensitivity detection with LOD being below mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The average precision was 5.5% RSD. The second paper was presented by Ledesma <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit138"><sup><span class="sup_ref">138</span></sup></a> who reported the determination of silicone material contaminants on epoxy composites. The surface analysis techniques of XPS and LIBS were used with data from the two being compared with respect to their reliability. The advantages of LIBS over XPS in terms of speed, lack of necessity for sample preparation, real-time results and ease of use were all highlighted. The Si concentrations determined showed an excellent correlation between the two techniques. The paper by Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">139</span></sup></a> used LIBS to evaluate the tracking and erosion test performance of materials. The normal test, termed the inclined plane is very time-consuming and the LİBS test was significantly faster. Twenty seven materials were tested with either the aluminium hydroxide or the silica in the fillers being the target analytes. Thermogravimetry was also undertaken on the materials. Full experimental details of all three tests were given including a schematic diagram of the LIBS system. The LIBS spectra were complex and, although some Al lines, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> 308.2 nm, could clearly be identified, further assistance was required to obtain more information. The authors therefore used PCA and a neural network algorithm. The PCA could distinguish between several of the sample types but not all. The neural Networks algorithm used after the PCA enabled distinction between the rest.</p>

          <span class="italic">Laser ablation</span> along with other techniques has been used for polymer analysis. Bezemer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">140</span></sup></a> used LA-ICP-MS, XRF and IRMS to obtain analytical data from the plastic caps of flash bangers and then used PCA on the data to classify them. A total of 202 samples were tested by LA-ICP-MS and 53 elements screened for. For blue caps, only 13 analytes were present in all samples and a further 26 analytes were present in at least one sample. The white caps had fewer elements and those that were present were at lower concentration. Only 89 samples were analysed using XRF. Since it has far lower sensitivity, it was less useful. However, it did analyse the whole of the cap rather than a small spot and therefore did not suffer potential inhomogeneity problems experienced by LA-ICP-MS. For those analytes that could be detected using both techniques (Ca, Cr, Cu, Mg, S and Si) correlation between the two was very good. The XRF analysis of post-explosion caps was not straightforward because the samples were no longer flat and were also contaminated by residues of the explosive powder. The PCA analysis of the LA-ICP-MS data identified seven classes of blue cap and three classes of white cap. Isotope ratio measurements of C and H gave further discrimination. It was concluded that the protocol could easily be applied to forensic samples. Another example of LA-ICP-MS this time in tandem with LİBS was presented by Bonta and Limbeck.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141</span></sup></a> Under normal circumstances, both techniques suffer matrix effects and often require matrix matched standards for calibration. The techniques used in tandem, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> data obtained using both instruments from one laser shot, actually overcomes these problems. A full description of the system was supplied including the sample preparation procedure which involved the samples being spin coated as a layer on a high purity silicon wafer. The LIBS was capable of determining alkali and alkaline earth elements and LA-ICP-MS was used to determine other elements at the μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range. Analytical data from the combined techniques were input to PCA. The protocol was applied to three plastic types (polymethyl methacrylate, polyimide and polyvinylpyrrolidine) totalling 23 samples. The PCA could easily differentiate between the three polymer types. Future work would involve the analysis of more polymer types and to investigate the possibility of depth-profile measurements.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers have claimed <span class="italic">novel instrumentation</span> for the analysis of polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142,143</span></sup></a> The paper by Pardede <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> utilised a novel double pulse LİBS system to determine Cl, F and H in PTFE and PVC. Normally, halogens show very poor sensitivity during LİBS analysis. However, using two lasers firing at an aluminium target in a helium atmosphere produced a helium plasma that was capable of exciting the analytes in the samples. One of the lasers was a nanosecond Nd:YAG operating at 54 mJ and the other a picosecond Nd:YAG laser operating at 2 mJ. Both lasers operated at their fundamental wavelength. Full details of the setup were provided. The system was also applied to the determination of H and D in a zircaloy sample. The authors proposed a mechanism by which the excitation occurred. The other proof of principle paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> described the use of a compact near edge X-ray fine structure (NEXAFS) microscope to form an elemental map on a 30 × 30 μm<small><sup>2</sup></small> piece of PET. The paper described in detail the source, the system, the spectral measurements and the results, with a useful schematic diagram of the instrument also being provided. Briefly, in the proposed system spatially localised spectra are taken using a broad band soft X-ray source and the overall image is obtained by rastor scanning. Using conventional synchrotron sources, the image is obtained from a series of full field images taken at different energies.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several more <span class="italic">straightforward applications</span> have been published.

The analysis is necessary because excess I can lead to corrosion of the electronic components in the automotive industry. Sample (0.200 g) was cut into small pieces and placed in a microwave bomb. Nitric acid (5 mL) was added and the bomb heated using microwave irradiation to 150 °C and maintained at that temperature for 30 min. After cooling, the digests were transferred to polypropylene flasks and diluted to 50 mL using ultrapure water. The acid digest could then be analysed using ICP-OES for the Cu and K content. The I was determined using ICP-MS following dilution of 1 mL of the acid digest with 24 mL of 0.5% ammonia solution (to decrease memory effects). Unfortunately, no CRM was used to validate the method. However, a spike of 50 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> I yielded a recovery of 100 ± 0.8%. The LOD was calculated to be 150 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for ICP-MS correlating to 0.9 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the solid material. A microwave assisted alkaline extraction using ammonia or TMAH yielded results approximately 10% lower than the acid extraction. Analysis of the plastics yielded I concentrations from below LOD to 1000 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with a precision of between 2.2 and 4.5% RSD.

The sample powder had to be mixed with ammonium chloride volatilisation aid for complete recovery of Cr. Method validation was achieved through the analysis of the CRM EC 680K – low density polyethylene. Analytical data obtained were in good agreement with certified values (better than 94% and with a <span class="italic">t</span>-test indicating that there was no significant difference).

Unfortunately, the most prominent lines occurred in the UV region and were interfered with by Fe, Si and Ti. Weaker ionic lines occurred in the visible region. Despite there being a weak Fe interference, the Sb wavelength at 276.99 nm was used for all measurements. The authors provided details of how the Fe signal was subtracted from the total signal yielding a reliable Sb measurement. Samples including luggage tags, light bulb fittings, Christmas decorations and numerous others were analysed giving Sb concentrations between the LOD (approximately 1400 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) up to over 65<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

The team used statistical analysis of the measured interferences to determine a set of guidelines for selecting the appropriate analytical lines depending on the matrix complexity. A rapid LIBS method as an alternative to chemical digestion followed by ICP-OES procedures for the determination of PGMs in supported catalysts was reported by Jaine and Mucalo.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> A series of bespoke reference materials was produced by evaporation of known volumes of liquid stock solutions in a Pyrex beaker, followed by reconstitution in neat ethanol containing 50 mg of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and 2.97 g of silica or alumina support material. The solutions were evaporated again to produce supported metal nanoparticles. The production was confirmed using TEM. Reference concentrations were determined using NAA and they were then used to produce a PLS model for calibration of the LIBS system following pelletisation of the powered materials. The entire work flow for sample analysis required less than 10 min and concentrations were predicted with as little as 0.1 wt% error.

          <span>Ceramics are, by nature, difficult to dissolve and are very resistant to heat. Their analysis can therefore be problematic. Most methods therefore rely on the direct analysis of the solid materials. Consequently, analytical techniques such as LA-ICP-MS, LIBS, XRF or glow discharge methods are commonly reported.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">LIBS analysis of aluminium oxide powder materials</span> has been reported in two papers.

Two approaches to building a univariate simple linear regression curve were taken. One correlated the known concentration of an analyte in a standard to the normalised value of an integrated emission line to give a response signal. The integrated area of a nearby background region was used to normalise the data. The second approach used the intensity at one of two Al wavelengths to normalise the data. Both methods were described in the paper. Linearity extended from 0.086 to 12.4 weight%. The LOD for the analytes depended on which wavelengths were used, but ranged from 0.001 to 0.108% for Eu and from 0.001 to 0.183% for Sm, respectively. The second paper, by Pandey <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit190"><sup><span class="sup_ref">190</span></sup></a> described the determination of Ni impurities in alumina powders of different particle size. Three materials were used for the analysis, the first had a particle size of 190 ± 64 nm, the second of 500 ± 160 nm, but was prone to agglomeration forming particles with an average hydrodynamic size of 1.7 μm (although this varied between tens of nm to hundreds of μm). The third material had an average particle size of 35 ± 13 μm. Samples were doped with a Ni solution to varying concentrations, dried and then pressed into pellets of known density. Sensitivity of the LIBS analyses increased as the grain size increased for a given density. It was concluded that both the particle size and the density of the pellet should be specified when preparing calibration curves.</p>

The materials were then spin coated on quartz disks and the samples analysed for Cr, Fe and Mn using TXRF. A poor correlation was observed between fluorescence intensity and standard concentration which was not improved through the use of an internal standard. This was attributed to the internal standard being in a different part of the spin coating rather than in the ceramic powder. It therefore did not correct for matrix effects.

          <span>One of the more common themes of analysis in this review period has been the <span class="italic">elucidation of corrosion mechanisms</span>. Two papers by Rodrigues <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the use of SIMS<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit210"><sup><span class="sup_ref">210</span></sup></a> and TOF-SIMS<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> to examine surface alteration of glasses under museum-like environments. Other techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> μ-Raman and FTIR were also used in both studies. In the first paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit210"><sup><span class="sup_ref">210</span></sup></a> the effect of room temperature and relative humidity on degradation of replicas of three soda-rich glass types were studied. The thickness of the altered layer was proportional to the exposure time and to the relative humidity of the atmosphere. Data indicated that Na was leached from lower level in the glass leading to deficient areas whereas the surface became enriched. In the second paper, the secondary ions determined included Al, As, Ca, Fe, H, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Si and some molecular species. Results demonstrated that Ca and Pb played dominant roles in the hydration and hydrolysis of the glass surfaces. Again, different conditions likely to be found in a museum environment were tested. A third paper to discuss corrosion of glass was presented by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit212"><sup><span class="sup_ref">212</span></sup></a> These authors used TOF-SIMS to monitor the H/Na interface on a corroded International Simple Glass. The H/Na interface could be imaged directly using positive ion imaging without any auxiliary sputtering beam under high vacuum (2 × 10<small><sup>−8</sup></small> mbar). The H background was approximately 5% in the pristine glass, rising to 15% in the alteration layer.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">forensic analysis of glass</span> has also been a topic of interest. In common with the analysis of other forensic sample types, minimally destructive analytical approaches are adopted. Seyfang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> discussed the TOF-SIMS, sensitive high resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) and SEM-EDS analysis of glass frictionators in 0.22 calibre rimfire ammunition. Such materials have replaced the antimony sulfide frictionator in a lot of ammunition. The composition of the glass particles does not change after use. In this study, 37 samples from 25 different manufacturers in 11 countries were analysed along with five standard reference glasses. For the TOF-SIMS analysis, the signals from 52 analyte ions were ratioed against the <small><sup>28</sup></small>Si<small><sup>+</sup></small> signal and the resulting data input to PCA. The SHRIMP analysis determined <small><sup>6</sup></small>Li<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>7</sup></small>Li<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>204</sup></small>Pb<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>206</sup></small>Pb<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>207</sup></small>Pb<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>232</sup></small>Th<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>238</sup></small>U<small><sup>+</sup></small>. The major isotopes of Be, Li, Mg, O and Si were also detected. Using TOF-SIMS data alone, 94.1% of the sample brands could be discriminated using a pairwise comparison. The SEM-EDS was capable of discriminating only 79.4% of the samples. When SHRIMP analysis was combined with the other techniques, successful discrimination was achieved for 95.6% of brands.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several other applications of the analysis of glass were presented. Two of them discussed <span class="italic">the use of LIBS</span>. Skruibis <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> used multiple pulses from a femtosecond Yb:potassium gadolinium tungstate laser (Yb:KGW) to improve the analytical performance of LIBS. The laser operated at an average power of 5 W and at 60 kHz, producing a wavelength of 1030 nm and a pulse width of 280 fs. The effect of a water film of thickness 0.8 mm on the LIBS analysis of glass was determined. The single pulse LIBS signal diminished significantly in the presence of water. This was attributed to quenching. The signal from multiple pulse LIBS was less affected, being both stronger and having longer duration. It has recently been found that the presence of nanoparticles enhances the LIBS sensitivity. Sanchez-Ake <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit215"><sup><span class="sup_ref">215</span></sup></a> used gold nanoparticles deposited on the sample and produced from a gold thin film coated on the sample to enhance the sensitivity of the LIBS analysis of glass. The thickness of the film, the laser fluence and the number of laser pulses were all studied. The nanoparticles produced from the thin film gave a lower signal to noise ratio than the pre-formed nanoparticles. The mechanism of enhanced sensitivity was hypothesised as being improved heat transfer from the particles to the glass surface. This enabled lower laser fluence to be used.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The final paper of interest to industrial glass analysts was presented by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a> who <span class="italic">devised a solution-based calibration method for LA-ICP-MS</span> analysis. The system employed a desolvating nebuliser system that was connected to the instrument <span class="italic">via</span> a Y piece between the LA cell and the spectrometer. The desolvating nebuliser system employed a semi-permeable membrane drier tube with a counter flow of argon to sweep the moisture away. Internal standards corrected for the differences in aerosol transport efficiencies between the nebuliser and the LA system. The method was validated through the analysis of several glass CRMs (NIST 610 – NIST 616) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene reference materials (GBW 08407 – 08411). Results were in good agreement with certified values. Detection limits for REE and other elements such as Cd, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were at the ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range. The results obtained from the analysis of biological materials were compared with those obtained using solution-based nebulisation and were also in good agreement.</p>

        <span>Accurate measurement of isotopic ratios in materials for nuclear safeguards and forensics is a popular subject area, most commonly through the measurement of actinide elements using ICP-MS or TIMS. The absence of reference materials or limited application of those reference materials that are available is also mentioned or addressed in several studies. The measurement of nuclear materials to improve understanding of fallout from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident is addressed in several studies. Similarly, the monitoring of material properties in operating reactors to minimise the risk of accidents occurring also features in numerous studies. As the sensitivity and interference removal capability of multiple techniques continue to improve, decommissioning radionuclides that are more challenging to measure (such as <small><sup>93</sup></small>Zr and <small><sup>129</sup></small>I) are now considered to be routinely measurable, with ICP-MS and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) commonly used, as well as TIMS, SIMS, XRF and LIBS. For the testing of material properties for nuclear fusion, LIBS remains the dominant measurement technique. Across all nuclear material applications, a common theme is minimising the procedural time, either through direct, non-destructive analysis, or rapid online radiochemical separation prior to measurement.</span>

          <span>Accurate measurement of <span class="italic">isotopic ratios in nuclear materials</span> is a key area for identifying the source of contamination following a radiological incident and for locating the source of illegally acquired nuclear material. The capabilities developed can also be applied to numerous other fields including geological dating and historical climate change studies. The measurement of actinide isotope ratios is the most common, in particular U and Pu using ICP-MS or TIMS.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Quemet <span class="italic">et al.</span> compared two approaches for minor U isotope ratio measurements using TIMS, which was conducted within a framework developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency for nuclear material round robin exercises.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit228"><sup><span class="sup_ref">228</span></sup></a> The total evaporation method was compared with the classical method with multi-dynamic sequences with respect to accuracy, analysable quantity, analysis time and versatility. Applying a mathematical correction of the abundance sensitivity and the detector calibration reduced the uncertainty and bias of the classical method compared with the total evaporation method. The same author used the total evaporation TIMS method for measurement of Am isotopic ratios as part of a round-robin exercise organised by the Analytical Methods Committee of the French Atomic Energy Commission.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> For the <small><sup>241</sup></small>Am<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/><small><sup>243</sup></small>Am isotopic ratio and Am concentration, biases below 0.0001% and 0.02%, and estimated expanded uncertainties of 0.1% and 0.8% were calculated, respectively.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Improving the sample loading procedure for TIMS</span> was the focus of some studies. Baruzzini <span class="italic">et al.</span> used Pt and Re porous ion emitter sources to investigate isotopic fractionation in U and Pu reference standards.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit230"><sup><span class="sup_ref">230</span></sup></a> A comparison of the correction of fractionation using the linear, the Power and the Russell’s laws was a further focus of the study. The porous ion emitter sources were successful, with Pu and U isotopic ratio values agreeing with those on the certificate. For both elements, the Power law was the most suitable for the experimental setup used, although all laws produced results that were statistically identical to the certificates. In a separate study, Mannion <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit231"><sup><span class="sup_ref">231</span></sup></a> used a polymer thin film for ultra-trace measurements of Pu. The aim was to simplify the single filament sample preparation method and to eliminate sample losses associated with the resin bead loading method whilst maintaining sensitivity and accuracy. Rhenium filaments were coated with a toroidal, hydrophilic anion-exchange polymer spot surrounded by a hydrophobic base polymer, which were loaded with 10 pg of New Brunswick Laboratory Certified Reference Material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> The use of dimpled filaments improved sample loading of drop deposits, and the polymer coating improved the shelf-life of the filaments, enabling bulk production.

            <span class="italic">Actinide isotope ratio detection</span> using MC-ICP-MS remains a popular topic. Ronzani <span class="italic">et al.</span> measured multiple U isotopes in various particles using MC-ICP-MS coupled with laser ablation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit232"><sup><span class="sup_ref">232</span></sup></a> The laser aerosol and water vapour were simultaneously injected using a desolvating nebuliser and mass bias, gain factors, polyatomic and tailing interferences were all corrected.

This unexpected variation provided information not previously known on the production process of the materials, and showed the technique developed would be valuable for forensic investigation of unknown nuclear material.

Subsequent SEM measurement of ablated material revealed that only 5 ng of material was used per measurement. Therefore, LA-ICP-MS can be considered a quasi-non-destructive technique, and the material can be further analysed by other techniques. In a separate study, Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span> dissolved U particles prior to MC-ICP-MS measurement of isotopic ratios.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit235"><sup><span class="sup_ref">235</span></sup></a> The relative expanded uncertainty in the reference materials measured ranged from 3.5% (<span class="italic">k</span> = 2) for <small><sup>234</sup></small>U:<small><sup>235</sup></small>U to 15% for <small><sup>230</sup></small>Th:<small><sup>234</sup></small>U.</p>

The inclusion of hyperfine structure and Stark broadening into the algorithm as fitting parameters was investigated, but was found to cause overfitting, negatively impacting the analytical accuracies.

          <span>Nuclear decommissioning requires measurement of a range of sample matrices containing various radionuclides and activity levels. As measurement techniques have improved, the number of radionuclides measurable has increased, contributing to the global need for safe and cost-effective decommissioning. A number of papers have demonstrated the high throughput and increased number of radionuclides measurable using mass spectrometric techniques, often combined with rapid online sample preparation techniques. Other studies have recognised that, equally important to accurate waste characterisation, is the long-term monitoring of radionuclides in waste storage and disposal facilities and the environment surrounding them.</span>

        <span>There have been <span class="italic">three reviews published</span> that are pertinent to thıs section. The first, by Noll <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> was an overview of LIBS for industrial applications which covered the developments from 2014 to 2018. This was reviewed in more detail in other sections, including Section 1, metals. It will not, therefore, be discussed further here. The other review, by Costa <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit292"><sup><span class="sup_ref">292</span></sup></a> reviewed (with 84 references) the use of LIBS for the chemical analysis of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). The review was split into convenient sections starting with an introduction containing bar charts demonstrating the rapid increase in use of LIBS over the last 20 years. This was followed by sections on data handling, approaches for qualitative and quantitative analysis, the identification of polymers in WEEE and the analysis of printed circuit boards. It finished off with some potential areas of future research. Many of the applications discussed were also presented in easy to access tables. The third review was presented by Gamez and Finch<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit293"><sup><span class="sup_ref">293</span></sup></a> who gave an overview of recent advances in surface elemental mapping using the glow discharge techniques GD-OES and GD-MS. The review, which contained 49 references, discussed instrumental advances, applications and 3D elemental surface mapping. The advantages of glow discharge, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the speed at which it can map a surface compared with other techniques, were also discussed. Among the instrumental advances described are changes to the discharge chamber design so that larger samples can be analysed and the use of different spectrometers, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> monochromators, acousto-optic tunable filters and push-broom hyperspectral imagers.</span>

          <span>
            <span class="italic">Measuring the thickness of thin films or layered samples</span> is very important. However, results can be variable. A paper by Sakurai and Kurokawa<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit294"><sup><span class="sup_ref">294</span></sup></a> reported the results of a round robin study for layer thickness determination using reference-free XRF. Two samples were obtained both containing layers of gold, nickel and copper. A total of 11 companies participated in the study producing 15 datasets. A variety of instrumentation (WDXRF and EDXRF) utilising assorted X-ray tubes (Ag, Mo, Pd, Rh and W) was used in the study and the participants were allowed to use whatever operating condition they wanted. Data were collected and a couple of outliers identified using Grubb’s test. A comparison of XRF data with those obtained using ICP-OES, ICP-MS or ID-ICP-MS following dissolution of the individual layers was made. Results were in good agreement. The overall precision of the XRF data were 4.3–6.6%.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by van der Heide<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit295"><sup><span class="sup_ref">295</span></sup></a> emphasised the critical need for <span class="italic">SIMS depth-profiling during the fabrication of complementary metal oxide semiconductors</span> (CMOS). The high sensitivity, low LOD and acceptably rapid throughput make it the technique of choice for this application. The paper has no research <span class="italic">per se</span>, but it provides a good overview of the capabilities of SIMS and discusses the future applications, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> analysis of three dimensional structures. Topics covered include the existing SIMS depth-profiling approaches for 2D and 3D structures, in-fabrication SIMS deployment, data analysis tools for the in-fabrication SIMS derived depth profiles that use pattern recognition and hybrid characterisation approaches. The authors suggested that a hybrid of XRD and SIMS could potentially be viable.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The need for <span class="italic">reference materials</span> is as relevant to these sample types as any other, but thus far, there is a distinct paucity. Honicke <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit296"><sup><span class="sup_ref">296</span></sup></a> have reported the development of thin layer reference materials that have a total mass deposition at the ng level for analytes such as Ca, Cu, Fe, La, Mo, Ni, Pb and Pd. Two samples were prepared by physical vapour deposition on silicon nitride membranes. One sample had 10-times lower deposition than the other. Other materials were prepared that had single element films and others were prepared on silicon wafers. Samples were characterised using a multitude of techniques including three different synchrotron radiation beamlines at the BESSY II electron storage ring employing a reference-free XRF approach. Homogeneity of the samples was tested at the PO4 beamline at DESY. Good precision was obtained during the measurements, indicating good precision during manufacture.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">analysis of wafers or silicon substrates</span> has been the focus of several papers because contamination of the wafers can have a huge effect on the quality and quantity of the end product. Mejstrik <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297</span></sup></a> discussed the re-installation of a TXRF instrument for silicon wafer surface analysis. A thorough description of the spectrometer as well as the robotic wafer manipulator was given. The authors prepared and validated a reference wafer with a known concentration of Ni contaminant. This was to be analysed after a set amount of time or after a set number of measurements. The wafer was then used as a reference for the analysis of some certified wafers. However, agreement with certified values was poor. The authors then used NIST 1640 spiked on to blank wafers as a second external check. Results for the Ni as well as Co, Cr, K and Mn were in good agreement with certified values, although the Cu, Fe and Zn data were in less good agreement. The authors concluded that the original certified wafers must have been contaminated during storage. A comparison of data obtained using the techniques of TXRF, TOF-SIMS, Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy and techniques used for the measurement of carrier lifetime was presented by Polignano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> Various experiments were undertaken aiming to mimic assorted processes, including wet processes, ion implantation, surface contamination <span class="italic">etc.</span> Correlation between TXRF and TOF-SIMS data was pretty good with the TOF-SIMS being better at determining the light elements than the TXRF. The relative advantages and disadvantages of each of the techniques were discussed. It was concluded that no one technique was capable of measuring the surface contaminants and the diffusivity. Two papers have discussed the determination of O in silicon. One reported the use of SIMS<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> and the other the use of LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a> In the paper by Jakiela,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> several modifications to the instrument were required. A very high primary flux of Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> (14.5 keV at an intensity of ∼300 nA) was used, the turbomolecular vacuum pump was replaced with an ion pump, a titanium sublimation pump was also used to improve vacuum further (to 2 × 10<small><sup>−10</sup></small> Torr when the ion beam was on) and the cryo-shield surrounding the sample chamber was cooled using liquid nitrogen. Once everything had been optimised, the LOD for O was 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> atoms cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. This was, according to the authors, at least 10 times lower than that reported in any other application. Further studies elucidated oxygen indiffusion and outdiffusion during annealing in Ar and in vacuum. It was noted that the results are qualitatively and quantitatively different for float zone silicon compared with Czochralski-grown silicon. The paper by Davari<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a> described the LIBS analysis and experimental setup in detail. Two LIBS protocols were compared. One simply used the intensity at the O wavelength at 777.19 nm. This, however, yielded both poor calibration (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.44) and sensitivity. The other method used both the 777.12 nm O line and a Si line at 781 nm. This internal standardisation procedure improved linearity of calibration significantly (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.95) and led to less error. By using the Si internal standardisation, fluctuations in plasma excitation temperatures could also be accounted for. Under optimal conditions, the LOD was 8 ppm O, which was lower than that obtainable using a Standard FTIR method.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Grazing incidence XRF</span> (GIXRF) has been reported for the analysis of thin films by three groups of workers. In one, Maderitsch <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit301"><sup><span class="sup_ref">301</span></sup></a> used it to analyse organic light emitting diodes. Samples were prepared such that a buffer layer was deposited on a substrate and then a hole transport layer followed by a host layer were deposited on that. Samples were analysed using a combination of the two non-destructive techniques of GIXRF and X-ray reflectometry (XRR), with the diffraction instrument having an additional fluorescence detector added. An added advantage of the two techniques is that they require virtually no sample preparation. The angle curves produced from the two techniques were processed using the software package called JGIXA. The S distribution in the layers was dependent on the sample preparation method of the host layer. In addition to determining the distribution of S, the combined GIXRF/XRR approach provided information such as layer thickness as well as surface and interface roughness. A second paper to combine GIXRF and XRR analysis was presented by Pessoa <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit302"><sup><span class="sup_ref">302</span></sup></a> who used the techniques to analyse telluride-based films that are often used for data storage devices and photovoltaic cells. The performance of both lab-based and synchrotron-based instrumentation was assessed for the characterisation of ultra-thin (&lt;10 nm) titanium-tellurium films that had been prepared by physical vapour deposition and then capped with a 5 nm Ta passivation layer. Both setups were sufficiently sensitive to provide accurate chemical depth profiles, with data compared with those obtained using TOF-SIMS, XPS and plasma profiling TOF-MS. Inter-diffusion between the tellurium and tantalum cap was observed by all techniques. The third paper was presented by Yamada <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit303"><sup><span class="sup_ref">303</span></sup></a> who studied the alloying of gold-copper layers using an assortment of techniques including GIXRF, XRR, XRD and conventional XRF. The GIXRF was undertaken using a benchtop total reflection WDXRF instrument. The samples were prepared and then some were heat treated at 300 °C for one hour. The angle-dependent GIXRF profiles were very different between heated and non-heated samples. Theoretical calculations indicated that alloying was occurring, even though the temperature was so low. The other non-destructive techniques confirmed the data found using GIXRF.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Hermann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit304"><sup><span class="sup_ref">304</span></sup></a> used <span class="italic">calibration-free LIBS to analyse nickel – chromium – molybdenum thin films</span> with thickness of 150 nm that had been prepared using pulsed laser deposition. The experimental setup was described in detail and the operating conditions used assumed to produce a plasma in local thermal equilibrium. These conditions were an atmospheric pressure of argon with an ultraviolet laser pulse of ns duration. Optimisation of the delay time between laser pulse and the detector gate identified times of 1 or 2 μs to be optimal. The data produced by the system were input to a simple algorithm enabling concentrations to be calculated. The data obtained were supported by data obtained using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The analytical performance of the LIBS technique was superior to either of the other techniques used.</p>

          <span>The analysis of solar cells or <span class="italic">the copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin films in solar cells</span> is still receiving attention from some researchers. Two papers have used LIBS for such an analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit306"><sup><span class="sup_ref">306,307</span></sup></a> In the first example, Choi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit306"><sup><span class="sup_ref">306</span></sup></a> determined the effects of varying the laser spot size between 35 and 150 μm on the LIBS data produced. If the spectral lines are chosen correctly, then the signal intensity ratio rather than intensity alone should be used because it is nearly independent of laser spot size. Using the concentration ratio method the CIGS layer composition could be determined accurately, differing only 5% from data obtained using ICP-OES. The other paper to use LIBS for CIGS analysis was presented by Xiu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit307"><sup><span class="sup_ref">307</span></sup></a> who optimised the operating parameters of the LIBS analysis and then provided both qualitative and quantitative data rapidly.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">LA-ICP-MS method of analysing silicon solar cells</span> for contaminants such as Ag, Cu and Ni arising from plated metal contacts was reported by Colwell <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit308"><sup><span class="sup_ref">308</span></sup></a> Once prepared, the cells were heat-treated to 200 °C for up to 1000 hours prior to the analysis. The surface contamination was removed through a wet etching process involving mixtures of nitric and hydrochloric/hydrofluoric acids before LA-ICP-MS identified the analytes that had penetrated the silicon wafer. No suitable silicon reference material was available, so NIST 614 glass was used as a non-matrix-matched standard for calibration. A study of the laser operating conditions was undertaken which demonstrated that high energy laser pulses doubled crater depth and led to a build up of re-solidified Si around the crater. This, in turn, decreased analysis speed and led to a decrease in transport efficiency to the plasma. Another problem observed was a very high uncertainty (∼50%). This was hypothesised to arise through non-uniformity in cell preparation as well as the line-scanning method used for LA-ICP-MS analysis.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Jang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit309"><sup><span class="sup_ref">309</span></sup></a> reported the <span class="italic">quantitative analysis and band gap determination of CIGS</span> absorber layers using a variety of instrumental techniques (XRF, LA-ICP-MS and ICP-OES). The bulk composition of the samples was determined using XRF and, after an acid digestion, ICP-OES. A fundamental parameters calibration approach was used to obtain the concentration ratios for XRF. Data obtained using femtosecond LA-ICP-MS were compared with those obtained using XRF. Elemental depth profiles were also obtained using SIMS and XPS. The band gap energy was calculated using a simple ratio method, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> Ga/(In + Ga).</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The setup, operation and application of a <span class="italic">laser induced ablation quadrupole mass spectrometer for the depth resolved-analysis</span> of thin film solar cells and of hydrogenated/deuterated thin films deposited on glass was reported by Oelmann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit310"><sup><span class="sup_ref">310</span></sup></a> After the introduction the authors described the setup in detail, giving schematic diagrams of the instrument. The idea of the instrument is that a picosecond laser operating at 355 nm ablates the sample and then the volatile gaseous products are analysed using the mass spectrometer. As with most laser-based depth-profile analyses, the same spot has to be sampled on numerous occasions. The spot was examined using surface profilometry and a confocal microscope to gauge depth per laser shot. The linear relation between the signal and the gas pressure within the ablation chamber simplified its calibration and reduced the uncertainties compared with other techniques. Very high vacuum was required to obtain sensitivity below the percent level. However, no sample preparation was required and the method is flexible with respect to the ablation rate. The picosecond laser pulse ensures that the thermal penetration depth is similar to the ablation rate, enabling a depth resolution of approximately 100 nm to be achieved. Data were compared with those obtained using LIBS, with good agreement being achieved.</p>

          <span>Numerous papers have been published that describe the analysis of <span class="italic">lithium ion batteries or their components</span>. The large majority use atomic spectrometry only as a peripheral or supportive tool and therefore do not bring any novelty to the field of atomic spectrometry. These papers will therefore not be discussed in this review. Several papers have discussed the use of LIBS for 3D mapping of the electrodes within the batteries. These have included two papers by Imashuku <span class="italic">et al.</span> who analysed the anode<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit311"><sup><span class="sup_ref">311</span></sup></a> and the cathode materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> Both papers monitored the Li signal at 610.4 nm under a reduced argon atmosphere of 1000 Pa. In the first example, the graphite anode of a battery was analysed until a depth of 150 μm had been reached, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the LIBS laser sampled from the same spot effectively drilling through the sample. Areas of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Li content were observed after the charge and discharge processes. The areas of inhomogeneous Li distribution after the charge process were attributed to a preferentially reacted area in the anode. The inhomogeneous areas found after the charge–discharge process were thought to be attributable to the low desolvation reaction rate of the Li ions at the solid electrolyte interphase. The inhomogeneous Li distributions were consistent with the charge–discharge curves and the Li ion transfer mechanism. The second paper studied the Li distribution in the LiCoO<small><sub>2</sub></small> cathode material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> A calibration curve was constructed comprising varying amounts of lithium carbonate in cobalt oxide (Co<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>) giving ratios of Li to Co of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.51, 0.62, 0.80 and 0.99. The distribution of Li in the cycled material as determined using LIBS was in close agreement with the data obtained using XAS, but the precision was less good. The conclusion of both papers was that LIBS was capable of semi-quantitative determination of Li distribution in the electrodes, but was far simpler to apply than XAS.

Three configurations were prepared: alternating pattern (30 electrolyte droplets, 30 standard droplets), centered pattern (28 electrolyte droplets, 13 standard droplets) and octagonal (24 electrolyte droplets and nine Standard droplets). Validation was achieved through an acid digestion followed by ICP-OES analysis. Recovery rates for the TXRF analyses were between 98 and 105%, which compared favourably to the 85–90% achieved using a conventional application procedure. The centered pattern gave the best results in terms of recovery and precision. However, there were some problems noted with the technique. This included the Co being below the LOD and the Ni concentration detected being three times that of Mn – even though they were known to be in the electrolyte at the same concentration. The paper by Harte <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit314"><sup><span class="sup_ref">314</span></sup></a> described the optimisation of a LA-ICP-MS method in terms of speed and frequencies and determined the effect on the spatial resolution of the mapping experiments.

          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have discussed the <span class="italic">analysis of mobile phone components</span>. A paper by Bookhagen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit316"><sup><span class="sup_ref">316</span></sup></a> discussed how 34 mobile phones from different manufacturers were disassembled and then the components acid digested using a microwave digestion system. Analysis using ICP-OES and ICP-MS was then undertaken on the digests. Method validation was achieved through the analysis of the CRM ERM (R)–EZ505 electronic scrap. Results for the eight certified elements were in reasonable agreement with certified values (Be, Ni and Pd were 100 ± 1%, Au, Cu and In were 100 ± 11% and Pt was 100 ± 20%). The problematic analyte was Ag that had poor recovery and precision (75 ± 35%). This was attributed to the presence of hydrochloric acid in the digestion mixture. In addition to the eight certified elements, a further 49 were also determined. Analysis of the printed circuit boards demonstrated that the most abundant elements in decreasing order were Cu, Fe, Si, Ni, Sn, Zn, Ba, Al, Cr and Ti. These 10 analytes accounted for approximately 80% of the weight of the board. The other paper described the use of LIBS to determine In in liquid crystal displays of mobile phones.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit317"><sup><span class="sup_ref">317</span></sup></a> Two calibration strategies were compared: conventional univariate calibration and multi-energy calibration. After phone disassembly the indium tin oxide films were mixed with a resin and pressed into a pellet. For the multi-energy calibration model, two pellets were pressed. One with sample, a standard and cellulose binder and the other with sample plus a blank (silica). The full procedure and the strategy behind each calibration model was given in the text. Results were compared with the standard method of microwave assisted acid digestion (Method EPA 3052) followed by ICP-OES detection. All of the LIBS data showed greatest accuracy where the analyte signal was normalised against the signal at the C wavelength at 193.09 nm. This had to be performed before the data were input to either calibration model. The LOD and LOQ for the univariate calibration were 0.3 and 1 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively, compared with the multi-energy calibration values of 2.1 and 7 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The In content ranged from 35 to 47 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The conclusion was that both strategies could usefully be used for recycling and e-waste management.</p>

These were then heated to remove the magnetism and ground using a knife mill before being sieved. Several acid digestion approaches (microwave assisted and hot block) using different acid concentrations were compared. No suitable CRM was available and so spike/recovery tests were undertaken. Overall, the treatment providing best results was using 100 mg of sample and a hot block using 7 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> nitric acid. The elements present at highest concentration were Fe, Nd and Pr. The analytical data were input to PCA and Hyperspectral Image to help classify the disks.

Titanium nitride and nickel were tested as the bottom electrode material since they are both candidates to replace noble materials. All three techniques demonstrated significant inter-mixing between the titanium nitride and tantalum in the tantalum oxide titanium nitride stacks, even when optimised tantalum oxide deposition conditions were used. However, TOF-SIMS also demonstrated that if a H* plasma step was used during the atomic layer deposition process of the tantalum oxide, the oxidation of the Ni and the inter-mixing of tantalum oxide and Ni were both minimised. The X-ray-based techniques also indicated the influence of the H* plasma on the nickel – based samples when used with the model-based multi-layer combined analysis. It was concluded that GIXRF and XRR may be used as non-destructive and sensitive depth-profiling techniques.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The final sub-section of this part of the review is a <span class="italic">mixture of other sample types</span> that do not fit into any of the other sub-sections easily.

A simple liquid–liquid extraction using isopropanol and water was used to isolate the analytes of interest from the matrix and actually provide a preconcentration factor of approximately 19. Although some interfering species were also extracted, these could be overcome by use of an appropriate resolution factor on the SF-ICP-MS instrument.

        <h3 id="sect2199"><span class="b_heading">3.9 Nanostructures</span></h3>
        <span>Atomic spectrometry, through techniques such as XRD, XPS, XRF, single nanoparticle (sNP) ICP-MS and ICP-OES has a key role in the characterisation and detection of NPs with over 150 papers published in the period covered by this ASU. However, most of the articles only mention the technique(s) used without any further analytical detail and as such are not discussed here.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In any growing analytical field <span class="italic">method validation protocols and metrology</span> tend to develop at a slower rate than the methodologies used, although this should not be the case and a metrological approach should be the starting point for method development. It is timely then that the current status of NP detection, with a focus on analytical metrology, has been reviewed by Lopez-Sanz <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit323"><sup><span class="sup_ref">323</span></sup></a> The review (with 139 cited references) proposes some metrological definitions for NPs and covers the analytical methods used for both their characterisation and detection. The latter was split into two areas; methods in which NPs are used to extract and/or pre-concentrate other target analytes and methods where the NP is the analyte. After a brief section on microscopy-based techniques the main focus is on the use of separation by CE, FFF and LC coupled with a variety of detectors including dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle light scattering (MALS), ICP-MS and UV. The use of these techniques reported over the past five years was summarised in a table (60 references) with many also being discussed in the text. The authors pointed out that maintaining sample integrity during both analyte characterisation studies and detection methodologies is, as for any analysis, still the key to providing analytical validity. However, this can prove more challenging because of the tendency of NPs to aggregate and the wide range of complex matrices, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> from consumer products to biota, which may contain them. It was also pointed out that whilst NPs are available as standards, often containing a stabilising agent, with a given mass concentration, particle concentration, size or size distribution these parameters may change upon dilution (or other use) into a different matrix. A further problem highlighted is the lack of available CRMs for method validation and that, from a strict metrological point of view, recovery studies are only admissible when the other alternatives are not available. Bustos <span class="italic">et al.</span> at NIST reported on the validation of sNP ICP-MS for routine measurements of nanoparticle size and number size distribution.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit324"><sup><span class="sup_ref">324</span></sup></a> The validation comprised three stages: (i) calibration based on the certified particle size of NIST SRM 8013 (Au NPs); (ii) comparison with HR-SEM data as a reference method (which is traceable to the SI) and (iii) evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the measurement of the found mean particle size to enable comparison of the sNP ICP-MS and HR-SEM methods. After method optimisation the particle size results obtained for NIST SRMs 8012 and 8013 by sNP ICP-MS were 27.2 ± 0.1 and 54.1 ± 0.1 nm, respectively. These data were in good agreement with those obtained using HR-SEM of 27.0 ± 0.1 and 54.7 ± 0.4 nm, respectively and also with the certified values of 26.8 ± 0.1 and 54.7 ± 0.4 nm, respectively. The particle size distributions obtained by both methods for the two SRMs were also in good agreement with the sNP ICP-MS data showing a broader tail in both sides of the distribution than the HR-SEM data. Both analytical approaches were also used to characterise commercial AuNP suspensions of three different sizes (30, 60, and 100 nm). The measurements revealed the existence of two distinct sub-populations of particles in the number size distributions for four of the 60 nm commercial suspensions. The paper also gave a detailed account of the uncertainty estimations and concluded that additional work is still needed to establish the metrological traceability of sNP ICP-MS for NP size determination. This is because of the assumption that all particles are spherical and that the TEM data supplied by commercial producers of NPs may be inadequate.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In <span class="italic">single NP (sNP) ICP-MS analysis</span> it is usual, due to instrumental limitations on the need for rapid data collection and processing, for only one isotope to be monitored during an analytical run. Two research groups however have explored the acquisition of multiple isotope data using sNP ICP-MS. The first of these papers, by Naasz <span class="italic">et al.</span> explored the capabilities of two quadrupole ICP-MS and two TOF-ICP-MS instruments for determining the composition, size distribution, and concentration of BiVO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, (Bi<small><sub>0.5</sub></small>Na<small><sub>0.5</sub></small>)TiO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, steel (IRMM-383 CRM) and Au-core/Ag-shell NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit325"><sup><span class="sup_ref">325</span></sup></a> Both instrument types used could estimate the size of Au-core/Ag-shell NPs with uncertainties ranging from 25 to 50% relative. Measurements by the two quadrupole ICP-MS instruments generally had the lower uncertainty estimate. For the other multi-element nanoparticles, the particle sizes found were not in agreement with those obtained from analysis using SEM. The data presented for the particle number concentration appears acceptable for the Au/Ag NPs but again differences were reported with the SEM data for the other types of NP analysed. The particle mass concentration presented again shows poor agreement with the expected values. These differences between the expected and found data were attributed to aggregation and/or agglomeration of the NPs in solution prior to analysis. Thus, these results emphasise the need for maintaining sample integrity prior to analysis as highlighted in the previous paragraph. With regard to identifying multi-element NPs, the TOF instruments could determine the four different elements in the steel NP ion cloud simultaneously without a reduction in sensitivity. This was not the case for the two quadrupole ICP-MS instruments. This is, in part, because of the much greater number of data points that can be acquired during a single particle event which were calculated to be up to 15 for TOF-ICP-MS and 1 to 2 for quadrupole ICP-MS. The paper by Hirata <span class="italic">et al.</span> (in Japanese) on multi-isotope sNP ICP-MS used a MC-ICP-MS instrument, equipped with a high-time resolution data integration system, to measure the elemental composition, the <small><sup>195</sup></small>Pt<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/><small><sup>194</sup></small>Pt ratio and particle size distribution of Pt and Au/Pt NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit326"><sup><span class="sup_ref">326</span></sup></a> Sample introduction was by the laser ablation in a liquid technique, the Pt signals were measured using Daly counters whilst the Au signal was monitored on the electron multiplier of the instrument. The results obtained showed that the repeatability of the isotope ratio measurements was mainly controlled by the counting statistics of the signal. This suggested that effective data acquisition could be achieved under transient signals produced from the NPs. Both the measured NP size and the Au<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>Pt ratio of the NPs varied significantly with changes in the laser ablation conditions and possible mechanisms for these observed variations were discussed in the paper.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">With all analytical techniques there is <span class="italic">a continual quest to improve the methodologies</span> and NP analysis is no exception. The use of an online micro-droplet calibration approach, with the aim of achieving matrix independent nanoparticle sizing, was reported by Hendriks <span class="italic">et al.</span> this year.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit327"><sup><span class="sup_ref">327</span></sup></a> To achieve this, a micro-droplet generator, which included a desolvation device, was inserted between the spray chamber outlet and the torch of the ICP-TOF-MS instrument. A calibrated video camera was used to determine the size of the micro-droplets introduced. Thus, conventionally aspirated NPs and the calibrants in the micro-droplets were introduced simultaneously to the instrument. After optimisation, which included sampling depth, nebuliser gas flow, acid related matrix effects and accounting for space charge effects, the method was applied to the determination of Au NPs in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The PBS attenuated the Au signal, with a decrease in attenuation observed with decreasing PBS concentration, such that the measured mean particle size decreased, and the size distribution broadened with increasing PBS concentration. The authors pointed out that ‘real’ samples could be diluted prior to analysis to reduce matrix effects but that this is not always possible if the number of NPs in the original sample is low. In addition, it was also noted that matrix matching of the calibrants and samples could also be undertaken. It would have been of great interest to see the latter approach undertaken here and the results obtained with the micro-droplet calibration approach compared with calibrants prepared in PBS. For sNP analysis it is necessary to know the sample transport efficiency of the analyte to the plasma and this is usually measured by either analysing a NP standard or gravimetrically. It can also be advantageous to have a high transport efficiency value if the sample size is limited or if it has low analyte concentrations. The transport efficiencies of three different sample transport systems were assessed by Lin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit328"><sup><span class="sup_ref">328</span></sup></a> These were: a high-performance concentric nebulizer with a heated cyclonic spray chamber and a three-stage Peltier-cooled desolvation system (HPCN), a conventional sample introduction system and a total consumption system. In each case the sample flow rate was estimated gravimetrically and for the HPCN and total consumption systems the sample was introduced <span class="italic">via</span> a sample loop of 60 and 100 μL, (with flow rates of 10 and 100 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), respectively. Commercially available Pt nanoparticles with a size of 70 nm were diluted to a concentration range of 60 to 1.2 × 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> particles per mL for the study. The transport efficiencies of the conventional sample introduction system, the total consumption system, and the HPCN were 10.6, 99.4, and 103.6%, respectively with the lower value for conventional nebulisation attributed to the smaller Sauter mean diameter obtained from this device. The size detection limits obtained were 11.6, 11.6, and 7.2 nm for the conventional sample introduction system, total consumption system and HPCN-APEX, respectively whilst the particle number LOD values were 126, 154 and 14, respectively. Interestingly the sensitivity, on a signal intensity per Pt mass basis was similar for all three systems.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The linear dynamic range of sNP can be limited by momentary signal pulse pile-ups at the electron multiplier detector. These can be mitigated by signal broadening from the use of a collision gas in ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit329"><sup><span class="sup_ref">329</span></sup></a> In this study by Rush <span class="italic">et al.</span> the simultaneous secondary electron multiplier was operated in both dual (pulse counting switching to analog) and pulse counting only modes. With no collision gas and the electron multiplier in dual mode, the linear response for Au NPs was from 20 to 150 nm whilst with He as a collision gas the linear range extended to 250 nm. In pulse counting mode, both with and without the He collision gas, the linear response was reduced to 20 to 60 nm. This is presumably due to detector overload from the increased signal from particles larger than 60 nm in diameter. It is now possible to acquire sNP data with a dwell time as short as 10 μs. The effect of using the short dwell times of 10, 20, 50, and 100 μs was investigated by Kana <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit330"><sup><span class="sup_ref">330</span></sup></a> It was found that zero signal values occurred inside the transient signal corresponding to an individual NP with the probability of this increasing with decreasing dwell time and NP size. This leads to the false detection of a larger number of smaller peaks with a consequent effect on the calculated particle size distribution. Therefore, a new approach to identifying the ‘true’ particle signal was developed which consisted of searching for an uninterrupted zero signal point sequence with a total length of 50 μs or 100 μs. Only the 100 μs delay between adjacent peaks resulted in values of the number of detected peaks, the most frequent peak areas and the width of peak area distribution that were virtually independent of the dwell time. The same research group then applied the method to the detection of Ag NPs in water samples collected from river Vltava in the Czechia.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit331"><sup><span class="sup_ref">331</span></sup></a> The Ag NP content ranged from 0.1 to 3.2 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with a particle size range of 32 to 1114 nm and a number concentration range of 340 to 1670 particles mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with uncertainties in the latter two values in the range of 40 and 15%, respectively.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A number of reports on the use of <span class="italic">separation techniques coupled with ICP-MS for the detection of NPs</span> have been published in the period covered by this review.

Oxygen was used as a reaction gas for S and Se measurements, as <small><sup>48</sup></small>S<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>80</sup></small>Se<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> respectively, whilst <small><sup>106</sup></small>Cd was measured directly. As the Cd and S content of the quantum dots and the S content of the antibody was known the measured signal from the AF4 peaks in the fractogram could be used to calculate the quantum dot to Ab ratio, with full details of these calculations given in the paper. The authors concluded that the proposed approach is general and could be applied to any type of NP containing S in the core, shell or on surface attached ligands and conjugated to any S containing biomolecules. Iron-carbohydrate NPs are used to treat iron-deficiency anaemia but regulatory acceptance of generic forms of this drug is hampered by lack of a direct method to monitor the fate of Fe NPs in clinical samples. An HPLC-ICP-MS based method has thus been developed by Neu <span class="italic">et al.</span> to address this.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit333"><sup><span class="sup_ref">333</span></sup></a> The separation of the NPs from serum samples was undertaken using two SEC columns (3 μm, 300 Å, 4.6 mm × 300 mm and 3 μm, 300 Å, 4.6 mm × 50 mm) in series with a mobile phase of 10 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Tris (pH 7.4) flowing at 0.4 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in 20 min. This allowed the separation of the Fe drug from other iron binding species, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> transferrin, albumin, ferritin and citrate. The ICP-MS was operated in collision cell mode with He as the collision gas with a solution of transferrin, introduced by a post-column switching valve used to monitor signal drift at the beginning and end of each HPLC separation. Peak identification of the compounds eluted was by fraction collection and either matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI)-MS or ES-MS. The HPLC-ICP-MS LOD value for the Fe drug was 0.3 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The transformations of Au NPs in a cell culture medium, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, which contained 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, were studied by Lopez-Sanz <span class="italic">et al.</span> using AF4-ICP-MS with the AF4 carrier solution being 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit334"><sup><span class="sup_ref">334</span></sup></a> The AF4-ICP-MS fractograms showed that the culture medium induced oxidation of the Au NPs to ionic Au which was subsequently conjugated with proteins or other matrix components. An increase in Au NP size was also observed which the authors suggested could be due to the formation of a protein corona or to an aggregation/agglomeration process. Most reports on NP detection cover aqueous environmental or biological samples but this year sees a report by Ruhland <span class="italic">et al.</span> of the FFFF-ICP-MS detection of natural NPs present in a gas condensate sample using tetrahydrofuran as the carrier liquid.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> The results obtained confirmed the presence of various NPs and colloids, some containing aromatic compounds as well as various metals, including Hg in the gas condensate. Offline sNP ICP-MS was used to confirm the presence of the Hg-containing NPs which were identified as HgS by STEM-EDX. Other particulate matter containing Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, P, S, Se, Ti, V and Zn was also identified which could make the upstream use of the gas condensate problematic if, for example, catalysis is involved. Tan <span class="italic">et al.</span> coupled a differential mobility analyser with an ICP-MS instrument operated in sNP mode to determine the geometry of Au nanorods.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit335"><sup><span class="sup_ref">335</span></sup></a> The differential mobility analyser step size was 2 nm with a step dwell time of 31 s and samples were introduced <span class="italic">via</span> electrospray.
