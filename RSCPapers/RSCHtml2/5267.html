      <span>
        <span class="bold">Peter Styring</span> opened discussion of the introductory lecture by Volker Sick: If you were talking to a key politician/decision maker, what would you say to convince them that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilisation was an area on which they should focus attention?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> replied: It will be important to emphasize that carbon dioxide utilization (CDU) not only helps us to address climate change effects but also can create economic value and employment opportunities while securing our perpetual demand for carbon-containing materials and products.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Samantha Eleanor Tanzer</span> asked: How would the idea that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> avoidance trump reduced energy use fit into a world with a constrained availability of low-CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> power?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> answered: At present the increased energy need for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilization certainly creates a dilemma – often addressed in the literature as opportunity cost. However, the scenario looks better once we look at a more distant future when carbon-free energy supplies will have increased, and do factor in that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> avoidance is more important than lowest possible energy use. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilization can further help drive the deployment of carbon-free energy conversion technologies. That needs to go hand in hand with the development of CDU technologies. We cannot wait to develop CDU until there is a surplus of carbon-free energy; there needs to be symbiotic growth.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> enquired: Governments postpone environmental issues seen as not profitable/not urgent. As discussed in your talk, climate change is an issue that should have been addressed yesterday and not in 20–30 years. Is there anything we could do as a part of trying to convince politicians?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> answered: Our community needs to inform, explain the environmental opportunities that can be created through CDU technologies and show how these will have a local impact also on employment opportunities.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Xiangkun Elvis Cao</span> asked: There are many methods for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and utilization. My question is centered around the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to fuels. Of the different catalytic methods, would you be able to offer insights into what the shared challenges would be for scaling up these different technical pathways (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, photocatalytic, thermocatalytic, electrocatalytic methods, <span class="italic">etc.</span>)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> responded: This is a very broad question and I think that the answer will have to be nuanced, largely based on local conditions and opportunities. I do not see a clear winning category amongst the technologies you list.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Richard Catlow</span> requested: Can you comment on the feasibility of removing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at scale from the atmosphere using Direct Air Capture.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> replied: Fundamentally it is possible to do this at scale and plans are underway for a 1 million ton per year facility in the US. Opportunities to increase the capacity of the sorbents as well as the energy efficiency have not been exhausted at all. Therefore, direct air carbon capture will require less land to deploy and the energy demands will also decrease. It is important to note that while the capture plants could be set up in non-arable regions, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> deserts, along with solar or wind power generation, we also need to factor in the downstream CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilization processes and their location. Though, along with capturing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, water is usually also extracted from the air, and that could be used in conjunction with the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for on-site reformulation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Walter Leitner</span> questioned: Would it not be better to move from end-of-pipe regulation to taxing fossil carbon at source – are we putting the price tag in the right place?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> responded: It seems indeed simpler to tax at the source from an accounting perspective, to reduce the effort in tracking the taxation, and to ensure completeness of covering all fossil carbon sources. However, such a model would require the implementation of mechanisms that could address social issues of this tax. Furthermore, a thorough examination is required of the impact that it might have on the willingness to invest in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture technologies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Styring</span> noted: Through the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) system in the UK we have recently made recommendations on possible fiscal interventions to enable products derived from recycled carbon to become competitive. These include a reasonable carbon tax and reducing the VAT (sales tax) on low carbon products and fuels to 0% while increasing VAT on products based on fossil carbon to the standard 20%.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> responded: I believe that incentives like what you describe can have a powerful impact with consumers. The combination of buying a product that is better for the environment and paying less for it creates a strong motivation. Related government action in Germany to support the introduction of unleaded gasoline had shown the desired effect.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ollie Thomas</span> said: You indicated early in your presentation that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is often prohibitively expensive, thus dis-incentivising the uptake of CDU techniques which require pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> feedstock. As such do we need, at least in the short term, carbon capture technologies to outstrip those for utilisation to ensure demand is outstripped by supply, and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be made cheap enough to be an economically attractive feedstock and avoid price inflation as CDU strategies are adopted and demand rises?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> answered: I believe that technologies to capture and those to use CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> need to and will be developed in parallel. There must be a clear message, <span class="italic">e.g. via</span> procurement requirements and incentives, that there is a need for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilization to incentivize efforts to advance capture technologies. In addition, efforts should increase to develop utilization technologies that can use CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> streams directly from emission sources without capture steps.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ollie Thomas</span> enquired: What, in your opinion, are the greatest barriers to ensuring a stable relationship between CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> supply and demand? What steps need to be taken to ensure CDU is economically viable and sustainable?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> replied: Ultimately, supply and demand will be market driven, even when incentivized with policy instruments. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> will become an attractive non-fossil source of carbon as a replacement raw material because customers will demand it and cost will be competitive through regulatory means and of course economies of scale. Additionally, new better products can be developed that do not even exist without the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and thereby new demand will be created.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Deepak Pant</span> asked: In slide 31, what was the economic price of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concretes scoring green? Higher or lower than normal concrete. Idea to show both in future.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> answered: The price for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concretes is currently mostly higher than that of regular concrete. However, in combination with the use of supplementary cementitious materials, that otherwise might be waste products, alternative forms of cement with lower energy cost, potentially much longer service life, and the potential to reduce steel reinforcements when engineered cementitious composites are used, the cost can actually be competitive.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jeffrey Poon</span> said: The presentation (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=d1fd00029b" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/d1fd00029b">10.1039/d1fd00029b</a>) has showcased interesting technological solutions to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilisation. A particularly interesting aspect is the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the curing of concrete. According to a 2018 Chatham House Report,<small><sup>1</sup></small> then reported by the BBC, concrete accounts for 8% of worldwide carbon emissions. Do the technologies described, advances in materials science notwithstanding, reduce the carbon emissions of concrete (which is pretty good)? Or do they actually achieve net negative emission?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">1 J. Lehne and F. Preston, <span class="italic">Making Concrete Change: Innovation in Low-carbon Cement and Concrete</span>, Chatham House Report, 2018, https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete.</p>

For state of the art CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sequestering concretes close to 10% of their mass could be from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Changing the formulation for making concrete, including the use of carbonated aggregates and supplementary cementitious materials, such as steel slag, can potentially bind more than 1 gigatonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> per year, substantially reducing the environmental burden of construction. Some of those formulations indeed bear the potential for net negative emissions.</p>

In the past, large scale disruptive changes seem to have had a better lobby, thinking of the incredible speed the ammonia synthesis <span class="italic">via</span> Haber–Bosch was established. Now it feels a lot of new processes are dying in the ‘valley of death’ because they do not offer the quick return in investment. It is a little like a Mexican stand off, new processes are not implemented because the financials are not working at the moment and financial incentives from governments are not implemented widely because there is no real industry/lobby this would benefit yet.</p>

        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> replied: From what I observe, interest in CDU technologies in the private sector is increasing rapidly. However, many look for ‘gigatonne’ opportunities and neglect the smaller opportunities. I agree with you that the time horizon for a return of investment is too long for many investors – but not all. Changes in policy support are being developed and begin to get noticed and that helps. But it is still necessary to emphasize the need for CDU and the long term opportunities, beyond helping to fix the climate crisis. In contrast to the race for a viable ammonia synthesis to address the world population rapidly moving towards starvation, climate change is not broadly recognized and accepted as an urgent life threatening problem and therefore does not receive the same level of attention (yet).</p>

Our market study and Global Roadmap<small><sup>1</sup></small> shows that in particular the market for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-sequestering construction materials (concrete, aggregates) can grow to this level and offer an opportunity as permanent carbon sinks.

The study did not mention to those polled that CDU products (at present) are more expensive than traditional materials. Price is always an issue for consumers and rapid market penetration of products that replace an equivalent but cheaper product will be very slow at best.

        <span class="bold">Volker Sick</span> answered: I believe that all of the technology categories that were covered in the presentation can be successful. Achieving competitive cost is paramount, no production ever works with a perpetual financial loss.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> added: My personal view is that due to the great challenge of reducing our carbon print, there will not be a unique technique/solution. Ideally, we will reach a point where our energy is produced entirely from renewables, and the energy vector would be based on hydrogen and not on carbon. However, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture and utilisation would play a key role in the production of carbon based chemicals. During the energy turnover from C-based to H-based energy vectors, fuels produced from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> revalorisation would be very important. Renewable fuels (based on CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture and revalorisation) would allow recycling of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> associated with energy-extensive processes, however, at its end use will be combusted to produce energy and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> will be eventually emitted. Thus, atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> must also be efficiently captured and recycled. Lower CDU cost would attract the attention of companies as it would be more economically profitable. However, I think there is a strong social drive for green procedures, and probably some consumers would pay an extra cost if ensured the process is completely CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> neutral/negative.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> replied: At low temperature (below 270 °C) methanol is efficiently dehydrated to DME over solid acid catalysts, without the formation of significant by-products. The dehydration of methanol to DME is a mature process that occurs efficiently at a similar temperature to methanol synthesis. If DME is the desired product, then a cheaper methanol catalyst based on Cu could be employed, and one should focus on optimising the reaction parameters (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> pressure, temperature, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratio, space time velocity, recycling ratio) instead of developing new catalysts.</p>

The methanol/DME conversion to gasoline or light olefins is also a viable commercial process with several plants in operation.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> responded: We think that the main role of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is to disperse the PdZn alloy nanoparticles, as its surface area is higher than ZnO (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 50 compared to <span class="italic">ca.</span> 15 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).

        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> replied: Palladium on its own is an active catalyst for the reverse water gas shift reaction (CO formation) and for the methanation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to methane; however, it is not active for the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to methanol.

So, an innovative strategy in this field is to minimize the usage of precious metals without compromising the catalytic performance through single-atom catalysts (SACs), which contain isolated metal atoms singly dispersed on a catalyst support. This strategy allows the reduction of metal loads. Have you tried to determine the presence of SACs in your catalytic systems?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> responded: Good suggestion, non-alloyed Pd is active for the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) to CO. My feeling is that atomically distributed Pd would still be very active for the RWGS reaction, unless supported on a reducible support (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> ZnO, Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>). It would be an excellent opportunity for further research.

      <p class="otherpara">On a related note, at this discussion meeting there were a couple of posters discussing the particle size towards methanol and methane synthesis over Cu and Ni nanoparticles.

        <span class="bold">George Dowson</span> asked: Your process gives an interesting array of longer-chain compounds, some of which may be very valuable as the basis of low carbon fuels or other feedstocks. Would you be able to test what would happen if the catalyst is supplied with vaporised DME or methanol as the feed gas, rather than CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>? If so, this distribution of chemicals may allow insight into the formation of the longer chain compounds.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> replied: In our catalytic set up it is challenging to add CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH or DME, and we have not tested the proposed experiment. It would be interesting to perform the suggested experiment and observe if the hybrid catalysts (mixture of a methanol catalyst and a solid acid catalyst) change the hydrocarbon distribution compared to parent zeolites. However, based on the literature available for both the synthesis of hydrocarbons from methanol/DME and the synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> using a combination of a methanol catalyst and a solid acid catalyst we could state the following:</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The hydrocarbon distribution is generally dictated by the zeolite used. For instance, ZSM-5 zeolites are employed for the synthesis of longer chain hydrocarbons (commercially used in the methanol-to-gasoline process), whilst SAPO-34 are employed when light olefins (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>–C<small><sub>4</sub></small>) are the desired products (commercially used in the methanol-to-olefins process). The difference in the hydrocarbon distribution is related to the zeolite framework and porous structure. ZSM-5 have large cavities where long chain hydrocarbons can be formed, and pore apertures big enough for those hydrocarbons to diffuse out of the zeolite structure. SAPO-34 consists of one dimensional channels, without enough space for the production of long chain hydrocarbons. Hence, to optimise the hydrocarbon distribution, the first step would be to focus on methanol/DME conversion, and not on CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to hydrocarbons. The methanol synthesis catalyst mixed with the solid acid catalyst can influence the hydrocarbon distribution, for instance, it is observed in the literature that Cu-based catalysts not only act as methanol synthesis sites, but also as olefin hydrogenation centers, limiting the synthesis of olefins or hydrocarbon chain growth. For example, on a zeolite that yields ethene the production of ethane could be observed over a hybrid catalyst. Or over a zeolite that yields hydrocarbons in the gasoline range, shorter hydrocarbons would be detected over hybrid catalysts.</p>

However, we have not done temperature cycles to check if the activity remains the same. However, catalyst deactivation through palladium hydride is not likely to be a major concern, since the hydride is only stable at low temperature and decomposes above room temperature. The main deactivation mechanism for this system would be:</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> replied: For the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into hydrocarbons, the main difference between the CO mediated route, or Fischer-Tropsch (FT), and the methanol mediated route is the achievable hydrocarbon distribution. The hydrocarbon distribution through a FT route is controlled by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution, hence, low selectivity towards hydrocarbons in the gasoline range is expected. In contrast, for the CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH mediated route, the formation of hydrocarbons follows a different mechanism and high selectivity towards targeted products is in theory feasible.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> responded: In our study products were analyzed on line through a GC but were not recovered. However, methanol plants from both CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and syngas are operational. In methanol plants (efficiency above 85%), methanol is recovered in a condenser and gas products (CO/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and non-reacted gases (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) are recycled into the feed. DME can be easily liquified, and hence, can be easily separated from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> gases. If oxygenates (methanol/DME) are the desired products, operational conditions can be optimised to avoid the synthesis of undesired hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Under the studied conditions the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and methanol selectivity was <span class="italic">ca.</span> 13 and <span class="italic">ca.</span> 15% respectively. However, this is not an optimised process, the introduction of a recycling loop would reduce significantly the reverse water gas shift reaction and improve methanol productivity. Moreover, methanol productivity can be improved by increasing the reaction pressure and tuning the space time velocity. Under our non-optimised reaction conditions, methanol was efficiently dehydrated to DME. Methanol was detected in our case because it is also being formed at the end of the catalyst bed. Adding only ZSM-5 at the end of the catalyst bed would translate into no methanol being detected.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In our case, the less efficient step is the conversion of methanol/DME to hydrocarbons (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 40% methanol/DME converted to hydrocarbons), however, this process is normally carried out at elevated temperatures (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 400 °C), and hence, there is room for optimisation.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> responded: Interesting point that needs to be addressed. In our system we detected C<small><sub>2</sub></small>–C<small><sub>4</sub></small> alkanes, and C<small><sub>4</sub></small>–C<small><sub>5</sub></small> alkenes. One possibility is that shorter olefins, with less steric impediments, hydrogenate faster than longer olefins. Another possibility, however, is that C<small><sub>2</sub></small>–C<small><sub>4</sub></small> products formed in early stages on the catalyst bed are hydrogenated, but longer olefins formed at the end of the catalyst bed have not interacted with the PdZn phase. Increasing the flow or diluting the catalyst with an inert phase could translate into higher selectivity towards olefins. However, the PdZn phase will still be active towards olefin hydrogenation.

        <span class="bold">Mzamo Shozi</span> asked: How would the catalyst activity and product selectivity compare if you used PdZn/ZSM-5? Also I assume monometallic versions of your catalysts are not as effective as the bimetallic, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> Pd/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–ZSM-5?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> replied: The conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to hydrocarbons occurs through two consecutive reactions. First, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is hydrogenated to methanol over PdZn sites. Methanol is then converted into hydrocarbons over acid sites in the ZSM-5 framework. A PdZn/ZSM-5 catalyst has the potential to be used in the same manner as our PdZn/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-ZSM-5 catalyst. However, some diffusion limitations might apply. For instance, if PdZn is deposited at the surface of the zeolite it can block the access of methanol into the pore structure, or block the release of hydrocarbons formed within the pore structure. The same could be observed if PdZn is deposited within the ZSM-5 pores. Regarding the second part of the question, when only Pd is used as the catalyst primarily CO and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> are observed, with almost no methanol formation. Meanwhile, the activity of Zn is comparatively lower than that of the PdZn system.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Ruiz Esquius</span> answered: This overall process has not been optimised, but it produced high value products. If high selectivity towards a set of desired products is achieved, final products are of great interest.

      <p class="otherpara">CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH and DME can be converted into high value products such as light olefins (ethene and propene are among the most produced chemicals). An optimised process, out of the scope of our work, would enable for the production of light olefins in a one-pass reactor, which would be more economically profitable than combining the two processes in parallel (CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH synthesis, and CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH to olefins).</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nora de Leeuw</span> responded: Experimentally, we have not yet tried other materials. Fe–Co or Ni–Co would be the next choice, as the latter is also a readily available sulfide material in nature, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> siegenite. Siegenite is a thiospinel material which is structurally similar to violarite and greigite, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> both materials that show promise as catalysts for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation.

      <p class="otherpara">Our simulations of the partially oxidised surface of violarite (<span class="italic">o</span>-FeNi<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>4</sub></small>) suggest that the “imperfect” packing of two types of cations and two types of anions with different sizes is a fundamental requirement of the active catalyst. The minimum energy pathways (MEP) as well as the binding and desorption of the H atoms, carbonate species, intermediates and transition states is only possible on the imperfect surface of a partially oxidised Fe–Ni sulfide. We have not yet simulated the conversion of carbonate into formate on the partially oxidised surface of other mixed-metal sulfide phases. However, we have shown in a previous study that the bulk phases of Daubréelite (FeCr<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>4</sub></small>), FeMn<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>4</sub></small>, FeCo<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>4</sub></small> and violarite (FeNi<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>4</sub></small>) have different degrees of inversion and density of states,<small><sup>1</sup></small> which will certainly give them unique catalytic properties, but they have still to be tested.</p>

        <span class="bold">Nora de Leeuw</span> replied: The VASP code is particularly useful for the modelling of heterogeneous catalytic reactions as it employs periodic boundary conditions to reduce the number of atoms needed to represent crystalline solids. Standard meta-generalised gradient approximations (meta-GGA), such as the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semi-local density functional fail to describe the experimental bandgap in insulators and semiconductors, as well as the long-range dispersion forces, which are required for a proper description of the molecular interactions.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nora de Leeuw</span> responded: This is certainly an important aspect that needs to be considered. The first and foremost hurdle would be the cost of the precursors and other additives. We use iron(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) acetylacetonate Fe(acac)<small><sub>2</sub></small> (99.9%), nickel(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) acetylacetonate Ni(acac)<small><sub>2</sub></small>, oleylamine and elemental sulfur. We haven’t studied the synthesis with other cheaper precursors like nitrates or halides. From a technical point of view, this synthesis must be carried out under completely inert atmosphere, which may be challenging. As reported in our earlier work,<small><sup>1</sup></small> the surface oxygen plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity. Hence the exposure of these catalysts to oxidising atmosphere should be controlled and this will impose challenges in handling of these materials. A detailed study should be carried out on the relationship between oxidising conditions, surface oxygen level and activity before optimising the synthesis and handling conditions.</p>

In fact, when CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was added as a reactant, the productivity of formate decreased, we believe because adding CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to an already heavily concentrated bicarbonate system, causes a decrease in pH by the acidic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissolution, pushing the equilibrium of the carbonate species towards a CO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>2−</sup></small> dominant system, and away from the reactant carbonate species HCO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small>.

        <span class="bold">Nora de Leeuw</span> replied: We have already worked extensively with oxidising Fe<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>S based material both in air and under calcination.<small><sup>1</sup></small> In this work, we serendipitously found that aging this iron sulfide in air for 30 days improved the activity of the material, which inspired us to calcine the material to accelerate this effect.

This raises the possible question of exchange. Are the oxygens of the departing formate the same as those of the original carbonate molecule or has there been exchange with the surface? Have you any intention of perusing isotopic labelling studies to check this prediction, exchange or no exchange, of your model to provide further validation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nora de Leeuw</span> answered: This is a very interesting hypothesis. For our simulations, we did not consider atomic exchange between the surface and the adsorbates, but we cannot rule out this possibility either. Certainly, it is possible to carry out further studies using isotopic labelling and computational modelling to test the possibility of atomic exchange.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ollie Thomas</span> queried: Your studies indicate that catalytic activity is highly sensitive to surface structure ((001) <span class="italic">cf.</span> (111)). Do you anticipate there being issues with catalytic lifetime due to surface degradation through catalytic cycling? How stable is the surface with respect to RedOx processes under the reaction conditions, as your calcination studies suggest oxidation strongly deactivates the catalyst? Have you tried perhaps varying the pH of the reacting solution? If you do anticipate there being degradation would perhaps a supported version of the catalyst protect against this and maybe even help promote the favourable spatial configuration indicated in Fig. 6(a) in your paper (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=d0fd00137f" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/d0fd00137f">10.1039/d0fd00137f</a>)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nora de Leeuw</span> responded: Preliminary characterisation of the spent catalyst shows evidence of catalyst degradation to FeCO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and NiSO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, and we therefore think that the catalyst will deactivate over time. However, the mode of deactivation and the factors affecting the deactivation pathways need detailed investigation. We have not yet tried optimising the pH of the starting solution. The challenge is that as of the moment that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is introduced to the reaction mixture the pH decreases which is very difficult to control. We measure the pH of the initial reaction mixture (pH = 14) which at the moment that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is introduced reduces to pH = 8, where the reactant bicarbonate species dominates. Currently we do not have any lead to establish the relationship between the pH and the catalyst stability. Supporting the catalyst is an interesting suggestion and we will certainly look into this possibility.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ali Reza Kamali</span> asked: Thank you Wijnand for your nice presentation and very interesting work. I have a question about the formation of molybdenum (oxy) carbides with different stoichiometry reported in the work. Some XRD patterns are shown in the ESI of your paper (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=d0fd00138d" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/d0fd00138d">10.1039/d0fd00138d</a>), but the diffraction peaks are typically very weak and broad, and can be attributed to many semi-amorphous materials. Have you done complementary characterisations to confirm the formation of such phases? Also, there are EDS elemental mapping results of the catalysts in the article, but these mappings only show Mo, Si and O. I am wondering why carbon is not involved in these analyses?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Wijnand Marquart</span> replied: Thank you for the question. The molybdenum carbide allotrope phases were indeed mainly characterized by means of XRD. Rietveld refinement on these samples (specifically on the SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> supported samples) was challenging but we are confident of the results, confirmed by the quality of the fits. The contrast between the bulk metal oxide support materials (Ga-, Al-, Zr- and Ti oxide) and the carbide nanoparticles are large, which increased the insecurity of the Rietveld refinement analysis. In a previous study from our labs,<small><sup>1</sup></small> we have attempted to distinguish the Mo allotropes by means of <span class="italic">in situ</span> XAS analysis. Analysis of the EXAFS region has confirmed that no α-MoC phase was present. This supports the suggestion of the MoO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>C<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> phase being present, as the XRD diffraction patterns of α-MoC and MoO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>C<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> are very similar (both cubic structures). Further investigations are required to support our suggested compositions.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">“Important geometric and electronic information about the lowest energy adsorption modes for carbon dioxide on top of each silicon carbide surface are given in Fig. S5 of the ESI document. These data show that whilst the average metal–oxygen bond distance between the surface and adsorbate is modulated almost completely by the ideal M–C bond distance the amount of charge transfer (and corresponding elongation of the C–O bond length) varies depending on the periodic position of the parent transition metal. Importantly, group IV metals (Ti/V) see an increase of ∼0.6 in electron transferred to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> upon adsorption from the values observed for their V metal equivalents (Zr/Nb), which correspond to both greater activation of the adsorbate and a more exothermic adsorption energy.”</p>

We are more encouraged by the performance of the oxidised surface and as we would expect the formation of such a surface to dominate under reaction conditions this would be our first target.

        <span class="bold">Matthew Quesne</span> answered: As this question implies there is clearly a lot of overlap between the properties associated with good activity towards the WGS reaction (as catalysed by the MAX-phase of the parent carbides) and the surface properties that we report for the silicon carbide.

        <span class="bold">Keith Whiston</span> opened discussion of the paper by Stylianos Kyrimis: It is usually difficult in a continuous fixed bed reactor of this type to carry out product distribution analysis through the bed but instead usually one is constrained to measuring the final bed exit product distribution. It is however sometimes easier to measure temperature gradients along the bed length and these can be quite sensitive. Although the temperature differences may be small I wondered if you had tried to discriminate between reaction mechanisms by making such temperature measurements? The two kinetic models predict quite different distributions of exotherm along the bed. For sure heat loss from such a small scale test rig makes these measurements challenging.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stylianos Kyrimis</span> responded: Thank you for your suggestion. It is indeed an interesting idea which can help us to better understand and quantify the reaction profile along the bed. Non-invasive measurements of any quantity, however, are challenging. Even if a thermocouple could be placed within the catalytic bed without disturbing the flow profile, then accurate measurements would still be challenging. Small-scale reactors, such as the one considered here (0.4 g of catalyst and bed height of around 16 mm), have really small changes in their operating parameters. As indicated by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, the temperature hotspot was less than 1 K and the pressure drop was around 140 Pa in an operating pressure of 50 bar. Minor changes such as these would require very precise apparatus to accurately and reliably measure. In addition, as you mentioned, small-scale reactors also suffer from heat losses. During the meeting, it has been suggested that IR measurements could be used. Indeed, this methodology would be more suitable compared to a thermocouple, as IR measurements of temperature are really sensitive and could potentially measure the temperature profile along the bed. However, as I am not really familiar with this technique, I would be hesitant to further comment on an IR application with a small-scale MeOH synthesis reactor setup. Undoubtedly, changes in the operating parameters, such as temperature or pressure, which affect and are affected by the catalytic bed morphology, are easier to measure in large-scale reactors. There, the catalytic bed is in the order of metres, and changes in the aforementioned parameters will be significant. As the operating procedure can greatly impact the performance of large-scale reactors, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> large temperature hotspots can lead to runaway conditions or catalyst sintering and increased pressure drops will increase the operating costs due to the requirement for stronger compressors, accurate monitoring and precise control of these effects are crucial. On the other hand, small-scale reactors are better suited to quantify the reaction kinetics. In those, the temperature and hydrodynamic profile of the bed are really minor and are thus not expected to significantly affect the equilibrium or reaction rate profile.</p>

        <span class="bold">George Dowson</span> asked: The major difference between the two reactions followed in your model is the by-production of water, which is present in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation but absent in CO hydrogenation. You mention briefly in your paper (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=d0fd00136h" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/d0fd00136h">10.1039/d0fd00136h</a>) the inhibitive effect of water – is this a chemical effect that is being modelled, or essentially just a physical dilution effect in the model? <span class="italic">I.e.</span> is your model including any chemical reactions that the water may cause or is the water treated as inert and hence inhibits the reactivity due to diluting the components at the reaction sites?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stylianos Kyrimis</span> replied: In CFD, molecular species interactions with the active sites cannot be modelled. Instead, the interactions between the different species and between the species and the catalyst can only be approximated with kinetic equations. For example, in the two kinetic models (KM), competitive adsorption of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> is considered, and thus the existence (in terms of partial pressure) of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O will affect the overall equilibrium and reaction rate. Therefore, as you mentioned, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is considered as an inert species, with its existence shifting the equilibrium and modifying the reaction rate of the reaction(s) where it is involved.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">CFD breaks down the catalytic bed into small computational elements, where, in each one, the species transfer, concentration and reactions are calculated. Based on these concentrations, the direction of chemical reactions is calculated. Looking closer at the MeOH synthesis case, and specifically feed 23, it can be seen how the production and existence of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O shifts the equilibrium. The excess production of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O early in the bed, as predicted from Park’s KM, inhibits MeOH hydrogenation; past the axial length of 0.1, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation rate drops significantly and instead the forward water–gas shift takes place primarily (towards production of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>). Of course, that doesn’t mean that CFD is restricted to estimating the impact of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O simply as an inert species. This is a really interesting opportunity for different tools to be combined; if the impact of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is more severe than what is predicted from the KMs and from the CFD, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> if it deactivates the active sites or, as you mention, serves a different role as a part of a side-reaction, then the KMs and CFD can be modified accordingly to also account for this possibility.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">George Dowson</span> added: Thank you for your answer, this clarifies some of the model behaviour when looking at how water is treated and is interesting in context of looking at chemical (non-inert) interactions in the future.</p>

        <span class="bold">Marco Ranocchiari</span> enquired: Can your model predict whether the reactions go through a CO intermediate and to which extent each reaction occurs in the reactor?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stylianos Kyrimis</span> responded: Yes, the CFD model can predict both the local and the global magnitude of the different pathways. This potential is utilised several times in the paper (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=d0fd00136h" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/d0fd00136h">10.1039/d0fd00136h</a>); it allowed us to estimate the dominant pathways along the reactor, to evaluate the overall MeOH production from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO, and to determine the preferable pathway for CO. In addition, the relative changes in the magnitude and in the equilibrium of the different involved reactions, as a result of changes in the operating procedure (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> flow composition, operating temperature or pressure), can also be determined. This potential is demonstrated in the last section of the paper, where the impact of flow composition on the amount of methanol synthesised from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and from CO is investigated. As such, it was determined that MeOH synthesis predominantly takes places from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation, but direct CO hydrogenation has an important contribution as well (37.5%).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Unni Olsbye</span> questioned: To what extent could your simulations be used to guide catalyst development, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> tuning of the various reaction-specific sites in the catalyst?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stylianos Kyrimis</span> answered: Unfortunately, the CFD model cannot specifically model the molecular interactions with the catalyst and the active sites. These interactions are instead approximated in the flow profile from the kinetic model (KM) and the different terms that it includes. Looking at the MeOH synthesis process, these terms correspond to the adsorption constants of the different species in the active sites, to the chemical equilibrium constants or to the kinetic constants. In addition, the applied KM dictates the interactions between the different species (competitive or non-competitive adsorption). All these terms can be tweaked and optimized in the KM and their impact on the overall process can be evaluated.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As a simple example, a researcher might be interested in improving the rate of CO hydrogenation by adding metallic sites in the Cu/ZnO/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> catalyst. Based on their suggestions, the terms responsible for CO hydrogenation and that are expected to be affected by these metallic sites can be modified in the KM itself. Being used as a parametric study tool, the CFD model can then identify the impact of these modified terms and evaluate whether or not this will be beneficial for the MeOH synthesis process. To conclude, parametric and optimization studies such as these can be achieved, but it is important to ensure that these modifications and tweaks are realistic and well defined. This is a really nice area where experimental investigations can be combined with both DFT and CFD models to accelerate the development process of a catalyst.</p>

        <span class="bold">Peter Styring</span> asked: What are the complexities of combining the CFD approach (which is associated with bulk properties) with chemical modelling? You discuss the combination of CFD with kinetic modelling but are there opportunities to combine with a more atomistic approach? Is there a possibility to include molecular geometry properties with the CFD approach?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stylianos Kyrimis</span> replied: The two models, CFD and DFT, investigate the reaction in two different scales. The CFD is well suited to investigate scales in-between the catalytic particle size (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 100–200 μm as in the paper) and the reactor scale. In this investigation, CFD will provide information regarding the local species concentration, inter and/or intra-particle diffusion transfer and reaction equilibrium. The impact of smaller scales, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the catalytic site coverage and the specific interaction between species and active sites, can only be approximated through volumetric correlations, which might not be representative of the molecular dynamics. In addition, the accuracy of the CFD model is directly related to the kinetic model (KM) considered, which defines the mechanisms and species interactions. Also, the differences between different catalysts (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Cu/Zn/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, Cu/SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Cu/Pd/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) for MeOH synthesis can only be captured through the differences in the incorporated KMs (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> different kinetic constants, adsorption terms, and mechanisms), which will give an incomplete picture of the role of the different active sites.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Looking specifically at the MeOH synthesis process, Park’s KM was defined with the assumption that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> binds on Cu<small><sup>0</sup></small> active sites and CO binds on Cu<small><sup>+</sup></small> sites, signifying a non-competitive adsorption. On the other hand, Nestler’s KM predicts that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO have a competitive adsorption. From the CFD side, this cannot be quantified. Using a DFT model however, it would be possible to specifically quantify the species interactions with the active sites. The DFT can then shed light on topics such as (a) competitive or non-competitive adsorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO, (b) the specific role of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O inhibition – does it de-activate the active site or does it simply occupy H<small><sub>2</sub></small> sites, (c) reverse MeOH decomposition to CO or CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> – does it take place and which sites might be responsible for this, (d) changing catalyst – how does it affect the molecular dynamic mechanisms with the active sites.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">It is clear then that DFT models are the best tools to evaluate the interactions between the species and the active sites. Knowledge such as this will lead to more accurate KMs, which can be then incorporated into the CFD model to investigate the impact of the catalyst on the reactor scale and evaluate its scale-up potential. While the two models investigate completely different scales, their combination will allow a deeper and broader understanding of the different scales involved in chemical reactors.</p>

        <span class="bold">Liane Rossi</span> enquired: How complicated would it be and why was CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> formation not considered under the studied conditions?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stylianos Kyrimis</span> responded: The results of the CFD model are directly dependent on the considered kinetic model (KM). The KM strictly determines the species interactions and the reactant/product concentrations. Looking specifically at the MeOH synthesis, in the experimental data used to determine the kinetic constants and the mechanisms of the KMs, those of Park <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<small><sup>1</sup></small> the production of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> was not reported. Moreover, in the Cu/ZnO/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> catalyst, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> is usually produced only in traces.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">If a different catalyst is used, which would result in a different reactant and product distribution at the outlet, then the KM would have to be updated to include these new species and/or mechanisms. Following this, updating the CFD model itself to include the new KM and the new species is straightforward. Thus, the link between the CFD predictions and the experimental results is the KM itself.</p>
