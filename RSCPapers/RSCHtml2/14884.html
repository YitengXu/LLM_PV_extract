      <span>
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Albo</span> opened the discussion of the paper by Gabriele Centi: Our group recently found the formation of methanol (as the major CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> electroreduction product) at Cu-based surfaces in a similar two-compartment cell configuration.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Actually, the production of methanol at Cu-based electrocatalysts is commonly reported in the literature.<small><sup>2</sup></small> How do you explain (in terms of reaction mechanisms) the formation of acetic acid and only trace amounts of methanol in your liquid phase system?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">1 J. Albo, A. Saez, J. Solla-Gullon, V. Montiel, A. Irabien, <span class="italic">Appl. Catal. B-Environ.</span>, 2015, <span class="bold">176</span>, 709-717.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">2 J. Albo, M. Alvarez-Guerra, P. Castaño, A. Irabien, <span class="italic">Green Chem.</span>, 2015, <span class="bold">17</span>, 2304-2324.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> replied: We believe that due to the type of electrodes we use (gas diffusion electrodes, with the electrocatalyst at close contact with the Nafion membrane), methanol forms but further reacts under these experimental conditions to give acetic acid, with the tentative mechanism reported in the paper.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Albo</span> continued: Could the differences in pH explain the productivity and selectivity variations between the liquid and gas phase CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> electroreduction?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> responded: No, we do not believe it is a problem of pH, but rather of effective concentration of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at the electrocatalyst surface. It is the higher concentration in the gas-phase approach (as it is not limited from the solubility and electrical double layer) which explains the formation of products &gt; C1.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">George Dowson</span> queried: During the description of the proposed mechanism for the formation of acetic acid during your reaction, you suggest that methanol, the product of formaldehyde hydrogenation, is not observed, however the very next section describes how the methanol may essentially be being scavenged by formic acid in the generation of methyl formate. Would it not therefore be more reasonable to conclude that only some of the formaldehyde is converted into acetic acid, with the rest being converted to methanol for methyl formate production?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Additionally, in your paper, the reaction profiles in Fig. 5 suggest that the methyl formate is being consumed during the latter stages of the reaction. As this coincides with the increased formation of acetic acid in both cases, could this indicate that perhaps methyl formate is being consumed to form acetic acid? This reaction is known to occur in the literature, both <span class="italic">via</span> insertion of CO and by rearrangement on the metal surfaces. Finally, is any methyl acetate observed as a product?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> replied: Yes, we believe that methanol and methyl formate further react under our experimental conditions to produce acetic acid. This is one of the possible mechanisms of C-C bond formation during the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reaction, and also may be of interest in terms of application. We are currently analyzing this mechanism in more detail, as it is currently only in a tentative stage. Methyl acetate, on the contrary, is currently only observed in minor amounts. For now, we have focused our attention on the main products.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Csaba Janaky</span> asked: Could you comment on the amount of water transferred with H<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions through the Nafion membrane (electroosmotic water drag)? What is the temperature in the cathode side in the "gas-phase" reactor?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> answered: We feed, in the gas phase configuration, some water vapor together with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. If the electrocatalytic side joins with a photocatalyst, water vapor is also coifed on the other side (for the chemical reported in the paper, a water solution is present on the cathode side). The water feed (on the anode side, together with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) is necessary to maintain a wet Nafion membrane and (likely) has a thin water film over the electrocatalyst (in contact with the Nafion membrane). This helps in enhancing the H<small><sup>+</sup></small> surface transport.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Csaba Janaky</span> enquired: You mention the role of the O-functions of the carbon nanotubes on the electrocatalytic effect towards CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-reduction. I don't know the exact potential of your working electrode, but it is very likely that at the applied cathodic potential, these O-functions are electrochemically reduced. Can you comment on this issue?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> replied: After the oxygen functionalization of CNT (with HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>) there is a thermal annealing to remove less stable oxygen species. The remaining oxygen functionalities are stable in the potential range studied.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gonçalo V. S. M. Carrera</span> commented: Unlike the gas phase cell configuration, when the reaction is carried out in aqueous electrolyte the products are mainly carboxylic acids. I wonder if this difference in behaviour is caused by the stabilization of the carboxylates by water in relative alkaline medium, as this type of stabilization is not possible in a gas phase cell configuration. Of course, other parameters influence the reaction outcome; nevertheless the results in my opinion suggest this explanation. What is your perspective on this issue?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> responded: In our experiments, we use gas diffusion type electrodes, thus the electrocatalyst is at close contact with Nafion both in the liquid and gas phase operations. Under these conditions, the environment close to the catalyst is strongly acidic, which also determines the type of products we observed. However, I agree that under different pH conditions, there may be a different reaction path and type of products.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael North</span> extended the discussion by addressing both Alexander Cowan and Gabriele Centi: How do the electrochemical processes described in each of your papers cope with being turned on and off repeatedly? The ability to cope well under these conditions is essential if they are to be linked with renewable energy.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> answered: This is an interesting point. Our electrochemical system is stable if left in the dark, turned off, and it can be used for several cycles. Indeed most electrochemical systems for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction that I am aware of are able to operate intermittently. In some of the electrodes presented here we actually find that a period of in-operation can be advantageous as it provides a period for the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration at the electrocatalytic sites to increase - we believe that the diffusion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> through the polymer is one of the limiting factors in the experiment.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> replied: The fixed costs of plants in electrochemical processes is typically over 50%, thus continuous operations are necessary to decrease amortization costs. When coupled with renewable energy sources (except for in few cases, such as hydropower), a storage of electrical energy would be necessary. Therefore continuous operations (with adequate energy storage) are requested to minimize the costs and the device should not operate with a fast on/off switch.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ian Ingram</span> addressed Alexander Cowan and Gabriele Centi: High Aspect Ratio Nanoparticles (HARNs), and carbon nanotubes in particular, are the subject of growing concern and regulation because of their toxicity. Konarka, an organic photovoltaics company, went out of business in 2012 partly because their process used large quantities of chlorobenzene and other toxic solvents which proved to be very expensive to handle safely in a production environment, even though they are of very little concern in the research laboratory. Could you both comment on the viability of using carbon nanotubes at scale in an industrial process, given the concerns about their safety?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> responded: We note that CNTs are already in use in several industrial processes, however, this is of course not sufficient evidence for us to propose that they can be safely used on very large scales. A full assessment of the health impacts of CNT manufacture would be required if these materials, developed for fundamental studies, where to be deployed on a large scale. Of relevance to this question is the stability of the polymer/CNT films, which is relatively good. We do not see evidence for CNT loss into the electrolyte which would decrease the potential exposure to CNTs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> answered: Health and safety aspects are clearly critical and definitively we should avoid using toxic solvents or dangerous materials. However, the toxicity of CNTs has often been overestimated, being made on materials which are not those in practical use. By themselves, CNTs are not toxic, for example they are used for drug delivery, but it is the surface radical-chemistry or the adsorption of some organic compounds which may make them problematic. However, in practical materials where high conductivity is necessary, these aspects are not different from those of many other materials used to prepare electrodes.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Csaba Janaky</span> commented: When discussing the scalability of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> electrolysis, one should consider that water electrolysis (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-evolution) was already performed on an industrial scale in the USA in the 1970s. This shows that the technology itself can be scaled, it’s just that more research is needed to find efficient and selective electrocatalysts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> responded: Yes, we agree. There are also large electrochemical processes in operation (besides Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>, adiponitrile, <span class="italic">etc.</span>), even if the technology is somewhat different. However, the key problem of cost should be addressed by increasing the productivity of the electrodes, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> by developing 3D-like electrodes.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Styring</span> addressed Gabriele Centi and Alexander Cowan: I agree with the good point raised by Professor Centi regarding the use of 3D electrodes. Related to scalability, we've talked about the materials but what about the process itself? Cells operate in a laboratory environment, but how do you scale out into tonnes of product?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> replied: The cost of the cell is the critical element in electrocatalytic reactions, and it is therefore necessary to increase productivity per surface of the electrode in order to decrease the costs to the levels required for industrial exploitation. Developing 3D-like electrodes is therefore a priority in order to proceed in this direction. There are problems of scalability, related to homogeneous utilization in large electrodes, but these technological problems are already solved in part for other applications.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> answered: This is an interesting point. I would like to start by noting that even at the laboratory scale significant technical challenges still need to be overcome. Overpotentials for many systems are still larger than many would consider practical, furthermore, obtaining selectivities towards a particular CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction product is challenging, especially when aqueous electrolytes are used. Finally, the role of potential contaminants in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is very rarely even studied and this must be addressed if we are to utilise industrial CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sources. However, work is underway to address these problems and the potential of this approach is enormous. I can think of no insurmountable reason why the sort of materials discussed could not be scaled up to these levels. As discussed, particular attention will need to be paid to the development of 3D high surface areas that are able to maintain suitably high current densities, and additional effort will be required to develop suitable reactor designs. Many very high tonnage electrochemical synthesis processes already exist which does provide confidence that such issues can be addressed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Niklas Meine</span> asked: In industry, safety is one of the major issues, and for this reason we are training people all around the world to guarantee very high safety standards. With respect to electrochemical cells, I wonder how you consider up scaling this process, and how the choice of electrode materials is therefore considered?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> answered: I fully agree that high safety standards are important in the manufacture of electrodes. The electrode we discussed could be manufactured in quite a similar manner to those for fuel cells, by screen printing or similar methods that can also be automated to avoid direct contact of operators with the materials used. There are therefore currently no specific issues over their industrial manufacture.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan Albo</span> remarked: The transport of protons across the membrane may be key in this process. Have you tested other ionic transport membrane materials for your system? I also wonder if you detected CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction products in the anodic compartment (membrane crossover)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> responded: The transport of protons from the two electrodes is the element limiting productivity, and likely the transport from the photocatalyst to the membrane and from the membrane to the electrocatalyst (rather than across the membrane). While transport in the Nafion membrane is well established, the measure of the other two aspects is not easy, but it’s greatly influenced by the reaction conditions (a thin liquid film is likely necessary) as well as the electrode characteristics (hydrophilicity).

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> responded: The cell itself does not have any special requirements for handling and the electrodes are quite robust. One of the problems, however, is that some of the product may remain adsorbed on the electrode, causing deactivation. One of the reasons for operating above r.t. is also to increase the rate of desorption of some of the reaction products from the electrode. Productivity is still the main issue, so we have not made long-term durability tests (beyond the usual lab scale). In terms of scale up there are no main concerns, at least up to 10 x 10 cm size.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> replied: Once formed, the polymer/catalyst/CNT films are quite stable in the dark. The biggest issue regarding stability arises through operation at very high current densities, when excessive gas production can cause film rupture. We are working on new electrode designs in an attempt to alleviate this issue. One of the advantages of the proposed approach is its simplicity. Film fabrication involves preparation of a polymer/catalyst/CNT ink that is either drop-cast or doctor bladed onto the carbon electrode. The ability to simply print the electrodes appears to be quite amenable to scale up.</p>

        <span class="bold">George Dowson</span> continued the general discussion of the paper by Alexander Cowan: Comparing the previous literature performance of catalyst 2 against the performance you see post-immobilisation, there is an extremely large drop in turnover frequency. Since the higher voltage used in the non-immobilised form was partially responsible for this discrepancy, do you think that perhaps there is an economic argument that it is worth increasing the voltage used to achieve these higher frequencies? Concordantly, would it not be worth testing your catalyst system at the same and even higher voltages as used in the previous literature?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> responded: Thank you for your question. One of the reasons for the lower turnover frequency here is that the numbers are based upon the inclusion of all of the Mn centres within the film, of these we know that only a small subset are actually electroactive, so if we quoted the turnover frequency for electroactive centres it would be far higher. You are also correct in noting that we study the system at a different applied potential. We agree that ideally the potential dependence of the turnover frequency would be fully reported in both cases so that the catalysts can be fairly compared, however, in our experiments we find that at higher applied potentials the selectivity towards carbon dioxide decreases and increased hydrogen production occurs. So although higher TOF may be achievable we believe that the system is of less interest at greater applied potentials.</p>

        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> answered: Many studies are indeed carried out using bicarbonate based electrolytes as you suggest. We chose to use a phosphate buffer in this particular study as it simplifies the analysis of the control experiments done in the absence of carbon dioxide. During experiments using bicarbonate/carbonate, the electrolyte is a potential carbon source for reduction, which in practical applications may be advantageous, but for fundamental studies such as this one, complicates the analysis.</p>

        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> replied: Thank you for the question. The potential inactivation of the catalyst through impurities within the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> feedstock is an important issue. For this early stage fundamental study we use a high purity CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> source where water is the primary impurity. Unpublished experiments from our lab indicate that our catalysts are also reasonably tolerant to the presence of oxygen.

As propene is a relatively low-value product, you are making it from a fossil source and your process is thermodynamically limited to low conversions. Is the significant environmental and economic cost of separation justified?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Xian Du</span> answered: The physical separation of propylene from propane is of course challenging, as you point out, but there are indeed well-established (and indeed new) technological processes for such separations. Regarding the price, from alkane to olefin, the price can be nearly doubled as you can see from a quick check online: from the market in China, I can see that propane is currently 3500 CNY/ton while the price for propylene is 6000 CNY/ton. In industrial terms over large volume production, this is a highly significant difference indeed! Many industrial concerns are now aggressively targeting new routes to propene production and this has been a major focus for the King Abdulaziz – Oxford Centre of Excellence in Petrochemicals, which is a part-funder of this research. More robust, higher performance catalysts are now the subject of our own studies. The major aim of our research in this paper is to find a way to minimize the by-product and coke effect, and of course this method can be easily applied over other higher performance catalysts.</p>

Of course, at the very heart of our ‘vision’ is the use of thermal energy in so-called ‘intermediate’ temperature regimes (ca 3–500 °C), where such solar thermal energy is accessible by cheap, robust collectors rather than the high technologies required for say 1000 °C thermal collectors and processes.</p>

        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> asked: The system is essentially the combination of two reversible reactions, propane dehydrogenation and RWGS. How fair are the results with respect to equilibrium? Did you analyse the amount of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> formed to demonstrate that RWGS is shifting the equilibrium in propane dehydrogenation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Xian Du</span> replied: According to our modelled simulation results with Aspen Plus (a software which can calculate the composition of a gas mixture at equilibrium state), at 500 °C, propane will be totally converted, no propylene would be observed in the system, and only methane, CO and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are left. When comparing this result with the calculated results of traditional propane dehydrogenation (without CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which should be around 30% at 500 °C), we can see that the ultimate equilibrium of the system was effectively shifted by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> addition. It's not easy to confirm that H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production can immediately demonstrate the existence of RWGS. H<small><sub>2</sub></small> was generated <span class="italic">via</span> multiple side reactions (such as cracking of propylene), and therefore it'll be tricky to prove the RWGS by only calculating H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production. The ideal and most straightforward way, we believe, is to observe H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O production; so far, the amount of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O is nearly immeasurable, and that's why we will try to scale up the reactor to seek more details on this.</p>

        <span class="bold">Michele Aresta</span> enquired: The use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as the dehydrogenating agent has different properties (thermodynamics, rate, selectivity) with respect to dioxygen. Can you comment on the different behaviours of the oxidizing agents?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Xian Du</span> answered: So far, besides CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, only O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O have been published as oxidising agents in dehydrogenation reactions. O<small><sub>2</sub></small> is effective in improving the propane conversion, but the selectivity is massively reduced due to the enhancement from O<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the complete combustion process. We are seeking a high selectivity of propylene even though the propane conversion would be sacrificed a little bit, so we think O<small><sub>2</sub></small> is simply too strong in this delicate system. H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O has similar usage to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and the generated coke can be more easily removed when using H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O rather than CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, thermodynamically. However, because H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O cannot consume H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation (C<small><sub>3</sub></small>H<small><sub>8</sub></small> = C<small><sub>3</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small> + H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) can hardly be shifted. This is the main reason why we are using CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as the mild oxidising agent, as a potential route to these solar thermal reactions, at these more accessible temperatures, rather than highly energy intensive dry reforming processes.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Xian Du</span> replied: The production of propylene is indeed very low due to the experimental scale in our lab. Actually, as you can see in the paper, we were mainly focusing on how to inhibit by-product generation, and industrialisation, as in most of the schemes presented during this meeting, is about an outlook for the future.

        <span class="bold">Michael North</span> asked: Is CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> the actual oxidant for propane, or is the chromium oxide oxidising the propane and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reoxidising the chromium?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Xian Du</span> answered: First, I don't think that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is the major oxidant for propane immediately, because nearly no conversion of propane can be observed if we don't use any effective catalyst. This result can also prove that the activation and dehydrogenation of propane can only happen on a suitable catalyst surface. Here we believe that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> acts as a sacrificial agent of hydrogen, which is from the dehydrogenation of propane. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can also act as a reoxidising agent for the chromium catalyst. This needs further study.</p>

It is known that the reflections representing strong basic sites in Fe-oxide based materials appear at &gt;500 °C, as illustrated in Fig. 4.

Secondly, the purpose of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPD measurements performed in this section was to study the effect of potassium on the surface basicity of the catalyst, differentiating between weak and strong basic sites. As a matter of fact, the peaks of the three samples centered at ~150 °C are asymmetric indicating that there could be more than one peak. The total area was integrated providing the relative amount of weak basic sites, while the strong basic sites are found at &gt;500 °C.

What is the role of Al in determining the catalyst performances, particularly the resistance to water inhibition?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Moti Herskowitz</span> answered: The addition of potassium shifts the products distribution to higher carbon hydrocarbons. Productivity is lower for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation compared with CO hydrogenation. Our spinel material is a good FT catalyst yielding almost complete conversion of CO. The role of aluminum in the composition of the K/Fe-Al-O spinel is to reduce the reduction-carbidization of iron at the activation step, thus controlling the amount of Fe-carbides. Excess Fe-carbides formed by activation of magnetite spinel in the absence of aluminum leads to deep carburization. As a result, a large amount of graphitic carbon is formed due to oxidation of carbides at the catalyst self-organization stage. This significantly reduces the catalyst surface area.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jeroen Spooren</span> answered: Iron production indeed generates CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Therefore, it is our intention to utilise waste fine grained iron materials, such as waste generated during shaving, milling, and drilling at iron works. The fine fractions of these waste materials cannot be directly used in the iron or steel industry as secondary raw materials due to the creation of hotspots upon introduction in the oven, and even a danger of explosion. In fact, through industrial contacts, we are aware that currently a small fraction of fine grained iron waste is still introduced in furnaces by mixing it with other scrap materials. However, acceptance criteria with regard to the fine grained waste iron are getting more strict, so that blast furnaces and smelters are refusing to take in these waste materials. Therefore, it would be a good solution to recycle such waste in an alternative way and turn it into higher added value products.</p>

        <span class="bold">Koen Michiels</span> responded: The developed hydrothermal process to produce hydrogen gas is based on the oxidation of zero valent iron into magnetite Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>. Experiments performed at different conditions of temperature, initial CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> amount, <span class="italic">etc.</span> – which were performed in the context of the optimisation study of hydrogen production – do not suggest the formation of hematite Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>.

        <span class="bold">Niklas Meine</span> asked: Does the particle size remain small after oxidation so that the iron oxide could be used as a pigment?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Koen Michiels</span> replied: During the hydrothermal production of hydrogen gas particle aggregation occurs. In the case of applying zero valent iron grains of 5 μm as the starting material, aggregates of different sizes were obtained, ranging from 10 μm up to 1000 μm, which was confirmed by laser diffraction particle size analyses. The formation of aggregates probably has a negative effect on the formation of hydrogen gas due to incomplete conversion of metallic iron present in the inner core of the larger grains. We are indeed looking at ways to re-utilise the oxidised iron after reaction as the intention is to valorise the oxidised iron phase. Use as a pigment is indeed one of the routes that we are currently investigating. To our knowledge, Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> is applied as a black pigment in concrete and has a value of about 500-750 € per ton.

Have you tested the direct reaction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> over your catalyst?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Koen Michiels</span> answered: Our experimental results suggest that the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, mainly present as dissolved hydrogen carbonate ions, with H<small><sub>2</sub></small> takes place in the water phase and not in the gas phase. In the paper, we explained our choice to use potassium bicarbonate, KHCO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, as the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> source – in order to make a comparison with other similar one-step hydrothermal methods, which are described in the literature and which also make use of HCO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> ions. In the case of applying Milli-Q water as the reaction medium, we did not perform experiments with gaseous CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. We believe extra parameters, such as the solubility of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, will become important in that case. However, when applying 1 M KOH as the reaction medium, we have performed experiments with gaseous CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. After producing 42 mmol H<small><sub>2</sub></small><span class="italic">via</span> the developed hydrothermal method (step 1), in which 15 mmol of gaseous CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissolves in 40 mL of a 1 M KOH solution to obtain mainly carbonate CO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>2-</sup></small> ions, we investigated different experimental options to convert ‘CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>’ (step 2), as described in the paper. Firstly, the temperature was increased to 280 °C for 24 h. In this case, a carbon conversion amount of approximately 9.7 wt% was observed. One-step hydrothermal methods described in the literature make common use of a hydrogen carbonate salt, such as NaHCO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, which is dissolved in water as the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> source.<small><sup>1</sup></small> In the above described experiment, on the other hand, the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> source is mainly CO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>2−</sup></small> ions. In order to obtain mainly HCO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> ions, the addition of extra CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is necessary after the first step of hydrothermal H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production. However, performing an exactly quantified addition of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> without losing the produced amount of hydrogen gas is complicated due to the high pressure already present in the reactor, as we experimentally encountered. Therefore, we did not include the obtained results in the paper.</p>

        <span class="bold">André Bardow</span> continued the general discussion of the paper by Koen Michiels: Your title indicates that you are producing formic acid but you appear to actually be producing formate. I worry about the separation of the product which is crucial for the energy efficiency of the process but is not discussed in your work. Could you comment on a) your current final product and b) on the separation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Koen Michiels</span> responded: The obtained main product is potassium formate, dissolved in an aqueous solution, therefore, the title might be misleading. In order to tackle any possible confusion, we replaced the word ‘formic acid’ by ‘formate’ in the title and throughout the paper. However, in the case of acidifying the obtained aqueous solution, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> by adding hydrogen chloride, HCl, potassium formate will be converted into formic acid (and potassium chloride). We agree that product separation is an important aspect which should be taken into account when making the process economically feasible. We believe that the optimal process conditions should match the separation procedure. More concretely, for example, the separation of formate/formic acid and water might become more difficult in the case of low formate/formic acid concentrations. Low formate/formic acid concentrations might be obtained in the case of applying a high degree of filling with water. However, a high degree of filling has, according to our research, a positive influence on the amount of carbon conversion due to the increase of the (absolute) amount of dissolved hydrogen gas. Potassium formate and water can be separated by evaporation.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Mixtures of formic acid and water are, due to their similar properties, more difficult to separate. For example, the boiling point of formic acid is 100.7 °C, which implies that performing a distillation process is difficult. However, certain current commercial production processes of formic acid also have to deal with the separation of mixtures of formic acid and water, since these processes make use of large amounts of water in the last (hydrolysis) step. Therefore, separation methods of mixtures of formic acid and (large amounts of) water are already commercially available. A possible solution is described hereafter. Firstly, formic acid and water are separated based on a liquid–liquid extraction method with an organic base. Formic acid will dissolve in the organic base. Eventually, formic acid and the organic base are separated by distillation (http://www.intermediates.basf.com/chemicals/topstory/ideen_tradition).</p>

However, this reduced conversion with particle size may also be attributable to the applied electric field strength being insufficient to initiate an electrical breakdown in the void spaces of the particles <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the reactor is not completely discharging. This phenomena can be demonstrated through the use of Lissajous figures, and measuring the burning voltage at different particle sizes.

The publication of Duan used a much smaller gap (0.6 mm, while we used 4.5 mm). In this smaller gap, for the same applied voltage, the electric field will be higher so the breakdown will be easier, also for smaller bead sizes. That might explain the difference with our results.

As plasma modellers we aim to create accurate models yet we wish to do so within a reasonable timescale. What is a reasonable level of simplification in a typical plasma model, that still accounts for the role of vibrational levels, which reduces the computational time to a reasonable level?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Annemie Bogaerts</span> answered: The answer depends on the type of model (0D chemical kinetics model or multi-dimensional fluid model) and on the type of plasma (DBD <span class="italic">vs.</span> microwave (MW) plasma or gliding arc (GA) discharge). In a 0D chemical kinetics model, the calculation time is not so much of an issue, as the calculations do not take too much time. In this case, it is better to include all vibrational levels of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> that contribute to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the levels of the asymmetric stretch mode), as we did in our model.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small> For the other CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> vibrational modes, as well as for the other molecules present in the plasma (like CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small>), it is sufficient to include only a limited number of vibrational levels, as they play some role, but no major role, in the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">This applies especially to a MW plasma and a GA discharge, but as the calculation time is not such an issue, the same levels can also be included for a DBD (although it is not strictly necessary, as the vibrational kinetics is of minor importance in a DBD).<small><sup>3</sup></small> In a multi-dimensional model (1D, 2D, 3D), calculation time is much more of an issue, and an extensive reaction chemistry, as included in a 0D model, would lead to prohibitively long calculation times. My recommendation then is to reduce the vibrational kinetics scheme as much as possible for a MW and GA (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, by combining some levels), and to neglect it completely for a DBD.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Annemie Bogaerts</span> responded: DBD technology is indeed very suitable for use in plasma catalysis. We just started our work on plasma catalysis, and up to now, we mainly focused on introducing a packing in the plasma reactor, and looking at the enhancement in both CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and energy efficiency, which is mainly attributed to physical effects, like local electric field enhancement, and an increase in the electron energy. Up to now, we used SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and BaTiO<small><sub>3</sub></small> as packing materials. We also did some first experiments for Cu and Ni catalyst coatings on the packings, but the results are still too preliminary.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In fact, the chemical effects of plasma catalysis are not yet well understood. This is partially because the physical and chemical effects are often correlated, as the catalysts are mostly introduced in a packed bed, so it is not easy to distinguish between the two effects. However, Scapinello <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> reported an enhanced selectivity towards the production of carboxylic acids in the case of DRM, when using copper or nickel electrodes instead of stainless steel, which may be attributed to a chemical catalytic effect of these metals, as no packing was involved here.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another reason why the chemical effects of plasma catalysis for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion are not yet fully understood, is that a wide variety of catalyst materials are being explored, including metals (Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, Cu),<small><sup>2</sup></small> zeolites (NaY, NaOH treated Y, HY, Na, NaX, Na-ZSM-5 and Linde type 5A zeolite),<small><sup>3,4</sup></small> La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/g-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/g-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>,<small><sup>5</sup></small> n-type oxide semiconductors (ZnO, CuO), and Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> foams with Ni, Rh or Ca catalysts.<small><sup>6</sup></small> Commercial Ni/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> catalysts, which are also used in thermal catalysis, are currently the most popular catalysts for DRM, but they are not necessarily the most suitable ones under plasma conditions.

This increases the average electron temperature and may compromise energy efficiencies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Annemie Bogaerts</span> responded: This may be true. On the other hand, the polarization of the dielectric beads also gives an enhanced electric field, so that the electrons can more easily become heated, and they have a higher energy, which will facilitate the electron impact ionization and dissociation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, so that the applied power (or energy) is more efficiently used for the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting. Therefore, this can also increase the energy efficiency.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Annemie Bogaerts</span> answered: Most of the atomic oxygen recombines into molecular oxygen.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> responded: Similar to the DBD reactor, the microwave approach could be scaled up by placing larger numbers of reactors in parallel. A more attractive way (in terms of footprint) seems to be scaling up the power in a single reactor.

        <span class="bold">Alexander Navarrete</span> remarked: I assume that the penetration length of microwaves in plasmas cannot be very large (at least at atmospheric pressure), thus in principle electrons near the wall will have more energy than those in the center of the vessel containing the plasma. Therefore, I wonder if constraining the plasma to small diameters (close to or below the penetration length) could provide a more homogeneous (and perhaps efficient) absorption of the energy by the electrons throughout the plasma volume. If that assumption is true, perhaps it could be possible to design systems consisting of several parallel small cylinders, where reactions can be carried out more efficiently?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> responded: Indeed, depending on the plasma density, the penetration depth of the microwaves may become very small and power will be absorbed in the skin. There, the absorption of microwave power, as well as the electron energy, will be the highest. Electron heat conduction to the centre of the discharge will drive the discharge there, so that power transfer to the heavy particles will still occur throughout the discharge. Nevertheless, our working hypothesis, based on the Boltzmann solver results in the paper, is that mean electron energy should be decreased in order to promote vibrational excitation. Promotion of high electron energy regions, by increasing the total skin volume in a multiple discharge channel approach, has the opposite effect.</p>

        <span class="bold">Annemie Bogaerts</span> responded: This might be important, but only at high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions. This is evidenced by the fact that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion tends to saturate at high conversion values (reached at long residence times or high plasma power).

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> asked: What is the mechanism that you have in mind for this plasmonic catalyst? Generally, in plasmonic catalysts you have small metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag) which are able, with visible light, to promote charge separation in a semiconductor. Your case seems different. Could it be possible that there is an effect of local overheating of the metal nanoparticles?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Navarrete</span> responded: Copper based catalysts are known to be active for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation. On the other hand, ZnO has proven to be good at providing dispersion and stability to the copper catalyst (amongst other things). Therefore, Cu/ZnO catalysts are commonly found in research dealing with methanol synthesis (200–250 °C and 20–50 bar usually). In our research, we were looking for local activation of the metallic copper nanoparticles by means of the plasmon phenomena. The related effects reported include an increase of local temperature by the generation of hot electrons, near field effects and scattering. We can therefore use this "heating" to locally activate the reaction instead of heating the complete vessel (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> it is more efficient). Thus, our work looked towards the integration of the plasmonic composite together with the reactor in order to have one single entity acting in response to visual light (not UV in our tests). Therefore, the idea was to carry out the reaction at mild temperatures (possible in a solar collector) and locally activate the copper. Now, we need to really explore the actual mechanisms taking place and know which (if any) is most prominent in order to better design these devices. I therefore propose to characterize our composite with optical and <span class="italic">in situ</span> techniques. We are presently studying the appropriate techniques to achieve this.</p>

        <span class="bold">Thomas Butterworth</span> continued the general discussion of the paper by Gerard van Rooij: If by the addition of earth metals to the microwave plasma you limit electron energy to 1 eV specific energy, does that mean you're theoretically limiting conversion to ~30%? Am I correct?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> answered: This is not correct. The electron energy determines the excitation rates in the plasma but does not relate to the amount of power that is transferred to the feedstock. Whilst adding alkalis to the discharge will likely change the momentum loss rate of the electrons to the heavy particles, this will be compensated by a change in (integrated) electron density so that the total power transferred to the feedstock remains constant. Conversion is connected to specific input power and energy efficiency.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Thomas Butterworth</span> asked: If your maximum conversion is only ever going to be 30% and you're operating at low pressures, isn't this a problem when using microwave plasmas in industry? Do you think that it can ever be an industrially viable technology under these conditions?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> replied: It is evident that the goal of our research is to reach energy efficient operation at higher pressures and higher conversion. In my opinion, conversion and operating pressure are not the prime indicators for success. These are energy efficiency and the total power to which the approach can be scaled. Limited conversion demands separation, and low operating pressure demands high flow speeds. Industrial viability would still heavily depend on the cost of separation and pumping.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Annemie Bogaerts</span> enquired: It is important to improve the energy efficiency in a MW plasma to keep the gas temperature low. What is the best way to accomplish this? Keep the pressure low? Use a high gas flow rate (thus short residence time)? Pulsing the plasma? Or other possibilities?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> responded: The reasoning in our paper is that presently the effect of a high average electron energy driving the direct dissociative excitation processes is dominating. This efficiently heats the heavy particles and subsequently quenches any vibrational excitation. Gas flow rate (residence time) and pressure are connected, and were varied in the experiments reported in our paper. It strongly affected central gas temperatures but was less effective in achieving strong non-equilibrium conditions. Nevertheless, record energy efficiencies reported in the literature invoked supersonic flows, a regime far beyond the parameter space covered in the present paper. Pulsing of the plasma is surely an interesting option to investigate, although this would periodically increase electron energy even further (as has been shown in your papers on dielectric barrier discharges).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Foote</span> asked: Is the thermal region in the plasma causing a very high degree of ionisation which, in turn, is causing dissociative recombination to be dominant over vibrational excitation, which is not desired for high energy efficiencies?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> replied: This is indeed what we believe is happening.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Foote</span> remarked: Do you have any idea of the electron density and temperature in the thermal region of the plasma? Is there a very high electron density in the thermal region due to a high degree of ionisation?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> responded: Estimates of the electron temperature are given in the paper on the basis of Boltzmann solver calculations. Estimates of the density could be based on a simple power balance: the product of plasma volume, electron density, gas density and electron energy loss rate should match the input power. These are very sensitive to assumptions on radial profiles. Simply assuming a plasma volume of let's say ~5×10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> m<small><sup>3</sup></small> for the measured central neutral densities of ~10<small><sup>23</sup></small> m<small><sup>−3</sup></small> would give an electron density of ~5×10<small><sup>18</sup></small> m<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. Without gas heating, the electron density would have been 1–2 orders of magnitude lower.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">James Comerford</span> remarked: In your paper you refer to the term ‘input energy', could you please define what you mean by this. My understanding is that with traditional plasma apparatus, the input energy from a generator is very different to the plasma energy. As such, the difference between the two can have a substantial effect on energy efficiency calculations.</p>
      
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> responded: The paper refers to the terms ‘input power’ and (dividing input power by gas flux) ‘specific input energy’. In situations where matching circuits are used between the power generator and plasma reactor, it is often difficult to determine the input power. In our microwave experiment this is relatively straight forward. We measure the power that is launched by the microwave source as well as the power that is reflected back from the plasma reactor and absorbed in the water load. In both cases, additional power losses will decrease performance, and the latter will thus not be overestimated.</p>

        <span class="bold">Michele Aresta</span> asked: The formation of Group 1 cations may also cause interactions with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and, depending on the cation, a possible change of geometry (towards a bent molecule). Have you observed any effects due to such interactions?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> answered: We have not observed any such interactions. I expect that the interaction between the cations and the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> will mainly have an effect on the ionization life time and therefore on the plasma properties, which is the subject of our present research. Given the low amounts of cations (well below 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small>) the effect on vibrational excitation dynamics will be low.</p>

        <span class="bold">Thomas Butterworth</span> communicated: How do you intend to incorporate alkali metal ions in the plasma?

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gerard van Rooij</span> communicated in reply: In our current approaches we use commercially available alkali metal dispensers. These allow controlled rates of evaporation of the metal. The exact amount and distribution of alkali atoms in the discharge is in the first instance not important. There simply should be sufficient alkali atoms present to provide the ionization. In other words, the quoted 0.01% sodium content is the minimum amount to allow an ionization degree of 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small>. In this way, the plasma properties are tuned by the ionization energy of the alkali atom and not by the amount of alkali.</p>

        <span class="bold">Richard Heyn</span> addressed all the speakers: I understand very well that we are still at the early stages of research in the field, but I would like to be a bit provocative and ask for a frank assessment and future vision of these "alternative" techniques for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction: electrochemistry, photochemistry, and plasma. What are the main challenges or limitations? Which one(s) might be considered the most promising at this stage? Which one(s) have the best chance of eventually achieving some sort of commercial realization?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Alexander Cowan</span> responded: This is a challenging question. I have experience of electrochemical and photochemical systems but it would not be appropriate for me to comment on how these compare to plasma techniques due to a lack of knowledge. Photochemical approaches are potentially very low cost, doing away with the need for separate PV panels, electrolysers and all of the costs associated with the wiring of these together, hence in my opinion the long term photochemical approaches are highly attractive. However, direct photochemical carbon dioxide reduction is currently inefficient. Typically, solar to fuel conversion efficiencies are below 1% and advances in catalyst design will be necessary in the forthcoming years. In the shorter term, electrochemical approaches offer a more viable solution. Utilising available PV panels and state of the art electrodes, other research groups have managed to convert up to 7% of the incident solar energy in the form of a carbon based fuel produced <span class="italic">via</span> carbon dioxide reduction. Further advances in the development of new low cost electrocatalysts are likely to make these systems more attractive from an economic viewpoint as well.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> answered: For plasma, the real challenge is to have a different approach in the integration with the catalyst, because the catalyst should be able to work with excited gas phase species. There are still very limited attempts in this direction, but some new ideas are emerging. It is mainly a question where today’s researchers have not really addressed the key problems.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, for the photochemical approach, I believe that the problem is still not understood well. Again, it is still not clearly defined exactly what the essence of the problem is. On the other hand, electrocatalysis is somewhat more advanced, and likely within a few years (let me say 5), we will see the first commercially relevant applications, although this depends on the effective R&amp;D efforts in this direction.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michele Aresta</span> continued: Plasma technology is quite old, maybe 40 years or so. Previously, in the 1970's and 1980's, discharge using CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> or CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> have already been investigated. Today, the technology is more advanced, but the fundamentals have been known for a long time. Electrochemical reduction of water to produce hydrogen for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction is on a commercial scale. It is a matter of cost of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> with respect to reforming. Photoreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is in its growth phase and catalysts are designed and show interesting efficiencies of a few units %. Carboxylation is a new baby. We need to discover the band gap of semiconductors to match the potential of the reactions, depending on the substrate. Much work is still necessary, so let’s wait until it grows up. The common denominator is that all technologies may use perennial primary energies – such as solar, wind or geothermal energies for producing electricity. Fossil carbon is saved anyway. I am an optimist, I was optimistic in 1975 when we discovered the first nickel complex of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and said that it opened the way to the utilization of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and now my dream has come true.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Annemie Bogaerts</span> responded: I cannot really comment on electrochemistry and photochemistry, as I am not a specialist, but I can comment on the challenges and limitations of plasma. In my opinion, the most important challenges are to improve the energy efficiency and the selectivity towards specific chemicals.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The energy efficiency strongly depends on the type of plasma. The highest energy efficiency up to now was already reported in 1983 for a microwave (MW) plasma, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, up to 90%, but this was at very specific conditions; <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, supersonic gas flow and reduced pressure (~100–200 Torr), and a pressure rise to atmospheric pressure, which would be desirable for industry, yields a drop in energy efficiency to 40%. Moreover, this high value of 90% has never been reproduced since then. The highest energy efficiency for a MW plasma reported recently was 55%, but again at a reduced pressure and supersonic flow. A GA plasma also exhibits a high energy efficiency, even at atmospheric pressure, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, around 43% for a conversion of 18% in the case of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> splitting, and even around 60% for a conversion of 8–16%, for DRM. The energy efficiency of a DBD is more limited, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, up to 10% for a conversion of 30% for a DBD without packing, but by inserting a (dielectric) packing in a so-called packed bed DBD reactor, the energy efficiency can be improved. An improvement up to a factor of 12 was indeed demonstrated already, but this was for other applications (air purification) while for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion only improvements up to a factor of 2 were reported recently. However, the advantages of a DBD are that it also operates at atmospheric pressure, and has a very simple design, which is beneficial for up scaling, as demonstrated many years ago for the large scale production of ozone, and therefore it also has potential for industrial applications.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The other challenge, as mentioned above, is the selective production of specific chemicals. In my opinion, this is still a larger challenge. Up to now, mostly syngas is formed, and the direct production of oxygenates (methanol, formic acid, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) is very limited. The reason for this is that a variety of reactive plasma species is formed, but not in a selective way. To improve the selectivity towards specific value-added compounds, we need to combine the plasma with a catalyst, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, so-called plasma catalysis. The latter is most easy to realize with a (packed bed) DBD reactor, as often shown already for air pollution control, and to a limited extent for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion. However, currently the underlying mechanisms of plasma catalysis are not yet fully understood, and it is not yet known which catalysts are most suitable for this purpose. Clearly more research is needed here.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Eric Fraga</span> commented: The question of which technology is <span class="italic">best</span> may not be the right question. Often, the premise of the existence of a best solution is based purely on economics and often with an assessment of the local properties of the technology. However, design choices are often multi-criteria and include more than just economics. For instance, criteria may include environmental impacts, societal perception and policy directions. It is also necessary to consider the full life cycle, as much as one can, so that the impact of aspects of pretreatment or precursor preparations and also waste disposal on all the various criteria are taken into account.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michele Aresta</span> responded: Economics is not a factor that may be used for defining the "best" technology in the case of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. We are targeting CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission reduction and therefore the quality of a process must be judged on the basis of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction parameters: Carbon Utilization Fraction (CUF), Carbon Footprint (CF), Waste production (E factor), Energy Utilization Fraction (EUF). Moreover, if we discuss in terms of economics the question will be "who has to pay ": consumers or producers? This is not a selective criterion in terms of environmental benefit. If the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction is targeted, then a more complex frame derives with implications of collective and individual responsibilities with respect to an efficient use of resources.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> commented: Up to now, we have mainly worked on selectivity, putting little attention on the energy point of view – from this point of view we learn that if you just have thermal energy it's not selective – we need to find alternative solutions (like electrocatalysis, plasma catalysis, photochemistry) to supply energy selectively, but we still do not know how to create a selective catalytic path with the excited species created by these approaches. This is the challenge we face.</p>

This technology allows more efficient energy and mass transfer and can be scaled up by "parallelization".

        <span class="bold">Derek Harris</span> enquired: I would like to ask whether most of the techniques we are talking about are on real situations or ones that you have recreated in the lab?

It may take some time before we are able to achieve good results in real situations, particularly when chemicals are prepared in distilled water.</p>

The plasma work aims to produce solar fuels by sustainable electricity to aid in peak shaving, by addressing intermittency issues. By enabling long term electrical energy storage and energy sector integration, it aids in reaching large scale sustainable energy deployment.

        <span class="bold">Peter Styring</span> noted: An interesting point has been raised regarding the technological readiness of CDU technologies, and why most are presented at the fundamental stage. This is because we are looking to develop these new technologies and the level to date is appropriate for laboratory studies. You have to start from somewhere, on the fundamentals. You have to start with pure CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, then add impurities such as nitrogen, before going on to more simulated glue gases with more impurities. Only when this laboratory screening has been carried out can you go into the field to work on real systems. Going in to the field from the start is very difficult and expensive.</p>

        <span class="bold">Gabriele Centi</span> said: We are still at the stage of exploring the many possibilities which exist, but care should be taken in extrapolating the actual growth of knowledge as it is still too far from an industrial point of view. 60 years ago, the situation was similar with the transition from acetylene to olefins. The transition was extremely fast, and companies not rapidly prepared become out of business. In a PV cell, the International Energy Agency predicted in around 2000 that commercial introduction of these cells in the market would be negligible, 1–2% in 2020, however we are already above 10%. There is not a linear, but an exponential growth, when conditions (including the knowledge necessary) are ready. The same may be applied for the field of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and I would predict that within a few short years there will be quite an explosion of commercial uses, even if we are still not in the position now to indicate exactly which technology will be a priority. However, I believe that electrocatalysis is one of these technologies, which is at the foundation of the future of sustainable energy/chemical production.</p>
