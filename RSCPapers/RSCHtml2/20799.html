This has the benefits of both time and cost saving. There has been a drop in the number of papers reporting methods for the analysis of fuels. This may be a function of the drop in oil prices leading to reduced finance for research. However, the determination of S is one of the hot topics in this sample type. This is possibly a consequence of companies attempting to meet the increasingly strict regulations on S emissions. Analytical methodology, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LA-ICP-MS, LIBS or XRF, which produces minimal damage to the samples is still increasingly popular. This is especially true for historical or archaeological sample types, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> paintings, pottery and old documents; but is also applicable to forensic materials. Often, with these sample types, the analytical data are then treated using chemometrics packages so that provenance may be determined or patterns detected. Similar methodology was used for the identification of different plastics types, facilitating sorting and re-cycling. The analysis of nanoparticles is an increasingly popular subject area. Simple introduction of samples containing nanoparticles through a standard nebuliser/spray chamber sample introduction system is often complicated by the particles agglomerating. This leads to under-estimations of the concentrations present. Single particle analysis has continued to be a popular research area with real samples now being extracted and analysed rather than standard solutions. Similarly, field flow fractionation coupled with ICP spectrometry (sometimes also in conjunction with single particle analysis) has also been used to characterize nano-particulates and to distinguish between particulate and ionic species.</p></div><hr/>

      <span>Within this review period, a large number of papers have been published in which <span class="italic">established spectroscopic techniques have been used to provide a comprehensive analysis</span> of complex metal samples. Many of these are critical to the development of advanced products and their processes and generally require a multiple spectroscopic approach to deliver the required level of characterization. Noteworthy contributions in this area are listed in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, and as a general observation, most multiple method approaches rely on MS detection within the suite of techniques to provide the required selectivity and sensitivity.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">Key papers, demonstrating significant contribution to the advancement of metals analysis, are highlighted in this review to profile state-of-the-art. However, the high proportion of papers analysing solid samples influences the scope of this review along with the growing interest in LIBS applications which is by far the most popular topic in this review period.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect527"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>
          <span class="italic">Efforts to improve the detection sensitivity of laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) continue on many fronts, rooted in the fundamental aspects of the laser metal interaction</span>. Hao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> demonstrated the use of a ring magnet to improve the sensitivity of LIBS analysis for V and Mn. The authors reported 3 sigma detection limits of 41 ppm for V (437.92 nm) and 56 ppm for Mn (403.08 nm) in ambient conditions which improved to 11 ppm and 30 ppm, respectively, using the ring magnet. Measurements showed an increase in both plasma temperature and electron density which was attributed to spatial and magnetic confinement of the plasma.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">alternative approach to improving plasma temperatures, with dual pulse lasers</span>, has been used for several years. Pedarnig <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> used an orthogonal double pulse configuration to examine the effect of laser parameters on sensitivity. In this study, Cl atoms were chosen because of their high excitation energies of 9.2 eV and 10.4 eV at the emission wavelengths of 134.72 nm and 837.59 nm, respectively. Detection of Cl on Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> (powder) and Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> (ceramic), provided the complex ferrous matrix for a realistic assessment of the effect of laser parameters on the sensitivity in ferrous metals. The authors reported that the inter-pulse delay between the ablation pulse and the excitation pulse, and the wavelength of the latter were the most critical factors affecting detection sensitivity. Laser excitation at 193 nm showed significant emissions from Cl atoms indicating elevated plasma temperatures, not seen using IR excitation at 1064 nm. Inter-pulse delays of 1 μs were required with the UV excitation; detection was configured to accommodate rapidly decaying Cl emissions. In a direct comparison between single and dual pulse operation, the authors concluded that orthogonal dual pulse operation provided higher detection sensitivity because of the higher signal to background ratio.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">The fundamental principles of LIBS are aligned with application to standoff analysis</span> and therefore uniquely suitable for in-process applications. In steel production, the detection of P at low concentrations is of considerable importance but presents detection difficulties as a UV emitting element. Notable work by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> explored the use of the P atomic emission line at 214.91 nm: a longer wavelength to the line more commonly used. The P could be detected down to 12 ppm in pig iron and 9 ppm in low alloy steels. Achieving this level of detection in air required careful optimization of the time gating to minimize interference from iron and copper. Element detection at UV wavelengths in air provides an insight into what may be achieved in a production environment with a level of engineering not complicated by gas atmosphere control. This concept was also covered by Jiang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> covering C and S: two additional elements that emit in the UV region and that are critical to steel production. A range of laser and spectrometric parameters affecting the analytical sensitivity was assessed. Optimization was based on collinear, IR, double-pulsed configuration using a 200 mJ ablation with a 15 ns pulse length followed by a 665 mJ pulse at a 6 ns pulse length. The authors claimed single figure ppm levels of detection for these elements. Both Li <span class="italic">et al.</span> and Jiang <span class="italic">et al.</span> have demonstrated low detection limits for the difficult elements important in steelmaking and achieved this under ambient conditions.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Sturm <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> demonstrated <span class="italic">rapid analysis of molten slag using LIBS, directly from the steelmaking process</span>. Applying LIBS directly to slag in the ‘slag-pot’, which receives molten slag directly from the ladle, presented a pragmatic approach which operated on a 24 hour basis for 3 months within the steelmaking production process. Good agreement with the standard XRF analysis was reported for the critical oxides: CaO, SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MgO and Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> including total Fe losses.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Considerable engineering difficulties are associated with analytical instruments operating in this harsh environment. However, Aula <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> presented a novel approach based on the atomic emission data produced from the electrical arc discharge of arc furnace operation. The authors reported that emission data could be remotely measured, which represented the slag composition changing as part of the refining process. Spectroscopic analysis of the plasma conditions was derived from the Ca atom line, which indicated that an outer plasma temperature was below 7000 K. The authors proposed this region as the most sensitive for quantitative measurements.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Xu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> proposed <span class="italic">a novel approach</span> to improve LIBS classification accuracy during the identification of the quality grades in steel bars. The authors proposed the use of model population analysis as a framework for selecting identifying variables form LIBS generated spectra. Within the model population analysis framework, accuracy influence analysis was used to identify and quantify the elements which are critical grade identifiers. The authors claimed this approach produced a robust model within the combined support vector machine network to identify nine different grades of steel bars.

Mineral raw materials used in primary metals production offers an opportunity to identify raw materials provenance in the final product for supplier identification.

The gas discharge pressure required to maintain the voltage and the current constant, is lower than for Cu due to the high secondary electron emission of Al and Mg. At lower gas pressures, the blue shift effect was reported to be more pronounced. This matrix effect was attributed to the Doppler effect in electronegative elements and the authors proposed that this effect is an important factor to consider for other elements. Accommodating this effect and internally referencing the oxygen to the matrix metal emission was proposed as a method of developing matrix specific calibrations to improve quantitative accuracy.

By using the gap between the excitation energies of the gas and particle phases a new low-intensity LIBS technique was developed to distinguish the Na in the particle phase from that in the gas phase. The residence time, indicating Na release from particle and gas phases, was determined. By using a theoretical analysis, the Na release time approximately coincides with the characteristic pyrolysis time of the lignite. This work may provide a basis for exploring the formation mechanism of sub-micron fine particulates during coal combustion. The technique of LIBS was also employed by Zheng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> to analyse coal particles directly in a descending flow.

          <p class="otherpara">A method for the <span class="italic">decomposition of biodiesel samples for elemental analysis using ICP-OES</span> was described by Packer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> Their method used a high pressure asher to digest the samples. Their aim was to remove the need to analyse these samples directly to avoid instrument interferences, carbon build up and exposure of laboratory personnel to harmful solvents. Optimum digestion conditions were 1.5 g of biodiesel, with HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>, at a temperature of 300 °C and a pressure of 435 psi.

          <p class="otherpara">Two <span class="italic">review papers for biofuel analysis</span> were of note this year. The first by Porizka <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> containing 137 references, discussed algal biomass analysis using laser-based analytical techniques. Algal biomass has recently found many potential applications in various fields of interest. Its utilization has been advantageous in the fields of bioremediation, biofuel production and the food industry. This paper reviews recent developments in the analysis of algal biomass with the main focus on LIBS, Raman spectroscopy and LA-ICP techniques. The advantages of the selected laser-based analytical techniques were presented and their fields of use discussed in detail. The other review by Sanchez <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> containing 212 references, addressed metal and metalloid determination in biodiesel and bioethanol. Biofuel quality control involves the determination of metal and metalloid content. These species play a very important role because they can modify the efficiency of biofuel production as well as the stability of these products. Some metals are toxic and generate environmental concerns whereas others are used as additives. Normally products such as biodiesel and bioethanol are mixed with conventional fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline. Metals can come from the raw product as well as from the production and storage process and even from the added fuels. The determination of the final metal and metalloid concentrations in biofuels is a challenging subject as their concentrations are usually low and sensitive techniques are required. Several approaches have been evaluated to carry out this kind of analysis. The most often employed techniques are ICP-OES and ICP-MS, together with atomic absorption methods. The different procedures applied were discussed in the review emphasizing the most widely used ones.</p>

        <span>The <span class="italic">application of non-invasive spectroscopic techniques in the cultural heritage domain</span> continues to provide valuable data, particularly in the conservation and restoration fields. Most of the papers are related to specific applications generally aimed at obtaining chemical characterization of pigments and dyes and understanding degradation processes altering the works of arts as well as identification of the provenance of cultural objects. The integrated approach of micro-techniques, μ-XRF, μ-X-ray absorption near-edge structure (μ-XANES), μ-XRD and the use of both atomic and molecular spectrometry is well established in these fields.</span>

          <span>Colour degradation in paintworks is a complex subject which has recently attracted scientists working with spectroscopic and/or microscopy techniques. Synchrotron radiation (SR)-based X-ray microprobe techniques such as μ-XRF and XANES, have been successfully employed over the last decade for the study of degradation of pigments.

Experimental results from full spectra-XANES imaging data obtained at the Cr K-edge using the Maia X-ray detector and corresponding μ-XRF mapping and single point μ-XANES results were compared with those obtained using conventional silicon drift detectors.

          <span>
            <span class="italic">Detection of explosives compounds</span> continues to be an interesting topic. Stand-off LIBS is a valuable detection technique for remote analysis of explosives because it is desirable for the analyst to remain at safe distance from the material. Numerous studies carried out over the last few years demonstrated the ability of LIBS to detect and discriminate residues explosives on multiple substrates from a distance of many meters. An informative review of laser-based techniques for standoff detection of threat agents was presented by Johnson <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> with 85 cited references. For each method the technique was briefly outlined as well as the current level of capability.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Gaona <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> presented a novel strategy for <span class="italic">standoff recognition of explosive fingerprints</span> on solid surfaces using a supervised learning method and LIBS. In standoff instruments, the distance between the target and the sensing platform plays an important role in determining the signal intensity and the noise of the information collected. The emission response from the investigated substance it is governed by external conditions. The authors used, for the first time, an algorithm based on the adaptation of a supervised classification model to changing experimental situations, handling the inherently multifactorial nature of the standoff LIBS analytical response. Residues of ordinary materials (olive oil, fuel oil, motor oils, gasoline, car wax and hand cream) hardly caused confusion in alerting the presence of an explosive (DNT, TNT, RDX or PETN) when tested from arrange of 30 to 50 m and with laser irradiance changing between 8.2 and 1.3 GW cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. The authors acknowledged that a universal strategy coping with all possible changes (light propagation through the atmosphere, weather conditions, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) is difficult to accomplish and reflected on future developments to improve the consistency of the strategy to significant changes in environmental conditions. The technique's capabilities are being enhanced significantly by work such as this. Laser plasmas are very reactive chemical environments because of their high electron density and elevated ionic temperatures. Atoms, molecules, ions and electrons interact and therefore interpretation of molecular emission spectra is difficult, in particular for species containing C, N, O or H. Delgado <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> carried out experiments to address the question of whether the LIBS spectrum mimics the structure of the molecule or the molecular information obtained corresponds to recombination of atoms and molecular fragments with ambient constituents. The influence of the surrounding atmosphere, from gas type (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, N<small><sub>2</sub></small>) to pressure (from atmospheric to 10<small><sup>−5</sup></small> mbar) on the spectra of energetic nitro-compounds (TNT and PETN) was evaluated with simultaneous detection at high vacuum of both emission and mass spectra originated from the same laser event. The authors proposed probable fragmentation pathways for these compounds, both containing NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> groups in their structure as a native source of N. The explosive TNT is aromatic and therefore has carbon–carbon double bonds. The suggested routes were supported by LIBS measurements where many non-emitting, reactive species present in the plasma were identified. Pressure was identified as being a critical factor affecting the dynamics of the plasma. In a nitrogen atmosphere, C<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission was strongly related to molecular structure whereas CN was mostly produced by chemical reactions.

          <span>The importance of quantitative analysis of metallic impurities in pharmaceutical final products and in active pharmaceutical impurities (API) is driven by strict regulatory requirements. Guidelines of the United States Pharmacopeia, European Pharmacopeia and European Medicines Agency regulating elemental impurities for metal residues in pharmaceuticals are updated regularly. A novel methodology based <span class="italic">on flow injection analysis and ICP-quadrupole (Q)MS</span> was developed by Fischer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> for the determination of Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Cr, Mo, V, Ni, Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn in drug products. A commercially available fast sample throughput flow injection device (SC-FAST system) was used for sample introduction, enabling 90 samples per h to be analysed. The main advantages of this methodology compared with the acquisition of continuous signals are high sample throughput, shorter analysis time and low sample consumption (around 50 μL). Strict regulatory demands on LOD, precision and accuracy were satisfied.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Direct elemental determination of inorganic contaminants in APIs using LA-ICP-MS presents an analytical challenge, mainly due to lack of matrix matched reference materials for calibration and validation purposes. Rudovica <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> developed <span class="italic">laboratory made matrix calibration standards</span> for quantification of six elements (Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb) in the API arbidol tablets using LA-ICP-MS. Various operating conditions of the laser ablation system such as laser radiation energy, pulse rate and spot size were optimized and the homogeneity of the elemental distribution in the standards evaluated. Mass concentration in the standards was in the range 1 to 150 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Calibration graphs with regression coefficients better than 0.997 were achieved. The authors reflected on the fact that further evaluation of long-term stability of prepared standards would be required.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The control of residual genotoxic impurities is a critical factor in the development of APIs. Genotoxic impurities form a special case that poses significant risk, even at low concentration, because they may be mutagenic and are therefore potentially damaging to DNA. As a result they can lead to mutations or cause cancer. Analysis of genotoxic impurities can be very challenging because they must be controlled at levels significantly lower than 0.01–0.03%. Therefore sensitive and selective methods for these impurities at sub-ppm levels are required. Some significant analytical developments in this field are reviewed, including two papers which reported novel methods for trace-level determination of genotoxic impurities in APIs by <span class="italic">LC-ICP-MS employing iodo-derivatization</span>. Harigaya <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> presented a novel sensitive determination of 4-chloro-1-butanol, a genotoxic alkylating agent. This compound originates from tetrahydrofuran, which is frequently used as a solvent in API synthesis, by reaction with hydrofluoric acid. When using tetrahydrofuran and HCl in API synthesis, residual amounts of 4-chloro-1-butanol must be monitored. The authors exploited the selectivity and sensitivity of two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC) hyphenated with of ICP-MS for impurity determination by derivatization with 3-iodobenzoyl chloride. The linearity of the method was observed in the range from 0.5 to 50 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of API. The LOD and LOQ were 0.2 and 0.5 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively, values well above the thresholds specified in the guidelines. In a later <span class="italic">study</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> the same investigation group expanded the range of options of iodo-derivatization for the determination of phenylhydrazine in antipyrine using the same technique and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoyl chloride as a derivatization reagent. Five different commercially available lots of antipyrine were analysed. Phenylhydrazine results were below the LOD (0.06 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) in all the lots.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Platinum Group Metals (PGM) are used widely as catalysts in the synthesis of APIs but may represent a health risk if they remain in the target product. According to the United States Pharmacopeia convention (USP), the concentration limit for Pd, Pt and Rh has been set at 10 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in APIs. The determination of PGM at low levels (μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) is an analytical challenge because of the difficulty in bringing them in solution and occurrence of interferences when using spectroscopic techniques for analysis. Resano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit83"><sup><span class="sup_ref">83</span></sup></a> investigated the potential of high-resolution continuum source (CS)-GFAAS for direct determination of Pd, Pt and Rh in two different types of samples: used automobile catalysts and APIs. The authors observed that the matrix in the API, consisting of organic compounds, was removed efficiently during the pyrolysis step. Stop flow conditions were used during atomization. Both Pt and Rh were monitored simultaneously; using 244.006 nm and 244.034 nm for Pt and Rh, respectively while for Pd another line was selected (360.955 nm). No modifier was added since the signals obtained were unimodal and very well defined. Limits of detection were calculated to be 0.08 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Pd, 0.15 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Pt and 0.10 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Rh for a mass of 5 mg, enabling the quantification of PGM at the limits set by regulations. This work presents an important step forward in PGM determination overcoming spectral interferences encountered by spectroscopic techniques such as ICP-OES.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A digestion method using <span class="italic">a single reaction chamber (SRC) microwave system</span> for determination of elemental impurities in API in compliance with USP requirements was evaluated by Muller <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84</span></sup></a> The system allowed temperatures and pressures up to 300 °C and 199 bar respectively. High digestion efficiency of up to 500 mg of sample with a carbon content in the digest lower than 250 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained. Digestion of API was also performed using conventional high-pressure microwave-assisted digestion system to compare efficiencies. The determination of elements was carried out using ICP-MS in standard mode and dynamic reaction cell (DRC) mode with ammonia as reaction gas in order to solve polyatomic ion interferences on <small><sup>51</sup></small>V, <small><sup>52</sup></small>Cr, <small><sup>53</sup></small>Cr, <small><sup>63</sup></small>Cu and <small><sup>65</sup></small>Cu. The determination of As and Hg was undertaken using a homemade flow injection chemical vapour generation (FI-CVG) unit coupled with ICP-MS. Using this procedure masses of 500 mg were decomposed with 6 mL of concentrated nitric acid for As, Ad, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb and V determination. A mass of 250 mg was decomposed with 4.5 mL of concentrated nitric acid and 1.5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid for determination of Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru. The procedure was not suitable for Os determination due to memory effects. The method was validated in accordance to USP requirements. Spike recoveries were in the range of 94% to 108% except for Os where recoveries higher than 106% were obtained. Precision was evaluated using repeatability and intermediate precision studies ranging from 2.0 to 6.5%. Limits of quantification were calculated using 500 mg or 250 mg of sample and a final volume of 25 mL and values obtained were in agreement with USP requirements.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">The separation of four cobalamins (hydroxo-; adenosyl-; cyano-; and methylcobalamin) was described by Bednarik <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> by coupling thin layer chromatography (TLC) to diode laser thermal vaporization (DLTV) ICP-MS as an alternative to HPLC or capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to ICP-MS. The technique of DLTV was used by the same authors in previous studies as a sensitive and low cost technique of sub-microliter dried droplet analysis. The technique uses a 808 nm continuous wave diode laser to induce pyrolysis of the cellulose stationary phase on TLC sheets overprinted with black ink. The aerosol generated is carried into the ICP. The entire TLC lanes were then analysed using DLTV in a 17 cm long glass tubular cell. Laser positioning and focus as well as speed of the line scan were optimized to provide the maximum integrated signal to noise ratio for <small><sup>59</sup></small>Co. The 8 cm long lanes were scanned in ∼35 s. Under optimized conditions, a LOD of 2 pg for each analysed cobalamine sample and 15% repeatability were reported. The different cobalamines were found to provide different analytical responses; therefore species-matched standards were used for calibration. The method was applied to quantitative determination of cobalamines present in a vitamin supplement, in which only cyanocobalamin (as opposed to the cyano-, hydroxyl- or methyl-analogues) was detected at a concentration of 130 ± 12 μg. This was in excellent agreement with results from a more traditional analysis method.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">High levels of Cr were discovered in edible gelatin capsules used in pharmaceutical products in China.

A relatively low temperature (&lt;350 K) and high electron number density (10<small><sup>14</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>) plasma could be generated in helium and argon. The authors evaluated direct solid sample analysis capabilities of the plasma jet analysing commercial paracetamol tablets (acetaminophen), Claritin tablets (loratadine 10 mg) and aspirin tablets (acetylsalicylic acid 325 mg). The plasma source was coupled to a high-resolution molecular mass spectrometer (Exactive with Orbitrap mass analyser). The three samples were analysed without sample pre-treatment. Quantitative analyses of vaporized solution samples were also examined.

The influence of operational parameters such as discharge current and gas flow rates on the P signal were investigated. To compare the analytical ability of the micro-plasma, a microwave plasma was introduced. From a security point of view, a nerve agent stimulant, triethylphosphate was used and the detection limit was 5 ppm by volume.

          <p class="otherpara">Direct determination of trace elements in organic solvents by ICP poses a challenge because of problems associated with carbon loading of the ICP including plasma instability and spectral interferences by carbon and soot formation on the torch or injector.

The authors exploited the removal of carbon prior to introduction into the ICP by burning the sample in the presence of oxygen. A commercial carbon analyser was placed between the aerosol exit of the spray chamber and the torch of the ICP-OES. The sample aerosol was mixed with additional argon and oxygen in the carbon analyser oven where the combustion took place at 1050 °C effectively burning all carbon to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The flow of argon and oxygen added to the aerosol as well as combustion conditions were optimized. The authors reflected on possibilities for improvement when the proposed method was applied to specific samples. Even if the ICP was stable, the whole analytical performed was degraded when compared with the introduction of aqueous samples, mainly because of the presence of 1% oxygen in the gas stream and analyte-specific losses in the combustion and desolvation system. Another problem encountered was the instability of peristaltic pump tubes towards various organic solvents. However, the proposed method presented advantages over other approaches. These included stable operation of the ICP even when introducing highly volatile samples that would normally extinguish the plasma. Analyte signals in halogenated solvents were higher than in non-halogenated ones.

          <span>Once again the bulk of relevant papers in this section of the review relate to the <span class="italic">forensic analysis of gunshot residue (GSR)</span>. López-López and García-Ruiz<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> produced a critical review of papers published over the last decade detailing alternative methods to the standard visual and chemical tests used to determine the muzzle to target distance of gun shots (43 references). The review focused on two types of target, clothing and skin, and covered a range of atomic spectroscopic techniques including AAS, ICP-OES and ICP-MS. However, it was concluded that the simultaneous detection of several elements in a non-destructive nature makes analysis using XRF standout. Santos <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> used ICP-MS to demonstrate a simple linear relationship between the firing distance and the concentration of Ba, Pb and Sb in the GSR. Test shots from a Browning 0.32ACP pistol were made into cotton tissue targets. Small samples were cut from the target at increasing distance from the entry hole and the metal content determined using ICP-MS, following acid extraction. Using this approach it was possible to estimate the shooting distance within ±6 cm.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A new analytical method for the collection and quantification of GSR using ICP-OES was proposed by Vanini <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> Optimization of the spectrometer operating parameters, detailed in a later paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> allowed the determination of Ba, Pb and Sb with detection limits of 4.79, 0.15 and 1.49 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively. The investigation focused on three important factors in sample collection: the collection region of the hand; tape-type <span class="italic">versus</span> sample swab; and concentration variations between left and right hands. Swab collectors provided greater collection efficiency compared with the tape-type collectors. Additionally, the extraction of analytes from tape-type collectors was performed in a microwave using a solution of nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide and water, whereas the extraction of analytes from swab collectors could be simply performed in an ultrasonic bath. One interesting observation was that male shooters had higher concentrations of Pb in the GSR at the back of the hand than found on women shooters. This phenomenon was thought to occur because male hands have more and thicker hair, allowing higher adhesion of GSR. The same group of authors published a further paper employing the optimized method for the characterization of GSR from a range of pistol types.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a></p>

          <span>With used automotive catalytic converters (ACC) continuing to be regarded as an important source of PGMs it is not surprising that analytical methodology for their determination continues to feature in the literature.

Mixing and evaporation was followed by pressing the powder at 15 MPa to produce a 20 mm pellet for calibration by standard addition. Establishment of the optimal sample preparation conditions permitted the determination of Pt content from 0.01 to 0.2 wt% and Rh from 0.005 to 0.06 wt%.</span>

            <span class="italic">Cloud point extraction has gained popularity</span> as a pre-concentration method of low level PGM because of its low cost and simple procedures.

Suoranta <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> discussed the use of sulfamic acid as a means of eliminating the nitric-related problems for the preparation of a used ACC material, NIST SRM 2557, for subsequent analysis using ICP-MS. It was suggested that sulfamic acid acts as a nitrous acid scavenger, preventing the unwanted formation of nitrosyl complexes of PGM that can cause low recoveries during extraction. The optimized method involved the microwave-assisted extraction of 40 mL sample solutions at 90 °C in the presence of 0.5 g of sulfamic acid, 3 mL of 10% Triton X-100 and 4 mL of 1% 2-mercaptobenzothiazole with an extraction time of 75 minutes. Recoveries of Au, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru obtained in solutions were between 80 and 100%. However, the recovery of Ir did not exceed 40%. Two alternative PGM pre-concentration methods were reported by Tokalıoğlu and colleagues at Erciyes University, Turkey.

Analysis of the combined <span class="italic">in situ</span> data yielded a quantitative picture of the evolution of the diameter, shape, lattice packing and density of the deposited Pt clusters. Additionally, the degree of oxidation at the cluster surface after ozone pulses, could be monitored. An in-depth understanding of the chemical state and spatial distribution of polypyrrole and Co in electrochemically synthesized oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysts was realised using combined STXM, XRF mapping and μXAS measurements at the TwinMic beamline of Elettra synchrotron facility (Trieste, Italy).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit107"><sup><span class="sup_ref">107</span></sup></a> The photon beam was focused to a microprobe using zone plate optics and the imaging measurements were performed by simultaneous detection of transmitted and emitted (fluorescence) photons raster-scanning the sample with respect to the microprobe.

Together with data from catalytic testing, the results highlighted the interaction between the elements of the catalytic film and those of the metallic support. It is the nature of the crystalline phase and the distribution of Rh on the coating that play a key role in its properties. Results showed that a chemical reaction between Al, coming from the foam support, and Mg in the coating occurred during calcination at high temperature.

Then arsine was generated using a continuous flow system and flushed onto the catalysts in the graphite tube for 10 min. Finally, ETAAS measurements at an atomization temperature of 2250 °C were performed. Following this step, water samples containing arsenic were mixed with a reducing agent (0.5% m/v sodium tetrahydroborate) in a gas–liquid separator and arsine was produced. The volatile hydride was separated and carried by an argon stream to a quartz substrate containing immobilized catalyst nanoparticles.

Misra<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a> pointed out that TXRF has not been used very frequently for the analysis of nuclear materials. The review provided a brief introduction to the technique and highlighted why it is well-suited to the determination of trace and major elements. These reasons include the multi-element capability and the requirement for very small sample amounts. Also discussed were some of the applications undertaken at the author's own laboratory. The overview contained 33 references. A similar paper by the same author<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> (with 29 references) also provided reasons for the use of XRF techniques for nuclear materials analysis, but did not limit itself to TXRF. The technique of μ-XRF was also included in that review. The better geometry for high flux and the use of radiation filters to reduce the background signal in modern EDXRF instruments have enabled the analysis of samples sealed inside thin polymer-based covers. This approach avoids the necessity of encapsulating an instrument in a glove box and therefore simplifies the maintenance and operation of instrumentation. The high intensity focused excitation sources used in μ-XRF have enabled the study of the compositional uniformity of mixed uranium–thorium oxide pellets produced by different processes. It was emphasized that such an approach is simple, rapid (because no sample preparation is required) and is not sample destructive.

          <span id="sect1293"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.4.2 Analysis of nuclear fuels. </span>
          <span>Several papers reported the analysis of nuclear fuels and, since the fuels are obviously radioactive, <span class="italic">the use of LIBS is still a common option</span> because of its standoff ability. One example was published by Tampo <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">139</span></sup></a> who used microwave assisted LIBS for the remote analysis of nuclear fuel recycling. A high resolution spectrometer is required for the analysis of nuclear fuels to prevent interferences from the line-rich sample. The microwave assistance enhanced the sensitivity of Gd by a factor of 50 and this compensated for the signal loss arising from the use of a high resolution spectrometer. The sample was ablated using a Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm, with an energy of 5 mJ and a duration of 5 ns. The plume was then passed through a microwave discharge operating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and at a current of 250 W in a wire loop. The microwave pulse was timed to start 10 μs before the laser pulse so that the microwave field could reach a maximum intensity. Emitted light was detected using a high resolution echelle spectrometer (resolution of 0.0004 nm) over the wavelength range 250–1100 nm. The arrangement enabled Eu to be determined in gadolinium oxide over the range 100 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to 5%. The detection limit was 40 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The system was compact, flexible and could be applied to other sample types as well as nuclear fuel. A second paper to use LIBS was presented by Saeki <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">140</span></sup></a> These authors developed an instrument capable of analysing fuels and nuclear-based debris under coolant water. The aim was to apply it to the analysis of material at the post-accident Fukushima plant. However, in this paper they contented themselves with a feasibility study in which simulated material, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> cerium dioxide as a surrogate for uranium dioxide, as well as zirconium dioxide for cladding material and iron as construction material were tested. The instrument comprised a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, a pulse duration of 6 ns, a repetition rate of 1 Hz and a power of 5–10 mJ, a fiber optic and a Czerny–Turner spectrometer with an intensified CCD detector. The instrument was capable of either single pulse breakdown or double pulse breakdown. In both cases, a gas flow through the LIBS head formed a dome during the ablation process enabling the emitted light to pass through gas rather than water, preventing quenching. This feasibility study demonstrated that the LIBS system developed was capable of the analysis of the debris.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers by Krachler <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the use of <span class="italic">ICP-OES for the analysis of spent nuclear fuel</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141,142</span></sup></a> In the first of these, <small><sup>237</sup></small>Np was determined without prior isolation from other matrix components. A total of 13 Np wavelengths were tested in terms of sensitivity, peak shape, interferences and background signal. Some had very broad peaks (up to 35 pm) and others were split into multiplets. Despite these problems, LODs were an order of magnitude lower than in previous studies. The lowest LOD (3.1 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) was obtained at 382.92 nm, but this had a severe spectral interference from Nd at 382.914 nm. Unfortunately, since Nd is present in many spent fuels, this line was of limited use. A study of interferences found that Nd, Pu, Th and U all caused interferences at some Np lines. Three wavelengths (410.84 nm, 429.09 nm and 456.04 nm) were identified as being useful analytically for this sample type. Results from the ICP-OES analysis of deposit samples were cross-validated by those from a SF-ICP-MS instrument. The second paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> was similar to the first, but with Am as the analyte of interest. This time, six Am wavelengths were tested with 283.226 nm providing the lowest LOD (0.07 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), but with 408.929 nm yielding the most accurate results. Calibration using standard additions and external calibration yielded similar Am results. A homemade stock solution of Am was tested against a calibration curve run on a SF-ICP-MS instrument prepared using the signals from <small><sup>238</sup></small>U and <small><sup>232</sup></small>Th and corrected for mass bias. Results were similar, demonstrating the validity of the calibration method. The ICP-OES data from the analysis of one thorium/plutonium oxide spent fuel and two uranium/thorium fuels were again cross-validated using a SF-ICP-MS instrument.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">determination of Nd isotope ratios in irradiated nuclear fuel</span> is fundamental for the validation of neutronic calculation codes, especially the burn-up qualification. Unfortunately, there are potentially several spectral and non-spectral interferences that can confound the calculations. Gueguen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> have overcome these problems by coupling ion exchange chromatography on-line with a MC-ICP-MS instrument. The paper was split into two main sections. The first investigated the causes of the isotope ratio drifts so often seen during transient signal acquisitions, finding that there were two main causes. These were the mass-dependent isotopic fractionation on the chromatographic column and the time lags between the amplifier responses for the Faraday cup detectors. The second part of the paper described the development of a new approach for the correction of mass bias. The authors termed their method “Intra-injection Sample Standard Bracketing”. This was based on the on-line injection of the standard through the chromatographic system before and after the analyte peak. The method was, according to the authors, particularly suited to the analysis of nuclear materials. Results from the method were comparable to those obtained using off-line measurements and from a traditional sample –standard bracketing technique.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Using synchrotron μ-XRF, the <span class="italic">uniformity of uranium-thorium oxide pellets</span> prepared using two different processes (powder metallurgical compaction and coated agglomerate pelletization) was determined by Misra <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a> The U distribution in pellets prepared using powder metallurgical compaction was uniform, whereas those prepared using coated agglomerate pelletization was not. The actual preparation of the sample for analysis was far simpler using the μ-XRF technology than for SEM. These fuel pellets are used in advanced heavy water reactors and the authors' discovery that the uniformity of the U varies between preparation methods is worth considering. It is unfortunate that the coated agglomerate pelletization methodology is the safer of the two procedures in that there is less exposure of personnel to high radiation doses.</p>

            <span class="italic">The isotopic ratio of U in uranium particles</span> gives an indication of the last time it was last processed and can provide information on where it was produced or whether it has been used for un-declared nuclear activities, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> preparation of nuclear weapons. There has, therefore, been continued interest in studies such as these. The research group at the Japanese Atomic Energy Agency, based in Ibaraki, provided two papers that utilized TIMS for the identification of nuclear particles.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145,146</span></sup></a> In the first of these, TIMS was used alongside fission track analysis to determine the isotopic ratios of individual particles. The drawback is that occasionally, more than one particle is measured simultaneously (termed particle mixing), and this can lead to erroneous conclusions. The study discussed the use of micro-sampling using SEM to ensure that this phenomenon was minimized. The procedure was validated through the successful analysis of the reference materials NIST SRM 950a and CRM U-010 (originally released by NBS, now available from New Brunswick Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy). The other paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit146"><sup><span class="sup_ref">146</span></sup></a> discussed the determination of U/Pu atomic ratios in mixed particles. The authors determined the analytes using a method that involved the continual increase in the filament current and compared these measurements with those made after a more traditional chemical separation of Am, Pu and U. The samples used were prepared from a mixture of reference materials CRM U-010 uranium and NIST SRM 947 plutonium with U/Pu ratios of 1, 5, 10, 18 and 70. The isotope ratios obtained were in agreement with the expected values.</span>

After evaporation of the water, the particle remaining in the beaker was acid digested using 1 mL of nitric and 1 mL of hydrofluoric acids, on a hotplate at 200 °C.

          <span>The radioactive nature of most of these components has led to the development of <span class="italic">standoff analysis techniques such as LIBS</span>.

Hai <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed double pulse LIBS methods for the characterization of the laser cleaning of a first mirror<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit150"><sup><span class="sup_ref">150</span></sup></a> and as an <span class="italic">in situ</span> diagnostic tool for wall composition<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">151</span></sup></a> of the HL-2A tokamak in China. In the first of these applications, a laser pulse was used to ablate the co-deposition layer from the mirror. However, the single pulse was insufficient to produce a LIBS signal. Therefore, double pulse LIBS was used in which the second pulse excited the ablated plume providing a significant enhancement in LIBS signal. This on-line method was suitable for preventing under-cleaning of the mirror. The second paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">151</span></sup></a> also discussed the sensitivity shortcomings associated with single pulse LIBS and used double pulse LIBS for the analysis of impurities on the divertor tiles of the tokamak wall. A systematic study of the effect of the inter-pulse delay on the signal was performed. For a molybdenum tile, the signal was enhanced by a factor of 6.5 when a delay time of 1.5 μs was used. The analytes (Ca, Cr, Fe, Mo, Ni, Si and Ti) also demonstrated a significant LIBS signal when the double pulse configuration was employed whereas no signal was observed when single pulse LIBS was used.</span>

The second layer (anti-reflection coating layer) gave signals from Ca and Mg and the inner layer emitted light from Al, B and Si. Principal component analysis of the LIBS data facilitated the differentiation between the three different layers. High resolution spatial mapping of the deposited layer on a tokamak mirror was also reported by Xiao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">153</span></sup></a> These authors used LA microprobe TOF-MS for the analysis with data acquisition using LabVIEW software.

This usually means that the material must be crushed and then ground into a fine powder and then dispersed in a suitable solvent. The grinding process can be achieved in many ways and by using different materials.

The system's optimal conditions used 0.1 M nitric acid, a voltage of 1060 V with a flow rate of 2 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a sample concentration of 10 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The samples were also prepared using a high temperature acid dissolution method and then analysed using axial ICP-OES. The results from the two methods were in good agreement. In addition, the CRM NIST 154c was analysed to give extra method validation. In the SC-GD-AES method the Ti emission intensity was very low. This meant that the matrix exerted fewer interferences during the determination of the analytes. Detection limits ranged from 0.02 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Li and Mg to 5 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Fe. An investigation into improving the sensitivity of Pb was also undertaken.

          <span id="sect1431"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.1 Analysis of archaeological and historical samples. </span>
          <span>The use of atomic spectrometry for the analysis of archaeological or historical ceramics/pottery continues to be a rich source of research. There are numerous papers published in this area and so the focus of this section will be those that offer some novelty in terms of the atomic spectrometry. This means that those papers that use different sample introduction systems or manipulate the data using chemometrics packages are more likely to be reviewed compared with those that report a simple digestion and then aspirate the digest into an atomic spectrometry instrument. As always with these sample types, most workers attempt to inflict minimal damage and therefore solid sampling techniques such a LA-ICP-MS, LIBS or one of the variants of XRF are commonly reported.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A review (with 54 references) of the <span class="italic">use of LIBS in archaeometry</span> was published by Spizzichino and Fantoni.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit163"><sup><span class="sup_ref">163</span></sup></a> The review gives a brief overview of the principles, goes on to discuss the use of LIBS in conjunction with other techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LIF and Raman and then discusses the use of chemometric tools such as PCA for obtaining maximal information from the data. The final sections of the review concentrate on giving examples of the analysis of ceramics, glasses, metal alloys, paintings and gems.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As in previous years, the review of the atomic spectrometric analysis of archaeological samples will be tabulated (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). This is because most of the applications are very much orientated towards the archaeology rather than the analytical chemistry and often, there is a shortage of experimental detail.</p>

          <span>The literature on the creation of new types of semiconductor materials continues to expand year on year. However, while a wide range of techniques (including SIMS, XPS, Auger, XANES, PIXE, EDXRF, TXRF ICP-MS, ICP-OES, AAS, GD-MS, GD-OES, EDXRF, RBS and others in combination) may be applied in providing a perspective on the understanding of the nature of novel materials produced in such work, there is often relatively little analytical insight provided. Consequently, only those papers in which significant development of analytical methodology is the primary focus of the work are reviewed here.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">The analysis of complex semiconductor materials</span> has always presented challenges in relation to achieving <span class="italic">reliable quantification</span>. The ISO Technical Committee 201 on Surface Chemical Analysis has produced an authoritative update report describing the development of standards for reliable surface analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a> Topics discussed included a description of the work of the expert Technical Committee; the process for prioritization of standard development, the approach taken in inter-laboratory comparisons, and standards for reporting. A table listing the available ISO standards and technical documents in seven categories (general, Auger-electron spectroscopy and XPS, GDS, scanning probe microscopy, SIMS, sputter depth profiling, and X-ray reflectance and T-XRF), was presented. A specific review (38 references, in Chinese) of LA-ICP-MS to the surface microanalysis of materials including semiconductors is worthy of some attention in this context.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> It was recognised that LA-ICP-MS has now matured as a complementary tool to other forms of surface analysis citing high sensitivity and minimal sample preparation as key advantages over other competing techniques.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Argon cluster ion beam sputtering</span> has been used increasingly in SIMS in recent years because of the minimal sample damage caused during depth profiling in comparison with that resulting from the use of monatomic ions. However, while this approach has seen great success in characterizing polymer and organic sample types, its use has been less well documented in the semiconductor field. The use of Ar cluster ion beam sputtering has been applied to the study of five compound semiconductors (CdTe, GaAs, GaP, InAs and ZnSe) and considered with particular reference to sample damage.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a> The expectation prior to the study was that inorganic materials would be unlikely to be damaged by use of cluster ions and this was found to be the case for most of the materials studied. However, surprisingly, it was reported that damage to InAs materials using this approach could be very high resulting, in some cases, in the formation of visible metallic In. <span class="italic">Argon ion cluster sputtering</span> has also been investigated in relation to InSb by a separate group.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> In contrast to the observation for InAs above, it was reported that the approach was effective for sputter depth profiling of InSb. The maximum depth resolution was obtained at an incident angle of zero degrees using energy of 20 keV. However, it was also observed that while surface roughness was lower for Ar cluster ion sputtering compared with Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small> irradiation at 3 keV, under some conditions a ripple formation could be observed which affected the depth resolution that could be achieved. Clearly, the use of cluster ions sputtering in application to semiconductor materials should be treated with some caution until the possible effects of damage are better understood.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Depth profiling of semiconductor materials</span> remains a key area of methodological development. For example a combined SIMS and angle-resolved XPS approach has been proposed to minimize sputtering derived artefacts and matrix effects affecting depth distribution in implanted silicon.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> Thus single crystal Si (100) wafers were implanted using a 15 keV energy beam and ion fluences of 4 × 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (high dose) and 5 × 10<small><sup>14</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (low dose) conditions. For B, the wafers were implanted using a 7 keV energy and 5 × 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (high dose) and 5 × 10<small><sup>14</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (low dose) conditions. For SIMS determination of P, a Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam was used, whereas for B an O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> primary beam was employed, both operated at an energy of 2 keV and at the normal angle of incidence. The XPS technique was used in the variable angle mode to determine the native oxide thickness and relative positions of implants in the material and then using this to calibrate SIMS response. The impurity doses in native oxide and Si substrates were subsequently satisfactorily quantified under a range of thermal treatments, helping to explain the related diffusion properties of the doped materials.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Contamination of ultra large scale integration devices</span>, such as wafers, by Cu, is problematic because the element is highly soluble in silicon and can diffuse through the material even at room temperature. Such contaminants are usually removed by oxygen precipitated in the wafers <span class="italic">via</span> a process known as ‘gettering’. While highly sensitive bulk analysis techniques such as ICP-MS and ETAAS can determine Cu at very low levels, these methods are destructive and time consuming. An alternative approach has been proposed for the measurement of gettering efficiency based on TOF-SIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179</span></sup></a> Samples (1 cm by 1.3 cm in size) were initially treated with HF because the presence of native oxide affects Cu measurements. Contamination was introduced by dipping the samples in Cu solution for 5 min. A relative sensitivity factor for Cu was used to calibrate the SIMS response to account for matrix variability (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> due to oxide levels). When the sample was treated with HF, SIMS matrix effects were minimized in comparison with measurement of samples that were either annealed to create an oxide layer or subjected to conventional hydrophilization <span class="italic">via</span> exposure to a NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>OH–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O (ratio 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>5) mixture.

          <p class="otherpara">Titanium nitride is usually applied to silicon wafers to provide a diffusion barrier to maintain electrical conductivity. The material is extremely hard and exhibits strong adhesion to the substrate. An investigation has been undertaken to examine the factors affecting the performance of LA-ICP-MS in <span class="italic">depth profiling titanium nitride thin films</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> The coatings were deposited on the substrate using an arc ion-plating technique and analysed using an ICP-MS instrument equipped with a commercially available Nd:YAG laser (output wavelength: 213 nm). Samples were ablated under helium (1 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) using an applied power of 1.3 mJ (30%) and a 25 μm spot size. The ablation craters produced in the coated material were examined using SEM. As might be anticipated, the TiN coating was subject to less thermal degradation than the Si substrate although differences in behaviour were noted between the centre and edge of the ablation crater. However the penetration depth was found to vary inversely with laser pulse repetition rate (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> greater depth was achieved at low repetition rates down to 1 Hz). Thus, a 1 μm thick TiN coating took 26 shots to ablate at an average rate of 40 nm per shot. The increase in penetration depth at low laser pulse frequency was attributed to the low thermal conductivity of the TiN film which resulted in greater material residual stress.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">thickness of films or layers</span> is an important parameter that affects the functionality of semiconductor materials.

The trace element content of these materials is very important because it affects cell efficiency.

The OES technique was also able to provide layer thicknesses as low as 13 nm for the P-doped a-Si–H layer and it was suggested that it was possible to identify diffusion processes. In the GD-MS investigation,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185</span></sup></a> particular attention was paid to possible spectral interferences (<span class="italic">e.g.</span><small><sup>30</sup></small>Si<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small> or <small><sup>14</sup></small>N<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small> on <small><sup>31</sup></small>P).

          <span>There is increasing recognition of the environmental impact of end of life redundant electronic equipment and devices including display screens, printed circuit boards, lithium ion batteries, and other materials associated with their construction and in their recycling. However, since much of the work published in the year under review is based on prior art in the analytical literature with the novelty residing primarily in the application, only those examples of methodological interest are considered here. Details of specific applications of atomic spectrometry techniques to the characterization of electronic equipment and devices is summarised in the accompanying table (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>).</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The degradation in performance and recycling of <span class="italic">lithium ion battery components</span> and materials have remained the subject of study since the previous ASU review.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> A twenty three page review of the development of combined spectroscopy and microscopy techniques for <span class="italic">in situ</span> characterization of these devices has also been published.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">191</span></sup></a> Topics examined included the application of XRF microscopy, Raman, microscopy, transmission X-ray microscopy, SEM and TEM to the study of metal and metal oxide-based anode materials and layered oxy-sulfite, metal fluoride and Li based cathode materials.</p>

The sample was kept under an argon atmosphere at all times. The X-ray beam was passed through vacuum which facilitated the detection of low-energy S X-ray emission. Using this arrangement, the presence of Li polysulfides was identified in the cathode films.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">European Directive</span> (RoSH 2011/65/EU) on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, specifies that plastics with brominated flame retardants (BFRs) with content above 0.1% are identified and removed from the recycling process. This represents a major challenge for the electronics industry, because such materials may be incorporated in waste electrical equipment from both inside and outside the EU. For this reason a rapid sorting procedure for the detection of Br in such materials has been developed using XRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> Raman spectroscopy was then employed to confirm the presence of brominated flame retardants.

Spectra were recorded for each ablation event over the wavelength range 186 to 1040 nm. Following a PCA study of the data, emission lines were selected for analysis for 18 elements. The relative intensities obtained were then used to normalise the response and a further PCA carried out. As a result it was confirmed, unsurprisingly, that Au was principally located in the electrical contacts, whereas Si was distributed within the bulk material of the board. The approach was also applied to a printed circuit board from a computer mouse for the determination of Pb using 5 separate wavelengths for measurement.

        <h3 id="sect1902"><span class="b_heading">3.3 Glasses</span></h3>
        <span>Methodologies for determining the bulk composition of glasses continue to appear, despite the fact that well-established techniques such as ICP-OES and XRF are well suited to this application. Indeed the advocates of alternative techniques often make this point by default by using one or other as a reference method. A summary of reports concerning the analysis of glass is provided in the accompanying table.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Developments in the analysis of glasses fall into three distinct categories: (a) those involving direct sampling of the glass without the need for chemical digestion, (b) those involving analysis with spatial or depth resolution and (c) those where particular improvements in sensitivity, accuracy and or precision are required to fulfil the needs of the application. The advantages of LA techniques for the rapid analysis of glass have been explored for one or more of these purposes. Thus, the application of LA-ICP-MS using <span class="italic">different laser sampling systems</span> has been investigated for the quantitative multi-element analysis of glasses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit196"><sup><span class="sup_ref">196</span></sup></a> Femtosecond and nanosecond lasers with operating wavelengths of 193 nm, 365 nm and 795 nm were evaluated for the determination of major, minor and trace elements in glass CRMs (NIST SRM 612, BCR-2G, GSE-1G (both available from United States Geological Survey) and BAM-S005A). An internal standard element was used to calibrate response. It was reported that similar performance could be achieved for all three laser sampling systems when Ca was adopted as the internal standard. However, if Si was used instead for this purpose, the fs laser operated at 795 nm produced deviations of up to 20% under the operating conditions selected. Fractionation calculations indicated that these differences arose from changes in the composition and particle size distribution of aerosols formed during sampling which were, in turn, affected by laser fluence and spot size.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Differences in <span class="italic">elemental fractionation in the analysis of glasses</span> by LA-ICP-MS have also been investigated by a separate group of researchers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit197"><sup><span class="sup_ref">197</span></sup></a> An excimer ns laser and a fs laser operated at 193 nm and 257 nm respectively were used to sample NIST SRM 610 and GSE-1G (USGS) silicate glasses. In contrast to the previous study, the most significant fractionation occurred when using the ns laser and was eliminated when using the fs laser at 257 nm. Laser fluence was only found to contribute to fractionation of Bi, Pb and Sb out of 17 elements studied. A smaller spot size (24 μm) was recommended for analytical measurements in order to reduce laser-induced fractionation effects. Under optimum conditions selected for fs LA-ICP-MS, agreement with reference values was better than 10% for most of the elements in MPI-DING, USGS, and NIST glasses. It is worth commenting that these two reports are not inconsistent as both indicate that good results can be achieved using appropriate internal standard response normalization strategies. However, it does indicate the importance of careful evaluation of laser selection and operating conditions in the direct analysis of glasses.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Isotope dilution</span> provides a convenient means of improving both accuracy and precision in solution-based ICP-MS. However the application of on-line ID in the direct analysis of glasses by LA-ICP-MS represents a more complex challenge because of the potential for poor mixing of the spike sample aerosol.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit198"><sup><span class="sup_ref">198</span></sup></a> In order to obtain the good isotope equilibrium needed for ID-LA-ICP-MS, four different mixing devices (including pre- and post-cell introduction of the isotope spike) were designed and evaluated for application to the determination of Pb in silicate glasses. A pre-cell connection mode provided optimum performance in respect of consistency of the blended Pb isotopes, delivered good precision in the measurement of the <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>207</sup></small>Pb isotope ratio, and exhibited significantly less loss of sensitivity than in post cell mode. Good agreement was achieved with certified values for Pb in NIST SRM 619 glass.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">LIBS</span> is often applied to the <span class="italic">direct determination of the composition of glasses</span>. Reports of this type continued in the year under review, citing advantages of rapid analysis times and the possibilities for <span class="italic">in situ</span> measurement. However, while challenges undoubtedly remain in quantification related to calibration strategies, its application to depth- or laterally-resolved characterization of functional glasses is less well explored. A ns UV Nd:YAG laser was employed in a LIBS system to investigate the homogeneity of vitrified Mn-doped glasses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit199"><sup><span class="sup_ref">199</span></sup></a> Samples were ablated in air at atmospheric pressure using a laser pulse irradiance of 1.7 × 10<small><sup>9</sup></small> W cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. The emission from the laser plasma thus generated was integrated spatially and imaged on the spectrometer slit using a fibre-optic collection device. The homogeneity of the glass was verified by sampling at different sites on the glass surface and capturing the emission generated. The results achieved correlated well with those obtained from surface elemental mapping using SEM-EDX. The concentrations of Mn determined by the method were in good agreement with certified values for the bulk material, suggesting that interference effects in the LIBS analysis were minimal.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">X-ray fluorescence is a technique that is well known to be ideally suited to the analysis of glasses</span> because of its ability to examine solid samples rapidly and non-destructively on a quantitative or qualitative basis. However, the development of field portable XRF equipment has opened up new opportunities in the forensic analysis of glasses that has so far been under-exploited.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit200"><sup><span class="sup_ref">200</span></sup></a> In this study, a portable XRF instrument was used to rapidly scan 25 glass samples for major (Al, Ca, Na, O, and Si) and trace (Fe, K, Rb, Sn, Sr and Zr) elements. The technique identified certain elements that showed variation between samples (Fe, K, Sr, Zr). The results could be used to discriminate 98.3% of 7500 pair-wise comparisons of glass samples indicating that the technique has significant potential in forensic applications.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally, the <span class="italic">direct analysis of glasses is not normally associated with ETAAS</span> because of the refractory nature of the material which is difficult to atomise and the high background signals generated in the vaporization of solids.

          <span>Field flow fractionation is an established <span class="italic">technique for determining particle size distribution</span> of nanoparticles and may be applied to the analysis of natural particulates existing in the environment or engineered nanoparticles. When coupled with ICP-MS, a powerful technique capable of size distribution with simultaneous component characterization is obtained. There have been two review papers published in this period. One by Meermann<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> contained 51 references and discussed the trends in applications and gives the author's own insight into possible future directions. Its application for both naturally occurring colloids and engineered particles was highlighted. The second review, by Pornwilard and Siripinyanond,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit230"><sup><span class="sup_ref">230</span></sup></a> contained 65 references. It highlighted the number of applications per year since 1992 and identified the research institutes that produced them. Also included were separate sections for natural colloids and silver, gold and titanium nanoparticles. A further section entitled “other inorganic nanoparticles” reviewed quantum dots, selenium-, beryllium- and silica-based particles. Again, the authors provided their insight into possible future directions of research. These included combining the use of FFF with single particle analysis and determining the effects of different coatings present on the particles. This latter point is of significance because it is known that different coatings can have an effect on agglomeration and hence the particle sizing can be affected.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The determination of <span class="italic">Ag nanoparticles</span> using FFF-ICP-MS was addressed by two research groups.

The authors discussed how the particles were made and how the pH determined the particle size. They then incubated solutions of nanoparticles with known concentrations of protein at 37 °C for different times. The binding stoichiometry between BSA and Ag nanoparticles was approximately 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>5 × 10<small><sup>−7</sup></small> (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> 2 × 10<small><sup>6</sup></small> molecules of BSA were attached to a single nanoparticle). The binding stoichiometry with the other proteins was not determined. The other paper, by Ramos <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit232"><sup><span class="sup_ref">232</span></sup></a> described how Ag nanoparticles in nutraceuticals and beverages were quantified. After optimization of the operating conditions of the FFF separation, a wide dynamic range spanning 10–1000 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained with a LOD of 28 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Silver nanoparticles are renown for agglomeration and, since this can confound the FFF separation, the authors resorted to using an ultrasonic probe for 90 seconds (45 pulses of 2 s duration) to ensure disaggregation. Total concentration data were in good agreement with those obtained using ultracentrifugation followed by acid digestion. The particle size distribution was also in agreement with that observed using TEM.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Gold nanoparticles</span> have also received attention in this review period. Meisterjahn <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233</span></sup></a> used a combination of detectors to determine the interaction between Au nanoparticles and naturally occurring ones because Au particles interfered with the light scattering detection that is usually used. Use of both ICP-MS and light absorbance detectors enabled distinction between heteroaggregation and homoaggregation. Addition of natural organic matter did not change the particle size distribution but did appear to stabilize the Au nanoparticles. However, fractograms of samples containing natural nanoparticles and Au particles but no organic matter showed a large change in particle size distribution. This led the authors to conclude that there were interactions between Au and natural nanoparticles. A second paper to discuss Au nanoparticle detection using FFF-ICP-MS was published by Mudalige <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> These authors pointed out the problem of nanoparticles causing fouling of the FFF membrane which leads to low analyte recoveries and decreased lifetime of the membrane. They tackled this issue by modifying the Au nanoparticles by functionalizing it with a phosphine molecule and by coating the surface of the membrane with a negatively charged polystyrenesulfonate polymer. The result was that improved separation of 10, 30 and 60 nm particles (obtained from NIST) and recoveries of 99.1% were achieved. A LOD of 6 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained.</p>

Coffee creamer was used as a model sample. The effects of sample de-fatting using organic solvents and sample preparation protocols that mimic the cooking process, were studied. The de-fatting with hexane had no effect on particle size or the particle size distribution. Similarly, raising the temperature to 60 °C also had no effect. Unspiked and sample spiked with food grade silicon dioxide were extracted and analysed. Detection using ICP-MS and post FFF calibration with ordinary aqueous standards enabled the elemental composition of the different size fractions to be quantified.

          <span id="sect1988"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.2 Single particle analysis. </span>
          <span>
            <span class="italic">Single particle analysis</span> is still a very “hot topic” for analysts working with nanoparticles because it has the potential for becoming one of the more appropriate methods for their size determination. The theory is that if the sample solution is sufficiently dilute and the dwell time is sufficiently low, then the counting statistics dictate that only one particle will be detected at any one time. The intensity of the peaks from the detector will therefore be directly proportional to the size of the particle being detected. Debate still continues as to whether one peak that is double in size of a second really does correspond to a particle being twice the mass of the other or whether two smaller sized particles are being detected simultaneously. Despite this debate continuing, several workers are starting to provide applications rather than concentrating on the theory. The subject area has only been in development for a few years, but already, sufficient papers have been published to warrant a review.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240</span></sup></a> This review, by Laborda <span class="italic">et al.</span>, contained 50 references and took the reader through the basic theory, giving the relevant equations. It then moved on to how to discriminate between dissolved ions and particles, discussed some applications and then gave examples of where SP-ICP-MS has been coupled with chromatographic systems.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Several papers have still worked on the theory of single particle analysis, with the <span class="italic">dwell time being one of the most crucial factors</span>. Two papers discussed the effect of dwell time on single particle analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241,242</span></sup></a> Both papers agreed that detection of a nanoparticle is an event with duration of approximately 0.5 ms. This can be problematic when many commercial instrument have a default dwell time of 10 ms. Hineman and Stephan<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241</span></sup></a> removed the settling time of the quadrupole mass spectrometer, enabling dwell times as low as 10 μs to be used. Such short dwell times decreased the background signal by three orders of magnitude compared with that at 10 ms. The NIST reference materials 8012 and 8013 gold nanoparticles were used as test materials for the experiments determining the effect of dwell time on particle sizing and the sample concentration. The paper by Montano <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit243"><sup><span class="sup_ref">243</span></sup></a> decreased the dwell time to 100 μs using commercially available hardware and software. They concluded that such a dwell time enabled clear distinction between signals from nanoparticles and ionic Ag in solution even when the latter was in ten-fold excess. They also concluded that low dwell times offer the possibility of determining more than one element or isotope in a single nanoparticle. A third paper discussed the SP-ICP-MS analysis of gold nanoparticles over the range 10–200 nm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit244"><sup><span class="sup_ref">244</span></sup></a> A dwell time of 10 ms was optimal to limit split particle events, particle coincidences and false positives. Using optimal sensitivity, the linear range was 10–70 nm. However, this could be extended to 200 nm by decreasing the sensitivity.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Single particle analysis is not rapid and the <span class="italic">data manipulation stage</span> after collection adds significantly to the time required. Bi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> used the K-means clustering algorithm to process single particle data. This improved discrimination of particle signals from background signals and provided a statically-based method to resolve different sized groups of nanoparticles. As an application Au nanoparticles with a nominal size of 80 nm, but with “impurities” of diameter 20 nm, 50 nm or 100 nm, comprising 2% by mass of the sample, were analysed. The results were in good agreement with those obtained using dynamic light scattering, but offered significantly better resolution. The process was then also applied to the analysis of cerium dioxide nanoparticles.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Isotope dilution analysis</span> (IDA) with single particle ICP-MS was described by Telgmann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit246"><sup><span class="sup_ref">246</span></sup></a> Under normal circumstances, size discrimination and concentration determination requires external calibration. Using the ID methodology, internal calibration was achieved, leading to a more rapid analysis. Silver nanoparticles with diameter 50 nm coated with citrate and 100 nm coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone were analysed using SP-ICP-MS with a solution enriched with <small><sup>109</sup></small>Ag being introduced <span class="italic">via</span> a T-piece. Dwell times of 1, 5 and 10 ms were tested and 5 ms yielded high intensity and supplied data that could easily be fitted into a Gaussian function. According to the authors, the 1 ms dwell time was insufficient to record an entire particle event and the 10 ms led to coincident particles being detected. The paper provided the equations that were used to determine the mass per particle using IDA data and, helpfully, took the reader through an example calculation. The LOD with respect to the particle size was 40 nm.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There are numerous <span class="italic">sources of error in single particle analysis</span>. A paper by Tuoriniemi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit247"><sup><span class="sup_ref">247</span></sup></a> discussed one of these sources, the nebulization efficiency. It is well known that most conventional nebulizers have a transport efficiency of sample to the plasma of significantly less than 20% (often less than 2%), with the finer particles being transported in preference to larger ones. Using citrate coated silver nanoparticles (nominal diameter 80 nm) and citrate coated gold particles (50, 100 and 250 nm) the authors tested the effects of the nebulization efficiency on the accuracy of the particle sizing. The waste collection method was used to calculate the nebulization efficiency. This involved collecting the waste from the spray chamber and weighing it and using a flow meter to measure the amount reaching the plasma. The accuracy of the particle size measurements was dependent on the uncertainty of the nebulization efficiency. This uncertainty was improved by correcting the efficiency for the partitioning effects. Once this was done, the particle size measurements achieved using single particle ICP-MS were in good agreement with those obtained using SEM. Other factors investigated included the duration of the particle events and the dwell time.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There have been several papers that have applied single particle ICP-MS to <span class="italic">the analysis of real samples</span>. Included in this number is a paper by Peters <span class="italic">et al.</span> who determined Ag nanoparticles in chicken meat.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit248"><sup><span class="sup_ref">248</span></sup></a> The material was digested using an enzyme rather than acid to ensure that the nanoparticles remained intact. After dilution, the analysis of the material which, contained up to 25 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of Ag nanoparticles of 60 nm diameter, led to good accuracy for particle size (98–99%) and for concentration (91–101%). The repeatability for the sizing was also good (better than 2%) but the repeatability for the concentration determination was less good (better than 11%). Reproducibility was less impressive with values for size and concentration being 6% and 16% respectively. A LOD of 0.1 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained which, given the circumstances, was impressive. However, the authors noted that the diluted Ag nanoparticles were not stable since they had a tendency to dissolve and then form silver sulfide. Another paper to determine Ag nanoparticles in foodstuffs (actually, food simulants) was prepared by Linsinger <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> This paper described an inter-laboratory study involving 23 labs throughout Europe, USA and Canada. The labs were sent three concentrated suspensions of Ag nanoparticles with nominal diameter 20, 40 and 100 nm and they then prepared eight more dilute suspensions in two food simulants (distilled water and 10% ethanol). Single particle ICP-MS was then used to analyse the suspensions. The average standard deviations for the repeatability and reproducibility for the median particle diameter were 1 and 14 nm respectively. The precision was worse for the concentration measurements (11% and 78% respectively). The authors stated that further improvements could be made if shorter dwell times were used, nebulizer efficiency measurements were made <span class="italic">etc.</span>, and therefore, the conclusions were largely in agreement with those made in papers discussed already in this review.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The problem of <span class="italic">silver nanoparticle dissolution</span> in natural, laboratory and processed waters is a subject tackled by Mitrano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit242"><sup><span class="sup_ref">242</span></sup></a> Silver nanoparticles of diameter 60 nm and 100 nm and coated with either citrate, tannic acid or polyvinylpyrrolidone were placed in water and their size monitored using SP-ICP-MS for 24 hours and for one week. The water chemistry played a critical role in the dissolution process. Chloride and sulfide at 1 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a dissolved organic carbon content of 20 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> resulted in negligible dissolution after 24 hours, whereas lower concentrations led to a decrease in particle diameter of approximately 10%. Interestingly, chlorinated tap water led to total dissolution within a few hours. The different coatings had a variable effect on dissolution. The single particle approach for determining particle diameter was claimed to be simpler than attempting to determine the ionic content.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">It is difficult to <span class="italic">distinguish signals arising from particles from those from dissolved ions</span>. Hadioui <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250</span></sup></a> attempted to resolve this problem by coupling ion exchange resins with SP-ICP-MS. The efficiency of the method was tested by using silver nanoparticles in the presence of various concentrations of silver ions as well as other major ions (calcium, chloride, magnesium, potassium and sodium). The ion exchange resins removed 1–4 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> spikes of the ionic Ag, facilitating the particle size determination, particularly of particles less than 60 nm in diameter. It was noted that although the proof of principle study was focused on Ag, it could be used for several particle types.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">detection limit</span> is normally associated with a concentration, but with SP-ICP-MS it can also apply to the smallest size of a particle that can be determined.

          <span>In addition to FFF coupled with ICP-MS, there have been several other chromatography types used to determine particle size distribution, particle components and mass concentration. When coupled with ICP-MS, <span class="italic">hydrodynamic chromatography</span> is capable of all of these. Two papers have discussed its use.

The LOD for Ag and Ti were 10 and 2 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively, which the author acknowledged was too high for natural water samples. Despite this, the technique was envisaged to be useful during the nanoparticle production process. A second paper to use hydrodynamic chromatography was by Proulx and Wilkinson.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> They spiked water samples with silver nanoparticles and then used hydrodynamic chromatography coupled with a dynamic light scattering detector to ensure that the chromatography worked.

The protocol developed was capable of separating a mixture of gold, silver and polystyrene nanoparticles with radii of 60, 40, 20 and 10 nm in a river water matrix.

The accuracy of the method was demonstrated by analysis of 10 and 30 nm gold nanoparticle reference materials.

Another area of research during this review period was the analysis of leachates from plastics, especially when the leachates were food simulants.

A Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm and pulse duration of 6 ns and repetition rate of 10 Hz was used to excite the samples and emitted light was detected using an echelle spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD camera. The identification was based on the detection of 12 elements (Al, C, Ca, Cl, F, H, K, Mg, N, Na, O and Ti) and two molecular bands (C–N and C–C). According to the authors, the C–N and C–C bands and the O line at 777.4 nm do not play an important role during the identification process. However, by multiplying their normalized intensities by 45.2, 5.96 and 4.755 respectively, and re-adjusting the ratings of the other lines, their roles become much more significant. This enables better classification of the different polymers. Without the adjustment, the polyethylene, polyurethane, polypropylene and polycarbonate were correctly identified 98, 74, 90 and 98% of the time. However, with the adjustment, they, like the other polymers tested, were correctly identified close to 100% of the time.</span>

          <span>An <span class="italic">inter-laboratory comparison study</span> was reported by Mutsuga <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> (in Japanese). Three types of PVC pellet used in food contact plastics were sent to 19 participating laboratories who were instructed to analyse them for their Cd and Pb content using three methods. The first was the standard method involving digestion using sulfuric acid followed by taking up of the residue using hydrochloric acid. Measurement could be achieved using either AAS or ICP-OES. Two alternative methodologies were tested. One used an acid digestion followed by evaporation to dryness on a hotplate and the other was a microwave assisted acid digestion. The standard method yielded data that were superior in quality (in terms of repeatability and reproducibility) compared with the hotplate evaporation. However, the microwave digestion provided data that were of better quality than the standard method and so it was concluded that either the standard method or the microwave digestion could be used. Detection could also be achieved using ICP-MS, but this technique required the sample to be digested completely.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The other study relevant to this section was provided by Cushen <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> who reported on the determination of <span class="italic">Ag leached from commercially available zeolite filler polyethylene composites</span>. Three commercial materials containing 0.5, 1 and 2% Ag ion filler were extracted using either 3% acetic acid or distilled water, according to EU Commission Regulation 10/2011. Some polyethylene materials made in-house containing 0.1 and 0.5% Ag nanoparticles were also tested. Results obtained using ICP-OES were compared with those from spectrophotometry. During the ICP-OES analysis, the authors took the precaution of using chloride-free Viton tubing rather than the standard PVC tubing to minimise the Ag interaction with chloride. However, they appear not to have used any sonication or even vortex mixing immediately prior to analysis which, given silver nanoparticles' proclivity to agglomerate, may have been an error.</p>

          <span id="sect2125"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.3 Determination of analytes in plastics. </span>
          <span>Some papers have discussed the determination of analytes in plastics associated with <span class="italic">waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)</span>, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> televisions and personal computers. Included in this number is a paper by Aldrian <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> who used a handheld (portable) XRF instrument to determine brominated flame retardants. Samples were first analysed using pXRF and then the same fragment was shredded and extracted using an accelerated solvent extraction prior to analysis using a standard GC-MS method. There was reasonable agreement between the two datasets. The time required for testing was important, with the relative errors for the pXRF data decreasing from 7–11% for a five second exposure to 4–8% for a 30 second one. However, it was thought that a 30 s exposure was excessive given the many hundreds of samples to be analysed daily. Overall, over 3000 pieces of plastic originating from televisions and 1600 pieces from computers were tested. Plastics from televisions were largely below the 300 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> threshold, with only 7% exceeding 50<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. However, nearly 40% of plastics from computers contained over 50<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of Br. Another application analysing WEEE products was reported by Aquino and Pereira,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> who used LIBS to analyse 144 fragments from 50 obsolete mobile phones. Data for 16 different analytes (some metallic, others being C, CN <span class="italic">etc.</span>) were obtained using a Nd:YAG laser operating at a wavelength of 1064 nm, a power of 100 mJ, a duration of 8 ns and a frequency of 10 Hz and a CCD spectrometer capable of detecting wavelengths between 186 and 1042 nm. Once the data were obtained, the authors used a range of chemometric tools (PCA, SIMCA, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and K-nearest neighbour) to classify the samples. A model was first constructed using some samples of known origin and then the chemometric tools were used to try and identify the manufacturer of other samples. The K-nearest neighbour technique was the most successful with correct identification close to 100% for all sample types. Slightly less successful was SIMCA, where correct identification was obtained in &gt;95% of samples for the white polymers and &gt;82% for the black polymers. The PLS-DA was the least successful, with correct identification rates of 16–32% being achieved. Most easily identifiable were the coated polymers, which tended to have significant quantities of Ag, whereas the uncoated polymers tended to have higher levels of Al, K, Na, Si and Ti.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Three papers described the <span class="italic">determination of hexavalent Cr</span> in polymers. Ohata and Matsubayashi<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit268"><sup><span class="sup_ref">268</span></sup></a> used XAFS and XANES to determine Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in the plastic CRMs NMIJ 8106a and NMIJ 8106a(02) (which are both acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene) and NMIJ 8136a – polypropylene; which have been developed by the National Metrology Institute of Japan. The first material was expected to have a Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> content of 100% of the total Cr because it had been added as lead chromate. The last two materials were expected to have a Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> content of approximately 25% of the total Cr because it was added as lead chromate and chromium acetylacetonate (Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>). Calibration for the XANES was accomplished by pressing pellets of plastic, methyl cellulose binder and lead chromate and/or chromium acetylacetonate. The last two components could have their proportions changed to obtain 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, 90, 95 and 100% Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>. The absorption of the pre-edge peak of Cr K-edge XANES spectra were summed and normalized and yielded straight calibrations, even though measurements were conducted at different beam time and beam line. The XAFS was achieved using 2.5 GeV and 300–450 mA. Results from the analysis of the materials were in agreement with the expected values. The authors concluded that the procedure they had developed could be useful for measurements associated with the EU's directive Restriction on the use of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in electrical and electronic equipment. The second paper, by Oki <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> described the use of XAFS to determine Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> and ICP-OES for the determination of total Cr in plastic and chromate conversion coating. The pre-edge peak intensity of the Cr K-edge increased linearly with the Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> amount. Results from the analysis were in good agreement with those obtained using a wet chemical analysis method. The third paper to have determined Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in polymers was reported by Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit270"><sup><span class="sup_ref">270</span></sup></a> The determination of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in the presence of Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> has been problematic for analysts implementing RoHS because the Cr is reduced to its trivalent state. The study by Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported a method that overcomes the problem. This involved the dissolution of the sample using alkaline tetrahydrofuran (THF) which formed an Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small>–THF adduct that was identified using MALDI-TOF, XRD and NMR as having the formula Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>5</sub></small>(THF)<small><sub>3</sub></small>. The polymers acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS), a heat resistant polystyrene and polycarbonate were mixed with appropriate amounts of lead chromate and antimony trioxide, a dispersing agent and an extruder, heated to 200 °C and extruded repeatedly to ensure homogeneity. These in-house reference materials were then extracted using the protocol developed and the extracts analysed using ICP-OES. The Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> data obtained were approximately 90% of the expected value for the ABS and the polycarbonate. However, the polystyrene material was less successfully analysed, yielding an extraction efficiency of only ∼72%.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have developed methods for the <span class="italic">determination of Br in polymers</span>. Ohata and Miura<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> developed an ID-ICP-MS system for the determination of Br in polypropylene pellets that are to be used by the National Metrology Institute of Japan to develop a reference material. The pellets and a spike of <small><sup>81</sup></small>Br were digested using nitric acid in a microwave oven. Two microwave units were tested, one of which used PTFE digestion bombs and the other a quartz vessel. The latter was the favoured option since the blank levels were lower. The analysis using ICP-MS was undertaken using samples diluted with water and others diluted with ammonia solution so that the final pH was approximately 9. The samples diluted using water led to severe memory effects, whereas those diluted in ammonia solution were washed out much more efficiently. Results from these analyses were compared with those obtained using INAA, with both techniques yielding results close to the expected value of 300 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The pellets were analysed using LA-ICP-MS to determine the Br homogeneity. The other paper to determine Br in polymers was reported by Gorewoda <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272</span></sup></a> who used WDXRF for the determination, even though the polymer samples were thinner than the critical thickness required for Br. This was especially true for cellulose and polyethylene samples that have a high Br critical thickness and yet come as thin sheets. Four different methods were developed to overcome this potential problem. The method that provided the best accuracy and longest linear range for calibration was slightly more costly and time-consuming than the others because it required the samples to be ground and for other chemicals to be added. In this procedure, 1 g of sample was ground with 0.5 g of the aluminium oxide abrasive and 0.2 g of the barium carbonate (a compound with a high absorption coefficient) and 1 mL of ethanol until the particle size was less than 0.2 mm. The mixture was then pressed into a disk. Calibration was achieved by preparing reference materials in the same way. The second method involved the pressing of the sample into disks. This method was rapid and could be used for routine analysis. However, it required careful optimization of the tube-detector geometry and mathematical manipulation of the data. The other methods used the Rayleigh line intensities from the tube as an internal standard for the Br Kα or Br Lβ line intensities. These two methods were the fastest, but were less precise and accurate than the others. They also had shorter linear ranges.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">SIMS or TOF-SIMS</span> was reported by Bailey <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273</span></sup></a> who used argon cluster sputtering and TOF-SIMS to obtain a three-dimensional characterization of multi-layer plastic films comprising alternating layers of polystyrene and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Uniform sputter rates were obtained even over depths of more than 15 μm. The use of the argon clusters for sputtering enabled measuring layer homogeneity, thickness and interface widths to be characterized far better than when C<small><sub>60</sub></small><small><sup><span class="italic">n</span>+</sup></small> was used. The data obtained for the layer thickness were in good agreement with those obtained using ellipsometry. According to the authors, “the quality of the data allowed a detailed analysis of the chemical structure of these systems, revealing some minor imperfections within the polymer layers”. This system could therefore be used to inform future systems manufacturing and development.</p>
