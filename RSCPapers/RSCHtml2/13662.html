Although many technologies have been explored to fabricate nanostructured materials, templated synthesis is one of the most important approaches to fabricate nanostructured materials with precisely controlled structures and morphologies from their constituent components. In this review article, we aim to highlight the use of the self-assembly of block copolymers as an emerging and powerful tool to fabricate well-defined nanomaterials with precise control over the structural dimensions and shape, as well as over the composition and corresponding spatial arrangement. After providing a brief introduction to the synthesis of regular porous materials, including silica- and carbon-based mesoporous materials, the review focuses on the fabrication of well-ordered nanoporous polymers from the selfassembly of degradable block copolymers, in particular with gyroid-forming network morphologies, as templates for the syntheses of various materials with different entities. We highlight the principles of different templated syntheses, from the fundamentals to their practical uses in the fabrication of nanohybrids and nanoporous materials; moreover, we provide an introduction to templates, precursors, solvents, and processing. Finally, some recent examples using block copolymer structure-directed nanomaterials for applications, such as solar cells, catalysis, and drug delivery, are presented. In particular, by taking advantage of the “well-ordered” structural characteristics of the gyroid texture, the properties and applications of 3D regular nanostructures, such as the photonic behavior and optical properties of gyroid-forming nanostructures, as well as of gyroid-forming metamaterials, will be emphasized. Special attention is also given to present new developments and future perspectives in this field.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2015/CS/c4cs00424h/c4cs00424h-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c4cs00424h-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2015/CS/c4cs00424h/c4cs00424h-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

      <h2 id="sect284"><span class="a_heading">1. Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>The use of manufacturing processes using prepared templates, also called templated synthesis or casting, is an ancient (over 6000 years) skill. The oldest surviving casting example is believed to be a copper frog cast in Mesopotamia probably around 3200 BC. After thousands of years of evolution for manufacturing technology as part of people's livelihood, templated synthesis is now well developed for extended applications from the manufacture of old coins to food shaping. In a templated synthesis, a liquid or a fluid material is poured into a prepared mold containing a hollow cavity of the desired shape and is then allowed to solidify. The solid part is then taken out after removal of the template to complete the process. Taking the manufacture of traditional Chinese yellow cake as an example (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>), at first, a mold/pan with a chosen shape is prepared, and then all the ingredients are mixed well and poured into the preheated pan. Any sweet filling (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> sweetened red bean paste) can be added according to one's taste into the inner of the yellow cakes. After heating for several minutes and then lifting up the lid slightly, delicious Chinese yellow cakes with fancy shapes and various flavors are ready for consumption. Another famous example of templated synthesis is the fabrication of sculptures. By templated synthesis/casting, complicated and delicate sculptures with fine details, made with different materials such as wax, iron, or copper, can be manufactured on a large scale. In other words, templated synthesis can be used for making products with complex shapes and diverse components that would be difficult to produce by other approaches. Yet, in contrast to the production of yellow cakes, how one fills the templates with the precursors for template synthesis, in particular for delicate textures, is critical to achieving the manufacturing goals. Over time, the ancient templated technology has been developed to form various tools and vessels essential to human life and culture. In addition to using for the necessities of life, the ancient skill was also used for human culture inheritance. One of the most famous examples is “Pâte de verre” – one of the lost wax processes. Pâte de verre is a well-developed and famous artistic skill used in the creation of traditional Taiwan glass art (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, Liuli).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> The process involved several complex processes per creation, including casting a wax sculpture in plaster (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2a</a>), melting out that wax (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2b</a>), and then adding glass ingredients to the leftover negative space (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2c</a>). Further steps involved breaking the plaster covering and then taking out the raw blank (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2d</a>).

      <p class="otherpara">Now in modern times, the development of materials has entered a new era—that of using nanoscale materials. Nanoscale materials are defined as those materials whose structural elements, such as clusters, crystallites or molecules, have dimensions in the 1 nm to 100 nm range. The exploration of nanomaterials in both academia and industry has been remarkable over the past decade, and has been driven by variations in their fundamental properties and potential applications. Materials can range from an “infinitely extended” solid (bulk) to a particle in a material consisting of a countable number of atoms, whose physical and chemical properties display special characteristics resulting from the confinement of electrons within a tiny space (in nanoscale materials). In particular, the most important nanomaterial systems are nanohybrids and nanoporous materials. Nanohybrids and nanoporous materials, whose properties depend on their individual components and morphologies, as well as on the corresponding interfaces, are potentially critical next-generation materials due to their excellent material characteristics, including optical, electrical, magnetic and catalytic properties, as well as their demonstrated mechanical properties. In particular, the syntheses of nanostructured materials with precisely controlled structures and morphologies have become the critical aims of extensive research over the last few years. Nanomaterials with a well-ordered texture not only give homogeneous properties for further applications, but can also provide novel and surprising properties due to their periodic and regular structures. However, it is still a challenge to fabricate materials in the nanoscale with well-ordered architectures in large-size monoliths or in large-area continuous films for device designs in modern applications.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In general, there are two approaches in the fabrication of nanomaterials: top-down and bottom-up methods.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> The top-down methods for processing nanostructured materials involve starting with a solid bulk and obtaining nanostructures <span class="italic">via</span> structural decomposition. For example, attrition and milling are typical top-down methods to obtain nanoparticles. It is well known that top-down methods can be used for the fabrication of complex and defined nanomaterials. However, the biggest problem with the top-down approach is the imperfection of the surface structure. For example, the most famous and convenient top-down method—lithography—can result in significant crystallographic damage to the processed materials, in which additional defects are even introduced.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> In addition, the size of the nanostructured materials produced from top-down methods is still limited, and the process is time consuming. Another approach is to use self-assembly to create ordered bulk or thin films <span class="italic">via</span> a bottom-up method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> Nature already uses self-assembling materials for nanostructures, such as the components of living cells. The bottom-up method refers to the building of materials from the bottom up, through an atom-by-atom, molecule-by-molecule, or cluster-by-cluster approach. Most biological systems also exhibit hierarchy and at least one distinct structural feature that lies within each length scale at the molecular, microscopic, nanoscopic (mesoscopic), and macroscopic regimes. Several levels of structures can be distinguished in proteins, bones, shells, and so on. For instance, the primary structure of the sequence of amino acid groups along the polypeptide chain in proteins can be developed into various secondary structural motifs, such as coils, sheets, and ribbons.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> The motifs are packed together to form a distinctive shape: the tertiary structure. Although nanomaterials from bottom-up methods promise a better chance to obtain nanoscale materials, it is not easy to obtain nanomaterials with a precisely controlled chemical composition and structural order.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">One easy way to fulfill the requirements for the fabrication of well-ordered nanomaterials is to acquire them through templated synthesis—an ancient technique combining bottom-up and/or top-down approaches. However, the above-mentioned ancient templated synthesis/casting techniques are constrained to a large size and have limitations in the centimeter range. However, if the templated synthesis could be scaled down to the nanometer scale, the ancient technique—<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, templated synthesis—should be able to create new applications from fabricating nanomaterials, leading to a new development of modern technologies. As a result, more and more approaches with respect to templated synthesis for the fabrication of well-ordered nanomaterials have been created, leading to a growing development of nanoscale templates (molds). Porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) as a template was the subject of the first attempt to scale down the templated synthesis to the submicrometer range for producing wire arrays.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Furthermore, Kyotani and co-workers were the first to fabricate microporous carbons using ultra-stable zeolite Y (USY) as a template, achieving a templated synthesis in the nanoscale.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> In 1998, Göltner and co-workers first proposed the concept termed as nanocasting for the fabrication of mesoporous materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> A mesoporous silica monolith with interconnective mesochannels was used as a template in a “two-step” templated synthesis (nanocasting) to prepare mesoporous polymeric networks with a well-ordered nanostructure from pre-made silica templates. From then on, templated synthesis has attracted increasing attention and has become one of the most important approaches for the synthesis of well-ordered nanohybrids and nanostructured materials, especially nanoporous materials. As a result, various templated syntheses utilizing the deposition of desired materials into pre-prepared well-ordered templates (so-called hard templates), such as AAO,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> arrays of colloidal crystals,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> mesoporous silica (MCM materials),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> and mesoporous carbon,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,13</span></sup></a> have been fully developed to fabricate well-ordered nanomaterials with pre-defined sizes and shapes, as well as order. In addition, to create well-ordered nanoarrays from nanoparticles and nanorods, templated synthesis can also be used for making complex shapes in the nanoscale that cannot be prepared or fabricated by other methods.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another form of templates can be used, namely soft templates, are usually amphiphilic molecules known as surfactants, which contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. In polar solvents, these surfactants can be co-assembled with precursors into supramolecular structures with various morphologies by altering certain variables (such as temperature, pressure, and surfactant concentration), leading to the resultant nanohybrid materials without the need for pre-forming the templates from a “one-step” templated synthesis. After removal of the amphiphilic molecules by calcination, inorganic porous materials with well-defined textures, such as silica- and carbon-based mesoporous materials with well-ordered structures, can be produced. Those well-ordered inorganic porous materials are suitable as templates for further templated syntheses. As mentioned above, a variety of well-ordered nanostructured materials can be fabricated through templated synthesis by using hard or soft templates; however, a majority of the well-defined templates are composed of inorganic materials (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, inorganic templates). As a result, it is still a challenge to remove the inorganic templates completely without causing damage to the filling materials when the fillers possess similar intrinsic properties to the matrix. For example, it is well known that almost all ceramic materials can be easily removed by wet chemical etching with hot sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or hydrofluoric acid (HF).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> However, it is difficult to selectively remove silica template (matrix) without damaging the ceramic fillers. Also, removal of the templates often involves the use of strong chemicals like HF, which is understandably undesirable. As a result, it is necessary to develop other templates (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, organic templates) to make the process of removing the templates easier to carry out. Note that organic materials can be degraded through ozone decomposition, UV degradation, reactive ion etching, and calcination. When seeking templates with easily degradable properties for templated synthesis but sufficient mechanical strength, nanoporous polymeric materials would be suitable candidates as templates. They would also make it much easier to create a monolith of nanomaterials with a large area, especially in the thin-film state, due to the easy processing of the polymeric materials. The development of manufacturing hybrid and porous materials with different templates is illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>; this shows that templated synthesis was created thousands of years ago and has been scaled down over many years, even reaching down to the nanometer scale in recent decades.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">In recent decades, block copolymers (BCPs) have been extensively investigated because of their ability to self-assemble into one-, two-, and three-dimensional (1D, 2D, and 3D) periodic nanostructures with a readily adjustable size, depending on their constituent compositions and molecular weights.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15–17</span></sup></a> By taking advantage of the degradable character of BCPs, nanoporous polymeric materials with well-ordered structures can be prepared by the preferential removal of the constituent components in BCPs through: ozonolysis,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18,19</span></sup></a> UV degradation,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> and reactive ion etching.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> As a result, chemically degradable BCPs have drawn intense attention for the preparation of nanoporous polymers. Also, polylactide-containing BCPs such as polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(<span class="small_caps">D</span>,<span class="small_caps">L</span>-lactide) (PS-PLA)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> and polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(<span class="small_caps">L</span>-lactide) (PS-PLLA)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> are highly suitable for the fabrication of nanoporous polymers because of the unstable character of the ester group in the polylactides, which can be hydrolytically degenerated. Most interestingly, nanoporous polymers with well-ordered nanochannels can be used as organic templates (in particular, polymeric templates) for templated synthesis. In this review, we review the development of template-based synthetic strategies using BCP as templates through different templated approaches, including the sol–gel reaction,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24–26</span></sup></a> electrochemical deposition,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27–32</span></sup></a> electroless plating,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33–37</span></sup></a> and atomic layer deposition (ALD).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38,39</span></sup></a> Chemical reactions can be carried out within the well-defined nanochannels of BCP templates for the fabrication of nanostructured inorganic materials to give nanohybrids with well-ordered structures.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">For the fabrication of 3D nanohybrids with complex-ordered structures and self-supporting nanoporous materials, a double gyroid (DG) (composed of a matrix and two continuous interpenetrating, but independent networks in 3D space) from the self-assembly of BCPs is especially appealing. The basic shape of the gyroid is a three-fold junction of three arms, in which each arm is connected to another set of three arms that are each themselves rotated to form a 3D network.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40,41</span></sup></a> After selective degradation of the minor phase, the DG nanostructure can be exploited to create fully interconnected nanochannels, leading to a great potential for the fabrication of inorganic network nanostructures from different templated synthesis, as illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a> For templated electroplating, the fabrication of metal-based and ceramic-based nanomaterials, and even semi-conductive nanomaterials with gyroid-forming morphologies, is feasible, while the templates can be easily deposited on conductive substrates. In contrast to the templated electroplating, templated electroless plating is not necessary to apply the electric field for the reduction of metal ions, giving the formation of a variety of metallic materials through nucleation and growth processes, and also providing the feasibility to fabricate micrometer particles with nanoporous textures and multibranched metallic materials. The templated sol–gel reaction is a very comprehensive method for fabricating a variety of ceramic nanomaterials, because of the sophisticated development in sol–gel science (with many recipes now available for the sol–gel reaction). In the case of templated ALD, with an appropriate control of the diffusion problem for the precursors, it is highly possible to fabricate tubular and even core–shell textures, due to the controllable deposition rate from the reaction cycles. Consequently, free-standing, well-ordered nanoporous inorganics with specific functions for a broad range of appealing applications can be fabricated after removal of the polymer matrix from the fabricated organic–inorganic nanohybrids due to its self-supporting character.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">In this review, recent progress in the fabrication of nanohybrids and nanoporous materials employing BCPs as structure-directed agents is described, and the corresponding applications in photonics, optoelectronics, energy storage, catalysis, separation, and drug delivery will be highlighted. The review will begin with an introduction to the syntheses and characterization of nanoscale templates with well-ordered textures, in particular silica- and carbon-based mesoporous structures (Section 2). Subsequently, we present the thermodynamics of BCP self-assembly and demonstrate the temperature and composition windows to find the DG phase (Section 3). In particular, we introduce an approach to effectively create a DG from a specific helical phase (H* phase) in the self-assembly of BCP comprising chiral entities (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, chiral BCP (BCP*)).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42,43</span></sup></a> Moreover, by taking advantage of the degradable characteristics of polylactide-containing polymers, well-ordered nanoporous polymeric materials with regular nanochannels can be fabricated and can serve as templates for subsequent templated syntheses.

      <p class="otherpara">Despite these rapid advances, a long-term goal for the preparation of well-ordered nanohybrids and nanoporous materials remains the development of procedures that provide for a rational design of tailor-made structural nanopores and for the incorporation of customized functionalities, while still retaining sufficient framework stability. Another long standing challenge is to understand the confinement principles of BCP-directed templated syntheses, even right down to the molecular level. In addition, from an application point of view, the development of simple and scalable procedures for the construction of well-ordered porous materials with hierarchical structures at different organization levels is particularly appealing in many cases, since hierarchical pores are expected to synergistically exhibit the advantage of each class of pores. The final goal is to merge concepts and tools from different methodologies and complex components together for the development of well-ordered nanohybrids and nanoporous materials with innovative properties for targeting selected applications. These useful properties result from the effects of size and shape in the nanoscale, and due to the order and controlled orientation from the forming arrays, as well as the nanomaterials possessing appealing functions and complexity from their well-ordered structures and morphologies.</p>
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect364"><span class="a_heading">2. Templates for nanostructured materials</span></h2>
      <span>In the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been made towards the development of synthetic strategies for nanomaterials with well-defined size, shape and spatial arrangement of the constituent components. As described in Section 1, the synthesis of nanomaterials using templates is one of the most convenient and effective methods, in particular for manufacturing well-ordered nanostructured materials. On the basis of the approaches taken to achieve templated synthesis, the utilized templates can be classified into hard or soft templates, where templated synthesis by the deposition of desired materials into pre-prepared templates is referred to as hard templating, and using amphiphilic molecules containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains as templates for directing synthesis is referred to as soft templating. In contrast to the use of soft templates, such as surfactants as structure-directed agents, hard templating is straightforward, and usually involves the following steps: (1) preparation of the template, (2) directed synthesis of the target materials by using the template, and (3) removal of the template. As a result, by taking advantage of the directed synthesis from pre-formed templates, it is much easier to control the templated morphologies and also the fabrication of ordered nanomaterials with orientation control in a large area (namely, it is an effective approach toward achieving a high degree of synthetic control). There are many excellent reviews with respect to the fabrication of hard templates.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57,58</span></sup></a> In this review article, we focus on the introduction of well-ordered nanostructured materials using hard templates for templated synthesis. For the synthesis of target materials, synthetic strategies based on physical templates include a variety of methods, such as surface coating and channel replication. By contrast, for the use of chemical templates, the synthesis is templated through chemical transformations, including the addition, substitution, and elimination of chemical species. As a result, nearly all kinds of materials can be utilized—from metals, semiconductors and ceramics to polymers—to form hierarchical nanostructures as templates. For removal of the template after synthesis, both physical methods, including dissolution, and chemical methods including calcination and etching, can be applied according to the nature of the templates, as long as the physical and chemical properties of the resultant materials can be preserved. As a result, how to obtain well-defined nanoporous materials as templates is the first issue. In this section, the fabrication of templates will be introduced in accordance with their forming textures in dimension (Section 2.1 for zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles, 1D nanotubes, and 2D patterns; Section 2.2 for 3D textures, including non-ordered and ordered network structures). Moreover, on the basis of the chemical properties of the templates, the fabricated templates are simply divided into inorganic and organic templates. Special attention for the fabrication of inorganic templates will be focused on silica-based and carbon-based mesoporous materials (Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively). The fabrication of organic templates, in particular polymer templates, will be comprehensively reviewed in Section 3.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect369"><span class="b_heading">2.1 0D, 1D, and 2D nanostructures as templates</span></h3>
        <span>For hard templating, numerous materials and structures have been widely developed as templates. We can sort the templates into: 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanotubes, nanowires, 2D membranes, and 3D hierarchical nanostructures, in accordance with their dimensional textures. The synthetic strategy of utilizing 0D nanoparticles as templates is to prepare colloidal nanoparticles as scaffolds first, and then to coat the resultant materials on the surface of nanoparticle. After removal of the templates by calcination or chemical etching, hollow and spherical nanoparticles can be obtained. In general, materials with 0D spherical nanoparticles as templates can be divided into silicon oxide and polymers. Stöber and co-workers first demonstrated that mono-dispersed silica particles with a uniform shape and size in the range of 50 to 2000 nm diameter can be fabricated under a sol–gel reaction with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as the precursor.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit59"><sup><span class="sup_ref">59</span></sup></a> During the sol–gel reaction process, the alkyl silicates are easily hydrolyzed and condensed to silicic acid with the ammonia in alcoholic solvents. Ammonia is used as a morphological catalyst to form the spherical silicon oxide. Subsequently, uniform spherical silica with a smaller size ranging from 10 nm to 40 nm can be made by tuning the hydrolysis rate by adding basic amino acid <span class="small_caps">L</span>-lysine.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60</span></sup></a> Mono-dispersed polymer nanoparticles can also be used as colloidal templates, such as polystyrene (PS)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62,63</span></sup></a> Those nanoparticles are ordinarily made by emulsion polymerization, and the particle size is in the range of 100 nm to several microns. The emulsion of the monomers in solvent and polymerization are initiated by free radicals with the surfactants and aggregate to form the spherical shape. The characteristics and applications of mono-dispersed nanoparticles with a uniform shape have been widely discussed in a number of excellent reviews, such as the one by Xia and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> With 0D nanoparticles as templates, the following step is the fabrication of nanohybrids by either physical or chemical approaches. The physical approaches can be classified according to the surface coatings on individual particles, coatings on colloidal assemblies, and channel replication in hollow or porous particles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a> For chemical approaches, the approach can be divided into four steps: isomerization, substitution, addition, and elimination. After the fabrication of nanohybrids and removal of the templates, hollow micro- and nanostructures with a spherical shape can be manufactured under templated synthesis. Caruso and co-workers reported that hollow silica and silica–polymer spheres can be synthesized by assembling silica nanoparticles and polymers on the surface of colloidal templates, followed by removal of the templates using calcination or exposure to solvents. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5a and b</a> show 0D nanoparticles coated with SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) layers and hollow silica spheres fabricated by calcination.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> There are numerous articles published with respect to this approach, and several review articles excellently cover it.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65,67,68</span></sup></a> In the field of 1D nanostructures as templates, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires and carbon nanotubes are commonly used as templates to synthesize other nanomaterials.

On the basis of different thicknesses, carbon nanotubes can be divided into multi-walled and single-walled nanotubes. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were characterized in 1991 at an atom-based resolution as having a concentric arrangement of numerous cylinders with diameters up to 100 nm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> Afterwards, single-walled nanotubes were also synthesized and showed the simplest geometry rolled up with one single grapheme sheet.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77,78</span></sup></a> Owing to the diverse uses of carbon-based materials, several articles about carbon nanotubes have been published.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79,80</span></sup></a> With 1D nanotubes and nanowires as templates, templated synthesis can be utilized to produce 1D nanostructures based on different materials.

However, the random tracks on the polymeric membranes could result in shortcomings, such as heterogeneity and non-uniform dimensions. As a result, AAO membranes made by the anodization of aluminum metal are now more frequently used as templates to synthesize 1D nanotubes or nanowires, due to the uniform cylindrical shape and tunable diameter. AAO membranes are usually made by electrochemical reaction with the aluminum metal.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> Masuda and co-workers reported a two-step anodization approach to synthesize well-ordered AAO membranes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84</span></sup></a> High purity aluminum is dipped in the electropolishing solution to form a smooth and shiny aluminum after removal of the aluminum oxide on the surface.

Afterwards, the aluminum is immersed in acidic electrolyte condition once again for the second anodization. After removal of the aluminum, AAO membranes with cylindrical and uniform pores arranged hexagonally in high regularity can be obtained.

        <h3 id="sect427"><span class="b_heading">2.2 3D nanoporous materials</span></h3>
        <span>As described in Section 2.1, 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, nanotubes, and 2D nanostructures have been widely studied. However, the limited specific area reduces their development in applications such as catalysis, drug delivery, and separation. In the classification of nanomaterials, 3D nanoporous materials show the higher porosity and have a larger specific surface area compared to the others. Due to this superiority, 3D nanoporous materials attract tremendous attention for scientists. With the successful results of fabricating 0D, 1D, and 2D nanostructures <span class="italic">via</span> templating, scientists have started to focus on the fabrication of 3D nanoporous materials. The 3D nanoporous materials can be divided into disordered and well-ordered nanostructures. For the fabrication of disordered 3D nanoporous materials, many approaches have been discussed. In particular, disordered bicontinuous nanoporous materials can be produced by templating. This class of porous material has been investigated rather extensively, and carries many of the advantages of the ordered morphologies without the constraints associated with aligning cylinders or hitting the restricted regions where the ordered morphologies are found from the self-assembly. A comprehensive introduction, in particular covering the ones produced from the self-assembly of block copolymers, is given in Section 3.3. In contrast to disordered 3D nanoporous materials, well-ordered 3D nanoporous materials possess the benefits of uniform pore size and high isotropic percolation due to their ordered periodicities. By taking advantage of their well-defined texture, ordered 3D nanoporous materials show great superiority in optical applications, in which the interactions of an incident electromagnetic wave, such as visible light, and the ordered structure give rise to specific and unique optical activities, such as destructive and constructive interference, and corresponding photonic properties. For the fabrication of well-ordered 3D nanoporous materials, there are two types of templates: organic and inorganic templates. There are many approaches to manufacture organic templates, in particular polymer templates from both top-down and bottom-up methods. One of the most popular methods is to acquire the well-ordered polymer templates from the self-assembly of block copolymers, and for this, a comprehensive introduction with respect to the fabrication of polymer templates from degradable block copolymers is given in Section 3. In contrast to organic templates, inorganic templates are usually made of silicon and carbon. There have been many comprehensive reviews carried out in recent years.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89–94</span></sup></a> In fact, silica-based and carbon-based porous materials have made a tremendous contribution to this field. The fabrication of silica-based and carbon-based porous materials is described in detail in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. It is also noted that ordered 3D nanoporous materials can be fabricated by an inverse-opal approach. In nature, opal is a colorful gemstone made from silicon oxide. The structure of opal is formed by a periodic arrangement of spherical silicon oxide with cubic-close-packing, and the brilliant color is attributed to the photonic effect with well-ordered structures. In addition to using soft or hard templating processes to synthesize the well-ordered 3D nanoporous templates, colloidal nanoparticle arraying, like with gemstone opal, can also be used to give well-ordered 3D nanoporous materials as templates. In this synthetic strategy, one of the advantages of the arrangement of spherical nanoparticle to form the well-ordered 3D template is that numerous templates can be made by tuning the size and choosing the species of the colloidal nanoparticles. Basically, spherical nanoparticles need to be prepared first for this process. As mentioned in Section 2.1, mono-dispersed colloidal silica, PS, PMMA and p(St-MMA-AA) can be synthesized by the Stöber method. Subsequently, mono-dispersed nanoparticles may assemble in a close-packed arrangement, giving 3D colloidal templates. Several methods of arraying to the 3D structures, including centrifugation, sedimentation of a suspension of colloidal spheres, filtration, vertical deposition, and assembly in confinement, have been widely reported and many excellent reviews have been published.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64,95–98</span></sup></a> After successfully manufacturing well-ordered 3D colloidal templates, the next step is the templated synthesis. Under templated synthesis, the precursor materials can be filled into the interstitial space between the colloidal nanoparticles, which thus act as templates. After chemical or physical transformation from the precursors to the resultant products, well-ordered 3D nanoporous materials, which are also termed inverse opals, can be obtained.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> With well-ordered 3D nanostructures, nanomaterials made by colloidal templates find uses in numerous applications, including in sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, catalysis, sorption, thermal insulation, surfaces with special wetting properties, and in photonic devices, especially.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a></span>

An evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) process is typically involved in the surfactant templating process for the synthesis of mesoporous materials with ordered textures and controlled orientation. This route is especially suitable for the fabrication of silica-based mesoporous materials, because of its easy control of the hydrolysis and condensation rates by adjusting the reaction parameters, such as the pH value and temperature.

Surfactants commonly used in the synthesis of the ordered mesoporous silica are frequently classified on the basis of the nature of the interaction between the polar group of the surfactant and the hydrolyzed silica precursor. A cationic surfactant is an efficient directing agent, due to the strong ionic interaction between its cationic head group and the negatively charged silica precursor under basic conditions. After the successful synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica using a quaternary cationic surfactant, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, C<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>H<small><sub>2<span class="italic">n</span>+1</sub></small>N(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>Br, various silica-based mesostructures have been synthesized using gemini, bolaform, and fluorinated surfactants. Stabilization of the hybrid interface can also be achieved through the formation of H-bonds between silicic acid and the ether oxygen of a polyethylene oxide (PEO) chain of nonionic surfactants. The higher molecular weight and the wide variability in size, as well as the composition of surfactants, including commercial oligomeric acid alkyl-PEO, alkyl-phenol-PEO, sorbitan ester, and PEO-based BCPs, provide an opportunity to tune the accessible pore size in a large range and in a wide variety of mesopore structures.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect484"><span class="b_heading">2.4 Carbon-based mesoporous materials</span></h3>
        <span>Carbon-based mesoporous materials have been widely studied because of their versatile and powerful properties, such as hydrophobicity, high corrosion resistance, and superior thermal and mechanical stabilities. Consequently, carbon-based mesoporous materials have been used in applications such as gas separation, water purification, and as catalyst supports and electrodes for electrochemical double layer capacitors, as well as in fuel cells. In the early years, carbon-based mesoporous materials with disordered structures were manufactured through controlling the pyrolysis of carbon precursors. For homogeneous properties in practical applications, carbon-based mesoporous materials with controlled surface properties and structural ordering were required. One easy approach to fabricate well-ordered porous carbon is by using porous materials with ordered and specific morphologies as templates, which is in effect hard templating, as described previously. Over the last ten years, many kinds of rigid and newly designed inorganic templates with well-defined structures have been employed in an attempt to synthesize carbons with uniform pore sizes and shapes. A variety of inorganic materials, including silica nanoparticles, zeolites, AAO membranes, and silica-based mesoporous materials, have been used as templates. As a result, well-defined carbon-based mesoporous materials with uniform pore sizes and shapes can be synthesized by using well-defined silica-based mesoporous materials as templates.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89,92</span></sup></a> Ryoo and co-workers successfully fabricated ordered carbon-based mesoporous materials labeled as “CMK series” by using silica-based mesoporous materials (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, MCM-48) as hard templates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a><a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8</a> shows the process, which utilizes silica-based nanomaterials MCM-48 as a template and sucrose as the carbon source to manufacture carbon-based nanomaterials through templated synthesis.

        <p class="otherpara">Although mesoporous carbon materials with high-order structures can be successfully fabricated, many obstacles and disadvantages are encountered when the mesoporous carbon materials are synthesized <span class="italic">via</span> hard templating. For instance, not only are the pores of the mesoporous carbon synthesized from the hard templating usually wider than the pores with silica templates, but also the templating process is too expensive and complex. Due to these shortcomings, an easier and low-cost method to fabricate carbon-based mesoporous materials has been developed. By combining the self-assembly of BCPs and carbonation of carbon precursors, carbon-based mesoporous materials can be directly fabricated. Zhao and co-workers reported on a new approach to synthesize ordered and rigid mesoporous carbon using amphiphilic triblock copolymers for solvent evaporation induced self-assembly, as illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9</a>. The synthesis is carried out using amphiphilic triblock copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide)-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(propylene oxide)-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO–PPO–PEO),and a low-molecular weight phenol polymer and formaldehyde as the precursors for the formation of well-ordered structures with specific morphologies <span class="italic">via</span> EISA.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> As shown, the mechanism for forming the well-ordered mesoporous carbon relies on the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl group of the resol and the PEO–PPO–PEO for self-assembly. The thermopolymerization of resol at low temperatures in the presence of the triblock copolymer can yield a rigid zeolite-like hydrocarbon network with three-connected benzene rings, resulting from the covalent bonding formation, giving the polymers the required stability to direct the transformation to homologous carbon frameworks by carbonization under nitrogen. After the thermopolymerization, the surfactants can be removed by solvent-extraction-assisted oxidation or heating under nitrogen, leading to the formation of well-defined mesoporous polymers with large uniform mesopores, surface areas, and pore volumes for the subsequent carbonization. Furthermore, the mesostructures can be synthesized from 2D hexagonal (<span class="italic">p</span>6<span class="italic">m</span>), to 3D caged cubic (<span class="italic">Im</span><img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_0033_0304.gif" alt="[3 with combining macron]"/><span class="italic">m</span>) with a triblock copolymer (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, F127 (EO106PO70 EO106)), or a lamellar morphology with a triblock copolymer (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, P123 (EO<small><sub>20</sub></small>PO<small><sub>70</sub></small> EO<small><sub>20</sub></small>)) by simply adjusting the mass ratio of the polymer precursors and the amphiphilic surfactants or by choosing different surfactants.

      <h2 id="sect515"><span class="a_heading">3. Nanoporous materials from block copolymer self-assembly</span></h2>
      <span>Self-assembly is a spontaneous association of molecules under equilibrium conditions into stable, well-defined aggregates by secondary interactions (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, non-covalent forces). In 1985, Lehn reported that supramolecular chemistry is based on molecular interactions, that is, the associations of two or more chemical entities and their corresponding intermolecular forces.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> Molecular interactions are essential in biological systems, such as for an enzyme or a receptor binding to a substrate, the self-assembly of protein complexes, the intermolecular reading of genetic code, neurotransmitter-induced signals, and cellular recognitions. By manipulating the energetic and stereochemical features of the non-covalent forces within a defined molecular architecture, the designed receptor molecules are capable of binding substrate species strongly and selectively, thus forming well-defined structures with specific functions. In 2002, Whitesides described self-assembly as a process in which either separated or linked components can autonomously form ordered aggregates without human intervention.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> Self-assembly can be carried out with components having sizes from the molecular (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, crystals) to macroscopic levels (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, weather systems), providing tractable conditions for many applications and intense research investigations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> Self-assembly occurs when molecules interact with one another through a balance of attractive and repulsive interactions. In comparison with thermal energies, these interactions are usually weak and non-covalent, such as van der Waal forces, Coulomb interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and relatively weak covalent bonding (coordination bonding). Among the self-assembly of synthetic molecules, the self-assembly of BCPs has been extensively studied, because of their fascinating phase behaviors and nanostructured phases. In this section, we give a brief introduction to the self-assembly of BCPs in bulk (Section 3.1) and in the thin-film state (Section 3.2). Special attention will be paid to the self-assembly of chiral BCPs (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, BCP*s consisting of chiral polymers as building blocks). Owing to the chirality effect on BCP self-assembly, a metastable helical phase can be formed, giving a wide range for the formation of DG in the phase diagram of BCPs*, which is attributed to the easy path for the order-order transition from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional (network) structure. Because of the unique morphological texture of the DG, with well-defined, interconnected, and self-supporting characters, DG can be used as a perfect texture for the fabrication of nanoporous materials. After the introduction of BCP self-assembly, we focus on the fabrication of nanoporous polymers from different approaches using BCP self-assembly. The approaches will be simply divided by the fabrication of nanoporous polymers using solvents for the dissolution of the constituent components to create the pore structures or for evaporation-induced pore formation in BCP systems (Section 3.3), using degradable BCPs for structure formation, followed by degeneration of the constituent components in BCP to give well-ordered nanoporous textures (Section 3.4).</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect526"><span class="b_heading">3.1 General principles of block copolymer self-assembly</span></h3>
        <span>BCPs comprising chemically distinct polymer chains covalently linked together are promising for the design of nanostructures. Owing to their mutual repulsive forces, dissimilar blocks tend to segregate into different domains. Also, the chemically connected polymer chains are stretched away from each other to reduce the interfacial energy. Therefore, area minimization at the interface (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, <span class="italic">via</span> an inter-material dividing surface) of two blocks occurs in order to attain a lower enthalpy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> However, this is unfavorable for the entropic penalty, since the polymer chains prefer a random coil shape. Accordingly, nanoscale structures of microphase separation can be formed from the self-assembly of BCPs, because the size of the segregated microdomains is limited by the constraint of the chemical linkage of the blocks with nanoscale chain dimensions. The resulting microphase-separated nanostructure is thus the consequence of a balance between the enthalpy of the interfacial area and the entropy of the polymer chains.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Considering these competing effects, self-organized periodic microstructures can emerge on a nanoscopic scale. Various nanostructures can be observed, depending on the relative volume ratio between the blocks, the sequences of the copolymer and the architecture of the polymer chains, as well as on the persistence lengths of the blocks. In the case of a non-crystalline flexible coil AB diblock copolymer, the composition of the AB diblock (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the volume fraction of block A (<span class="italic">f</span><small><sup>v</sup></small><small><sub>A</sub></small>)) controls the geometry of the nanostructures. In <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10</a>, for nearly symmetric diblocks (<span class="italic">f</span><small><sup>v</sup></small><small><sub>A</sub></small> ∼ 0.5), a lamellar phase forms. For moderate compositional asymmetries, a complex bicontinuous phase with a cubic symmetry, known as a double gyroid (DG) phase, has been observed, in which the minority component forms dispersive microdomains, consisting of two interweaving threefold coordinated networks.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16,17</span></sup></a> However, at a higher compositional asymmetry, the minority component forms hexagonally packed cylinders, and then the spheres are arranged on a body-centered cubic lattice (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, in a sphere). Eventually, as <span class="italic">f</span><small><sup>v</sup></small><small><sub>A</sub></small> becomes closer to 0 or 1, a homogeneous phase is obtained. As a result, self-assembled 1D, 2D, and 3D periodic nanostructures that are lamellae, DG, cylinders, or spheres in bulk have been demonstrated within the full composition range. Consequently, BCP microphase separation for sizes from tens to hundreds of nanometers is applicable to many appealing nanotechnologies. These variable textures of microphase-separated nanostructures can be easily tailored by the molecular engineering of synthetic BCPs, and appear to have promise in applications in nanotechnologies, especially in thin-film technologies such as nanoporous membranes, templates for the fabrication of inorganic materials in various shapes, organic–inorganic hybrids, and in nanopatterned masks for high density information storage media.</p>

Recently, by taking advantage of the chirality effect on BCP self-assembly, Ho and co-workers demonstrated the fabrication of fascinating helical nanostructures with an ordered packing in bulk for the first time.

        <p class="otherpara">The chirality effect not only gives rise to the formation of helical chains (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, an intramolecular effect) but also induces the formation of partially ordered microdomains (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, intermolecular interaction). The driving force for the formation of the partially ordered microdomain is attributed to the mutual interaction of the chiral polymer chains with a helical conformation (namely, chiral interactions). The chiral PLLA chain with a helical conformation and long persistence length provides a specific geometrical property (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, helical steric hindrance) for self-assembly. In the self-assembly of BCPs, the incompatibility between chemically connected PLLA and the PS blocks gives rise to a strongly repulsive force, which reinforces the stretching of the polymer chains and stabilizes the helical conformation. This is similar to the transferred mechanism from a molecular chirality to a hierarchical chirality in the self-assembly of chiral lipid bilayer molecules. The chirality effect is considered to be the main ingredient for the formation of helical phases. Based on energetic considerations, the helical steric hindrance gives rise to the twisting and shifting of the bilayer-like nanostructure, so as to create a helical curvature at the interface. Furthermore, the chirality effect is enhanced by the introduction of the incompatible PS block, which intensifies with the helical steric hindrance effect and promotes the formation of helical microdomains. As a result, twisting and shifting at the microphase-separated interface is initiated by the helical steric hindrance and is amplified by the incompatible PS block and the further organization of the partially ordered microdomains due to the chiral interaction, ultimately leading to development of the helical microdomains. The suggested twisting and shifting mechanism in the self-assembly of the BCPs* was further evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence experiments. A series of polylactide-containing BCPs with an achiral perylene moiety as a chemical junction was synthesized, and then examined by CD and fluorescence experiments. Significant induced CD (ICD) signals and a bathochromic shift of the fluorescence emission for the achiral perylene moiety as a chemical junction of the BCPs* was found only when the concentration of the BCPs* in toluene solution was higher than the critical micelle concentration. As a result, it is suggested that the optical activity of the ICD for the perylene moiety as a chemical junction in the BCP* can be directed by the helicity of the chiral entity in the polylactide-containing BCP*. The twisting and shifting mechanism thus leads to formation of the H* phase in the enantiomeric polylactide-containing BCPs* from self-assembly and also decides the handedness of forming an H* phase by stacking the chiral polymer chains in a preferred direction along the central axis of the nanohelix, giving the nanohelix a preferential handedness. Accordingly, homochiral evolution from molecular chirality to phase chirality can be demonstrated in the self-assembly of the enantiomeric polylactide-containing BCPs* <span class="italic">via</span> the twisting and shifting mechanism.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Most interestingly, phase transition from the H* phase to other stable phases can be found after long-term annealing. Indeed, thermally induced phase transitions between equilibrium morphologies in BCP self-assembly are well known by varying the <span class="italic">χ</span> value (1/<span class="italic">T</span>) at an essentially constant BCP composition. A metastable perforated layered phase can also be transformed into stable phases through thermal annealing,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> revealing that the metastability of these self-assembled phases is promising in morphological manipulation. Similar to the transitions in the perforated layered phase, phase transitions from the H* phase to the stable cylinder phase were found after long-term thermal annealing, suggesting that the formation of an H* phase involves a long-lived metastable phase.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> Also, apart from the phase transition upon thermal annealing, the formation of the DG phase from the H* phase can also be achieved by controlling the solvent evaporation through a nucleation and growth process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12a</a>, a duplex phase containing PLLA helices (see the lower right in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12a</a>) and PLLA G networks (see the upper left in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12a</a>) in a PS matrix can be found under TEM observation. The relative geometric arrangement in the 3D space of the H* phase and DG phase is illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12b</a>. The geometries of (110)<small><sub>H*</sub></small> → (211)<small><sub>G</sub></small> and (100)<small><sub>H*</sub></small> → (220)<small><sub>G</sub></small>, resulting from the phase transition with the corresponding length scale and unit cell, can thus be well-defined by investigations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a> Note that the formation of the DG phase is usually limited to a narrow composition region in a weakly segregated condition. The formation of the DG in the intermediate and the strong segregation result from the H* through an order-order transition at which the H* in the PS-PLLA is a metastable phase, and appears in a relatively wide region in an intermediate to strong segregation, due to the slow kinetics associated with long, highly entangled chains. By taking advantage of the H* → DG, the DG-forming temperature window can be enlarged in the phase diagram of PS-PLLA, due to the formation of the H*. As a result, the reasons why the DG-forming region can be enlarged by the formation of H* need to be elucidated. At the microscopic level, the packing energy of the polymer chains strongly depends on the rigidity of the chain conformation, which is related to its persistence length. As the persistence length of the polymer chain increases, the packing energy decreases. As calculated from theoretical predictions, the persistence length of the chiral PLLA chain (11.9 angstroms) is larger than that of the racemic PLA chain (10.6 angstroms).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> The larger persistence length for the chiral PLLA chain is attributed to the formation of a helical chain conformation for a chiral polymer chain. Consequently, a self-assembled phase with a lower packing energy can be achieved, due to the highly oriented chains at the interface that lower the packing enthalpy (step 1 in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12c</a>). Moreover, the packing frustration can be alleviated, resulting from the longer persistence length of the PLLA helical chain conformation than the racemic polymer that can sustain excessive stretching for PLLA blocks oriented towards the center of DG nodes without chain stretching to reduce the entropic penalty (step 3 in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12c</a>). At the mesoscopic level, we speculate that H* can serve as a stepping stone with a helical twisting locus due to matching of the geometric dimensions (step 2 in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12c</a>). For the order-order transition from hexagonally packed cylinders (HC) to DG, the transition is initiated by the formation of one fivefold junction that pinches off, thus breaking a cylinder and leaving a threefold junction (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, interconnection of the middle cylinder with the neighboring three cylinder). The two free ends of the cylinder are highly unfavorable and quickly form two fourfold junctions that then each break off producing a threefold junction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> As the process repeats, HC evolves into DG. By contrast, in the case of the order–order transition from H* to DG, the formation of H* facilitates the easier interconnection from a 2D to a 3D network, due to the 2D geometry having a helical twisting locus, which is similar to the reduction of the activation energy barrier by catalysts. Also, the helical locus not only provides a lower packing enthalpy due to the enhancement of the incompatibility between the PS and PLLA polymer chains, but it also incurs a lower entropic penalty, due to the convenient chain packing without extension of the polymer chain, thus providing an easy path for interconnecting 2D arrays to 3D networks to form the DG phase. As a result, by taking advantage of the easy path for H* → DG, the DG-forming temperature window in the phase diagram can be enlarged, due to the lower Gibbs free energy with the helical conformation, thermodynamically, and the lower energy barrier for the H* → DG, kinetically. Consequently, a wide region for the formation of DG can be found in the phase diagram of the BCPs*, suggesting that the helical phase (H*) from the self-assembly of BCPs* can serve as a stepping stone for the formation of the DG, due to it creating an easy path for the order–order transition from a two-dimensional to three-dimensional (network) structure.</p>

        <span>Well-defined nanostructured phases can be tailored by the molecular engineering of synthetic BCPs to obtain promising features for applications in nanotechnologies. To extend their applications, nanostructured thin films with controllable orientation and thickness over a large area are required. Accordingly, different approaches for controlling the orientation of microphase-separated nanostructures from the self-assembly of BCPs have been developed. These approaches include solvent evaporation,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> solvent annealing,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> the application of shear fields,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> the application of electric fields,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> the use of temperature gradients,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> epitaxial crystallization,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> chemical patterning of the surface,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132–136</span></sup></a> and graphoepitaxy.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">137,138</span></sup></a> Solvent field (that is, solvent evaporation or solvent annealing) has proven to be a very simple, highly effective method to manipulate the orientation and lateral ordering of BCP microdomains in the thin-film state. Libera and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> were the first to demonstrate the effect of solvent evaporation on the orientation of cylindrical microdomains normal to the film surface in a range of different BCP thin films. Slow solvent extraction rates lead to a parallel alignment of the cylindrical microdomains in BCP thin films. Upon fast drying, a perpendicular orientation of the cylinders can be observed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">139</span></sup></a> The microphase separation is initiated from the air surface, at which the formed morphology adopts a perpendicular orientation due to permeation considerations, in particular due to the permeation of solvent at the surface. Following the nucleation of a microphase separation, the solvent molecules are evaporated through the higher permeation microdomains to create a solvent concentration gradient within the film. The development of a perpendicular morphology continuously proceeds from the free surface, due to the epitaxy-like growth through the entire film. The solvent concentration gradient will be subtle under conditions in which the solvent is allowed to evaporate relatively fast. However, eventually, straight perpendicular cylinders in the films will be formed from the top to the bottom in the direction of the maximum solvent concentration gradient. In contrast to the kinetics approach described above, which results in metastable thin-film morphologies, the phase behaviors of thin-film BCPs have been extensively studied to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium morphologies that can avoid the need for a phase transformation in further thermal treatments. The phase behavior of BCPs in thin films is known to deviate from the bulk behavior, since it is influenced by the interfacial interactions (with the substrate and/or air surface) of the block components and the thickness confinement of the thin film (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the commensuration of the interdomain spacing of the nanostructures).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">140</span></sup></a> Magerle and co-workers presented a thermodynamic phase diagram for a cylinder-forming polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-polybutadiene-<span class="italic">b</span>-polystyrene (SBS) triblock copolymer in thin films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141</span></sup></a> The TappingMode™ scanning force microscopy (TM-SFM) phase images of two annealed SBS films with different initial film thicknesses are shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig13">Fig. 13a and b</a>. With experiments and by computer simulations based on dynamic density functional theory (DDFT), the phase behavior in the thin film of cylinder-forming BCP can be seen to be dominated by surface reconstructions, and it can be seen that the morphologies change as a function of the gradually changing film thickness. Deviations from the bulk structure, such as a wetting layer, perforated lamellae, and lamellae are identified after surface reconstructions, and result from the interplay between the surface fields and confinement effects (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig13">Fig. 13c</a>).</span>

        <p class="otherpara">The substrate surface energy and surface chemistry are important parameters for controlling BCP thin film self-assembly, both with regard to nanostructure stability and nanostructure orientation. Preferential surfaces are wetted by the preferred block, whereas neutral surfaces encourage the presence of all blocks at the surface. For the substrate effects, the substrate surface energy/chemistry effect can be generally viewed as a field that propagates from the substrate surface into the film. The propagation distance depends on the relative strength of the field (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the strength of the interactions between the substrate and polymer film), the competing interactions from the air surface, and the energetics of the equilibrium bulk morphology. By contrast, the surface preferentiality at the air surface is a similar field effect (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, air surface effects) to that emanating from the substrate surface, with preferential and neutral interactions affecting both the orientation and stability of the nanostructure. Because the air surface is a “soft” interface, surface preferentiality is partially governed by the surface tensions of the copolymer blocks, with the lower surface tension block preferentially segregating to the free surface. Additionally, this surface property can be tuned by thermal annealing. For example, an effectively neutral air surface can be created in the PS-PMMA system by annealing films between ≈170 °C to 230 °C, where the block surface tensions are approximately equal. Unfortunately, many copolymers contain blocks with very dissimilar surface tensions or blocks that are susceptible to thermal degradation. For these systems, solvent annealing provides an attractive alternative to thermal annealing. Moreover, BCP thin films are typically subjected to a significant degree of confinement, with film thicknesses comparable to the interdomain spacing of nanostructures. Because the stretching or compression of polymer chains due to confinement is energetically unfavorable, BCPs self-assemble into morphologies that relieve the stretching/compression or that mitigate the entropic penalty with favorable enthalpic interactions at the substrate or at the free surface. Two major categories of confinement can be defined for substrate-supported BCP thin films: hard confinement, which describes a film confined between two rigid interfaces, and soft confinement, which refers to a film where one interface (air surface) is in direct contact with the atmosphere. Therefore, controlling the surface and thickness effects on the self-assembly of BCP thin films can become a critical issue to obtain a BCP thin film with aligned nanostructures. Gopalan and co-workers demonstrated the induction of perpendicularly oriented cylinders in polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-PMMA) BCP films thicker than 100 nm by thermally annealing on a substrate modified with a random copolymer to give a neutral substrate for induced orientation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> The effects of the BCP film thickness, the annealing temperature, and the composition of the substrate-modifying random copolymer on the morphology of PMMA cylinder-forming PS-PMMA were studied. For BCP films thicker than 100 nm (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 300 nm), the fabrication of perpendicular PMMA cylinders is highly dependent upon both the substrate-modifying random copolymer and the annealing temperature, as these two parameters control the interactions of the BCP with the substrate and the free surface, respectively. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14a</a>, perpendicular cylinders in thicker films can be generated on the top surface when the BCP film thickness is increased to ∼300 nm and thermally annealed on a modified substrate.

Also, as the BCP film is thicker than 300 nm (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 500 nm), nucleation and growth of the microdomains proceed independently from each interface.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">In addition, to control the orientation of cylinder nanostructures, the long-range order of the cylinder arrays in the thin films of BCPs can also be important for applications that require addressability. Uncontrolled processes usually give rise to locally well-defined nanostructures, but grains of the microdomains are usually small and randomly arranged on the surface. Among the several plausible routes to enhance the lateral order in thin films of BCPs, annealing in solvent vapors has been shown to be effective in enhancing the lateral order over very large areas.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127,143</span></sup></a> Russell and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127,143</span></sup></a> investigated the thin-film morphologies of polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO) and polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-P4VP) after annealing in solvent vapors over different amounts of time. With increasing annealing time, the lateral ordering of the cylindrical nanostructures could be significantly increased. Consequently, BCP thin films with a hexagonal ordering of the cylindrical nanostructures could be achieved by vapor annealing. In our previous studies, the preparation of perpendicular PLLA cylinders in PS-PLLA thin film was achieved by controlling the evaporation rate of the solvent and the selectivity of the solvent with constituent blocks of the PS-PLLA (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, <span class="italic">via</span> a kinetics approach).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> In contrast to the kinetics approach, we also demonstrated a new thermodynamic method for the formation of well-defined nanostructured thin films from self-assembled PS-PLLA on Si wafers with a functionalized SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> surface.

Consequently, the neutral substrate could be used to enable the fabrication of truly film-spanning perpendicular cylinders in films using high temperature thermal treatment (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15a</a>). In addition, the perpendicular cylinders could be laterally ordered by further increasing the annealing temperature. Furthermore, we also demonstrated the fabrication of well-defined DG nanostructures with controlled thicknesses of ∼200 nm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145</span></sup></a> We showed that a neutral substrate could be prepared using a two-step grafting procedure through thermal annealing, under which PS-OH could be grafted onto a SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> surface, followed by the grafting of PLLA-OH. As a result, the controlled ordering of BCP DG thin films on a neutral substrate can be achieved by solvent annealing. A thin-film sample with a thermodynamically stable DG morphology will be formed using a non-preferential solvent. Consequently, DG thin film with the (211)<small><sub>DG</sub></small> plane parallel to the air surface and also to the functionalized substrate can be obtained, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15b</a>.

        <h3 id="sect693"><span class="b_heading">3.3 Nanoporous polymers from block copolymers</span></h3>
        <span>For applications in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, polymeric materials comprising two or more phases assembled in nanoscale structures play an important role in the development of new materials with novel properties. Among the varieties of phase morphologies from the assembled polymers, the 3D bicontinuous structure is the most distinctive arrangement, where each phase is independently continuous. If one of the phases is removed, the resultant material can be used to create nanoporous materials with 3D interconnected nanochannel with high porosity and a large specific surface area. Such nanoporous materials are key to many applications, for example, catalysis, separation technology, drug delivery, electronic devices, and energy storage (see Sections 4 and 5 for details). Accordingly, there is a strong motivation to develop new or improved strategies for the fabrication of nanoporous materials, in particular with well-defined pore sizes and shapes, and that is the major reason for the use of BCPs. For this purpose, interpenetrating 3D polymeric bicontinuous microemulsions with a characteristic length of around 100 nm through the ternary blends of two homopolymers and a diblock copolymer were developed. The phenomenon of the formation of bicontinuous microemulsions <span class="italic">via</span> blending was first discovered in mixtures of oil and water stabilized by surfactants.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit146"><sup><span class="sup_ref">146</span></sup></a> Bates and co-workers first demonstrated the existence of bicontinuous microemulsions in the BCP blends of polyethylene/poly(ethylene-<span class="italic">alt</span>-propylene)/poly(ethylene-<span class="italic">b</span>-ethylene-<span class="italic">alt</span>-propylene) (PE/PEP/PE–PEP blends).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">147</span></sup></a> They found that the capture of a polymeric bicontinuous microemulsion in a solid form is straightforward in principle, provided that the bicontinuous microemulsions channel intersects a solidification transition of one of the components in the blends. Subsequently, through a judicious selection of blending components, 3D continuous networks comprising a polymeric bicontinuous microemulsion were formed, and then could be removed by selective chemical or thermal means, giving a nanoporous polymer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit148"><sup><span class="sup_ref">148</span></sup></a> Similarly, a bicontinuous microemulsion in polystyrene/polyisoprene/polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-polyisoprene (PS/PI/PS–PI) blends could be obtained, and then trapped by vitrification of the PS domains. The resultant material was exposed to S<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> vapor to cross-link the PI domain, and then the PS homopolymer was removed by extraction with hexane (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17a</a>). As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17b and c</a>, a distinctive bicontinuous microemulsion structure can be retained and imprinted into the pore structure. As evidenced by nitrogen sorption measurements with a single peak centered at a pore diameter of 43 nm, the formed pore texture is continuous and uniform. Note that the copolymer is insoluble in the extracting solvent, and thus the PS block of the copolymer remains as a coating along the pore wall. As a result, polymeric bicontinuous microemulsion systems can be used as a nanocasting template, especially for the PE/PEP/PE–PEP system, because of its superior environmental resistance. Note that the choice of bicontinuous microemulsion systems as templates should be determined by several factors. First, that the polymers can be synthesized by a straightforward anionic polymerization/hydrogenation procedure and are stable indefinitely under ambient conditions. Also, the semicrystalline nature of PE should allow the bicontinuous microemulsion morphology to be captured in a solid material. Meanwhile, to convert a solidified bicontinuous microemulsion into a nanoporous material, the disparity in solubility between PE and PEP can be exploited to remove the latter from the structure. The remaining PE comprising the nanoporous material melts above around 100 °C and is insoluble in any liquid below 70 °C, providing sufficient robustness to the material for infiltration and conversion of the templated synthesis in the pores.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">149</span></sup></a></span>

Also, it is possible to obtain superior properties in practical applications; for instance, the short-range order of disorder bicontinuous nanoporous materials can be exploited as amorphous photonic crystals to give properties useful in photonic applications, such as broadband reflection and scattering enhanced light absorption, as well as high reflectance with angle independence.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit150"><sup><span class="sup_ref">150</span></sup></a> Although nanoporous polymers with short-range order can be easily formed through BCP blending followed by the solvation process for pore formation, the structures with only a short-range order might limit their applications.

        <p class="otherpara">Moreover, an interesting approach to create nanoporous polymers through the use of solvents was proposed by Abetz and co-workers. Instead of the induced orientation by solvent evaporation, the formation of a superstructure of a solution-cast BCP film was subjected to a non-solvent-induced phase separation before reaching the dried state, a procedure that is well-known as “phase inversion” in the field of membrane science.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152</span></sup></a> Note that the membranes used today are mainly manufactured by an isothermal phase-inversion process. However, in the process developed by Abetz and co-workers, a concentrated polymer solution (typical polymer concentration ranging from 12 wt% to 25 wt%) is immersed in a non-solvent bath, and a solvent-non-solvent exchange leads to their phase separation. The polymer-rich phase forms the porous matrix, while the polymer-poor phase gives rise to the pores. The formation of a dense surface with a porous structure beneath is favored by a significant concentration of a highly volatile solvent in the casting solution. When the phase-inversion process is carried out with a BCP, the porous structure can be formed as usual by a liquid–liquid demixing process. The surface can then further self-assemble into a well-ordered structure, as is typical for BCPs. After removal of the asymmetric film from the precipitation bath and then after drying, the self-assembled ordered textures are integrally supported by a mechanically stable and highly porous substructure. The critical parameters for control of the process are the composition of the casting solution, the evaporation time before precipitation, and the nature of the precipitation bath. Polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-P4VP) was used as the starting material. It is well known that PS-P2VP belongs to the class of non-ionic amphiphilic systems. P4VP is a hydrophilic polymer that dissolves only in dimethyl formamide (DMF), in lower alcohols, and in aqueous mineralic acids. On the other hand, the hydrophobic PS may be dissolved in a number of organic solvents, such as toluene, tetrahydrofurane (THF), or chloroform. As a result, the membrane-casting solvent is composed of DMF and THF. The addition of THF typically leads to membranes with a tighter or pore-free surface. Owing to the high evaporation rate of THF before immersion in the non-solvent (water), the polymer is enriched at the film surface. Also, the non-ordered graded porous structure typical for phase-inversion membranes is covered by a layer of 200–300 nm thickness of well-ordered cylindrical pores perpendicular to the film surface (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19a and b</a>). This asymmetric morphology is a direct consequence of the combination of two different processes: conventional non-solvent-induced phase separation and the self-assembly of BCPs. This work opens a new and facile way to generate porous materials with a cylindrical nanoporous thin film on the top of a macroporous texture that would be suitable for use in separating membranes.</p>

        <h3 id="sect744"><span class="b_heading">3.4 Nanoporous templates from degradable block copolymers</span></h3>
        <span>Well-ordered nanoporous polymers can be fabricated by using solvents for dissolution of the constituent components to create the pore structures or for evaporation-induced pore formation in BCP systems, as described above. The control of the intrinsic texture for a porous structure or for pore texture formation and the corresponding orientation, in particular in the thin-film state, may require dedicated approaches or processing. Moreover, the formation of well-defined 3D textures or porous textures remains challenging using BCP as structure-directing materials, since they strongly relies on the well-controlled kinetics process for microphase separation from sophisticated phase behaviors. Another approach is to use self-assembled morphologies directly from degradable BCPs, and then, by taking advantage of the degradable character, well-defined nanoporous polymers with various pore textures can be prepared, providing excellent templates for fabricating well-defined nanostructured materials through the templating process. Although, this approach will require additional efforts in searching appropriate methods for the removal of the degradable component, it is a much easier method to obtain a monolith or thin-film samples as precursors for the fabrication of well-defined nanoporous polymers with controlled shape and size, as well as the correct corresponding orientation. BCPs with aliphatic polyester blocks have attracted extensive attention in the preparation of nanoporous polymers, as the polyesters can be selectively degraded, particularly by hydrolysis due to the unstable character of the ester group. Accordingly, polyester-containing copolymers can form nanoporous materials by hydrolysis of the polyester blocks. Among these, polylactide-containing BCPs (such as PS-PLA and PS-PLLA) have drawn intense attention because the hydrolytic properties of polylactides and the reasonably high glass transition of the PS make the BCPs highly suited for the fabrication of nanoporous polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22,23</span></sup></a> The polylactides in the BCPs can be hydrolyzed in a base mixture of methanol, sodium hydroxide, and water at 65 °C (below the Tg of PS and above the Tg of PLA or PLLA). In this condition, the main-chain of PLA or PLLA is easily cleaved, and, furthermore, PS is both insoluble and inert. After the hydrolytic process, the sample is washed with water and methanol, and then dried under vacuum at room temperature. The fabrication of polymeric bulk monoliths with regular nanochannels can be achieved by the hydrolysis of PLA in the PS-PLA bulk state, as demonstrated by Hillmyer and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> Moreover, an interesting approach has been proposed for the preparation of robust nanoporous polymers with sub-10 nm pores from a microphase-separated bicontinuous PLA by combining polymerization-induced phase separation with <span class="italic">in situ</span> BCP formation and polymerization of a mixture of multifunctional monomers in the presence of a macromolecular chain transfer agent (macro-CTA) that is initially soluble in the monomer mixture but incompatible with the emergent cross-linked polymer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">154</span></sup></a> Because of the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization process, which allows for linear increases in the molar mass, the majority of the growing BCPs will reach the point of becoming incompatible in the polymerizing monomer medium and will then microphase-separate over a small time interval. As a result, a homogeneous cross-linked, mechanically robust, and nanostructured composite can be fabricated. Namely, the developed bicontinuous morphology is the result of the balance of microphase separation of the mixture into continuous domains of the degradable polymers and the emergent cross-linked polymers (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, from cross-linking polymerization induced microphase separation). Consequently, by taking advantage of a chemically degradable block as the macro-CTA, nanoporous monoliths with precise control over pore size distribution and mechanical integrity can be generated (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21</a>).</span>

Note that the gyroid structure is the most appealing morphology among all the nanostructures from the self-assembly of BCPs.

After selective degeneration of the minor phase in the polymer matrix, the materials can generate gyroid-forming interconnected nanochannels with high porosity and large specific surface area. Moreover, with control of the molecular weight for the BCPs used, the porosity and specific surface area of the nanoporous gyroid polymers can be adjusted, providing a platform technology for the fabrication of nanoporous polymers with a well-defined texture and controllable pore size, as well as a controlled orientation of the corresponding pore texture.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">In addition to the hydrolysis of polylactide-containing BCPs, many methods, such as the ozonolysis of polybutadiene-containing<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> and PI-containing BCPs<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33,155</span></sup></a> and the UV degradation of PMMA-containing BCPs,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> have been successfully developed for the formation of well-ordered nanoporous polymers, in particular in the thin-film state, in which the BCP can interact with a specific reagent to degenerate the sacrificial block for the formation of well-defined nanoporous polymers. Because ozone can attack the carbon–carbon double bonds predominantly, leading to the degeneration of PB or PI chains after ozone treatment, Register and co-workers first demonstrated ozone-degradable copolymer thin films with well-ordered spherical nanostructure for the nanolithography mask.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> Here, after a standard reactive ion etching (RIE) process, the spherical patterns could be transferred directly to the underlying silicon nitride layer, and periodic arrays of holes were produced on the silicon nitride-coated silicon wafer. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23a</a> shows an illustration of the manufacturing procedure, where nanoporous PS from PS–PB and PS–PI can be obtained after ozonization, and then used as a mask. In the protocol for preparing holes in a SiN substrate, a PS–PI or PS–PB BCP is spin-coated on a silicon nitride substrate and subsequently annealed. Consequently, the monolayers of BCPs form spherical inclusions of the PB block. After the ozonization process, the spherical BCP transfers to regular spherical voids in the PS matrix, hence leading to variations in the effective total thickness of the copolymer mask. The regions underneath the empty spheres are protected by a thinner PS mask than the rest of the area. Therefore, during the RIE process, the remaining region is still protected to produce holes in the silicon nitride. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23b</a> shows a TEM image of a PB spherical microdomain monolayer after ozonization, where the empty spheres appear lighter than the PS matrix, and <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23c</a> demonstrates the formation of hexagonal arrays of holes fabricated in silicon nitride from a copolymer film. To show the utility of the techniques for more practical lithographic processes, they further used a spherical-phase PS–PI, and spin-coated and processed the polymer films on a thick wafer. This technique allows one to depth-profile copolymer films with around 10 nm depth resolution. According to the film-processing steps discussed in their results, PI blocks behave similar to PB blocks. The PI blocks also wet the air and silicon nitride interfaces, and any selective processing performed on PS–PB films can also be performed on PS–PI films. The PI block can be etched after ozone degradation to act as a mask with a periodic arrangement of nanopores, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23d</a>. Subsequently, RIE with fluorocarbon-based plasma can be used, resulting in an anisotropic etching of the silicon nitride substrate. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23e</a> shows a SEM micrograph of periodic arrays of holes in a silicon nitride-covered silicon wafer fabricated. As a result, successful pattern transfer to silicon nitride is possible, because the etching rate of silicon nitride is faster than PS under the RIE conditions used above, resulting in the fabrication of nanostructures with an aspect ratio of around 1. Furthermore, if the etching rate of the substrate is increased relative to the rate of the polymer mask, the fabrication of features with higher aspect ratios would be possible for optoelectronics applications. This work opened up a new research area usually referred to as block copolymer lithography.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Recently, polymers composed of inorganic components (such as PDMS) have been extensively investigated because of their potential applications as etch-resistant materials for dry etching processes. The silicon-containing polymers can form a thin layer of silicon oxide under oxygen plasma treatment, which can resist further etching more than the other types of polymers that only contain C, H, N, and O atoms. As demonstrated by Thomas and co-workers, porous and relief ceramic nanostructures can be fabricated from the self-assembly of gyroid-forming BCP precursors through a one-step, low-temperature technique.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> The materials are triblock copolymers of the type ABA, where A is PI and B is poly(pentamethyldisilylstyrene) [P(PMDSS)]. After stronger oxidation conditions (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, UV-ozone) are applied for the oxidizing process, the PI is removed and the silicon in the P(PMDSS) can be converted to silicon oxycarbide, giving neither a nanoporous texture or nanorelief (3D connected strut networks), depending solely on the volume fraction of the hydrocarbon block relative to the silicon-containing block in the BCP precursor. The ceramic that forms after oxidation preferably exhibits high-temperature chemical and dimensional stability. Note that a range of pore sizes and specific areas can be obtained by varying the molecular weight to form a well-ordered nanoporous texture and nanorelief structures, thus presenting opportunities for use in separation, high-temperature catalysis applications, and low dielectric constant and photonic bandgap materials.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Afterwards, while the use of degradable BCPs has been commonly exploited for the fabrication of nanoporous polymers, the utilization of nanoporous thin films from BCP self-assembly in lithographic arenas (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, BCP lithography) has become a promising technology due to its potential to overcome the limitations of line definition and resolution in nano-microelectronic mechanical system (nano-MEMS) fabrication, and, in addition, is a focus of this review article for templated syntheses. As a result, the relevant work on BCP lithography is briefly summarized below. With the combination of BCP self-assembly and lithography, well-defined 2D and 3D nanostructured devices can be fabricated. To produce patterns useful for nanolithography, a value of <span class="italic">χN</span> considerably greater than the minimum is typically used to minimize intermixing, and this leads to a sharp interface between the blocks at which the interface width scales have a value of <span class="italic">χ</span><small><sup>−0.5</sup></small>. The total free energy per chain associated with the microphase separation, including both interfacial and strain contributions, can be expressed as a function of <span class="italic">χ</span> and <span class="italic">N</span>, so that the equilibrium period of the nanoscale patterns can be determined.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit156"><sup><span class="sup_ref">156</span></sup></a> The majority of work on 2D device fabrication using BCPs is based on BCP microdomain (or micelle) patterns formed by using a BCP thin film to serve the same function for a resist pattern produced by conventional exposure and development processes. In the conventional patterning process, the resist pattern is transferred to a functional material, and then the resulting structure can be planarized using a polished dielectric. 2D posts, holes, and lines at specific locations can be made by directing the self-assembly of BCPs through lithographically defined, sparse chemical and/or topographical templates. PS-PMMA, PS-PDMS, and PS-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(tertbutylacrylate) are common materials for BCP lithography. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25a</a> shows a magnetic 2D metallic pattern using a cylinder-forming PS-PMMA on a sparse chemical template.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> Various 2D patterns beyond gratings and close packed dots can be achieved by utilizing diverse combinations of BCP architectures, compositions, molecular weights, blending, and annealing conditions guided by different template features.

The sequential processing of 2D BCP patterns can build multiple stacks of nanostructures with the same or different morphologies, with various orientations or registrations between the layers. This strategy can create 3D microdomain arrays with non-periodic structuring along the vertical direction. By contrast, each layer of 3D structures fabricated by casting and assembling thick BCP films contains microdomains with the same morphology and usually a common orientation. Stacking methods can be categorized into two types: self-alignment of an upper layer of microdomains by a lower layer, and an orientation-independent stacking approach. Such templated self-assembly schemes provide a wide variety of device-oriented patterns.</p>

      <h2 id="sect837"><span class="a_heading">4. Nanohybrids and nanoporous materials from templated synthesis</span></h2>
      <span>One of the approaches to fabricate polymer-based nanohybrids is to combine the self-assembly of hydrophilic BCPs and the hybridization of inorganic fillers. For instance, Gutmann and co-workers demonstrated that hexagonally packed TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dots in a polymer matrix can be formed using PS-PEO as a template for a one-step hybridization process through spin coating a solution with a TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> precursor and PS-PEO, in which the precursor can be selectively incorporated into the self-assembled PEO microdomains.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> Also, the fabrication of periodic TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanorods templated by PS-P4VP was demonstrated by Shipp and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a> PS-P4VP thin films with P4VP cylinders perpendicular to the substrate were used as templates for the sol–gel reaction of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> precursors in the P4VP microdomains. In contrast to the fabrication of low-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanodots and nanorods, 3D complex nanostructures can also be prepared through this approach. Wiesner and co-workers reported the first use of BCPs for the synthesis of highly ordered metal oxide nanohybrids containing multiple layers, in which ABC triblock terpolymers, namely polyisoprene-<span class="italic">b</span>-polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(ethylene oxide) (PI–PS–PEO, ISO), were used as templates to coordinate the nanoparticles (NPs). The phase behaviors of several ISO-oxide nanohybrids were investigated, spanning a large range of compositions along the <span class="italic">f</span><small><sub>I</sub></small> = <span class="italic">f</span><small><sub>S</sub></small> isopleth, using aluminosilicate and niobia sols to obtain complex morphologies, including core–shell hexagonal cylinders, core–shell gyroids, three-domain lamellae, and core–shell inverse-hexagonal cylinders, giving a variety of nanostructures as templates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">167</span></sup></a> Moreover, Wiesner and co-workers demonstrated the co-assembly of niobia NPs with ISO triblock terpolymers to give multiple network morphologies with inorganic network structures, including alternating DG or single gyroid (SG) (spacing group: <span class="italic">I</span>4<small><sub>1</sub></small>32), <span class="italic">Fddd</span>, and <span class="italic">Fd</span><img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_0033_0304.gif" alt="[3 with combining macron]"/><span class="italic">m</span>.

After calcination to remove the polymer matrix, nanoporous ceramic networks could be fabricated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> Similar approaches can also be used for the fabrication of ordered nanoporous carbon. For instance, the metal- and halogen-free synthesis of gyroid-forming nanoporous carbon was fabricated by using phenol formaldehyde resols as carbon precursors for co-assembling with the ISO triblock terpolymers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> Although well-defined nanohybrids with various structures and sizes can be successfully synthesized from hydrophilic BCPs (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, soft templating), those approaches generally involve a multistep process and, most critically, it is not easy to produce nanohybrids with high load-bearing capacity for inorganic fillers. The reason for this is that after removal of the polymer matrix, it is difficult for the inorganic fillers to connect with each other to form self-supporting nanostructure. Also, the phase behaviors of the mixtures of the BCP template and the precursors or NPs vary with the composition, and thus the controlled order and orientation of forming nanostructured phases, in particular in a thin-film state, is a challenging task.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Therefore, pre-made nanoporous BCPs as templates for templated synthesis (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, hard templating) have been developed. The fully-developed nanochannels from prepared BCP templates can provide enough space for a high loading of inorganic fillers, thus giving free-standing and well-defined inorganic nanostructure after removal of the matrix, and also a controlled order and orientation can be achieved before the templated syntheses. Most importantly, there are many syntheses available using pre-made templates as nanoreactors for controlled reactions. In this section, we focus on the templated syntheses that use nanoporous polymeric materials from degradable BCPs, in particular with a gyroid-forming texture, for the fabrication of well-defined nanomaterials. The principles of the various templated syntheses, including the sol–gel reaction (Section 4.1), electrochemical deposition (Section 4.2), electroless plating (Section 4.3), and atomic layer deposition (Section 4.4), from the fundamentals to their practical uses in the synthesis of various nanohybrids and nanoporous materials, are presented.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">For a successful templated synthesis, several conditions including pore size, morphology, and density of pores, as well as the intrinsic properties of the templates, should be considered and must meet certain requirements. First, the templates have to be compatible with the processing conditions. For example, suitable solvents should be used to prevent the swelling and deformation of polymeric templates. Also, the pore walls of the templates should be wetted by the depositing materials or solution in the pore-filling process. The pore-filling process can be considered as a simple templated method for reshaping materials—a physical approach without a chemical reaction—or as the first step for the subsequent templated synthesis (templated chemical reactions). Although various precursors, such as medicines, metal salts, metal alkoxides, and organic monomers, can be filled into the nanochannels to form nanohybrids, the pre-existing air is usually hard to remove and can become the diffusion barrier. To solve this problem, capillary force, also called capillary attraction or capillarity, is used to release the pre-existing air, leading to a successful pore-filling process. Capillary forces result from the interaction of the liquid, gas, and solid surfaces, at the interface between them. In a liquid phase, molecules are held together through cohesive forces. In the bulk of a liquid, the cohesive forces between one molecule and the surrounding molecules are balanced. Nevertheless, for the same molecule at the edge of the liquid, the cohesive forces with other liquid molecules are larger than the interaction with air molecules. Therefore, the liquid molecules at the interface are pulled together towards the liquid. Capillary forces come from the three forces from the three contact phases: liquid, solid and vapor (air), trying simultaneously to minimize the contact area between the three phases. As mentioned above, capillary forces are critical at the nanoscale. The liquid–air interface at a narrow hydrophobic structure causes an air block, preventing the liquid from entering the nanochannels. As a result, thermal treatment or the addition of surfactants (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, alcohols for BCP templating) is a suitable approach to minimize the free surface between the liquid and air, leading to successful pore-filling for the subsequent templated synthesis (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a chemical templated approach). For example, Russell and co-workers developed an effective and convenient approach for fabricating templated carbon nanotubes. They combined polymer solution wetting and poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) carbonization techniques to generate carbon nanotubes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">170</span></sup></a> Recently, we also fabricated graphite-like nanotubes using a solvent-annealing process from poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) pore-filling AAO templates (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26a</a>). The molecular orientation of anisotropic PAN chains was induced by solvent annealing <span class="italic">via</span> capillary filling to achieve an appropriate molecular packing for carbonization. Consequently, hundred-nanometer-sized carbon nanotubes were formed after carbonation. Importantly, carbon nanotubes with a graphite-like structure and high crystallinity could be fabricated for the further fabrication of a core–shell cylinder texture <span class="italic">via</span> multiple pore-filling processes (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26b</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> Furthermore, in addition to inorganic templates (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, AAO template), we developed organic templates (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a nanoporous PS template) for templated syntheses.

        <h3 id="sect883"><span class="b_heading">4.1 Templated sol–gel reactions</span></h3>
        <span>The sol–gel reaction is a wet-chemical technique which is widely used in science and engineering. Precursors, such as metal alkoxides and metal salts, are used to form a chemical solution (sol) for the subsequent gelation process. After hydrolysis, followed by a condensation reaction, the transparent solution starts to become an integrated network (gel) of either network polymers or discrete colloidal particles. A considerable number of useful ceramic oxides, including the oxides of Al, Si, Ti, Zn, and Zr, can be synthesized through the sol–gel reaction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> By using nanoporous PS from PS-PLLA as a template for the sol–gel reaction, various nanostructured ceramics can be fabricated after removal of the PS.

Here, by taking advantage of the controlled self-assembly of BCP*, PS-PLLA, an H* phase could be formed. Subsequently, 3D helical nanochannels could be fabricated after hydrolysis of the PLLA block in the self-assembled H* phase. With execution of the sol–gel reaction within the helical nanochannels, the fabrication of 3D ordered helical nanohybrids, PS–SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, was achieved (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig27">Fig. 27a</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> After degeneration of the PS matrix by UV exposure, the structure of the SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanohelices can be clearly visualized.

        <p class="otherpara">For successful pore-filling in templated synthesis, the critical step is retarding the reaction rate of hydrolysis to alleviate the problem of forming large gelled aggregates, which would result in blocking of the nanochannels. However, transition metal alkoxides with the chemical formula M(OR)<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>, such as Ti(OR)<small><sub>4</sub></small> and Zr(OR)<small><sub>4</sub></small>, are usually unstable and highly reactive. Unlike the precursors of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the pore filling of those transition metal alkoxide precursors will be blocked for templated synthesis when exposed to moisture, heat, or light. Consequently, precisely fabricating well-defined polymer–ceramic nanohybrids from those transition metal alkoxide remains a challenge. To fabricate well-ordered polymer–ceramic gyroid nanohybrids from the templated synthesis of reactive transition metal alkoxides, controlled factors, such as pH value, temperature, and the solvent used for the templated sol–gel reaction, should be justified, as illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig28">Fig. 28</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> Metal alkoxides with the chemical formula of M(OR)<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> are the precursors. To avoid blocking in the pore-filling process and to achieve a successful templated synthesis, the rates of the pore-filling process and sol–gel reaction should be balanced, whereby the pore filling should be performed before the growth of oversized gels. As a result, an acid-catalyzed sol–gel reaction is usually carried out (pH value below 4) for yielding primarily linear polymers with minor randomly branched polymers, whereas oversized gels are formed at high pH value (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig28">Fig. 28a</a>). Under acid-catalyzed conditions, OR groups can be easily protonated first by H<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions, so that the metal M becomes electrophilic, and thus more susceptible to be attacked by H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O to form hydrolyzed species, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, M(OH)<small><sub><span class="italic">z</span></sub></small>(OR)<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span>−<span class="italic">z</span></sub></small>. Subsequently, condensation occurs from those hydrolyzed species. It is noted that, for the acid-catalyzed sol–gel reaction, OH groups are preferentially generated at the end of chain, leading to the formation of linear polymer chains. By contrast, non-spinnable sols or branched clusters might be grown in base-catalyzed sol–gel reactions, resulting in the formation of oversized gels that block the pore-filling process. Nevertheless, incomplete pore filling was found when the templated process was carried out at room temperature, even under acid-catalyzed conditions, indicating that the sol–gel reaction is still too fast to achieve a successful pore filling for templated reactions, due to the growth of oversized gels (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig28">Fig. 28b</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">To reduce the reaction rate in order to form linear polymer chains for pore filling, the sol–gel reaction is therefore carried out at low temperatures (under 10 °C). In general, metal alkoxides are often dissolved in solvents before hydrolysis, because the dilution process is able to lower the reaction rates of hydrolysis and condensation for a stabilized solution. Also, by using solvents with a lower polar character for the sol–gel reaction, a coordination expansion of the reactive transition metal may occur through alkoxy bridging, because of the higher coordination number of the transition metal, which can stabilize the sols <span class="italic">via</span> a reduction of the reaction rate. Usually, non-polar solvents, such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, are used. Nevertheless, these non-polar solvents can dissolve the PS templates. Therefore, considering the pore-filling process for a hydrophobic PS template and suitable solvents for the metal alkoxides, acyclic alcohols can be used as surfactants for the pore-filling process by capillary force (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, wetting) and as solvents for the templated sol–gel reaction. For the formation of stable sols, solvents with weaker polarity are required for the sol–gel reaction. Therefore, propanol is used for the templated sol–gel reaction. Here, even though the suggested templated reaction can be successfully achieved, a gyroid-like morphology with a distorted structure is found after the sol–gel reaction (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig28">Fig. 28c</a>), reflecting that although the dissolution problem for the PS template can be alleviated by using propanol as solvent, the template is still swollen by propanol, resulting in distortion of the templated morphology. To reduce the degree of swelling of the PS template, acyclic alcohols with a stronger polarity, such as methanol, are thus used for the templated reaction. Nevertheless, it is inevitable to encounter problems with the fast hydrolysis and condensation rates of transition metal alkoxides, due to the increase in polarity, and as precipitation may occur immediately. Moreover, it is difficult to slow down the sol–gel reaction, even with a high loading of methanol under a relatively moisture-free environment (for instance, in a glove box). To form linear polymer chains for the pore-filling process, an acid chelating agent (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, acetylacetone) should be used. Here, a tautomeric equilibrium between the keto and enol forms occur for acetylacetone in acyclic alcohol solvents, and the PS template can be swollen by the keto form, resulting in a distorted structure of the gyroid-like nanostructure (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig28">Fig. 28d</a>). To alleviate the swelling problem, a base chelating agent (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, diethanolamine (DEA)) is thus used. It is noted that DEA acts as a weak base, like other organic amines. As a result, the loading content of DEA should be balanced by the introduction of acid catalysts to maintain the required pH (pH &lt; 4) for the linear step polymerization of metal alkoxides under acidic conditions; a higher molar concentration of HCl<small><sub>(aq)</sub></small> should be used for the templated reaction. Consequently, well-defined bicontinuous ceramic gyroid-forming networks in a polymeric matrix (polymer–ceramic gyroid nanohybrids) can be successfully fabricated <span class="italic">via</span> an acid-catalyzed sol–gel reaction by using a suitable chelating agent in methanol under low-temperature conditions. Furthermore, a calcination process can be performed to remove the polymer template, so as to prepare nanoporous gyroid ceramics with a crystalline phase (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig28">Fig. 28e</a>). To alleviate the crystallization effect on the templated morphology and the distortion from the thermal expansion and cooling shrinkage, a specific thermal treatment needs to be performed. As a result, free-standing, nanoporous gyroid ceramics with a high crystallinity can be successfully fabricated (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29a</a>). It is noted that one of the well-known characteristics of nanostructured TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is its photocatalytic properties for organic components in viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae, and cancer cells, which can be totally degraded and mineralized to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, and harmless inorganic anions. The corresponding photocatalytic efficiency is strongly dependent upon the surface area and the porosity of the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. On this basis, we demonstrated the photocatalytic efficiency of nanoporous gyroid TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> by the decomposition of dye molecules. Nanoporous gyroid TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with a self-supporting nanostructure and controlled crystalline phase was synthesized from the templated sol–gel reaction. Commercial P25 TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photocatalysts were used for comparison, and methylene blue (MB) was used as a pollutant to examine the photocatalytic activity of the gyroid TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. As found from the degradation trend experiments, the decomposition rate of the MB became significant after introducing the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photocatalysts into the MB solution, giving a first-order kinetics decomposition reaction (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29b</a>). It was obvious that use of the nanoporous gyroid TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for the decomposition of the MB gave rise to a significant increase in the photocatalytic efficiency (about two times higher than for commercial P25 TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> powders). In contrast to the commercial P25 TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> powders, the high efficiency of the nanoporous gyroid TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was attributed to its bicontinuous nanostructure with an extremely high surface area and high porosity, facilitating the adsorption of solution contaminants and effective utilization of UV light.</p>

        <h3 id="sect975"><span class="b_heading">4.2 Templated electrochemical deposition</span></h3>
        <span>Electroplating deposition is a plating process that uses electrical current to reduce the cations of a desired material from a solution to coat a conductive object with a thin layer of the materials, such as metals, semi-conductive ceramics, and conjugated polymers. To electrochemically deposit materials inside the nanochannels of a polymer template, the working electrode is usually coated by the polymer template; the counter and the reference electrodes are placed in the plating bath, connected to an external source of current. Both components are immersed in a solution referred to as an electrolyte, containing one or more dissolved salts (usually metallic ions) and other ions that allow the flow of electricity. A rectifier supplies a direct current to the anode, oxidizing the materials to release ions into the electrolyte solution. At the cathode, the dissolved (pre-selected) ions in the electrolyte solution are reduced at the interface between the solution and the cathode. To fill the nanochannels completely, the surface of the polymer template covering on the working electrode should be accessible to the plating bath. However, diffusion of chemicals in the template may become difficult for thicker polymer templates with non-ordered structures, resulting in many defects or dead areas. Therefore, for polymer templates with anisotropic structures, such as 1D cylinders and 2D lamellae, proper alignment prior to templated electroplating deposition is required. Russell and co-workers successfully fabricated metallic nanowires using BCP templates with aligned cylinder nanochannels for electroplating deposition.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">For polymer templates with well-defined 3D isotropic nanochannels, such as gyroid- and diamond-forming nanochannels, it is much easier to obtain nanohybrid materials with homogeneous properties <span class="italic">via</span> templated electroplating deposition without any pre-alignment.

Indeed, the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell is one of the most promising nanotechnology-based nanohybrid photovoltaic systems, and has drawn widespread attention for fabricating nanoscale semiconductor materials with an extremely large internal surface area. For a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell, light is harvested in a monolayer of the dye, so a large surface area to volume ratio of the metal oxide is required to give the system sufficient dye density for complete light absorption. A gyroid-forming phase, consisting of two interwoven continuous networks of the minority block dispersed in a matrix phase of the majority block, may provide a monodisperse pore diameter in which all the nanochannels and struts are fully interconnected, while the continuous networks may be degenerated. These attributes are conceptually ideal for the fabrication of nanohybrid solar cells, where the open, uniformly sized pores can enable effective infiltration of an organic phase. Also, the pre-defined and monodisperse length scale enables optimized charge generation and collection through the 3D pathways.</p>

The gradual growth of vanadia, progressing from the FTO surface through the porous gyroid network, is stopped after 120 s before reaching the free surface of the template to yield 1.1 ± 0.1 μm thick films. After removal of the PFS template, a highly periodic V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> replica can be fabricated. Because of the specific characters of the gyroid-forming structure, the devices surpass previous inorganic electrochromic materials in all relevant parameters: the switching speed, coloration contrast, and the composite coloration efficiency.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30,31</span></sup></a> V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> forming a bicontinuous gyroid structure on the 10 nm scale can be used to fabricate supercapacitors, yielding devices with a promising combination of high power and energy densities (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig32">Fig. 32a</a>). To demonstrate their performance in energy storage, gyroid-forming V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> networks were used to fabricate supercapacitors. A highly conducting room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), triethylsulfonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, was chosen as the electrolyte. RTILs are molten salts with a melting point close to or below room temperature. They are composed of bulky organic cations and smaller anions that only loosely associate. Nonflammable RTIL gels have already been used as electrolytes in supercapacitors, enabling flexibility, safe operation, and a large electrochemical window (the electrochemical potential range over which the electrolyte is neither reduced nor oxidized at the electrodes). Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) was used as the lithium salt since it has the same anion as the RTIL. The supercapacitor was assembled with a pair of electrodes made of FTO-coated glass sheets, each coated with approximately 1 μm thick gyroid-forming V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small>. Electrochemical testing was performed using supercapacitor devices prepared by sandwiching a precut thermoplastic gasket as a spacer between laterally offset electrodes, thus obviating the need for a separator and enabling an observation of the color change of both electrodes (inset of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig32">Fig. 32a and b</a>). The electrochemical properties of such supercapacitors with templated and non-templated electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry at a sweep rate of 50 mV s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for voltage sweeps between −1 V and 1 V and from −0.5 V to 0.5 V. In the potential range from −0.5 V to 0.5 V, both V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> materials exhibit nearly rectangular CV traces, indicating good capacitive characteristics for the devices. In the −1 V to 1 V potential range, supercapacitors with the lithium salt containing electrolyte show pseudocapacitive redox peaks. The capacitive current density of the gyroid-forming V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig32">Fig. 32c</a>) is much higher compared to the significantly thicker and denser non-templated V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> film. This is important as supercapacitor charge storage offers a number of desirable properties when compared with conventional batteries, including charging within seconds, long-term cycling stability, and the ability to deliver up to ten times more power. These features are used not only in high power demanding applications, such as power buffers and power saving units, but also in energy recovery. Whereas, charge storage through non-faradaic means is fairly straightforward, a variety of distinct chemical options are available for charge storage through faradaic or redox-type reactions. The results presented here illustrate the benefits of applying a gyroid-forming V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> in a combined electrochromic and electrochemical energy storage device.</p>

        <span>Electroless plating is a chemical deposition process which depends on the catalytic reduction process of metal ions in an aqueous solution containing a chemical reducing agent. Unlike electrochemical deposition, the process of electroless plating is not necessary to pass an electric current through the solution to form a deposit. With the correct pre-plate catalyst (generally, palladium (Pd)), metal ions can be reduced by the reducing agent, such that solid metal clusters are deposited on non-conductive surfaces without any flux-density and power supply issues. In traditional electroless plating, sensitizing and activating are also carried out. A sensitizing treatment is used to produce gels to enhance adhesion between the metal coatings and substrates. An activating process is carried out for the formation of catalytic sites to initiate the subsequent electroless plating. Brinke, Loos, and co-workers demonstrated the fabrication of Ni nanofoams by using supramolecular PS-P4VP(pentadecylphenol, PDP) complexes with gyroid-forming nanochannels as templates. The complete dissolution of PDP from the complex with the major P4VP(PDP) component forming the matrix resulted in an open network structure with struts consisting of a PS core and a P4VP corona for the subsequent electroless deposition of Ni.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> Moreover, supramolecular complexes of poly(<span class="italic">tert</span>-butoxystyrene)<span class="italic">-b</span>-polystyrene<span class="italic">-b</span>-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PtBOS–PS–P4VP) triblock terpolymers and PDP were used to self-assemble into core–shell gyroid structures, with the core channels formed by the hydrogen-bonded P4VP(PDP) complexes.

Metallic materials possessing autocatalytic properties, including Fe, Co, Ni, Pt, Pd, Au, and Ag, are good candidates for this templated electroless plating. However, as Ni materials, in particular with nanostructured structures, are very important catalytic materials and are widely used in science and industry, templated electroless Ni plating was carried out first in our laboratory to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for the fabrication of well-defined metallic networks.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The nanoporous PS templates were soaked in an aqueous Pd<small><sup>+2</sup></small> solution mixed with acyclic alcohols (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, methanol or ethanol), as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig34">Fig. 34a</a>. The acyclic alcohol was used to promote the wetting tendency of the activating solution into the PS templates through capillary force. After washing gently with a solution of acyclic alcohol–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O to remove any redundant Pd<small><sup>+2</sup></small> covering the sample surfaces, the pore-filled templates with the Pd<small><sup>+2</sup></small> solution were then immersed into a freshly prepared Ni bath at room temperature. Consequently, nucleation of the Pd clusters was initialized, at which point the Pd<small><sup>+2</sup></small> ions are reduced to Pd clusters by reducing agents (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, hydrazinium hydroxide). Note that the concentration of the activating solution prepared here is quite dilute and any redundant Pd<small><sup>+2</sup></small> covering the sample surface is just washed out. As a result, only a small amount of Pd clusters could be generated within the PS templates (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig34">Fig. 34b</a>). Accordingly, Ni<small><sup>+2</sup></small> is reduced to Ni at the catalytic sites of the Pd clusters. By taking advantage of the self-catalytic behavior of electroless plating for the automatically continuous process of Ni formation, the reduced Ni serves as the new nucleus for the subsequent Ni reductions so that the Ni deposition process continues until the nanochannels are fully filled (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig34">Fig. 34c</a>). Thereby, a well-ordered metallic gyroid-forming nanostructure with high crystallinity in a PS matrix is synthesized. After removal of the matrix, free-standing, gyroid-forming nanoporous metals can be successfully fabricated to give precisely controlled architectures with high porosity and surface area (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig34">Fig. 34d</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, a variety of well-defined metallic nanostructures, such as metallic NPs, metallic branches, ordered nanoporous metallic particles, and gyroid-forming metallic networks, can be synthesized by controlling the nucleation and growth process (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, <span class="italic">via</span> the seeding growth approach) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig35">Fig. 35</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> The seeding growth approach usually involves two steps: synthesis of the seeds (nuclei) and growth of the seeds. In contrast to the classical seeding growth process, the templated seeding growth for the synthesis of nanostructured Au provides the advantages of simple operation and an easy control of the size and shape of Au without the need for any surfactants or additional ions, such as Ag ions (Ag<small><sup>+</sup></small>). The initial Au seeds can be formed after reduction of the Au ions (Au<small><sup>+3</sup></small>) by strong reducing agents (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, hydrazinium hydroxide). The seeding density of Au can be easily adjusted by controlling the concentration of Au ions, in which the seeding density of Au increases with the initial concentration of Au ions. To achieve a successful templating, it is necessary to introduce the metal ions in advance to of the metal deposition. Therefore, weak reducing agents (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, DEA) are used for the growth process. Following the growth of Au nanostructures, a continuous reduction of Au ions can be homogeneously conducted with a reduction in time. Consequently, Au branches, ordered nanoporous Au particles, and gyroid-forming Au networks, can be gradually developed in a polymer matrix. Note that Au networks synthesized by the templated seeding growth approach retain defects, because it is difficult to completely fill the pores due to diffusion limitations. For a 3D architecture with gyroid-forming networks, electrochemical deposition is a feasible method to obtain well-ordered Au with long-range order by the deposition of Au in a gyroid-forming polymer template. By contrast, the advantage of the templated seeding growth approach is its ability to fabricate well-ordered branched Au and ordered nanoporous metallic particles, which can be hardly synthesized by other approaches.</p>

Because of the highly-branched morphologies of the gyroid-forming structure, the ensemble absorption of the gyroid-forming Au multibranches appear as a shoulder peak ranging from 600 nm to 800 nm. Also, the profile of the simulation results is similar to that of the experimental results. Note that nanostructured Au with a highly branched morphology that absorbs and scatters in the near-infrared region (NIR, 760–1400 nm), the so-called optical window, can exhibit a strong enhancement of an electromagnetic field, leading to SERS for biomedical applications. Moreover, the PS–Au nanohybrids (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, well-defined Au multibranches in a PS matrix) can be easily fabricated for device design, due to easy processing of the polymeric materials. Based on device design, we suggest an effective method to create a 3D SERS-active substrate using a gyroid-forming nanoporous polymer as a template for templated electroless plating, leading to the formation of Au multibranches with sharp tips and corners for reliable SERS devices.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46</span></sup></a> To evaluate the performance of Au multibranches for SERS, a crystal violet (CV) solution was used as a probe molecule.

In comparison with the 2D SERS-active substrate, the SERS efficiency of the 3D SERS-active substrate composed of Au multibranches is significantly enhanced by the larger number of hotspots, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig36">Fig. 36d</a>. The average enhancement factor of the 3D SERS-active substrate with Au multibranches is estimated to be approximately 4.6 × 10<small><sup>8</sup></small> at 532 nm. Therefore, a superior SERS detection sensitivity with high reproducibility and stability using a SERS-active substrate with gyroid-forming Au multibranches was successfully fabricated. These polymer–metal nanohybrids allow the fabrication of polymer-based SERS-active devices with mechanical robustness and chemical stability to provide protection from the surrounding environments.</p>

        <span>As mentioned above, well-defined nanoporous ceramics and metals can be synthesized <span class="italic">via</span> a templated sol–gel reaction, electrochemical deposition, and electroless plating. However, it is difficult to control the reaction process to form complex morphologies, such as nanotubes, with tunable thickness. For this purpose, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process was developed to fabricate nanomaterials with adjustable thickness. Wang and co-workers prepared highly porous (porosity up to 90%) 3D networks of interconnected metal oxide nanotubes by the ALD of metal oxides (Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) onto swelling-induced nanoporous BCP templates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> They demonstrated that the minority domains in amphiphilic BCPs (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, PS-P2VP) can be swollen by selective solvents, yielding a continuous nanoporous template after solvent evaporation. The nanoporous BCP template is then subjected to the ALD of metal oxides, yielding a conformal thin layer of oxides that tightly adheres to the BCP framework. The BCP component is then burned off and converted to void spaces with a likewise continuous morphology, whereas the coating oxide layer survives and maintains the integrity of the film (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig37">Fig. 37a</a>). Although the Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> nanotube networks were not well-ordered structures, their continuous pore systems with high porosity (∼70–90%) and ultrathin tube walls (around 3 nm) led to significantly improved humidity-sensing performance. The Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> network shows a significantly higher current than others in the relative humidity range of 30–90%, because the larger porosity facilitates faster diffusion and consequently enhances the adsorption of more moisture onto the Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> tube surface. Compared to other nanostructure-based sensors, the Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> nanotube networks show a faster response time and recovery time, which is attributed to the highly porous and interconnected nanotube network structures.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">Although the amphiphilic BCPs after solvent evaporation provide an easy way to obtain nanoporous polymer templates, their nanochannels in the polymer matrix are not well defined, resulting in disordered inorganic replicas. Steiner and co-workers reported a method for the robust and reliable synthesis of fully crystalline 3D well-defined ZnO networks using the ALD of ZnO into a nanoporous template from PS–PI.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> Several-micrometer-thick layers of nanoporous ZnO networks with a strut width of 30 nm could be synthesized by carefully optimizing the ALD processing conditions. ALD deposition into polymer templates requires careful selection of the deposition temperature. The ALD deposition window for ZnO is 80–150 °C, delimited by the minimum precursor reaction temperature and the precursor desorption from the template walls. Two types of exposure methods were explored: continuous flow and stop-flow methods, leading to a successful replication of the ZnO networks, as shown in (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig37">Fig. 37b</a>). ZnO is a direct semiconductor with a wide bandgap of 3.37 eV. In its thin-film form, it is used as a transparent semi-conductive electrode for optoelectronic and solar cell applications. To demonstrate the potential application of the ALD-generated nanoporous ZnO layer for hybrid photovoltaics, a worm-like ZnO layer was deposited onto a conductive pre-patterned ITO substrate and then infiltrated with P3HT polymer. Although gyroid-forming ZnO networks can be fabricated by templated ALD, 3D worm-like ZnO networks were chosen here because of the better control over film thickness and uniformity, for demonstration of the optoelectronic efficiency. The increased effective surface area in the nanoporous layer increases exciton dissociation at the ZnO/P3HT interface and hence increases the photocurrent. Also, Steiner reported an interesting process for fabricating nanostructured calcite (CaCO<small><sub>3</sub></small>) single crystals with the gyroid morphology.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a> In the reported process, single-crystal formation occurred <span class="italic">via</span> an amorphous precursor phase that infiltrated the nanoporous polymer network, faithfully replicating its 30 nm features.

Methanol (20 vol%) was added to the solution to facilitate its infiltration into the gyroid structure, which otherwise exhibited a hydrophobic behavior. The use of BCP templates therefore represents a significant step forward in developing a general strategy for synthesizing crystals with complex forms, where the overall size of the crystal, and the geometry and periodicity of their internal structures, are all controllable features (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig38">Fig. 38b</a>).</p>

      <h2 id="sect1189"><span class="a_heading">5. Applications of well-ordered nanostructured materials</span></h2>
      <span>From the materials chemistry perspective, a common approach to address the current limitations in applications is to generate advanced materials with specific properties, or with combinations of specific properties, with architectures in the nanometer length scale. Precise compositional and morphological control down to the nanometer length scale in 3D space may lead to breakthroughs on many material applications. Network morphologies, such as gyroid-forming materials with 3D well-ordered structures in the nanoscale, are especially appealing for these purposes; as demonstrated in the previous section, where gyroid-forming materials from BCP templating could give stable, homogeneous, and isotropic materials, and thus could give rise to promising properties for use in many applications. For instance, as briefly mentioned in Section 4, gyroid-forming nanohybrids and nanoporous materials can be applied in optoelectronics (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, solar cells), energy storage, catalysis, and sensing, because of their homogeneous structures with high porosity and large specific surface area. For instance, in comparison with non-ordered network nanostructures of anatase TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for solar cell applications, ordered TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanostructures, such as gyroid-forming nanostructures, possess superior performance, due to their better accessibility from their ordered pores with a high surface area and superior diffusion ability for the absorption of dyes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> Moreover, nanoporous gyroid materials can be further surface-functionalized to extend their applications in many fields. For instance, biocompatible gyroid-forming nanoporous materials are suitable for use as a container in applications such as drug delivery, due to the precise control of pore size.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> As demonstrated in our laboratory, a poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA)-functionalized nanoporous gyroid SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with double stimuli-responsive PDMAEMA brushes grafted on the surface of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> could be fabricated. By taking advantage of the responses of the PDMAEMA to pH and temperature, their pore features could be well controlled by stretching and re-coiling. Because of the high porosity, open-cell character of the 3D network morphology with the uniform pore size and biocompatibility of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the functionalized nanoporous gyroid SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can improve the therapeutic efficiency and specificity by being used as a the free-standing environment-selective delivery system. By controlling the pH or temperature, different releasing behavior can be observed in the cumulative release profiles of riboflavin-loaded PDMAEMA-functionalized nanoporous gyroid SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in response to different environments. The as-designed system can provide new insights into stimuli-responsive polymers with respect to the corresponding controlled release behavior, with the drug release studies being closely consistent with the nanoporous materials containing grafted stimulus responsive polymers. Namely, gyroid-forming nanoporous materials have great potential to be functional materials, based on their homogeneously structural characters (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, uniform nanopores with high porosity and large specific surface area). Most importantly, a gyroid is a well-ordered structure with specific structural characters (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, well-ordered 3D networks) that give it novel optical and photonic characteristics, as well as useful mechanical properties with the free-standing structure. In the following section, we particularly focus on the properties and applications of 3D regular (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, gyroid-forming) nanostructured materials taking advantage of the “well-ordered” structural characteristics of the forming texture.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect1206"><span class="b_heading">5.1 Photonic behaviors and optical properties of gyroid-forming nanostructures</span></h3>
        <span>Coloring in nature mostly comes from the inherent colors of materials, but sometimes it has a purely physical origin, such as diffraction or the interference of light, and this is called structural color. Over millions of years biological systems have developed delicately arranged architectures to produce striking optical effects. One of the most famous examples is the dazzling green color in the wings of some specific butterfly species, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39a</a>, from two families in particular: Papilionidae and Lycaenidae, which result from complicated nanostructures at sub-micrometer scale, where which regular arrays of ornate chitin “single gyroid (SG, <span class="italic">I</span>4<small><sub>1</sub></small>32)” sprout at their wings' surfaces.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> The butterflies have developed the thermodynamically favored double gyroid (DG, <span class="italic">Ia</span><img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_0033_0304.gif" alt="[3 with combining macron]"/><span class="italic">d</span>) precursors as a route to form SG nanostructures, providing significant optical efficiency. Prum and co-workers showed that the cell plasma membrane and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) membrane in the butterfly wings interact to form a pair of parallel lipid-bilayer membranes, separated by the cellular cytoplasm. The two parallel lipid-bilayer membranes of the developing scale cell form a core–shell alternating DG morphology, which can be observed in the ABC triblock copolymer melts.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179,180</span></sup></a> By exploiting the inherent biological differentiation between the intracellular and extracellular volumes of a cell, the lipid-bilayer membranes of developing butterfly photonic scale cells define the unique pentacontinuous volumes of a core–shell DG (this should be a core–shell alternating DG) structure of the form ABCB′A′, in which A is the extracellular space, B is the plasma membrane, C is the cell's cytoplasmic volume, B′ is the SER membrane, and A′ is the intra-SER space (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39b</a> and insets). Following the development of the ABCB′A′ core–shell alternating gyroid structure (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39c-I</a>), chitin is deposited and polymerized in the extracellular space (A) that is now within the peripheral outline of the scale cell. This extracellular space forms the core of one of the gyroid networks (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39c</a>, red), which is enclosed by the plasma membrane (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39c-II</a>, black). As the cell dies, the cellular cytoplasm and the membranes (BCB′A′ blocks of the core–shell alternating gyroid) are replaced with air, leaving behind a SG network of chitin (A) in air (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39c-III</a>). The developmental model proposes that the butterfly scale cells exploit the energetics of cubic membrane folding commonly seen in lipid-bilayer membranes of cellular organelles to develop the SG photonic nanostructures that are used in social and sexual communication. This 3D periodicity potentially manipulates light in all directions, so that a bright color is reflected over a broad angle. It is intuitive to ask the question as to why nature needs to develop such a complicated process in morphological evolution to simply structure color. The answer is straightforward and simple; only SG is able to provide a complete photonic bandgap for the reflection of light (see below for details), but the formation of SG from block copolymers is usually DG and not SG, because DG is the most stable phase thermodynamically, in which one is right-handed and the other is left-handed, hence these co-continuous networks do not give a cubic phase but rather a chiral one.</span>

This shows that the increase in the symmetry of the multi-network system destroys the photonic properties of the system. Design guidelines for obtaining robust photonic bandgaps in the well-ordered 3D network morphologies have been given in the form of gap maps for a range of volume fractions and dielectric contrasts. The double network structures can be tailored such that the two networks become chemically distinct, thus decreasing the symmetry and yielding a possible pathway for forming the single, 3D morphologies at optical length scales, such as the smart butterfly developing its unique morphological evolution wing structure.

The TEM image of a typical 〈211〉 projection of the DG-forming nanohybrids with a “double wave” pattern can be identified and is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig41">Fig. 41a</a>.

It is noted that the network morphology after softening or removing the PS matrix will exhibit a variety of geometric dispositions due to the set of small arbitrary shifts with various directions and magnitudes between the two networks in a given DG grain. The overall network shifting will be nearly random due to the various constraints on coherent shifting. Consequently, the applied network shifting will break the inversion symmetry of the DG phase, resulting in two incoherent SG networks. The network pairs will have various registrations, varying from grain to grain, leading to a nanomaterial with SG-like scattering properties. Also, TEM observations were carried out to examine the morphologies of the nanohybrids after the thermal treatment, and show that the “double wave” pattern (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig41">Fig. 41a</a>) of the DG structure transforms to a variety of unusual patterns, such as a honeycomb-like pattern (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig41">Fig. 41b</a>). The patterns such as the honeycomb-like pattern are attributed to the shifting of the two inorganic networks in the polymer matrix, as indicated by the repositioning of the tripods marked with the red and green colors. An approximate 〈111〉 projection can also be found where the two networks are shifted with respect to the original DG structure (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig41">Fig. 41c</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">In contrast to photonic crystals from regular structures with long-range order, recently there has been considerable interest in amorphous photonic crystals that possess only short-range order.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185</span></sup></a> Different from ordered photonic crystals, amorphous photonic crystals show unique optical properties, including isotropic photonic bandgaps or photonic pseudo-gaps, noniridescent structural-color productions, localized states by defects, and localization due to disorder.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit150"><sup><span class="sup_ref">150</span></sup></a> These interesting properties demonstrate that amorphous photonic crystals are a new kind of optical material and could have a variety of important applications, such as in photonics, color-related technologies, displays, and in solar cells. Nevertheless, there still remain many problems that need in-depth studies to be carried out, both theoretically and experimentally, as it is difficult to fabricate real amorphous structure for systematic study. Before that, photonic crystals from well-ordered structures had been well developed and today still play an important role in optical applications. In addition to photonic materials for their effective bandgap, well-ordered nanoporous materials possess a great benefit to give specific optical properties such as antireflective properties. Nanoporous materials with a nanostructured surface topology can be applied as optical and optoelectronic materials because of their transparent character of a feature scale smaller than the wavelength of the incoming light, and also their low refractive index attributed to the high porosity. The refractive indices of porous materials are related to the degree of porosity and to the refractive indices of the corresponding dense materials. Because of their low refractive index properties, nanoporous materials have been extensively exploited in optical applications, in particular for their antireflection properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit186"><sup><span class="sup_ref">186</span></sup></a> Antireflection structures are used to restrict the reflection of light from the surface of optical components and to improve transmission. For instance, Steiner and co-workers demonstrated porous polymer films for antireflection structures. They excellently controlled their film thicknesses to under a few hundred nanometers, as well as their pore sizes, by blending PS and PMMA for spinodal decomposition through phase separation, followed by the selective removal of the PS blocks. Nevertheless, their antireflection structures made from polymeric materials (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, PMMA) are not wear-resistant and may have strong absorption of incident light. As a result, nanoporous inorganic materials should be the ideal candidates for antireflection materials. In particular, nanoporous materials with well-ordered nanotextures possess homogeneously distributed nanopores, giving reliable and independent antireflective properties of the wavelength. On the basis of these concepts, we demonstrated the fabrication of a nanoporous gyroid-forming SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with high porosity and a well-defined 3D nanostructure <span class="italic">via</span> a templated sol–gel reaction from PS-PLLA for use in antireflective applications, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig43">Fig. 43</a> (see details in Section 4.1 with respect to the fabrication procedures of the nanoporous gyroid-forming SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a></p>

        <span>As mentioned above, photonic crystals can offer the possibility for controlling the flow of light, because their artificial periodic structures interact with an electromagnetic wave, strongly depending on the ratio between the lattice constant <span class="italic">a</span> and the electromagnetic wavelength <span class="italic">λ</span>. When <span class="italic">λ</span> ∼ <span class="italic">a</span>, light traveling through the photonic crystals strongly experiences the dielectric contrast between the different materials forming the periodic structure, in the same way as electrons “feel” the periodic potential in a semiconductor crystal. For a sufficiently strong dielectric contrast and with suitable geometric parameters, it is possible to obtain artificial materials possessing a frequency region in which light cannot propagate through the structure, called the photonic bandgap. On the other hand, when <span class="italic">λ</span> ≫ <span class="italic">a</span>, long-wavelength light traveling through the structure does not experience the details of the structure of the artificial material and the photonic crystal behaves as if it were homogeneous. Therefore, a new concept of optical materials is mentioned, leading to the development of metamaterials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit187"><sup><span class="sup_ref">187,188</span></sup></a> Metamaterials are artificial materials engineered to have properties that have not yet been found in nature. They are assemblies of multiple individual elements fashioned from conventional materials, such as metals or plastics. Also metamaterials are usually constructed into repeating patterns, often with macroscopic structures. In 1999, Pendry and co-workers first investigated the spectral response of metamaterials with respect to the classic sparse cubic wire array, which exhibits a great plasma frequency leading to interesting properties, for example, negative refraction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit187"><sup><span class="sup_ref">187</span></sup></a> Following this work, much effort has been devoted to the design and fabrication of metamaterials with a negative refractive index for use in potential applications. For example, negative index metamaterials can be used as superlenses to overcome the diffraction limit in imaging or to enable novel optical effects, including cloaking.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">189</span></sup></a> As described above, structured color attributed to the gyroid texture has been found in several species of butterfly wing structure. Note that the photonic properties of the butterfly wing structure are attributed to the SG texture from the unique morphological evolution of DG. The DG structure is composed of a cubic matrix and a pair of continuous, interpenetrating but independent, coherent SG networks, one left- and one right-handed, to form an achiral structure in 3D space. By contrast, the SG structure is a chiral structure. Within each of the two network domains bounded by the gyroid, there are two chiral elements of opposite rotation sense: three-fold screw axes along the [111] and, in the opposite rotation sense, four-fold screw axes along the [100] axes, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig45">Fig. 45</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit190"><sup><span class="sup_ref">190</span></sup></a> It is believed that chirality will lead to circular dichroism effects that may relate to insect communication. Many arthropods can detect linearly polarized light but human cannot. In other words, this suggests that self-assembled biological structures are worth exploring for hints to the optimal design of synthetic chiral optical metamaterials and circular polarization-sensitive optical devices. Using a circular polarization analysis of the band structure of SG networks from butterfly wings, Schröder-Turk and co-workers demonstrated strong circular dichroism effects, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, SG microstructure showed significant circular dichroism for blue to ultraviolet light, that warranted a search for biological receptors sensitive to circular polarization.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a></span>

        <p class="otherpara">The linearly polarized beamsplitter is another interesting optical device and is a widely used for optical component in photonics. It is typically built from a linearly birefringent crystal (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, calcite) with different critical reflection angles for right-handed and left-handed polarized light, leading to the transmission of one linear polarization and angled reflection of the other. Spiral photonic crystals, consisting of a square array of dielectric helices, can serve as a linearly polarized beamsplitter, however, they are highly anisotropic due to their uniaxial chirality. By contrast, a SG exhibits identical chiroptic properties along all three Cartesian axes, giving a linearly polarized beamsplitter regardless of the incident direction of light. Gu and co-workers presented a chiral beamsplitter for a linearly polarized beamsplitter from a nano-engineered photonic crystal.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> This device is schematically illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig46">Fig. 46a</a>. A triangular prism with an internal nanostructure corresponding to a chiral SG with a cubic unit cell size <span class="italic">a</span> = 1.2 μm was fabricated by a galvo-dithered direct laser writing method. The chiral beamsplitter (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig46">Fig. 46b</a>), consisting of a polymeric SG network (refractive index = 1.48) with a filling fraction of ∼30%, was oriented such that the top, bottom, and two sides of the prism clip the photonic crystal with a [100] inclination, and the input surface at the hypotenuse has a [110] inclination. While light is incident at 45° towards the prism's hypotenuse (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig46">Fig. 46a</a>), the reflected (transmitted) intensity strongly depends on the circular polarization state of the incident plane wave because of the chirality of the SG texture. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig46">Fig. 46c</a>, the incident light completely reflects off the chiral beamsplitter at a wavelength of 1570 nm due to the existence of a photonic bandgap. Light is in a transmission band and passes through the chiral beamsplitter with minimal reflection at the longer wavelength of 1650 nm. In particular, at a wavelength of 1615 nm, left-handed circularly polarized light is transmitted more through the chiral beamsplitter, whereas right-handed circularly polarized light is reflected more. The chiral beamsplitter phenomenon becomes significant at a wavelength of 1615 nm. As a result, the fabricated chiral SG network can be used to separate left- and right-handed circularly polarized light in the wavelength region around 1615 nm, providing a new form of polarization control.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">As mentioned above, most metamaterial fabrication today relies on top-down approaches, giving feasible approaches to produce 3D isotropic metamaterials for their practical applications. In contrast to the top-down approach, BCP self-assembly has emerged as a useful design tool to create well-ordered 3D nanostructures, including DG and DD for frontier nanoscale metamaterial properties. Wiesner and co-workers calculated the photonic bands of 3D periodic metallic nanomaterials (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, Au, Ag, and Al) with DG and with alternating DG morphologies. For the DG structure, negative refraction was predicted in the visible and near-infrared regime for low-loss metals like Ag and Al but not for Au. Owing to the chirality of the gyroid minority networks, circularly polarized light propagation was also predicted. They showed that the refractive index and negative refraction frequencies of the resultant metamaterials are controlled by the structural parameters of these morphologies. For the alternating DG structure, a surprising metallic bandgap was observed at low frequencies.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> It is noted that gyroid-forming metallic networks can be fabricated through templated electrochemical deposition and templated electroless plating using BCP as a template, as introduced in Section 4. Therefore, Steiner, Baumberg and co-workers first created SG-forming chiral optical metamaterial through the combination of BCP self-assembly and metal hybridization.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> A SG-forming Au network was prepared using ISO BCP films, which are known to self-assemble into the gyroid morphology with a chiral isoprene phase (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, alternating DG). As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig47">Fig. 47a</a>, the morphology of the orientated SG Au networks is perpendicular to the substrate surface across the entire sample, twinning in lateral directions with domain sizes of 10–100 μm. This material is continuous and has features in the 10 nm length scale and exhibits orientation-dependent color under linearly polarized incident light. Note that the DG structure is isotropic but the SG structure is anisotropic. As a result, the optical response of the SG structure strongly depends on its orientation. To probe the photonic behavior of the SG-forming Au metamaterial, transmission measurements on an aligned twinned domain were taken with left- and right-handed circularly polarized light. The sample was tilted by 35° and rotated around the [110] surface normal. For each full turn, there are two rotation angles for which the optical axis coincides with the chiral [111] direction of the SG. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig47">Fig. 47b</a> shows the normalized difference in gyrotropic transmission (Δ<span class="italic">T</span>) between right- and left-handed polarized light as a function of sample rotation angle, averaged over the frequency region between 600 nm and 750 nm. There are two maximal rotation angles (0° and 180°) of the transmission of circularly polarized light, at which the optical axis is colinear with the [111] and [110] directions. By changing the rotation angle, the optical path is increasingly obstructed by the Au struts, causing the reduction of |Δ<span class="italic">T</span>|. Therefore, the chirality in this SG metamaterial can be clearly observed by the rotation of the sample. The gyrotropic transmission can be well reproduced by a finite difference time domain calculation. Also, a short-wavelength resonance is seen for polarization along the 〈100〉<small><sub>G</sub></small> direction of the domain in the SG sample, which is red-shifted by 20% in the perpendicular direction. These findings pave the way for the potential mass production of optical metamaterials. Also, Steiner and co-workers demonstrated several approaches to tune the optical behavior of SG-forming optical metamaterials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> The optimized structural parameters led to a transmission through 300 nm thick layers of a SG-forming Au nanostructure up to 20%. These methods can also be applied to other 3D metamaterials. Increasing the lattice dimensions in the gyroid metamaterial reduces the plasma frequency and the transmissivity, which is highest for the small unit cell with the lowest filling fraction. By controlling the templated electrochemical deposition, nanoporous SG-forming templates with various filling fractions of Au can be achieved. With the increase of the filling fraction of Au from 30% to 90%, a reduction in the plasma wavelength results, leading to a blue shift of the reflectivity edge to shorter wavelengths. Once the filling fraction approaches 100% (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, solid SG-forming Au network), the reflection spectra are similar with that of solid Au and the reflection minimum disappears. Increasing the filling fraction of Au causes a continuous deformation in the shape of the reflectivity curves and increases the plasma frequency towards solid Au. Finally, the optical characteristics can be reversibly tuned by adjusting the refractive index of the medium that is infiltrated into the gyroid pore structure, revealing a linear variation of the plasma edge with the refractive index.</p>

        <h3 id="sect1384"><span class="b_heading">5.3 Periodic bicontinuous hybrids for energy absorption</span></h3>
        <span>As an extension of optical metamaterials, metamaterials can be broadly defined as including all well-ordered micro-/nano-structured materials, regardless of the relative scale ratio between the characteristic structural length and the wavelengths of electromagnetic or mechanical waves.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">191</span></sup></a> The structure of metamaterials can be considered as a homogeneous effective medium, because the characteristic length scale of their structures are one or more orders smaller than the wavelengths. The effective properties of a material arise not from the bulk behavior of the materials which compose it, but more from their deliberate structuring. As a result, metamaterials are at the intersection of two classical categories: materials and devices. The metamaterial concept has recently been extended to a variety of material properties, especially the mechanical behaviors. Compared to irregular structured materials, the mechanical properties of 3D well-ordered structured materials (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, mechanical metamaterials) are easier to predict using numerical simulations because of their regular geometries. In particular, it is well known that regular structural materials possess a negative Poisson's ratio due to their structural anisotropy, leading to better mechanical properties. Many natural structural materials are highly mechanically anisotropic, for instance, the shell of an abalone, the exoskeleton of a lobster, and human bones. Therefore, the evolution of mechanical metamaterials made from 3D periodic structured materials aims to develop entirely new and greatly enhanced material behaviors by rational design. From the above introduction of the unique texture of gyroid-forming networks, we can clearly ascertain their interesting properties and applications in optical fields based on their well-ordered chiral structures. In addatin for optical applications, by extension of the well-ordered structural character, the 3D periodic nanostructures possess great capacity for energy absorption for uses in the engineering of mechanically superior materials. It is well known that by fabricating randomly porous metals, materials with stronger mechanical properties are possible because of the nanoscale dimensions of the ligaments. Recently, a relatively new class of cellular materials, holographically defined networks, has been fabricated by the light-induced cross-linking of photoresists using the interference of multiple laser beams (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, interference lithography).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192</span></sup></a> Unlike traditional cellular materials, the cell geometry and topology of the holographic 3D periodic networks can be rationally designed. The geometry, scale, and volume fraction of the microstructure can be precisely controlled by interference lithography, while post exposure baking and flood illumination gives control of the cross-linking density of the materials. The cross-linking density, combined with the length scale and geometry of the material structures, tailor and determine the global mechanical behaviors of the system. Therefore, nanoscale networks made by interference lithography may lead to improved mechanical properties beyond specific stiffness, including enhanced energy absorption and fracture toughness. Thomas and co-workers elucidated how the mechanical characteristics depended on the relative density, including anisotropic deformation, elastic moduli, the elastic deformation limit, plastic deformation modes, and energy dissipation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> They used a photo-cross-linkable epoxy resin (SU-8, Microchem) to fabricate epoxy nanoframes through multiple beam interference lithography with UV laser beams (<span class="italic">λ</span> = 355 nm). After exposure, the sample was then baked to initiate cross-linking in the high exposure areas, and the uncross-linked areas were subsequently washed out in a development process, leading to the formation of a well-ordered nanoporous material. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig48">Fig. 48a</a>, the loads were applied by a diamond spherical indenter with the same rate of loading and unloading. Periodic bicontinuous nanoscale networks show several distinctive mechanical characteristics compared to traditional randomly structural cellular materials. Because of their anisotropic nature, spherical indentation deformation leads to a 3-fold symmetric residual indent and a modulus-relative density scaling exponent of 1.26. The modulus of nanoscale networks does not change monotonically with their relative density, instead the modulus exhibits a transition point near a relative density of 0.65, and the energy dissipation also transitions at this same relative density. Moreover, reducing the relative density to 0.50 results in the nanoscale networks dissipating 25% more energy per unit volume than for a relative density of 0.75 (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig48">Fig. 48b</a>). The moduli derived from the larger load (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 1.2 mN) are not sensitive to the relative density, giving higher values than those determined from the lower load (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 0.6 mN). They simulated the representative volume elements of the nanoframe microstructures to identify the deformation mechanisms underlying the transition in the modulus and dissipation with relative density, as well as underlying the remarkable energy dissipation per unit volume achieved in these structures. These simulations found that there was a transition from shear-compression combined with deformation to a shear-dominant one as the relative density decreased below 0.65; these same deformation modes provided the enhanced energy dissipation, suggesting alternative microstructural designs for achieving and optimizing the energy dissipation. In other words, nanoscale networks with well-ordered nanopores can lead to better energy absorption.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">By biomimicking from biological composites, Thomas and co-workers further demonstrated the mechanical behavior of an interpenetrating carbon–epoxy periodic submicrometer-scale bicontinuous composite material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> Biological composites, including bones, fish scales, and nacres, demonstrate exceptional protection performance <span class="italic">via</span> their intricate 3D submicrometer-scale architectures.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> There are several design rules required for outstanding biological composites, such as (i) a combination of hard and soft materials for strength and toughness, (ii) structural anisotropic materials should be oriented in a desired direction for enhanced performance, (iii) strong 3D interlocking of phases is needed for load sharing and energy dissipation, and (iv) submicrometer scale architecture with flaw insensitivity should be used. Thomas and co-workers investigated three different classes of submicrometer-scale networks: epoxy-A–air, pyrolyzed carbon–air, and pyrolyzed carbon–epoxy-B composites, and focused on their energy absorption characteristics (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig49">Fig. 49a</a>). An assessment of the energy absorption capabilities of the three types of structures was performed by carrying out microscopic uniaxial compression tests of the pillar-shaped test regions, presenting a well-defined compression volume without imposing significant strain gradients. After the compression, all the micropillars were completely crushed to estimate the maximum attainable energy absorption (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig49">Fig. 49b</a>). In contrast to the epoxy-A–air and pyrolyzed carbon–air composites, the fragments of the carbon–epoxy-B composite are more retained at the collapsed site, because of the more brittle carbon fragments contained in the epoxy-B phase. From the stress and strain results, direct comparison of the three different types of pillars in terms of modulus and compressive strength is possible. Interestingly, all the pillars can undergo significant compression to over 10% strain without failure (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig49">Fig. 49c</a>). This behavior primarily resulted from the carbonized epoxy-A itself, because of the 14% strain at a yield point in the compression tests of the solid carbon pillars. Also, several major collapse events do not cause the total failure of the pillar. Exceptionally high specific energy absorption values were observed in all the nanoscale networks: epoxy-A–air (310–370 kJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), pyrolyzed carbon–air (380–570 kJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), and pyrolyzed carbon–epoxy-B (470–720 kJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig49">Fig. 49d</a>. These values are considerably higher than for other advanced energy absorption materials (30–275 kJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). The higher value of the specific energy absorption of pyrolyzed carbon–air over epoxy-A–air can be attributed to a change in the basic material from polymer to carbon. On the other hand, the 25% increase in the specific energy absorption of the two-phase bicontinuous pyrolyzed carbon–epoxy-B composite over the pyrolyzed carbon–air results from the synergic effect <span class="italic">via</span> introduction of the polymer phase. Interphase interactions, including stress transfer and strain sharing, are essential to make the composite system defect-insensitive and to enhance its specific energy absorption. In other words, significantly improved energy absorbing materials are possible by exploiting the periodic bicontinuous frame architecture, which offers practical opportunities to develop high-performance protective films by mechanically fusing two different materials with high specific area into an interlocked topology. As numerous geometrical and material variations are possible, this approach may become an important method to achieve unprecedented artificial nanocomposite materials in the future.</p>

      <h2 id="sect1418"><span class="a_heading">6. Concluding remarks and perspective</span></h2>
      <span>Although the manufacturing process of using templated synthesis is an ancient skill and the fabrication of complicated and delicate sculptures with fine details can be achieved by such an approach on a large scale, it is highly challenging and requires sophisticated technologies to fabricate materials in the nanoscale. Even with rapid advances in technology, the preparation of nanomaterials, in particular with well-ordered textures, remains challenging for the development of procedures providing a rational design of tailor-made structures and the incorporation of customized functionalities while retaining sufficient stability of the mechanical and thermal properties. In contrast to the limitations in size and the time-consuming nature of the processing from top-down methods for nanostructure fabrication, bottom-up (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, self-assembly) approaches are able to create nanostructured materials with delicate shapes and a high degree of order, and even controlled orientation, in a facile and swift way. For the fabrication of well-ordered nanomaterials by templated syntheses, self-assembling approaches can be simply classified into hard and soft templates on the basis of the development procedures carried out for the templated syntheses. The use of pre-prepared templates is a hard templating approach. By contrast, using amphiphilic molecules as structure-directing agents for the formation of nanostructured materials in one step is a soft templating approach. While the soft templating approach possesses simple and easy structural formation, it is difficult for large areas and for the controlled orientation of forming ordered nanostructures, due to its complicated phase behaviors. A much more direct method for the preparation of nanostructured materials with controlled pore size, shape formation, and order, as well as orientation from templated syntheses, is to use pre-formed templates. On the basis of the material properties of the templates, in contrast to the use of inorganic templates such as silica- and carbon-based templates, templates made of self-assembled molecules or polymers are referred to as organic templates. Note that it is also much easier to remove the organic templates completely without causing damage to the filling materials, because the fillers for hybridization usually possess distinct properties with the organic matrix. Organic materials can be degraded through hydrolysis, ozone decomposition, UV degradation, reactive ion etching, and calcination. By consideration of the templates with easily degradable properties but sufficient mechanical strength, nanoporous polymers are usually excellent candidates as templates. Also, it is much easier to create a monolith of nanomaterials with a large area, especially in the thin-film state, due to the easy processing of polymeric materials. For the fabrication of nanoporous polymers, one of the most convenient ways is to use degradable BCPs for the self-assembly to create well-ordered nanostructured phases, followed by the preferential removal of the constituent components in BCPs through degeneration, as described above.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">For the fabrication of 3D nanohybrids with complex ordered structures and self-supporting nanoporous materials, DG from the self-assembly of BCPs is especially appealing. After selective degeneration of the minor phase, the DG nanostructure can be exploited to create fully interconnected nanochannels, leading to great potential for the fabrication of inorganic network nanostructures from different templated syntheses. Because of their high porosity and large specific surface area, nanoporous materials resulting from the templating of gyroid are very promising for use in a variety of applications. Unfortunately, the gyroid morphology, which has a kind of multi-continuous structure, occurs over rather limited areas of the phase portrait, essentially in narrow slivers on either side of the diagram between the cylinders and lamellae. A facile method to acquire the DG phase from the self-assembly of chiral block copolymers (BCPs*), polystyrene-<span class="italic">b</span>-poly(<span class="small_caps">L</span>-lactide) (PS-PLLA) is therefore suggested. A wide region for the formation of DG can be found in the phase diagram of the BCPs*, suggesting that the helical phase (H*) from the self-assembly of BCPs* can serve as a stepping stone for the formation of the DG, due to its easy path for the order-order transition from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional (network) structure. Moreover, our recent studies found that the order-order transition from metastable H* to stable DG can be expedited by blending the PS-PLLA with a compatible entity. Owing to the use of the low-molecular-weight oligomer, the increase in the BCP chain mobility in the blends significantly reduces the transformation time for the order-order transition from H* to DG. Consequently, by taking advantage of the degradable character of the PLLA, nanoporous gyroid inorganic materials can be fabricated using hydrolyzed PS-PLLA blends as a template for many reactions, such as the sol–gel reaction, electroplating, electroless plating and atomic layer deposition, followed by removal of the PS matrix. Most importantly, well-defined nanostructured phases can be tailored by the molecular engineering of synthetic BCPs to obtain promising features for applications in nanotechnologies, in particular by exploiting nanostructured gyroid thin films with controlled orientation and thickness over a large area. In contrast to the use of degradable BCPs, well-ordered nanoporous polymers can be fabricated by using solvents for dissolution of the constituent components to create the pore structures or for evaporation-induced pore formation in BCP systems. However, control of the intrinsic texture for the porous structure or pore texture formation and corresponding orientation, in particular in the thin-film state, may require dedicated approaches or processing. Moreover, the formation of well-defined 3D textures or porous textures remains challenging using BCP as a structure-directing material, since it strongly relies on the well-controlled kinetics process for microphase separation from sophisticate phase behaviors. As a result, the use of self-assembled morphologies directly from degradable BCPs has become as templates for fabricating well-defined nanostructured materials. Certainly, this approach will require additional research efforts in terms of researching appropriate methods for removal of the degradable component. Moreover, for the controlled orientation of a DG nanostructure, as demonstrated recently by our laboratory, the controlled ordering of gyroid thin films on a neutral substrate can be achieved by solvent annealing. With the use of appropriate solvents, it is possible to acquire a thin-film sample with a thermodynamically stable gyroid thin film with the (211) plane parallel to the air surface and also to the functionalized substrate, giving a DG template with a specific orientation. In contrast to the well-ordered bicontinuous structures such as gyroid, disordered bicontinuous nanoporous materials can be fabricated by templating with BCPs. This class of porous material has been investigated rather extensively, and this type of nanoporous medium also carries many of its advantages in specific applications without the constraints associated with aligning cylinders or hitting the restricted regions where the gyroid is found.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">For templated syntheses, the fully-developed nanochannels from prepared BCP templates can provide enough space for a high loading of inorganic fillers, thus giving a free-standing and well-defined inorganic nanostructure after removal of the matrix, and also a controlled order and orientation can be achieved before the conduction of templated syntheses. Most importantly, there are many syntheses available using pre-made templates as nanoreactors for controlled reactions. Nevertheless, how to pore-fill the template with reactive agents is usually critical for the successful templating and requires extensive efforts for control of the pore-filling to overcome the blocking problem caused by large gel formation from the sol–gel reaction, the concentration gradient for electroplating, and nucleation and chemical deposition from the outer surface of the template for electroless plating and atomic layer deposition, respectively. For templated electroplating, with the use of the templates deposited on conductive substrates, metal-based and ceramic-based nanomaterials, and even semi-conductive nanomaterials with gyroid-forming morphologies, can be successfully fabricated. In contrast to templated electroplating, the formation of a variety of metallic materials through nucleation and growth processes can be achieved by electroless plating without the application of an electric field for the reduction of metal ions, providing the feasibility to fabricate micrometer particles with nanoporous textures and multibranched metallic materials. The templated sol–gel reaction is a very comprehensive method to fabricate a variety of ceramic nanomaterials, because of the sophisticated development of sol–gel sciences (many available recipes for the sol–gel reaction). In the case of templated ALD, with appropriate control of the diffusion problem for the precursors, it is highly possible to fabricate tubular and even core–shell textures, due to the controllable deposition rate from the reaction cycles. Consequently, free-standing, well-ordered nanoporous inorganics with specific functions for appealing applications can be fabricated by removal of the polymer matrix from the fabricated organic–inorganic nanohybrids due to its self-supporting character.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The gyroid-forming materials from BCP templating can give stable, homogeneous and isotropic materials, thus giving it promising properties for many applications. As a result, gyroid-forming nanoporous materials can be applied in optoelectronics (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, solar cells), energy storage, catalysis, and sensing because of their homogeneous structures with high porosity and large specific surface area. Moreover, nanoporous gyroid materials can be surface-functionalized to extend their applications in many fields, such as in drug delivery, due to the precise control on pore size, improved therapeutic efficiency, and specificity, by addressing the free-standing environment-selective delivery system. Most importantly, the gyroid is a well-ordered structure with specific structural characters (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, well-ordered 3D networks) that give it novel optical and photonic characteristics, as well as good mechanical properties with a free-standing structure. As demonstrated for nanoporous gyroid SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the porosity of the nanoporous gyroid SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements is approximately 66%, giving a low refractive index as low as 1.1, leading to a significant antireflection property in the whole visible spectrum, due to its low refraction and ordered texture. Therefore, nanoporous gyroid SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> thin films can be utilized in many appealing applications, such as antireflection structured materials that have high transmission, low reflection properties, and superior environmental resistance. Most importantly, unlike antireflective materials made from moth-eye structures, the low reflectivity of the nanoporous gyroid SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is evident over the complete spectral range of visible light. Also, with manipulation of the shifting network (a physical method instead of a chemical approach like the butterfly uses to break the inversion symmetry between the two coherent networks in DG structure), the formed nanoporous SG-like TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is expected to have nanophotonic behaviors, similar to the optical properties of a butterfly wing structure, in which the reflective wavelength is equivalent to the dimension of the nanostructured gyroid. For optical applications, it is also noted that disordered bicontinuous nanoporous materials may possess the advantages of short-range order for photonic applications, such as broadband reflection and scattering enhanced light absorption, as well as high reflectance with angle independence. As a result, it is promising to use BCPs as templates for the formation of nanoporous materials by tuning the forming structures in the long-range and short-range order for practical applications.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">One of the most exciting research areas involves exploiting the BCP templating to create ordered nanohybrids and nanoporous materials for the properties of metamaterials. In contrast to photonic crystals where the period is commensurate with the target range of wavelengths of light, metamaterials have been developed – a new concept of artificial structures ranging from several times to several orders smaller than the targeted wavelength. There should involve many interesting behaviors, in particular the chiral photonic of the metamaterials, being suggested but not much of anything yet is really convincing experimentally on novel photonics that can be enabled by chiral materials, especially 3D chiral materials. The gyroid has chiral networks. With the development of the platform technology for the fabrication of diverse gyroid nanohybrids and nanoporous materials, it is possible to take advantage of the chiral properties of the gyroid structure. Many novel properties, such as negative refraction and circular polarization-dependent properties, can be expected for use in applications such as in superlenses, chiroptics and sub-wavelength imaging, because of the chiral character and repeating patterns of the gyroid structure; metallic gyroid materials can also be seen as candidates for chiral metamaterial devices. How to control the chirality of gyroid structure becomes essential for those applications, but currently remains a challenge.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another long standing challenge is to understand the confinement principles of BCP-directed templated syntheses even at the molecular level. In addition, from an application point of view, the development of simple and scalable procedures for the construction of well-ordered porous materials with hierarchical structures at different organization levels is particularly appealing in many cases, since the hierarchical pores are expected to synergistically exhibit the advantage of each class of pore. The final goal is to merge concepts and tools from different methodologies and complex components together for the development of well-ordered nanohybrids and nanoporous materials with innovative properties targeting selected applications, and resulting from the effects of size and shape on the nanoscale, and the functions of order and controlled orientation from the forming arrays, as well as the appealing functions and complexity that come from the well-ordered structures and morphologies.</p>
