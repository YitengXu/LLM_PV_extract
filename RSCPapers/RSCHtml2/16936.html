        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> opened discussion of the paper by Andreas Petzold: Could you please clarify your definition of clear sky?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> responded: In the IAGOS data set, clear sky is defined operationally by the lower detection limit of the backscatter cloud probe (BCP) for ice crystal number concentrations. We estimate the lower threshold for cloud particle detection as a count rate of 1 ice particle per second, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, 4 particles are sampled within the temporal resolution of 4 s. This sampling rate corresponds to a minimum detectable number concentration of 0.015 cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>, but with a sampling uncertainty of 50% according to Poisson statistics. Given by the digital resolution of the instrument, we consider samples with <span class="italic">N</span><small><sub>ice</sub></small> &lt; 0.001 cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> as zero-count events, or clear-sky, respectively. Observations in the grey zone between the two concentration values of 0.001 cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> and 0.015 cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> are categorized as “indeterminate events”, which cannot be unambiguously identified as clouds, but neither can they be identified as cloud-free. However, it has to be noted that more sophisticated research-grade cloud physics instruments are capable of measuring ice particle number concentrations as low as 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>, which corresponds to 1 ice particle per 10 litres of air. In that sense, our “clear-sky” observations may likely contain samples of very thin ice clouds which, however, are very difficult to observe anyway.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Roderic Jones</span> asked: You showed a region of measurements which showed high levels of supersaturation – what level of updraft velocity do you need to maintain that?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> responded: High levels of ice supersaturation of the order of 140% and more require updraft velocities well above 1 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. These observations are mainly associated with deep convective clouds over the subtropics and tropics, whereas we see these events only very rarely in the mid-latitudes.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Roderic Jones</span> said: Following on from my previous question, have you tested a model of cloud formation with the updraft velocities you mentioned and produced those levels of supersaturation? You then showed a satellite image pointing out that the regions of supersaturation coincided with deep convection.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> responded: Modelling studies for IAGOS observations of cirrus clouds have not been conducted yet, but are in preparation. Krämer and colleagues<small><sup>1</sup></small> used the detailed microphysical box model MAID (Model for aerosol and ice dynamics), which can be operated along idealized or realistic atmospheric air parcel trajectories for simulating cirrus climatologies. In these model studies, RH<small><sub>ice</sub></small> values above 140% are found for updraft velocities larger than 1 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. We refer to these model studies when interpreting our observations. As you can see in this satellite image of an example flight of an IAGOS aircraft, regions of high supersaturation coincide with deep convection which is confirmed by the box model studies.</p>

        <span class="bold">Hugh Coe</span> commented: Andreas, it is great to see such a comprehensive dataset delivering some excellent results that simply couldn’t be obtained in any other way than utilising regular commercial flights. By their nature, the flights are taking place in fairly heavily used corridors, to what extent (in mid latitudes especially) does contrail-induced cirrus occur, how did you diagnose it and assess the size of any resulting bias?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> answered: Contrail and contrail-induced cirrus are, of course, an inherent component of cirrus clouds, particularly in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, where most of the air traffic occurs. IAGOS does not allow the direct identification of contrails since due to the horizontal and vertical spacing of the aircraft by air traffic control, the instruments see mainly aged and diluted contrails. One outstanding feature of contrails compared to cirrus is the high concentration of ice particles, at least in young contrails. We used this criterion to search for patterns of contrails in our data set of the North Atlantic Flight Corridor. Looking only at dense cirrus with <span class="italic">N</span><small><sub>ice</sub></small> &gt; 1 cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>, we found a bi-modal probability distribution of RH<small><sub>ice</sub></small>, which is similar to results from dedicated contrail studies by research aircraft. For the cirrus clouds with <span class="italic">N</span><small><sub>ice</sub></small> &lt; 1 cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>, the RH<small><sub>ice</sub></small> distribution is almost similar to that of natural cirrus clouds. We conclude that dense cirrus over the mid-latitudes (2% over the North Atlantic, 3% over the North Pacific), are very likely associated with contrail-cirrus. The potential contribution of contrails to less dense cirrus (<span class="italic">N</span><small><sub>ice</sub></small> &lt; 1 cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>), however, cannot be quantified since atmospheric ageing makes contrails indistinguishable from natural cirrus. Overall, aviation-induced cirrus has become an inherent part of global cloudiness and should not be seen as a bias but as one component among others.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Hugh Coe</span> asked: What proportion of the North Atlantic troposhere is not influenced by contrails or contrail generated cirrus? Which region is least perturbed?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> replied: Contrails are mainly found in the region of the North Atlantic Flight Corridor (40°N–60°N, 65°W–5°W). Whereas most of the westbound flights take routes north of the polar jet stream and fly in the dry lowermost stratosphere where contrails cannot form, the eastbound flights take more southern routes in the uppermost troposphere where contrails are very likely to form. Concerning the height range, contrails are observed from 9 km altitude upwards. In that respect, we consider the uppermost troposphere of the North Atlantic Flight Corridor to be influenced by contrails whereas there may be regions in the southern part of the North Atlantic which are affected by aviation only marginally. Finding an air mass over the North Atlantic which hasn’t seen an influence of aviation during a considerable period of time, however, might be almost impossible.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Daniel Knopf</span> said: This is a very nice data set of ambient ice crystal numbers as a function of RH<small><sub>ice</sub></small>. How do your measured ice crystal numbers relate to measured or parameterized/predicted concentrations of ice nuclei (IN) or ice nucleating particles (INPs) in, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, cirrus clouds? In other words, can the number of IN or INPs explain the measured ambient ice crystal concentration? Could this data set be applied to test the RH<small><sub>ice</sub></small> dependent prediction of IN number concentrations?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> responded: In our observations, there is no direct link between <span class="italic">N</span><small><sub>ice</sub></small> and INP since the IAGOS aerosol instrument package is not yet in place. Referring to a very recent contribution to an AMS monograph on “Ice Formation and Evolution in Clouds and Precipitation: Measurement and Modeling Challenges”,<small><sup>1</sup></small> the range of published INP concentrations and the range of observations of ice particles from research aircraft campaigns using the Jülich NIXE instrument and from IAGOS cirrus observations agree reasonably well. It has to be noted, however, that particularly for cirrus clouds it is difficult to establish a direct link between INP and <span class="italic">N</span><small><sub>ice</sub></small>, since ice particles in cirrus may form by heterogeneous freezing on INP, or by homogeneous freezing of solution droplets. In case of liquid origin cirrus, the situation is even more complex since ice particles will form from previously liquid droplets during cloud glaciation processes. Testing the RH<small><sub>ice</sub></small>-dependent prediction of INP may be a possibility for well-defined cases of which we know air mass history and INP concentration. However, it is probably not an option for the global data set because here we would have to work on a statistical basis.</p>

        <span class="bold">Christopher Kampf</span> responded: Indeed, we found an increased radical yield for the dissolution of mixed SOA/dust samples at lower pH values. In the atmosphere, the pH at the surface of dust particles might also be influenced by coagulation with more acidic SOA particles or condensation of acidic compounds onto the dust particles. Nevertheless, the global influence of pH on the radical formation of mixed SOA/dust particles is beyond the scope of this study and clearly needs further investigations of laboratory experiments and atmospheric modeling.</p>

        <span class="bold">Christopher Kampf</span> answered: This is an excellent question. We think the major contribution to the observed radical formation was due to the dissolution of metal ions from the dust particles due to Fenton reactions, as the kinetic model can reproduce the observed ROS formation rates by considering this process (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Fig. 5). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of the dust surface acting as a heterogeneous catalyst to accelerate the chemistry.

Currently there are at least 5 techniques that quantify ROS or a “general oxidising capacity” of aerosol particles.

We agree with this point very much and would recommend conducting method comparison studies to check the consistency of the results obtained using the different techniques available for ROS quantification and characterization, too. Different techniques may measure different types of ROS and we need to be very careful on comparing ROS measured by different techniques.

        <span class="bold">Christopher Kampf</span> replied: This is a very good point. While both cited studies applied the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay to evaluate the oxidative potential and redox activity of different SOA extracts (or water-soluble PM<small><sub>2.5</sub></small>), we specifically investigated the formation of individual radical type ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radical ions, as well as oxygen- and carbon-centered organic radicals. We would like to point out that even though DTT decay rates are a good indicator of oxidative potential, the connection between DTT decay rates and toxicity and mortality is still unclear. There are many endpoints to investigate adverse health effects (oxidative potential, ROS formation, cellular response, inflammatory indicators, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) and it is not an easy task to bridge the gap between other studies.

As described in the manuscript, EPR spectra are rather complicated and need to be fitted and simulated, so that concentrations of different radicals (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, OH, superoxide, organic radicals) can be quantified. While trapping efficiencies of OH and superoxide are relatively well understood, the trapping efficiency of organic radicals (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, RO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, RO, R radicals) may vary depending on their structure and remain uncertain.

        <span class="bold">Andreas Petzold</span> replied: In the case of IAGOS, we are focusing on the observation of essential climate variables for which mature measurement technologies are available. Our instrumentation challenges result more from the very strict safety requirements for the operation of instruments on board civil aircraft, and from the demand for autonomous and unattended operation over a period of at least two months. These two aspects determine the technologies applicable to our infrastructure. In case we decide for a new parameter to add to our portfolio, we review existing measurement technologies of sufficient maturity, select the most appropriate one and adapt the technology to our needs concerning safety, autonomous operation and available space and power supply. And then we have to enter the process of aeronautical certification, which can last quite a long time, depending on the instrument setup. The next challenge for IAGOS will be to respond to the increasing requests for global air quality data. Here, we currently prepare a new instrument for simultaneous observations of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter which are two key observables concerning air quality. Overall, IAGOS expects to benefit strongly from the rapidly growing field of instrument miniaturization.</p>

        <span class="bold">Andrew Rickard</span> remarked: Related to both previous comments on the use of cyclohexane to scavenge OH radicals, monitoring the formation of cyclohexanone in order to quantitatively assess OH yields from alkene ozonolysis, the peroxy radical chemistry involved is complex (see mechanism provided in Alam <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small>) and system dependent (both reactant and experimental condition dependent). A range of yields of cyclohexanone from the OH oxidation of cyclohexane have also been reported (0.26–0.53), owing to system dependent fluxes through the RO<small><sub>2</sub></small> + HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> channel (forming cyclohexyl-hydroperoxide) <span class="italic">vs.</span> competing RO<small><sub>2</sub></small> + RO<small><sub>2</sub></small> chemistry. Therefore, variations in derived OH yields may occur if applied to systems where the concentrations of HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and/or RO<small><sub>2</sub></small> present differ greatly from those under which the cyclohexanone yields from cyclohexane + OH were originally determined – see Alam <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> for a more detailed discussion on this.</p>

Furthermore, Presto and Donahue performed calculations for the analogous CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>OO + NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> system, which suggested that an adduct (a nitrite-type peroxy radical, ONOCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>OO) may be important in the formation of NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> in this system. This structure is analogous to Isomer #3 in Fig. 9 of your paper. This is notable because this is the isomer for which calculated and experimental values of adiabatic ionization energy at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 106 are closest and differ mainly in the detail that this ion is expected to fragment rather than be observed at the parent mass. As a consequence, my overall impression is that Presto and Donahue’s observations are not contradicted, but rather, are supported by your new results, and that you are providing important insights into the mechanism by which NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> is produced in the atmosphere by these systems.</p>

        <span class="bold">Rebecca Caravan</span> responded: Thank you for your comment. In our lower pressure experiments (up to 40 Torr), we see a decrease in the acetaldehyde signal as a function of [NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>], which at 20 Torr, we utilize to give an upper limit to the yield of acetaldehyde + NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> as 30%. However, over the whole pressure range of our experiments (4–40 Torr) we observe signal at the exact <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> consistent with the Criegee–NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adduct in both the formaldehyde oxide and acetaldehyde oxide + NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> systems. Given this reaction appears to proceed <span class="italic">via</span> a simple reverse unimolecular mechanism, I would anticipate that higher pressures would favor increased stabilization of the Criegee–NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adduct, and therefore competing bimolecular channels would be suppressed with increasing pressure. With regards to the structure of the adduct – we are not in fact able to assign the observed adduct signal to isomer #3. As mentioned, the calculations predict dissociative ionization of isomer #3, meaning that little to no signal would be observed at the parent mass, which is in conflict with the present observations. The structure of the adduct may hold a clue to its ultimate fate (in other words, whether it will likely decompose to NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>). Dr Ewa Papajak and Dr Ivan Antonov have carried out further, higher level calculations on the potential adduct structures (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> here), and in fact observe significantly different predicted ionization energies at this level. Still, the calculations at the CCSD(T)-F12//DFT level find no isomers with ionization energies consistent with the observed experimental signal (and additionally, which do not fragment on ionization), therefore it is apparent that further work is needed to assign the structure(s) of the adduct. It may indeed be possible that more than one isomer of the adduct is formed, and these adducts may have different fates. Rate theory calculations on this system would be highly beneficial to assess whether more than one adduct isomer may be formed in the reaction, and to predict the pressure- and temperature-dependent fates of each of these adducts.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rebecca Caravan</span> replied: I think the difference between Criegee intermediate and peroxy reactivity lies in the difference in their electronic structure – Criegee intermediates are mostly zwitterionic in nature and so can be expected to react differently to peroxy radicals. With regards to the conversion of the adduct to bimolecular products, this is an interesting question and one which requires further laboratory and theoretical investigations to unravel. It is possible that the adduct could undergo decomposition, but in the atmosphere other fates such as deposition, photolysis or further reaction may happen on a shorter timescale than unimolecular decomposition, and so these adducts may be intercepted before formation of NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> can occur. Alternatively, if these adducts do decompose to aldehyde species + NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> on a significantly longer timescale without further perturbation, then they may serve as a transport mechanism for NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/NO<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>.</p>

        <span class="bold">Rebecca Caravan</span> responded: Thanks for this very interesting question. Criegee intermediates have been shown to react in a number of ways. For example, in the reaction of formaldehyde oxide with SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<small><sup>1</sup></small> it behaves as an oxidant whereby the terminal oxygen on the Criegee moiety is transferred to the co-reactant leading to SO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and formaldehyde. However, for the same reaction with larger Criegee intermediates (such as acetone oxide), the observed pressure dependence of the rate coefficient by Huang <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> has led to postulation that the Criegee–SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> addition complex may be an important product.<small><sup>3</sup></small> Conversely, in other systems such as reactions with acids, evidence for an insertion-type mechanism has been observed,<small><sup>4</sup></small> and addition mechanisms are postulated for the reaction of Criegee intermediates with peroxy radicals.<small><sup>5,6</sup></small> These examples of the varied reactivity of the Criegee intermediate serve to illustrate that it is perhaps not too instructive at this stage to think of it as exhibiting ion-molecule or peroxy radical-like chemistry, and to be guided by continuing theoretical work and previous experimental observations.</p>

        <span class="bold">Craig Taatjes</span> remarked: I point out that there are reasons to doubt that Criegee intermediates should react similarly to alkylperoxy radicals. The ground electronic configuration of the carbonyl oxides is dominantly a closed-shell singlet zwitterion, whereas the alkylperoxy species is a doublet radical. The reactions of Criegee intermediates with radical species like NO are not rapid as would be expected if they had substantial radical character (the reaction of CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>OO with NO is at least 100 times slower than the reaction of CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OO with NO). It may seem somewhat surprising that a closed-shell singlet should react rapidly with other closed-shell species (but the Criegee intermediates do). Ravi just suggested that the Criegee intermediates’ zwitterionic character may be important; capture processes in reactions of Criegee intermediates with dipolar reaction partners are explored in more detail in one of the posters, presented by Rabi Chhantyal-Pun, where it is shown that long-range forces likely do contribute in Criegee intermediate reactions.</p>

The observation of time-and [NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>]-dependent signal at the exact mass corresponding to the Criegee–NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adducts, and the decrease in the corresponding aldehyde signal as a function of [NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>] provide the main body of evidence for the conclusions drawn in the paper.

The temperatures utilized to convert N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> to NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> are higher than would be pertinent atmospherically, and so it is not possible to deduce from this work alone that the adduct would thermally decompose under atmospheric conditions.

As seen in Fig. 1 in the manuscript, <span class="italic">e</span><small><sub>NH<small><sub>4</sub></small></sub></small> concentrations of up to 0.4 μg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small> could be measured <span class="italic">e.g.</span> during the Zeppelin flights and in the beginning of July.

        <span class="bold">Jacqueline Hamilton</span> asked: Can you explain the reason for the 2<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 ratio expected in Fig. 6?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> replied: We have to emphasize that this ratio is an AMS measurement specific one. As mentioned in the manuscript, carboxylic acid groups fragment within the AMS to equal amounts of CO<small><sup>+</sup></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ions.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Note that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> is also produced from gas phase CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the AMS. This contribution was accounted for by periodical gas background measurements using a HEPA filter mounted inline in the AMS inlet. Assuming that each available carboxylic acid group combines with an excess-NH<small><sub>4</sub></small> molecule <span class="italic">via</span> an acid–base reaction, a ratio of neNH<small><sub>4</sub></small> to nOrgCO<small><sub>2</sub></small> of 2 would be expected. This is because a carboxylic acid group is fragmented within the AMS either to a CO<small><sup>+</sup></small> or a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ion, with a 50% chance for each case. The Org-CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentrations shown here consider the signal of CO<small><sup>+</sup></small> only. Therefore, the Org-CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentrations given by the AMS data represent 50% of organic acids that can be measured by this instrument.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jacqueline Hamilton</span> questioned: Does the uptake of ammonia with organic acids relate to their p<span class="italic">K</span><small><sub>a</sub></small>?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> answered: Some of the laboratory experiments indicate that the p<span class="italic">K</span><small><sub>a</sub></small> values may positively correlate to the ammonia uptake ability. However, some generated particulate organic acids such as succinic, glutaric and adipic acid, which have relatively low p<span class="italic">K</span><small><sub>a</sub></small>’s, did not uptake the expected amount of ammonia molecules. This is due to the fact that their deliquescence points were above the relative humidity achieved during the experiments (<span class="italic">ca</span>. 75%) which resulted most likely in mainly crystalline particles as described in the manuscript. Thus, additional studies are needed to determine the dependence between the p<span class="italic">K</span><small><sub>a</sub></small> of the organic acids and the ammonia uptake.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> responded: The vertical profile of all species show little dependence on the height above ground. This is in line with trace gases which were found to be relatively well mixed in the respective flights.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> responded: We do assume that through the formation of organic salts the pH of particles is affected. In addition to having potential effects on particle chemistry, we would like to emphasize that the physical state of particles is affected by salt formation with effects ranging from particle lifetime to water uptake and optical properties.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> responded: The flight tracks for vertical profiles were defined such that the Zeppelin avoids flying in its own exhaust plume. This is verified through <span class="italic">e.g.</span> CO measurements onboard the Zeppelin.

        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> remarked: It seems that the organic acid-ammonia “salt” is more strongly bound in the aerosol. Am I right? This brings up a question: Would there be large differences in evaporation rates between organic acid-ammonia and ammonium nitrate?

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> replied: Although our ambient data sets don’t show a significant correlation between the ambient temperatures and excess ammonium, the diurnal pattern of excess ammonium and the inorganic nitrate fraction (which is considered to be ammonium nitrate, see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>) indicate that during the day, the evaporation of ammonium nitrate dominates over its formation, while excess ammonium does not change substantially.</p>

        <span class="bold">Steven Brown</span> asked: How would the organic component change between winter and summer? There is probably a big difference in production of organic acids in summer to winter if they are secondary, but perhaps a smaller change in ammonia emissions. What do you predict the balance of factors to be?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> answered: Indeed, our data set acquired in November 2011 at the Cesar site showed an average SOA contribution of 53% of total organic concentration and 17% to total aerosol mass, respectively, while the ground based AMS data presented here showed 77% and 25% of SOA related to total organics and total aerosols, respectively, between May to July 2012. On the other hand, NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> emissions can have high variation between the seasons, especially at rural sites in North-Western Europe like Cabauw. For example, NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> concentrations around Cabauw were relatively low in winter between 6th January to 18th February 2008 (average: 3.1 μg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small>), followed by a period until 10th March with very high concentrations (average: 21.3 μg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small>) and peaks of up to 87 μg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small> (EBAS database). In summer 2008, the NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> concentrations were 12.1 μg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small>, averaged between May and July. In this context an estimation of the seasonal importance of organic salts in aerosol is not straightforward.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan Williams</span> returned to the paper by Rebecca Caravan and asked: Have you seen any real world evidence of this reaction, for example in places where you would expect high Criegee radical concentrations, have you seen deviations in the NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> relationship?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Steven Brown</span> responded: We have only recently begun to look for evidence of NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> production from Criegee radical oxidation of NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. One place to look is areas with high biogenic VOC emissions that would lead to rapid Criegee radical chemistry. A recent model analysis suggests that the effect is rather small if the primary fate of Criegee radicals is reaction with water vapor, since regions with high biogenic emissions often coincide with high relative humidity. If the water vapor reaction is slower than current laboratory studies indicate, then the models would suggest a substantial (&gt;10%) effect on NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> radical production rates. There is no direct evidence from the field data that we have analyzed to date to support this additional source, however.</p>

        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> opened a general discussion of the papers by Abdelwahid Mellouki, Rebecca Caravan and Astrid Kiendler-Scharr: There have been lots of advances in technology since we used to use ‘smog’ chambers. Now it seems like chambers are coming back alongside other experiments <span class="italic">e.g.</span> on Zeppelins and reactions of isolated reactions. Could you comment on where you think the technology is going next?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Abdelwahid Mellouki</span> replied: Designing field experiments where kinetic parameters and mechanistic schemes could be measured and assessed in the “real world”.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> responded: With respect to strategies for process level studies, one emerging approach for chambers is the use of complex mixtures as a starting point for chemical mechanism exploration. Such approaches use <span class="italic">e.g.</span> direct emissions of plants, vehicles, or ambient air to study secondary pollutant formation under realistic conditions. These approaches imply high sensitivity and selectivity requirements for measurements and allow the exploration of interactions between mechanisms which cannot be studied, when single compounds are used in isolation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stephen Arnold</span> added: In the real atmosphere, if we measure a time series sat in a given location we are often measuring variability driven by air mass origin, not local processing. Zeppelins following air masses could provide an exciting opportunity to follow single air masses and study their processing over time (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> a Lagrangian observational framework).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Barbara Finlayson-Pitts</span> said: Looking back over decades at chamber studies, it has been clear that there are “chamber-specific effects” that undoubtedly involve reactions on the walls. The default position has been that these had to be removed when the chemistry probed in these studies is inserted into models (however, some of these reactions will also occur in air, albeit at different rates and perhaps with different mechanisms). As an example, it has been shown by Ziemann and coworkers that organics get taken up into Teflon and can come back out. We have seen this with halogens on halocarbon wax coatings, which is similar to Teflon. These materials absorb Br<small><sub>2</sub></small>; pumping on it, purging with air, water, even O<small><sub>3</sub></small> gives no indication that Br<small><sub>2</sub></small> is present. However, if Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> is added, Br<small><sub>2</sub></small> appears in the gas phase, apparently due to a competitive displacement reaction. Since all chambers have walls, with the potential for such effects, I would be interested in hearing comments from anyone here about whether we are confident we know what chamber effects are and how to take them out?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> answered: One approach to minimize wall effects that has been successfully followed <span class="italic">e.g.</span> in SAPHIR in Jülich, is the concept of using high volume/surface ratios. Complementarily, the use of steady state reactors can explore wall losses when steady state is disturbed. The use of such combined approaches and dedicated studies of reference systems in multiple chamber studies are ways forward to disentangle chamber wall effects from gas phase reactions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Wahner</span> said: Following on from the discussion about chamber studies, a comment: there have been large improvements in the design and construction of present day atmosphere simulation chambers (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> SAPHIR in Jülich) compared to smog chambers. One important aspect is the wall material and the construction as a double wall with continuous 24/7 flushing of the space between the two foils, which prohibits diffusion from outside trace gases into the chamber and, maybe most important, it flushes out any deposit on the inner wall, products of experiments, as long as they have any vapor pressure and diffuse through the 120 micrometer thick FEP foil. Therefore contamination by outgassing is strongly reduced. Nevertheless, the wall is a surface and will have reactions on it and needs careful characterization experiments repeatedly done. What is impressive with these measurements is the consistency/reproducibility which is obtained. However, chambers need good calibration and characterization to ensure reproducibility and therefore quite a lot of additional work to operate.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andrew Rickard</span> added: The EUROCHAMP-2020 Project (http://www.eurochamp.org), which many of us here are involved with (either directly or indirectly), has recently started. EUROCHAMP-2020 aims at integrating the most advanced European atmospheric simulation chambers into a world-class infrastructure for research and innovation. One of EUROCHAMP2020’s main objectives is to set up a co-ordinated set of networking activities to deliver improved chamber operability across the infrastructure, as well as standard protocols for data generation and analysis. As part of these activities, sets of experiments are being designed and carried out in order to understand chamber specific auxiliary chemistry and photolysis characteristics across all chambers, to achieve better interpretation of experiments and data inter-comparability among different chambers, providing enhanced datasets for use by modellers and for a higher level of integration at the community scale.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan Williams</span> said: Connecting two previous comments regarding chamber studies and Zeppelins – we know that chambers have important surface emission characteristics of species such as HONO due to surface reactions. If we consider the Zeppelin as an inverse chamber, can we not expect the same surface reactions on the skin of the Zeppelin? Would these impact the use of the Zeppelin in the pure motor-off Langrangian studies suggested by Stephen Arnold?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Astrid Kiendler-Scharr</span> replied: As mentioned before the emissions of the Zeppelin engine would certainly be the dominant contamination in such an experiment. In our experiments we see no indication for the surface being a source of <span class="italic">e.g.</span> HONO. As you point out, the experiment would be an “inverse chamber” with an extremely high volume to surface ratio. So as long as sampling is conducted outside the surface boundary layer, the risk of contamination from the surface seems small.</p>

        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> posed a general question: I have a follow up on the question about chemistry on the balloon surface – there are major technological advances in this area. A key question from my perspective is: how do we deal with mixing in Lagrangian experiments?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Stephen Arnold</span> commented: Regarding the idea of using a Lagrangian observational framework, mixing matters, but the amount it matters depends on the timescale you are interested in. We had an experiment in 2004 (ICARTT: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/projects/icartt/), where we were convinced we successfully made several linked Lagrangian air mass interceptions. Mixing was slow compared with the timescales for advection and chemical processing. This was in the upper troposphere. In the boundary layer, faster mixing would make.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Dwayne Heard</span> said: I would like to make a general comment about Criegee radicals and their role in the atmosphere. As some of the papers at this meeting have shown, great advances in have been made in detecting Criegee radicals in the laboratory, in order to study their kinetics (rate coefficients and product branching ratios). When a new measurement of a rate coefficient or branching ratio is made, the values are then inputted into a model of the atmosphere, in order to look at the impact of mixing ratios of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and perhaps the rate of new particle formation or other parameters. However, what we are missing are any quantitative measurements of Criegee radicals in the atmosphere to compare directly with the model calculations. At present we rely on model predictions for distributions of the mixing ratios of these species. There have been some advances recently, for example during OH measurements made with the Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (CIMS) technique, it was noticed that in forested areas, particularly in boreal forests, that the CIMS OH background is large, and thought to be due to Criegee radicals, which convert SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to SO<small><sub>3</sub></small> inside the CIMS instrument (just like OH radicals do). Mauldin <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>1</sup></small> reported a time-series of this background, thought to be from Criegee intermediates, in 2012. More recently, Novelli <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> have exploited a background signal in a laser-induced fluorescence instrument which is assigned to Criegee radicals to provide an estimate of their concentration. An estimate of ∼5–10<small><sup>4</sup></small> molecules cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small> (with an order of magnitude uncertainty) was made for the concentration of Criegee intermediates. These are exciting advances, but the information about levels in the field is still very limited, and further technological innovations are needed in the future.</p>

        <span class="bold">Rebecca Caravan</span> responded: Thank you for your comment. I agree that developments to enable field measurements of Criegee intermediates would be advantageous, and would like to point to two such developments presented at this meeting which are attempting to tackle this difficult problem: the paper by Giorio <span class="italic">et al.</span> (DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C7FD00025A" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/C7FD00025A">10.1039/C7FD00025A</a>) and a poster by Keutsch <span class="italic">et al.</span> entitled “Unambiguous detection of speciated stabilized Criegee intermediates <span class="italic">via</span> gas phase derivatization and detection using proton transfer mass spectrometry”.</p>

        <span class="bold">A. Ravishankara</span> addressed Abdelwahid Mellouki and Rebecca Caravan: Thank you for your interesting papers. Clearly, the studies on the reactivity of Criegee intermediates are very interesting and have been a new frontier in gas phase chemistry. In your views, what are the other new frontiers in gas phase chemistry?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Abdelwahid Mellouki</span> replied: Many challenges still lie ahead to understand the atmospheric gas phase chemistry. For example:</p>
      <p class="otherpara">While the chemistry of RO<small><sub>2</sub></small> has been subject to decades of laboratory studies, the nature and the yields of the products from the reactions involving RO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are still unclear at a certain level under atmospheric conditions. Alkoxy radicals chemistry, particularly for oxygenated molecules, needs more characterization.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The atmospheric radical budget is another issue, how to explain the differences between the models and the field measurements for OH radicals for example.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The formation processes of HOMs (Highly Oxygenated Molecules) and their atmospheric fate are of interest for both gas and particle phases.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Photolysis of many organic compounds is still not well characterized under atmospheric conditions (photolysis rates and quantum yields).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">More generally, studies under realistic atmospheric conditions (initial concentrations, temperature, pressure, solar radiations) would enhance the ability to develop comprehensive and capable atmospheric models.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rebecca Caravan</span> responded: I think we still have a lot to learn about Criegee intermediate chemistry. For example, the reactivity of larger and functionalized Criegee intermediates, which are difficult to generate directly in the laboratory, still remains a question. In terms of other areas of gas phase chemistry, there has been a lot of nice work done on this already (see for example this perspective by Veronica Vaida<small><sup>1</sup></small>) but complexation to water has been demonstrated to perturb reaction rate coefficients, reaction products and photochemical properties in a variety of systems, but there could be more to learn there. Indeed, one might expect a similar impact of water on Criegee intermediate behavior, as shown for example, in the enhanced rate of reaction of formaldehyde oxide with water dimer, with respect to the monomer.<small><sup>2,3</sup></small></p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jos Lelieveld</span> remarked: Regarding Professor Ravishankara’s question about new frontiers: it seems probable that the effects of Criegee intermediates are relatively smaller in a tropical compared to boreal forest, though important in localised areas. OH controls the oxidising capacity of most of the atmosphere, seemingly also over forests; Criegee intermediates are chemically highly interesting but we should probably not overestimate their influence on regional and global scales.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rebecca Caravan</span> communicated in reply: Whilst I agree that the hydroxyl radical is a highly important species in the atmosphere, I feel this does not negate the potential importance of Criegee intermediate chemistry, which, at present, is much less well studied than that of OH. Criegee intermediates have not only been implicated in the removal of important atmospheric pollutants (SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for example), but their reaction products may be an (as of yet) unaccounted for pathway towards particulate formation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Christian George</span> asked: During this session, a certain emphasis was given to the chemistry of the Criegee intermediates, but what about other oxidative pathways such as “auto-oxidation”? Are those still to be considered as a “hot-topic”? In other words, what would be possible future priorities in terms of research in gas phase homogeneous chemistry?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Abdelwahid Mellouki</span> responded: The atmospheric chemistry of HOMs (Highly Oxygenated Molecules) is indeed a hot topic at present as they may be a sink to a number of organic radicals leading to new particle formation. Their formation processes and their atmospheric fate under different conditions still need to be studied using new state of the art instrumentation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Andreas Wahner</span> remarked: Further to this discussion about atmospheric chemistry processes and the question of which processes need to be further studied, or “what are the unknown unknowns”, I want to point out that the mentioned auto oxidation mechanisms are very important but we have to clarify what are the important overall issues or quantitative unresolved questions. Auto oxidation reactions are important for the pathway from gas phase to SOA and oxidizing emissions without NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> fueled radical recycling and therefore without, as far as we know, ozone production, but these mechanisms have minor importance in others. For example for those key questions: Do we really understand radical budgets in a global chemical regime? How much carbon leaves the atmosphere as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, partly oxidized, or as the organic phase of aerosols? Certainly also surface reactions play a role at least in the boundary layer.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Craig Taatjes</span> noted: The issues that are being discussed here are similar to those being faced in other areas of complex chemical systems, such as combustion chemistry. One frontier is controlled experiments that can follow sequences of reactions and their connections in detail, including probing intermediate species. These investigations fall between elementary reaction kinetics and more global studies like chamber measurements. Another universal challenge for investigators of complex chemical processes is to deduce the scientifically important features from the overwhelming granularity of a fully elementary description.</p>
