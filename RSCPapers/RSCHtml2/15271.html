Water is required for irrigation in the development of bioenergy, reservoir creation in hydroelectric power generation, drilling and resource displacement in petroleum and gas production, mineral extraction in mining operations, and cooling and processing in thermoelectric power generation. Vehicles powered by petroleum, electricity, natural gas, ethanol, biodiesel, and hydrogen fuel cells consume water resources indirectly through fuel production cycles, and it is important to understand the impacts of these technologies on water resources. Previous investigations of water consumption for transportation fuels have focused primarily on key processes and pathways, ignoring the impacts of many intermediate, inter-related processes used in fuel production cycles. Herein, the results of a life cycle analysis of water consumption for transportation fuels in the United States using an extensive system boundary that includes the water embedded in intermediate processing and transportation fuels are presented. The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model provides a comprehensive framework and system boundary for transportation fuel analysis in the United States. GREET was expanded to include water consumption and used to compare the water consumed per unit energy and per km traveled in light-duty vehicles. Many alternative fuels were found to consume larger quantities of water on a per km basis than traditional petroleum pathways, and it is therefore important to consider the implications of transportation and energy policy changes on water resources in the future.</p></div><hr/>
    
      
      <h2 id="sect230"><span class="a_heading">1 Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>The production of energy exerts an increasingly important influence on natural resources and the environment. Energy production processes consume water resources and accelerate fluxes of water from land surfaces to the atmosphere. Increases in population, energy and food demand now strain previously abundant sources of water. For these reasons, it is important to characterize the relationships between consumption of water resources and the production of energy.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The transportation sector consumed 28% of the total primary energy in the United States (US) in 2013.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> World-wide energy consumption in the transportation sector is projected to increase by 63% from 2010 to 2040.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> A current focus of transportation energy policies in the US and elsewhere is on the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). For example, the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to promote fuels that reduce life cycle GHG emissions relative to conventional fuels,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> and the European Union enacted the Renewable Energy Directive to promote renewable energy production.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> In California, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) calls for a reduction of at least 10% in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> In addition to impacts on GHG emissions, it is increasingly important to consider the impacts of transportation fuels on water resources.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Transportation fuels are produced using interconnected pathways composed of numerous individual production processes. Many of these production processes generate intermediates that are later consumed for the ultimate purpose of generating transportation. Each process in a pathway may consume water resources, so it is necessary to analyze the water consumed throughout the pathway to understand the net impact that a fuel will have on water resources. For example, biodiesel and ethanol production consume water in both the agricultural operations used to produce biomass and in the conversion of the biomass to fuel; thermoelectric power generation consumes water in fuel cycle operations and cooling in thermoelectric power plants; hydroelectric power plants require water-consuming reservoirs to generate electricity; hydrogen fuel cells consume water as a feedstock for the fuel and for cooling excess energy generated by the process; petroleum and natural gas require water for recovery and subsequently for processing.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A complete accounting of the water resource impacts of transportation fuel production necessitates a life cycle analysis (LCA) of the entire supply chain for each production pathway. The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model is an analytical tool that can be used to perform LCAs of transportation fuels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> GREET provides a comprehensive framework for a robust LCA of the impacts of different transportation fuels on water resources.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">LCAs of water consumption are challenging to perform due to differences in definitions and terminology associated with water data. Water that is withdrawn by power plants and other industries is often more easily quantified than the amount of water actually consumed by the process. Many estimates of water resource impacts of production processes are based on withdrawals even when the majority of the water is returned to the watershed or groundwater source where it originated. A large portion of the water consumed in agricultural processes is supplied by precipitation rather than irrigation withdrawals from a water resource. The quantities of water consumed in agricultural processes by precipitation and irrigation are sometimes referred to as the green water and blue water, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Accounting for both the precipitation and irrigation water consumed in agricultural processes overestimates the anthropogenic influence on water resources because indigenous flora consume water in the absence of any agriculture. An additional complication in water accounting is the inherently spatial and temporal variability of the climate, which can affect both production and consumption of water resources in a given location.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The goals of this study were to develop a comprehensive baseline LCA of water resource consumption associated with transportation fuel production, highlight the uncertainties and implications in the results, and identify important outstanding gaps in the data. There have been other LCAs performed on water consumption associated with transportation; however, these analyses ignored the water embedded in many intermediate resources such as transportation fuel and intermediate chemicals<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> or utilized economic input–output modeling to fill process data gaps.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> To fill these gaps in the analysis, an extensive inventory of process-level water consumption factors was developed for the major transportation fuel pathways in the US consistent with the GREET structure. The inventory was then used with the GREET framework to quantitatively estimate the anthropogenic-induced water consumption associated with the various transportation fuels. The results provide extensive and comprehensive analysis into the connections between transportation energy and water resources. The values outlined in this study are not necessarily representative of water consumption for specific projects, however, due to large spatial and temporal variability of water use in energy production processes.</p>
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect248"><span class="a_heading">2 Methodology</span></h2>
      <span>GREET contains estimates of the life cycle energy use and emissions of hundreds of transportation fuel production pathways. The fuels analyzed in this study include petroleum gasoline and diesel, corn-based ethanol, soy-based biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), electricity generated from different sources in the US grid, and compressed hydrogen gas (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>). The results were extended to assess blended fuels including gasoline mixed with 10% corn-based ethanol by volume (E10) and gasoline mixed with 85% corn ethanol by volume (E85) and 20% soybean-based biodiesel (B20) for use in internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). Collectively these fuels account for the majority of current and predicted near-future energy consumption in passenger vehicles in the US.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">The life cycle water consumption associated with the fuels was computed using functional units of L of water per GJ. Electricity generation pathways were also compared in L of water per kW h, and pathways for hydrogen fuel cells were analyzed in L of water per kg H<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The vehicle fuel efficiencies were used to extend the water consumption estimates from an energy basis to units of L of water per 100 kilometers of transportation in light-duty vehicles (LDV) including ICEVs powered by E10, E85, petroleum diesel, soy biodiesel, and B20, compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGV), battery electric vehicles (BEV) using electricity from the major sources in the US grid, and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) powered by hydrogen gas produced from natural gas, electricity, coal, and biomass.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect256"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Definitions of water consumption</span></h3>
        <span>Water is ubiquitous on Earth and is plentiful on a global scale. Freshwater resources on land surfaces, however, are a limited renewable resource. Freshwater resources are produced from precipitation and move across land surfaces where they are consumed naturally by evaporation and transpiration or may be diverted and used to enhance agriculture, capture waste heat in industrial facilities, extract other natural resources, or supply drinking water to municipalities. Definitions of water consumption were taken for consistency with the goal of this analysis, which was to estimate the freshwater consumed for anthropogenic purposes in processes relevant to transportation fuel production in the United States. Water consumption in this context is water withdrawn from a freshwater resource and not returned either because of evaporation, transpiration, deep injection, or major quality degradation. The water consumption accounting and definitions associated with individual fuel supply chain processes were developed for consistency with this definition.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Industrial facilities such as thermoelectric power plants and petroleum refineries require water for cooling and processing. The amount of water withdrawn for industrial processes may be much larger than the amount consumed. While characterization of water withdrawals is important to local ecology, this analysis focused only on water consumption given the context of US average values. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> shows a schematic of the flows of water into and out of a water-consuming facility and the associated definition of water consumption. The quantity of water consumed in industrial facilities is primarily determined by process requirements unlike water use in other processes and as a result water consumption tends to exhibit less spatial and temporal variability.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Agricultural processes require water to enhance the growth of biomass. In agricultural operations, much of the production water requirement can be supplied by precipitation. Irrigation water is often used to improve agricultural yields or make crop production possible. Some of the irrigation water supplied to an agricultural operation returns to surface and groundwater bodies, but the remainder that is consumed represents the primary anthropogenic impact of the process on water resources. For this analysis, water consumption associated with agriculture was defined as the evapotranspiration of water withdrawn for irrigation. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> shows a schematic of the water flows in an agricultural production process. No attempts were made to quantify changes in evapotranspiration associated with land use changes from native grasses and forest to farms.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Mining and recovery operations for petroleum, natural gas, geothermal energy, and other resources require water for drilling, extraction and beneficiation. The amount of water needed to produce a given quantity of petroleum changes over the life cycle of a given well and varies with both the location and the extraction technology utilized. Low-quality (saline) water exists naturally in petroleum reservoirs, and during crude oil recovery some of this water is co-produced with crude oil. Sometimes the produced water is recycled to enhance recovery; other times it is treated; other times it is disposed of through deep well injections as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>. Water consumption for mining and recovery processes was defined as water injected into the reservoirs that originated from outside the formation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The recovery of natural gas from conventional deposits requires water for drilling operations and cooling. Oil and gas-producing shale formations require water for hydraulic fracturing to enable production. Extraction of other minerals requires water for solution mining, beneficiation, and cleaning. The quality of any water used in mining/resource recovery technologies is often substantially diminished and cannot be returned to a water resource. For this analysis, all water withdrawals for mining and recovery operations were assumed to be consumed. The impacts of diminished quality water from mining/recovery operations on local resources and return flows of treated water to resources from mining operations were not quantified.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The construction of dams for generation of electricity from hydropower substantially modifies the hydrology of the associated watershed. Dams permanent modify landscapes from existing natural and/or anthropogenic purposes into artificial reservoirs. The formation of these reservoirs increases the water surface exposed to the atmosphere thereby increasing evaporation from the entire river system. In large river systems with multiple dams, the construction of new dams for hydropower may impact water availability downstream through increased evaporation as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>. For this analysis, the increased evaporation from reservoirs due to hydroelectric power generation was taken as the definition of water consumption.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect271"><span class="b_heading">2.2 System boundaries</span></h3>
        <span>The system boundaries for the life cycle water consumed in the production of the transportation fuels in this study include mining and recovery operations, agricultural production of biomass, agricultural chemicals manufacturing, biofuel conversion, crude oil and natural gas refining and processing, and transportation and distribution. Fuel consumption and the associated life cycle water consumption for processing and transportation was assumed to come from a combination of diesel fuel, gasoline fuel, residual fuel oil, natural gas, coal, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen gas, and electricity from the US electric grid. The water consumed in the construction of infrastructure, the water consumption associated with vehicle manufacturing and disposal, and the impacts of land use changes on water resources were not considered in this assessment. Because of the long lifetime associated with infrastructure, it is unlikely that construction and manufacturing of infrastructure would have a large effect on water consumption.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The production of each of each of these fuels can be conceptualized as a pathway consisting of a series of processes. Because the fuel production from each pathway requires fuel from the other pathways, however, the embedded water in each of the fuels associated with other fundamental process inputs must calculated simultaneously. For example, petroleum refining requires electricity, electricity generation utilizes coal as a feedstock, and coal transportation requires petroleum. Thus in reality all of the pathways are interdependent.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a> shows the various well-to-wheel pathways for the major US transportation fuels characterized in this study. The petroleum fuel pathways (diesel and gasoline blendstock) consist of on-shore or off-shore crude oil recovery or bitumen extraction from oil sands followed by refining. The corn ethanol and soy biodiesel pathways include agricultural chemical production followed by farming and then fuel conversion. The CNG pathway is composed of gas recovery followed by processing and compression. Electricity for BEVs and other production processes is generated at power plants following the fuel production cycle for coal, natural gas, nuclear fuel, and petroleum and renewable resources including hydropower, wind, biomass, municipal waste, geothermal and solar power. Hydrogen can be generated from natural gas using steam methane reforming (SMR), from electricity using electrolysis, or from coal or biomass using gasification. Each of these pathways was extended from pumps to wheels using the associated fuel efficiency, although the water consumption associated with vehicle manufacturing and operation was not included in this analysis. In addition to the water consumed in each process in the various pathways, the GREET framework enables inclusion of the embedded water in the transportation and processing fuels.</p>

        <span>Estimates of the water consumed per unit output for each of the relevant transportation processes were developed from an extensive literature survey, industry data, and analysis of number of publicly-available databases.

        <h3 id="sect299"><span class="b_heading">3.1 Petroleum gasoline and diesel</span></h3>
        <span>Crude oil that is used in petroleum refineries in the United States to produce gasoline and diesel originates from domestic onshore and offshore wells and from foreign imports. The quantities of water and crude oil produced and consumed are unique to every formation and depend on the geology of the reservoir and the extraction technology used for recovery. Water is injected into wells for void replacement, pressurization, and reservoir stimulation. This water generally does not need to be of good quality and thus may have a minimal impact on local water resources. For example, offshore wells utilize seawater and many on-shore wells utilize local brackish water for recovery operations. The lower bound for freshwater resource consumption associated with petroleum recovery is zero. Offshore production composed slightly more than 17% of total US domestic production in 2013.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a></span>

        <p class="otherpara">Following recovery, crude oil is refined into a number of products including gasoline and diesel. Petroleum refineries use water for a number of different purposes including cooling and steam generation for distillation, cracking and reforming.

        <h3 id="sect319"><span class="b_heading">3.2 Biofuels</span></h3>
        <span>A number of different biomass sources can be converted into liquid transportation fuels such as ethanol, methanol, and biodiesel. The vast majority of bioenergy production in the United States, however, is derived from corn for ethanol production and soybeans for biodiesel production.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> The corn ethanol and soy biodiesel pathways consist of production of agricultural chemicals followed by farming to produce biomass and then conversion to fuel and other co-products in a biorefinery. The water consumption associated with corn ethanol or soy biodiesel depends heavily on the farming practices and regional climate where the feedstock is produced. Water consumption analysis of these biofuels therefore must consider spatial variability, temporal variability, and co-product allocation methodology.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Production of corn ethanol and soy biodiesel feedstock requires nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium phosphates derived from ammonia production through the Haber process. The production of ammonia relies heavily on natural gas and thus dominates the life cycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions for agricultural chemicals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> Phosphorous, potassium, and agricultural lime derived from mining operations are used to enhance production of both corn and soy biomass. Phosphate mining operations require water to generate slurries for transport and for beneficiating the mining products. Potassium is produced using solution mining, which requires substantial amounts of water. Limestone is extracted from quarries and then cut and ground into smaller pieces, which generates excess heat requiring cooling water. A number of other chemical processes are used to generate finished products for agriculture that consume small amounts of additional water for cooling.

        <p class="otherpara">Corn and soybean biomass are converted into biofuels in biorefineries across the United States. Corn grain can be converted into ethanol with either a wet- or dry-mill fermentation process that uses catalytic enzymes to increase yields and process efficiencies. Water is needed to create slurries and to dissipate waste heat generated in the reactors. Corn ethanol refineries generate useful co-products including electricity and distillers grains with solubles (DGS) that are used as animal feed. Soy biodiesel is produced by extracting soy oil from the beans and then converting the oil into biodiesel using the transesterification reaction. These processes co-produce soy meal (an animal feed) and glycerin, which is used for a number of industrial purposes including food and pharmaceutical product development.

        <span>CNG has been used as a transportation fuel in public transit buses in the United States for many years and is an increasingly attractive alternative transportation fuel for LDVs. CNG production from shale formations has recently become economical due to advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies, which dramatically increases available supplies. CNG can also be produced from biogenic sources, which provides a sustainable alternative to fossil-based carbon fuels. The CNG production pathway consists of recovery followed by processing, transportation, and compression. Petroleum, electricity, and gas are consumed throughout CNG production which increases the water consumption burden of the final product.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In 2013, the US produced over 840 billion m<small><sup>3</sup></small> of gas from sources including shale gas wells (39.6%), conventional gas wells (37.5%), oil wells (18.1%), and coalbed wells (4.8%).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> Conventional recovery operations require water for well drilling and cementing of wellbores. After construction of a well, no water is needed during operation. So while a large amount of water may be required initially during the well development, when amortized over the well life cycle the amount of water per unit gas produced may be relatively small.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Hydraulic fracturing increases the water intensity of shale gas relative to conventional gas production. Clark <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> analyzed water consumption associated with conventional gas production and compared it with shale gas production from the Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville, and Marcellus formations using data from each formation. Water for conventional drilling and cementing was estimated to range from 0.25–0.57 L per GJ of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). For hydraulic fracturing, Clark <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> computed the water consumed per unit natural gas produced based on EUR for each of the shale plays based on data from thousands of individual wells.

        <p class="otherpara">Following recovery, raw natural gas must be processed and purified before it can be transported to prevent corrosion and damage in pipelines and to minimize pollution associated with its consumption downstream. Raw gas contains a number of impurities including CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>S that can be preferentially absorbed in high pH aqueous solutions. Gas processing consumes energy and requires water for cooling. Gleick<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> indicated that 6.1 L of water per GJ are consumed in natural gas processing.

        <span>Electricity is generated from a number of different primary energy sources in the US grid including coal, natural gas, petroleum, nuclear power, hydropower, wind, geothermal power, biomass, and solar power. Shares for different power plants in the US mix used in GREET 2014 are shown in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>. The water consumption mechanisms associated with electric power generation include direct consumption as shown previously in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> and indirect consumption in fuel production cycles. Coal, petroleum, natural gas, and nuclear power plants each possess a fuel cycle that consumes water. Thermoelectric power plants including coal, nuclear, oil, natural gas, geothermal, biomass, and concentrated solar power plants consume water primarily for cooling waste heat from energy conversion processes. The amount of cooling water consumed depends on the plant's energy efficiency and cooling technology. Technologies used for process cooling include wet once-through cooling, recirculating cooling with either a cooling tower or a pond, and dry cooling. Wind, solar photovoltaic, and hydropower plants do not require cooling water. Hydropower plants, however, rely on reservoir storage where water is consumed by evaporation as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>.</span>

        <span>Petroleum refineries utilize a combination of fuels, electricity and hydrogen for processing crude oil into finished products. Each of these process inputs carries embedded water consumption, which contributes to the water consumption associated with the finished products. The contribution of the recovery operations, refinery processes, and these other process inputs were analyzed as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>. The electricity used in both recovery operations and in the refinery constitute 19.9% and 17.6% of the gasoline and diesel life cycle, respectively; processing and transportation fuel consumption represent 10.9% and 6.4% of the gasoline and diesel life cycle water consumption. Previous water consumption analyses of transportation fuels<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7,8</span></sup></a> have ignored water embedded in these intermediate resources. Gasoline has more impact than diesel due to the use of more intermediate resources (and associated embodied water) in processing despite having higher process water consumption requirements.

        <span>The water consumption life cycle for biofuels is dominated by irrigation water consumed in the feedstock production.

The Ohio climate (with an average annual precipitation from 1900 to 2001 of 38.22<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a>) was assumed to be representative of a baseline case for rain-fed corn and soybean production.

In the case of corn, the precipitation and associated water consumption factor explained the majority of the variability in the data (<span class="italic">r</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.62). However, for soybeans the precipitation deficit was weakly correlated with the water consumption (<span class="italic">r</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.14).

As shown previously in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>, the irrigation WCF for corn farming was greatest in 2002 and least in 2007. Among the combinations of irrigation WCFs and allocation methodologies, the 2007 irrigation WCF with a mass-based allocation to the DGS minimizes the life cycle water consumption in the ethanol, while the 2002 irrigation WCF with a market-based allocation to the DGS maximizes the life cycle water consumption in the ethanol as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>. These two extremes represent a range of 1739 to 3935 L per GJ for the water consumption intensity of corn ethanol in the United States. Improved technologies could decrease the water intensity in the future, although increased corn farming in arid regions and climate change could also increase the water intensity.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">As in the case of corn ethanol, the data from each of the four censuses and a number of different allocation methodologies could be used to estimate the life cycle water consumption for soy biodiesel. The contributions of the individual processes in the soy biodiesel production pathway were analyzed without any allocation using the average of the four censuses as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>. Irrigation accounted for over 97% of the life cycle water consumption while the biodiesel conversion process, agricultural chemicals, and other intermediate products representing 1.3%, 0.4%, and 1.2% of the total. Soybean farming uses no limestone and less nitrogen than corn farming but requires more irrigation water per unit production on average. For these reasons, irrigation is a much larger fraction of the life cycle water consumption of soy biodiesel relative to corn ethanol.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The default allocation methodologies in GREET 2014 for soymeal and glycerin are the mass basis and market basis, respectively, based on a previous study.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The average irrigation WCF from the four censuses and the default methodologies were used to allocate the water consumption burden to the soymeal and glycerin as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>.

The market basis provides the least allocation to the soymeal (6.2%), while the energy basis provides the least allocation to the glycerin (0.8%). The irrigation WCF associated with soybean farming has increased each year from 1997 to 2012 as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>. Thus the minimum life cycle water consumption estimate is derived from the 1997 irrigation WCF with a mass basis for soymeal and glycerin, while the minimum life cycle water consumption is derived from the 2012 irrigation WCF with the market based allocation for soymeal and an energy-based allocation for glycerin.

The estimate used in this analysis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> is based on total evaporation from hydropower-producing reservoirs divided by total power generation. This approach suffers two primary limitations: failure to account for natural water consumption from background evapotranspiration on land surface that would occur regardless of the presence of the dam and a failure to allocate water consumption amongst different purposes including navigation, municipal and agricultural use storage, fishing, and recreation. Because of the significance of electricity on other pathways and the larger implications of the tradeoff of water for electricity, the relationship between water consumption and hydroelectric power generation should be investigated in more detail in the future.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The thermoelectric facilities (coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, and municipal waste) consume similar quantities of water across their life cycles.

However, the water used in the fossil and nuclear fuel cycles is a significant portion of the life cycle water consumption (coal: 7.8%, natural gas: 13.1%, nuclear: 16.1%, petroleum: 64.8%, biomass: 3.6%).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The majority of the variability in each of the thermoelectric facilities is associated with the cooling technology. Once-through cooling systems withdraw large quantities of water but return the water to the resource where it was withdrawn at a higher temperature. The water consumption associated with once-through cooling systems is intended to represent the increased evaporation from increased temperature downstream of the facility. The source of these estimates in the literature is not entirely clear, however, and warrants further investigation. Once-through cooling is the most economical option, although it presents the greatest impact on local ecology and is increasingly not permitted.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> In recirculating cooling systems, the waste heat from power generation is dissipated to the atmosphere in a cooling tower or using an artificial pond thereby consuming more water than once-through systems.

Further characterization of coal mining water consumption is warranted. As discussed previously, the petroleum fuel cycle consumes large quantities of water during the recovery stage. A relatively large share of oil-based power generation comes from internal combustion engines and turbines (23%) that do not consume water. However, these processes are less thermodynamically and economically efficient. A large share of natural gas-based generation is derived from combined cycle plants that are more energy efficient and as a result tend to consume less water.</p>

Assuming that dry cooling could economically be used in place of cooling towers in the fuel conversion processes, there is potential to decrease the water consumption impacts of SMR, coal and biomass gasification by approximately 30%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. Water consumption associated with the fuel cycle was relatively insignificant for the SMR and gasification pathways. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10</a>, the life cycle water consumption requirements associated with gasification pathways (coal, switchgrass, willow, and forest residue) were not substantially different.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Distributed generation systems are expected to be less water and energy efficient due to scaling and thus would consume more water. The results of this analysis indicate that a distributed SMR would increase the life cycle water consumption requirements by 40% from 39.6 L per kg H<small><sub>2</sub></small> to 53.9 L per kg H<small><sub>2</sub></small>. However, distributed systems offer hidden advantages in transportation and delivery that were not included in this analysis.</p>

        <span>The fuel production pathways described in the previous sections were compiled into functional units of L of water per GJ to compare the impacts of their life cycle on water consumption on a consistent basis as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11</a>. The fossil fuel pathways generally have the least impact on water resources. Petroleum-based gasoline and diesel consume slightly more water than CNG because of the water consumption associated with enhanced recovery technologies. Despite public concern over the large amount of water associated with shale gas recovery, this analysis shows that the impact on a per unit energy basis is relatively small.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">The corn and soy biofuel production exhibit the largest water consumption impact amongst the fuels with the exception of electricity from hydropower. The water consumption associated with irrigation for a particular crop may be much less than or much greater than the US average presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11</a>. The RFS biofuel regulations are based on pathways that do not account for regional differences in resource consumption. These differences may have a large impact on water consumption; <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, corn from California requires far more irrigation than corn grown in the Eastern US. Given the relationships between energy and water (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, energy is used to produce water and water to produce energy), the importance of water consumption associated with bioenergy production in arid regions brings up larger questions of economic sustainability that are in need of deeper investigation. Additionally, the energy costs associated with these irrigation practices may have an impact on emissions life cycles.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The electricity generation pathways have both the smallest (wind) and largest (hydropower) impact on water resources consumption. The thermoelectric power generation pathways consume more than twice the water of fossil fuel pathways primarily for waste heat dissipation. Dry cooling technologies can be employed in power generation that would bring electricity water consumption estimates into a similar range as the baseline fossil fuels, although these technologies carry both a capital and energy penalty. As shown previously in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9</a>, over 70% of this water is associated with evaporation from hydropower reservoirs. Because electricity is a fundamental input for essentially all the other pathways, it is obvious that a detailed analysis of the water consumption associated with hydropower is in need of further characterization.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The pathways for centralized production of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> fuel showed similar water consumption footprints to the thermoelectric pathways on an energy basis. A large portion of the total is associated with water embedded in electric compression than can be traced to hydropower generation. Processing and cooling constitute the other major contributors to the H<small><sub>2</sub></small> pathways, so it is not surprising that their water consumption costs are similar to alternative electric power generation pathways.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The allocation methodology strongly influences the results for both corn ethanol and soy biodiesel. The market basis allocates the most water consumption to the fuels, while the mass basis allocates the least. A dry year with a market-based allocation can more than double the water consumption of the average year with other allocation methods. Allocation of the water consumption associated with hydropower reservoirs would also significantly influence the electricity pathway.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The fuel economies summarized in the ESI<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> were used to extend the water consumption to units of L per 100 km for light-duty vehicles as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12</a>. The range is intended to represent technological and methodological (allocation) differences rather than the variability in a particular fuel to provide the feasible near-term changes for each technology. Over half of the water embedded in the baseline fuel (E10) is associated with the ethanol even though it is only 10% of the fuel volume. Soy biodiesel consumes over 15 times as much water on a per km basis as petroleum diesel. In B20 diesel over 90% of the water consumption is associated with soybean irrigation. The CNGV exhibits the lowest burden on water consumption amongst the fuel pathways. The majority of the water is associated with electric compression of the fuel and not with the recovery process. Reforming the natural gas to H<small><sub>2</sub></small> for use in a FCEV more than doubles the water consumption intensity of transportation. Coal or biomass-based gasification in central facilities is expected to consume a similar amount of water as the SMR-based H<small><sub>2</sub></small> pathway. Electricity-based transportation exhibits high variability depending on the regional electricity mix. The fuel cycle has a relatively minor impact on the water consumption associated with electricity relative to power generation. The BEV is estimated to consume almost twice the water as the E10 baseline on average in the US. The larger implications of these estimates are unclear, however, since they are derived heavily from region-specific hydropower and irrigation estimates. In the TRE mix where there is very limited hydropower generation, the water consumption associated with 100 km of transportation is only 24.7 L which is similar to petroleum gasoline and diesel. A distributed electrolysis-based H<small><sub>2</sub></small> infrastructure for FCEVs has more than twice the water intensity per km as a distributed electricity-based infrastructure associated with BEVs. The difference is largely attributable to the energy inefficiency of the electrolysis process and the gas compression.</p>

      <h2 id="sect648"><span class="a_heading">5 Conclusions</span></h2>
      <span>Large-scale shifts in transportation technologies to alternative fuels will have a significant impact on water resources. This study has highlighted the importance of the life cycle approach to water consumption analysis by analyzing the impacts of the full supply chain for various alternative fuels and vehicles on water resources. This analysis provides a baseline for future studies of regional water consumption, alternative vehicle market penetration, and allocation methodologies that will be needed to understand the implications of changes to the transportation infrastructure on water resources or assessment of other emerging energy production technologies such as alternative biofuels. Indirect water consumption associated with transportation and intermediate energy consumption is an important part of the life cycle for petroleum and natural gas fuels. Moves towards alternative fuels appear to have a greater impact on water resources than fossil fuels. Energy and environmental policy should consider the implications of alternative vehicles on water resources when planning changes to the transportation and energy infrastructure. The values outlined in this study should not be interpreted as absolute inputs for specific projects since many processes (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, agriculture, mining) exhibit high degrees of spatial and temporal variability. Actual projects must therefore be evaluated on their specifics and not on national or regional averages.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">This study revealed a few areas in need of further research in the future. A comprehensive analysis of the regional variability and co-product allocation associated with hydropower generation is needed. A comparative analysis should be performed of the value of the electricity produced by reservoirs used primarily for hydropower <span class="italic">versus</span> the excess water consumed. Construction of excess water storage in large river networks may inefficiently allocate water for hydropower that could be used for other purposes downstream. The biomass feedstock for individual biorefineries may be produced locally or come from distant locations by rail. These differences will change the life cycle environmental impacts (both water and energy) of the fuel. The water consumption associated with secondary and tertiary petroleum recovery operations is based on a limited number of estimates of water injection rates and is in need of further characterization. Inconsistencies in state-level reporting requirements of injection into wells used for petroleum recovery complicate the analysis of petroleum water intensity.</p>
