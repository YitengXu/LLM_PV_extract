The International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) have evaluated speciation and provided a definition as follows: “speciation analysis is the analytical activity of identifying and/or measuring the quantities of one or more individual chemical species in a sample; the chemical species are specific forms of an element defined as to isotopic composition, electronic or oxidation state, and/or complex or molecular structure; the speciation of an element is the distribution of an element amongst defined chemical species in a system”. This review therefore deals with all aspects of the analytical speciation methods developed for: the determination of oxidation states; organometallic compounds; coordination compounds; metal and heteroatom-containing biomolecules, including metalloproteins, proteins, peptides and amino acids; and the use of metal-tagging to facilitate detection <span class="italic">via</span> atomic spectrometry. As with all ASU reviews<small><sup>1–5</sup></small> the coverage of the topic is confined to those methods that incorporate atomic spectrometry as the measurement technique. However, in the spirit of meeting the needs of the subject, material is incorporated that is not strictly “atomic spectrometry”. For the most part, such procedures are those in which some form of molecular MS is used for speciation measurements, often in parallel with an elemental detector. As the content of this Update shows, the field is now maturing as evidenced by the extent to which the speciation of particular elements or technique combinations have been the subject of review articles. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ascertain the analytical details of the methodologies applied in speciation analysis, particularly where the paper is published in an ‘application’ based journal.</p></div><hr/><h2 id="sect393"><span class="a_heading">1 Topical reviews</span></h2><span>In this review period <span class="italic">several texts containing chapters of interest</span> have appeared. Many of the volumes in the ten-volume set of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Mass Spectrometry</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> are now available, including volume 5 devoted to Elemental and Isotope Ratio MS. This volume contains eight chapters, the first of which covers the topic of the application of ICP-MS to elemental speciation analysis. Volume 8, entitled Hyphenated Methods, appears to be focused entirely on the determination of molecular species predominantly by GC-MS and LC-MS. The topic of isotopic determinations is the subject of two books. In <span class="italic">Isotopic Analysis: Fundamentals and Applications by ICP-MS</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> there is a chapter devoted to the determination of trace elements and elemental species using isotope dilution ICP-MS. A text covering <span class="italic">Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> has recently been published. The first part of this tome covers the theory and fundamentals of IDMS whilst the second part covers specific applications including the emerging field of quantitative proteomics. A new book, <span class="italic">Mercury in the Environment: Pattern and Process</span>, integrates the various sciences involved in the study of mercury cycling in the environment from the atmosphere, through terrestrial and aquatic food webs and human populations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> The book contains a chapter concerned with chemical analysis of waters, sediments and biota for Hg and its species. A second chapter which may be of interest covers the use of stable isotopes in mercury research. The second edition of <span class="italic">Methods of Analysis of Food Components and Additives</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> contains a chapter devoted to trace element determination and speciation that is 35 pages long and cites 371 references. A book entitled <span class="italic">Arsenic &amp; Rice</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> although written for an agronomist readership, does contain an account of the chemical measurements that underpin studies in this area. Topics covered include the measurement of total As and As species in rice and rice products. The techniques covered include HPLC coupled with ICP-MS and AFS.</span><p class="otherpara">There has been a considerable increase in the numbers of <span class="italic">review articles covering aspects of sample preparation</span>, and a decrease in the numbers of original research articles published, compared with last year's review. Liquid–liquid microextraction was the subject of two reviews. The speciation of some selenium compounds is mentioned in connection with applications of liquid phase microextraction applications in food analysis;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> however, as no titles of the 146 cited articles are provided, it is difficult to assess the extent of the coverage. In discussing the application of liquid-phase microextraction to the analysis of environmental and biological materials,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> Han and Row cite 7 articles concerning elemental speciation analysis out of the total of 166 citations.</p><p class="otherpara">A number of writers have scrutinised <span class="italic">solid-phase extraction</span>. In a review specifically devoted to SPE for elemental speciation in environmental samples, with special reference to aqueous solution, Das <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> presented quite detailed summaries of about 50 articles covering mostly the speciation of As, Cr, Hg, and V. Latorre <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> reviewed the use of carbon nanotubes as solid-phase extraction sorbents prior to atomic spectrometric determination of metal species. Applications to speciation studies, mostly of the elements mentioned above, are included in the 140 articles summarised. Herrera-Herrera <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> undertook a broader assessment of the use of carbon nanotubes in a 241-reference review of applications in separation science over a three-year period from 2009 to 2011. The topics described include the use of carbon nanotubes as solid-phase extraction and microextraction sorbents, as parts of membranes and in chromatography and electrophoresis. A table of applications to the SPE of inorganic analytes that covers about 40 articles is presented. The redox speciation of chromium using sorption-based systems is the subject of two review articles.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17,18</span></sup></a> The former review focused only on SPE procedures for Cr, whilst the latter considers SPE as part of a broader range of non-chromatographic separation techniques for Cr speciation, which includes co-precipitation, dialysis and LLE. Even though the sample type is “restricted” to natural waters, 87 articles are cited in this review.</p><p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">applications of UAE</span> have been reviewed<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> with particular emphasis on its “green” characteristics: amount and nature of solvents used, safety of operation, energy involved, time required, and waste production. The review includes a short section on speciation analysis. The replacement of the lengthy procedures of the original Westöö method for the dissolution of MeHg, (involving use of concentrated HCl, benzene and multiple extractions) by MAE or UAE with no organic solvents is cited as an example of the progress towards greener analytical methods.</p><p class="otherpara">Some <span class="italic">separation techniques for elemental speciation</span> have been reviewed with an emphasis on electrically driven separations. The only chromatographic technique to be reviewed is HILIC<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> with particular reference to applications in environmental analysis. Although metal complexes are highlighted in the introduction to the review, the applications described are limited to two articles concerned with the determination of Gd species and one article describing the determination of OTC, by ES ionisation MS. The reviewers point out that the number of publications describing methods involving HILIC is increasing and that preliminary clean-up with SPE is often a feature of the methods. A useful compilation of other reviews of HILIC is included among the 45 articles featured. Haider <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> point out that the on-line coupling of GE with ICP-MS, which dates from 2005, is a powerful tool for the separation, detection and quantification of bio-molecules that has been applied to the determination of phosphorus in DNA, phosphoproteins, and phosphopeptides. The determination of Au in nano-particles, Fe in metalloproteins, I in aerosols, and applications to the study of cisplatin–oligonucleotide interactions are also highlighted. It was speculated that the reason that relatively few papers have been published reflects the lack of familiarity with the benefits of what is considered a “promising” methodology. Comparisons were made with the alternative techniques of (a) SEC with ICP-MS detection, and (b) the coupling of flatbed GE with ICP-MS by LA. Compared with SEC, the advantages accrue from (a) the much lower concentrations of salts in the running/elution buffers, (b) the higher flow rates and (c) the lower costs of the separation media. In contrast to the LA interface, there is no loss of analyte as the separation is directly coupled to the ICP detector, and it is not necessary to stain the separated components to locate them on the gel. The status of PAGE and LA-ICP-MS within the general area of metallomics has been examined in some considerable detail.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> The reviewers identify seven limitations of the methodology and list at least one strategy for overcoming each of them, together with an appropriate citation or two. The main limitations addressed are the integrity of the protein–metal bond, contamination, and the difficulty of quantification.</p><p class="otherpara">Two reviews of <span class="italic">separations by CE</span> have appeared. Even though the separation of metallothioniens by CE might seem to be a rather limited topic, 186 articles of relevance were identified,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> several of which describe methods in which the separated components were detected by ICP-MS. In a survey of the CE of inorganic species as described in the 2009–2010 literature,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> the reviewers cover the topics described in 198 publications. During this two-year period, many tens of relevant review articles were identified, including two featuring ICP-MS. Elemental speciation is featured prominently in the review, as are applications to the separation of conjugates between metal NPs and biomolecules. Microchip electrophoresis was identified as an area that is growing in popularity. Miniaturisation is also the theme of a 53-reference review of “lab-on-valve” systems of sample handling for metal determinations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> However, all the speciation applications described are based on solid-phase extraction rather than chromatographic or electrophoretic separations. The majority of methods feature detection by atomic spectrometry rather than by electrochemistry or molecular spectrometry.</p><p class="otherpara">Several reviews of the benefits of <span class="italic">ICP-MS for element-specific detection</span> covered a range of different areas of application. Donard and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> reviewed 70 articles concerned with the determination of species-specific stable isotopes separated by chromatography, either HPLC or GC, and detected by MC-ICP-MS. The important experimental parameters and data reduction strategies that affect accuracy and precision are discussed. All the applications are critically evaluated in terms of analytical characteristics, advantages, disadvantages and potential for future applications to environmental, geochemical, and bioinorganic studies. Profrock and Prange<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> have reviewed the challenges, solutions, and trends in the applications of ICP-MS for quantitative analysis in environmental and life sciences. The focus of the review is on both recent developments and capabilities of ICP-MS coupled with different separation techniques, including HPLC, CE, GE and GC. A significant amount of the first part of the review, which covers methodology, is devoted to IDA. The second part of the review covers applications, in which about one-third of the total of 202 references are cited. The reviewers, unfortunately, state uncritically that the ICP-MS has compound-independent responses, which is not true, particularly when used as a detector following LC separations. The titles of the journal articles cited are given, which makes the reference list particularly informative. A review of developments and applications in hyphenated techniques as tools for speciation analysis of metal-based pharmaceuticals that features ICP-MS quite prominently has also been published.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> Methods in which ES-MS is used are also described. The review covers the contents of 179 articles in which separation by one of the major separation techniques, HPLC, GC or CE is described. The reviewers also state uncritically that ICP-MS demonstrates species-independent sensitivity. A review covering ICP-MS in drug development: bioanalytical aspects and applications, cites 166 references. The analytical potential, the quantitative bioanalytical aspects, the various modes of operation and the challenges of the application of ICP-MS to the life sciences were described in detail.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> The reviewers also consider the future potential of the technique in regulated bioanalysis and drug development.</p><p class="otherpara">A two part review, 201 references in total, of <span class="italic">HG analytical atomic spectrometry has been authored by</span> Long and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30,31</span></sup></a> The first part of the review covered the basic concepts, both BH-based and non-BH-based, of the HG technique. The second part was concerned with the elemental and speciation analysis of hydride-forming and non-hydride-forming elements in real samples but the coverage is dominated by lengthy tables that summarise the application by analyte and sample type.</p><p class="otherpara">Several reviews of <span class="italic">elemental speciation of particular sample materials</span> have appeared. Most of which are concerned with food and beverages. Welna <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> reviewed the speciation (and fractionation) of elements in tea infusions as described in 60 articles. The reviewers write, “unfortunately, the speciation and fractionation analysis of elements in tea is uncommon” and indicate that the most of the work relates to Al, and that as far as other elements are concerned, “unfortunately outcomes on this matter are scarce and inconclusive”. This seems a fair assessment of the status of elemental speciation in tea extracts. In a much broader review of trace element speciation in food,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> the elements were divided into ‘toxic’ and ‘essential’ categories based on an assessment of 68 cited articles. The coverage of each element (apart from Se) was rather brief; for example, there are fewer than 10 references to As speciation and the authors implied, incorrectly, that there is no speciated arsenic-in-rice CRM. Ruzik<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> reviewed what is referred to as the speciation of “challenging elements” in food by atomic spectrometry. The elements classified in this way (Co, Cu, Fe, I, Mn, Mo and Zn) are a subset of those considered to be “essential nutritive”. The others included in this larger group are Cr, F, Ni, Se, and Si. The review assesses the role of relevant compounds of each element in human nutrition and summarises the relevant literature on speciation (about 40 articles) in a table, from which it can be seen that the separation technique most often applied is SEC. A considerable portion of the review is devoted to sample preparation and a total of 135 articles are cited. It is also pointed out that many papers purportedly describing speciation in foodstuffs are actually describing fractionation methods. Recent developments in the speciation and location of As and Se in the challenging sample of solid rice grain have been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> More limited information was provided about the location of Ge, which was included because germanic acid is an arsenous/silicic acid analogue. It was proposed that the location of germanium may help elucidate the mechanisms of arsenite transport into grain. Most of the 63 articles included featured X-ray methods with some covering LA-ICP-MS. It was pointed out that the lower cost and greater accessibility of LA-ICP-MS compared with synchrotron techniques mean that the former is likely to be increasingly used in spatial studies of cereal grains. However, the fast, three-dimensional XRF microtomography that will be possible with advances in synchrotron detectors opens up the possibility of studies of fresh rice tissues at the cellular scale in the very near future. The writers also state, erroneously, that there is no speciated arsenic-in-rice CRM. The elemental speciation analysis of ambient aerosol particles by on-line MS has also been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> The elements of interest were Cr, I, N and S. The field is clearly in its infancy (only 31 references are cited) and extremely challenging given the very limited amount of sample available. It is likely that progress in this area will be slow, even allowing for the sensitivity of MS detection using laser desorption or thermal ionisation sampling capabilities. Reviews of methods for determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in environmental samples<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> and of the applications of X-ray spectrometry to the determination of the chemical environment of elements in cultural heritage items<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> may also be of interest. In the former review, the emphasis is on sample preparation and, in particular the application of extraction techniques such as SPME, single-drop micro-extraction, dispersive liquid–liquid micro-extraction, MAE, cloud point extraction, and hollow-fibre, liquid-phase, micro-extraction. In the latter review, which is written in French, the writers highlight the potential of XAS to provide insights into chemical reactions that occurred during the object's fabrication, and about the mechanisms of any subsequent alteration of an artwork.</p><h2 id="sect456"><span class="a_heading">2 Sample preparation</span></h2><span>Other than as described in the review articles discussed above in Section 1, there has been relatively little research activity concerned with sample preparation for elemental speciation, beyond the development of SPE procedures.</span><h3 id="sect460"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Analyte stability</span></h3><span>Olivares <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> described a method for the <span class="italic">speciation of Sb compounds in vegetables</span>.

It also prevented the oxidation of Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> to Sb<small><sup>V</sup></small> and stabilised other Sb species, such as TMSb<small><sup>V</sup></small>. The total Sb extraction efficiency from spinach was only 50% and from carrots and onion was 50 to 60% and 54 to 70%, respectively. Only Sb<small><sup>V</sup></small> was detected in three roots (onion and spinach) that represented 60–70% of the total antimony in the extracts.</span><p class="otherpara">In a study of the <span class="italic">speciation of As, Cr, and Se in ash and soil leachates</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> analyte stability was evaluated by spiking. A variety of environmental and geological samples, including waters, deionised water leachates, and simulated biological leachates from soils and wildfire ashes, were analysed. It was found that refrigeration at 10 °C was better at preserving species than freezing, particularly when all species were present. None-the-less, the researchers recommend that sample solutions and extracts should be analysed as soon as possible to “eliminate species instability and interconversion effects”. Speciation analyses were conducted on deionised water leachates and simulated lung fluid leachates of ash and soils impacted by wildfires.</p><h3 id="sect474"><span class="b_heading">2.2 Extraction methods</span></h3><span>There would appear to be relatively few new studies of the extraction of elemental species from solid samples.

It was concluded that UAE (for 1 h) was superior to mechanical agitation, extracting 74% of the total Sb (312 ± 25 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). As the real samples were prepared by freeze drying, it is not clear whether the particle sizes are comparable.

This is considered to be a separate category from applications to study the complexation and (bio)transformation reactions of metal analytes, which is labelled as “non-analytical” CE.

Angeli <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69</span></sup></a> distinguished between iHg and organic Hg (MeHg and EtHg) by control of the tetrahydroborate concentration in a FI-AFS procedure. At very low values of the borohydride concentration (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 10<small><sup>−5</sup></small> M) and with the photoreactor turned off, only hydrides of the organic Hg compounds were produced, together with some mercury vapour. When the photoreactor (a microwave-powered mercury electrodeless discharge lamp) was turned on, all species were converted to Hg<small><sup>II</sup></small> so that total Hg could be determined. The LOD for the method was 45 nmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (as Hg), which converts to the rather unimpressive 9 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The researchers investigated a recent claim by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> that the addition of <span class="small_caps">L</span>-cysteine could weaken the Hg–C so that organo Hg compounds would react with BH without any prior digestion. However, this claim could not be corroborated, and the findings of Angeli <span class="italic">et al.</span> were described as being in “sharp contrast” to those of Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span> The method was validated by the determination of MeHg in TORT-1 (dogfish muscle) and applied to the analysis of 10 human saliva samples in which the total Hg concentrations of about 6 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were less than the 12 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the blank. Despite what is implied in the abstract of the article, MeHg was not found in any of the samples, though spikes ranging from 60 to 200 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were 85% recovered. Yin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit71"><sup><span class="sup_ref">71</span></sup></a> distinguished between the species by turning the flame in the AFS detector off, when only Hg vapour was measured. With the flame on, all volatile Hg species were detected including that produced from the reaction of MeHg with BH. The volatile species were generated a continuous flow manifold in which the acidified sample was merged with a stream of BH solution. There is no information about the flow rate of these two streams and the researchers did not, apparently, consider them to be parameters in the (single-cycle univariate) optimisation. The LODs were 0.03 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.05 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for iHg and MeHg, respectively. The method was validated by the analysis of a CRM, TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas) and applied to the determination of the species, spiked at 2 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, into three water samples. Zhang and Adeloju<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> exploited the effect of changing the BH concentration and the addition of a catalyst to the sample. After a thorough investigation of a large number of possible metal ion catalysts and the addition of thiourea to the BH reagent, conditions were found under which only iHg produced Hg vapour (0.0001% BH) and under which both iHg and MeHg gave the same sensitivity (0.1% BH with 100 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Fe<small><sup>3+</sup></small> added to the sample). The reactions were carried out in a merging zone FI manifold in which the sample was delivered at 9.6 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the reductant at 3.2 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. When iHg was determined, the carrier stream was air, but was switched to dilute hydrochloric acid for the determination of MeHg. The method was validated by the analysis of SRM DOLT-4 (fish liver). The article contains a lengthy discussion of the possible catalytic mechanism and results to show that the addition of thiourea to the acid for extraction of the Hg species from the fish tissue considerably improves the extraction of iHg. The LOD was 0.2 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> using AAS for both species. Naozuka, and Nomura<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> developed a Hg speciation method based on selective thermochemistry inside a graphite furnace atomiser. Total Hg could be determined with solid sampling (powder and slurries were transferred into the furnace) when both a permanent iridium modifier was combined with palladium and magnesium added along with the sample. Under these conditions all Hg species were stabilised and sample matrix could be removed in the pyrolysis step. If tubes without the permanent modifier were used, then iHg was lost at about 120 °C, but MeHg was stable up to 280 °C. In the presence of sample matrix, these temperatures were shifted to 200 °C and 480 °C, respectively. The method was validated by the accurate analysis of CRMs CE-464 (tuna fish), TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas), and DOLT-2 (dogfish), and applied to the analysis of a candidate tuna fish reference material.</span><h3 id="sect766"><span class="b_heading">3.3 Developments in instrumentation</span></h3><span>The <span class="italic">element speciation capabilities of current on-line aerosol MS</span> for both carbonaceous and non-carbon-containing aerosol species has been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> Essentially, there are two types of instrument: those with laser desorption/ionisation and those with thermal desorption electron impact ionisation. In the former, the particle sizing system triggers a high-energy laser pulse that instantly vaporises and ionises the particle in the ion source of the TOF mass spectrometer. Although this process is extremely efficient, enabling analysis of individual particles, it is susceptible to matrix effects that can significantly affect relative peak intensities within the mass spectrum. Therefore, typically “fingerprint” mass spectra are obtained that reflect the chemical type of the analysed aerosol. In the second type of spectrometer, multiple particles are flash-vaporised when hitting a hot (∼600 °C) surface, and the evolved vapour is ionised by electron impact. This two-step process provides quantitative information about non-refractory particle components. However, because there is no separation step only limited information on individual species can be obtained. The review examines progress in the speciation of Cr, I, N and S and variety of C-containing particles. For N, S and C, it appears that considerable species information can be obtained; for example, nitrate, ammonium, amine and amino acid N can be distinguished. On the other hand, the information that can be obtained for Cr and I would appear to be much more limited and more strongly dependent on instrument operating conditions. The reviewer suggests that the co-location of both types of instruments would be helpful, so that the results of single particle analyses by laser desorption ionisation could be evaluated alongside the results obtained by the thermal desorption process (see also Section 1).</span><p class="otherpara">The group of Sanz-Medel<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> describe <span class="italic">an ICP-MS instrument containing a triple quadrupole mass analyser</span> as a new tool for absolute quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics. These areas of study need interference-free quantification at very low concentrations of ICP-detectable elements naturally present in proteins. The triple quad spectrometer allows a new way of removing polyatomic interferences in the determination of S (present in the majority of proteins as methionine or cysteine) and of P (present in phosphorylated proteins), based on the tandem mass spectrometry typically used in molecular MS. The first quadrupole was operated as band-pass mass filter (window 1 amu) to select target analyte ions (<small><sup>31</sup></small>P, <small><sup>32</sup></small>S and their isobaric polyatomic interfering species). In the second quadrupole, only the ions selected react with oxygen, thereby decreasing both the interferences produced by matrix ions and the background noise.

Compared with the performance of a single quadrupole instrument with a dynamic reaction/collision cell, enhanced sensitivity and selectivity were obtained. The separation of S- and P-containing species by capillary HPLC followed by detection with the triple quad instrument was described. Limits of detection of 11 and 6.6 fmol, respectively, were obtained which, it was claimed, are the lowest ever published.</p><h3 id="sect783"><span class="b_heading">3.4 X-ray methods</span></h3><span>Reports of elemental speciation in biological materials by X-ray methods remain relatively scarce.

The main Fe pigments responsible for the dark-red coloration of Attic pottery fragments from the Gioiosa Guardia archaeological site in Sicily that date back to the VI–V centuries BC have been characterised. Absorption spectra were collected at the Fe K-edge on the Italian beamline for absorption and diffraction (BM8-GILDA) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> Analysis by both XANES and EXAFS showed that samples were a mixture of Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> (hematite or maghemite) and magnetite (Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>), occurring in variety of relative abundances. Other researchers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> at the Grenoble facility (on beam line BM-29), examined Co speciation in blue-and-white glazes from 16<small><sup>th</sup></small> to 17<small><sup>th</sup></small> century Chinese porcelains excavated in the Old-City part of Lisbon. Both the surface of the glazed debris and pressed pellets of slightly ground model compounds mixed with boron nitride were irradiated. Energy calibration was achieved by irradiating a cobalt metal foil and assigning the first inflection point to 7709 eV. The model compounds used were Co<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>, CoAl<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> and Co<small><sub>2</sub></small>SiO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, plus a cobalt-based blue pigment (cerulean). The results confirmed a coordination environment of the pigmenting Co<small><sup>2+</sup></small> ions close to tetrahedral and it was concluded that Co plays the dual roles of network former and modifier in these glazes. A third research group, working on beam lines ID21 and ID19, examined Mn speciation in 14<small><sup>th</sup></small> century stained glass windows originating from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> in a study of the role of reducing reagents in the restoration of glass that is suffering from Mn-browning. Photoreduction observed with the focused (sub-μm) beam was avoided by defocusing the beam to about 10 μm in diameter. The XANES results clearly showed that treatment with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, which eliminates the dark coloration and restores the clear appearance of the glass, results in the reduction of Mn<small><sup>IV</sup></small> to Mn<small><sup>II</sup></small>. It was possible to map the distribution of species in the glass by μ-XRF by controlling the excitation energy. When the primary energy is 6.550 keV, Mn<small><sup>II</sup></small> is excited and Mn<small><sup>IV</sup></small> is somewhat excited, at higher energy (6.558 keV), Mn<small><sup>IV</sup></small> is more efficiently excited, while at 6.587 keV, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, well above the Mn–K edge, all species of Mn are excited with equal probability. By defining the sensitivity factors as the XANES intensity readings of the respective Mn-reference compounds, the fluorescent radiation intensity could be deconvoluted into the contributions from each species. Studies by high resolution computed tomography showed (a) the progress of the cleaning process, (b) that Mn was leached into the reducing solution, and (c) that the glass was, in fact, being damaged by the process.</p><p class="otherpara">Three <span class="italic">investigations of relevance to the nuclear industry using X-ray techniques</span> have been described. Measurements at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) in Villigen on both the μ-XAS beamline and the LUCIA beamline (for the Mg–K and Na–K μ-XRF maps) were used to study Ce speciation after long-term aqueous alteration (12 years at 90 °C and pH 9.6) of simulated nuclear waste glass.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77</span></sup></a> The μ-XRF maps and μ-XANES spectra revealed that Ce was predominantly Ce<small><sup>IV</sup></small> in the original glass, but that following dissolution from the glass matrix, was partly reduced and re-immobilised as Ce<small><sup>III</sup></small> at grain boundaries or in the interstitial spaces between the glass particles. The concentration of Ce<small><sup>III</sup></small> correlated with the spatial distribution of secondary Mg-clay formed as the main glass alteration product during the corrosion. It was argued that because redox-sensitive elements in the pristine glass (such as chromium, iron, and selenium) occur almost exclusively as oxidised species, reduction of Ce<small><sup>IV</sup></small> was probably mediated by an external reductant, such as iron from the steel reaction vessel. The results showed that the glass was leached at relatively low oxidation potentials (<span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>h</sub></small> &lt; 0.2 V) but a detailed examination of the equivalent <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>h</sub></small>–pH diagram for plutonium revealed that under comparable conditions the reduction of Pu<small><sup>IV</sup></small> to Pu<small><sup>III</sup></small> would require considerably more reducing conditions (<span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>h</sub></small> &lt; −0.3 V). It was concluded that Ce is not a good chemical analogue for plutonium, despite its wide use as a surrogate in simulated radioactive waste. Other workers studied Pu–U mixed oxide nuclear reactor fuels on the μ-XAS beam line (X05LA) at the same facility.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> The size of the X-ray spot was about 2 μm and the energy calibration for both Pu and U was done in transmission mode using a thin UO<small><sub>2</sub></small> powder sample consisting of micro-particles of UO<small><sub>2</sub></small> diluted in a 3 mm boron nitride pellet. The centre and periphery of both fresh and irradiated rods were examined by μ-XRF, μ-XRD, as well as μ-XAFS, and it was concluded that even in the irradiated fuel, the Pu<small><sup>IV</sup></small> is not oxidised to either Pu<small><sup>V</sup></small> or Pu<small><sup>VI</sup></small>. Frohlich <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> point out that for certain European countries, such as France, Germany, and Switzerland, clay is considered to be a possible host ‘rock’ formation for the storage of high-level nuclear waste and that, in addition to other transuranium elements, <small><sup>237</sup></small>Np (<span class="italic">t</span><small><sub>1/2</sub></small> 2.1 × 10<small><sup>6</sup></small> years) will contribute significantly to the radiotoxicity of this waste after storage times of more than a thousand years. It was argued that, over storage times of several hundred thousand years, escape of the radionuclides from their storage place is a possibility and interaction between these radioactive elements and the geological and technical barriers must be considered. Consequently, the uptake of Np species by Opalinus Clay (OPA) was studied using the facilities of both the Swiss Light Source and of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble. Thin sections of OPA in contact with Np<small><sup>V</sup></small> solution under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as a diffusion sample, were analysed by μ-XRF to determine the elemental distributions of Ca, Fe and Np. Regions of high Np concentration were subsequently investigated by μXAFS to determine the oxidation state of Np, and information about the reactive crystalline mineral phases in the vicinity of Np enrichments was obtained from μ-XRD. They found that Np<small><sup>V</sup></small> was reduced to Np<small><sup>IV</sup></small> mostly under anaerobic conditions. Spatially resolved measurements showed that Np<small><sup>IV</sup></small> tended to aggregate and that Np(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) was distributed more homogeneously on the OPA surface. It was concluded that in regard to the long-term storage of nuclear waste, these results support the suitability of this type of host rock because the highly mobile Np<small><sup>V</sup></small> will be immobilised by reduction to Np<small><sup>IV</sup></small> in the Opalinus Clay.</p><p class="otherpara">There have also been a number of <span class="italic">studies of particulate material</span>.

Measurements were made at beam line 01B1 of the SPring-8 synchrotron radiation facility in Hyogo, Japan (one of only 4 facilities in the world with beam energy greater than 5 GeV). For the EXAFS experiments, the researchers prepared standards by mixing appropriate reagents with boron nitride, forming pellets, and storing in sealed polyethylene bags. The 13 fly ash samples were prepared by sealing the powder directly into polyethylene bags. It was found difficult to quantitatively examine the chemical species with EXAFS only; however, fitting to the XANES spectra enabled direct quantification of the chemical species, showing that PbSiO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, PbCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>, or Pb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small> was the predominant species. Other elements were also determined by XRF spectrometry and ICP-OES and fractioned the lead (6 fractions) with a sequential extraction procedure.

Particles containing V were identified, at the microprobe beamline 10.3.2 (Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA), by XRF mapping using a focused beam (5 μm<small><sup>2</sup></small> spot on the sample). The XANES 1s spectra, collected over the energy range 5350–5720 eV, were compared with a spectral library of 19 vanadium-bearing materials.

Spectra were calibrated using the inflection point of elemental S at 2472 eV and of Fe foil at 7110.75 eV. Principal component analysis (PCA) and target transformation analysis were performed on an Fe XANES dataset (26 spectra; 7010–7410 eV range) to determine the number of species present and evaluate the suitability of standards, using SixPack software. Sulfur XANES data (2420–2575 eV range) were compared with reference spectra. The researchers found over 20 different minerals, nine of which were either not predicted by thermodynamic modelling or had no close match in their thermodynamic database. The S-bearing phases consisted of polysulfides (S-6, S-8), and metal sulfides (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn) and four dominant species, Fe oxyhydroxide, Fe monosulfide, pyrrhotite, and pyrite, accounted for over 80% of the Fe present.

The remaining uncertainty arose from the repeatability of five individual replicate samples and the measured isotope amount ratios. It was concluded that the found mass fractions of SeMet in the three serum standards analysed could be used as indicative values for method validation for the determination of SeMet in human serum. The second paper 33/1042 investigated the impact of pump flow fluctuations, for the added post-column spike, for SUIDMS.

It was found that the sorption processes (ion exchange, adsorption and chemisorptions) of As species on SBAE (ion exchange) and HY resins depended on the pH values of the water samples. This was exploited to determine the different species present. Both ICP-MS and HG-AAS were employed as detectors, ICP-MS offering a LOD of 0.2 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and RSD values between 3.5 and 5.1%.

Inorganic As<small><sup>III</sup></small> and As<small><sup>V</sup></small> were chosen as the targets to demonstrate the performance of the technique. Baseline separation of As<small><sup>III</sup></small> and As<small><sup>V</sup></small> was achieved within 70 s in a 26 mm long channel at 2.8 kV using a mixture of borate buffer and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (pH 9.5) as an electrolyte. The RSDs of peak height, based on six determinations of 50 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> standard of As<small><sup>III</sup></small> and As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, were 5% and 7%, respectively.

Elution of the analytes from the ferrihydrite binding layer was performed using 1 mL of 1 M NaOH to facilitate As speciation analysis using chromatographic separation. Average recovery rates were between 87 and 108%. This study shows that the contribution of DMA and MMA to the total accumulated mass must be taken into consideration when evaluating DGT data in future studies.

The iAs species, arsenate and arsenite were found in plants from all habitats and MMA in all but one plant species. Arsenate predominated in submerged plants. The results suggest that the habitat and the [As](soil) have a strong influence on the As accumulation in plants and that submerged plants and/or gymnosperms might be suitable for phytoremediation of As. An evaluation of As speciation and bioaccumulation in different plant species from two highly polluted mining areas in N.

Extraction efficiencies (using 0.3 M orthophosphoric acid) were above 80% and speciation was not altered, since recoveries of the spiked As species (As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, DMA and MMA) were between 94 and 102%. Speciation studies were performed using HPLC-ICP-MS and showed As<small><sup>V</sup></small> was always the predominant species, although significant levels of As<small><sup>III</sup></small> was found for all samples.

Various authors have reported on As speciation in seafood. A continuous leaching method coupled online with ICP-MS detection has been used to assess the maximum bioaccessibility of As in seafood samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a> The method simulated continuous-flow digestion by successively pumping artificial saliva, gastric and intestinal juices through a mini-column of powdered sample directly connected to the nebuliser of an ICP-MS instrument. The method allowed the real-time measurement of As being released by a given reagent. Because the analyte is continuously removed from the system, in contrast to batch methods, the dissolution equilibrium is driven to the right, hence quickly providing information about the worst-case scenario. Following consecutive leaching by the digestive reagents, the leachates were subject to speciation analysis by IC-ICP-MS to determine the As species released. Finally, the remaining residue from the mini-column was fully digested to verify mass balance. The method was used to determine the bioaccessibility of total As and As species in four CRM's and in several real seafood samples. The mass balance was verified in each case. Generally speaking, the non-toxic form was easily released whereas the inorganic forms were poorly bioaccessible. The separation of As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, MMA, DMA, AsB, arsenosugar PO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, arsenosugar OH, arsenosugar SO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and arsenosugar SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> were carried out to determine As speciation in sea fish and shellfish.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> A Hamilton PRP-X100 anion-exchange column with a mobile phase of 20 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>HCO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (pH 10.3) and a Dionex Ionpac CS-10 cation-exchange column with a mobile phase of 5 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> pyridinium (pH 2.0) was coupled to ICP-MS to achieve this. The results showed that main components in all of the extracted fish and shellfish samples were AsB (42.8% to 99.4%), while arsenosugar PO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and arsenosugar OH were detected in most extracted shellfish samples (32.5% to 57.1%, 1.4% to 3.3% respectively).

Inorganic As, that is, the sum of As<small><sup>III</sup></small> and As<small><sup>V</sup></small> and any thiol-bound As, was found to be less than 4% of the total As in 12 samples of fish meal when subjected to this extraction method followed by HPLC-ICP-MS. To date, there is no certified value of iAs in a seafood-based CRM to compare to in order to validate the findings. This illustrates the difficulties in quantitative determination of iAs in seafood and the need for a CRM for iAs and proficiency tests in order to introduce legislation for a maximum level of iAs in seafood and feed. The bioavailability of total As, As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, MMA, DMA, AB, and AC has been assessed in different raw seafood samples (white fish, cold water fish and molluscs) by using an <span class="italic">in vitro</span> model that combines simulated gastric and intestinal digestion/dialysis methods.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> Correlations between As species bioaccessibility and seafood nutrient contents (fat and protein) were also established.

The As species, after matrix solid phase dispersion, and the species in the dialysable fraction were determined by HPLC-ICP-MS. Accuracy was assessed by analysing DORM-2 and BCR-627 CRMs and a mass-balance study. High dialysability percentages for total As and for As species were found (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> from 84.6 ± 1.7% to 106 ± 2.6%), and the bioaccessibility of As exhibited a negative correlation with the fat content of the seafood.

However the main Au-containing peak comprised two of the adducts which co-eluted from the column. Unfortunately no further HPLC work was reported so it is unclear which of the two adducts was formed in solution or whether this occurred during the separation. The drug was also incubated with HSA again at pH 7.4 and studied by the complementary MS methods. However, the resolving power of the ES instrument was not able to fully separate the ions sufficiently for deconvolution of the pattern to produce a clear understanding of the drug–protein reaction. The authors did report a single Au containing adduct identified as the triethylphosphine gold moiety bound to a Cys-34 residue of mercaptoalbumin. Whilst the thiol ligand of Auranofin was displaced, the remaining triethylphosphine gold structure was covalently bound to either glutathione or HSA. Moreover, oxidation of the phosphine ligand by disulfides occurred in both reaction mixtures with producing phosphine oxide. Reactions of Auranofin with the thiols were quantitatively traced over several days by ICP-MS. Based on the data obtained, a potential reaction pathway of Auranofin with the two thiols was proposed.

The advantages of this seem minor compared to the costs involved, particularly as the same degree of chromatographic specificity would be required with or without this approach. It is also unclear why there would be any endogenous contribution to a drug of this type, but also loss of the enriched isotope during metabolism would effectively make the drug invisible to the ICP-MS detection system.

Four different extraction solutions, (5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl, 60 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCL in saturated NaCl, 3.0 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> KOH in MeOH and 25% TMAH in H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), were evaluated in this work. About 100 mg of TORT-2 CRM, lobster hepatopancreas, was suspended in 4 mL of extractant and the enriched Me<small><sup>201</sup></small>Hg and <small><sup>199</sup></small>Hg spikes added. The sample and spike were equilibrated by shaking for 15 minutes, followed by UAE for 30 minutes at a constant temperature of 50 °C. After the UAE procedure, samples were centrifuged and a 1 mL aliquot removed for Hg species derivatisation with 0.4 mL NaPr<small><sub>4</sub></small>B (2% in 0.2 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> NaOH), 4 mL 1.1 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> sodium acetate adjusted to pH 5 and 1 mL of hexane with gentle shaking for 10 minutes. The total Hg concentration in each extract was determined by a combustion, trap and purge direct mercury analyser using AA detection whilst the individual Hg species were quantified by GC-ICP-MS. For the total Hg measurements quantitative recovery was only achieved with 5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl (&gt;98%) or 25% TMAH in H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O (101%) with lower values obtained for 60 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCL in saturated NaCl (24%) and 3.0 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> KOH in MeOH (83%). However, recoveries of &gt;98% were obtained for iHg and MeHg with all extractant solutions for ss-IDA, again demonstrating that complete equilibration of the added spike with the sample, rather than complete analyte extraction, is necessary to achieve accurate results. No significant methylation of iHg was observed during these analyses but significant demethylation was observed for all extractants except for 5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl. It should be noted that the double spike procedure employed was able to correct for the observed demethylation of MeHg and thus provided accurate results. The time required for the UAE procedure with 5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl was also optimised and recoveries of &gt;98%, for both total Hg and ss-IDA, were obtained for three different extraction times of 5, 15 and 60 minutes. Finally, the optimised procedure, UAE for 5 minutes with 5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl at 50 °C, was applied to both fresh and dried swordfish and shark samples. The values reported for iHg, were &lt;0.02 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in both sample types. The results for MeHg were 0.69 and 1.7 mg Hg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for swordfish and shark, respectively. The sum content of the species found were in good agreement with the total Hg concentration determined by AAS. In addition, no differences in the measured total Hg, iHg and MeHg concentrations were observed between the fresh and dried samples for each fish species. However, demethylation of up to 5% of the total MeHg present was observed in these fish samples which was greater than that for the TORT-2 CRM which exhibited &lt;1% demethylation. This latter finding was attributed to the differences in sample preparation for the CRM and the real fish samples, with the former undergoing a procedure to remove natural oils present. This highlights the need for method optimisation on real samples and not just for a CRM. In summary, these two papers are recommended as reference works for the determination and validation of methodologies for Hg speciation in seafoods.</p><p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">photochemical alkylation of iHg</span> in the presence of ketones, aldehydes and low molecular weight organic acids as alkyl donors has also been investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit202"><sup><span class="sup_ref">202</span></sup></a> The photochemical experiments were conducted using 4.5 m of 0.8 mm i.d PTFE tubing wrapped around a low pressure Hg vapour UV lamp. The mixtures of iHg, 500 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and the alkyl donor, 1 mM, were pumped through the reactor at different flow rates to vary the irradiation time. The reactor effluent was directly analysed by HPLC-AFS and HPLC-ICP-MS and, after aqueous ethylation and/or phenylation, by SPME-GC-MS and purge and trap GC-ICP-MS. Further analyses using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry CE-UV and direct scanning UV were also used to identify the reaction radicals and products and to elucidate the photalkylation mechanism. Full details of all the analytical techniques used were given as ESI. When 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone and propionic acid were used as the alkyl donors, unidentified Hg compounds were observed in the HPLC-AFS/ICP-MS chromatograms. These compounds eluted before the MeHg peak and it was postulated that these species contained hydrophilic functional groups produced from the UV induced breakdown of the alkyl donor species. The degree of Hg<small><sup>II</sup></small> alkylation was found to follow the order: ketones &gt; aldehydes &gt; low-molecular-weight organic acids &gt; alcohols. The proposed alkylation mechanism is the formation of a UV energy absorbing Hg<small><sup>II</sup></small>/alkyl donor complex followed by an intercomplex transfer of an alkyl group resulting in the formation of alkylHg species. Due to other photochemical processes, dealklyation of MeHg and EtHg, reduction of Hg<small><sup>II</sup></small> and oxidation of Hg<small><sup>0</sup></small> was also observed.

The propylation procedure for Hg species and GC-ICP-MS separation was the same as that described above in <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit200">ref. 200</a>. Two CRMs were used to monitor the accuracy and precision of the method, BCR-579 coastal seawater, for total Hg in water samples, and IAEA 405 estuarine sediment for mercury speciation in the SPM and sediments. The results of the CRM analyses, for triplicate determinations in each case and given as the percent deviation from the certified value and an RSD% value respectively, were total Hg in BCR-579 2.1% and 0.8%, 3.5% and 5.4% for MeHg in IAEA 405, 3.4% and 3.8% for total Hg in IAEA 405 and 3.7% and 2.2% for TBT in PACS-2.

It was concluded that iHg was the major mercury species entering the Bach Dang estuary, being transported downstream bound to SPM and that iHg methylation increased as SPM residence time increased. When flux values were taken into account the estuary appeared to be an important source of iHg in the wet season and MeHg in the dry season to the surrounding coastal zone. An alternate approach to the determination of mercury species in seawaters has been described in which a sulfonic acid based cation exchange column was inserted in the sample loop of an HPLC-ICP-MS system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209</span></sup></a> Mercury species were extracted onto the column (50 mm × 4 mm i.d.) from 30 mL of filtered (0.2 μm) seawater flowing at 9 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

Quantification of Hg in the extracts was by ID-ICP-MS using a spike enriched in <small><sup>200</sup></small>Hg. Subsequently, SEC-ICP-MS studies revealed that the MeHg was only bound to a protein fraction with a molecular mass of &gt;70 kDa. An SDS-PAGE separation followed by excision and digestion of the protein spots with nitric acid was then performed. Analysis of these digests showed that the majority of the Hg present was in a fraction with a RMM of approximately 220 kDa. Finally, protein spots from a separate SDS-PAGE separation were enzymatically digested, with trypsin in a multistage procedure, followed by analysis with HPLC-ICP-MS, which identified at least five Hg containing peptides. Twenty eight peptides were identified in total by HPLC-ES-MS-MS and database searching suggested that the original protein to which the MeHg was bound belonged to the myosin family.

A fast method<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233</span></sup></a> has been developed for Se, Cu, Fe and Zn speciation in human serum. It was based on the use of monolithic anion exchange micro-columns (1 × 50 mm) coupled to ICP-MS. In contrast with traditional AEC, the new column required serum volumes as low as 1 mL and it provided six-fold faster separation (10 minutes) while maintaining chromatographic resolution. The method was applied to easily detect quantitative and qualitative differences between RMs (Seronorm L1 and Seronorm L2) and among serum, heparinised plasma and EDTA-treated plasma. Unlike Fe, Cu and Zn, Selenium chromatographic profiles were not affected by EDTA because this chelator is unable to break the Se–C bounds. A combination of species unspecific IDA affinity LC-ICP-MS, LA-ICP-MS, and ES-MS-MS was developed to identify and quantify SelP, GPX3 and SeAlb in a human plasma reference material SRM 1950.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> Only two selenium-containing proteins, albumin and SelP, were detected after applying a shot-gun proteomic approach to three selenium-containing fractions, corresponding to the non-retained fraction (F1), the heparin-Sepharose retained fraction (F2), and the blue-Sepharose retained fraction (F3). However SelP identification in F2 and F3 fractions was not conclusive. Unambiguous identification of SelP and GPX3 was achieved by applying LA-ICP-MS followed ES-MS-MS. For this purpose, proteins in affinity fractions were separated by GE, electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane, and Se was detected by LA-ICP-MS analyses.

The paper went on to review the main techniques that have been used and which offer the capability to overcome the highlighted problems. These include the broad areas of: 2D gel electrophoresis which separates first by charge (isoelectric focusing) and then by molecular mass; 2D or multidimensional LC using any of the conventional HPLC types such as IE, SEC or RP chromatography in series. The application of immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) which can be used to “fish out” proteins that contain metal-binding motifs was also covered. The caveat for IMAC is that some proteins may have the capacity to bind metals but never do so <span class="italic">in vivo</span> and some that avidly bind metals, but are not retained because the binding site is unavailable due to the presence of a strongly bound metal still being present. The different native and non-native forms of molecular mass spectrometry such as ES-MS-MS which is used in conjunction with the aforementioned chromatographic methods are described very nicely in this paper.

The gradient elution system used two identical columns that were switched back and forth between two flow paths, one for the separation and the second a regeneration eluent, which allowed for column washing and re-equilibrium in a timely manner. The mobile phase was also passed through a column containing a Chelex 100 chelating resin prior to use in an attempt to lower the trace element content. Two different calibration methods were described. The peak area normalisation method used the total concentration of the element of interest to determine the protein content by the proportion eluting as each peak. By contrast the normal calibration curve method used post-column infusion of standards and the element “mass-flow” to determine the concentration of the standards, in an analogous way to the species non-specific IDMS approach. This second method overcame the need for molecular standards, whereas the former required two measurement steps, with all the inherent disadvantages this produces. The chromatograms provided in the report identify peaks which are difficult to distinguish from the baseline signal. For Cu, Fe and Zn this is due to the retention of these elements on the column followed by slow release as the elution strength of the mobile phase increases with the gradient elution. For Se the effect seems to be due to the poor LOD for the isotope used. The clear retention of Cu, Fe and Zn on the column, followed by slow leaching off is clearly a major flaw with the column used, for which no explanation is given. Presumably these elements, which do not normally occur as ionic species in serum, have been stripped from the proteins under study making them available for acquisition by apo-proteins with vacant binding sites. Unfortunately no other chromatographic system was used to verify the reported results. The other problem with the method is that HSA, the major metal binding protein in serum, elutes as 2 peaks separated by more than 2 minutes. In all, it is unclear what the advantages of measuring the trace element binding proteins actually is compared to accurately measuring the total metal concentration. Possibly, this relates to different disease states but the authors provide no evidence of this in their report as they do not analyse samples which would reflect this. Also to be of use in a real clinical setting where hundreds of samples are measured for these elements in a single run, some indication of the robustness of the system over many more samples is required, particularly as there were problems of metal build-up and subsequent elution from the column, which were not resolved using the column clean-up wash. Measurement of the bioactive forms of vitamin B<small><sub>12</sub></small> in the human diet is extremely important from a nutritional perspective because it has a vital role in important homeostatic functions such as: the formation of red blood cells; DNA synthesis; and the central nervous system.

Szterk <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit248"><sup><span class="sup_ref">248</span></sup></a> have used a small bore (2 mm i.d.)

Cooking the meat reduced the amount of cobalamin that was measured in the samples. However, it was not clear whether this was due to the breakdown of the analyte, as proposed by the authors or due to a change in the sample matrix making the vitamin less extractable.</p><p class="otherpara">Metals and their associated metalloproteins are involved in a number of biochemical processes, including those associated with hypertension which is an established risk factor for stroke. The group of Caruso has been working on <span class="italic">the development of metallomic techniques</span> to investigate various forms of stroke. They have studied metal containing proteins in blood plasma using SEC-ICP-MS, followed by HPLC-ES-IT-MS using a microfluidic HPLC-chip column for peptide measurements after trypsin digestion and database searches to identify the proteins.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> Using the total concentration of the metal associated with the metalloproteins containing that element and separated using SEC, the Mg, Mn, Cu, Se concentrations were statistically different when compared between stroke mimics (control group) <span class="italic">vs.</span> ischemic stroke patients and ischemic stroke patients <span class="italic">vs.</span> haemorrhagic stroke patients. Lead concentrations were statistically different when compared between stroke mimics <span class="italic">vs.</span> ischemic stroke patients and Mo levels were statistically the same among the three groups. Although specific metalloprotein biomarkers for stroke were not identified, the preliminary study showed scope for further investigation. In a similar vein<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250</span></sup></a> the same group have also studied the Se metallome in an effort to find biomarkers for cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke. The analytical protocol once again involved SEC-ICP-MS as a first step to isolate the selenoproteins. This was followed by 1D GE, excision and in-gel trypsin digestion of the individual protein bands and analysis of the peptide fragments by MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS. Six proteins including: albumin preprotein; beta globin; carbonic anhydrase I; transthyretin precursor; peroxiredoxin I; and cystatin S precursor, were identified. Of these proteins all may be feasible as biomarkers of cerebral vasospasm, but the most promising was felt to be transthyretin precursor. Strangely no <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> corresponding to known Se species were detected in the SEC fraction containing the largest amount of Se. This illustrates one of the major problems with both approaches, in that the proteins identified in the isolated SEC fractions may not actually contain any metal(loid) or be a metalloprotein, but could just be co-eluting with a metal containing compound. The resolution obtained with SEC is not a high and one would expect a multitude of proteins to be present in the “isolated” fractions. It's also unclear what advantage focusing on the metalloproteins has in comparison with the other well established proteomics methods available which consider the complete proteome rather than just the metallome. Although the authors show some link between metals and the disease this approach could well lead investigations away from better biomarkers. A different metallomic approach<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> has been developed to investigate transgenic and non-transgenic soyabean seeds using 2D HPLC-ICP-MS and HPLC-ES-MS-MS. In this protocol herbicide resistant transgenic soyabean seeds and normal seeds were subjected to an ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.2) extraction procedure followed by separation into three metal (Co, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn) containing fractions by SEC. The fractions were freeze-dried, redissolved in Tris buffer (pH not reported) and separated using AEX into 7 further fractions, which were lyophilised and digested using trypsin, prior to analysis by HPLC-ES-MS-MS using a C<small><sub>18</sub></small> column. The resulting peptides were then searched against the NCBI and Swiss-Prot databases using the MASCOT search engine in the usual proteomics approach. A total of 33 proteins were identified amongst which some related to metals were found, although the majority of the proteins do not appear to bind metals, so it is unclear what function the metals studied have in relation to them. Further work, perhaps using IMAC, to refine the isolation of the metal-binding molecules would appear necessary.</p><h3 id="sect2128"><span class="b_heading">6.2 Tagging and labelling of molecules</span></h3><span>Elemental labelling is an expanding area of research and encompasses the <span class="italic">indirect determination of biomolecules by labelling with metals</span>, nanoparticles or quantum dots. A variety of labelling methods are being investigated but all involve a ligand or antibody which has a metal attached, either by chelation or covalent bonding, that tags the target molecule.

This approach has been applied to a variety of research areas including: the measurement of peptides, proteins and antibodies in a range of applications including biomedical science,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252</span></sup></a> medicine<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> and art conservation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit254"><sup><span class="sup_ref">254</span></sup></a></span><p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">strategies, methods and chelators employed to label biomolecules</span> such as proteins, peptides and antibodies have started to be investigated and optimised. A group from NIST<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit255"><sup><span class="sup_ref">255</span></sup></a> evaluated the use of microwave energy when metal-labelling peptides for measurement by RP HPLC-ICP-MS. A microwave-assisted lanthanide labelling procedure was developed and applied to derivatise the peptides angiotensin I and II, and bradykinin, using the macrocyclic bifunctional chemical chelator DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid), which significantly improved the lanthanide labelling yield and reduced reaction times compared to bench top labelling procedures. The bio-conjugation step required buffering the samples to pH 8, and reaction of the peptides with DOTA NHS ester for 5–10 min using a temperature ramp and a hold program to a maximum of 60 °C at 300 W power. Lanthanide spikes of Ho, Tb or Tm in formic acid (0.1% m/m) at pH 6 were introduced and the samples were then heated again in the MW for 5 min to chelate the metal to the DOTA-derivatised peptides. Polymeric RF SPE cartridges (Strata X and Oasis HLB) were used to remove the unconjugated metals. Both MALDI-TOF-MS and ES-MS-MS were used to evaluate labelling efficiencies, which were approximately 55% for the microwave method, compared to 15% for the bench-top approach. The RP separation used a microbore C<small><sub>18</sub></small> column, an acetonitrile gradient, which required O<small><sub>2</sub></small> addition and the spray chamber cooled to −5 °C to allow the plasma to tolerate the high organic modifier loading (98.5% v/v). The MSA calibration scheme was outlined in detail and applied by labelling the standard and sample with different lanthanides and combining the derivatised solutions, prior to the SPE step. Correction of the lanthanide signals for oxide formation in the ICP-MS was required to achieve accurate results. Whilst not used on real-world samples, the methodology showed promising recoveries of 99.1% for bradykinin using Tb as the spike label. Jakubowski and co-workers have compared<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a> different chelates for lanthanide labelling of antibodies for application in biomedical assays utilising LA-ICP-MS detection. The lanthanide labelling of antibodies using the metal coded tagging (MeCAT) approach was investigated and the reaction conditions were optimised for application in a Western blot immunoassay analysed by LA-ICP-MS. The MeCAT labelling strategy was compared with two other commercially available labelling reagents, MAXPAR™ and SCN-DOTA. All three of these approaches involved the use of a bi-functional ligand containing a portion which strongly chelated a rare earth metal tag. This moiety was reacted with a specific amino acid group on the antibody. The SCN-DOTA covalently bonded to ε-amino acid groups of lysine residues and the DOTA macrocycle complexed the Tb lanthanide tag. The other two methods. MeCAT and MAXPAR™, both label <span class="italic">via</span> a maleimide group which binds to the sulfhydryl residues after partial reduction of the antibody's cysteine-based disulfide bridges. The MeCAT approach uses the DOTA complex in a similar manner to SCN-DOTA, whereas MAXPAR™ uses a polymer chain containing diethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid (DTTA) a linear metal chelating compound, which increases the number of Tm lanthanide tags per binding site. As a proof-of-principle experiment, chemically induced alterations of cytochrome P450 protein expression were investigated and the suitability of the differentially labelled antibodies for Western blot immunoassays of a complex liver microsomal protein fraction tested. Lower fmol range LODs were reported for the Western blot application using MeCAT and MAXPAR™ as element labelling reagents, whereas sub-fmol LODs could be achieved in a dot blot experiment for the pure antibodies.</p><p class="otherpara">Further work on <span class="italic">MeCAT labelling</span> has focused on the absolute quantification of proteins rather than relative quantification using analyte abundance. In a series of recent papers protocols have been reported for the application of MeCAT labelling to: the thermally induced expression of the clotting factor aprotinin by 2D GE followed by FI-ICP-MS and nanoHPLC-ES-MS-MS;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> the measurement of lysosyme, BSA and transferrin by 2D-HPLC-ICP-MS;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit258"><sup><span class="sup_ref">258</span></sup></a> and HSA and transferrin in human serum by 2D GE with LA-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a> The Linscheid group show<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> that the MeCAT labelling process can be applied to the measurement of a single protein, in this case recombinantly produced aprotinin. This could be achieved using both a bottom–up strategy, after labelling of the peptides resulting from tryptic digest and also a top-down process, labelling the cysteine residues of the intact protein. The bottom–up method requires that characteristic peptides for the protein are identified using nanoHPLC-ESI-MS-MS and then synthesised, prior to labelling for use as internal standards for absolute quantitation. To illustrate the application of the method, peptides from before thermal induction of aprotinin were labelled with Lu and those after with Ho, and HPLC-ICP-MS was used to demonstrate the difference in level of expression. This would not be possible with relative quantification methods because the protein is not expressed at normal temperatures. The main drawback with this approach was the 7 hours chromatographic run required to separate the peptides. The top–down system, labelling the intact protein directly, has the advantage that information is not lost due to the digestion step and sample complexity is kept to a minimum. Using the same labelling approach, proteins were separated by 2D-GE and the stained spots excised and analysed by ICP-MS. The results showed the absence of thermally induced protein in the unheated treatment as before. Accurate quantification using this approach requires the tagged and untagged forms of a protein to migrate in electrophoresis in a similar manner. This was not elucidated in the presented results, where the MeCAT tagged species are located in a different manner to the unlabelled species. To assess the accuracy delivered by both MeCAT workflows, the results were compared to a reference method. The top–down approach gave recoveries of 174% and 198% for the two thermal comparisons and the bottom–up approach yielded 55% and 40%. The precision was reported as between 24 and 45%.</p><p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">tags such as nanoparticles or quantum-dots</span> containing a large number of metal atoms increases the sensitivity of the method compared to other labelling techniques.

On exposure to the target DNA the probe unfurled to hybridise with the DNA sequence, releasing the Hg-tag which is detected by CE-ICP-MS. The CE step effectively separated the released Hg-tag from the remaining Hg-labelled capture DNA sequence. As SNPs are introduced into the measured single strand DNA, less of the Hg is released from the capture loop. As this occurs stoichiometrically it is possible to measure the number and magnitude of SNPs present by the concentration of unbound Hg. The method can only identify the specific SNP by the capture DNA sequence used, which makes the approach cumbersome and somewhat tedious as the capture probe would have to be specific to the SNP being investigated. However, this is also the case for molecular beacon probes, upon which this work is based. The methodology was only employed with synthetic DNA sequences and not to real world situations, so it is difficult to see how the approach, whilst novel, improves upon the current methods for SNP detection and quantitation.</p><h3 id="sect2160"><span class="b_heading">6.3 Imaging by LA-ICP-MS</span></h3><span>The use of LA-ICP-MS for imaging is an expanding area of research, particularly in the biomedical field. It involves the use of direct laser sampling to provide a spatial analysis that can be represented as an elemental map or image of a material, or a planar separation. The field also encompasses direct measurement of hetero or metal containing molecules and indirect determination by labelling molecules with metals or nanoparticles.</span><p class="otherpara">Two recent <span class="italic">reviews highlight the quantification strategies that are essential to obtaining useful data from LA-ICP-MS</span> studies. Hare <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> cover a range of calibration approaches that have been used to assess the spatial distribution of specific trace elements in a range of human and animal derived biomaterials, including: hair, thin brain tissue sections, human teeth, animal liver sections, leaves, and other materials such as glass, geological materials and PAGE gels. Internal standardisation, discussed in some detail in this review, is necessary with LA-ICP-MS analysis to overcome changes in elemental response. These effects may be caused by fluctuations in laser output power, variations in the mass and transport efficiency of ablated material, plasma instability and surface imperfections (particularly with gels) leading to slight changes in height relative to the focus position of the laser. The most suitable approach is to use a naturally occurring element found within the matrix of the material under investigation. Ideally the element used should be present at a known concentration and have similar ablation properties as the analyte. Some examples presented include: Ca for signal normalisation in teeth, S in hair analysis, and <small><sup>13</sup></small>C in tissue samples. Alternatives to the use of elemental internal standardisation as a means to compensate for variation in ablated mass have been proposed including normalisation by acoustic wave generation and measurement of light scattered by ablated particles. The calibration approaches discussed included: matrix matched standards and pelleted CRMs; on-line addition of solution standards; IDMS after spiking or doping of different materials; and direct printing of standards onto a suitable support. Whilst this review dealt predominantly with total and spatial elemental analysis it did also include a discussion of the analysis of 2D PAGE gels, using the heteroatoms such as S present in the separated protein spots and the metals also present, to quantify the amount of protein. The calibration and internal standardisation methods discussed were shown to be applicable to the determination of metalloproteins using LA-ICP-MS. However, the second review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> specifically addressed the measurement of heteroatom containing proteins and proteins labelled with metal-containing tags. The main and most useful feature of LA-ICP-MS is its spatial resolution (&lt;1 μm), which is reported to be better than micro-XRF. However, the downside of this is the length of time required for data acquisition, which can be anything up to 30 h for a high resolution “image” of a 5 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> specimen. The lack of validated quantification strategies is another limitation of the approach. The bioimaging of elements in human and animal tissues; tissue sample preparation; quantification and internal standardisation; analysis of heteroatom-containing proteins and electrophoresis gels; and elemental tagging for peptide and protein analysis were also assessed in the review. Whilst biomedical applications of the technique are stressed in the paper, it is difficult to see how it could be applied in mainstream biomedical science. Transfer out of the research laboratory into the clinic does not seem likely at the current level of development.</p><p class="otherpara">One area of biomedical science that would benefit from the development of LA-ICP-MS applications is histopathology, which currently uses staining and immunochemistry of tissue biopsy samples to identify biomarkers of disease.</p><p class="otherpara">The group of Jakubowski has worked on the use of immunochemical labelling and ICP-MS for a number of years and have now developed a <span class="italic">multiplexed immunohistochemical method for the detection of tumour biomarkers</span> in breast cancer tissue using LA-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> This approach is essentially based on the biopsy samples and protocols widely in use in histopathological centres. Three antibodies with a high degree of selectivity for a specific tumour marker were labelled, each with a different lanthanide. Antihuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her 2), anticytokeratin 7 (CK 7) and antimucin 1 (MUC 1) were labelled with Ho, Tm and Tb respectively using a DOTA complex as a linker. Conventional formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of human breast cancer biopsies were sectioned (5 μm thick) by microtome and then incubated with the labelled antibodies. The sections were then mounted onto microscope glass slides and analysed by LA coupled to SF-ICP-MS. The instrumental parameters were optimised for optimal signal-to-background ratio and the total analysis time for a tissue (6 mm × 5 mm) was 1 h using a 200 μm laser spot size and a 200 μm s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> scan speed. Whilst inferior in spatial resolution to light microscopy, by a factor of 10 to 100, the advantages of the approach are: the possibility for quantification; simultaneous detection of several biomarkers within one tissue section even if they are colocalised; and shorter analysis time than conventional histopathological methods due to multiplexing several markers simultaneously.</p><p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">analysis of macromolecules separated using gel-electrophoresis or microarrays using LA-ICP-MS</span> has been the subject of a number of reports.

Two different quantification strategies were studied: external calibration using standards of the derivatised protein and <small><sup>13</sup></small>C correction; and label-specific IDA using pHMB enriched in the isotope <small><sup>199</sup></small>Hg. Normalisation to the matrix element C significantly improved the calibration correlation and precision. The IDA approach overcame the inhomogeneous distribution of the protein within the gel band, to provide accurate results and could also compensate for analyte loss and degradation as soon as complete mixture of spike and sample was achieved. The estimated LOD was 160 fmol for ovalbumin. In contrast to earlier studies using metals naturally present in proteins, no loss of mercury was observed during separation under denaturing conditions and other sample preparation steps. Using label-specific IDA, the measured isotope ratios in the gel corresponded to recoveries between 95% and 103%. The determination of Pt-containing protein complexes in biological samples,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> after cisplatin treatment, has been developed using GE and spatial analysis by LA-ICP-SF-MS. Spots containing Pt were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin so the peptides produced could be identified using nHPLC-ES-LTQ-FT-MS/MS. The influence of protein separation conditions, staining and gel processing prior to LA on Pt-protein bonds preservation were evaluated using standard proteins incubated with cisplatin. Separation under non-reducing conditions followed by either Coomassie blue brilliant or silver staining were both successful, achieving a suitable resolution between protein bands. Direct LA-ICP-MS analysis of glycerol-treated dried gels for Pt-protein monitoring resulted in better sensitivity, more reliable relative Pt signals and a simpler and less time-consuming approach compared to the analysis of blotted membranes. Ablation of the gels identified the Pt containing spots and the colocalised proteins could then be identified by molecular MS, making it unnecessary to run several gels in parallel for separate Pt detection and protein identification. However, the need to digest the proteins for characterisation means that information on cisplatin–protein binding is lost, which would appear to be a major drawback of the approach.
