      <p class="otherpara">One can categorize methods of the nanomaterial synthesis in many ways, but the most general is based on the state of the precursors from which the NPs are formed: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down methods include ball milling, electrochemical etching, photolithographic patterning, and other approaches that break or pattern larger materials to produce nanomaterials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> In contrast, bottom-up methods start from atomic or molecular precursors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> Two general subcategories can be considered for the bottom-up methods based on the phase in which nanomaterial synthesis occurs, namely solution-phase and vapor-phase. Particle formation in solution-phase methods is initiated by heating, by addition of a second precursor compound, or by addition of a reducing agent or other reactive species. Generally, in these methods, the precursor or mixture of precursors, which can be liquid or solid, reacts in liquid solution leading to nucleation and growth of solid particles. These primary particles can grow <span class="italic">via</span> surface reaction, and may aggregate. Many kinds of nanomaterials, especially metal nanocrystals and quantum dots are synthesized by solution-phase methods. Surfactants or ligands, molecules that bind to the nanoparticle (NP) surface, are used to control the growth of particles and limit the particle size. The most important solution-phase methods are sol–gel, hydrothermal, solvothermal, thermal decomposition, and micelle/reverse-micelle methods.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> In vapor-phase methods, precursors must be delivered as a vapor or as small droplets or particles that can be vaporized within the process. An energy source is generally required to initiate and sustain physical evaporation and/or chemical reaction in the vapor phase.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The vapor phase should be supersaturated to drive the formation of a solid phase. At a sufficient level of supersaturation, nucleation occurs homogeneously. Often, this supersaturation is in the form of vapor-phase atoms or molecules present at a partial pressure above their vapor pressure. However, it can also take the form of “chemical” supersaturation, in which vapor-phase molecules are thermodynamically unstable relative to a solid that can form from them by chemical reaction. In any case, once particles have nucleated, the system should be rapidly quenched to stop particle growth and sintering. A wide range of materials can be synthesized by these methods, but non-toxic semiconductors and metal oxides have been particularly important. Vapor-phase methods can operate at much higher temperature and shorter reaction times than solution-phase methods, which allows crystallization of high melting point materials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26,27</span></sup></a> However, solution-phase synthesis can directly produce a stable colloidal dispersion of the NPs, in which aggregation of particles does not occur. Ligands and surfactants can be used to control the size and shape of nanomaterials to a degree that is not generally possible in vapor-phase processes. Aerosols, dispersions of the product particles in a vapor, are inherently unstable, and primary particles invariably aggregate into larger clusters of particles. When this happens after quenching, it produces “soft” aggregates that can subsequently be broken up. However, when the particles become partially sintered into “hard” aggregates, the clustering is irreversible.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> Such aggregates may be desirable or undesirable depending upon the ultimate application. <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a> compares key features of solution-phase and vapor-phase NP synthesis methods to concisely summarize the relative advantages and disadvantages of these broad categories of nanosynthesis. For those who may be less familiar with the terminology of vapor-phase synthesis and aerosol science and technology in general, a list of definitions of key terms is provided at the end of this review.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">The main focus of this review is on vapor-phase processes for the synthesis of free-standing nanomaterials. Several rather comprehensive reviews of this field were published 15 to 25 years ago.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27,29,30</span></sup></a> More recent reviews have focused on particular subsets of vapor-phase synthesis methods or particular applications.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31–38</span></sup></a> Thus, a new review that takes a broad and relatively comprehensive approach, as presented here, is needed. That being said, there are some areas outside the scope of this review. The deposition of nanomaterials into films and growth of nanostructured films from the vapor phase is a very broad topic which we do not include, as is the literature on soot formation in flames, which we only touch on briefly. These and other aspects that we chose not to include are noted in relevant sections below.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">To provide structure to this review, we categorize vapor-phase synthesis techniques into three classes of physically-based, plasma-processing-based, and chemically-based methods based on the similarity of chemical structures of the precursors to the final products. While this classification is only one of several possibilities, and there is some inherent overlap between categories, we believe it provides a valuable framework for organizing, comparing, and contrasting methods. Within this framework, we survey the history and recent advances in each method with a focus on the nanosynthesis technique and the pros and cons of each process. After initial introduction of each method, we consider the most important nanomaterials synthesized by each method in greater detail, to illustrate how to the method can be employed to drive interesting applications.</p>
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect658"><span class="a_heading">2. Vapor-phase production methods</span></h2>
      <span>Interest in vapor-phase (aerosol) nanomaterial synthesis is driven by several key advantages relative to solution-phase methods. The unavoidable impurities and liquid (solvent) wastes generated by solution-phase methods as well as the use of relatively expensive surfactants or ligands can be avoided in most vapor-phase methods. Production of nanomaterials without organic ligands on their surface can be particularly important for electronic applications. Complex structures such as high-temperature superconductors can be produced in the vapor phase, leveraging their ability to produce nanomaterials with complex compositions and crystal structure at high temperature. Vapor-phase methods are continuous, while solution-phase methods are usually conducted batch-wise. Continuous operation may enable improved control and reproducibility as well as productivity and scalability.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29,39</span></sup></a> There are various ways to categorize aerosol synthesis methods based on the energy source or based on the state of the precursors, but here we first classify the methods based on the similarity of chemical structure between the precursors and the product nanomaterials, into three classes of physically-based vapor-phase synthesis, plasma processing, and chemically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods. For example, if we produce silicon NPs from silicon wafers, that is a physically-based process, but if we use silane as the precursor, the method will be classified as chemically-based. Plasma processing methods can employ both types of precursors. Overlap among these categories is inevitable, but such classification is nonetheless useful.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect663"><span class="b_heading">2.1. Physically-based vapor-phase production methods</span></h3>
        <span>Physically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods are aerosol synthesis methods in which the product materials are of essentially the same composition as the precursors, or perhaps a simple compound (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> oxide) based on the precursors. In general, the main advantage of these methods is the synthesis of nanomaterials with a high degree of purity and the major disadvantage is the synthesis of small quantities of material per batch or per unit time. The most important methods that can be considered in this category are inert gas condensation (using conventional thermal evaporation, e-beam evaporation, or sputtering as the evaporation technique), spark discharge generation, and pulsed laser ablation.</span>

          <span id="sect668"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.1.1. Inert gas condensation. </span>
          <span>To achieve supersaturation in this technique, an inorganic material is heated to a temperature at which it will sublime or evaporate into an inert gas atmosphere at reduced pressure, typically 1–50 mbar. Mixing of this vapor with cooler gas induces nucleation by condensation. This method is suitable for producing metal nanomaterials because of their evaporation at acceptable rates at practical temperatures. However, outgassing due to undesirable heating of other reactor parts is a major disadvantage of the method. To produce oxides or non-oxide compounds, a reactive gas like O<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be added to the cold inert gas. The type of inert gas, the gas pressure, and the vapor pressure of the evaporating materials can influence the particle size distribution, which critically depends on the residence time of the particles in the growth region of the process.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29,30</span></sup></a><a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> provides a summary and <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> presents representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of materials synthesized using this approach.</span>

They employed resistive heating to evaporate pure cerium and copper granules with He as the inert gas in a UHV chamber with a base pressure below 10<small><sup>−9</sup></small> Torr. They placed two or three tungsten crucibles simultaneously in the reactor.

They reported that the inert gas pressure and the composition of the composite had the most substantial effects on the morphology of the NPs.

The experimental set-up is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6</a>. The reactor had three main parts: the sputter source, a collection cold finger, and a scraping device. Because of its small sputtering yield, they were not able to use He as the inert gas for the synthesis. For the pure metals (Mo and Al) they used DC power of up to 1200 W and currents of 2 and 4.5 A which corresponded to voltages in the range of 200 to 400 V. NPs were synthesized at Ar pressures in the range of 0.3 to 2 mbar. Sputtering of Mo and Al targets under these conditions produced NPs with average sizes of 20 and 30 nm, respectively. They synthesized Cu NPs with an average size of ∼15 nm at Ar pressures from 0.1 to 1 mbar and sputter currents of 0.5 to 3 A. If we consider the vapor pressures at evaporation temperatures (1300 °C for Cu and Mn and 1800 °C for Ti and Al) of Cu (4.0 Pa), Mn (400 pa), Ti (40 Pa), and Al (5320 Pa), we can understand that conventional thermal evaporation methods are not appropriate for the synthesis of CuMn (with magnetic properties of interest) and TiAl (with useful high-temperature mechanical properties) alloys.

Kesälä <span class="italic">et al.</span> performed classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the pressure dependence of cluster growth in IGC. They varied pressure by changing the simulation volume while holding other parameters, including initial temperature and the number of atoms, constant. The background gas in their simulations was argon, and the metal atoms were initially given a higher temperature than the background gas, which was thermostatted at 300 K, allowing them to simulate energy transfer from the metal vapor to the inert gas. Simulating systems of various metal vapours modelled with appropriate interatomic interaction potentials enabled them to investigate the effect of pressure by simulating the initial stages of the inert gas growth process at five pressures in each case. They observed an inverse relation between the initial metal vapor partial pressure and the condensation time. In addition, their studies showed that the molecular mass and lattice constant of the metal are the key factors determining the condensation time. Notably, they derived an analytical model for the condensation time based on the kinetic theory of gases with the basic assumptions of classical nucleation theory for a homogeneous vapor. They were able to predict the time scale of cluster formation for various metals with different atomic mass and lattice constant, showing that materials with larger atomic mass formed clusters more slowly, while faster clustering was observed with increasing lattice constant.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a></p>

This both simplifies modelling and allows production of relatively monodispersed particles. A key value of this model was its utility for identifying effective operating conditions for new materials, provided their thermodynamic properties are well established, prior to beginning experiments.</p>

The evolution of the number of clusters with time was almost independent of composition, because it is governed by aggregation. However, the overall cohesive energy of the clusters increased with increasing Pt content, simply because the cohesive energy of bulk Pt is higher than that of Pd. Moreover, they found that smaller nanoclusters, which were approximately spherical, had sharper peaks in the radial distribution function compared to the larger nanoclusters, which adopted a variety of shapes, depending on their history. Furthermore, they proposed that the smaller cohesive energy of palladium could explain the observation of palladium atoms in the outer shells of the nanoalloy, while the inner shells were primarily composed of platinum.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> They performed the same type of molecular dynamic simulations for the IGC of Ni–Pt nanoalloys.

In all these nanoalloys, the surface of the clusters was dominated by gold atoms, while the other element formed the core, which can be attributed to the low surface energy of gold. The Au-Ru and Au–Pt nanoalloys adopted fcc- and hcp-like crystal structures in the core part of the nanoclusters, while the gold surface atoms were amorphous. In addition, Au–Cu nanoalloys had more spherical morphology compared to the other nanoalloys because of the greater mobility of Cu relative to the heavier elements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a></p>

Furthermore, they observed that the liquid-to-solid transition initiated in the core and propagated toward the outer layers, producing lamellar fcc/hcp layers or multiple-fold twins through internal structural relaxation.

            <p class="otherpara">Wen and Xia developed an energy analysis model to predict the size of magnesium NPs as a determining factor for the properties of NPs. This approach involves computing the total energy of a cluster and the rates of energy deposition (due to condensation of atoms onto the cluster) and energy dissipation as clusters grow. This method employs analytical expressions for the various energies and rate processes involved, in contrast to the MD approaches described previously. The energy analysis was successful in predicting the size of IGC-synthesized magnesium NPs, in the range of 20–50 nm, to within 10%. The model was then used to identify operating conditions that would produce smaller NPs. Both increasing temperature and decreasing pressure can lead to a decrease in the size of NPs, and the effect of temperature is more significant.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> They also predicted the morphology of aluminium NPs synthesized by IGC using an extension of this method. Gibbs energy and the energy variation of clusters during the process (due to energy deposition and dissipation) were considered to work together to determine the morphology of NPs, driving the transition from quasi-spherical to faceted nanocrystals. They observed, in their model of IGC synthesis of Al NPs, that the energy change during the synthesis process played a more significant role in determining the morphology when the cooling rate was below 2 × 10<small><sup>11</sup></small> K s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Moreover, they reported that although a spherical morphology is the most stable one at short times, a cubic morphology became more dominant as the NPs grew. This transition is driven by the greater rate of energy dissipation from a cube, compared to a sphere. The pressure of the condensation chamber was the most important factor to determine the point at which the morphology changed from spherical to cubic. Based on this model, they concluded that the pressure in the condensation chamber and the cooling rate were the main parameters controlling morphology in this IGC synthesis process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a></p>

They found that compact 3D configurations were favourable and these followed an icosahedral growth pattern for all compositions. For the clusters with silver as the major element, the strongly bound cobalt dopants adopted highly-coordinated positions. However, when cobalt was the major element, loosely bound silver atoms were poorly coordinated at the cluster surface.

          <span>In this technique, the precursors take the form of two electrodes that are rapidly charged to high voltage, such that the electric field between them exceeds the threshold for breakdown field of the gas between them. A plasma spark is generated between the electrodes, with a temperature that can exceed 20<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 K, which vaporizes small quantities of the electrode materials in the vicinity of the spark. Rapid cooling following the spark leads to nucleation of NPs of the electrode material. Because the volume of the spark is small, this approach typically yields very small quantities of nanomaterials. As in other aerosol nanosynthesis methods, the nanomaterials are mixed with an unheated inert gas to stop their growth and limit the particle size. Compared to other evaporation-condensation techniques, the small vapor cloud allows more rapid cooling below the boiling point which generates a high concentration of very small particles. By varying the composition of the electrodes and employing reactive gases, a wide variety of nanomaterials including pure metals, composites, alloys, oxides, hybrids, and semiconductors can be produced with this process. Spark discharge generation is an environmentally friendly technique, because it produces NPs of the same materials that comprise the electrodes, without producing waste such as reaction byproducts or solvents. Also, this technique can generate nanomaterials with good reproducibility and high purity. In addition, simultaneous spark evaporation of multiple materials can produce unique new phases. However, the synthesis of nanomaterials at very low production rates and difficulties associated with variation in the breakdown voltage, which leads to variation in the energy per spark, are notable disadvantages of this method.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27,166,167</span></sup></a> Although size, number concentration, chemical composition, morphology, and surface area of the NPs can be controlled in this method, these factors cannot each be controlled independently.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a><a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a> provides a summary and <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12</a> presents representative TEM images of nanomaterials synthesized using this approach.</span>

They used a power supply with a maximum voltage of 12 kV in constant current mode, which could be varied between 0 and 1 mA (corresponding to spark frequencies from 0 to 50 Hz), to charge a 2.2 nF capacitor. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. To avoid loss of charged particles by electrostatic precipitation to charged insulators, they used a conductive Al housing and outlet tube.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> Their group also worked to scale-up the process to an industrial level for synthesis of ultrapure non-agglomerated singlet NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> They also studied the synthesis of silver atomic clusters using an atmospheric pressure generation technique and were successful in producing atomic clusters ranging from 1 to 25 atoms in size.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">151</span></sup></a></span>

            <p class="otherpara">Many metallic vapor-phase synthesized nanomaterials can be easily oxidized by impurities in the carrier gas. This is a problem when the nanomaterials are later pressed and sintered to produce bulk samples with nanoscale grains, because oxide layers are incorporated. This can be mitigated by adding hydrogen during sintering. Hallberg <span class="italic">et al.</span> proposed an alternative strategy to prevent oxidation during the synthesis process. They mixed 5% hydrogen into the nitrogen used as the carrier gas in spark discharge synthesis of Au, Co, Bi, and Sn NPs using electrodes that were separated by 2 mm and eroded by a spark generator with a 10-mA constant current power supply charging a 38 nF capacitor. They compared the resulting NPs with those synthesized using nitrogen as the carrier gas, sintering each in a hydrogen mixture to demonstrate the advantage of their strategy. They found that the crystal quality of Bi and Sn synthesized using their strategy was remarkably higher than that produced using the conventional strategy. Thus, they concluded that their strategy can improve sintering of NPs into compact nanocrystalline metals by preventing the generation of oxide layers on the as-synthesized NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit134"><sup><span class="sup_ref">134</span></sup></a></p>

            <p class="otherpara">Němec <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a spark discharge generator for the synthesis of platinum and platinum oxide NPs. A schematic of their system is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14</a>. It comprised a stainless-steel cylinder fitted with several ports, including two horizontal ports to accommodate 2 mm platinum rod electrodes. A modified TIG plasma torch held each electrode, allowing both electrical connection and liquid cooling. They employed a 2 mm tungsten rod as an auxiliary electrode to initiate the high-power sparks and stabilize their frequency. The cathode was powered and the anode was grounded. High-voltage probes and a current probe were used to monitor the process. Two vertical ports served as inlet and outlet for the carrier gas. The nozzle was engineered to produce parallel uniform streams directed toward the spark zone. In the unipolar set-up, the cathode is evaporated as the main source of NPs and is eroded. To synthesize platinum NPs, they used a 95<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>5 mixture of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>:H<small><sub>2</sub></small> (forming gas) as the carrier gas. Spark discharge in air produced platinum oxide NPs. The crystallinity of the platinum NPs was higher and their size was smaller than the platinum oxide NPs.

In their spark generator, a 10 nF capacitor was charged at 2 mA by applying a voltage of 3 kV, producing sparks at 667 Hz. The short spark duration was advantageous for rapid cooling downstream of the spark.

            <p class="otherpara">Ahmad <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a novel rod-to-tube type spark generator to generate monometallic and bimetallic NPs for use in catalysis. A schematic of their apparatus is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15</a>. It comprised a spark chamber made from a polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) tee. Rod and tube electrodes were placed in opposing inlets of the tee, which provided electrical isolation. To synthesize monometallic NPs, these two electrodes were composed of the same metal, while for bimetallic NPs electrodes of two different metals were used. The rod and tube electrodes both had a diameter of 6.35 mm, but to place one end of the rod inside the tube at its center, that end was sharpened. The tube also served as the aerosol outlet. The third inlet of the tee was used to introduce the carrier gas (Ar or N<small><sub>2</sub></small>) at 0.5 to 3.3 lpm. They used a high-voltage (up to 20 kV) source and current of 10 mA to charge a high-voltage external capacitor of 0.1–1 nF capacitance, which in turn was connected in parallel to the spark gap by a 1 MΩ ballast resistor. With this reactor configuration, they synthesized Fe, Ni, and Cu as monometallic catalysts with average sizes of 5.17, 5.46, and 4.54 nm, respectively, and Co–Ni and Co–Fe as bimetallic catalysts with average sizes of 4.72 and 4.90 nm, respectively. When a copper electrode was used, higher capacitance was required, which they attributed to the high thermal conductivity of copper. They also studied the effect of carrier gas flow rate on the size and number concentration of NPs and found that increasing the carrier gas flow rate decreased particle size and increased number concentration due to faster cooling and reduced residence time. Changing the carrier gas from nitrogen to argon decreased both the size and the number concentration of the NPs because of lower discharge voltage and effective discharge energy per spark in argon. Notably, their process could maintain a constant size distribution of NPs for 24 hours.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a></p>

They used two different types of electrodes: (a) intrinsic silicon rods with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 6 cm and (b) boron-doped silicon rods with a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 6 cm and they found the latter case led to a thousand-fold increase in mass production. Silicon can be easily oxidized upon exposure to oxygen. To avoid this, they made the system oxygen- and water-free by gas purification, outgassing, and the use of as-synthesized particles as getters.

          <span>Laser ablation is a laser-driven technique to synthesize nanomaterials from a bulk solid precursor. It involves vaporizing a plume of material using a laser. Most often, this is a pulsed laser that produces a transient vapor plume, but some continuous laser ablation processes have also been reported. Key advantages of the method are that it can vaporize materials that cannot otherwise easily be evaporated, can produce high-purity nanomaterials, can use many different target materials alone or in combination, and can produce NPs with various compositions.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27,174</span></sup></a> A major disadvantage of this approach is that only small amounts of nanomaterials can be produced.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27,175</span></sup></a> The requirement of a complex non-isothermal system, very limited demonstration of scale-up, and expensive equipment are other limitations of the method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> In addition to aerosol generation of NPs, this approach has been widely used for the synthesis of nanomaterials by vaporizing solid precursors in liquid or supercritical fluid media and for the production of thin films, both of which are beyond the scope of this review. <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a> provides a summary and <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19</a> presents representative TEM images of nanomaterials synthesized in a gaseous atmosphere using this approach.</span>

            <span>Dietz, Duncan, Powers, and Smalley pioneered pulsed laser ablation with supersonic expansion for the synthesis of Al clusters. They employed a Nd:YAG pulsed laser producing 80 mJ per pulse to vaporize an Al plug within a pulsed supersonic nozzle. The vaporized metal atoms were entrained in the expanding helium which led to formation of a supersonic beam of Al clusters at 1.2 m downstream of the nozzle, which was operated at 10 pulses per second in a He atmosphere with a 28.5 atm backing pressure.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a> Although their set-up was effectively generating the Al clusters, they found some problems regarding reproducibility and stability of the Al cluster signals. They found that the pulsed laser quickly drilled deep holes on the surface of the target which made vaporization at the same spot extremely difficult. Accordingly, they changed the set-up to move the target before each laser pulse. With this modification, they generated Cu clusters containing 1 to 13 Cu atoms with a high degree of reproducibility. During the pulsed vaporization in a He background using a Nd:YAG laser, they rotated and translated a Cu rod to achieve uniform vaporization at a frequency of 10 Hz with 5 to 50 mJ laser pulses.

            <span>Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span> first reported the synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) using pulsed laser ablation. They explained that carbon condensation in an inert atmosphere heated to 1200 °C will lead to self-assembly of MWCNT due to its inherent growth mechanism, which stabilizes the open conformation against closure. This contrasted with prior syntheses in which some extrinsic factor such as catalytic metal particles, high electric fields, hydrogen atoms, or a surface at low temperature helped to keep the MWCNT structure open at its growing end. To produce MWCNTs, they ablated a 1.25 cm diameter graphite rod in an Ar atmosphere using a Nd:YAG pulsed laser at 532 nm, emitting 250 mJ per pulse, with a pulse width of 10 ns, and repetition rate of 10 Hz. The ablation was conducted in a temperature-controlled quartz tube furnace at 1200 °C in high-purity Ar. They deposited the synthesized carbon species on a conical water-cooled copper rod.

Among the single metal-graphite composite targets, Ni had the highest yield followed by Co while the yield for Pt was very small. Cu and Nb did not produce any SWCNT. Among the bimetal-graphite composite targets, Co/Pt and Co/Ni had the highest yields, which were 10–100 times the yields obtained using single metal-composite targets. The yield for Ni/Pt was slightly less, while the Co/Cu composite had a small yield.

They produced these using a two-part system with a separate energy source part and a reaction part. This configuration is similar to the laser pyrolysis synthesis set-up that is discussed in detail in a later section. The energy source was a high power 10.6-μm-CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser with a maximum power of 5 kW, variable pulse duration from 10 ms to continuous-wave operation, and beam diameter of 10 mm. The reaction part included a plastic-resin reaction chamber with dimensions of 30 × 30 × 25 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> to which a ZnSe lens system was attached to adjust the beam intensity. The ablation target was a graphite rod with a diameter of 30 mm and length of 50 mm, which was placed at the center of the reaction chamber and rotated around its axis at a rate of 6 rpm to continuously expose a fresh surface. After pre-evacuation of the chamber, Ar at 760 Torr and a flow rate of 40 lpm entered the reaction chamber. The laser beam ablated the rod, and the synthesized particles were collected onto filters placed between the reaction chamber and the vacuum pump. The graphitic particles with a uniform size of about 80 nm were produced at a rate of around 10 g h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192</span></sup></a> Note that the use of a high-power CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser enabled much higher production rates than is typical for laser ablation.

To synthesize intrinsic SWCNHs, the target was a graphite rod, as used previously, and the process was conducted under argon. Use of nitrogen as the buffer gas produced nitrogen-doped SWCNHs from the same target. They followed the same strategy for boron-doped and boron- and nitrogen- co-doped SWCNHs using a target containing 2 at% boron. In this case, they obtained spherical SWCNH aggregates dominantly containing graphite-like thin sheets, at a rate of 300 mg min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

These dopant atoms were present as three-fold coordinated (sp<small><sup>2</sup></small> bonded) centers in the SWCNHs. The preferential formation of graphite-like thin sheets under argon atmosphere led them to conclude that boron facilitated the formation of these sheets. Based on these results, the authors proposed that large-scale production of these SWCNHs is possible and that practical synthesis of boron-doped and boron- and nitrogen- codoped SWCNTs at ambient temperature and pressure under argon and nitrogen could reduce production cost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit196"><sup><span class="sup_ref">196</span></sup></a></p>

Note that synthesis of silicon nanowires using iron catalyst happened at temperatures above 1150 °C.

They achieved a growth rate of 10 to 80 μm/h by high-temperature laser-ablation of a target prepared by pressing silicon powder mixed with 0.5% iron. The energy source was an excimer laser at 248 nm emitting 400 mJ per pulse with a pulse-width of 34 ns and a frequency of 10 Hz. They used argon as the carrier gas at 50 sccm and 500 Torr in a quartz tube furnace at 1200 °C.

Thereafter, the nanorods were ligand-coated by evaporated acetonitrile, delivered in argon at 50 °C. Finally, the ligand-coated nanorods were collected in a liquid-nitrogen cold trap such that they were dispersed in the excess acetonitrile upon melting. Subsequent evaporation of the solvent yielded molybdenum oxide nanorods with a length of 100 nm, diameter of 20 nm and a narrow size distribution, as a blue powder. The semiamorphous nanorods crystallized upon annealing, but the as-produced nanorods exhibited higher activity as photocatalysts for the degradation of methylene blue. The pulsed laser ablated nanorods were smaller and accordingly more reactive compared to nanorods produced by other techniques.

            <span>Bulgakova and Bulgakov synthesized graphite, Nb, and YBCO using a pulsed laser ablation technique.

The targets were polycrystalline graphite, pure Nb, and YBCO superconductor. Based on evidence for the transition from normal evaporation to phase explosion, they found that the ablation rate substantially increased for graphite, Nb, and YCBO targets at 22, 15, and 17.5 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> as the threshold fluences, respectively, corresponding to the transition from normal vaporization to phase explosion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit202"><sup><span class="sup_ref">202</span></sup></a></span>
            <p class="otherpara">Stoian <span class="italic">et al.</span> considered a process called “Coulomb explosion” (CE) as the mechanism of ablation during low fluence ultrashort pulse laser ablation, providing important insight in to ablation mechanisms. CE is a process in which a particle or insulating surface becomes so highly charged that repulsive Coulomb forces are stronger than the cohesive forces holding the material together, and it spontaneously explodes. The energy source for this study was a Ti:Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> oscillator-amplifier laser generating 800 nm light with a pulse duration as low as 0.1 ps. They ablated the target in a UHV chamber at a pressure of 1 mPa using pulse energy densities of 5 and 4 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> for durations of 0.1 and 0.2 ps, respectively, which were slightly higher than the single-shot ablation threshold. They considered two different regimes for ablation: “gentle” and “strong”. In the first one, the ablation rate is low and just a few monolayers are vaporized by each laser shot. In the “strong” regime, the ablation rate per pulse was an order of magnitude greater and “phase explosion” characteristics were observed that were qualitatively different from the ablation by nanosecond UV laser pulses. They found that ablation in the “gentle” regime led to equal ion momenta due to impulsive CE from the surface region lasting about 1 ps while ablation in the “strong” regime, which is associated with strong plasma optical emission and crater generation, led to equal kinetic energies of ions instead of equal ion momenta.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit204"><sup><span class="sup_ref">204</span></sup></a> While this study did not focus on the particle formation aspects, it was important in proving mechanistic insights into different ablation regimes for ultrafast laser ablation.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Material removal and particle formation in laser ablation is largely determined by an energy balance.

The experimental data on the ablated mass was the key validation point for the model, in which plasma absorption was an important factor at high laser fluence. Notably, heat conduction in the target was considerable at low laser fluences. Moreover, they found that the laser fluence played a critical role in determining the maximum melt depth for conditions below the ablation threshold. Furthermore, they estimated the possible thermodynamic critical temperatures (related to the maximum temperature reached before the transition from normal ablation to phase explosion) using the refined thermal model.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit244"><sup><span class="sup_ref">244</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Lutey developed a precise laser ablation model based upon one-dimensional heat flow with consideration of temperature dependent material properties and thorough optical propagation. He employed established matrix methods for electromagnetic plane wave propagation in multi-layered media for the numerical optical calculation for the absorption of the laser beam in the target. To consider the effects of reflection from the dielectric-metal interface and the incident laser beam absorption by the products of ablation, he defined a simulated shielding coefficient which allowed him to obtain good agreement between the model predictions and experiments for the ablation of aluminum, in terms of both ablation threshold and melted depth. In addition, he studied the influences of pulse duration, laser wavelength, and target thickness on the aluminum ablation threshold. He found that increasing the pulse duration and the laser wavelength raised the phase explosion threshold, while increasing the sample thickness below 1.5 μm lowered the threshold. Thermal energy transport, optical absorption, and thermal saturation were responsible for the effects of pulse duration, laser wavelength, and sample thickness, respectively. Based on these observations, he concluded that both sample and laser characteristics affected the threshold, due to the significant role of thermal energy penetration into the target during the ablation process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a></p>

        <span>The energy required to drive evaporation or initiate chemical reaction to achieve a state of supersaturation that leads to particle nucleation can be delivered directly into the gas phase using a plasma. Solid, liquid, or vapor precursors can be injected into, or just downstream of, a plasma. In many cases, the droplets or particles injected must be very small to evaporate completely within a short residence time in the plasma or hot post-plasma gases. Plasma processing methods are conveniently divided into two general categories based on the local temperature equilibrium between electrons and ionized gas: thermal plasma processing, in which the electrons and ionized gas reach the same high temperature, and non-thermal plasma processing, in which the electrons have an effective temperature much higher than ions and neutral molecules in the plasma.</span>

          <span>In thermal plasma, the electrons and ionized gas are at the same temperature. The rate of intermolecular collisions in the ionized gas is sufficient to maintain local temperature equilibrium. Thermal plasmas are produced by passing an electric current through an ionized gas at high enough pressure to maintain the needed collision rate for thermal equilibration. Two main types of thermal plasma discharges are DC arc jets and high frequency (microwave or radio frequency) induction plasmas. The range of operating temperature in these systems is broad: from 300 °C to the order of 10<small><sup>4</sup></small> °C. In DC arc jets, the source of current for plasma discharge is physical contact with a metallic electrode surface. Although the system is simple and inexpensive, the electrodes may contaminate the product. In high-frequency induction systems, there is no contact between the plasma and its power source. Accordingly, contamination from electrodes and reactor walls can be avoided. Plasma composition (most commonly with argon as the primary component) and frequency (between 200 kHz and 20 MHz) are controllable variables. Because the typical temperature can be on the order of 10<small><sup>4</sup></small> °C, materials with high melting points and solid powder feeds can vaporized.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27,29,175,248,249</span></sup></a> Use of inexpensive powder feed, rapid cooling rate, and demonstrated scale-up are advantages of thermal plasma processing.

Iron required the high-temperature provided by the plasma for evaporation, but could still be considered to undergo an evaporation-condensation process rather than more complex processes involving decomposition of molecular precursors and conversion into a product of different composition. A schematic of their plasma production system is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29</a>. They used a nominally 20 kW power supply to generate a RF current of 63 A at 2.9 MHz that led to inductive heating of the atmospheric-pressure plasma at a typical power of 4.5 kW. They introduced argon as the plasma gas at 28 lpm through a 45° oriented injection tube with 36 evenly spaced holes at the top of the plasma tube, which was advantageous to stabilize the plasma. They introduced 5 to 9 μm iron powder at a rate of 0.26 to 3.6 mg s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and delivered it in 3 to 4 lpm of argon. They reported that the location of the injection tube outlet with respect to the induction coil was important, because the characteristic recirculation vortex of the RF plasma was disrupted when the position was too high, but full vaporization of the precursor was not achieved if the position was too low. Accordingly, the best position for the injection tube outlet was at the midplane of the induction coil. Following the plasma discharge, they used a 64 mm inner diameter by ∼1 m long double-walled stainless-steel tube with a porous inner wall through which argon gas entered to cool the gas and reduce wall deposition of particles. Thus, the micron-size precursor particles first evaporated in the thermal plasma and then iron NPs nucleated homogenously as the gas was cooled in the porous tube downstream. This approach allowed them to produce spherical non-agglomerated iron NPs with average sizes in the range of 20 to 70 nm (increasing with increasing precursor feed rate). In addition, they developed a two-dimensional numerical model to predict the heating and evaporation rate of the injected precursor, nucleation and growth of the NPs, temperature and velocity distributions, and particle transport by convection, diffusion, and thermophoresis. They successfully predicted the average particle sizes, although the size distribution and the particle concentration profiles were not perfectly reproduced. This combination of thermal plasma synthesis with detailed product particle characterization using aerosol instrumentation and with aerosol dynamics modelling was a major advance in thermal plasma synthesis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a></span>

Two vertically arranged graphite electrodes produced an extended arc plasma with the 15 kW DC power. Argon entered through a narrow hole in the upper electrode.

The smaller particles in the precursor mixture were vaporized in-flight as in a non-transferred arc mode of operation. Subsequent chemical reactions initiated particle nucleation and growth. Larger particles that were not fully vaporized during transport through the plasma accumulated in a crucible where they effectively became part of the electrode and were vaporized in a transferred arc mode that typically uses one or both electrodes as the particle precursor.

A schematic of this DC torch and nozzle configuration is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig32">Fig. 32</a>. Their plasma reactor was a water-cooled vacuum chamber including a reactant injection system (25 mm long by 15 mm diameter, placed immediately downstream of the nozzle), a plasma torch (Miller SG-1B plasma gun), and a converging nozzle (50 mm long with an inlet inner diameter of 10 mm, outlet inner diameter of 5 mm placed on the top flange of the chamber).

Notably, they measured the temperatures using thermocouples at the inlet and outlet of each component of the reactor to quantify heat losses from the plasma to each component.

            <p class="otherpara">Li and Ishigaki employed thermal plasma processing to produce titania nanocrystals with an average size in the range of 10 to 50 nm. They used titanium carbide (TiC) powder microparticles as the titanium precursor. A schematic of their reactor is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig34">Fig. 34</a>. The plasma reactor consisted of a stainless-steel cylinder with an inner diameter of 250 mm with a conical exit section. It was held at a pressure of 53 to 80 kPa. A 2 MHz induction-plasma torch was employed at powers from 25 to 40 kW. The titanium precursor was injected at 1.6 to 1.8 g min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> from the top of the plasma torch into the center of the plasma region, carried by Ar or an Ar/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixture at flow rates from 2.5 to 10 lpm. They used three different sheath gas mixtures: Ar–O<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Ar–He, and Ar–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>. In some cases, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> was also added downstream of the plasma torch. When no O<small><sub>2</sub></small> was added, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the carrier gas provided oxygen to the system. When the Ar–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixture was used as sheath gas, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> not only served as the oxidizing agent to produce titania NPs, but also increased the thermal conductivity of the gas mixture, enhancing heat transfer. The oxygen flow rate was variable from 2.5 to 20 lpm in the 90 lpm total gas flow to the system. This process produced a mixture of hexagonal rutile and spherical anatase crystals with an average size of 20 to 50 nm. They found that changing the oxygen flow rate at fixed total flow rate of the gaseous mixture led to a change in the anatase content from 20 to 75 wt%. In addition, they reported that rapid cooling had greater effect than introducing oxygen into the coagulated particles to synthesize oxygen-deficient rutile. Also, they adjusted the flow rate of the carrier gas to control the phase composition and they could synthesize NPs with above 90 wt% rutile content by increasing the flow rate of the carrier gas. For experiments with Ar–He sheath gas, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> was injected at the tail part of the Ar–He plasma. Addition of He dramatically increased thermal conductivity of the plasma. This produced a dramatic decrease in the size of titania clusters and change in phase composition due to the very short oxidizing reaction time at the tail of the plasma. They concluded that cluster size could be controlled precisely by introducing the oxygen stream in various part of the plasma. For the Ar–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>–CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> plasma, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at a flow rate of 0.5 lpm mixed with 4.5 or 9.5 lpm Ar served as the carrier gas, while H<small><sub>2</sub></small> was added to the sheath gas. Among the plasma gas mixtures tested, the mixture of Ar and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> had the highest thermal conductivity. At temperatures above 5000 K, decomposition of carbon dioxide produced oxygen and carbon monoxide. This composition required a higher plasma operating power of 40 kW due to higher heat dissipation by this plasma. This plasma produced pure rutile titania NPs. Overall, this work showed that a thermal plasma oxidation process can effectively control both the size and the crystalline phase content of titania nanocrystals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit290"><sup><span class="sup_ref">290</span></sup></a></p>

In addition, they introduced oxygen at a flow rate of 1.5 lpm to ensure oxidation. They found that increasing the amount of dopant decreased the size of the NPs.

Although they observed three populations of particles, the particles mostly had a spherical morphology with an average size in the range of 150 to 200 nm. They suggested that the particle size and structure resulted from internal mixing phenomena within the reactor. Recirculation of particles through the hot plasma region led to graphitization of initially amorphous carbon, while extended residence time associated with recirculation allowed particle growth.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> This group used the same set-up for synthesis of two different morphologies of carbon nanomaterials: carbon nanotubes with a “stacked-cup” structure and carbon nano-necklace structures formed by the repetition of multi-walled carbon spheres in a bell-like structure with encapsulated metal particles. These two different morphologies are exhibited in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig36">Fig. 36</a>. In this case, carbon black coated with 3% Ni and Co was injected into the thermal plasma. After total vaporization in the plasma, catalyst (Ni and Co) particles nucleated first, then carbon structures grew over them before the plasma gas and the precursor mixture were quenched and the final products were extracted. The key advantage of this process compared to the conventional arc and laser processes was that the flow rate of solid carbon was not limited by the rate of electrode erosion and could be independently controlled along with the flow rates of plasma gas and metal catalysts. They used helium and nitrogen as the plasma gases and they found that the nature of the plasma gas affected the morphology of the NPs. The temperature of the reactor (wall temperature) was in the range of 1000 to 1300 °C (the metal catalyst was in the solid state in this range) using helium as the plasma gas, which led to carbon nanotubes while it was in the range of 1700 to 2400 °C (the metal catalyst was liquid in this range) using nitrogen as the plasma gas, which led to carbon nano-necklaces.

Their set-up (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig37">Fig. 37a</a>) included three parts: (a) a reaction chamber with a powder feeder through which carbon black of three different grades (M120, M280, and M880) with binary and ternary catalysts such as Ni/Co (0.6/0.6 at%), Ni/Co/CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (0.6/0.6/0.2 at%), and Ni/Co/Y<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> (0.6/0.6/0.4 at%), were delivered in Ar to the center of a plasma torch driven by a 60 kW power supply at 3 MHz. Delivery to the center of the plasma torch exposes the precursors to much higher temperature than that of the plasma jet (about 9000 K instead of below 7000 K). The plasma gas was argon, although other inert gases like He or hydrocarbon species like C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> could also be used. A laminar flow of sheath gas was used to confine the plasma. To investigate the effect of the thermodynamic properties of the plasma gas mixture on the synthesis process, they employed two types of sheath gas, He and Ar/He mixture. Upon leaving the plasma, gases entered a double-walled cylindrical tube containing interchangeable graphite inserts that facilitated flexible control of cooling rate and temperature gradient, which play a key role in the synthesis of SWCNT. This was followed by a quenching chamber including two double-walled cylindrical sections for rapid cooling by the injection of additional inert gas and to initiate oxidation reactions to remove impurities using various oxidizing agents. Finally, a particle collection system including a filtration unit with three porous ceramic elements was used to collect the solid products and a heat exchanger cooled the residual gases before they were exhausted through a vacuum pump. With this large-scale process, they produced carbon soot containing ∼40 wt% SWCNT like those shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig37">Fig. 37b–d</a>. The plasma composition, grade of carbon black precursor, and type of catalyst each affected the quality and the purity of the SWCNT.

Accordingly, they reported that the optimum molar ratio of hydrogen to the tantalum precursor was about 25 which produced powder with 97.4 wt% TaC.

The plasma and carrier gas were nitrogen. They used hexagonal boron nitride powder or amorphous boron powder as the precursor and found that the latter gave higher conversion to BN NPs. At atmospheric pressure of nitrogen, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) formed and substantial boron remained unreacted. In that case, boron nitrides formed with a “nanococoon” morphology, comprising a shell of boron nitride around boron particles. With increasing nitrogen pressure, the morphology changed from nanococoon to nanotube so that between 2 and 3 atm the amount of the nanocoons diminished, and above 3 atm, nanococoons could barely be observed. The different morphologies are shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39</a>.

Argon and nitrogen were mixed at a flow rate of 14 lpm each as the plasma gas. Tungsten powder with a typical size of 1 μm was used as the tungsten source, which they combined with three different carbon sources: MWCNT with a diameter of 10 nm, amorphous carbon with a size of 6 μm, and methane.

Each torch was run at a power of 6.9 to 7.5 kW, at a 100 A constant current. The precursor was delivered from the top of the triple torch into the plasma, at a rate of 0.5 to 0.6 g min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, in 5 lpm argon. This produced multi-walled (maximum 5 walls) BNNTs with an average diameter of around 7 nm and high crystallinity. Using the triple torch configuration, the plasma flame length reached 30 cm. Accordingly, the high temperature region was larger than that of conventional configurations. The triple torch configuration allowed direct injection of the precursors into the core of the plasma, increasing the BNNT productivity by avoiding precursor flow into the edges of the plasma flame as occurs in a single torch configuration, because of the high velocity and viscosity of the central plasma flame. In addition, they employed numerical analysis of flow in the system and thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to elucidate the role of hydrogen in the nanotubes’ growth. They found that adding hydrogen led to the formation of NH, NH<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and N<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which delayed the recombination of nitrogen into N<small><sub>2</sub></small>. B–H species were also generated, leading to B–N–H intermediates. The dehydrogenation of these intermediates with early boron nucleation in the quenching process led to the growth of BNNTs. In addition, the high thermal conductivity of hydrogen expanded the high temperature and high enthalpy zones that, along with the expansion of the vortex region, provided longer residence times of the B–N–H intermediates in the reaction zone. Ultimately, they produced 12.6 g h<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of BNNTs at a power of 21.4 kW, which shows promise for economical production of BNNTs at industrial scale.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260</span></sup></a></p>

First, they derived a nondimensional form of the aerosol general dynamic equation, with appropriate simplifying assumptions, and solved it numerically. A key assumption was that in such a thermal plasma, the nucleated particles can be treated as electrically neutral, because most particle growth occurs after the gas has cooled to a temperature where ionization fractions, at thermal equilibrium, are small. They then used experimental data for the thermal plasma processing of Fe NPs to produce a dimensional form of the equation and its predictions. They also applied their model to SiC NPs. Their model predicted that reactant concentration and cooling rate (which determined the effective residence time for particle nucleation and growth) were the key factors controlling primary particle size, with increasing reactant concentration and decreasing cooling rate leading to larger primary particle size. They also noted that thermophoresis, electric charge effects, London-van der Waals forces, and diffusion across concentration gradients could all be additional factors affecting the collision rate in thermal plasma processing, but were not accounted for in their simplified model.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit327"><sup><span class="sup_ref">327</span></sup></a> More recent studies have gone on to relax many of these assumptions. Girshick and Chiu performed another modelling study for the thermal plasma processing of iron NPs that relaxed the assumption of irreversible coagulation of all clusters, down to single atoms, but instead included evaporation from small clusters. They explicitly incorporated evaporation and coagulation terms in a set of cluster-balance rate equations for these small clusters. They retained other simplifying assumptions such as one-dimensional flow field, completion of any relevant chemistry prior to homogeneous nucleation, and the condensation of a single species. This provided a more realistic description of the homogeneous nucleation event, which was found to be the main factor influencing the final size distribution of primary particles. The homogeneous nucleation occurs very quickly in thermal plasma processing, which leads to abrupt generation of stable clusters and particles, followed by Brownian coagulation. Furthermore, they found that the number concentration of the NPs, in addition to the size of NPs, is strongly dependent upon the cooling rate in the reaction zone and concentration of the reactants. Again, increasing precursor concentration and decreasing cooling rate led to production of fewer, but larger NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit328"><sup><span class="sup_ref">328</span></sup></a> While these overall trends mirror intuitive, qualitative expectations, these modelling efforts represent a key step toward more quantitative understanding of the magnitude of each effect.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Ananthapadmanabhan <span class="italic">et al.</span> employed thermal plasma processing of aluminium metal in an oxygen atmosphere to synthesize γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> rather than more stable α-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> NPs, which was possible because of the highly-non-equilibrium nature of the process. Indeed, the high temperature of the reaction zone along with the highly-exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction led to the breakdown of the alumina NPs into aluminium and oxygen species which recombined in the cooler zones to generate γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> NPs with diameters of up to 30 nm. For sufficiently small Al precursor particles, complete oxidation and evaporation led to production of only nanosized γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> by gas-to-particle routes, but for larger precursor particles or lower plasma power, evaporation was incomplete. To understand this effect, they developed a numerical one-dimensional model of aluminum particle melting, oxidation, and evaporation that included the oxidation enthalpy of reaction in the energy balance, along with enthalpies of phase transitions and a phenomenological model of heat transfer to the particles. This model provided fair agreement with experimental observations of complete <span class="italic">vs.</span> incomplete conversion of aluminum precursor microparticles into γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit329"><sup><span class="sup_ref">329</span></sup></a> Note that this modelling effort focuses on an entirely different part of the process compared to that of Girshick and co-workers discussed previously. When solid feed particles are large or form a thermally-stable phase (like alumina), achieving complete precursor evaporation can be a significant barrier. In other cases, like those considered by Girshick, complete precursor dissociation into atoms can safely be assumed. Modelling of systems where these processes overlap, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> where new particles nucleate before all precursors have evaporated or dissociated, is an even greater challenge.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Shigeta and Watanabe developed a numerical growth model for thermal plasma processing of binary alloy NPs that considered the two-dimensional particle size and composition distribution of the product particles. The claimed advantages of their model included its simplicity and associated straightforward numerical solution algorithm. They discretized the particle size and composition distribution with 41 uniformly-spaced compositions and 54 logarithmically-spaced sizes. They took the smallest particle size to be a cluster of 10 atoms. Mass-conserving algorithms were adopted for treating growth by condensation and coagulation, which transfer particles between the discrete size-composition nodes. They employed a binary homogeneous nucleation model based on the work of Wyslouzil and Wilemski.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit330"><sup><span class="sup_ref">330</span></sup></a> Their heterogeneous condensation model considered cluster-size- and composition-dependent vapor pressures of small molten droplets, but required assumptions for unknown activity coefficients in the liquid and accommodation coefficients for atom-droplet collisions due to lack of data. Their treatment of Brownian coagulation spanned the full range of Knudsen numbers. Primary particle growth was considered to be complete when a particle size- and composition-dependent freezing point temperature was reached. They investigated metal-silicon systems as case studies. Employing the two-dimensional model, they were effectively able to simulate the simultaneous and collective combined processes of binary homogeneous nucleation, binary heterogeneous cocondensation, and coagulation of the clusters to understand the growth mechanisms of binary molybdenum-silicon and titanium-silicon systems based upon particle size-composition distributions. Furthermore, they understood that the growth behaviors and mature states in the binary nanoalloy systems were significantly influenced by the saturation pressures of the materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit331"><sup><span class="sup_ref">331</span></sup></a> This group used the same modelling framework in conjunction with an experimental study of the synthesis of TiB<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs with an RF induction thermal plasma.

Decreasing the feed rate of precursor mixture and increasing the ratio of boron to titanium resulted in ideal conditions for the formation of TiB<small><sub>2</sub></small> due to enhancement of the evaporated and nucleated boron molar ratio in the thermal plasma. Moreover, they found based upon the agreement between the experimental and modelling results that a decrease in the feed rate along with a decrease in the titanium concentration in the precursor mixture decreased the size of NPs because of the increase in the number concentration of boron nuclei. They concluded that thermal plasma processing is an effective technique to synthesize compound NPs in which a large difference in the saturation pressure of the elements would otherwise cause severe difficulties in controlling the cocondensation process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit332"><sup><span class="sup_ref">332</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Shigeta applied a computational model appropriate for thermal plasma driven turbulent flows and sharp NP concentration distribution gradients to develop a three-dimensional time-dependent growth-transport model for the synthesis of nanomaterials by thermal plasma processing. His large-eddy-simulation (LES) of the turbulent flow included Joule heating and the Lorentz force. The subgrid-scale models considered both laminar and turbulent states because of their co-existence across the wide range of density and transport properties encountered in thermal plasma processing. His particle nucleation and growth model considered only concentration and average particle size at a given point (in space and time) within the reactor. Thus, its predictions are spatiotemporal profiles of mean particle size and particle concentration (of spherical particles) along with temperature and velocity. With this approach, three-dimensional distributions of the average size and the number density of the NPs were obtained at a manageable computational cost. Silicon was considered as a case study. He found that multiscale vortices were created by an argon thermal plasma jet even far from the plasma torch outlet. Low-temperature thin vortex rings in the upstream region surrounded the high-temperature thicker vortex rings with a double-layer structure. As they moved downstream, the thinner vortex rings transformed into smaller vortices, while the thicker vortex rings deformed. Moreover, he observed that the NPs were formed at the edge of the thermal plasma and that regions with lower number concentration of the NPs contained larger NPs, consistent with coagulation as the main growth mechanism of the NPs. Furthermore, he found that a longer and straighter thermal plasma jet was produced by applying a uniform magnetic field in the axial direction, due to the Lorentz force and Joule heating. This field also prevented turbulent diffusion of silicon vapor and NPs through vortices, which produced larger NPs around the thermal plasma. Based on cross-correlation analysis, he found the temperature fluctuation at the upstream plasma edge was a key factor controlling the NP size and concentration distribution far from the plasma jet.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit333"><sup><span class="sup_ref">333</span></sup></a> Shigata applied the same general approach to DC thermal plasma processing as well, without the Lorenz force and Joule heating, again showing complex spatiotemporal distributions of particle formation.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit334"><sup><span class="sup_ref">334,335</span></sup></a> Overall, these studies paint a much more complex picture of particle production from thermal plasmas than had generally been assumed in earlier 1- and 2-dimensional steady-state models, like those discussed above.

            <p class="otherpara">Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span> performed numerical modelling along with <span class="italic">in situ</span> optical emission spectroscopy to investigate the role of hydrogen in the thermal plasma processing of hexagonal boron nitride powder to synthesize BNNTs. They found that hydrogen affected both chemical and physical pathways to enhance the rapid growth of BNNTs. The modelling studies revealed that the high thermal conductivity of hydrogen facilitated complete vaporization and rapid cooling of the precursor, leading to earlier formation of nanosized boron aerosol droplets to grow BNNTs. They predicted quenching rates of around 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> K s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the initial cooling to the boron nucleation temperature of around 4200 K. Moreover, the release of the heat of reaction of hydrogen atom recombination, starting at about 3800 K helped to maintain the temperature of the plasma gas above the boron solidification temperature of around 2300 K. This longer residence time between boron droplet nucleation and solidification extended the active growth zone of BNNTs further downstream in the plasma reactor. Based on optical emission spectroscopy results, they observed that using hydrogen favored the formation of BH and NH radicals, by reactions involving H radicals, which slowed the formation of N<small><sub>2</sub></small> or N<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> species and stabilized B or N radicals, which facilitated the formation of BN.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit262"><sup><span class="sup_ref">262</span></sup></a> Although this study did not explicitly model the BNNT growth process, the insights provided by the simulation of the flow and temperature fields proved extremely valuable in understanding the role of hydrogen in promoting BNNT growth.

            <p class="otherpara">Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span> performed a simulation and experimental study on thermal plasma processing using a triple DC plasma torch to synthesize NPs. They analyzed the thermal plasma characteristics inside the reactor for plasma-forming gas compositions of Ar, Ar–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and Ar–N<small><sub>2</sub></small> with different carrier gases (Ar, He, and N<small><sub>2</sub></small>) for introducing the precursor powder along the reactor centerline between the three torches. They found that adding nitrogen or hydrogen, with relatively high thermal conductivity, to argon enhanced heat transfer which expanded the region of high temperature to better vaporize the precursor. Among these two highly-thermally-conductive gases, adding nitrogen resulted longer residence time in the zones with a temperature higher than the vaporization temperatures of the tungsten powder and carbon nanotube precursors, which explained observed improvement in the vaporization degree using Ar–N<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixtures. Compared to H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, adding N<small><sub>2</sub></small> provided both a higher initial temperature and faster cooling rate. Both cooled to about 3000 K at the same point in the reactor, and beyond that point the temperature with H<small><sub>2</sub></small> was higher. The effect of the carrier gas was relatively small, simply because its flow rate was much smaller than the gas flow rates through the plasma torches. Nonetheless, He, with high thermal conductivity, produced the smallest cold region near the point of injection of the precursor powder in carrier gas, because of its high thermal conductivity. This could result in somewhat improved vaporization. In general, they concluded that tuning the plasma gas concentration can enable processing of target materials with appropriate residence time in a specific temperature zone, and this control of the thermal environment can improve process performance for achieving desired materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit336"><sup><span class="sup_ref">336</span></sup></a></p>

          <span>In a non-thermal plasma, the temperature of electrons (typically 20<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 to 50<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 K) is much higher than that of the ionized gas (near ambient temperature). A non-thermal plasma can be generated by application of an electric field to a low-pressure gas in short pulses or at high frequency, such that electrons respond to the time-dependent field, but do not efficiently transfer energy to atoms and ions. Accordingly, electrons and the ionized gas do not achieve local temperature equilibrium.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36,175,249,337</span></sup></a> This method enables synthesis of high melting point materials, even though the process gas remains relatively cool, because nanomaterials are heated by surface reactions. This method, unlike other aerosol methods, can limit agglomeration because the synthesized nanomaterials typically acquire a negative charge and thus repel one another. This can lead to narrow size distribution and the synthesis of very small nanomaterials with sizes between 2 and 10 nm. The negatively charged walls of plasma reactors also confine the nanomaterials, reducing losses to the reactor walls. This method is suitable for efficient doping during nanomaterial growth because of the irreversible, far-from-equilibrium nature of particle growth.

A mixture of Ar as the plasma gas and silane (SiH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) as the source of silicon flowed through this tube at pressures of 0.186 to 1.86 kPa. A matching network provided an RF power of 200 W at a frequency of 27.12 MHz to two copper ring electrodes, with up to 30 W actually coupled to the plasma. They divided the plasma in their set-up to two regimes: (a) an intense plasma regime in the region between the electrodes and the vacuum chamber placed 1 inch downstream of the electrodes, and (b) a dimmer plasma regime between the electrodes and the gas inlet. By considering the length of 1 in as the effective plasma zone they derived residence times for flow rates from 12 to 60 sccm ranging from 1.4 to 7.0 ms. They flowed silane as the precursor at flow rates from 0.4 to 2.4 sccm. The electron impact dissociation of silane and subsequent fragment clustering produced crystalline silicon NPs. They collected the NPs on fine stainless-steel meshes placed 1 inch downstream from the plasma region, or on the walls of liquid-nitrogen-cooled quartz tubes. Their set-up provided a unique plasma environment that prevented agglomeration of ultrafine luminescent silicon NPs with average sizes in the range of 2 to 8 nm and a yield of 14 to 52 mg h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

A plasma generated at a higher RF frequency of 70 MHz was used to decompose the precursor. The gaseous precursor mixture included 2.4% silicon tetrachloride (SiCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>) as the silicon precursor, 5 to 70% hydrogen as a chlorine scavenger and Ar as the plasma gas. The total flow rate of the gaseous mixture was varied from 20 to 368 sccm. The total pressure of the plasma reactor ranged from 1 to 12 torr. They found that the input power and the reactor conditions were the main factors affecting the crystallinity of the synthesized NPs. Higher total pressures in the reactor and higher hydrogen concentrations were necessary for higher power in the system, which led to the synthesis of crystalline NPs. Otherwise, the NPs were amorphous. The size of NPs depended on the residence time of the gaseous mixture in the plasma and ranged from 3 to 15 nm. Hydrogen and chlorine were both present on the surface of the silicon nanocrystals which made them more susceptible to oxidation than silicon NPs terminated only by hydrogen. Moreover, the synthesized silicon nanocrystals exhibited photoluminescence with a peak emission wavelength tunable from around 650 to 900 nm and a profile that was almost Gaussian.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit346"><sup><span class="sup_ref">346</span></sup></a></p>

In addition, as reported earlier, the synthesis of NPs using SiCl<small><sub>4</sub></small> as the precursor required an additional flow of hydrogen to scavenge the chlorine from the precursor and led to mixed termination of the NPs with hydrogen and chlorine which increased susceptibility to oxidation.

Large effective spectral separation between the luminescence and optical absorption of the silicon quantum dots eliminated optical losses due to reabsorption of the guided luminescence.

Their plasma reactor (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig43">Fig. 43a</a>) consisted of two stages, each with a non-thermal plasma generated by a 13.56 MHz power supply. The first stage employed a quartz tube with an outer diameter of 2.54 cm at a pressure of about 800 Pa, through which 100 sccm of a mixture of 1.37% silane in argon flowed. A copper ring served as the powered electrode placed 7 cm from the downstream grounded metal flange to which the non-thermal plasma was coupled. The second stage comprised another quartz tube with an outer diameter of 2.54 cm at a pressure of about 130 Pa in which a coil electrode produced the second non-thermal plasma with a length of around 25 cm. The two stages were separated by a metal flange and an orifice with a diameter of 1 mm at its center. Immediately downstream of this orifice, methane as the carbon source at a flow rate of 5 sccm was introduced into the reactor. The second non-thermal plasma was optically found to be coupled to the metal separating the two stages. Accordingly, the nucleated silicon NPs in the first stage were accelerated through the separating orifice and the carbonization occurred immediately upon introduction into the second reactor. The collection filter was a metal mesh located downstream of the plasma volume. The power in the first stage was fixed at 100 W and in the second stage was varied from 8 to 40 W. At a power of 12 W, diamond crystalline silicon was produced. The particles (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig43">Fig. 43b</a>) were spherical with a broad size distribution from 10 to 30 nm because of the long residence time of 250 ms in the first stage, as determined by the length of the plasma and the flow velocity. At a power of 20 W, the synthesized nanocrystalline particles were a mixture of silicon and β-SiC. The majority of the particles were hollow, although some spherical particles could be observed (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig43">Fig. 43c</a>). At a power of 30 W, more silicon particles were converted to silicon carbide. Because of the of the reduction in specific surface area and subsequent breakdown in the hollow spherical structure, the hollow particles formed were less regular and there were no spherical particles (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig43">Fig. 43d</a>). At a power of 40 W, there was a complete conversion of silicon particles to silicon carbide.

Overall, control of morphology from hollow to solid was possible by adjusting the process parameters. The spherical geometry of the initial silicon particles along with the expansion of the silicon lattice during carbonization produced hollow structures. In addition, they conducted a theoretical analysis of the diffusion kinetics and found that the fast transport of the carbon into the silicon particle and the subsequent conversion to the β-SiC phase was enabled by significant NP heating <span class="italic">via</span> interaction with the ionized gas.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit354"><sup><span class="sup_ref">354</span></sup></a></p>

A schematic of their set-up is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig45">Fig. 45</a>. First, they added bubblers to deliver a sulfur source and volatile precursors containing Zn, Sn, or Cu. Although gaseous H<small><sub>2</sub></small>S is an attractive sulfur source, its toxicity severely limits its use; nontoxic precursors are preferable in this case. Hence, they used elemental sulfur, a solid with a melting point of 115 °C and substantial vapor pressure that allowed it to be delivered as a vapor from a vessel held at 120–140 °C. In contrast to the conventional bubbling method in which a carrier gas bubbles through the liquid, they flowed Ar over the liquid sulfur surface to avoid clogging of the gas feed lines.

The second modification was addition of optical access to the plasma emission for <span class="italic">in situ</span> optical emission spectroscopy, which required moving collection and pumping systems off the axis of the plasma tube. They found that increasing the flow rate of Ar to the plasma, at a constant precursor feed rate reduced the size of NPs due to the shorter residence time and lower precursor partial pressure. In addition, the sulfur delivery to the plasma, beyond a small minimum amount, did not affect the elemental compositions of the crystalline NPs at a constant vapor feed rate, while this was affected by the feed rate of the metal precursor at constant sulfur feed rate. The overall metal atomic fraction increased with increasing metal precursor vapor feed rate with formation of metal-rich crystal phases.

            <p class="otherpara">Uner and Thimsen developed a reactor and process based on a non-thermal plasma, which they termed“non-equilibrium plasma aerotaxy (NPA)”, to synthesize pure, crystalline, free-standing, and monodispersed gallium nitride NPs with a tunable size from 5 to 45 nm. Their experimental set-up is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig46">Fig. 46</a>. The growth of NPs by a surface-growth mechanism in NPA enabled the synthesis of NPs with high monodispersity, despite some aggregation. Their system comprised three units: the aerosol unit, the plasma unit, and the collection unit. In the aerosol unit, gallium was placed on a filament that was heated resistively by a DC power supply to generate gallium vapor that was carried by an argon flow to the plasma unit. Before introduction to the plasma unit, rapid quenching led to nucleation of gallium aerosol droplets. The gallium particles reacted with nitrogen in the plasma unit to produce gallium nitride. The plasma unit was a flow-through tubular reactor in which a 13.56 MHz, 80 W RF power supply with a matching network generated the plasma. Finally, product particles were collected on a removeable collection filter or deposited on a TEM grid. The residence time could be adjusted from 10 to 100 ms, which affected average particle size and geometric standard deviation. They produced both hollow and photoluminescent solid NPs with emission in the range of 300 to 400 nm. Although large NPs exhibited emission near the bulk band-gap transition wavelength, NPs below 7 nm diameter produced blue-shifted photoluminescence characteristic of quantum confinement.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit370"><sup><span class="sup_ref">370</span></sup></a></p>

            <span>Moreno-Couranjou <span class="italic">et al.</span> synthesized carbon nanomaterials with various typologies through non-thermal plasma processing based on low current-high voltage discharges at atmospheric pressure. This plasma configuration (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig47">Fig. 47a</a>) is quite different from those discussed above. Their set-up included two electrodes, an annular electrode and a high-voltage electrode, between which an electric arc discharge was produced and carried downstream by a gas flow introduced tangentially. This gas was pure Ar or 8% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in Ar. The small annular electrode diameter of 6 mm along with the swirling injection to produce a vortex flow supported an electric arc to the wall. The set-up included a post-discharge zone made of an insulated stainless-steel enclosure or a Pyrex tube for visualization of the plasma. They employed two alternative power sources to produce the low current-high voltage discharges: (a) a high-voltage transformer and an impedance connected in series that allowed working in AC or DC configurations with a maximum power of 4 kW, controlled by adjusting the impedance when the power source was stopped. (b) A source with electronic components to operate as a current source (0 to 1 A) which supplied a maximum breakdown voltage of 5 kV. Acetylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) or ethylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>) was employed as the carbon source which was introduced radially from the side of the annular electrode. They produced two main families of carbon products with different typologies: (a) concentric texture carbon NPs similar to acetylene-type carbon black (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig47">Fig. 47b</a>), furnace-type carbon black (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig47">Fig. 47c</a>), and filled carbon shells with metal NPs (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig47">Fig. 47d</a>).

They investigated the effects of the power, the type of plasma gas, the position of hydrocarbon injection, and the type of precursor on the synthesis process and found that the growth mechanism and nanomaterial type were governed by temperature. High temperatures led to textures of the NPs such as acetylene-type carbon black or crumpled paper sheets with a lateral-type growth mechanism, while low temperatures favoured a contribution of liquid hydrocarbon droplets in the structure of the NPs to yield furnace-type carbon black through a radial-type growth mechanism.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit341"><sup><span class="sup_ref">341</span></sup></a></span>

A mixture of Ar, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small> entered the reactor through the horizontal tube at 65, 1.5, and 2 sccm, respectively.

The vertical tube was used for <span class="italic">in situ</span> FTIR of the gaseous flow containing nucleated carbon clusters and precursor molecules. Based on the FTIR results, they found that increasing the plasma power led to production of carbon NPs with a low degree of hydrogenation and progressive particle incandescence. Carbon particle temperatures exceeded 2000 K at high plasma power. Moreover, they showed that low plasma power (20 W) produced fully amorphous spherical carbon NPs (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig48">Fig. 48b</a>), while high plasma powers (100 W) generated highly-crystalline carbon NPs with well-defined collapsed graphene-like layers (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig48">Fig. 48c</a>). Indeed, the amorphous carbon NPs transformed to highly-graphitic carbonaceous nanomaterials as the plasma power increased. In both cases, the carbon NPs exhibit a narrow particle size distribution. Surprisingly, they observed the size of carbon NPs decreased with increasing power so that the average size was around 12 nm for a power of 20 W, decreasing to around 6 nm at a power of 100 W.

            <span>Kortshagen and Bhandarkar developed a model to investigate NP growth by coagulation in low pressure plasmas. Their model self-consistently described the plasma properties and particle charging, and simulated the evolution of the NP size distribution by solution of the aerosol general dynamic equation. They found that the attraction of oppositely charged NPs enhanced coagulation in non-thermal plasma processing compared to coagulation in neutral aerosols, although the temporal coagulation behavior followed the same power law time dependence in both cases, provided the NP concentration exceeds that of the positive ions in the plasma. Accordingly, they suggested that the density of positive ions is the critical factor for the onset of coagulation. Moreover, they observed that the mechanism of particle charging plays an important role in determining plasma properties, while it is a negligible factor in describing the coagulation dynamics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit387"><sup><span class="sup_ref">387</span></sup></a></span>

They used the available data for the reactions of small molecules to estimate the reaction rates and define the reactions. They performed simulations for typical discharge parameters in a capacitive plasma. They found that the anion-neutral reactions played the main role in the clustering of silicon hydrides. Dehydrogenation and ring formation mainly occurred through electron-induced dissociation, while SiH<small><sub>2</sub></small> radical insertion was a determining factor only in the initial clustering stages, in structures with at most three or four silicon atoms. In addition, they observed that increasing the ion density resulted in faster clustering and more dehydrogenated clusters because of an increase in reactive radical generation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit388"><sup><span class="sup_ref">388</span></sup></a> They also simulated the nucleation and growth of NPs in argon–silane plasmas by developing a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the particle nucleation delay associated with increased gas temperature.

In addition, they proposed that other factors that can affect the diffusion coefficient, like employing a lighter gas such as hydrogen or helium instead of argon, which increases the diffusion coefficient, or increasing the pressure to decrease the importance of diffusion, could affect the nucleation delay.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit389"><sup><span class="sup_ref">389</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">In non-thermal plasma processing, the aerosol particles are distributed among both particle sizes and charge states. However, the majority of dusty (particle-containing) plasma modelling studies treat the particles as monodisperse and all characterized by the same average charge. Agarwal and Girshick developed a sectional model to investigate, in an effective way, the main qualitative features of the time-dependent evolution of both particle size and charge distributions in non-thermal plasma processing such as co-emergence of tiny neutral NPs and larger negatively charged NPs, size and charge distribution effects on coagulation, expansion and structure of the particle cloud, and the nanodusty plasma afterglow dynamics.

Inclusion of chemistry of nucleation and surface growth was a major addition relative to their earlier study. The plasma and precursor gases were a mixture of argon and silane at a ratio of 30 to 1, and two RF voltages of 100 and 250 V were considered. The higher voltage of 250 V produced a plasma discharge with two spatially separated lobes containing mainly negatively-charged large NPs. These were separated by a region of lower particle mass and surface area concentration, in which nucleation occurred. Based upon the simulation results, they found that the nucleation in the region between the lobes resulted from several coupled phenomena such as NP transport, the potential profile of plasma, and the trapping of silicon hydride anions as a driving force for nucleation in the system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit391"><sup><span class="sup_ref">391</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Le Picard and Girshick developed a model to investigate the effects of single-particle charge limits (size- and material-dependent maximum charge that a particle can accommodate) on the stationary NP charge distributions in non-thermal plasma processing. Their analytical model of stationary charge distribution was in good agreement with Monte Carlo charging simulations. They studied the influence of charge limits on the various values of electron-to-ion density ratio and the effect of ion mass on the charge distribution transient behavior, considering charging limits. They reported that a decrease in the charge limit led to a severe decrease in the required time to achieve a steady-state charge distribution. Moreover, they found that high-frequency charge fluctuations were relatively more important factors when the charge limits were accounted for, relative to simulations without charge limits.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit392"><sup><span class="sup_ref">392</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Although there is an overall tendency for the NPs to be charged negatively in non-thermal plasma processing, a minor fraction of the NPs can be neutral and therefore not subject to any electrostatic confinement in the plasma, or can even be positively charged, and thus electrostatically attracted to surfaces bounding the plasma. Mamunuru <span class="italic">et al.</span> performed Monte Carlo simulations to study the effects of various parameters on the non-negatively charged NP fraction of the stationary particle charge distribution in non-thermal plasma processing. They considered two deviations from the orbital motion limited theory of particle charging: electron tunneling that results single-particle charge limits, and increasing ion current to NPs because of charge-exchange collisions inside the NP's capture radius. They found that decreasing the size of the NPs, the electron temperature, or the positive ion temperature, and increasing the pressure or the electronegativity of the particle material were all factors that could increase the non-negatively charged NP fractions. Moreover, they reported that silica, with a low electron affinity of 1.0 eV, exhibited much higher non-negatively charged particle fractions compared to silicon, with a higher electron affinity of 4.05 eV. Notably, they assumed collision attachment of electrons and ions as the main mechanism for the NP charging in non-thermal plasma, while recognizing that additional electron-emissive effects, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> photodetachment or secondary electron emission, could further increase the non-negatively charged NP fractions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit393"><sup><span class="sup_ref">393</span></sup></a></p>

He found that the reaction between the negatively-charged ions trapped electrostatically in the non-thermal plasma and neutral molecules or radicals governed nucleation, while the reactions of the neutral molecules on the surface of negatively-charged NPs were responsible for particle surface growth, and coagulation was dominated by collisions between tiny neutral NPs with negatively-charged NPs. Thus, all three processes are dominated by interaction of a neutral species with a negatively charged one. He noted that induction of an electric dipole or image potential in a neutral molecule or NP by an anion or a negatively-charged NP enhances collision rates that are important for nucleation, particle surface growth, and coagulation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit394"><sup><span class="sup_ref">394</span></sup></a></p>

While the Langmuir probe method is well-developed, its application in dusty plasmas is notoriously difficult. To overcome this challenge, they employed a two-plasma system. They first produced graphitic carbon NPs in an Ar–H<small><sub>2</sub></small> low-pressure plasma. After complete conversion of acetylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) to NPs in the first reactor, they introduced the dust into a second reactor in which they performed Langmuir probe measurements. By doing so, they were able to investigate the effects of various operating parameters on the non-thermal dusty plasma properties in the absence of any nucleation or growth of the NPs, which were not occurring in the second plasma reactor where the measurement was performed. They showed that the presence of the NPs did not interfere with their measurements. Notably, they found that increasing input power did not monotonically increase the charge carried by the NPs. In fact, it unexpectedly decreased at sufficiently high input power levels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit395"><sup><span class="sup_ref">395</span></sup></a> This group employed the same technique to investigate the effects of electron emission from the NPs on the electron energy distribution in non-thermal dusty plasmas. They observed an unexpected broad peak in the EEDF at energies ranging from 2 to 4 V. Based on results of a self-consistent model that was in a good qualitative agreement with the Langmuir probe measurements, they inferred that distributed electron emission from the NPs resulted in the unexpected peak corresponding to the NP floating potential. Based on a NP energy balance analysis employing the measured NP concentration and plasma density, they inferred that hot NPs, which could not cool due to slow heat transfer at low pressure and insufficient radiative losses from tiny NPs, emitted electrons into the non-thermal dusty plasma by field-assisted thermionic emission. This electron emission influenced both the electron energy distribution and charge balance of the NPs in the plasma. They concluded that the plasma ionization balance can be strongly affected by the existence of dust in the non-thermal plasma, to a greater extent than previously expected.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit396"><sup><span class="sup_ref">396</span></sup></a></p>

            <span>Chang, Skandan, Danforth, Kear, and Hahn pioneered the CVC method for synthesis of nanostructured SiC<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>N<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> and ZrO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>C<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>. They started from an inert gas condensation set-up and modified it to use metalorganic precursors. They substituted the energy source in the IGC method with a molybdenum-wound tube furnace with a high-purity alumina tube to decompose the precursors and generate a continuous flow of nanomaterials in a carrier gas. The set-up (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig50">Fig. 50</a>) consisted of two main parts connected by a needle valve: a reaction chamber at a pressure of 1 to 50 mbar and a precursor delivery system at atmospheric pressure. The needle valve controlled the flow rate of the precursor at 8.55 mmol min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in He carrier gas. Upon entering the tube furnace, the precursor decomposed and particles nucleated. The rapid expansion of the aerosol quenched the particle growth and sintering process. Finally, the particles were deposited on a rotating liquid nitrogen-cooled substrate for collection. They found three important factors for successful synthesis of nanomaterials using the method: (a) a low precursor concentration in the carrier gas to minimize the collision frequency between freshly nucleated NPs, (b) rapid expansion of the NP aerosol into an inert gas, and (c) rapid cooling at the outlet of the reactor. For the synthesis of loosely-agglomerated SiC<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>N<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> nanomaterials with an average primary particle size of 2 to 10 nm, they used hexamethyl-disilazane((CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>SiNHSi(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>) as the precursor and controlled the temperature of the tube furnace in the range of 1100 to 1400 °C. Thereafter, they conducted heat treatment on amorphous SiC<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>N<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> in Ar to produce cubic β-SiC nanocrystals with a spherical morphology. Crystallization began at 1200 to 1300 °C and completed at 1400 °C. They employed heating in H<small><sub>2</sub></small> to produce cubic β-SiC nanocrystals with a whisker-like morphology (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig49">Fig. 49a</a>) which formed at 1400 °C, and heating in NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> (1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 mixture) to obtain hexagonal α-Si<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> nanocrystals with a whisker-like morphology. To generate amorphous ZrO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>C<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> nanomaterials with an average size below 10 nm, they used zirconium <span class="italic">tert</span>-butoxide (Zr[OC(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sub>4</sub></small>) as the precursor with the furnace at 500 to 700 °C. They found that the amount of polymeric species in the product decreased with increasing temperature of the tube furnace. They suggested that trapping of volatile species in the particles caused the product to be amorphous. They sintered the nanomaterials in air to yield tetragonal and monoclinic nanostructured ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Crystallization began at around 400 °C and completed at 1225 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit406"><sup><span class="sup_ref">406</span></sup></a> Kear and Strutt follow the same strategy to produce SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, SiC, and Si<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> nanomaterials using different carrier gases, but the same silicon precursor (hexamethyl-disilazane).

The simulation tracked the chemical reaction of precursor, particle nucleation, and subsequent growth, aggregation, and sintering of NPs in addition to the detailed treatment of mass, energy, and momentum transfer.

Using the model, they reasonably calculated the temperature, velocity profile, and particle size distribution within the CVC reactor. They employed a population balance model and phenomenological chemical reaction rates to model the formation and growth of NPs under different operating conditions, including precursor concentrations and total gas flow rate. They used commercial CFD software (Fluent) for their simulations and employed the Quadrature Method of Moments (QMOM) to approximate the population balance (aerosol general dynamics equation). By adjusting the unknown rate constants for particle nucleation and growth, they were able to achieve good agreement with experimental data. In general, their spatial CFD model can be employed to predict the NP size distribution, to optimize the synthesis technique, and to visualize internal flow and reaction behaviors in a CVC process which could result deeper understanding of the process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit463"><sup><span class="sup_ref">463</span></sup></a> In another study, this group performed two-dimensional multiphase CFD simulations to study the CVC process of generating tungsten carbide NPs from tungsten hexachloride (WCl<small><sub>6</sub></small>), methane, and hydrogen.

They regulated the time-temperature profile in the hot-wall reactor with temperatures ranging from 600 °C to 1750 °C using an inductively heated furnace with variable inductor geometry.

            <p class="otherpara">Wergen <span class="italic">et al.</span> synthesized germanium NPs through the thermal decomposition of germane (GeH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) in a hot-wall reactor. They employed an external seeding unit with a hot wire generator using niobium, tantalum, tungsten, or molybdenum as the seeding metal to establish a stable aerosol particle concentration. The hot wire generator produced small particles that served as heterogeneous nuclei and inhibited homogeneous nucleation of Ge particles. This prevented the production of hard agglomerates from those small germanium NPs. Among the seeding metals, tungsten and molybdenum produced the most uniform spherical germanium NPs with narrow size distributions (geometrical standard deviations below 1.1). Moreover, they employed a population balance model coupled with the reactor centerline temperature profile from a CFD simulation. The modelling results were validated by the experimental data and showed that the homogenous nucleation rate decreased with increasing concentration of the seeds. This reduced the total concentration of the NPs in the hot-wall reactor. Thus, the modelling provided key insight into the conditions for which heterogeneous nucleation can be expected to dominate homogeneous nucleation and how that translates into production of relatively monodisperse particles by surface growth rather than polydisperse particles associated with coagulation and sintering.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit470"><sup><span class="sup_ref">470</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">The shape of nickel NPs is a signification factor in determining their performance in various applications. For instance, a cubic shape, which results in exposure of specific crystal facets and enhanced magnetic properties, may be preferable in catalysis and bioseparations applications, while in multilayer ceramic capacitors spherical nickel NPs are preferred because of their high packing density. While aerosol processes most often produce spherical particles, when the particles grow as a solid, rather than a liquid droplet, production of other shapes is possible. Accordingly, Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span> performed theoretical and experimental studies to control the shape of nickel NPs synthesized in a CVC process. Their density functional theory (DFT) modelling study focused on calculating gas adsorption energies and stabilization of Ni (1 0 0) and Ni (1 1 1) surfaces. Either kinetic or thermodynamic stabilization of particular crystal facets can change the shape of the growing NPs. Their modelling results helped to explain the experimental observation that the synthesis of nickel NPs <span class="italic">via</span> reduction of nickel chloride (NiCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>) vapor by hydrogen in a tube furnace with two heating zones can lead to a spherical morphology when the second zone employs a hydrogen atmosphere, while a nickel chloride vapor atmosphere favored the synthesis of nickel NPs with a cubic morphology.

            <p class="otherpara">Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span> used an ultrasonic atomizer with the spray pyrolysis technique to make spherical monodispersed zinc oxide NPs.

A schematic of their experimental set-up is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig57">Fig. 57</a>. The ultrasonic atomizer produced aerosol droplets that were delivered by a mixture of air and nitrogen to a furnace at the low temperature of 200 °C because they wanted a temperature between dehydration temperature (water boiling point) of 100 °C and the decomposition temperature of the precursor solution which was 240 °C. Thus, the aerosol droplets were converted into zinc acetate particles that were delivered to a second furnace at a much higher temperature of approximately 500 °C where they were converted into zinc oxide NPs with a mean primary particle size in the range of 100–200 nm and a specific surface area of around 50 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Dissolving the precursor in alcohol instead of water allowed the synthesis of spherical solid particles rather than hollow shells. They found that the flow rate of carrier gas and the precursor solution concentration strongly influenced the characteristics of the final products. Increasing the flow rate of the carrier gas produced smaller NPs and increasing the precursor solution concentration generated larger quantities of ultrafine zinc oxide NPs.

            <p class="otherpara">Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> employed spray pyrolysis for synthesis of 4 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia nanomaterials. They investigated the effect of the relative solution saturation and the type of precursor on the synthesis process. They used five different zirconium precursors with different decomposition temperatures, including zirconyl hydroxychloride (ZrO(OH)Cl), zirconyl chloride octahydrate (ZrOCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>·8H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), zirconyl nitrate hydrate (ZrO(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·<span class="italic">x</span>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), zirconium acetate (Zr(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>COO)<small><sub>4</sub></small>), and zirconyl hydroxyacetate (ZrO(OH)<small><sub>0.5</sub></small>(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>COO)<small><sub>1.5</sub></small>). The yttrium precursor was yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>·6H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O). A two-fluid atomizer was employed to produce aerosol droplets that were carried into a furnace with overall length of 1.2 m and four separately-heated zones with equal lengths and temperatures of 300, 500, 750, and 750 °C, with the lowest temperature at the furnace inlet side. They could synthesize solid spherical particles with a high degree of homogeneity when the initial relative solution saturation was limited to about 0.01, which allowed them to keep the concentration of salt homogeneous before precipitation, because the droplet volume decreased dramatically before precipitation. Indeed, high solubility of the precursor was not an intrinsically important factor for the synthesis of dense nanomaterials, provided the initial relative solution saturation was low. At higher initial relative saturation, the solubility of the precursor and the oxide content play important roles in the synthesis process. They reported that the best results for the synthesis of zirconia NPs were achieved by decomposition of zirconyl hydroxide and zirconyl chloride.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit493"><sup><span class="sup_ref">493</span></sup></a> Lenggoro <span class="italic">et al.</span> also synthesized zirconia NPs by spray pyrolysis.

The tube furnace was oriented vertically and from the top the zones had temperatures of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. They investigated the effect of various operating parameters on the morphology of the synthesized NPs and found that high reactor temperature, steep temperature gradient, high carrier gas flow rate, and low initial precursor concentration in the solution led to hollow particles; otherwise, solid dense particles could be synthesized.

            <p class="otherpara">Rulison and Flagan synthesized yttria particles from concentrated precursor solutions of about 400 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> using electrospray pyrolysis. In addition to getting higher production rate, using a concentrated precursor solution is advantageous for producing particles of higher purity due to the lower concentration of nonvolatile solvent impurities. They used yttrium nitrate pentahydrate (Y(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>·5H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) or yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>·6H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) dissolved in in 1-propanol (C<small><sub>3</sub></small>H<small><sub>8</sub></small>O) as the precursor. It was injected into a stainless-steel capillary with a diameter of 1.57 mm as the electrode. The electrode was located 8 mm above a stainless-steel plate with a 10 mm diameter hole as the counter-electrode. They applied a potential to the electrode using a high-voltage power supply. A Taylor cone formed at a critical value of potential applied to the electrode. The potential was increased to 1.1–1.5 times the critical potential value to launch and maintain stable electrospraying. They used a SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> gas flow to purge the top part of the atomizer to avoid corona discharge at the Taylor cone. The SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> flow was saturated with 1-propanol to avoid evaporation of the solvent at the cone and the formation of a solute crust. They used a corona needle located beneath the counter-electrode with a high potential opposite to the potential of the electrode to deflect the charged droplets away from the counter-electrode and discharge them. When the corona needle was adjusted such that the net current to ground was negligible (below 10 nA), which produced charge-free aerosol droplets, a maximum throughput efficiency of 50% was achieved. The aerosol droplets were delivered by air as the carrier gas to an alumina tube with an inner diameter of 56 mm and length of 1.5 m in an electric furnace to be pyrolyzed. The temperature of the furnace was 550 °C and the residence time in the reaction zone was about 5.7 s.

The average size of the synthesized particles was in the range of 170–290 nm. The type of precursor played a substantial role in controlling the particle morphology. Using yttrium nitrate pentahydrate as the precursor produced particles with a dense spheroidal morphology due to formation of a particle surface that was permeable to alcohol vapor, while a hollow inflated spherical morphology was produced when yttrium nitrate hexahydrate was the precursor, due to alcohol vapor trapped within the particle, whose surface was impermeable in this case.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit548"><sup><span class="sup_ref">548</span></sup></a></p>

They investigated the effect of the precursor solution concentration and pyrolysis temperature on the size, morphology, crystallinity, and photoluminescence of the NPs. The overall precursor concentration was varied from 0.03–1 M in water to control the size. They delivered the aerosol droplets in nitrogen at 2 lpm to the reaction zone at 500 to 1400 °C. The corresponding residence times varied from 1.1 to 2.4 s. Synthesis at temperatures higher than 600 °C produced highly-crystalline particles, and the crystallinity increased with increasing temperature of the reaction zone.

Dextrin serves as a template to form a “multiroom” nanostructure from the Sn-doped NiO after it pyrolyzes to leave large pores with thin walls.

            <span>Kang <span class="italic">et al.</span> studied the synthesis of cerium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) by the same approach. They used aqueous nitrate precursors for yttrium, aluminum, and cerium. The yttrium and aluminum precursors were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio, while the concentration of cerium nitrate varied from 0.5 to 3 at% to achieve optimal doping that maximized photoluminescence intensity, which was found to be 1 at% of cerium. Furthermore, they reported that increasing the overall precursor concentration increased the average particle size. The particles absorbed light from 403 to 510 nm with a maximum at 470 nm, and showed a broad emission from 480 to 650 nm with a maximum at 528 nm. Increasing the annealing temperature produced a monotonic increase in the photoluminescence intensity. Moreover, they observed spherical non-agglomerated particles after annealing at 1300 °C. Indeed, annealing at lower temperatures compared to the conventional synthesis processes produced higher purity and more crystalline Y<small><sub>3</sub></small>Al<small><sub>5</sub></small>O<small><sub>12</sub></small>:Eu particles, due to the microscale confined reaction within the micron-sized aerosol droplets.

They performed the synthesis at temperatures in the range of 600–1200 °C and found that temperatures below 1100 °C produced particles with low crystallinity due to the short residence time of the particles in the reaction zone. However, the as-synthesized particles had high crystallinity at 1200 °C. In addition, they calcined their product at temperatures above 800 °C and observed a change in the crystalline phase for temperatures above 1400 °C. No formation of hard aggregates was observed, even for the particles calcined at 1200 °C. The as-synthesized doped particles absorbed light from 220 to 325 nm with a peak near 240 nm. The main emission peak was at 538 nm. Doping with 4 at% Tb maximized brightness. The dopant was directly activated in the hot wall reactor even at short residence times, demonstrating that calcination at high temperatures was not necessary for its activation.

            <p class="otherpara">Lenggoro <span class="italic">et al.</span> synthesized nickel oxide NPs using a low-pressure spray pyrolysis approach. In their set-up (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig66">Fig. 66a</a>), they used a two-fluid nozzle to spray the precursor solution. A carrier gas delivered the liquid to a porous glass filter surface to form a thin layer of liquid film. After passing through the pores of the glass filter, the liquid film was expanded to a liquid jet and aerosol droplets formed. These were carried into a low-pressure quartz tube furnace with an inner diameter of 38 nm and length of 800 mm, with 5 independent heating zones of equal lengths. The pressure was 10 or 40 Torr. They used nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·6H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), nickel chloride (NiCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>), or nickel formate dihydrate (Ni(HCO<small><sub>2</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·2H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) as the nickel precursor. The effect of precursor choice is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig66">Fig. 66b</a>. Only nickel nitrate produced a nanoparticulate product. In addition, they operated at temperatures of 400 to 1200 °C. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig66">Fig. 66c</a>, increasing the temperature reduced the particle size, and at 900 °C the submicron particles were mainly converted to aggregates of ∼20 nm NPs. Furthermore, they varied the residence time in the reaction zone by changing the flow rate of carrier gas and adjusting the pressure difference between the upper and lower surface of the glass filter. Decreasing the residence time, which increased the heating rate of precursor droplets, led to breakage into smaller particles in the low-pressure spray pyrolysis reactor (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig66">Fig. 66d</a>). Overall, they concluded that the rate of solvent evaporation, precipitate diffusion, and solubility of the precursor are the main factors that must be controlled for synthesis of non-agglomerated NPs in the low-pressure spray pyrolysis system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit521"><sup><span class="sup_ref">521</span></sup></a> They also investigated effects of carrier gas flow rate, precursor solution concentration, pressure, and type of reducing agent on the synthesis of nickel NPs using the same low-pressure spray pyrolysis reactor. The nickel precursor was nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·6H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) and the reducing agents were ethanol (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>5</sub></small>OH), formic acid (HCOOH), and hydrogen. They found the flow rate of the carrier gas and the pressure of the reaction zone were key factors governing the reduction of nickel to its metallic state and the size of nickel NPs. Decreasing the carrier gas flow rate and increasing the pressure increased the possibility of producing submicron particles rather than NPs. In addition, they observed that increasing the precursor solution concentration facilitated the synthesis of NPs, while precursor solutions with a very low concentration, like 0.15 M, yielded submicron particles. Moreover, they successfully reduced the nickel oxide to nickel using ethanol and formic acid as safer alternatives to hydrogen as a reducing agent. Furthermore, they reported that the nickel NPs synthesized by low-pressure spray pyrolysis are more prone to oxidation compared to the submicron particles synthesized by conventional spray pyrolysis, which could be explained by either their higher surface area or incomplete reduction due to decreased exposure to hydrogen (lower hydrogen partial pressure).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit519"><sup><span class="sup_ref">519</span></sup></a></p>

Their experimental set-up (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig68">Fig. 68</a>) included four main units, which were electrospray, reaction, size distribution measurement, and collection. To achieve suitable aerosol flow rates to synthesize NPs of varied size, they employed two different electrospray units. The first comprised a stainless-steel capillary tube with an inner diameter of 0.16 mm which was 5 mm from the ground electrode. The second was a commercial electrospray with an inner diameter of 0.04 mm and a nebulizer inside it. To avoid generation of a corona, they applied a positive polarity to the capillary needle. The aerosol droplets of the precursor solution were delivered in air to a high-temperature tube furnace for reaction. Notably, they added carbon dioxide to the carrier gas as another way to retard the formation of a corona. A scanning mobility particle sizer was used to characterize the aerosol at the inlet and outlet of the tube furnace.

Urea decomposition into gaseous components led to gas generation within the droplets, which the authors considered formation of a gas template. The amount of gas escaping from the aerosol droplets played a key role in the formation of morphologies with varied porosity, while the urea to cobalt source ratio was important to control the size of the NPs. They used the hollow porous microspheres as anode materials in lithium ion batteries. The porosity of the microspheres and the size of NPs affected their performance in the application, and the control of porosity was advantageous to test the relationships between structure and function for the development of cycling stability of electrodes.

They found that increasing the precursor temperature and concentration along with addition of ethanol decreased the average size of aerosol droplets, while increasing the flow rate of carrier gas and the volume rate of spray not only increased the average size of aerosol droplets, but also produced a bimodal aerosol size distribution that they attributed to the onset of coagulation.

They investigated the decomposition mechanism of the anhydrous precursor and inferred that a random nucleation mechanism best matched their observations.

They developed a model of droplet evaporation and precursor precipitation, then employed both experimental and numerical methods to investigate the effects of the operating parameters on the morphology of the synthesized NPs. They found that solid dense NPs were generated at low reactor temperature or with a gradual increase in reaction temperature along the reactor, high concentration of precursor solution, and low carrier gas flow rate. Based upon the simulation results, they found that the low number concentration of aerosol droplets and large aerosol droplets favored the synthesis of hollow NPs. Beyond rationalizing these expected trends, they were able show how solute concentration profiles within droplets that cross the equilibrium solubility limit (above it at the surface, below it in the center) lead to formation of hollow particles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit558"><sup><span class="sup_ref">558</span></sup></a></p>

Their model considered non-continuum effects on the evaporation of the aerosol droplets by combining the continuum based governing equations with an interpolation formula developed from a numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation for the transition regime. These non-continuum effects were found to be significant for evaporation of submicron aerosol droplets at ambient pressure. They considered the thermal decomposition of zirconyl hydroxide chloride (ZrO(OH)Cl) to produce zirconia NPs as a case study and found that for high reactor temperatures, near 400 °C, the NPs had a hollow morphology due to the evaporation rate exceeding the rate of diffusion of precursor within the aerosol droplets, which produced steep intradroplet concentration gradients. Moreover, they found that decreasing the pressure below 250 Torr, or decreasing the size of aerosol droplets from several microns to sub-microns favored the synthesis of NPs with a solid dense morphology due to a decrease in evaporation rate as non-continuum effects became more important. In addition, they reported that increasing the temperature of the reactor increased the size of product NPs, while reactor temperatures below 200 °C facilitated the synthesis of smaller dense NPs. They also investigated the effects of reactor temperature and pressure, and the initial concentration of the precursor solution and found that the normalized size of NPs and the wall thickness are not substantially affected by the reactor pressure, but absolute wall thickness did change with pressure.

The aerosol droplet distribution was determined by a shadowgraphy analysis, which revealed a bimodal size distribution of aerosol droplets. Moreover, they concluded that partial evaporation of the smallest aerosol droplets and the possible coalescence of some aerosol droplets during their delivery to the furnace, because of the flow deflection, resulted in evolution of the aerosol droplet size distribution downstream of the ultrasonic nebulizer.

Iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl<small><sub>3</sub></small>·6H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>·9H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O), and a water-dispersible gel derived from a steel industry byproduct were employed as precursors. Aqueous solutions of iron chloride and iron nitrate were sprayed at four concentrations. Using iron nitrate as the precursor led to spherical NPs, while the chloride precursor produced irregularly shaped NPs. They suggested that the effect of the vapor pressure of precursors on the surface evaporation at the single-droplet level led to the observed difference in morphology. Moreover, they found that higher flow rates of the carrier gas yielded hollow NPs, while a solid dense morphology was achieved at lower flow rates that allowed slower solvent evaporation. They employed models from the literature to calculate the size of NPs and online measurement at the outlet of the reactor to find the average size of NPs experimentally. They reported that the solubility of the precursor plays a significant role in the average size of NPs; precursors with low solubility favored the synthesis of larger NPs with a hollow morphology. Furthermore, they found that addition of ethanol to the precursor generated a shell of carbon and/or iron carbide on the iron oxide core NPs. In addition, the oxidation state of the NPs could be tuned by adjusting the composition of spraying and post-calcination gas. Post-calcination under hydrogen at 400 °C followed by cooling to ambient conditions under hydrogen produced metallic iron particles.

          <span>In flame-based synthesis methods, chemical energy is converted to thermal energy in the flame. Like laser and plasma methods, this initially heats only the gas phase, and does not require heat conduction from the surroundings, which enables much faster heating and cooling rates than in CVC or spray pyrolysis. Generally, easy synthesis of simple oxides at short residence times, demonstrated scale up for oxide nanomaterials, simple and relatively inexpensive equipment, and high purity are advantages of flame synthesis, while hard agglomeration, broad particle size distribution, non-uniform temperature and velocity profiles, and difficulty in producing non-oxide materials are disadvantages of the flame-based synthesis methods.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> In general, flame-based aerosol synthesis methods are classified as Vapor-fed Aerosol Flame Synthesis (VAFS) methods and Liquid-fed Aerosol Flame Synthesis (LAFS) methods, as discussed in the following paragraphs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit581"><sup><span class="sup_ref">581</span></sup></a></span>

Nevertheless, Bonne, Homann, Grewer and Wagner can be considered pioneers of the scientific understanding of this field for using a novel approach to studying formation of carbon NPs in premixed flat flames.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit623"><sup><span class="sup_ref">623,624</span></sup></a> A schematic of their flame reactor is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig81">Fig. 81</a>. They employed flat flames burning on cooled porous plate burners at pressures of 10 to 60 Torr. The flames used oxygen as the oxidant with fuels such as methane (CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>), acetylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>), ethylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>), propane (C<small><sub>3</sub></small>H<small><sub>8</sub></small>), benzene (C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small>), ethanol (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>5</sub></small>OH), and a mixture of carbon disulfide and hydrogen (CS<small><sub>2</sub></small>:H<small><sub>2</sub></small>). Liquid fuels were vaporized by a flow of nitrogen, while the gases directly came from cylinders. They used a sensitive mass spectrometer to monitor stable products, free radicals, and other short-lived species to find the concentration profiles of carbon-containing species before and during the production of carbon NPs (soot). A quartz probe was directly connected to the ion source of a mass spectrometer to take samples. A stream of gas from the flame was extracted into the mass spectrometer through a 100 μm hole in the probe under critical flow conditions. High-speed pumping behind the probe expanded the entering beam rapidly. They minimized the wall influence on the NPs arriving at the mass spectrometer using a slit at the middle of the beam to allow only the center portion of the stream of NPs to enter the mass spectrometer. Using this approach, they found that the formation of polyacetylenes was the key factor in the formation of carbon NPs. The polyacetylenes reached a maximum concentration early in the reaction zone and approached a constant final value in the burned gas, which increased with increasing fuel content. A short distance behind the oxidation zone, particles with a diameter near 4 nm could be collected and imaged by electron microscopy. The agglomeration of the ultrafine particles along with the addition of high polyacetylenes and polyacetylene radicals, in the region where the concentration of the polyacetylenes decreased, led to an increase in the size and decrease in the number density of carbon NPs. Finally, radicals were converted to the final products and the amount of carbon NPs, the average size of NPs and the particle number remained constant, while acetylene and polyacetylenes remained at relatively high concentration in the final products.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit623"><sup><span class="sup_ref">623,624</span></sup></a> The study of soot formation has since grown into an entire scientific field of its own, which has many aspects in common with vapor-phase synthesis of other nanomaterials, but also many unique features.

            <span>Chung and Katz developed a rectangular counterflow diffusion flame burner for the synthesis of silica NPs from silane (SiH<small><sub>4</sub></small>). A schematic of their synthesis set-up is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig82">Fig. 82</a>. The burner consisted of two opposing vertical conduits of rectangular cross-section, from which fuel and oxidant flowed, meeting in a stagnation plane. The fuel and the oxidant were hydrogen and oxygen, both diluted in argon. The fuel flowed upward, while the oxidant flowed downward and combustion products flowed outward. Stainless-steel plates with a thickness of 40 μm divided each tube into three channels: two side channels with dimensions of 12.70 mm × 6.35 mm and a central main channel with dimensions of 12.70 mm × 63.50 mm. To force the combustion gases to exit only <span class="italic">via</span> the long sides, they fitted fused silica plates to the outside of the two side channels. A bed of glass beads, several fiberglass layers, a perforated plate, and three stainless-steel 40 mesh wire screens were employed to create a uniform gas flow across the burner outlets. To seal the system and maintain the flow of outward gas parallel to the surfaces of the burner, they fitted flanges on each side of the burner openings. As a result, the produced flame was stable, flat, and rectangular in shape. The concentrations and the temperatures were uniform across the horizontal plane. The flame color was light blue before the addition of silane into the fuel and it changed to a whitish light yellow after the addition of silane. The flame brightness increased with increasing silane flow rate. Upon addition of 9.3 sccm of silane, a second thin orange flame appeared on the fuel side of the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> flame zone. There was a dark space between the two flames which corresponded to an intense peak in light scattering. In addition, they found that homogeneous nucleation occurred to produce a high particle concentration upon injection of silane at a flow rate beyond a critical value of 2.3 sccm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit641"><sup><span class="sup_ref">641</span></sup></a> Hung and Katz employed this system to produce crystalline rutile titania NPs coated with an amorphous layer of silica, which were promising for catalysis applications. For this, titanium tetrachloride and silicon tetrachloride were decomposed in hydrogen–oxygen flames. Moreover, they studied the effect of the flame temperature and silicon to titanium precursor ratio on the morphology of the nanocomposites, finding that flame temperature had the greatest effect on the morphology. Titania NPs were encapsulated by silica at low temperatures and high silicon to titanium ratios, while discrete silica particles covered the titania NPs at high temperatures and low silicon to titanium ratios (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig83">Fig. 83</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit651"><sup><span class="sup_ref">651</span></sup></a></span>

            <p class="otherpara">Hurd and Flower studied the structure of flame-made silica NPs by <span class="italic">in situ</span> static and dynamic light scattering and <span class="italic">ex situ</span> TEM imaging. Liquid hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sub>2</sub></small>), methane, and oxygen were the silicon precursor, fuel, and oxidant, respectively. Growth and aggregation of the particles evolved with position in the flame. Based on scattering measurements, the fractal dimension of the aggregates was about 1.49, although it could not be determined precisely. Based on the dynamic light scattering results for polydispersity, they found that the growth trend did not match expectations for an aggregation-condensation process in the free-molecular regime. TEM results surprisingly showed evidence of silica clusters shrinking with increasing residence time in the flame (height above the burner).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit642"><sup><span class="sup_ref">642</span></sup></a> Zachariah <span class="italic">et al.</span> further studied the synthesis of silica NPs using a counterflow diffusion flame reactor with silane as the silicon precursor and an argon-diluted hydrogen–oxygen flame. They studied the effect of temperature, silane loading, equivalence, and momentum ratios on the process and found that flame temperature was the most important factor. At temperatures of around 2000 K, they observed surface growth of initial nuclei, while increasing the flame temperature led to smaller particles in higher number concentration. In addition, they observed that faster reaction at higher temperatures of around 2500 K led to the nucleation of other particle compositions rather than SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which could grow by subsequent silica deposition. Moreover, spherical particles were produced at sufficiently high temperatures due to sintering. Furthermore, they observed that silane loading affected the average particle size along with the growth regime. Higher silane loadings accelerated the nucleation of particles, producing larger particles <span class="italic">via</span> surface growth processes. They concluded that they could control the final product morphology and the process yield by adjusting the processing parameters.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit643"><sup><span class="sup_ref">643</span></sup></a> In another study, they synthesized SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanocomposites by decomposing three different sets of precursors in CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>:O<small><sub>2</sub></small> flames. Combinations of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>) with silicon tetrachloride (SiCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>), silicon tetrabromide (SiBr<small><sub>4</sub></small>), or hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sub>2</sub></small>) were used as precursors. The average size of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanocomposites was 15 nm. In addition, they produced silica NPs with an average size of 10 nm using the three different precursors and titania NPs with an average size of 13 nm. They found the size of single component silica NPs and the species distribution in the nanocomposites were independent of the silicon precursor.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit652"><sup><span class="sup_ref">652</span></sup></a> They synthesized binary SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> NPs in addition to binary SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs with diameters below 100 nm and various molar ratios of titanium or iron to silicon using the same system. They observed segregation in the particles comparable to that expected based on equilibrium phase behavior of the systems at the flame temperature.

            <p class="otherpara">Almquist and Biswas investigated the effect of particle size on the photocatalytic activity of titania NPs. They produced anatase titania NPs with average sizes of 5 to 48 nm by thermal decomposition of titanium tetraisopropoxide in methane flames with oxygen and air. They also calcined commercially available titania NPs at temperatures in the range of 170 to 700 °C to increase their effective particle size, and tested conventional TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> powders (DeGussa P25, and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from Aldrich) to span an effective size range from 5 to 165 nm. They tested activity for photodegradation of phenol in water and found that particle size played a substantial role in the apparent photocatalytic activity of the titania NPs, particularly for effective particle sizes below 30 nm. In that range, an increase in the particle size led to a significant increase in apparent photocatalytic activity, probably because of the substantial particle size dependence of the efficiency of light absorption and charge-carrier dynamics in NPs with sizes in this range. Based on this dependence, they concluded that the optimum effective particle size was in the range of 25 to 40 nm. The available surface area for redox reactions played a more important role in the photocatalytic activity of titania NPs for effective particle sizes above 30 nm. Accordingly, increasing the particle size beyond 30 nm led to a decrease in the apparent photocatalytic activity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit656"><sup><span class="sup_ref">656</span></sup></a></p>

            <span>Mädler and Pratsinis employed a flame-based pyrolysis technique to produce pure, homogeneous, and tetragonal crystalline β-Bi<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> NPs with controlled size and crystallinity with specific surface areas of 20 to 80 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at production rates of 6 to 46 g h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Bismuth(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) nitrate heptahydrate (Bi(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>·5H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) was the solid precursor, which was dissolved in two different solvents. Using a mixture of nitric acid and ethanol as solvent produced a combination of sintered dense spherical NPs with average diameters between 50 to 100 nm and aggregates of primary particles with mean diameters of 10 nm, along with hollow particles of approximately 1 μm diameter, produced by a droplet-to-particle conversion mechanism (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig88">Fig. 88a</a>). In contrast use of acetic acid led as solvent produced solid NPs by a gas-to-particle conversion mechanism due to the generation of an acetobismuth complex that evaporated before decomposing (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig88">Fig. 88b</a>). They investigated the effect of acetic acid to ethanol ratio to elucidate the solvent influence on the process and found that increasing this ratio led to an increase in the crystallinity and the homogeneity of the NPs. Only nanograined particles were formed for acetic acid fractions above 0.6. In addition, they reported that using bismuth acetate instead of bismuth nitrate produced the same NPs, illustrating that the ion composition in the precursor solution is more important than the precursor itself. They increased the specific surface area of the NPs from 20 to 80 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> by increasing the flow rate of oxygen dispersion gas and decreasing the feed rate of the precursor.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit725"><sup><span class="sup_ref">725</span></sup></a> Pratsinis's group employed the same process to generate monocrystalline zinc oxide NPs. The zinc oxide primary particles were smaller and more homogeneous than the zinc oxide primary particles synthesized by other techniques. Zinc acrylate (C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>Zn) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and acetic acid for use as a precursor. By adjusting the feed rate of the precursor solution, they controlled the mean primary particle diameter in the range of 10 to 20 nm. Increasing the feed rate of precursor solution increased the flame height and consequently enhanced coalescence and/or surface growth which increased the mean primary particle diameter. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig89">Fig. 89</a> shows the morphologies of the flame-synthesized ZnO nanomaterials produced at different precursor feed rates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit692"><sup><span class="sup_ref">692</span></sup></a> Moreover, they synthesized zinc oxide nanorods doped with tin and indium by this scalable flame-based aerosol technique. In this case, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc naphthenate (C<small><sub>22</sub></small>H<small><sub>14</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>Zn) in toluene (C<small><sub>7</sub></small>H<small><sub>8</sub></small>) and stannous 2-ethylhexanoate (C<small><sub>16</sub></small>H<small><sub>30</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>Sn) in tetrahydrofuran ((CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>)<small><sub>4</sub></small>O) for tin-doping, or indium acetylacetonate (C<small><sub>15</sub></small>H<small><sub>21</sub></small>O<small><sub>6</sub></small>In) for indium-doping. The doping level was up to 10 at%. These two dopants selectively passivate specific zinc oxide crystal planes and were incorporated into its lattice. Increasing the doping concentration led to an increase in the specific surface area of the NPs and this increase was sharper for doping with tin than with indium. In addition, doping with tin affected the synthesis of nanorods more than doping with indium at low dopant levels. They attributed growth of nanorods to the higher valency and coordination of tin and indium as dopants compared to zinc, which disrupted growth in particular lattice directions. Moreover, they doped zinc oxide with lithium using lithium acetylacetonate (C<small><sub>5</sub></small>H<small><sub>7</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>Li) or lithium <span class="italic">tert</span>-butoxide (C<small><sub>4</sub></small>H<small><sub>9</sub></small>OLi) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. They observed that doping with lithium, which has an equivalent ionic radius to tin and indium, but a valency lower than zinc, did not affect the zinc oxide texture, supporting their hypothesis about the effect of higher valency of the dopants on the formation of nanorods. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig90">Fig. 90</a> presents the morphologies of the zinc oxide nanomaterials containing 4 at% of each dopant.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit696"><sup><span class="sup_ref">696</span></sup></a></span>

            <p class="otherpara">Pawinrat <span class="italic">et al.</span> synthesized Au–ZnO and Pt–ZnO nanocomposites by a single-step flame-based aerosol pyrolysis technique. For Au–ZnO nanocomposites, they used zinc naphthenate (C<small><sub>22</sub></small>H<small><sub>14</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>Zn) and gold(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>·3H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) dissolved in ethanol (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>5</sub></small>OH).

They found that zinc oxide is produced first, followed by metallic gold or platinum. The mean size of the metal particles was 3 to 7 nm, which was affected by metal loading (1 or 3%), while the ZnO particles were roughly an order of magnitude larger. Among these two types of nanocomposites, Au–ZnO enhanced the photocatalytic activity of zinc oxide for degradation of methylene blue, although both of them were similar in physical properties. Indeed, the presence of discrete gold clusters shifted the Fermi level and led to accumulation of photoexcited electrons, slowing recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Gold-loaded particles had more intense visible light absorption and weaker photoluminescence emission intensity than bare zinc oxide NPs. However, the authors concluded that the Fermi-level shift upon Pt-decoration of ZnO allowed electrons to be discharged into the electrolyte, such that the photocatalytic activity did not improve. Gold loading of 3% gave the best photocatalytic performance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit700"><sup><span class="sup_ref">700</span></sup></a></p>

Their experimental set-up is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig91">Fig. 91</a>. The precursors were delivered to the reaction zone from a bubbler through a central tube in pure oxygen or oxygen diluted with air or nitrogen. Three other gaseous flows were injected to the reaction zone through three concentric tubes surrounding the central tube. The middle concentric flow was hydrogen, the fuel. Nitrogen flowed through the inner concentric region, between the central oxidizer flow and concentric fuel flow, to delay mixing and prevent plugging of the burner by particles generated too close to it. The outer region delivered additional oxygen to adjust the temperature of the flame. This played a substantial role in the process especially when the amount of oxygen in the carrier gas was decreased to decrease the flow rate of precursors and increase the residence time, which was important to adjust the size and morphology of the NPs. An electrostatic precipitator was used to collect the NPs. Three conditions were important for the synthesis of NPs in their system: (a) the stability of the oxide at the flame temperature, which was in the range of 1700 to 3000 K and could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen, (b) sufficiently fast oxidation and/or hydrolysis reaction of the precursors at the flame temperature, and (c) high volatility of the precursors. Spherical nonporous and monodispersed NPs of various oxides with sizes in the range of 10 to 200 nm were produced. They reported that the size and morphology of the NPs depended upon the precursor concentration, the residence time and the flame temperature.

The precursor was dispersed by oxygen and delivered at 5 sccm through the nozzle into a ring-shaped premixed methane-oxygen flame. The final sensor material was obtained by forming a paste of the flame-synthesized NPs, drying, and annealing at 600 °C for 1 hour to improve their thermal and mechanical stability. The flame-made doped NPs outperformed both undoped flame-made NPs and doped NPs synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Upon incorporation into a chemoresistive sensor, the flame-synthesized 1 at% Al-doped ZnO NPs showed a large sensing response of 245 (relative change in resistance) with a response time of around 3 s and a sensitivity of 23 ppm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> upon exposure to ∼10 ppm acetone at 450 °C, while these values were 54, around 12 s, and 4 ppm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the NPs synthesized by a hydrothermal method.

Notably, the acetone selectivity of these doped NPs can also be extended to other compounds of practical interest, such as ammonia, isoprene, and carbon monoxide. They suggested that the improvement in the sensing activity of the flame-synthesized Al-doped ZnO NPs compared to the pristine NPs and the NPs synthesized by a hydrothermal method can be attributed to the higher concentration of oxygen vacancies which resulted in greater adsorption of oxygen ions, which react with acetone molecules, on the surface of the flame-synthesized Al-doped ZnO NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit695"><sup><span class="sup_ref">695</span></sup></a></p>

Short and cold flames produced pure monoclinic NPs, while long and hot flames generated mostly cubic phase NPs due to the longer residence time in the flame which facilitated the growth and transformation into this phase. This conversion from a compact to a less dense phase was accompanied by a particle size increase.

They investigated the effects of operating parameters on the specific surface area, crystallinity, particle size, catalytic activity, and thermal stability. Increasing the precursor concentration and the precursor feed rate at constant oxygen to precursor ratio, and decreasing the oxygen linear discharge velocity and oxygen flow rate under subsonic conditions, led to decreases in specific surface area and catalytic activity, and increases in the crystallinity, particle size, and thermal stability.

The precursor was sprayed using an oxygen flow of 5 lpm through a nozzle into oxygen-methane subsidiary flamelets. The pristine LaFeO<small><sub>3</sub></small> NPs exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity for acetylene concentrations below 500 ppm, outperforming LaFeO<small><sub>3</sub></small> NPs synthesized by a sol–gel technique.

Increasing the ratio of precursor to oxygen, the atomizing gas, increased the temperature, residence time, and iron concentration in the flame, which resulted in larger crystallite size and higher cation vacancy concentration. Accordingly, they could gradually convert the morphology of the NPs from quasi-spherical to two-dimensional hexagonal/octagonal platelet shapes, and adjust the crystallinity from disordered cubic phase to fully ordered tetragonal γ-Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> as the particle size increased (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig94">Fig. 94</a>).

            <span>Wegner and Pratsinis investigated scale-up of vapor-fed flame aerosol synthesis, focusing on the well-studied titania and silica systems. Their reactor system (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig99">Fig. 99a</a>) consisted of a precursor delivery system, a particle collection unit, and a co-flow diffusion flame reactor with three concentric tubes to pass argon as the carrier gas containing the precursor, oxygen as the oxidant, and methane as the fuel. They employed three different co-flow burners with outer diameters of 5.6, 10, and 27 mm (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig99">Fig. 99b</a>). The flow rates of argon and methane, and the feed rate of the precursor were held constant at 0.3 lpm, 0.5 lpm, and 6.5 g h<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for all three burners, respectively, while the flow rate of oxygen could be adjusted in the range of 1 to 50 lpm to control the size of NPs produced. Increasing the flow rate of oxygen led to a transition from laminar to turbulent flames. The velocity difference between the fuel and oxygen jets at the burner outlet played a substantial role in governing reactant mixing and quenching of these flames. They analysed the primary NP size based on this velocity difference and found that results for all three reactors with different co-flow burners collapsed onto a single curve for each material. NPs with the same primary particle diameter could be synthesized at the same velocity difference between the fuel and oxygen jets with over-ventilated single diffusion flames which was advantageous to control the reactor process. In addition, they scaled by a factor of 0.25, 0.5, 3, and 5 the standard conditions for the synthesis of silica NPs. They observed different operating lines in the plots of the primary particle diameter based on the velocity difference after the scale-up, but in each case the operating line followed an exponential function with two constants for the smallest and largest mean primary particle diameters (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig99">Fig. 99c</a>).

A 3D schematic of the HTRJ reactor is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig101">Fig. 101</a>. They combined hydrogen reduction with thermal decomposition to synthesize metal NPs, rather than the more common metal oxides. In their set-up, about 2 lpm of oxygen was introduced into the combustion zone through a central tube, while about 10 lpm of a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>:N<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixture was introduced through a surrounding concentric annular region to form an inverted diffusion flame. They used a converging-diverging nozzle to accelerate the hot combustion products and injected a precursor solution into the throat or the diverging portion of the nozzle. By adjusting the length and diameter of the region between the nozzle and the quench zone as the particle nucleation and growth section, they could control the residence time in the region in the range from milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds. They designed the process for a residence time of ∼50 ms with a total gas flow rate in the range of 10 to 20 lpm. An excess flow of about 100 lpm nitrogen at the outlet of the reactor was used to quench the process, enabling the synthesis of loosely-agglomerated NPs. To test their system, they first produced carbon-coated copper NPs as a prototype for non-oxide materials that could not be easily synthesized in conventional flame-based aerosol processes. Copper formate (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>CuO<small><sub>4</sub></small>) was selected as the precursor because of its ability to directly produce carbon-coated NPs as well as its high water solubility, low cost, and decomposition to the favored product and environmentally safe byproducts.

            <span>Ulrich performed a valuable study on the mechanism of NP growth in flame-based synthesis of silica NPs using a Brownian collision-coalescence model. He used silicon tetrachloride (SiCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen to produce a flame that generated silica clusters with average particle diameters of 13.6 and 6.8 nm and specific surface areas of 200 and 400 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. The translational velocities and collision frequencies of the silicon NPs were modeled as those of large gas molecules due to their very small size (behavior described as the free-molecular regime in aerosol dynamics). Because of a relatively short chemical reaction and nucleation period compared to the total synthesis period, the product size distribution was only affected by Brownian collisions and was independent of the early history of the system. Accordingly, the mean logarithm of particle size was directly proportional to the mean logarithm of the growth time. To cool the NPs to temperatures where they do not sinter, a secondary air flow was injected into the commercial flame jets which made the growth time and the average particle size dependent on the initial flame temperature. He concluded that the mechanism could be expanded to treat the synthesis of carbon and other oxides synthesized by flame-based approaches if the size of primary particles was relatively small compared to the mean-free path of gas molecules, the reaction times were relatively short compared to the quench times, and the supersaturation ratios were sufficiently high.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit639"><sup><span class="sup_ref">639</span></sup></a> In another study, Ulrich and Riehl employed CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> flames for the thermal decomposition of SiCl<small><sub>4</sub></small> to synthesize silica NPs.

            <p class="otherpara">Landgrebe and Pratsinis derived a self-preserving map in the process parameter space of dimensionless chemical reaction time and dimensionless process residence time for aerosol synthesis of NPs with a finite rate of precursor reaction or decomposition. Though we discuss this landmark paper here, in the context of flame-based synthesis, because of its generality, it is equally applicable to CVC or other processes with finite rates of monomer generation followed by aggregation and sintering. In general, if allowed to aggregate and sinter for sufficient time, any aerosol will approach a self-preserving size distribution that is approximately log-normal and that changes in mean size and number concentration, but not in shape, with further coagulation and sintering.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit728"><sup><span class="sup_ref">728,729</span></sup></a> Landgrebe and Pratsinis developed a dimensionless discrete-sectional model for free-molecular aerosol coagulation and validated it by examining the section spacing and numerically conserved aerosol characteristics such as number concentration, volume concentration, and volume squared concentration. The self-preserving map described conditions, particularly the minimum dimensionless time, required to synthesize NPs with the asymptotic self-preserving size distribution. The required time to reach a self-preserving size distribution was four times the characteristic time for the coagulation of monomers when reaction (monomer generation) was instantaneous (dimensionless time for reaction &lt;0.25), while it reached around 15 times the characteristic dimensionless time for chemical reaction for slower reactions. Moreover, they compared the results from their discrete-sectional model to moment models for coagulation that assumed a monodispersed, self-preserving, or lognormal aerosol size distribution function. They found that the results from the discrete-section model were in good agreement with the all three moment models in terms of integral aerosol characteristics for the case of instantaneous reaction, while the moment models could not predict the geometric mean diameter, the total number concentration, and geometric standard deviation reliably in the non-self-preserving region of the self-preserving map for conditions with slower precursor reaction and monomer generation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit730"><sup><span class="sup_ref">730</span></sup></a></p>

This allowed particles to migrate along the surface of the growing aggregates to simulate sintering. They observed that more compact aggregates formed due to the enhanced surface mobility of monomers at sufficiently high temperatures. The fractal dimension and the sintering rate decreased at longer times (more Monte Carlo steps) as the particles became larger. Moreover, they found that the surface area of aggregates was a more useful and reliable descriptor of aggregate structure than the fractal dimension, due to its greater sensitivity to changes in the simulation conditions such as the reaction temperature and the sintering rate. The main challenge in Monte Carlo simulations is the consideration of two different time scales for the simulation (those of aggregation and sintering) and linking these time scales to real time, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> residence time in a flame. To solve this challenge, they defined an effective sintering rate through the time evolution of the surface area of aggregates to relate the two time scales in the model.

They investigated the effect of oxidant and precursor solvent/fuel composition with different enthalpy contents on the specific surface area of the flame-made NPs. For this, they considered the production of silica NPs from precursor solutions of hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sub>2</sub></small>) in methanol, ethanol, or iso-octane. Oxygen and air were each used as both dispersion gas and as oxidant. They employed a spray combustion model to compute the droplet lifetime and describe the effect of oxidant/dispersion gas type on the structure of the flame and the characteristics of the synthesized NPs. They observed that increasing the flow rate of oxidant at low oxidant flow rates increased the specific surface area of NPs because it resulted in shorter residence times in the shortened spray flame, and thus, less time for growth of NPs. The specific surface area reached a maximum and then decreased at higher flow rates of the oxidant as the flame height further decreased. At the highest oxidant flows, both solvent (fuel) and precursor oxidized faster in a smaller volume, reaching higher temperatures that induced a higher sintering rate. They observed this maximum for both methanol and ethanol. For iso-octane, with higher enthalpy content driving faster evaporation and combustion, increasing the flow rate of oxidant produced a monotonic decrease in specific surface area. Further increase in the flow rate of oxidant did not allow sufficient heat transfer and time for ignition from the assisting flamelets, and the main flame was extinguished. Iso-octane with the lowest volatility exhibited the longest ignition delay among the three fuels.

            <p class="otherpara">Some of the most sophisticated experimental and simulation studies of aerosol particle formation have been developed for soot formation. These are most often driven by a desire to prevent unwanted soot formation, but are also applicable to intentional synthesis of nanomaterials, particularly carbon black. In an exemplary study, Zhao <span class="italic">et al.</span> measured the soot particle size distribution function (PSDF) in a laminar premixed ethylene flame using a scanning mobility particle sizer, which detected particles down to a mobility diameter of 3 nm, in combination with a carefully-designed sampling and dilution system that quenched chemical reactions and minimized coagulation and losses in the sampling system. They studied the evolution of the PSDF from the very early stages of soot nucleation to particle mass growth. They observed that the PSDF followed a power-law dependence on particle diameter at the very early stages of soot formation, then became bimodal at higher positions above the burner surface, and maintained a bimodal distribution in the post-flame region. The small-particle part of the PSDF followed a power-law function, while the large-particle part of the PSDF was approximately log-normal. They employed a detailed numerical simulation to analyze the experimental results, in which the flame structure was described with detailed reaction kinetics and species transport. Nucleation and growth of the soot particles were also described through a kinetic model that included both surface growth and oxidation. In addition, they used a stochastic method to simulate the evolution of the PSDF. The numerical simulation was in a good agreement with experimental data, also predicting the bimodal distribution of the PSDF. Further analysis of the aerosol dynamics equations revealed that the bimodal behavior is intrinsic to an aerosol process involving cluster–cluster coagulation with nucleation of particles dominated by monomer dimerization.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit735"><sup><span class="sup_ref">735</span></sup></a></p>

They used simplified kinetic expressions for nucleation, molecular growth, and oxidation of the soot particles, and a Brownian aggregation kernel. Furthermore, they simulated the fractal dimension evolution with a monovariate population balance as the simplest means to track the evolution of the morphology of the aggregated NPs. While the volume fraction of soot is well predicted, independent of assumptions about fractal dimension, because it does not depend on aggregation, the overall aggregate size was quite sensitive to fractal dimension. Thus, they showed that a suitable treatment of the particle fractal dimension was necessary to reasonably predict the morphology and overall size of the soot aggregates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit736"><sup><span class="sup_ref">736</span></sup></a></p>

They investigated the sensitivity of the soot PSDs to the defining soot model parameters such as soot inception, particle and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) collision efficiency and enhancement, and soot surface activity. They observed that increasing size of incepting soot particles played a significant role in the lower end of the PSDs, especially the position of the trough between modes in bimodal soot PSDs. Accordingly, understanding the chemistry of higher PAHs and a more detailed inception model in the case of interaction of PAHs to give different sizes of incepting soot particles are necessary for the precise prediction of soot PSDs. They also developed a new model to predict surface activity decay, in which only the soot particle history and the local flame temperature affected the soot particle activity.

Changes in the particle inception size and the coagulation rate produced an overall shift in the coagulation peak position. Moreover, they observed that a systematic shift in the both position of the trough between the bimodal PSD modes and the coagulation peak at larger diameters were both driven by particle inception size changes.

            <p class="otherpara">In another report, Kraft's group investigated the evolution of particle size distribution function (PSDF) in premixed stretch-stabilized flat ethylene-oxygen-argon flames to study the formation of soot in a pseudo-one-dimensional flow configuration that extended the experimental flame condition space by stretch-stabilization. They considered three sets of atmospheric-pressure ethylene-oxygen-argon flames with maximum temperatures of approximately 1980, 2000, and 2160 K to measure PSDFs and found strong dependence of PSDFs on the flame temperature. In agreement with prior studies, soot nucleation and growth stopped or reversed at sufficiently high temperatures. They observed a bimodal size distribution for PSDFs for the lower-temperature flames with peak temperatures of approximately 1980 K, while they were unimodal for the higher flame temperatures. Although the population balance soot modelling results were in reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the flames with maximum temperatures around 1980 and 2000 K, it predicted the size and number density of soot to be much higher than the experimental results in the flame with a maximum temperature of around 2160 K. Based on sensitivity analyses, they proposed that the high temperature reversibility in soot nucleation, coagulation, and surface growth is the main reason for this overprediction. Accordingly, taking the thermodynamic reversibility of these processes into account is of great importance for the precise prediction of soot formation at temperatures above 2000 K.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit740"><sup><span class="sup_ref">740</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Botero <span class="italic">et al.</span> presented a theoretical and experimental investigation of the evolution of primary soot particles along the centerline of a co-flow laminar diffusion flame. They analyzed the size and nano-structure of soot particles from the ethylene flame, which were taken at various heights above the burner. They observed that the initial soot NPs, after nucleation, coagulate and coalescence to generate primary particles with a size of 5 to 15 nm. Coagulation and surface growth led to an increase in the size of the primary soot NPs along the centerline of the flame. Then, an amorphous layer of hydrocarbons condensed on the surface of these NPs which facilitated aggregation of primary particles into fractal-like structures. Higher temperatures in the flame led to fast carbonization of the amorphous layer to form a graphitic shell around the primary NPs. This graphitization reduced the size of NPs by compacting the primary particles. Thereafter, rapid oxidization near the flame tip reduced the size of NPs. Notably, based upon the experimental results, the primary particle size distribution was unimodal and relatively sharp at all the heights above the burner. It broadened and shifted toward larger size during particle growth, then shrunk and narrowed in the oxidation region of the flame. Moreover, they employed a detailed population balance model to study the mechanisms affecting the primary particle size distribution. They showed that although the average size of primary particles was relatively insensitive to model parameters such as sintering pre-factor, smoothing factor, and critical diameter for “liquid-like” behavior, the primary particle size distributions were sensitive to these factors. Accordingly, good agreement between the modelling and experimental results for the average size of primary particles is not a guarantee that the simulation results predict the primary particle size distributions precisely.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit741"><sup><span class="sup_ref">741</span></sup></a> This group also investigated the evolution of the soot particle size distribution in an <span class="italic">n</span>-heptane/toluene co-flow diffusion flame along its centerline.

They added 0–15 mol% toluene to <span class="italic">n</span>-heptane and found that with increasing concentration of toluene, soot inception occurred at lower height above the burner (lower in the flame) which caused a larger soot growth zone and thus, an increase in the size of soot primary and agglomerated NPs.

            <p class="otherpara">Mehta <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a multiscale tool for modelling TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> synthesis from TiCl<small><sub>4</sub></small> in a realistic turbulent flame aerosol reactor. They studied the effect of various chemical mechanisms, including one-step, detailed, and flamelet models, on the nucleation of NPs. They first employed a plug-flow reactor (PFR) and a partially stirred tank reactor (PaSR) to simulate the flow field under relatively ideal conditions. The simultaneous development of detailed chemical mechanisms to define gas-phase combustion and the evolution of particles, along with advanced tools to simulate the turbulent flow field and its interactions with the chemical processes, are necessary to develop such a predictive simulation. Toward this goal, they proposed a combination one-step/detailed model and a flamelet model to describe detailed chemistry for the nucleation of particles and combustion. The PFR simulation results showed that most nuclei were generated upstream of the flame surface for the one-step nucleation mechanism and then passed through the high-temperature zone in the flame, while the bulk of the nuclei were generated downstream of the flame surface for the, presumably more realistic, detailed nucleation mechanism. Thus, the one-step nucleation mechanism should predict very different high-temperature sintering behavior, in comparison with the detailed nucleation mechanism. The PaSR modelling revealed that, although there was a clear difference between the one-step and detailed nucleation mechanisms, the vigorous back mixing inside the turbulent flow led to formation of quite uniform particles. For the one-step nucleation mechanism, increasing the flame temperature increased the nucleation rate and the nucleation took place on the lean side of the flame, while it was predicted on both the lean and rich sides using the detailed mechanism, which predicted nucleation at temperatures ranging from 1500 K to 1800 K. In addition, they developed a large-eddy simulation tool to investigate the dependence of the synthesis of NPs in turbulent flames on the precursor injection configuration and saw that the formation of NPs happened very close to the surface of the flame in the case of the one-step nucleation mechanism, which was in agreement with results from PFR and PaSR simulations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit743"><sup><span class="sup_ref">743</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Shekar <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a chemical kinetic model for simulating the flame-based aerosol synthesis of silica NPs from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (SiC<small><sub>8</sub></small>H<small><sub>20</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>).

They incorporated new particle inception and surface growth steps into a stochastic particle model in which the interaction of silicic acid monomers led to the formation and growth of particles. They considered the coagulation and sintering of particles in the model. They employed low discrepancy sequences to fit the model to the experimental data for collision and primary particle diameters and extract material-dependent sintering parameters consistent with experimental results.

They fully coupled the model to the flow and gas phase chemistry and solved the PBE for particle size using the method of moments with interpolative closure (MoMIC), assuming spherical particles due to the high flame temperature. They accounted for a free-jet region in the flow by matching the simulated OH* peak location with the experimentally observed position. Although they obtained good agreement between the modelling and experimental data on the mobility particle size with changes in the loading level of the precursor, they underpredicted the geometric standard deviation at high precursor loadings. Moreover, they reported high sensitivity of the particle size to the sampling location close to the stationary stagnation surface based upon the modelling results, which increased with increasing stagnation temperature and loading level of the precursor. Coagulation was the dominant process near the stagnation surface. Furthermore, they evaluated the effect of surface growth by comparison to results using an alternative reaction model and revealed the significant role of surface growth in the very early stage of particle formation.

To analyze the composition and temperature changes due to heat and mass transfer within the burning droplets, based on the experimentally-observed droplet size changes and rainbow patterns, they developed a multicomponent diffusion-limited transport model. Accordingly, they suggested the following mechanism for the droplet evolution and micro-explosions: (i) Droplet ignition resulted an initial increase in the rainbow scattering maximum angle, due to a sharp increase in the surface temperature and then, a decrease associated with the subsequent temperature equilibration between core and surface. (ii) Accumulation of the metal–organic precursor with a low vapor pressure at the surface of the droplets upon evaporation of the more volatile solvent limited solvent transport to the flame. This led to flame contraction and droplet surface reheating which then drove thermal decomposition of the precursor. This caused the formation of a viscous shell as a diffusive barrier for the solvent inside the droplet. Hence, a second increase in the rainbow maxima angle was observed as a result of the temperature gradient between the core and surface of the droplets. (iii) The subsequent temperature balance between the core and surface again decreased the rainbow angle maximum. The increasing temperature inside the droplet initiated the nucleation of vapor bubbles of the high volatility component, which caused the droplet micro-explosion. They observed a substantial difference in rainbow pattern evolution between precursor-laden droplets that undergo micro-explosions and single component droplets. Moreover, they found that the metal–organic precursor concentration significantly affected the required time for the droplet micro-explosions and the rainbow pattern evolution of the burning droplets. Indeed, increasing the concentration of metal–organic precursor reduced the time required for the droplet micro explosions by increasing the rate of accumulation of the precursor at the surface of the droplets and its subsequent decomposition and shell formation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit753"><sup><span class="sup_ref">753</span></sup></a></p>

Then, they investigated the performance of these two models and determined that the GAN model performed much better than the VAE. Results from the GAN model met both generalization and accuracy criteria, while a distinct trade-off between these criteria was unavoidable for VAE. Obtaining non-repeating multimodal outputs with statistical accuracy was possible in the GAN model. However, the VAE model could only select a single answer equivalent to the average of a wide variety of outputs because it is trained based on minimization of the mean squared error between input and output. Moreover, the GAN model was able to produce non-repeating trajectories of unlimited length, using only finite trajectories for training. Accordingly, the GAN model can be used to generate an unlimited number of trajectories with a fixed length, which is advantageous.

            <span>Cannon, Danforth, Flint, Haggerty, and Mara were the pioneers of the laser pyrolysis synthesis technique.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit760"><sup><span class="sup_ref">760,761</span></sup></a> They first used it to synthesize, silicon, silicon carbide, and silicon nitride. They used silane as the silicon precursor. Because silane can absorb the energy of the laser at 10.6 μm, there was no need to use any additional photosensitizer. In addition, they added ethylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and methane (CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) to produce silicon carbide or ammonia (NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>) to produce silicon nitride. Both ethylene and ammonia could absorb the energy of the laser, while this was not possible for methane. In their set-up (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig103">Fig. 103</a>), the gaseous precursors were introduced through a stainless-steel nozzle with an inner diameter of 1.5 mm. They used an argon stream at 400 sccm as a sheath gas surrounding the precursor inlet, which served not only to confine the gaseous precursors in a small zone, but also to quench the hot products to stop particle growth and limit the particle size. Moreover, a stream of argon at 600 sccm was directed at the KCl windows through which the laser entered the reactor, to cool them and keep them clean. A mechanical pump and throttling valve were used to control the pressure in the system in the range of 1.17 to 14.50 psia. The energy source was a 150 W laser with unfocused intensities from 270 to 1020 W cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, from which focused intensities could reach 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> W cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. They synthesized highly-pure, monodispersed, spherical, and loosely agglomerated NPs with sizes in the range of 10 to 100 nm and an average crystallite size of about 15 nm (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig102">Fig. 102a</a>). Their production rates were about 1 g h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and a maximum of about 10 g of NPs was synthesized during a run of the reactor. Increasing the laser power led to production of crystalline silicon NPs rather than amorphous ones. Notably, the fully dense silicon NPs did not possess any surface or internal porosity and were extremely pure with oxygen content below 0.1 wt%. The silicon carbide and silicon nitride NPs were in the ranges of 18–26 and 10–25 nm, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit760"><sup><span class="sup_ref">760,761</span></sup></a></span>

The laser power was 60 W and the pressure of the reaction chamber was typically 8 psia. Reducing the operating pressure below atmospheric pressure decreased the average particle size.

            <p class="otherpara">Herlin-Boime's group also advanced the synthesis of silicon carbide NPs by laser pyrolysis. They used a mixture of silane (SiH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and ethylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>) as the precursors. Laser power was 600 W and the pressure was 14.31 psia. The production rate was 3.8 g h<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the average size of the synthesized particles was 16.6 nm. Notably, they increased the silane to ethylene ratio in the precursor solution above the stoichiometric ratio to incorporate a slight excess of silicon in the final product to facilitate dispersion of the NPs in water by the generation of surface Si–OH groups. In addition, they broke up agglomerates through magnetic stirring and wet ball-milling of the aqueous NP dispersion followed by slip-casting of slurries to obtain green bodies. They performed densification by spark plasma sintering at a pressure of 70 MPa which produced final densities of up to 96% of the theoretical full density.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit784"><sup><span class="sup_ref">784</span></sup></a> This group also synthesized uniformly carbon-coated silicon nanomaterials from the same precursors using a novel two-stage laser pyrolysis approach. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig106">Fig. 106</a> presents a schematic of their reactor. Silane (SiH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) was introduced to the first reaction zone to synthesize crystalline silicon NPs. They could control the size of silicon nanocrystals by adjusting the flow rate of helium as the diluting gas and focusing the laser. The silicon nanocrystals were delivered to the second reaction zone where the decomposition of ethylene (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>), injected after the first reaction zone, produced a carbon shell around the silicon nanocrystals. Notably, they adjusted the laser power between the two reaction zones in a way that ensured crystallinity of the silicon produced in the first zone while the remaining laser power was adequate to drive decomposition of the ethylene in the second zone. They saw no evidence of formation of silicon carbide at the interface of the core and shell. In addition, the synthesis in a single-step continuous process instead of a multi-step batch synthesis reduced the presence of silicon oxide in the final products, which in turn made the nanomaterials promising for lithium-ion battery anode applications. The carbon-coated silicon nanocomposites provided a high and stable capacity because of the protective effect of the carbon shell, which prevented direct contact of the silicon core with the electrolyte.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit782"><sup><span class="sup_ref">782</span></sup></a> In another study, they controlled the experimental conditions to synthesize the amorphous Si@C nanocomposites using the same strategy. Because the silicon nanocrystals used as an anode material were amorphized during the first charge/discharge cycle, which negatively impacted stability, the initially amorphous carbon-coated silicon nanocomposites provided more stable capacity. Notably, they created the carbon shell with a thickness of 1 nm, which was sufficient to prevent oxidation of the amorphous silicon core which is more easily oxidized than crystalline silicon. In doing so, they improved the properties of the nanocomposites for lithium-ion battery applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit783"><sup><span class="sup_ref">783</span></sup></a></p>

Further treatment under the same atmosphere at temperatures of 1400–1650 °C produced nanoplatelets with 10 to 50 graphitic layers and typical lateral dimensions of 50 nm, which were highly stable and remained unchanged for several months.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit763"><sup><span class="sup_ref">763</span></sup></a></span>
            <p class="otherpara">Rohani <span class="italic">et al.</span> used laser pyrolysis to create boron NPs for use in hydrogen generation by water-splitting (ideally, 2 B + 3 H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O → B<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> + 3 H<small><sub>2</sub></small>). Among water-reactive metals, boron has the highest theoretical specific capacity for hydrogen generation by reaction with water. To achieve complete reaction of boron, they needed highly-active boron NPs with high purity, small size, and high specific surface area, which can be produced by laser pyrolysis. They used diborane (B<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small>) as the precursor and SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> as the photosensitizer to generate boron NPs. The NPs were oxide free, amorphous, highly pure, air stable, and formed stable dispersion in water and alcohols. Because boron hydrolysis is not a spontaneous reaction, they needed an activator to launch the reaction. Among various possibilities tested, NaH was found to produce the greatest amount of hydrogen. The hydrogen generated by boron hydrolysis was used in a fuel cell, where its performance was very close to that of pure hydrogen from a compressed gas cylinder. Although in this case the total H<small><sub>2</sub></small> generation did not reach the theoretical stoichiometric limit, it exceeded the theoretical limit for competing materials including silicon and aluminum, and thus shows great promise.

Accordingly, they produced a stable ferrofluid of the sub-10 nm metal particles in aggregates of about 50 nm.

            <p class="otherpara">A laser pyrolysis synthesis of nickel NPs was presented by Swihart and coworkers. They used nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)<small><sub>4</sub></small>) as the main precursor. Although nickel carbonyl has a high vapor pressure and its decomposition will lead to the synthesis of pure nickel NPs, it is very toxic which limits its safe use as a gaseous precursor. To circumvent this issue, they used <span class="italic">in situ</span> generation of nickel carbonyl by flowing CO through hydrogen-regenerated nickel powder in a tube furnace. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig108">Fig. 108</a> presents a schematic of their experimental set-up. A helium gas stream was used as a sheath gas to confine the reaction zone. Because the nickel carbonyl cannot absorb the laser at 10.6 μm, a photosensitizer is necessary. Very high specific surface area NPs with a mean diameter of less than 10 nm are prone to oxidization upon exposure to air. Hence, larger particles were targeted to study the effects of parameters on the size and morphology. However, because smaller NPs with the size less than 10 nm have the most interesting magnetic behavior, they also synthesized smaller particles. The NPs were loosely agglomerated and dispersible in nonpolar solvents, but did not form long-term stable colloidal dispersions. They studied the effect of CO flow rate, inert gas, photosensitizer, and precursor concentration on the synthesis process. Additionally, they studied the magnetic properties of nickel NPs. They reported the flow rate of carbon monoxide changes the nickel carbonyl concentration, delivery rate, and flow patterns in the reactor.

            <span>In recent work, we have developed a low-cost ultrasonic atomizer that enabled us to spray any stable precursor solution into the reaction zone for the synthesis of nanomaterials with various compositions. A schematic of the ultrasonic atomizer is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig110">Fig. 110a</a>. We synthesized an array of zinc containing NPs including zinc oxide, pristine zinc sulfide, nitrogen-doped zinc sulfide, and zinc fluoride. To synthesize zinc oxide, zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>COO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·2H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) was dissolved in deionized water as the precursor solution. Because this precursor cannot absorb the energy of the laser, we introduced SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> as a photosensitizer. The uniform zinc oxide NPs had the wurtzite crystalline structure and sizes below 10 nm. Increasing the flow rate of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> and the laser power led to production of zinc fluoride NPs using the same precursor solution. Further tuning of the operating parameters led to formation of zinc fluoride NPs with two different morphologies: spherical and rod-like. To synthesize NPs with rod-like shape, we increased the laser power and the SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> flow rate compared to the conditions used to produce spherical NPs. In addition, the sheath gas used for the former case was hydrogen instead of nitrogen, which led to more rapid quenching because of its higher thermal conductivity. To synthesize pristine zinc sulfide, we added thioacetamide (CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>CSNH<small><sub>2</sub></small>) to the aqueous solution of zinc acetate dihydrate and sprayed it into the reaction zone, which led to production of zinc sulfide NPs with sphalerite crystalline structure and sizes below 10 nm, with a relatively narrow size distribution compared to the other vapor-phase synthesized nanomaterials. Adding thiourea (NH<small><sub>2</sub></small>CSNH<small><sub>2</sub></small>) instead of thioacetamide to the zinc acetate dihydrate aqueous solution resulted the formation of nitrogen-doped zinc sulfide NPs which had a narrower band gap compared to the pristine zinc sulfide, potentially extending their photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. By adjusting the operating parameters, we were able to synthesize nitrogen-doped zinc sulfide with different combinations of crystalline structures: sphalerite- and wurtzite-rich. Because the synthesis of the wurtzite crystalline structure requires higher temperature in the reaction zone compared to the synthesis of sphalerite, we increased the flow rate of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> and the laser power for this purpose. The relatively low vapor pressure of thiourea led to the formation of microspheres by a droplet-to-particle conversion mechanism rather than by gas-to-particle conversion as observed for the other materials. The morphologies of the various synthesized zinc-containing NPs are presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig110">Fig. 110b–g</a>.

            <span>Kruis <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a simple model to describe the evolution of particle size, morphology, and number concentration during simultaneous sintering and coagulation in an aerosol flow reactor that neglected the polydispersity of primary and aggregated NPs. They considered the effect of irregular/fractal structure on the collision kernel from the free molecular to the continuum regime. This simple model was in good agreement with a computationally-demanding two-dimensional sectional model for the aggregates with respect to both the specific surface area and the primary particle volume. They applied the model to the synthesis of silicon from silane (SiH<small><sub>4</sub></small>) in a laser pyrolysis reactor. They found that grain boundary diffusion was the main coalescence mechanism for the silicon NPs, based upon their theoretical evaluation of different sintering mechanisms. Moreover, the model showed that growth of primary particles through sintering was possible at temperatures well below the melting point. The results from the model were in reasonable agreement with experimental data for the primary particle sizes, suggesting that the sintering process was accurately represented. Notably, they accounted for the production of smaller and more aggregated silicon NPs produced by the laser pyrolysis based on the assumption that the outer boundaries of the laser-heated region were cooled and diluted by the surrounding unheated sheath gas.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit831"><sup><span class="sup_ref">831</span></sup></a></span>
            <p class="otherpara">Bomatí-Miguel <span class="italic">et al.</span> employed a simple coagulation model to simulate the synthesis of NPs by laser pyrolysis. The model had only the coagulation time as a tunable parameter. They considered the laser pyrolysis synthesis of iron NPs as a case study, for which they collected substantial experimental data. They applied the model to find operating conditions that maximized productivity as function of particle size. They found that the pressure and the carrier gas flow were the main factors determining productivity for larger NPs with mean diameter above 20 nm, while the vapor pressure of the precursor (temperature of delivery system) played the main role in determining productivity for smaller NPs with diameters below 20 nm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit832"><sup><span class="sup_ref">832</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Mwakikunga derived two equations to describe their experimental observations for the flame temperature trends based upon laser power and laser wavelength in laser pyrolysis synthesis using spray-based precursor delivery. They considered the thermal decomposition of tungsten ethoxide (C<small><sub>12</sub></small>H<small><sub>30</sub></small>O<small><sub>6</sub></small>W) and vanadium ethoxide (C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>15</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>V) aerosols through CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser pyrolysis as case studies. The first equation, to find the flame temperature trend as a function of laser power, was extended from the original Haggerty–Cannon energy balance equation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit833"><sup><span class="sup_ref">833</span></sup></a> The Haggerty–Cannon equation equates the energy absorbed from the laser beam to the total energies used to raise the aerosol temperature and initiate the chemical reactions plus energy losses through radiation, convection, and conduction. Based upon this equation, they concluded that the conversion of the precursors into product nanostructures was driven by a small fraction of the overall laser power, which was in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, they attempted to precisely identify the formation enthalpies and heat capacities through both modelling and experiment results, obtaining surprisingly low values of the heat capacities of the droplets, with ethanol as the solvent. This paper raises interesting questions about assumptions of thermal equilibrium during the laser pyrolysis process that merit further consideration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit834"><sup><span class="sup_ref">834</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Dang and Swihart developed a fully-coupled two-dimensional model to investigate the laser pyrolysis synthesis of silicon NPs from silane. The model included laser heating, fluid dynamics, gas phase and surface phase chemical reactions, and aerosol dynamics (NP transport and evolution through convection, diffusion, nucleation, surface growth, thermophoresis, and coagulation processes). They simulated the aerosol dynamics using a moment method, assuming a lognormal particle size distribution, and using a sectional model and compared the results from these two methods. They found that although only the sectional model was able to predict the local bimodal size distribution occurring at some points within the reactor, the moment method was able to predict the final product characteristics as well as the sectional method at much lower computational cost. They also performed a parametric study to find the influence of various operating parameters such as laser intensity, gas phase composition, inlet gas velocity, and the concentration of precursor on the final product characteristics. They observed that increasing the temperature of the reaction zone resulted in an increase in the size of the NPs as well as silane conversion. Also, increasing the inlet gas velocity led to a decrease in the size of NPs and silane conversion due to the shorter residence time in the hot zone of the reactor. Moreover, increasing the concentration of hydrogen reduced both gas phase and surface reaction rates. Accordingly, it reduced the rate of particles formation and thus had a similar effect to an increase in the gas inlet velocity. Furthermore, they investigated the effects of the interconnected mechanisms on the synthesis of NPs. They reported that variation in the reaction conditions for different pathways through the three-dimensional reactor domain played the main role in determining size polydispersity and creating non-lognormal overall size distributions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit835"><sup><span class="sup_ref">835</span></sup></a> In another study, they considered three sub-models to develop the simulation method: (i) They modeled the chemically reacting flow inside the reactor spatially with full geometric detail, without the consideration of aerosol dynamics, and with highly-simplified chemistry. (ii) Then, they employed an axisymmetric two-dimensional CFD model to describe the reaction zone, in which the results from the first step were used to find the boundary conditions. (iii) Finally, the synthesis of silicon NPs was investigated through a two-dimensional aerosol dynamics model by the consideration of more complete silane decomposition chemistry, along with the velocities and temperatures obtained from the second step. They employed a bivariate model to simulate the particle size evolution and morphology, and a moment model, based upon a lognormal particle volume distribution. Moreover, CFD simulation to incorporate the fluid dynamics data into the aerosol model made it appropriate for applications with complex reactor geometries. The model predicted that spherical NPs were generated at high temperature at the center of the reaction zone, followed by aggregation downstream of the reaction zone to generate non-spherical larger aggregates. In addition, they reported that thermophoresis plays a crucial role in the laser pyrolysis synthesis process because the small volume heated at the intersection of the laser beam and photosensitizer inlet stream resulted in steep temperature gradients.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit836"><sup><span class="sup_ref">836</span></sup></a> While most of these dynamics are similar to those observed in flame synthesis, the laser pyrolysis process combines some aspects of both a premixed flame, with energy deposition across the radius of the hot zone with aspects of a diffusion flame, with steep radial temperature gradients, and thus has some unique features.</p>

      <h2 id="sect11502"><span class="a_heading">3. Conclusions</span></h2>
      <span>In this review, we classified vapor-phase nanosynthesis methods into three categories based on the chemical similarity between the initial precursors and final products: (a) physically-based vapor-phase nanosynthesis methods in which the chemical structure of the initial precursors and final products are similar, including inert gas condensation, spark discharge generation, and pulsed laser ablation. These methods use direct heating, electrical discharges, intense laser light, or other methods to vaporize the precursor and then nucleate NPs of the same material or a simple compound of it. Generally, synthesis of highly-pure nanomaterials is the main benefit of these approaches and the limitations on the batch size or production rate per unit time are the major shortcomings of these approaches; (b) plasma processing nanosynthesis methods which can use precursors that are chemically similar to the final product, or molecular precursors that are quite different from the final product. Within this class, we distinguish between cases in which the precursors are injected into or downstream of a high-temperature plasma with thermal equilibrium between the electrons and ionized gas, and those using non-thermal plasmas in which the electrons have much higher temperatures than the ionized gas. In general, rapid heating and cooling rate in plasma is the main advantage of these approaches, while the need for complex equipment is the major barrier to broader use of these methods; (c) chemically-based vapor-phase nanosynthesis methods in which the initial precursors possess a different chemical structure compared to the final products include chemical vapor condensation, spray pyrolysis, flame-based aerosol synthesis, and laser pyrolysis. In each of these methods, a vapor or liquid droplets containing molecular (usually metalorganic or metal salt) precursors are decomposed following energy input, from furnace walls, a flame, or a laser. High production rate is a key advantage of many of these methods, while complex mechanisms and difficulty in achieving a high degree of purity can be limitations in these processes. In addition to the brief introduction of each method and the summarization of interesting nanomaterials produced using them, we described in detail some of the highest-impact studies that have been published about these methods, highlighting the corresponding applications of the nanomaterials produced.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Overall, although solution-phase methods of nanomaterial synthesis, including hydrothermal, solvothermal, sol–gel, and related processes play a dominant role in the scientific literature on nanomaterial synthesis, vapor-phase routes can provide a very fruitful alternative that can dramatically reduce the use of solvents and generation of waste, and that can be conducted in a steady-state continuous operation mode that is typical of industrial chemical processing. The present review aims to demonstrate the wide range of possibilities and of materials that can be prepared by these vapor-phase routes. While it is extensive, it is by no means comprehensive, and many more worthwhile studies have been published. For each synthesis route, and particularly for the more complex ones including plasma processes, flame processes, and laser-driven processes, there is much room remaining for both advances in fundamental understanding that will enable predictive modelling and scale-up, and for creative application to new materials and, especially, material combinations produced in a single-step continuous process.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Despite the decades of development described in this review, many opportunities for further advances in vapor-phase synthesis remain. Rapid advances in computer science and simulation methods, along with increasing computational power are improving our ability predict the formation of NPs in vapor-phase techniques using advanced modelling techniques. These advances move the field ever closer to the elusive ability to fully model industrial-scale processes that couple turbulent reactive flow and steep temperature and concentration gradients with NP nucleation, growth, aggregation, and coalescence, linking processes over many orders of magnitude in length and time scales. At the same time, new experimental developments are expanding the ability of researchers and practitioners to adopt these vapor-phase synthesis approaches. For example, we recently combined the ultrasonic atomization technique with laser pyrolysis to demonstrate a low-cost, green, and single-step route to synthesize fluorine-containing compounds with interesting properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit818"><sup><span class="sup_ref">818</span></sup></a> This is only a representative example of how the combination of techniques, in this case spray pyrolysis (using aerosol delivery of one precursor), CVC (using vapor-phase delivery of another precursor), and laser pyrolysis (using laser heating) can provide routes to synthesize new materials with interesting properties for existing and emerging applications. Similarly, advances in preparation of multi-component nanomaterials, particularly in the realm of catalysis, provide abundant opportunities for developing both materials and processes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31,837</span></sup></a> Multi-stage aerosol processes, like the two-stage laser pyrolysis method of Herlin-Boime and co-workers (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig106">Fig. 106</a>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit782"><sup><span class="sup_ref">782</span></sup></a> and the two-stage non-thermal plasma reactor of Mangolini and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit354"><sup><span class="sup_ref">354</span></sup></a> provide new opportunities to further tailor multicomponent materials in vapor-phase synthesis. Hard- and soft-templating strategies and ligand-capping strategies developed for solution-phase synthesis methods can be brought into the gas phase, particularly in spray pyrolysis and related methods that involve droplet-to-particle conversion. Numerous other combinations of synthesis techniques can similarly open up opportunities to produce new and interesting nanomaterials, and to economically scale up the production of these materials to achieve economical and societal impact.</p>
