wide variety of transition metal mediated and catalyzed reactions that can
be accomplished in air and water. Traditionally, these reactions have been
carried out in an organic solvent under an inert atmosphere. Li has
developed a novel [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction to generate 5-membered
carbocycles in water; a synthesis of beta-hydroxyl esters in water; a
chemoselective allylation and pinacol coupling reaction mediated by
manganese in water; and a novel alkylation of 1,3-dicarbonyl type compounds
in water. In addition, a number of Barbierâ€“Grignard type reactions in
water have been developed. Water offers many advantages as a solvent. Water
is readily available and inexpensive, and is not flammable, explosive, or
toxic.</span><p class="otherpara">Protection/deprotection steps can be avoided, and products may be
isolated by simple phase separation rather than by energy-intensive and
organic-emitting processes involving distillation of organic solvent.
Several reactions also demonstrate unprecedented chemoselectivity that
eliminates byproduct formation and separation. The open-air feature offers
convenience in operations of chemical synthesis involving small-scale
combinatorial synthesis, large-scale manufacturing, and catalyst recycling.
The catalytic reactions developed by Professor Li have widespread
applications in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals,
petrochemicals, agricultural chemicals, polymers and plastics. Through his
development of transition metal mediated and catalyzed reactions in air and
water, Professor Li provides an attractive alternative to the inert
atmosphere and organic solvents traditionally used in many synthetic
reactions. <span class="italic">For more information on the work of Professor Li see

technology that, when applied to crops, increases plant biomass,
photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and root development, and ultimately leads
to greater crop yield and quality. Harpins are nontoxic, naturally
occurring proteins that trigger a plantâ€™s natural defence systems to
protect against disease and pests and simultaneously activate certain plant
growth systems without altering the plantâ€™s DNA. EDEN discovered that
once a harpin protein binds to a receptor molecule on the plant surface,
several biochemical events are induced. First, production of hydrogen
peroxide, an important mechanism of plant defense, is induced in plant
cells, followed by stimulation of a series of ion exchanges in the cell
membrane. A series of signal transduction events leads to several
beneficial plant responses. The result of this technology is an EPA-
approved product called Messenger<small><sup>Â®</sup></small>, that has been
demonstrated on more than 40 crops to effectively stimulate plants to
defend themselves against a broad spectrum of viral, fungal, and bacterial
diseases, including some for which there currently is no effective
treatment. In addition, Messenger<small><sup>Â®</sup></small> has been shown through an
extensive safety evaluation to have virtually no adverse effect on any of
the organisms tested, including mammals, birds, honey bees, plants, fish,
aquatic invertebrates and algae. In addition, harpin-based products are
produced in a water-based fermentation system that uses no harsh solvents
or reagents, requires only modest energy inputs, and generates no hazardous
chemical wastes. As with most proteins, harpin is a fragile molecule that
is degraded rapidly by UV and natural microorganisms and has no potential
to bioaccumulate or to contaminate surface or groundwater resources. Using
environmentally benign harpin protein technology, growers for the first
time in the history of modern agriculture will be able to harness the
innate defence and growth systems of crops to substantially enhance yields,
improve crop quality, and reduce reliance on conventional agricultural
chemicals. <span class="italic">For more information on Eden Biosciences and MessengerÂ®

biodegradable chelating agent. Most classic chelating agents are poorly
biodegradable; some are quite persistent and have been detected in the
surface waters of rivers and lakes and in make-up water processed for
drinking water. Bayer Corporation manufactures a readily biodegradable and
environmentally friendly chelating agent,
<span class="small_caps">DL</span>-aspartic-<span class="italic">N</span>-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl) tetrasodium salt, an
aminocarboxylate also known as sodium iminodisuccinate. This agent is
characterized by excellent chelation capabilities, especially for
iron(<span class="small_caps">III</span>), copper(<span class="small_caps">II</span>), and calcium, and is both
readily biodegradable and benign from a toxicological and ecotoxicological
standpoint. It is also produced by a 100% waste-free and environmentally
friendly manufacturing process. Nearly all aminocarboxylates in use today
are acetic acid derivatives produced from amines, formaldehyde, sodium
hydroxide, and hydrogen cyanide. The industrial use of thousands of tons of
hydrogen cyanide is an extreme toxicity hazard. In contrast, Bayerâ€™s
sodium iminodisuccinate is produced from maleic anhydride (a raw material
also produced by Bayer), water, sodium hydroxide, and ammonia. The only
solvent used in the production process is water, and the only side product
formed, ammonia dissolved in water, is recycled back into sodium
iminodisuccinate production or used in other Bayer processes. Because
sodium iminodisuccinate is a readily biodegradable, non-toxic, and
non-polluting alternative to other chelating agents, it can be used in a
variety of applications that employ chelating agents, including detergents,
agricultural nutrients, and household and industrial cleaners. <span class="italic">For more

process for treating cotton textiles that provides an economical and
environmentally friendly alternative to alkaline scour systems currently
used in the textile industry today. Conventional chemical preparation
processes involve treatment of the cotton substrate with hot solutions of
sodium hydroxide, chelating agents, and surface active agents, often
followed by a neutralization step with acetic acid. This series of various
treatments and rinsing steps generates large volumes of wastes, including
large amounts of salts, acids, and alkali. The BioPreparationâ„¢
technology developed by Novozymes is an alternative to sodium hydroxide
that offers many advantages for textile wet processing, including reduced
BOD/COD, and decreased water use. Pectate lyase is the main scouring agent
that degrades pectin to release the entangled waxes and other contaminants
from the cotton surface. This enzyme is also compatible with other
enzymatic preparations (amylases, cellulases) used to improve the
performance properties of cotton fabrics. Because BioPreparationâ„¢
uses fewer chemicals and rinsing steps than required during a traditional
caustic scour, textile mills may save as much as 30â€“50% in water
costs by replacing caustic scours or by combining the usually separate
scouring and dyeing steps into one. A recent statistical survey determined
that 162 knitting mills used 89 million m<small><sup>3 </sup></small>per year of water in
processing goods from scouring to finishing; the BioPreparationâ„¢
approach would save from 27 to 45 million m<small><sup>3</sup></small> per year of water.
In addition, field trials established that BOD and COD loads are decreased
by 25 and 40%, respectively, when compared to conventional sodium hydroxide
treatments. Furthermore, costs savings of 30% or more per mill can be
realized. <span class="italic">For more information on Novozymes North America and

as a substitute for lead in cationic electrocoatings without any sacrifice
in corrosion performance. Although much less studied that lead, the
available data on yttrium indicate orders of magnitude lower hazard. As a
dust hazard, yttrium is 100 times safer than lead at typical levels of use.
In electrocoat applications, yttrium is twice as effective as lead on a
weight basis, allowing the formulation of commercial coatings that contain
half the yttrium by weight relative to lead in comparably performing
lead-containing products. It has been found that yttrium is deposited as
the hydroxide in an electrocoat, then converted to the oxide during normal
baking of the electrocoat. The oxide is extraordinarily non-toxic by
ingestion as indicated by the LD<small><sub>50</sub></small> of &gt;10 g
kg<small><sup>â€“1</sup></small> in rats, which is in stark contrast to lead. The
ubiquitous nature of yttrium in the environment and the insoluble
ceramic-like nature of the oxide combine to make it an unlikely cause of
future environmental or health problems. An environmental side benefit of
yttrium is its performance over low nickel and chrome-free metal
pretreatments. By using yttrium in the electrocoat step, chrome can be
completely eliminated using standard chrome-free rinses and low nickel or
possibly nickel-free pretreatments, both of which are commercially
available today. For PPG pretreatment customers, this should result in the
elimination of up to 25,000 lb of chrome and 50,000 lb of nickel (annually)
from PPG products. As PPG customers implement yttrium over the next several
years, approximately one million lb of lead (as lead metal) will be removed
from the electrocoat applications of PPG automotive customers. <span class="italic">For more

Laboratory of Applied Thermodynamics and Phase Equilibria, at Delft
University of Technology in The Netherlands<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">â€ </a>
 present a thermodynamic argument that our society should develop to become
a metabolic society,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2</span></sup></a> involving more
efficient conversion and disposal of energy and material. Most living
systems fulfill the requirements of a metabolic society, directly (plants)
or indirectly (animals).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> The notorious
exception is man as from the moment that he got involved in what is called
â€˜the industrial societyâ€™. How can this unfortunate exception be
repaired?</p><h2 id="sect363"><span class="a_heading">Introduction</span></h2><span>The 20th century showed the full development of an industrial society
characterized by mass production, mass consumption and mass waste
disposal.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> For many countries this has
produced prosperity and an unprecedented economic growth with, in many
respects, an improved quality of life. But gradually less attractive
consequences of this development became apparent, like the dependency on
fossil fuels and the impact on the environment that seem to have taken
global proportions. So on the way to the 21st century we began to realize
that this posed us for a Trilemma, where we are challenged to devise a way
to harmonize economic growth, resource supply and preservation of the
environment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a></span><p class="otherpara">Prominent representatives of industry, government and academia,
recognizing this Trilemma, therefore have called for â€˜sustainable
developmentâ€™, often with a less precise description albeit with the
best of intentions. Sawa for example proposes that the 21st century should
see the development of a post-industrial society,<span class="italic"> the metabolic
society</span>, characterized by viable consumption levels, limited waste,
active recycling, energy savings and longer product lives.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> This is a very interesting proposal and we felt
the need to try and identify the characteristics of such a society.
Therefore we have turned to living systems and identified some of their
basic requirements with regard to the conversion of energy and
matter.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> Next we tried to analyze the way we
â€˜manage our houseâ€™ by starting from a simple economic picture
and by extending it to what we believe is a picture of a self-sustaining,
rather than of a self-exhausting society. Finally we present a perspective
of the global industrial society from how it is to how it should
develop.</p><h2 id="sect372"><span class="a_heading">The metabolic society</span></h2><span>When Sawa launched the term â€˜metabolic societyâ€™ he may have
had in mind a society that lives in dynamic equilibrium with its
environment, producing enough food and materials to sustain its passive and
active life and absorbing in a natural way all its waste produced, like a
cow living on a pasture of sufficient area, the total system powered by the
sun. This is what many believe to be a sustainable society. Angela Merkel,
physicist and former German Minister of the Environment defines sustainable
development as â€˜Using resources no faster than they can regenerate
themselves and releasing pollutants to no greater extent than natural
resources can assimilate themâ€™.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> This
was of course the situation before the industrial revolution and man fitted
quite nicely in such a society. But then he got engaged in the industrial
society, and by doing so stepped out of the metabolic society. A point was
reached that â€˜nature could not keep up with us any longerâ€™, as
Yoda puts it.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a></span><p class="otherpara">Morowitz has summarized some characteristics of living systems.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> They prevail in a permanent non-equilibrium with
respect to their environment. This state is sustained by a permanent energy
source. They display structure and prevail in an active or passive mode.
The energy source needs a sink for disposal of its degraded form, while
stripping energy from its useful part requires at least one material cycle.
<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> shows schematically the metabolic
society. Radiation from the sun is stripped from its useful component and
transformed into mechanical, electrical or chemical energy. Overall, solar
radiation is converted into the same amount of useless heat to the
environment while sustaining a structured, non-equilibrium system of plants
and animals, requiring at least one material cycle of synthesis and
respiration involving CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and O<small><sub>2</sub></small>. In
this cycle the smallest living systems, the microbes, are most numerous and
essential. They keep matter in cycles and are also responsible for the
final degradation step to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, thus assuring
â€˜wasteâ€™ disposal.</p><br/><div class="image_table"><table><tr><td colspan="3" class="imgHolder" id="imgfig1"><img alt="figure, filename = b105777b-f1.gif" src="/image/article/2001/GC/b105777b/b105777b-f1.gif"/></td></tr><tr><td class="pushTitleRight"> </td><td class="image_title"><b>Fig. 1</b></td><td class="pushTitleLeft"> </td></tr></table></div><h2 id="sect386"><span class="a_heading">The industrial society</span></h2><span>Ecology is the study and economy in the management of â€˜the

economics in which capital, production and consumption stand out. However
environmental economists pointed to what is missing in this picture: the
environment. In thermodynamics we know all too well that we should always

environmental economists emphasize the importance of the interaction with
the environment <span class="italic">via</span> extraction and emission (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3b</a>). This picture expresses somehow the less
favourable aspects of an industrial society. Ishikawa condemns this by

resourcesâ€™.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6 </span></sup></a>In this respect the
industrial society is markedly different from the metabolic society and

that take place in time and allows some important observations. First and
foremost it visualizes the first and second law. Although energy is
conserved, its quality, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> its available work content,
diminishes and finally disappears while the amount of lost work increases
in time. Secondly it makes us aware that a material resource of energy has
depleted and that its transformation is accompanied by emissions due to the
law of mass conservation: mass stored underground and mass extracted from
the atmosphere are transformed and sent into the atmosphere. Thirdly the
application, electricity consumption, does not need a material source of
energy. An immaterial source of energy as solar radiation can also provide
electricity. Finally, if we make a life cycle analysis of this process, we
notice that the process is not a closed cycle.</p><br/><div class="image_table"><table><tr><td colspan="3" class="imgHolder" id="imgfig4"><img alt="figure, filename = b105777b-f4.gif" src="/image/article/2001/GC/b105777b/b105777b-f4.gif"/></td></tr><tr><td class="pushTitleRight"> </td><td class="image_title"><b>Fig. 4</b></td><td class="pushTitleLeft"> </td></tr></table></div><p class="otherpara"><a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a> tries to picture that the work

transesterification process to turn used chip pan fat into perfectly
functional biodiesel. In fact he has successfully run his Volvo car on his
biodiesel fuel (produced in his Manchester back garden) for over 18,000
miles. The car engine was examined after 15,000 miles and was found to be
virtually corrosion and carbon deposit free. This proves the validity of
the fuel, and at a small scale production cost of 12p per litre it would
appear to be competitive with regular diesel. The major problem arises when
Customs and Excise demand he pays around 50p per litre in road fuel tax.
Mr. Steele comments on this by saying â€˜The Government talks about
saving the environment and cutting down on emissions, buttaxes biodiesel at
the highest rate in the world. Itâ€™s daft!â€™ He also claims that
the problem arises from a â€˜wrong calculationâ€™ by MAFF in a
report to the government back in 1996 â€˜One wrong figure in the report
has set biodiesel production in the UK back by 5 yearsâ€™. Furthermore,
Mr. Steele attacks the UK Government on the subject of road tax â€˜The
Chancellor last year took Â£55 off road tax on small cars with no
measurable benefit in terms of greenhouse gas savings. That cost the
Exchequer Â£110 million. For the same amount of cash, we could have a
brand new biodiesel industry in the UK, creating 2000 new jobs. It would
have supported the production of 500 million litres of biodiesel, saving in
round terms, half a million tonnes of carbon emissionsâ€™.</span><p class="otherpara">Mr. Steele continues his campaign to have the duty on biodiesel reduced.

It is not a new fuel; in fact Rudolf Diesel ran his original engine on
peanut oil in 1900. The reason why people are not familiar with biodiesel
is that because mineral oil derived diesel has been cheaper and more
available for the majority of this century. The oil crisis in 1973
reawakened interest in biofuels when mineral oil prices skyrocketed. Now,
even though the oil prices have fallen again the interest in biofuels has
not diminished due to the environmental advantages of biodiesel.</span><p class="otherpara">Biodiesel is quite simply a fuel made from vegetable oil. More precisely
it is defined as the mono alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived
from renewable lipid sources. The processing required to produce biodiesel
is minimal, firstly oil has to be extracted from the crop and secondly a
very simple chemical modification of the oil has to be carried out.
Biodiesel can be used in an unmodified diesel engine as either pure
biodiesel or as a mixture of biodiesel and conventional mineral oil based
diesel. A tractor fuelled by biodiesel derived from sunflower oil has been

diesel. Perhaps first and foremost is the fact that biodiesel is neutral
with regard to carbon dioxide (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) emissions and consequently
it does not add to global warming. This is in stark contrast to
conventional diesel, which produces three tonnes of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for
every tonne of diesel burnt. Biodiesel is also non-toxic (less toxic than
table salt according to the EPA) and degrades quickly in the environment
leaving innocuous products. Unlike mineral oil diesel, biodiesel has a
negligible sulfur content and consequently it does not add to acid rain.
Biodiesel is a much better lubricant than conventional diesel fuel and
extends engine lifeâ€”a German truck won an entry in the Guinness Book
of Records by travelling more than 1.25 million km (780,000 miles) on
biodiesel with its original engine.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a>
Biodiesel is also the only alternative fuel to have passed the stringent
health effects testing requirements of the US Clean Air Acts Amendments of
1990.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a></p><h2 id="sect560"><span class="a_heading">Methods of producing biodiese</span></h2><span>Vegetable oils can be used directly as diesel fuels, but the inherent
viscosity of the oils is often a problem. This can be solved by the
formation of micro-emulsions with solvents such as methanol and ethanol.
However, neat vegetable oils and the emulsions both cause coking and valve
blocking in engines due to problems deriving from oil deterioration and
incomplete combustion.</span><p class="otherpara">The most widespread method for production of biodiesel is through a
transesterification process. Natural fats and oils exist as glycerides, a
triester of fatty acid and glycerol, which are naturally viscous by nature.
The transesterification process involves the reaction of a fat or oil with
an alcohol to form esters and glycerol (both of which are commercially
saleable products).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> A general reaction is

Because the reaction is reversible, excess alcohol is used to shift the
equilibrium to the product side (the alcohol is recycled). Methanol is the
most commonly used alcohol because of its low cost and physical and
chemical advantages (polar, shortest chain alcohol and sodium hydroxide, a
basic catalyst, is soluble in it).</p><p class="otherpara">The ratio of alcohol to glyceride required for reaction is dependent on
whether the reaction is catalysed by acid or base. An acid catalysed
reaction needs a ratio of 30âˆ¶1, whereas a base catalysed reaction
(<span class="italic">ca.</span> 1% w/w for both acid and base) requires a ratio of 6âˆ¶1.
A major point is that the base catalysed system is intolerant to water
content in the vegetable oil, whereas acid catalysis can tolerate water.
Enzyme catalysts have also been used.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a></p><p class="otherpara">A typical continuous reactor used in the production of biodiesel from

reduction target (Kyoto agreement). Specific legislation to promote and
regulate the use of biodiesel is in force in various countries (including
Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden). Europe currently produces
700,000 tonnes/year of biodiesel and has set production targets of 2.3
Mtonnes by 2003 and 8.3 Mtonnes by 2010 to reduce greenhouse and air
polluting gas emissions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> Germany is on

their usage of biodiesel:<br/><br/><span class="text_indent">â€¢â€‚Germany has been producing biodiesel since 1992, does not
tax the fuel and has plans for an annual production of 400,000 tonnes.
There are over 700 filling stations in Germany selling biodiesel. </span><br/><span class="text_indent">â€¢â€‚Many French towns have buses running on a mixture of
biodiesel and fossil diesel. It is distributed, amongst others by Elf and
Total. In fact most fossil fuel diesel in France is mixed with biodiesel
today.</span><br/><span class="text_indent">â€¢â€‚In Sweden it is sold in a mixture with fossil diesel.
Also in Stockholm they have greatly cut pollution by using ethanol as a

CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions. The Governments Climate Change Programme sets out
an ambitious package of measures across all sectors, which is expected to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 23% by 2010 relative to 1990. This will
include a substantial reduction in the use of carbon rich fuels in the
transport sector. In the UK over 500,000 ha of land are set aside yearly;
it is feasible that much of this land could be used for oilseed rape
production. Surprisingly, much of the oilseed rape production in the UK is
actually used in other European states.</span><p class="otherpara">Biodiesel has been tested by several organisations in the UK, all of
which demonstrated the suitability of biodiesel for general use. In the
most recent budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, announced
that biodiesel would qualify for a 20p per litre tax rebate. This will mean
a tax on biodiesel of about 25p per litre to come into effect after
approximately one year. Although this was widely considered a step in the
right direction pressure groups have indicated that they would prefer the
duty on biodiesel to be more like 10p per litre (in some EU countries there
is no duty on biodiesel). With a reasonable duty on biodiesel it is
predicted that farming industry could provide between 5 and 10% of the UK
diesel needs over the coming years.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a></p><h2 id="sect595"><span class="a_heading">The future</span></h2><span>The UK is perceived within the EU as dragging its heels behind the
biodiesel programmes in other member states. However slowly, it seems that
the political mood is changing, with recent announcements of the lowering
of the fuel duty on biodiesel and other more positive signs regarding
future use of biofuels.</span><p class="otherpara">The amount of farmland set aside yearly could be used to grow crops such
as oilseed rape. Through calculation it has been estimated that up to 10%
of the UKâ€™s diesel consumption could be accounted for by biodiesel
derived from homegrown crops, which is a significant amount in terms of
saving fossil fuels and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions.</p><span id="sect601"><h2 id="sect600"><span class="a_heading">References</span></h2></span><ol type="1"><li><span id="cit9">http://www.newtonrigg.ac.uk/agric_ forestry/millennium.html.</span></li><li><span id="cit10">http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel.html.</span></li><li><span id="cit11">http://www.biofuels.fsnet.co.uk/.</span></li><li><span id="cit12">D.

the impetus for many chemical companies to look again at how much energy is
used on site. The chemical sector has now finalised the Negotiated
Agreement with the Government and this means that chemical companies will
benefit from an 80% discount on the CCL. However, to retain this discount
in future years, chemical companies must make the agreed energy
savings.</span><p class="otherpara">As many chemical manufacturing organisations are re-launching their
energy management strategies, there is an increasing requirement for
support and guidance. Managers must use both time and financial resources
as effectively as possible and energy management should now be part of any
good management system. Energy and utility costs are frequently viewed as
an â€˜overheadâ€™ but they are actually a controllable cost. As
with any commodity, energy cannot be managed effectively unless it can be
closely measured. It is not enough to just have a meter at the site
boundary. Fortunately larger companies, with sites that have several plants
and other buildings, have extra meters for cost allocation purposes. This
data can be used as a key part of the energy management process.</p><p class="otherpara">Energy management is also not just about one person doing all the work.
It is important to educate the whole workforce, starting at management
level. Information is the key. Making sure everyone gets the message will
make the energy managerâ€™s job a lot easier. There is a host of
information available within the Governmentâ€™s Energy Efficiency Best
Practice Programme (EEBPP), to help energy managers make the best use of
energy inputs. The EEBPP is pioneering a new scheme that will provide
specific support to larger chemical manufacturing sites. This takes the
form of â€˜Partnershipsâ€™ between the site and EEBPP, who provide
energy audits, training seminars, literature and technical help. The
partnership approach is based on discussions between the site and
specialists from the EEBPP who ensure that the events are â€˜tailor
madeâ€™ to suit the siteâ€™s specific requirements. This advice,
when combined with the companyâ€™s own expertise, turns potential
energy savings into improved profits as well as reducing environmental
impact.</p><h2 id="sect708"><span class="a_heading">Solutia takes free advice</span></h2><span>Solutia UK Ltd. operates a chemical manufacturing plant at Newport,
South Wales, with seven production plants using organic and/or inorganic
processes. Techniques used at the plant include pyrolysis, esterfication
and hydrogenation, and the plant operates on a 24-hour shift pattern. The
company produces several chemicals such as organic phosphonates, rubber
chemicals, phosphate esters and a plasticiser used as the safety interlayer
in car windscreens. Solutia recognised that there was plenty of scope for
energy reductions at its Newport site. So, the company called on the EEBPP
to help them form an energy management team and disseminate the necessary
information factory-wide.<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10"/></span><br/><div class="image_table"><table><tr><td colspan="3" class="imgHolder" id="imgfig10"><img alt="Solutia, a chemical company working for energy efficiency." src="/image/article/2001/GC/b105777b/b105777b-f10.gif"/></td></tr><tr><td class="pushTitleRight"> </td><td class="image_title"><b>Fig. 10 </b> <span id="fig10"><span class="graphic_title"><span>Solutia, a chemical company working for energy efficiency.</span></span></span></td><td class="pushTitleLeft"> </td></tr></table></div><p class="otherpara">David Lloyd, an EEBPP energy consultant worked with Solutia and created
a tailor made programme of talks and discussions. â€˜Since the seminar
in December, with full attendance of a wide cross section of personnel, we
have initiated an Energy Steering Group. The first meeting has been held
and over 180 items have been prioritised for investigation or
action,â€™ Keith Agnew, who heads the group, explained. He is
encouraged to have such a wide cross- section of support.</p><p class="otherpara">The Steering Group has drawn up a long-term plan and set a timescale for
actions. â€˜Following the seminar, I have ensured that energy
efficiency is an area that appears in each line production managerâ€™s
goals,â€™ said Keith Agnew. â€˜This is not a one-off event, though,
we must deliver energy reductions year-on-year, and make sure we have
continuous sustainable improvementâ€™. Keith Agnew is encouraged that
managers are so willing to take the energy efficiency message on board.
â€˜Solutia greatly values the EEBPPâ€™s support and guidance,
especially after the success of the seminar last December,â€™ he
said.</p><p class="otherpara">Solutia created an inventory and database of the 506 motors in use on
site, and defined a motors strategy. As a result, the company will either
rewind or replace motors at the appropriate time. If motors are over sized,
they will be replaced with a smaller motor. Process optimisation is also an
important factor and some improvements were identified. However, as major
changes were made a few years ago, the potential for further savings is not
as great as in other areas, such as reducing the amount of compressed air
used on site.</p><p class="otherpara">Solutia uses a large amount of compressed air and the Energy Steering
Group carried out a basic leak survey at the end of 2000. The leak rate for
the site was considered to be the industry average, and the industry
average is high. This means that any energy used to produce leaked
compressed air is wasted. â€˜To date Â£60,000 per year of leaks
have been identified and the majority have been fixed, with the remainder
in a plan to address them when there is an opportunity,â€™ said Keith.
â€˜It is important to keep up general good housekeeping measures of
tightening valves and turning the air supply off when not in use. We must
be able to sustain this improvement into the future,â€™ he said.</p><p class="otherpara">The benefits of having a company-wide Energy Steering Group cannot be
over-emphasised. Having managers from all areas gives a true site
perspective. Savings that can be made in one place may have cost
implications elsewhere. It is important to be able to consider all these
aspects together and to have everyone involved. Having gained the
commitment of the management team, Keith is now very keen to get the
message across to all site staff. â€˜This year I will be creating a
special topic for line manager meetings that will raise awareness and the
importance to us all of energy efficiency. Ultimately, I would like to
think we could have 250 energy managers here at Solutia,â€™ he
said.</p><p class="otherpara">The EEBPP is able to help chemical companies set up an energy management
strategy and support managers in implementing it. Free site-specific advice
