To that goal, hydrogen is presumed to be the most promising energy carrier. Electrocatalytic water splitting, if driven by green electricity, would provide hydrogen with minimal CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> footprint. The viability of water electrolysis still hinges on the availability of durable earth-abundant electrocatalyst materials and the overall process efficiency. This review spans from the fundamentals of electrocatalytically initiated water splitting to the very latest scientific findings from university and institutional research, also covering specifications and special features of the current industrial processes and those processes currently being tested in large-scale applications. Recently developed strategies are described for the optimisation and discovery of active and durable materials for electrodes that ever-increasingly harness first-principles calculations and machine learning. In addition, a technoeconomic analysis of water electrolysis is included that allows an assessment of the extent to which a large-scale implementation of water splitting can help to combat climate change. This review article is intended to cross-pollinate and strengthen efforts from fundamental understanding to technical implementation and to improve the ‘junctions’ between the field's physical chemists, materials scientists and engineers, as well as stimulate much-needed exchange among these groups on challenges encountered in the different domains.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2022/CS/d0cs01079k/d0cs01079k-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: d0cs01079k-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2022/CS/d0cs01079k/d0cs01079k-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

      <p class="otherpara">Besides alkaline water electrolyser (AWE),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> proton-exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> (PEMWE) and most recently anion-exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> (AEMWE) are currently well-developed and commercially available. Section 3 gives an overview of the water electrolyser technologies. Unlike AWE, PEMWE is compatible with frequent changes of the current load, a crucial characteristic when converting energy from a renewable source of electricity. All these technologies have their advantages and disadvantages, and the challenges for reducing the costs of produced hydrogen really are technology-depending. The membrane material represents an enormous cost driver for PEM technology;however, for PEMWE developing earth-abundant, durable electrode materials capable of replacing noble electrodes is currently the most effective way to reduce capital costs (capital expenditure, CAPEX). For AEMWE electrolysers, the maintenance costs caused by the poor stability of the membranes are the main cost factor. To bring clarity here, the different approaches are compared based on a (in-depth) techno-economic and SWOT (Strengths, Weakness Opportunities, and Threats) analysis (Sections 4 and 14), while Section 5 focuses on the materials of these water electrolysers’ technologies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The usefulness of electrocatalytically-driven H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/O<small><sub>2</sub></small> production stands and falls with complementary properties that must be met by the electrolyzer system. The efficiency, the rate and the stability of the system and its core materials are pivotal to its practical implementation. From an engineering standpoint, a system operated at a low overpotential (and low rate) would exhibit a high efficiency (low operating cost), combined with a low productivity (little hydrogen production in comparison to the total cost of the construction: high capital cost), maintenance and operation of the system, so that it will not always be economically competitive. On the contrary, a system running at higher rate (and a lower efficiency), could be more economically-viable per produced kg of hydrogen. In addition, the system stability must be considered, as long-lasting electrodes would enable to lower the maintainence/replacement costs. So, it is not only the electrodes/electrocatalysts’ efficiency which drive the electrolyser's practicability. However, one can admit that more efficient electrodes/electrocatalysts are still desperately needed; the electrocatalytic efficiency is directly determined by the overpotentials (<span class="italic">η</span>) occurring on both half-cell sides.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22,23</span></sup></a> It is therefore not surprising that optimisation of hydrogen-evolving and oxygen-evolving electrodes remains a hard-fought battlefield on which scientists and engineers currently cavort.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Especially of interest is the development of OER electrodes that consist of cheap, non-noble earth-abundant elements capable of replacing the noble, rarely occurring components such as iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), or ruthenium (Ru) known to be highly active oxygen evolving electrodes. We would like to point out here that the periphery of the as-prepared electrode, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the as prepared catalyst, is usually not identical with the active catalytic surface that is formed under operation. Today's materials discovery strategies based on first-principles calculations (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, DFT), machine learning, and optimisation approaches (<span class="italic">aka</span> the materials-by-design approach) for reducing the overpotential for metal-based and metal-free OER and HER electrocatalysts are evaluated in Sections 6–8.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">For a general assessment of the quality of water electrolysis electrodes, it is not enough to consider only the pure electrocatalytic performance of the materials from which the electrodes are made. The number of active sites and the activity of the active site (the latter being defined as the intrinsic catalyst activity<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a>) of the exploited materials play a major role in terms of the overall catalyst's performance and are influenced by particle size,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> by engineering catalyst morphology,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> and by surface reconstruction into more active site species.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27–31</span></sup></a> For tailored electrocatalytic properties and advantageous mass-transfer behaviour, optimised electrode preparation techniques and options for post-treatment of electrode materials and ready-to-use electrodes are essential (Section 9).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Water-splitting approaches that can be classified as being heterogenous catalysis are the most promising. Molecular catalysts originally intended to support photocatalytic water-splitting are also gradually implemented in water electrocatalysis (heterogenisation of molecular catalysts). Metal complexes can help not only in the understanding of the sequential steps of water oxidation but also have promise for their putative integration in functional devices, particularly for the hydrogen production reaction<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> (Section 10).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A knowledge-based optimisation of electrodes would have been impossible without the development of ever finer characterisation methods, some of which being applied under potential control (<span class="italic">i.e. in situ</span> or even <span class="italic">operando</span>). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) analysis helped to understand the characteristics that affect OER activity and are therefore vital for determining the OER mechanism and developing OER electrocatalysts. Often catalysts that appeared to be initially promising have failed when used at conditions approaching normal industrial operation. To evaluate the value of electrode materials or complete water-splitting devices in terms of practical application, intensive <span class="italic">ex situ</span>/<span class="italic">in situ</span> testing and durability (long-term) testing under conditions ranging from classical laboratory operating settings (current density loads, temperature, load change behaviour) to industrial settings are an indispensable prerequisite.

      <p class="otherpara">In order to avoid expensive pre-treatment of the water (depending on country specifications), the electrolyser technology must be adaptable to the water that is directly available in nature.

Problematic ingredients of water from the sea, lakes, and rivers as well as wastewater pose major challenges for electrodes and membranes. This research field is addressed in Section 13, while market and cost issues are focused on in Section 14.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Water splitting is a research field of activity that is developing at breath-taking speed. Consequently, the number of papers that can be assigned to water splitting published per time has increased dramatically. This area of research must not lose sight of a critical review of the research approaches. The authors try at every point in the article to identify opportunities in approaches – including around basic research such as electrode development, approaches to developing theoretical explanations, and the technical implementation of newer research approaches – and perhaps even to uncover possible wrong turns.</p>
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect1055"><span class="a_heading">2 Basic concepts in OER and HER electrocatalysis</span></h2>
      <span>A typical water electrolyser comprises three (main) components: an electrolyte, a cathode, and an anode. Energy supplied with an externally generated voltage that must exceed the equilibrium voltage of water splitting, decomposes water molecules into hydrogen gas in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen gas in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. The net reaction of water electrolysis is 2H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O → 2H<small><sub>2</sub></small> + O<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The standard equilibrium voltage of the water electrolysis cell is <span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>0</sub></small> = 1.229 V (at <span class="italic">T</span> = 298 K, <span class="italic">P</span> = 1 atm and pH 0). It is related to the standard reaction Gibbs energy by the well-known relation Δ<span class="italic">G</span><small><sup>0</sup></small><small><sub>R</sub></small> = −<span class="italic">nFU</span><small><sub>0</sub></small>, with the Faraday constant <span class="italic">F</span> = 96<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>485 C mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the number of electrons converted per H<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecule, <span class="italic">n</span> = 2.

When conditions deviate from the standard conditions, the equilibrium voltage, <span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>eq</sub></small> is determined by <span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>0</sub></small> and an additional term that generally depends on the temperature as well concentrations, activities or partial pressures of reactant and product species, as described by the Nernst equation. In order to achieve a certain decomposition rate (current density) the cell voltage <span class="italic">U</span> should exceed the equilibrium voltage (<span class="italic">U</span> &gt; <span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>eq</sub></small>). Because of the sluggishness of the OER, a significant departure (<span class="italic">U</span> − <span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>eq</sub></small> &gt; 0.5 V) is required in order to attain technically relevant current densities on the order of 0.3 to 10 A cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, depending on the water electrolysis technology employed.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The electrode potential values required to achieve a certain net rate or current density of the water decomposition reaction depends strongly on the pH value. Oxygen-evolving electrodes, in particular, incur a significantly higher overpotential (<span class="italic">η</span><small><sub>OER</sub></small> = <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>OER</sub></small> − <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>eq,OER</sub></small>) under neutral or acidic conditions than under alkaline conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40,41</span></sup></a> The overpotential at hydrogen-evolving electrodes (<span class="italic">η</span><small><sub>HER</sub></small> = <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>HER</sub></small> − <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>eq,HER</sub></small>) is higher in neutral and alkaline environments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> The overall water decomposition reaction is the reverse process of the water production reaction in a hydrogen fuel cell, in which H<small><sub>2</sub></small> flows around the anode to be oxidised in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and O<small><sub>2</sub></small> flows around the cathode to be reduced in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The maximal terminal voltage <span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>t</sub></small> (under equilibrium condition at zero current) or equilibrium voltage of an oxyhydrogen fuel cell is identical to the minimal decomposition voltage of water electrolysis (<span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>t</sub></small> = <span class="italic">U</span><small><sub>0</sub></small> = 1.229 V under standard conditions). Depending upon the solution pH, different OER and HER water electrolysis half-cell reactions and different HOR and ORR fuel-cell half-cell reactions can be defined.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Under acidic conditions for the OER, two water molecules are converted into four protons (H<small><sup>+</sup></small>) and one oxygen molecule. In neutral and alkaline media, the OER involves the oxidation of four hydroxide ions to water. The direct oxidation of hydroxide anions on the electrode might be favoured over that of neutral water molecules, due to attractive interactions between anions and the positive anode – an effect that depends on the surface charging relation of the (supported) electrocatalyst material and the corresponding local reaction environment established.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44–46</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The HER takes place at the negatively-charged cathode. When hydrated extra protons (hydronium ions) are available in significant concentrations in acidic electrolytes, they are the preferred reactant and are reduced, eventually leading to the formation of a hydrogen molecule from two protons and two electrons. However, in neutral and alkaline media, the concentration of protons is negligible compared to that of water, and the reduction of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O molecules prevails. The HER requires two-electron transfer steps, whereas the OER comprises at least four steps, typically proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps, and three reaction intermediates. The more complex reaction pathway of the OER causes a higher overall activation energy, thus resulting in the more sluggish reaction kinetics. Rationalising the complex reaction behaviour of the OER requires detailed mechanistic models and analytical concepts that will be discussed below.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit47"><sup><span class="sup_ref">47,48</span></sup></a></p>

      <p class="otherpara">The flow of electric current influences the electrode potentials at anode and cathode for three reasons. Firstly, the kinetics of charge transfer at electrochemical interfaces is kinetically hindered and thus proceeds at a finite rate. A sufficient overvoltage must be applied to accelerate the charge transfer rate to the value required for achieving the target current density. Secondly, in order to supply electroactive species to the interface at the rate, at which they are being consumed, mass-transport limitations or resistances must be overcome. In water electrolysis, relevant transport processes involve charged ionic species, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, hydronium ions or hydroxide anions, and the voltage loss incurred by their transport requirements in liquid electrolyte, or polymer electrolyte membranes (AEM or PEM) and ionomer-impregnated electrodes, is described by Ohm's law that implies a linear relation between voltage loss and current density. Thirdly, the electronic conductors present on both sides of the interface cause further ohmic potential losses.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Depending on the value of the electrode potential relative to the equilibrium electrode potential, either the forward reaction or the reverse reaction of each electrode reaction is slowed down or accelerated. In this way, at the anode, the oxidation half-reaction will be accelerated by an electrode potential that exceeds the equilibrium potential of the OER, <span class="italic">η</span><small><sub>OER</sub></small> = <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>OER</sub></small> − <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>eq,OER</sub></small> &gt; 0, and at the cathode the reduction half-reaction will be accelerated by an electrode potential that is smaller than the equilibrium electrode potential of the HER, <span class="italic">η</span><small><sub>HER</sub></small> = <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>HER</sub></small> − <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>eq,HER</sub></small> &lt; 0.

      <p class="otherpara">At practically-relevant current densities of water electrolysis, the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen involve the nucleation, growth, detachment and transport of gas bubbles. These processes cause further increases in the voltage losses associated with the reaction kinetics and ion transport.

        <h3 id="sect1451"><span class="b_heading">2.4 What to expect from theory and computation in the field of water electrolysis</span></h3>
        <span>Theory and computation can support the development of highly-performing and durable electrocatalyst materials and electrode media for water electrolysis in the following three areas: (i) devise a set of theory-based activity and stability descriptors to steer efforts in materials discovery and inverse design,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit134"><sup><span class="sup_ref">134–137</span></sup></a> (ii) employ efficient computational tools based on artificial intelligence to rapidly search the complex parameter space<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit138"><sup><span class="sup_ref">138–144</span></sup></a> in conjunction with advances in autonomous or self-driving laboratories<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">144–146</span></sup></a> and (iii) implement smart approaches in electrode design and fabrication based on knowledge of reaction mechanisms, pathways and local reaction conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">147,148</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">The local reaction environment (LRE) that prevails at the catalyst's surface under real operating conditions plays a central role in this endeavour. On the one hand, it is crucial to understand how the LRE depends on the operating regime, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, cell current density or cell voltage, and the externally-controlled parameters such as pressure and temperature – this is the challenge that porous electrode theory and modelling must address. On the other hand, the impact of the LRE on electrocatalytic reaction mechanism and pathways as well as kinetic rate constants must be rationalised – this task calls for concerted efforts in interface theory, microkinetic modelling, and quantum-mechanical (DFT-based) calculations of energy and interactions parameters that control surface adsorption states as well as reactive transformations between them.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Once the optimal LRE has been determined by connecting these aspects, electrode design and fabrication will aim to provide these conditions uniformly over all available catalyst surface sites dispersed in a porous composite electrode. The departure from optimally-uniform conditions can be quantified by calculating the effectiveness factor of catalyst utilisation, as demonstrated for cathode catalyst layers (CCLs) in PEM fuel cells.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">149–153</span></sup></a> For CCLs in PEM fuel cells, well-established hierarchical models describe the interplay of transport and reaction at different structural levels, <span class="italic">viz.</span> (i) single pore, (ii) mesoscopic agglomerate of Pt nanoparticles, carbon-based support and dispersed ionomer aggregates, and (iii) macroscopic porous composite layer.

        <p class="otherpara">An overall effectiveness factor of Pt utilisation in PEM fuel cells that accounts for statistical utilisation effects was determined to be even smaller, lying in the range of 1 to 4%.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">153</span></sup></a> For PEMWE, a similar model-based calculation and assessment of effectiveness factors in Ir-based anodes have not been made, as electrode models that account for a hierarchy of transport and electrokinetic effects in porous electrodes have not been developed to a sufficient level of sophistication. However, it can be expected that the overall effectiveness factor of Ir-utilisation will be about as small, most likely even smaller, due to the less extensive efforts in CL design for PEMWE and to the fact that (at least present) IrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> OER catalysts are unsupported and of larger particle size than present PtM/C-based ORR catalysts in PEMFCs.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The OER activity in the PEMWE anode is highly dependent on electronic interactions between the electrode material and reaction intermediates. Binding energies of reaction intermediates can thus be employed as viable descriptors for the comparative assessment or “screening” of electrocatalyst materials in terms of their activity for the OER.

        <p class="otherpara">In the past few years, a concerted theoretical-computational framework for modelling interface properties and electrocatalytic reactions has been developed.

        <p class="otherpara">The mean-field double layer model yields the local reaction environment (LRE) required for the microkinetic model.

Closing the self-consistency loop, (iv) the LRE obtained as the output of the double-layer model is used as input for the microkinetic model, which in turn defines the boundary condition for the double-layer model. The resulting surface charge density calculated from the double layer model impacts the binding energies of reaction intermediates, defining another coupling effect that the approach solves self-consistently. Solving the coupled model at a series of electrode potentials, one can build a closed system of relations between the microscopic parameter space of catalyst composition and interfacial properties and the macroscopic parameter space of the effective electrocatalytic activity for the reaction of interest.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The capabilities of the concerted approach that self-consistently integrates DFT-based first-principles calculations for parameterisation of microscopic mechanistic parameters, a mean-field type model of the double layer, and a microkinetic model for the multistep kinetics were demonstrated in ref. <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48">48</a> for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at Pt(111).

Both the RDS and PDS concepts, which have been employed in the past to guide comparative materials assessment and screening, start from a premise that a single elementary step could be identified that determines the net rate of the overall reaction. This premise is, however, usually overly reductionist, and it fails to capture vital details of multistep reactions. Using RDS and PDS concepts could, therefore, mislead searches for the most active electrocatalyst material for a particular reaction, as demonstrated in the volcano plots in Fig. 4 and 6 of ref. <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit47">47</a>.</p>

This means that a single descriptor based on the chemisorption energy of a reaction intermediate or the d-band center of the metal, as employed in computational approaches based on the CHE, is not sufficient for catalyst screening. Clearly, the LRE that is related to the charging or capacitive response of the interface must be accounted for.

In these facilities, the hydrogen produced has a renewable origin (hydroelectric power) and is, therefore, a ‘green’ endeavour for (alkaline) water electrolysis. Hydrogen production uses electricity produced in off-peak (low-demand) times, or at times of large river flows in the spring, enabling electricity storage in the form of chemical bonds (power-to-hydrogen). When the peak electricity generation is needed, hydrogen can be converted back to electricity <span class="italic">via</span> fuel cells,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> although hydrogen is typically used locally as a chemical, notably in plants producing fertilisers (Aswan, Nangaï, Trail), but also in metallurgy and for the production of heavy water. At present, another technology of alkaline electrolysis produces a wealth of pure hydrogen: the brine electrolysis process. In this case, the reaction at the positive electrode is not the evolution of oxygen, but the evolution of chlorine, the hydrogen rarely been utilised as a fuel for fuel cells, but instead as a chemical (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, to produce hydrogen peroxide)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit230"><sup><span class="sup_ref">230</span></sup></a> or for heat generation.

          <p class="otherpara">Importantly, there is no net consumption of the electrolyte and only water is consumed. Provided that water is supplied at the rate at which it is consumed, the concentration of the ions remains constant. During the electrolysis, mobile proton species remain confined with the highly-acidic polymer membrane. Due to this, noble metal catalysts that are resistant to such acidity are required at both the cathode and the anode.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Modern PEMWEs contain perfluorinated sulphonic acid copolymer membranes because of their relatively high ionic conductivity (as compared to other membrane materials), high mechanical strength, and fairly strong chemical stability. The most widely used membrane material is Nafion® by DuPont de Nemours Co. (USA). Nafion® membranes are thin, elastic and transparent. However, swelling and dissociation of the ion-exchange groups of the membrane can occur when in contact with water, resulting in the free movement of protons from one electrode to another. The resistivity of perfluorinated sulphonic acid membranes is significantly larger than that of alkali solutions (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, 11–12 Ω cm at 20 °C and 5–6 Ω cm at 80–90 °C). Thin membranes having a thickness in the 100–300 μm range are used to reduce ohmic losses. However, using thin membranes increase the permeability of gases through the membrane, reducing the efficiency of the system. Since liquid electrolytes are not used in PEMWEs, the electrodes are pressed tightly against the membrane in a zero-gap configuration. The catalysts used in PEMWEs are deposited on the surface of the ion-conducting membrane (to form a CCM – catalyst coated membrane) to achieve high surface contact between the catalyst and the electrolyte. Porous current collectors are then pressed against these CCMs, adjacent electrolysis cells being stacked together and separated by metallic bipolar plates. The intimate contact between the porous transport layer (PTL) is critical to reach high performance PEMWE. The HER electrode morphology can essentially be kept similar to that of PEMFC anodes (where H<small><sub>2</sub></small> oxidation occurs). Pt-based catalysts supported on high surface area carbon in contact with a conventional gas diffusion layer (GDL) encompassing a microporous layer (mixture of high surface area carbon and PTFE binder) is appropriate,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241,242</span></sup></a> and further refinements are possible (fluorinated carbons improve the performance<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit243"><sup><span class="sup_ref">243</span></sup></a>). On the OER side, the issue is more complex, because carbon is not stable; hence, titanium-based PTL are usually employed as the porous current collector. Because they are complex to nanostructure, Ti-based PTL usually display coarser structures than carbon-based ones, enabling poorer distribution of the electrical contact points to the OER catalyst layer. As a result, the OER preferentially occurs at the regions of the catalyst layer near to good conducting paths (contact points) of the PTL, resulting in very heterogeneous OER within the catalyst layer<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119,244</span></sup></a> especially with alteration of the PTL/catalyst layer conductivity, owing to unavoidable increase of the interfacial contact resistance of the Ti PTL upon gradual passivation in OER regime.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> PTL with finer structures improve the situation, resulting in more numerous electrical contact points between the PTL and the catalyst layer<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit246"><sup><span class="sup_ref">246</span></sup></a> opening the way to more tailored designed GDSs for the OER in PEMWE.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit247"><sup><span class="sup_ref">247,248</span></sup></a> The catalysts used in PEMWEs are generally platinum group metals (PGMs).

However, it must be noted that Ru-based electrodes can have poor stability in acidic conditions. The most commonly used anode catalyst is iridium (Ir) with loadings of around 1.0–2.0 mg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, whereas platinum (Pt) or palladium (Pd) are the main catalysts used at the cathode, with the anode current collectors being constructed of a porous titanium (Ti) material and the cathode current collectors being constructed of carbon material.</p>

          <span>In a proton-conducting ceramic electrolyser (PCCEL) water vapour is supplied to the oxygen electrode side (anode), and pure H<small><sub>2</sub></small> is generated at the cathode (no dilution by water vapour). The cathode in both a SOEC and a PCCEL is typically a Ni-in-oxide-electrolyte composite (cermet). Since the water vapour is supplied to the anode, it is expected to avoid Ni oxidation and irreversible agglomeration at the cathode. In addition, the intermediate operating temperatures of a PCCEL (around 500 °C) brings economic advantages: (i) the required electrical energy for water electrolysis decreases as the operating temperature increases, since a significant portion of the energy supplied is in the form of thermal energy; (ii) the sluggish kinetic issues at low temperatures are offset by the elevated operating temperatures. Therefore, PCCELs enable water electrolysis with higher efficiency than low-temperature electrolysers. Although the first demonstration of PCCEL technology was reported in 1981, its development has been slow due to the technical difficulty associated with the fabrication of the bilayer structure in the configuration of thin and dense electrolyte/porous electrode support. They also suffer from the same poor thermos-mechanical properties as SOEC.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">On 8th July 2020, the European Union (EU) launched “A hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe”<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a> as part of its Green Deal but also announced two other important initiatives – the Energy System Integration plan and the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance (E2CH2A). The overall objective is to establish a European hydrogen economy and to make of euro the currency of choice on the global market. The industry led E2CH2A intends to promote investments in hydrogen production and application.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">All three initiatives offer a unique opportunity for using wind- and PV-sourced renewable hydrogen (RH<small><sub>2</sub></small>) to supply fuel and chemical feedstock throughout Europe and to store energy in salt caverns. Clean hydrogen production capacity is projected to grow to 1 million tonnes by 2024 and 10 million by 2030 – meaning 6 and 40 GW by 2024 and 2030, respectively. Adding in 40 GW produced in neighbouring countries, 2030 capacity will reduce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions by 100 million tonnes.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The total cost of kick-starting a European hydrogen economy is estimated at €430 billion, with initial EU investments coming to €96 billion. The funding will be split between electrolysers (13%), offshore (47%) and onshore wind (25%) and solar PV (15%). The aim is to produce 4.4 million tonnes of RH<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the EU. An additional €91.5 billion will be spent producing 4 million tonnes in Ukraine and North Africa.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The European electrolyser industry will create an estimated 170<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 jobs.

      <p class="otherpara">Overall, an EU-wide market for hydrogen promises significant value-adds within a multi-billion-euro high-tech environment.

The technology's competitiveness will hinge on the swift delivery of new, innovative and sustainable solutions promising efficient, on-demand power. These solutions will be vital to meet societal demand for reliable, clean and efficient energy generation through smart, green and integrated networks. By 2050, a continent-wide hydrogen market could generate €820 billion in revenues, provide 5.4 million jobs, and avoid 560 million tonnes of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> a year.

      <span>It is clear that green hydrogen production (coupling renewable energy systems with electrolysers) is witnessing an exponential increase. According to the Hydrogen Council, hydrogen could help meet almost a quarter of the global energy demand by 2050, creating a US$10 trillion addressable market. These projections are supported by the recent strong hydrogen-focused national hydrogen strategies, for example in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, the EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Chile and the USA. Moreover, Aurora Energy Research predicts that a 1000-fold increase in electrolyser units is expected by 2040.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260,261</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">Overall, most green hydrogen projects involve the installation of PEMWEs and AWEs as they are well-established technologies, although AEMWE (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Enapter) and SOEC (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Haldor Topsoe) technologies are currently being chosen as potential candidates for large-scale hydrogen production. Water electrolysis is the most significant primary electrochemical method for hydrogen production, and its importance will increase rapidly with renewable energy production.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">However, water electrolysis technologies strongly depend upon the materials used <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, catalysts, electrolytes, separators, working temperatures and pressures. Currently, hydrogen production <span class="italic">via</span> electrolysis is more expensive than <span class="italic">via</span> other methods due to the capital costs and dependence on electricity costs. Although the CAPEX and OPEX of electrolysers have been reduced noticeably since 2012, further improvements are required, especially when operated solely on renewable energy sources; limited utilisation increases the impact of the CAPEX and OPEX on commercial viability. A second objective is to improve the electrolyser system's efficiency to reduce cost and the electricity consumed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As a “rule of thumb” for all electrolysers, new materials which are low-cost, highly performing, and durable with a particular focus on thinner membranes (electrolytes), more active and durable catalysts and less critical raw materials, are required.</p>

          <span>A peculiar characteristic of AEMWE, the high operating pressure, creates a unique operational challenge that requires special attention for the design of AEMs. Mechanical properties of the membrane and other components are almost the same for both PEM and AEM electrolysers, hence-no design modifications of cell components are required when hydrogen pressure at the cathode is limited to less than 10 bars.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit374"><sup><span class="sup_ref">374</span></sup></a> However, when hydrogen is pressurised in the cathode compartment, the increase in hydrogen cross-permeation through the membrane needs to be carefully considered. The hydrogen permeability of an AEM (hydrocarbon-based) is usually around one order of magnitude less than that of its counterpart PEM; so, the hydrogen barrier ability of an AEM of ∼28 μm thickness corresponds to that of a ∼175 μm-thick PEM,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit375"><sup><span class="sup_ref">375</span></sup></a> and substantially thinner membrane can be used in AEMWEs than in PEMWEs, one of the many advantages of AEMs for electrolysis.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Mechanical failure of the membrane can contribute to the failure of the entire device; thus, membrane durability is critical to overall system design. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14</a> gives an overview of the mechanical properties of selected AEMs. In general, for AEMs to be used in AEMWEs, high Young's modulus, a high tensile strength, and high elongation at break are desired. These properties are usually reported for AEM in their dry halide form at room temperature, which is, unfortunately, not relevant for AEMWE. Higher tensile strength of the catalyst ionomer improves the electrode-membrane adhesion and reduces electrode crack formation, which positively influences the device performance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit376"><sup><span class="sup_ref">376</span></sup></a> For AEMs, benchmark values of &gt;10 MPa stress at break, &gt;100% elongation at break, and a Young's modulus between 75–400 MPa are proposed as being essential to obtain robust membranes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit377"><sup><span class="sup_ref">377</span></sup></a></p>

          <p class="otherpara">Overcoming degradation caused by the alkaline electrolyte is still challenging. The molecular structure of the anion-conducting polymers (both for AEMs and ionomers in the electrodes) breaks down due to the strong reactivity of the hydroxide ions with the quaternary ammonium (QA) cation leading to a detrimental reduction of the membrane IEC, which, in turn, reduces the anion conductivity (increases cell resistance), causing a rapid decay in the AEMWE performance.

        <span>SOEC commonly requires high operating temperatures (≥700 °C), because the yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte only displays excellent ionic conductivity at these temperatures. However, during long-term operations, YSZ suffers from thermomechanical and thermochemical issues, particularly under shutdown and temperature ramping conditions, which lead to increased degradation rates and shorter stack and system lifetimes. There are also other issues related to SOEC stack degradation <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, sealing failure at higher differential pressure, electrode contamination originating from external components (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, piping), interconnects and sealing. SOECs are today only deployed at the &lt;1 MW scale, although some current demonstration projects have already reached 1 MW. Deploying SOEC at large scale would require larger SOEC cells than currently used <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, up from 300 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> to over 1000 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>, which makes them more susceptible to failure.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">SOEC is mainly made of abundant and low-cost minerals (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Y, Zr, Sr, La, Mn, Ni) and ceramic materials (no rare metals/critical raw minerals are employed).

        <p class="otherpara">Therefore, the R&amp;D focuses on improving the electrolyte conductivity matching the thermal expansion coefficient of both electrodes, ensuring minimal reactant crossover and optimising chemical and mechanical stability.

      <span>Due to the importance of water electrolysis and related electrocatalysis, many in-depth and excellent reviews on PGM-based HER and OER electrocatalysts have been recently published.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit133"><sup><span class="sup_ref">133,403–405</span></sup></a> This section will attempt to capture general findings in recent advances in developing strategies to improve HER and OER noble metal-based electrocatalysts.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Generally, one of the most critical barriers for electrochemical water splitting is to use high-performance and durable electrocatalytic material that allow both fast HER and OER reaction kinetics and low overpotentials. The choice of HER and OER catalysts in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes is important as the HER and OER reaction kinetics and overpotential will differ. For example, the HER activity in acidic electrolytes is usually 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than in alkaline ones, because the water dissociation step is unnecessary in an acidic environment and the high concentration of H<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions results in faster H–H coupling than at high pH.</p>

        <span>HER activity is related to hydrogen adsorption (H<small><sub>ad</sub></small>) in acidic media, which is composed of either Volmer/Heyrovsky (<a title="" href="#eqn6">eqn (6)</a>) or Volmer/Tafel (<a title="" href="#eqn5">eqn (5)</a>) steps. In alkaline electrolytes, the Heyrovsky (<a title="" href="#eqn4">eqn (4)</a>) and Volmer (<a title="" href="#eqn7">eqn (7)</a>) steps occur involving hydroxyl adsorption (OH<small><sub>ad</sub></small>), and water dissociation, breaking the strong covalent H–O–H bond. In acidic electrolytes, H<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> adsorption is much stronger than water adsorption for alkaline conditions. The HER kinetics are highly dependent on various parameters such as the electrode material, the nature of the electrolyte and the crystalline nature and orientation of the electrode (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, single-crystal, polycrystalline or amorphous).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit406"><sup><span class="sup_ref">406</span></sup></a> Hydrogen adsorption and desorption on the electrode surface are two successive steps in HER electrocatalysis. However, these two steps compete in nature: a catalyst surface with insufficient bonding strength to hydrogen atoms cannot efficiently adsorb the reactant to initiate the HER; whereas a catalyst surface having too high bonding strength would have difficulty in releasing the product toward the completion of the HER. Therefore, the ideal HER electrocatalysts should have well-balanced hydrogen adsorption and desorption properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit407"><sup><span class="sup_ref">407</span></sup></a> This is entirely in line with the Sabatier principle, which states that to have high catalytic activity, the interaction between reactants and catalysts should neither be too strong nor too weak.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit408"><sup><span class="sup_ref">408</span></sup></a> If the interaction is too weak, the catalyst surface will hardly bind the M–H intermediate species, resulting in slow reaction kinetics.

The best electrocatalytic activity of Pt electrodes for the HER arises in acid solutions where the nominal extent of measured OPD H coverage is found to correspond to the apparent formation of 8 equivalent monolayers; one possible interpretation of that result is in terms of hydride formation in the near-surface region of Pt. As a result, the OPD M–H adsorption bond can be weakened so that the recombination step with low Tafel slope becomes the favoured desorption step and characterises the kinetics at active Pt electrodes. Based on Conway <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit414"><sup><span class="sup_ref">414</span></sup></a> Tafel slopes of 36–68 mV dec<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at low overpotentials (<span class="italic">η</span> ≤ 0.05) followed by 125 mV dec<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at high overpotentials ∼<span class="italic">η</span> &gt; 0.075 V in a 0.5 M H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> electrolyte for bulk Pt disc electrode have been reported.

          <span>Various strategies have been adopted to reduce the loading of platinum and other PGMs such as Pd, Ru, Ir and Rh as they are expensive and scarce. Examples include alloying them or producing core–shell structures with low cost and abundant metals such as transition metals (TM <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Ni, Ti, Zr <span class="italic">etc.</span>) without compromising on the performance and catalyst utilisation. To boost the HER activity, especially in alkaline solutions, alloying PGMs like Pt with TMs can greatly improve catalyst utilisation by modifying the alloy electronic structure, in turn favouring efficient HER. For example, it was found that the downshift d-band centre of Pt weakens the adsorption energy of hydroxyl species (OH*) on the surface Pt atom.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit415"><sup><span class="sup_ref">415</span></sup></a> For alkaline electrolytes, several researchers have worked on improving the M–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O by developing new structures such as PGM nanoparticles on nitrogenated carbon (PGM@C2N).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit416"><sup><span class="sup_ref">416</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">To improve the slow HER kinetics, dual-active electrocatalytic sites <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, bifunctional HER catalysts need to be engineered allowing better water adsorption/dissociation, hydrogen adsorption/desorption, and OH<small><sup>−</sup></small> desorption.

        <span>The OER is the key process that controls the overall efficiency of electrochemical water splitting. This is because the OER is more kinetically sluggish as this reaction is a four-electron transfer process, while the HER needs only two electrons. Binding energy (M–O, M–OH, and M–OOH) is mainly the rudimentary benchmark for OER performance that is usually tuned by electronic and geometric structural “engineering”. Overall, PGM play crucial roles because of their high activities and good selectivity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit419"><sup><span class="sup_ref">419</span></sup></a> Under acidic environments, the PGM catalytic activities decrease in the order of Ru &gt; Ir &gt; Rh &gt; Pd &gt; Pt &gt; Au, while the structural durability follows the order of Pd &gt; Pt &gt; Rh &gt; Ir &gt; Au &gt; Ru. The most efficient OER catalysts are so far combined Ir and Ru electrocatalysts as it possesses excellent dissolution resistance in acidic conditions. Their oxides such as RuO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and IrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, are considered as state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the OER.

In particular, the doping element was found fairly unstable in operation.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">For OER applications, incursions to reducing potentials are avoided, which leaves hope to obtain more stable (doped) metal oxide structures. For example, Claudel <span class="italic">et al.</span> evaluated several doped SnO<small><sub>2</sub></small> aerogels (IrOx/doped SnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>), and assessed their electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability towards the OER.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34,445</span></sup></a> Using a flow cell connected to an inductively-coupled mass spectrometer (FC-ICP-MS), they revealed that the corrosion-resistance of the doping element controls the long-term OER activity of the material. In addition, the doping element concentration in the host SnO<small><sub>2</sub></small> matrix controls the electron conductivity of the material, hence its propensity to be practically active. The study further demonstrated that Sb-doped SnO<small><sub>2</sub></small> type supports continuously dissolve in OER operation. On the contrary, Ta-doped or Nb-doped SnO<small><sub>2</sub></small> supports are more stable under acidic OER conditions, provided their doping concentration is appropriate. Although these studies open a door to nanostructured IrO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> OER catalysts (hence to large depreciation of the materials’ cost of a PEMWE MEA), there is still large room for practical improvements. Developing active and durable nanostructured IrOx catalysts for OER in acidic media is therefore still a mandatory research topic if one wants to deploy PEMWE at large scale.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The previous paragraphs showed that PGM-based catalysts are still the norm in PEMWE (and the (almost) only ones that are active and durable in practical acidic operation). In the search for alternative catalyst materials, the present review will focus specifically on catalysts for alkaline systems, for which the available chemistries are far richer (see following sections). Of course, some of these chemistries can find applications in PEMWE cells, as will be specified as well.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">There are already many brilliant reviews that deal exclusively or partially with perovskite oxide-based materials as water-splitting catalysts. Some of these published articles deal with perovskite oxides for photocatalysis purposes<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit560"><sup><span class="sup_ref">560–571</span></sup></a> but some of them provide an overview of the knowledge of water electrolysis on perovskite-based materials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24,86,451,572–589</span></sup></a> Numerous advanced theoretical and experimental studies have been published, leading to a variety of perovskite-type oxides as potential ORR,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit590"><sup><span class="sup_ref">590</span></sup></a> OER<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit591"><sup><span class="sup_ref">591–597,611</span></sup></a> and HER<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit598"><sup><span class="sup_ref">598–600,619</span></sup></a> electrocatalysts. Because of the severe oxidative conditions experienced at OER anodes, and the highly-reductive conditions at the HER cathode, metal oxides have traditionally been found more adapted for the OER. This is also reflected in the position of the metal oxides within the Pourbaix diagram (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29</a>): the number of contributions to perovskite-based OER catalysts far exceeds the number that can be ascribed to HER electrocatalysis. Due to the drastically-increased research output of transition metal-based materials for energy applications, we are unable to give a detailed overview of all known structure-activity relationships or all existing articles that mention perovskite-mediated OER or HER electrocatalysis. We shall therefore limit ourselves to investigations which cover the mile stones and the last stage reached.</p>

          <span>Single-metal based (oxy)hydroxides, while not being among the most active OER catalysts within this material family, provide the basis on which more complex and active multinary (oxy)hydroxides can be designed. Therefore, their study is important to provide fundamental insights and guide the rational design of improved catalysts. Among them, Ni hydroxides can be prepared in the crystalline brucite-like β-phase, β-Ni(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which is characterised by layers of edge-sharing octahedra, where the metal atoms occupy the center of the octahedra and OH groups the corners. Co hydroxides can also be synthesised in this structure (β-Co(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small>). In addition, other phases have been reported, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, water intercalated Ni(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small> (α-phase) and others characterised by various types of defects and turbostratic disorder. Ni oxyhydroxide phases, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, anhydrous β-NiOOH and water and cation intercalated γ-NiOOH, form under applied anodic potentials. Co hydroxides also transform to the oxyhydroxide phase (β-CoOOH) under applied anodic potentials.

The reader will find a solid number of review articles dealing in whole<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit915"><sup><span class="sup_ref">915–919</span></sup></a> or in part<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit920"><sup><span class="sup_ref">920–927</span></sup></a> with the subject of Section 7.5, and is directed to these articles and additional information on these subjects. The compounds discussed in this subsection are divided into five classes (i) metal borides (Section 7.5.1), (ii) metal carbides (Section 7.5.2), (iii) metal pnictides (Section 7.5.3), (iv) metal chalcogenides (7.5.4) and (v) metal-nonmetal compounds bearing different nonmetal elements (Section 7.5.5). Section 7.5 is in principle restricted to compounds that are noble elements-free, except for Rh<small><sub>2</sub></small>C and RuB<small><sub>2</sub></small> which fit better here than in Section 6.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The HER intermediate being the H-adsorbed active site after electrochemical discharge of a proton, an efficient HER electrocatalyst is characterised by neither too high nor too low M–H<small><sub>ads</sub></small> bond strengths.

When comparing binary metal oxides with binary metal-sulphur or metal-phosphorus compounds, one expects oxides to be more sensitive to reductive potentials than metal-sulphur or metal-phosphorus compounds, since the negative charge density (localised at the central metal ion in the metal-S or metal-P species) is higher than for the metal oxides (oxygen is more electronegative than S or P). As mentioned in Sections 7.2 and 7.3, metal oxides are (due to reductive conditions that occur on the HER side) less durable upon HER operation. This qualitative reasoning explains why metal chalcogenides with the heavier elements from main group 6 are better-suited than metal oxides for HER electrocatalysis. This agrees very well with the observation that phosphide-, sulfide- and selenide- based surfaces in many cases are transformed into their corresponding oxides during catalysis, with only their core intact with the pre-catalyst (at least under oxidative conditions).</p>

            <p class="otherpara">The field of metal phosphide HER catalysts has expanded since then rapidly. A variety of binary, ternary and higher order metal phosphides with <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, high-symmetry ionic crystal structures like NaCl type or more complex structures have been synthesised and checked for their electrocatalytic properties. The electrical conductivity differs depending on the composition and M-P bond (ionic, metallic or covalent) and ranges from semiconducting to metallic to superconducting.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Depending on the composition, the chemical properties also vary, which, for example, leads to an inertia in relation to the dissolution in acids/bases or which makes them easily soluble (Cd- or Zn phosphide) thereby affecting its suitability to act as an HER electrocatalyst. Basically Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, W and Mo phosphides were found promising cathode materials for water electrolysis. Based on DFT approaches, the P atom plays a major role for the catalytic activity of metal phosphide in metal phosphides. The ability of metal phosphides to act as proton-reducing species (to initiate HER) stands and falls with the trend of the negatively-charged P atom to donate electrons. Thus, for the same metal phosphide, increasing the percentage of P in the total number of atoms is known to enhance the HER activity (Ni<small><sub>5</sub></small>P<small><sub>4</sub></small> &gt; Ni<small><sub>2</sub></small>P)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1063"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1063</span></sup></a> and an increased P content leads to better corrosion resistance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1064"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1064</span></sup></a> On the other hand, if P is continuously doped in metals, the conductivity decreases.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit926"><sup><span class="sup_ref">926</span></sup></a></p>

      <span>In water electrolysis, as in any electrochemical processes, electrocatalysts are used to increase the charge-transfer kinetics and to maximise the energy efficiency of the redox processes taking place at the interfaces. The electrochemical performance of the catalytic layers essentially depends on three factors: the catalysts’ intrinsic electrochemical activity, deployed electrochemical surface area (ESCA) and accessibility to reactants and products, the latter depending more on active layer engineering than on electrocatalyst engineering. Research into materials with optimised electrocatalytic properties therefore requires, on the one hand, to measure the intrinsic electrochemical activity of each half-cell reactions of interest and, on the other hand, nano-structuring so to maximise the surface area of the electrocatalytic particles|electrolytes interface (and the material texture to make it compatible with fast mass-transport in the active layer). Nano-structuring can be obtained using different manufacturing processes. This section describes methods and techniques to manufacture electrocatalysts and electrodes used in water electrolysis applications: electrodeposition, chemical precipitation, self-assembly, atomic layer deposition, physical vapour deposition, spray pyrolysis, ultrasonic spraying <span class="italic">etc.</span>, all enable to tailor the materials electrocatalytic and mass-transfer properties.</span>

            <span>The price of iridium and the significant fluctuations in its price on the raw materials market challenges the development of the PEMWE. Efforts have been made among the scientific community to find OER alternatives to IrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, but the task is very challenging and, to date, no real solutions to this problem have been proposed. Most research efforts focus on the reduction or Ir loadings (a factor of ten is targeted compared to 2.0 mg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> loadings commonly used; ∼ 1.0 mg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> is already common good practice at the industrial scale). Different approaches have been investigated and reported in the literature. Conventional OER electrocatalysts are made of micrometre sized IrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> particles. Since 90% of the atoms of a 1 nanometre-sized cuboctahedral Ir particle are exposed at the surface, the cost issue could be alleviated by decreasing the size of the anodic electrocatalyst, assuming that the increased adsorption strength of oxygenated species on the smallest nanocrystallites does not significantly lower their intrinsic OER activity and stability. Decreasing the IrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> crystallite size to <span class="italic">ca.</span> 5–15 nm is required to improve both OER mass activity and stability, while leading to a drastic reduction of the Ir content at the anode of a PEM water electrolyser.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">The synthesis and use of self-standing nanometric IrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> particles cause several problems. Their implementation at the anode of PEM water electrolysis cell can be achieved by using appropriate electron-conducting supports having (i) a large specific surface area to maximise the distribution of the nanoparticles (NPs) while preventing their agglomeration/aggregation, (ii) an optimal pore size distribution to allow easy access of reactants to the electrode and products removal from the electrode. The catalyst support should also withstand high electrochemical potentials (+1.8 to +2.1 V <span class="italic">vs.</span> SHE), highly acidic environment and moderate operating temperature (&lt;80–90 °C). Carbon blacks, the usual catalyst support in PEMFCs,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1424"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1424</span></sup></a> and any types of carbonaceous structures are strongly unstable in PEMWE anodes (carbon is oxidised at potentials above +0.207 V <span class="italic">vs.</span> SHE) and cannot be used for that purpose.

            <span>The Pt content used at PEMWE cathodes is low (&lt;0.1–0.2 mg<small><sub>Pt</sub></small> cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) but nevertheless contributes to the higher cost of PEMWEs compared to A(EM)WEs. In addition, platinum is extremely sensitive to the presence of impurities (organic or inorganic), which imposes severe constraints on the management of the water purity used in PEMWEs. So, the search for alternatives to platinum remains a subject of interest for the scientific community and the industry. The idea is to replace platinum with transition metals (Ni, Co, Fe), the same as those used in alkaline water electrolysis. In alkaline media, passivation of these metals prevents their dissolution. Hence, they cannot be used directly in acid media, where these metal oxides are not sufficient durable. Molecular chemistry offers some interesting solutions to such problem. Cobalt, nickel, and iron ions can be introduced in inorganic cage-like organic structures such as the clathrochelates shown on <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig107">Fig. 107a</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1443"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1443</span></sup></a> In homogeneous solution, these complexes are chemically stable, and the redox properties of the central metallic center can be tuned by selecting appropriate peripherical radicals of various electro-attractive effects.

            <p class="otherpara">Such complexes and other molecular-type catalysts have been widely studied on the fundamental side (see Sections 10 and 11). They can be implemented at the cathode of PEM water electrolysis cells after adsorption at the surface of appropriate substrates such as carbonaceous compounds, commonly used to support Pt nanoparticles. The main difficulty remains despite everything the functionalisation of these catalysts on these substrates to form practical electrodes. At the laboratory scale, in order to evaluate the electroactivity of these molecular materials, simple functionalisation techniques (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> physisorption by impregnation,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1444"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1444,1445</span></sup></a> or by ultrasonics<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1446"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1446</span></sup></a>) can be used. They generally yield thin layers, which give satisfactory results but do not guarantee lifespans compatible with the targeted applications. More sophisticated functionalisation techniques are needed to produce highly active and stable monolayers. Electro-grafting is an interesting technique to use for that purpose. A two-step procedure consisting of (i) the electro-grafting of a monolayer of a diazonium derivative onto a carbonaceous substrate of interest and (ii) the chemical grafting of the compounds of interest onto the surface by simple chemical reaction, is commonly used. The technique has been used for electro-grafting of a cobalt clathrochelate containing carboxylic end-groups:<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1447"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1447</span></sup></a> a monolayer-thick deposit is obtained, corresponding to very low metal loadings (in the pg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> range).</p>

          <span>Generally, the catalyst ink (Pt/C or other catalyst-supported catalyst + IPA + water + ionomer) may be either deposited to the gas diffusion layer (GDL) to yield a gas diffusion electrode (GDE), also known as catalyst-coated substrate (CCS) or the polymeric proton exchange membrane (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, PFSA, <span class="italic">n</span>-PBI <span class="italic">etc.</span>) to form a catalyst-coated membrane (CCM). CCSs are usually prepared by screen-printing, hand-painting, ink-jetting, spreading, spraying (air and ultrasonic), (electro)deposition, ionomer impregnation, and sputtering. CCMs are produced by decaling, screen-printing, hand-painting, spraying (air and ultrasonic), impregnation/reduction, evaporation/deposition, sputtering, and dry spraying.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The electrodes used in PEMWEs have the particularity of being very thin (a few microns) and porous (they must allow the gases produced to pass and allow water to access the catalytic sites). In the literature, they are rather designated by the terms “catalytic layers” or sometimes “thin-film electrodes”. This is a porous mixture essentially containing the catalyst particles and the ionomer ensuring their ionic contact with the membrane. The composition and microstructure of these CLs are critical since they dictate the overall cell efficiency, and, to a large extent, its durability. The catalytic ink can be deposited either on both sides of the membrane to form a self-standing CCM, or onto an external substrate (CCS) which is then pressed against the membrane. The term membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is also commonly used.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A large number of processes have been reported in the literature to form or coat catalyst particles directly onto (PFSA) membranes, mainly to perform laboratory tests. Electroless plating has been very popular for a long period of time. For example, hexachloroplatinic acid can be chemically reduced onto the membrane by cross-permeation of a chemical reducer such as sodium borohydride.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1450"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1450</span></sup></a> Alternatively, the membrane can be first soaked into a solution of the chemical reducer for impregnation and then into a solution of the platinum precursor salt or be soaked in an aqueous solution containing a cationic species of platinum precursor before chemical reduction.

          <p class="otherpara">In early PEMFC applications, the platinum nanoparticles (used at the hydrogen anode and the oxygen cathode) were deposited on carbon GDLs to form GDEs, which are then pressed against the membrane. The need for large volume manufacturing and quality-monitoring has led to the narrowing down of available technologies for the development of automated coating processes, and particularly in the elaboration of CCMs;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1452"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1452</span></sup></a> this even more applies to PEMWE materials. In the latter case, catalyst particles (Pt/C for the cathode and IrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for the anode) are usually synthesised <span class="italic">ex situ</span> and then coated onto the membrane to form a CCM. There are basically two main options. The catalytic inks (a mixture of catalyst particles and ionomer in a solvent) are sprayed either directly onto the membrane, or onto a PTFE substrate and then transferred onto the membrane by hot pressing (so-called decal or electrode transfer method). This is performed using a catalytic ink printer, usually equipped with an ultrasonication nozzle to maintain the particle of catalyst in suspension, such as the one shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig108">Fig. 108</a>. Direct spray onto the membrane is simpler (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig109">Fig. 109</a>) but care must be taken to avoid solvent impregnation into the membrane and its detrimental swelling, favouring expansion/contraction upon the CCM elaboration process, hence possible destabilisation of the active layer (cracks, delamination). In that context, the decal method is interesting because solvent can be evaporated before transferring the electrodes to the membranes. Alternatively, magnetron-sputtering can also be used to form the particles onto a substrate.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1453"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1453</span></sup></a> Automated and continuous roll-to-roll manufacturing processes now commonly-used in PEMFC technologies are also becoming available for PEMWEs (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig110">Fig. 110</a>).</p>

The detailed knowledge of the composition, structure and mechanism of action of the oxygen evolving centre of photosystem II substantially helped to understand the sequential steps of water oxidation occurring through catalytically-active (inorganic) species on macroscopic electrodes and stimulated researchers in developing more efficient potential heterogeneous (solid state) water oxidation electrocatalysts.

        <p class="otherpara">This section deals with molecular OER and HER electrocatalysts (preferably working without sacrificial oxidant) that catalyse water splitting electrochemically, are in the dissolved state or are fixed to macroscopic electrodes (heterogenised) and do not represent a co-catalyst in photocatalyst materials. Water splitting mediated through metal organic framework (MOFs), nanoparticles (not being dissolved in the electrolyte) are at the boundary between molecular and solid-state catalysts and will not be discussed here. Water splitting supported by molecular electrocatalysts can, in principle, be assigned to both heterogeneous catalysis and homogeneous catalysis. When the catalytic active molecular species have been immobilised (heterogenised) by embedding them into a porous macroscopic electrode or by loading them onto a flat metal-oxide or semiconductor oxide-based macroscopic electrode (ITO, FTO), heterogeneous water electrocatalysis is carried out. When the molecular species capable to work as water oxidation electrocatalyst are in the dissolved state in the electrolyte and a macroscopic electrode is used for charge-transfer (namely the regeneration of the reduced form of the molecular species, which was reduced upon oxidising water molecules), homogeneous water electrolysis is performed because catalyst and substrate are in the same phase. The classification of this procedure does not change in case an additional sacrificial oxidant (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Ce(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) salts) are added. If regeneration of the molecular catalyst is ensured solely chemically by a sacrificial oxidant (see explanation below) homogeneously-catalysed water oxidation, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, chemical water oxidation, is carried out.

        <p class="otherpara">The coordinated metal centre does not present the catalytic active spot. The most active site is the nitrogen atom next to S vacancies as was shown by first principal calculations. Metal complexes in a way build a scientific bridge between the areas of homogeneous biological and heterogeneous solid-state catalysts. Challenges that scientist had to deal with include the low density of metal active sites compared to the overall size of the macromolecules and limited stability under electrolysis conditions. On the plus side we can mention the easiness regarding fine tuning and studying catalytic mechanism at a molecular level. Particularly when it comes to practical applicability, they fail in most of the relevant aspects. Classical heterogeneous catalysts lead to better apparent activity and durability, hence they are to date the only materials that can cope with practical water electrolysis.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect8909"><span class="a_heading">11 Characterisation methods</span></h2>
      <span>Water electrolysis reactions are electrochemical reactions, and as such, any electrochemical technique has its own interest to evaluate catalyst materials, electrodes (usually in 3-electrode cell) or full electrolysis cells (2-electrode cell). However, water electrolysis reactions also convey a double specificity. Firstly, the reactions at stake, the HER at the cathode – negative electrode in a water electrolysis cell, and OER at the anode – positive electrode in a water electrolysis cell, are multiple step reactions; hence, reaction intermediates are produced/consumed, which one will need to measure/quantify, to unveil the reaction mechanisms (see Section 2), a prerequisite to the discovery of more active (and durable) electrocatalysts. Hence, a variety of physicochemical methods coupled to electrochemistry are used by the research community to assist mechanism and kinetics understanding. The most relevant, in the authors’ opinion, will be addressed hereafter. Secondly, both the HER and OER do generate gases (molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen, respectively), which, if the rate of the reaction is sufficiently fast (a target for industrial systems), will not be purely dissolved (oversaturated) in the liquid electrolyte (water) but instead will generated bubbles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit822"><sup><span class="sup_ref">822</span></sup></a> These bubbles will likely induce considerable difficulties in the electrochemical (and physicochemical) experiments and must therefore be considered, so that the techniques at stake are not biases by them. The present section aims at covering these aspects. Methods that are relevant to evaluate the performance of full electrolysis cells (2-electrode cells) will be addressed in Section 11.1; methods to evaluate individual electrodes (in 3-electrode cells) will be covered in Section 11.2 and finally, more advanced techniques to characterise the constitutive materials of the electrolyser (with special emphasis of the electrocatalysts, but also minorly on the membranes) will be addressed in Section 11.3. This Section 11 will introduce short-term performance characterisations and accelerated degradation tests (ADT) or accelerated stress tests (AST), whereas Section 12 will revisit most of the techniques for long-term durability assessment.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect8914"><span class="b_heading">11.1 Two-electrode cell characterisations of the full electrolysis cell</span></h3>
        <span>The most common and easiest mean to characterise a water electrolysis cell (in a non-destructive manner) is to perform measurements in the actual cell without intruding any external probe (without inserting any device in the cell for the measurement, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, no reference electrode for 3-electrode cell measurements). In that case, acquiring polarisation plots, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the [current–cell voltage] characteristics in quasi-stationary conditions, is a widely-used methodology<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1709"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1709,1710</span></sup></a> that is readily practicable for industrial cells (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig141">Fig. 141a</a>, full symbols). The quasi-stationary conditions correspond to very slow solicitation of the system and enable to avoid any disturbance of the measured currents from capacitive effects that could be overwhelming for large-surface area electrodes (which is often the case in practical systems). The best manner to record a polarisation plot is to impose the current to the cell and measure its stable voltage (which may take a while), or to impose the cell voltage and measure the current drawn by the cell after its stabilisation. This is likely done by successive chronopotentiometric (resp. chronoamperometric) steps, whose duration should be long enough to enable the measured signal stabilisation prior any new jump to another quasi-stationary operating point. Then, longer-term chronopotentiometry (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig141">Fig. 141b</a>) or potentiometry, enable to evaluate whether the cell performance can maintain <span class="italic">versus</span> time (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig141">Fig. 141b</a>),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1710"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1710</span></sup></a> and these durability aspects will be more thoroughly addressed in Section 11.3. Polarisation plots are at the basis of any performance characterisation for studies dealing with water electrolysis, but are not always performed in a correct manner, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, at sufficiently slow rate to avoid capacitive effects. There are indeed numbers of studies, where authors apply the measurement by using (cyclic) linear sweep voltammetry (CV/LSV) experiments at too high potential sweep rate, thereby resulting in pronounced capacitive currents. In such conditions, it is not unusual that some authors conclude that water electrolysis is possible below the thermoneutral voltage, which makes no sense, because some of the energy is provided to the water splitting in the form of heat, that is not quantified by the simple electrochemical signals (but that would definitely be consumed in real operation, at a cost). When the polarisation plot is properly acquired, it provides information regarding the various faradaic contributions to the cell characteristics. However, this information is not directly available without extra-analyses. For example, the raw polarisation plot depends on the whole cell (the contributions from the two electrodes cannot be separated) and is non-negligibly affected by the high-frequency resistance of the cell.</span>

        <span>In complement to 2-electrode cell measurements (which are possible at industrial facilities), laboratory researchers usually perform 3-electrode cell measurements, in which they independently control the potential of the working electrode (WE) and counter-electrode (CE) <span class="italic">versus</span> a properly chosen reference-electrode (RE). The nature and position of the RE should be optimal to enable noiseless measurements, and not bias the operation of the WE (it shall not mask the surface of the WE to avoid disturbance of the current lines, be sufficiently close of the WE to limit the Ohmic drop, and not lead to the pollution of the electrolyte, which is possible <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, with Cl<small><sup>−</sup></small> containing references, Cl<small><sup>−</sup></small> being a poison to many electrocatalysts encountered in water electrolysis, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Pt<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1742"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1742</span></sup></a>). By using a RE, the electrochemical signal of the WE can be isolated from that of the CE, and Ohmic-drop correction can be performed in a dynamic manner (although this can yield difficulties under bubbles evolution regime, where the conductivity of the electrolyte may non-negligibly change in operation, hence rendering awkward precise and direct Ohmic-drop correction). Three-electrode cell measurements are also compatible with experiments in which the CE compartment is separated from the working electrode (by a membrane or a glass frit), thereby limiting the influence of the CE (because it produces by-products in operation) on the behaviour of the working electrode. Nevertheless, it is always required to adopt the “proper” CE, both in terms of nature of its constitutive material, and in terms of surface area (so that the potential difference between the WE and CE is not limited by the compliance of the potentiate, which can become critical if large currents are experienced and/or if the Ohmic drop is non-negligible). The nature of the CE should be chosen to sustain the WE current (not to be counter-electrode limited) and does not pollute the electrolyte by products of its major or side reactions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1743"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1743</span></sup></a> In that prospect, metallic CE may dissolve, hence favouring deposits at the WE surface, this phenomenon being likely when the working electrode is in reduction (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, under HER) and the counter electrode in oxidation (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, OER in competition with metal dissolution). This effect is well-known by the community and recalled in several “good practice papers”.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1744"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1744,1745</span></sup></a> It can nevertheless be used as an advantage to “activate” an electrode at minimal materials’ cost<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1269</span></sup></a> (in that case using the dissolution of a Pt CE to provoke subtle deposition of Pt at the WE surface), even though plenty examples of the literature suffer such effect in an uncontrolled manner (not even evoked by their authors).</span>

          <span>Sonochemistry is a relatively new concept that received attention in the late 1970's and has been defined as the application of ultrasound in chemistry. In the late 1980's and early 1990's, the area was revived by Mason<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1843"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1843</span></sup></a> and Suslick.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1844"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1844</span></sup></a> The significant effects caused by acoustic cavitation in a liquid is the “Sonochemistry and Sonoluminesence”.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1843"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1843–1845</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Acoustic cavitation of an ultrasonicated liquid can be defined as the activation of pre-existing nuclei to form stable or transient bubbles in the liquid. These cavitation bubbles usually contain gas molecules such as N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and other gases as well as vapour from the liquid. When these bubbles grow in size, they become unstable and then violently collapse creating localised transient high temperatures and pressures at STP. The collapsing of these acoustic bubbles on a solid surface also leads to the formation of microjets being directed towards the surface of the solid material at speeds of up to 200 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. It is well-accepted in the field that the cavitation bubble collapse leads to near adiabatic heating of the vapour that is inside the bubble, creating the so-called “hotspot” in the liquid, where: (1) high temperatures (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 5000 K) and high pressures (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 2000 atms) are generated with a collision density of 1.5 kg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and pressure gradients of 2 TPa cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, with lifetimes shorter than 0.1 μs and cooling rates above 10<small><sup>9–10</sup></small> K s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> during the collapsing of cavitation bubbles.

          <p class="otherpara">As a conclusion to this section, it must be mentioned that, although many different physic-assisted water electrolysis concepts have been successfully demonstrated, the net gain in efficiency has not be precisely quantified, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the cost of generation of the physical signal has not been optimised (and in some case evaluated) <span class="italic">versus</span> the gain in electrochemical output. In essence, doing so is not easy, especially at the laboratory scale, and only well-dimensioned setups (production plants) will enable really assessing where the game is worth to be played. So, there is a wealth of technological and industrial studies that need to be achieved prior these physics-assisted water electrolysis processes become an industrial reality.</p>

      <h2 id="sect9730"><span class="a_heading">13 Water splitting from seawater, wastewater and other non-pure sources</span></h2>
      <span>The electrochemical splitting of pure water requires substantial electrical input energy, since the resistance of pure water is 18 MΩ cm. In contrast, the resistance of tap water and seawater are up to six orders of magnitude lower (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sub>Seawater</sub></small> = 20 Ω cm) which, viewed from the perspective of conductivity, in principle allows energy efficient splitting of water. Sea water covers nearly 70% of the earth's surface and presents the most abundant aqueous feedstock on earth (∼97% of the total water<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1848"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1848</span></sup></a>). In areas where fresh water is scarce, the direct use of seawater is advantageous to avoid the costs of water treatment. However, seawater is highly corrosive and contains Cl<small><sup>−</sup></small><img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1849"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1849</span></sup></a> (3.5% average global salinity) and microorganisms<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1850"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1850</span></sup></a> that can impact metal corrosion. Especially the chloride anions (∼0.5 M in seawater) poses serious challenges for the OER electrode that is set to oxidative hence positive potentials. Parasitic electrochemical reactions can occur on the anode and may lead to side products like chlorine or binary Cl–O compounds. Perhaps these reasons are basically responsible that the number of reports dedicated to electrocatalysis of seawater remains till to date within a manageable range.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit503"><sup><span class="sup_ref">503,1851–1861,1864,1868</span></sup></a> Oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution will in general always compete with each other, and since chlorine is a valuable intermediate in industry, it depends on perspective to decide whether OER or CER is the undesirable parasitic reaction.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1862"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1862,1863</span></sup></a> It is therefore understandable that electrocatalysts that are able to selectively support or suppress one or the other reaction are of great interest.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1862"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1862</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">The authors dare to say that, whenever hydrogen is intended to be produced electrochemically, the OER will be (compared to CER) the preferred other water-splitting half-cell reaction because transportation of chlorine is difficult and the projected hydrogen demand is enormous and hard to bring in line with the local chlorine demand.</p>

The criteria related to the environmental factor must focus on aspects that could affect the environment in some way and criteria belonging to the social factor assess the risk of harm that could arise for workers and are specific to each technology.

        <span>While capital costs are important, they are only one component of the overall lifetime cost. The total cost of construction and operation – and thus the cost of hydrogen produced – also depends primarily on the cost of electricity purchased, and on technical parameters such as the cell efficiency and lifetime.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Just as renewable and conventional power stations can be summarised by their levelised cost of energy (LCOE), the total cost of electrolysis can be summarised by the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), also known as the levelised cost of gas (LCOG). This quantifies the total cost of production discounted over the system's lifetime, per unit of hydrogen generated (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, $ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> or $ MW<small><sup>−1</sup></small>)</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The LCOH provides a fair comparison by factoring in all technical and economic parameters: capital cost, operating costs, production efficiency, system lifetime, performance degradation and the cost of energy used. This concept can be used to explore important trade-offs, for example the use of better materials to increase the durability or efficiency of the system. This will likely increase the capital cost but reduce operating costs due to less maintenance required or less electricity needing to be purchased.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">If green hydrogen is produced from hard-linking wind or solar PV with an electrolyser, the lowest cost hydrogen production requires consideration of the trade-off between installed solar/wind capacity and installed electrolysis capacity: this governs the average utilisation rate of the electrolyser.</p>

The utilisation rate of the electrolyser would be the same as the capacity factor of the wind. To achieve higher electrolyser utilisation and to decrease the levelised electrolyser capex, higher quantities of wind must be installed. The increase in utilisation will be governed by the wind output curve and installing extra capacity will yield an oversupply of electricity at some points during the year. This oversupply could be exported if there is an available connection or used on-site, otherwise it would have to be curtailed.

      <h2 id="sect10406"><span class="a_heading">15 Summary and outlook</span></h2>
      <span>In the present contribution, water electrolysis is addressed in a comprehensive manner, with insights spanning from textbook knowledge to the latest scientific strategies and industrial developments. The contribution bases its argumentation on thorough and relevant literature on the topic, and details key aspects of water electrolysis in 14 sections.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Firstly, Section 2 gave insight into the fundamentals of the two reactions that take place in water electrolysers: the HER at the negative electrode (where H<small><sub>2</sub></small> is produced) and the OER at the positive electrode (where O<small><sub>2</sub></small> is produced). The basic mechanisms of these reactions are given, with special insights into their limiting steps, which enables to pave the way to optimised electrocatalysts discovery and better electrode engineering.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 3 overviewed the various water electrolyser technologies; while high-temperature systems (solid oxide electrolyser cell (SOEC), proton conducting ceramic electrolyser cell (PCCEC)) are in-principle more efficient, they are also submitted to harsh materials constraints, which requires a wealth of engineering optimisation and until now prevented their commercialisation. Molten carbonate electrolyser cell (MCEC), although less studied from a scientific perspective (the materials issues seem handleable), received increasing attention on the industrial side recently, and could become commercial in a close future. Low-temperature water electrolysers are now commercial. Alkaline water electrolyser (AWE) are commercialised since decades and AWE systems are robust and do not depend on platinum group metals, but are also less intensive and efficient, incompatible with intermittent operation and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> compression, unlike their proton exchange membrane counterparts (PEMWE). The latter enable better performances, but are limited by the costs of their constitutive materials. Last, anion exchange membrane water electrolysers (AEMWE), although still at their infancy, could combine the interests of AWE (no PGM catalysts) and of PEMWE (thin membrane for good gas separation, compatibility with intermittency and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> compression); intense research efforts are presently devoted to PEMWEs and AEMWEs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 4 listed key performance indicators (KPI) and technology targets for these systems, with special emphasis to low-temperature water electrolysers, which have more chance to meet wide-scale commercialisation in the next decade.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 5 emphasised the need of research in terms of materials science and electrochemistry for the various technologies evaluated in this review. Then, Sections 6–8 focused on practical research efforts for the various families of electrode materials that are (or could be) employed in low-temperature water electrolysers.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 6 starts by a short review of state-of-the-art PGM-based catalysts for the HER and OER. It emphasises the fact that, if their today's performances are acceptable, the target is to keep these performances at smaller PGM-loading, which can be achieved by downsizing the particles/crystallites size, and/or alloying the active material (Pt, Ir) with less costly elements, and/or supporting them on stable conductive substrates (two strategies which may influence the activity and stability of the obtained composite, in good or in bad). The poor abundance of PGM in the Earth's crust motivates the search for alternative (non-PGM-based) catalysts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 7 reported about the very comprehensive literature dealing with PGM-free based HER and OER electrocatalysts; obviously, many of the references are related to materials for AWEs (and AEMWEs), but some of it also addresses PEMWEs. Among this rich literature, some concerns metal dioxides as OER and HER electrocatalysts (PbO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as electrode material for oxygen evolution). Metal oxides in the perovskite or spinel structure as OER and HER electrocatalysts are also surveyed, as well as transition metal layered double hydroxide OER catalysts for alkaline electrolytes. Finally, a rather recently-investigated class of non-PGM materials will be evaluated as well: steel-based electrodes for both HER and OER electrocatalysis. All these materials (and in particular the transition metal layered double hydroxides and steels) will have a chance to be employed in future A(EM)WE systems. As far as PEMWEs are concerned, durability issues when using non-PGM are a bit harder to handle, and these materials should not be used in such systems in the next decade.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Because metals in general may experience scarcity if used at the large scale (even for the non-PGM) mentioned in Section 7, Section 8 addressed the intense research efforts of the scientific community into metal-free (or with ultra-small metal content) HER and OER electrocatalysts. Catalysts with a carbon skeletal structure are dealt with first, and then heteroatom-doped carbons for OER, bifunctional catalysts and catalysts with a carbon-nitrogen skeletal structure, such as carbon nitride-graphene composites-based catalysts with high N content. Although not deployed industrially, these materials may be part of the solution in the long-term.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Since the performance of a given catalyst in a real water electrolysis cell depends not only on its intrinsic activity but also (and very importantly) on the way it is used in gas generating electrodes, Section 9 provides detailed basic concepts of 2D and 3D-electrode preparation. The section highlighted manners to elaborate HER and OER catalysts, but also how to prepare electrodes and membrane electrode assemblies to be used in practical systems.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Molecular compounds for HER and OER is a topic where the research community is very productive. Inspired by nature, these materials have some assets (selectivity, turnover frequency), but the poor accessibility of their active site and low durability are two real challenges to their practical usage. They were surveyed in Section 10.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 11 reviewed methods to characterise both electrocatalysts materials and electrodes. These span from two-electrode cell characterisations of the full electrolysis cell (possible in real system), three-electrode cell characterisations of individual electrodes (usually performed at the laboratory scale in more model conditions); importantly, physicochemical techniques coupled to electrochemistry are also addressed, the literature being extremely rich on the subject, because these are mandatory characterisations to unveil how water electrolysers and their core materials operate, a prerequisite to mechanisms determination and materials/structures optimisation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 12 then evaluated how externally-applied fields like mechanical stirring, magnetic field and ultrasound could enhance water splitting, these strategies usually being applied for low-temperature cells.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Finally, because purified-water is by far not the most abundant and easily-available on the planet, Section 13 focused on water splitting from non-pure water (saline water, seawater, neutral water pH, wastewater), while Section 14 provided a solid cost-analysis.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The wealth of information contained in this review shows how dynamic research is on the topic of water electrolysis. It makes clear that materials science and electrochemistry are at the basis of new discoveries of more efficient electrode/electrolyte materials, but one must not lose sight that engineering of these materials is also mandatory to turn them into long-lasting efficient electrodes for water splitting.</p>
      
        <h3 id="sect10429"><span class="b_heading">Outlook</span></h3>
        <span>The recent abnormal climatic episodes experienced in summer 2021 in Germany/Belgium (extreme flooding) and USA/Canada (severe droughts and subsequent gigantic forest fires) made even clearer the sad reality of major climate disturbance on our planet. It makes no doubt it is caused by global warming, itself related to major release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. The strategy to mitigate this issue is clear: the greenhouse gases emissions must be (very) significantly cut. One manner to do so is to rely more on renewable energies, which implies that renewable electricity is efficiently stored at the large scale and the long-term. <span class="italic">Power-to-hydrogen</span> (and then conversion of hydrogen into electricity in fuel cells) is an obvious strategy to that goal.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Water electrolysis when driven by renewable electricity represents a green, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> footprint free <span class="italic">power-to-hydrogen</span> route. To effectively counteract global temperature rise, greenhouse gas reducing techniques must be enforced internationally or, in other words, water electrolysis will only make a substantial contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions if it is widely deployed. The cross-border application of water electrolysis technologies however presupposes that it can be adapted to the different circumstances of the countries (costs for electricity, global solar radiation, availability of wind-active centers, availability of water). A technology always has the best chance of asserting itself if it is cheaper than competing processes, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, in this case water electrolysis needs to become more economical than processes that are based on the exploitation of oil, coal and natural gas, this being completely independent on the fact that the last-mentioned methods counteract the goal of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. The economy of water electrolysis is not only determined by the physical-chemical efficiency based on the cell voltage necessary to end up in a certain current density in combination with the charge to gas conversion rate. In addition to the durability of the electrode material in particular and the overall maintenance costs, the acquisition costs due to the electrode materials and the device design also play a role. Nevertheless, optimization of water electrolysis electrodes, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the improvement of OER and HER electrocatalysts and the intensification of the electrocatalyst-conductive support interaction is and remains amongst the most important adjustment screw that needs to be turned in order to make a significant leap towards highly efficient electrocatalytic water splitting.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Some of the authors have worked extensively on perovskite-based OER electrode materials. Many recently published articles report on composite materials containing perovskite as the active component for the OER. Although much research effort has been devoted to the development of OER-active perovskites, we believe that the development of composites that support perovskites as the OER electrocatalyst and ensures an intense, synergistic interaction between the electrocatalyst and the conductive support or at the electrocatalyst/interlayer interface, is a sensible strategy worth pursuing. This certainly also applies to spinel-based water-splitting electrodes. More complex spinel-containing hybrid materials have recently emerged as highly efficient supported OER catalysts. Further strategies to increase the number of OER active sites as <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, cations filling of unoccupied interstices leading to cationic misalignment need to be implemented into a broader spectrum of spinel for OER electrocatalysis. In addition, spinel-type materials are promising HER supporting materials giving them bifunctionality.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A more thorough investigation of effects that occur when nonmetals such as S, P are incorporated into transition-metal based spinels could lead to a more informed knowledge-based development of useful material design strategies and should result in more HER-active spinel's. However, currently metal pnictides, metal carbides, metal borides, metal chalcogenides are more competitive HER-promoting electrocatalysts; binary borides and carbides are among the best binary HER electrocatalysts in terms of both activity and durability. Among the materials that consist of metal elements and non-metal elements (main groups 3, 4, 5 and 6), hybrid composed phases with coexisting metallic and a non-metal rich phase belong to the absolute bench mark species. This has been shown, for example, for molybdenum nitride-based electrode materials. This concept should be extended and successfully transferred to other metal/nonmetal compounds. Besides the further understanding and improvement of well-established metal/non-metal based HER active compounds we recommend the more intensive investigation of up to now less investigated electrocatalytic active metal/non-metal composed compounds as for instance transition metal tellurides. From a theoretical point-of-view tellurides (in general) should not be less active than the lighter homologues of the sixth main group.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Steels have proven to be outstandingly efficient and outstandingly durable as electrode materials for water electrocatalysis. Recently, suspension-based approaches have emerged; <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, it has been found that transition metal oxides are reasonable additions to sulfuric acid-based electrolytes. Currently, however, the amount of solid material that needs to be added to the clear electrolyte to have the desired effect, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, to significantly reduce the overpotential required to achieve a given current density is high and is about 30 g per 100 mL of electrolyte. This means that adapting to current electrolyzer technologies is almost impossible. Therefore, scientists should aim to significantly reduce the required amount of added oxidic solid compound.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Generally, non-metal based electrocatalysts can still not compete with metal-based ones with respect to efficiency for OER or HER electrocatalysis. The improvement of the contact between conductive support and the periphery composed of the real catalytic active phase seems to be a promising route to increase the catalytic activity. Besides doping of the conductive host lattice, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, graphitic carbon nitride matrix with P or S or P and S was already found to be an effective way to manipulate electronic structure and electrochemical properties which means not only the increased catalytic efficiency but also the reduction of the intrinsic susceptibility for carbon to corrode in OER regime.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The authors think that the embedding of molecular compounds into conductive support might indeed become a promising strategy to result in effective (heterogeneous) water electrocatalysis. Thus, whenever molecular species are used in solid-state electrocatalysis, at least reasonable catalytic efficiency can be achieved. However, to date, molecular compounds that enable homogeneous water catalysis have not been able to represent a viable strategy to achieve competitive current densities at moderate overpotentials.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Besides the optimisation of the electrode materials there are several methods for reducing the total overpotential and total Ohmic resistance in water electrolysis, for example, by increasing the electrolyte movement (by using gravity, centrifugal acceleration field, mechanical stirring, magnetic field; employing ultrasound at the gas-evolving electrodes and electrolyte). These are promising strategies to further increase the efficiency of water electrolysis and in particular the combination of externally applied fields with newly developed state-of-the-art electrode materials and cell designs should be further investigated.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Among electrolyser technologies, in particular AEMWE is very promising in terms of total cost of ownership. Although this technique has been intensively investigated lately, studies on cell performance stability remain rare. The existing studies that comprise performance stability tests for AEMWE at constant current density showed a substantial reduction in already about 100 hours after commissioning, probably owing to chemical degradation of the anion conducting polymers at high pH value. Thus, on the one hand, further tests examining the durability of the membrane in long-term use are urgently needed, and further improvement of the membrane against base-related degradation must be tackled. Also, the interfacial contact between the anion-exchange membrane (AEM) and the catalytic layers need to be further optimized, as it can simply not be prepared by coupling conventional AWE electrodes with an AEM. These materials and chemical-engineering aspects should without any doubt be seriously handled by the research community in the future, if one wants to have AEMWEs at large for the storage of renewable electricity. The same applies as well for PEMWEs, the goal of engineering being in that case to lower the amount of PGM used in the electrodes and to reach longer service-life in real (renewable electricity storage) operation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally, and although this has not been amongst the primary points of focus of this review, working on system aspects, balance-of-plant and control and command of the water electrolyzer (regardless of the technology used) is not less important.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">We encourage the scientists involved in this striking field of research to avoid taking wrong turns. To give an example, water purification techniques have been very well established and with regard to economic criteria, direct saltwater electrolysis is almost always surpassed by a combination of the latest deionization technology plus alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) or proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. The authors therefore think that further investing resources in exploration of the direct electrolysis of seawater is at least worthy of discussion.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">This shows that, in the present times where hydrogen is called to become a major energy vector in our societies, the research community as a whole as multiple challenges to handle, which should find their solutions be a clever coupling between complementary multidisciplinary approaches spanning from basic materials sciences (electrocatalysis, polymer chemistry and physics), chemical and materials engineering all the way to mechanical and electrical engineering. This is the only solution by which the complex systems that are water electrolyzers will become sufficiently technologically-advanced and economically-viable to be deployed at large (and coupled to fuel cells or other hydrogen-using devices), an endeavor to lower our greenhouse gases emissions.</p>
