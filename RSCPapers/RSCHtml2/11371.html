      <h2 id="sect415"><span class="a_heading">1. Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>The transition towards a deeply decarbonized and sustainable energy system has become a defining challenge for human society in the 21st century.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> An increasingly tight global supply of traditional non-renewable energy supplies (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, oil, coal and natural gas) has provided an incentive for countries worldwide to develop new technologies to secure the energy supply.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> To exploit alternative sources to fossil fuels, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, tidal and geothermal power have set off a boom in recent years.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> However, these kinds of green energy are still subject to constraints in terms of reliability, economy and environmental impact. By contrast, nuclear fission has been universally acknowledged as a mature and safe technology that can produce energy with consistent output and minimal carbon footprints. The vigorous development of nuclear energy has made a vital contribution towards global low-carbon energy needs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">Uranium (U), as an essential resource for nuclear energy production, is of strategic importance to the sustainability of the global nuclear industry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> In recent years, the increasing scale of nuclear power has driven significant growth in reactor-related uranium demand. The dwindling availability of terrestrial uranium reserves, which are estimated to afford only about a century of consumption,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> thus has motivated considerable interest in identifying and utilizing unconventional uranium reserves. Uranium extraction from seawater (UES) has been highlighted as a potential approach to this end.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7,8</span></sup></a> There is about 4.5 billion tU in the ocean, nearly 1000 times more plentiful than the estimated amount of terrestrial uranium reserves (7.6 million tU) at present.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> This reserve presents a huge alternative reserve that can meet at least 10<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 years of global demand for uranium resources, provided that the development of chemical separation techniques allows an economically viable recovery. Meanwhile, an additional advantage of UES lies in the environmental benefit, which has a less negative impact on ecological systems as compared with terrestrial uranium mining.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Natural seawater is a complex biogeochemical system with an ultra-low concentration of U (∼3.3 ppb), accompanied by a great amount of competing metal ions, high salinity, specific pH conditions, and substantial marine biofouling,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> making UES a rather challenging task. To enrich the extremely dilute U from the vast oceans, an energy-saving and cost-efficient method is required. Among the well-established chemical separation techniques,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> adsorption has been demonstrated to be an adaptable and reliable approach with environmental friendliness for marine uranium enrichment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> As with every new technology that begins to gain widespread adoption, innovations in the design and optimization of new materials play a critical role in the advancement and development of this technology.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> Accordingly, the core job of developing adsorption techniques for UES has been focused on exploring high-performance adsorbent materials for uranium capture. The challenge as it stands is that adsorbent materials should have robust structures and exhibit remarkable properties, including adsorption capability, selectivity, biofouling resistance, and durability in seawater.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14,15</span></sup></a> Undoubtedly, the deliberate design and development of adsorbent materials are of central importance to guarantee the stable harvesting of marine uranium while accelerating the commercialization of UES.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The origin of UES dates back to the “Project Oyster” initiated by the United Kingdom in the early 1950s. Since the first public report by Davies <span class="italic">et al.</span> in 1964,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> UES has spurred considerable interest among research entities worldwide. Initially, numerous studies were performed to screen potential adsorbent materials. Inorganic adsorbents, particularly hydrous titanium dioxide, were one of the earliest materials that drew attention.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9,17–21</span></sup></a> These materials were ruled out in the 1980s due to their minimal adsorption capacity and poor mechanical resistance. The focus has then been turned to synthetic polymers, which represent the most promising adsorbents applicable for the large-scale marine test of UES. Specifically, the development of amidoxime (AO) derived polymers, ‘state-of-the-art materials’ for UES, has aroused a research upsurge that has continued over the past decades.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22–29</span></sup></a> Up to now, ongoing efforts have been made to construct AO-based polymeric adsorbents with improved properties. Meanwhile, emerging nanostructured materials in recent years, such as porous carbon materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), porous organic polymers (POPs), porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) and genetically-engineered proteins, have opened up a new avenue for the development of potential uranium adsorbents.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30–39</span></sup></a> Overall, with the evolution of adsorbent materials, significant achievements of UES, in terms of fundamental studies and marine engineering, have been made by scientists worldwide (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>). In particular, the past decade has been regarded as a ‘Golden Age’ of UES, as evidenced by the abundance of adsorbents studied in the literature and a series of milestone events in marine field tests.</p>

        <span>Strong adsorption towards U with a high capacity is the foremost important property of a potential adsorbent for UES. As the adsorption capacity towards uranium has been considered to be the main cost driver of UES, it has always been a top priority to improve the uranium uptake capability of adsorbent materials. In this subsection, based on an updated mechanistic understanding of the adsorption behaviours of well-developed adsorbents at the molecular, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels, the strategies established for improving the adsorption ability of uranium adsorbents will be elaborated. Specifically, the methods to promote the ligand–uranyl interactions, regulate the spatial conformation of polymeric adsorbents and improve the structural features of uranium adsorbents will be discussed.</span>

          <span id="sect527"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.1. How to promote ligand–uranyl interaction?. </span>
          <span>The adsorption capacity of uranium adsorbents is positively associated with the number of accessible ligands and their binding ability towards uranyl ions. During the evolution of uranium adsorbents, substantial efforts in the early days were made to introduce a maximum number of functional ligands to enhance uranium binding. Versatile polymerization techniques are employed to increase the grafting yield of polymeric adsorbents. The emergence of diverse porous organic frameworks provides new platforms to accommodate high-density ligands. Enhanced ligand–uranyl interaction is then achieved by rational molecular design and pore engineering of the frameworks. Besides, the introduction of collaborative functionalities adjacent to ligands has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to promoting the interaction with uranyl ions. Representative studies employing these methods or techniques to increase the adsorption capacity of uranium adsorbents are summarized in this subsection.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Firstly, due to the high affinity towards uranyl ions in a chelating coordination mode, amidoxime (AO) has been identified as one of the most effective ligands of uranium.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51–54</span></sup></a> A considerable number of AO-containing adsorbent materials, especially those with polymer matrixes, have been developed for UES.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The most studied AO-based polymers are generally prepared by grafting acrylonitrile (AN) monomers onto polyolefin supports with robust backbones, such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5A</a>).

The structure–property relationship of these adsorbents was then explored through X-ray crystallographic studies and DFT calculations (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7Db–d</a>). It was demonstrated that the introduction of auxiliary amino substituents facilitated lowering the charge on uranyl in the complex and could serve as a hydrogen bond acceptor, thus resulting in an increased affinity of AO towards uranyl.

          <p class="otherpara">Basically, well-established approaches to elevate the adsorption capacity of polymeric adsorbents towards uranium in seawater involve the tuning of the number, accessibility and synergistic binding ability of the functional ligands.

          <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, an important question that should be raised here is whether AO is the most optimal ligand for binding uranyl ions in seawater. As we know, AO ligands have been investigated for over 40 years, and have proved their high affinity towards uranyl ions in the marine environment. Meanwhile, polymeric adsorbents bearing AO ligands have been readily produced on a pilot scale for marine tests. Thus, AO ligands are still considered to be one category of the most effective ligands for UES. However, benefiting from the latest advancement in uranium coordination chemistry, new effective ligands and promising design principles, such as the preorganization of collaborative ligands, have been developed recently.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit104"><sup><span class="sup_ref">104–107</span></sup></a> More discussion in this regard will be presented in Section 3.2.3.

          <span>As evidenced in the aforementioned studies, a majority of the uranium adsorbents exhibited quite a poor adsorption ability in seawater due to the low utilization ratio of the functional ligands.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76,80</span></sup></a> The frustrating truth makes researchers examine the factors restricting the performance of polymer adsorbents for uranium adsorption. A critical issue involving the relationship between the accessibility of ligands and the spatial conformation of polymer chains has been more frequently realized. Polymer conformation refers to the spatial configuration of the constitutive atoms or atomic groups for a given, fixed connectivity, which is the molecular basis underlying essentially all physical properties of polymers while significantly affecting their functions. Since the ligands of the polymeric adsorbents are tethered to the polymer backbones, their accessibility and binding behaviours would be significantly influenced by the polymer chain conformation, which is tunable from a collapsed state to a stretched state. In addition, the adsorption of uranyl ions by polymeric adsorbents is a responsive process where the uranium center plays as a cross-linking point to form coordination with multiple ligands. This makes the variation of the polymer chain conformation a dynamic process because of the interchain crosslinking triggered by uranium binding.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14,108</span></sup></a> Therefore, developing viable strategies to tune the chain conformation is expected to improve the adsorption ability of polymeric adsorbents.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Since uranium adsorption is carried out in aqueous solutions, a basic approach to tune the chain conformation of polymeric adsorbents is to introduce a second monomer containing hydrophilic groups in the RIGP system. The hydrophilic groups provide a significantly-hydrated local environment around the functional ligands, promoting their accessibility to uranyl ions by improving the mass transfer resistance. The introduction of hydrophilic comonomers to synthesize polymeric adsorbents for UES was first conducted by Omichi and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55,56</span></sup></a> AO-functionalized PE fibers prepared by co-grafting of AN and hydrophilic monomers (AA or <span class="italic">N</span>,<span class="italic">N</span>-dimethyl-acrylamide (DMAAm)) were found to show a significantly improved ability for uranium uptake, compared to that of pristine AO-grafted polymers without hydrophilic chain segments.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In another representative work, Oyola and Dai systematically studied uranium recovery as a function of different hydrophilic components including AA, MA, vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA), vinyl phosphonic acid (VPA) and itaconic acid (ITA), which were co-grafted with AN through RIGP onto PE fibers with a “hollow-gear” shape (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8A</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> When exposed to simulated seawater, the uranium adsorption in terms of comonomer follows the order: AA &lt; VSA &lt; MAA &lt; ITA &lt; VPA (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8B</a>), while when contacted with real seawater after ∼11 weeks, a change in the performance was observed: MAA &lt; AA (Mohr's salt) &lt; VSA &lt; ITA (Mohr's salt) &lt; ITA &lt; VPA (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8C</a>). Obviously, the uranium adsorption capacity was related to the hydrophilic comonomers, and the PE fibers grafted with AN and ITA or VPA produced the highest performances for uranium.

          <p class="otherpara">To regulate the chain conformation of polymeric adsorbents to promote the accessibility and binding ability of tethered functional ligands, a brilliant alternative approach is to develop block copolymers (BCPs) containing hydrophilic comonomers by using diverse CRP techniques. Because of their well-defined structures with extraordinary compositional versatility, BCP-type adsorbents hold tremendous potential to afford maximum ligand availability while enabling a quantitative investigation of their structure–property relationship. A seminal work about BCP-type adsorbents was reported by Saito and co-workers combining the use of RIGP and ATRP.

          <p class="otherpara">Since bare hydrophilic comonomers have been verified to have no adsorption ability for uranium, their influence on the polymer chain conformation was further investigated. Preliminary results revealed that the enhancement in uranium absorption capacity was attributed to the more stretched conformation of the polymer brushes with the incorporation of hydrophilic PAA blocks. In their follow-up study, by using the neutron reflectometry (NR) technique, the effects of hydrophilic groups, alkali conditioning and metal-ion loading on the conformation of polymer adsorbents were further verified.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> Specifically, three series of adsorbents namely the pure PAO monoblock polymer, deuterated-PAO polyacrylic acid diblock copolymers (<span class="italic">d</span>-PAO-<span class="italic">b</span>-PAA) and the random copolymer configuration (PAO-<span class="italic">co</span>-PAA) were prepared through ATRP of AN or AN with <span class="italic">t</span>BA at different molar concentrations (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9Ba</a>). These adsorbents were deposited onto quartz substrates and were characterized by the NR technique in air and heavy water (D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9Bb</a>), in which the NR data of solvated samples were collected using a liquid cell (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9Bc</a>). The obtained NR revealed that the initial film thickness of pure PAO and PAO-<span class="italic">co</span>-PAA samples with similar molecular weights and grafting densities extended from 95 Å thickness in the air to 180 and 280 Å in D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, respectively, suggesting that the incorporation of hydrophilic segments on the polymer would cause swelling of the polymer, which reduced the barrier to uranium diffusion, and in turn increased the uranium adsorption capacity. Moreover, the <span class="italic">d</span>-PAO thickness in both diblock samples increased by ∼100% and ∼150% in D<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, while the PAA swelled by ∼180% and ∼170%, respectively, relative to their thickness in the air. Additionally, the shrinking of the diblock copolymer was observed after alkali treatment and during metal ion adsorption, although it was not yet clear which metal ion was responsible for it.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In a concurrent report, Xie and colleagues conducted a study employing the <span class="italic">in situ</span> NR technique to probe the conformational behaviour of poly(acrylamidoxime) (PAAO) brushes in water, focusing on the change in polymer chain conformation before and after uranyl ion adsorption.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> The NR profiles were obtained by the measurements of the PAAO film both in air and in an aqueous solution.

After exposure to 10 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> UO<small><sub>2</sub></small>(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small> solution, the height of the PAAO brushes increased significantly by 5 nm, while continuing to increase the UO<small><sub>2</sub></small>(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration to 100 ppm, only a slight increase was observed (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9C</a>). A speculation was provided by the authors based on these results that due to the strong complexation between uranyl ions and AO groups, a shrinkage of the PAAO brushes occurred when uranyl ions were adsorbed, resulting in a collapse or more compact conformation of the polymer brushes. Concomitantly, the expulsion of the uranium solution from PAAO brushes was also observed, which further hindered the diffusion and adsorption of uranium. However, the uranium adsorption capacity increased with the increase in UO<small><sub>2</sub></small>(NO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration, indicating that a new balance between the adsorption and expulsion of uranium solution induced by shrinkage of PAAO brushes was established before reaching the theoretical adsorption capacity. These results increased the mechanistic understanding of the adsorption of uranium to PAAO polymers.

The swelling behaviour was expected to facilitate the uranium adsorption by decreasing the resistance of uranium into the swollen-layer. More importantly, the conformation of the molecular chain underwent a significant change, from the collapsed conformation to an extended conformation, as indicated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9De</a>, leading to an increased collision probability between uranium and the functional group.

          <p class="otherpara">In brief, the polymer chain conformation exerts a significant influence on the adsorption ability. The hydrophilic component in the polymer affects the structure of grafting chains, putatively leading to interesting morphological phenomena, which have received increasing attention in the past five years. As clearly demonstrated, tuning the chain conformation of polymers can help to afford maximum ligand availability, and thus improve the interaction with uranium. However, the studies reported so far have only superficially grazed the influence of the chain conformation on the adsorption of uranium. In future work, it is necessary to combine the fundamental analysis based on polymer solution physics and classical adsorption theories to establish the relationship between the structure, conformation and adsorption behaviours of polymers. In addition, pivotal information on the polymer chain conformation in aqueous environments can be obtained with the aid of computational simulation and NR techniques, which would inspire the design of high-performance polymeric adsorbents.

          <span>Since adsorbent materials have diverse forms such as fibers, powders, monoliths, hydrogels and membranes, shaping their structure represents another effective approach for increasing their adsorption capacity towards uranium. Particular interest has been put to improve the surfaces and porosity of solid adsorbents. This will maximize the exposure of ligands to uranyl ions while facilitating the mass transfer process. Generally, adsorbents with high specific surface area (SSA) are expected to achieve a high DOG, thus providing abundant adsorption sites for uranyl binding. Therefore, shaping the adsorbent to increase the SSA appears to be one of the feasible ways to improve its adsorption efficiency. To this end, various effective means have been adopted to increase the SSA of fiber adsorbents, mainly involving changing the cross-sectional shape,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119,120</span></sup></a> reducing the diameter of fibers,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121–126</span></sup></a> or a combination of the two. Besides, adsorbents with implementable structures such as sponges, hydrogels and membranes have been exploited with high SSA and high affinity to uranium. This section offers an elaboration on strategies utilized to improve the structural features of representative adsorbents for enhancing their adsorption ability.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">First, it is generally accepted that the substrate materials of adsorbents with high SSA can afford maximum ligand availability. Accordingly, changing the cross-sectional shape of fibers is considered to be an effective way to increase the SSA of the adsorbents. This was demonstrated by Omichi and co-worders<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> who synthesized adsorbents by grafting PAN onto PP fiber substrates with either a round or cross-shaped sectional view. Results showed that the adsorbent with the cross-shaped support with a larger SSA exhibited a superior uranium uptake to the adsorbent with the round-shaped support. Moreover, higher recovery of uranium was achieved by decreasing the diameter of adsorbents with round-shaped fiber supports, verifying the effect of SSA on uranium adsorption. Subsequently, the role of the geometry of trunk fibers in uranium recovery was also evaluated in Oyola's work,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a> in which AN<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>MA at a ratio of 70<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>30 was first grafted onto a series of PE fibers with a round morphology and varying diameters, followed by amidoximation and adsorption tests in 8 ppm uranium solution. It was generally found that smaller-diameter fibers exhibited a higher adsorption capacity than larger-diameter fibers. The adsorption of uranium increased from 30 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to 140 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> when the diameter decreased from 20 mm to 0.24 mm. Additionally, the uptake capacity of non-round-shaped trunk fibers was also explored where a fiber with a hollow gear shape as a PE trunk outperformed other non-round-shaped fibers, affording a uranium uptake of 188.1 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, while quasi-trilobal shaped adsorbents only showed an adsorption capacity of 20 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. In addition to the high SSA of the hollow gear adsorbent, the hollow interior also allowed increasing access to the AO groups, which increased the adsorption sites, thereby improving the uranium adsorption capacity.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">Likewise, solution blow spinning (SBS) is also a versatile method for preparing nanofiber adsorbents, owing to its unique advantages such as no requirement of a high direct current voltage source and electrically conductive collector, and no limitation for the thickness of nanofibers deposited on the collector.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125–127</span></sup></a> In a landmark example, Wang and co-workers developed a novel pre-amidoximation with a SBS strategy to massively fabricate poly(imide dioxime) nanofiber (labelled PIDO NF) adsorbents for UES (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11Ba</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> Unlike the conventional AO-based adsorbents obtained by post-amidoximation treatment of nitrile functionalized fibers, in this work, the amidoximation of PAN raw material was first carried out through hydroxylamine treatment in organic solvent (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, DMF, DMSO). The obtained PIDO solution was then injected into a multi-nozzle system and stretched by the compressed air flow, and aligned fibers were continuously deposited on a rolling drum to form a uniform fiber mat (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11Bb</a>). The obtained nanofibers have an average diameter of 406.13 ± 28.35 nm and a BET surface area of 28.42 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11Bc</a>). Good extendibility and mechanical properties of the wet PIDO NF mat samples were also observed from an obvious necking phenomenon (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11Bd–f</a>), which were beneficial for practical adsorption application in seawater. Subsequently, the adsorption performance of the obtained PIDO NF was tested in both uranium spiked and non-spiked seawater, which was collected from coastal water near the Boundary Island of the South China Sea. Combined with the full coverage of imide dioxime sites, the favourable characteristics of 3D porous architecture, excellent hydrophilicity, and high SSA, the PIDO NF showed an adsorption capacity up to 951 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in 8 ppm uranium-spiked natural seawater. More importantly, the adsorption capacity of the PIDO NF for uranium reached 8.74 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 56 d contact with real seawater in the field column test, which represented a high adsorption value among the fabric adsorbents.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Building on this work, a modified aqueous solution blow spinning (ASBS) strategy was developed by the same team for the synthesis of PAO-based nanofibers (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11Ca</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> Similarly, a pre-amidoximation process of PAN was carried out to prepare the PAO precursor. While the amidoximation product PAO is not soluble in deionized water, the good solubility of PAO in alkaline solutions enables the possibility for the preparation of PAO-based nanofibers from aqueous solutions, rather than an organic solvent, which could avoid environmental impacts and reduce the cost. Alginate (Alg) was then chosen as a supporting component for hybrid nanofibers and a small amount of polyethylene oxide (PEO) was employed as an accessory ingredient to increase the spinnability of the polymer mixture. Accordingly, PAO was mixed with Alg and PEO in an alkaline aqueous solution to prepare the feed polymer solution, which was fed to the nozzles and then stretched rapidly; the PAO/Alg/PEO nanofibers were continuously deposited on a rolling collector through the ASBS process (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11Cb</a>). Furthermore, an <span class="italic">in situ</span> crosslink treatment was performed by introducing calcium chloride (5 wt%) solution into the PAO/Alg/PEO NFs to enhance their water-stability and mechanical stability. At the same time, PEO was washed out during the crosslinking process due to its water-soluble property. Significantly, obvious changes in morphology and structure were observed after crosslinking, where the diameter of the dry fibers decreased from 402.15 ± 10.75 nm to 300.25 ± 16.35 nm (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11Cc and d</a>), resulting in an increase of SSA from 5.8 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 33.7 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for PAO/Alg/PEO NFs and PEO removed PAO/Alg NFs, respectively. When investigated for uranium recovery, a saturation capacity of 892.77 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 8.42 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained for PAO/Alg NFs from 8 ppm U-spiked seawater and 8 tons of non-spiked natural seawater, respectively. These novel SBS strategies show great potential in the preparation of new generation uranium adsorbents for UES.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Aside from reducing the diameter of trunk fibers, a novel strategy to increase the SSA of the grafting chain was proposed by Xu and co-workers to prepare high SSA AO-based polymeric (H-ABP) fibers to increase the uranium adsorption capacity while maintaining their mechanical properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> Specifically, a 3D hierarchically porous H-ABP fiber was fabricated <span class="italic">via</span> self-assembly of axial grafting chains.

Additionally, the directional channels of the DC-PAO hydrogel could be well-maintained in seawater. This carefully-designed structure provided favourable transport channels for the rapid migration of uranyl ions into the hydrogel networks, affording a high transpiration-enhanced uranium adsorption ability together with an ultra-efficient solar desalination performance.

Based on the results of the laboratory test, marine field experiments were further carried out in different sea areas in China. Similarly, the polyphenol-functionalized membrane displayed high selectivity, high extraction efficiency and high permeate flux in the actual seawater test. After processing 10 L of seawater from the East China Sea, a total uranium mass of 27.81 μg with an extraction rate of 84% was acquired, and the extraction rate could also reach more than 80% even after 10 extraction cycles (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14D–F</a>).

The deployment and cost of uranium extraction from real seawater using a polyphenol-functionalized membrane were estimated under the assumption that different potential energy drives were used. Compared with the passive adsorption of uranium in seawater, the integration of additional energy-driven systems with adsorbents could improve the uranium extraction efficiency, offering a promising solution to UES. Meanwhile, the results showed that the final cost of uranium production could be significantly reduced by integrating the membrane-based separation system with a natural tide-driven process or a desalination plant-integrated process (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14H</a>).</p>

This design allowed the high mobility of uranium in the AO-PIM-1 membrane while maintaining the high SSA for improving the uranium adsorption potential. Adsorption experiments were subsequently carried out to evaluate the practical performances of the AO-PIM-1 membrane.

However, the trade-off between these structural advantages and mechanical strength needs to be considered. The development of hydrogel-based adsorbents for UES is an active attempt, considering the simple synthesis of hydrogels with hydrophilic 3D networks. Nevertheless, owing to their low mechanical strength and salt resistance, whether hydrogel materials can meet the requirements of field tests of UES remains to be further explored. In addition, exploiting the membrane technology for UES is still in its infancy. On the one hand, functionalized membranes with high affinity and selectivity to uranium are scarcely reported, not to mention the biofouling problem. On the other hand, energy-consuming systems are required to be integrated with the membrane modules.

Thanks to advances in protein engineering, renewed interests have emerged over the past decade in the engineering of biological systems including peptides and proteins with intriguing properties for selective recognition of uranium from seawater.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141,142,178–184</span></sup></a></span>

          <p class="otherpara">Fundamentally, improving the selectivity of uranium adsorbents relies on the engineering of uranyl–ligand interactions to reach a more thermodynamically stable (energetically favoured) state. Based on the latest insights into the coordination chemistry of uranium, promising approaches have been proposed to address the traditional concern for the competition of vanadium ions. More importantly, a nascent concept to tune the preorganization of the binding sites has uncovered a new paradigm in the design of uranium adsorbents with high selectivity. By regulating the spatial arrangement of ligands and their coordinative binding to uranium, a series of customized uranyl nanotraps mimicking the binding motifs found in biomacromolecules have been designed, exhibiting precise recognition of uranyl ions. This principle for material design is important but still in its infancy. More in-depth studies are needed to reveal the subtle structures of the uranyl–ligand complexes in biological substances to optimize the preorganization principle for developing more advanced uranium adsorbents.</p>

          <span>The “defending” strategy is to prevent the attachment or adhesion of marine organisms on the adsorbent's surface.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253–259</span></sup></a> Adsorbents with anti-adhesion properties are usually prepared by incorporating super-hydrophilic functional groups, which reduce the interactions between the adsorbents and microorganisms, and then prevent their adhesion onto the surfaces.

          <p class="otherpara">Taking that into account, Bai and colleagues reported an adsorbent with anti-adhesion properties for UES.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> A robust montmorillonite-polydopamine/polyacrylamide (MMT-PDA/PAM) nanocomposite hydrogel was prepared <span class="italic">via</span> a two-step process in which PDA was first intercalated into MMT nanosheets, and then a solution composed of monomers AM, initiator APS and crosslinking agent BIS was subjected to free radical polymerization to obtain the final hydrogel adsorbent (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29A</a>). The best performing adsorbent had a 10 wt% content of MMT and 0.6 wt% of DA content, and was denoted as MMT<small><sub>10</sub></small>-PDA<small><sub>0.6</sub></small>/PAM. By comparison, the MMT<small><sub>10</sub></small>-PDA<small><sub>0.6</sub></small> and MMT<small><sub>10</sub></small>/PAM were also prepared without the addition of the AM and DA, respectively. The adsorption capacity of these adsorbents was examined as a function of pH over the range of 3.0–8.5 in deionized water. The uranium uptake increased from pH 3.0 to 6.5, with the maximum capacity achieved at pH 6.5, then dropped slightly with a further increase in pH. A saturation capacity of 229.08 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of the MMT<small><sub>10</sub></small>-PDA<small><sub>0.6</sub></small>/PAM hydrogel was obtained, which was higher than those of MMT<small><sub>10</sub></small>-PDA<small><sub>0.6</sub></small> and MMT<small><sub>10</sub></small>/PAM.

          <p class="otherpara">Altogether, the ubiquitous microorganisms in the oceans bring serious biofouling to materials applied in marine engineering, which has been a tremendous challenge for UES. Various “attacking” and “defending” strategies mentioned above have been proposed to cope with the challenge. As for the former active bactericidal strategy, one concern is that killed bacteria can act as nutrients for bacterial growth, while the latter passive antifouling strategy may lack the ability to resist the dead bacterial cells that are already deposited on the surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit203"><sup><span class="sup_ref">203</span></sup></a> Therefore, adsorbents relying on a single antifouling mechanism cannot always meet the needs of different occasions.

Meanwhile, versatile antibacterial components can be incorporated into the adsorbents to generate multifunctional surfaces.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, since the dominant biofouling species affecting uranium recovery from the oceans are unclear, antibacterial agents with broad-spectrum antibacterial characteristics are usually selected. The Gram-negative <span class="italic">E. coli</span> and Gram-positive <span class="italic">S. aureus</span> are often used as model bacteria for antibacterial research. However, the dominant target biofouling species are variable corresponding to the surface chemistry and structural features of the different uranium adsorbents. Identifying dominant bacterial species affecting uranium recovery is conducive to designing antifouling adsorbents for targeting specific biofouling bacteria. Last but not least, current antimicrobial evaluation experiments are basically carried out on a laboratory scale. However, in fact, biofouling is derived from the oceans, and the complex marine biological system brings more uncertainties and challenges. Therefore, future research on antimicrobial assessment should be performed in the open marine environment to verify the practical application performance of the adsorbents.</p>

        <h3 id="sect1914"><span class="b_heading">3.4. Strategies for improving durability</span></h3>
        <span>The stability of an adsorbent under realistic marine conditions is an essential issue that needed to be taken into consideration in the practical deployment of adsorbents.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> The adsorbents without structural stability might undergo degradation or the loss of functional components over prolonged seawater exposure, which will compromise their extraction ability towards uranium and raise the cost of UES. On the other hand, it may also bring about environmental concerns owing to the leaching of the components of adsorbents. To date, the potential of numerous inorganic adsorbents, polymers and nanostructured materials for UES has been extensively reported, while few results concerning their structural stability have been obtained in realistic marine tests.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit58"><sup><span class="sup_ref">58,65,69,71,114,216,218,231</span></sup></a> It is well documented that, for inorganic materials, their poor durability and their instability under basic conditions limit their large-scale application in ocean environments. Besides, although the various appealing characteristics have made many nanostructured materials (typically, porous framework materials, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, MOFs) interesting and potential in UES application, their chemical stability remains a tough challenge since a few of dative bonds in these materials could survive in the seawater environment with high-ionic-strength. To address this problem, strategies have been proposed to engineer the organic struts of the frameworks. However, the synthesis of these materials on an industrial scale is a huge challenge. From the perspective of durability, it is more practical to use polymer adsorbents for uranium recovery from seawater because of their stable covalently-bonded structures. Specifically, polymeric hosts with high mechanical strength are preferred.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Another issue related to material durability that must be considered is the structural stability of adsorbents in the elution process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> Since the ultimate goal of UES is to obtain high-concentration uranium products, uranium must be effectively eluted from the adsorbents.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> Meanwhile, the adsorbent should be regenerated for cycle use in marine tests, so as to minimize the cost of UES. This requires the development of relatively mild but efficient elution procedures. Conventionally, uranium adsorbed onto AO-based fibers was eluted through strong acid leaching (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, HCl, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265,266</span></sup></a> The advantage of the acid elution approach is that the uranium recovery rate is high, but it causes significant damage to the fibers, leading to the decrease of adsorption performances in cycle use.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> On the other hand, though AO ligands exhibit high stability in seawater environments, they are susceptible to decomposition through hydrolysis during the acid elution process, which is responsible for the degraded extraction performances of recycled AO-based adsorbents.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267,268</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">After acid elution, an alkaline (typically KOH) reconditioning process at elevated temperature (usually 80 °C) is always required for the regeneration of the adsorbent.

The high efficiency of this elution strategy was attributed to the formation of the stable uranyl tris-carbonato complex in the pH range of 7–9.

More efforts are needed to improve the stability of ligands and the durability of the adsorbents, as well as to avoid the destruction of the physicochemical properties of the adsorbents during the uranium elution process. The development of non-acidic elution strategies offers a feasible method to alleviate the chemical damage to the trunk materials.

      <span>In addition to the well-established adsorption approaches relying on the surface-based physicochemical adsorption nature of various adsorbents, recently, novel strategies such as electrochemical and photochemical approaches have been exploited in emerging UES systems (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a>). With the aid of an extra electric field or light energy, the adsorption–desorption equilibria controlled by the thermodynamics will be broken, and the mass transfer diffusion of uranium will be promoted. Consequently, these electrically-driven or light-driven systems have demonstrated higher capacity and faster kinetics in uranium extraction, compared with the current passive adsorption approach. These appealing methods open up new perspectives for uranium extraction and may lead to a more efficient yet economically viable process.

        <span>An impressive study by Cui and co-workers to manipulate an external electric field for promoting UES was reported in 2017.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276,277</span></sup></a> A marvellous uranium extraction capacity of 1932 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was achieved by a half-wave rectified alternating current electrochemical (HW-ACE) method. The HW-ACE method is interpreted in five steps (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig32">Fig. 32</a>) with a voltage alternating between −5 V and 0 V. In step I, all the ions are randomly dispersed in the aqueous solution. In step II, with the negative voltage, the ions start migrating because of the external electric field and generate an electric double layer on the surface of the AO electrode. In step III, the uranyl ions which are bound by the AO groups can be reduced and deposited on the surface of the electrode. In step IV, when the external electric field is removed, the ions which are neither chelated by the AO group nor electrodeposited are redispersed in the solvent. Step V is the cycle repeat; further uranyl ions are attached to the electrode and deposited as UO<small><sub>2</sub></small> particles. Furthermore, the authors tested the HW-ACE method in 4 L filtered, unspiked seawater, and the uptake of the uranium was 1.62 μg, while the physicochemical adsorption methods extracted 0.56 μg uranium. Cui's work shows that deploying classical uranium extraction adsorbents in an electrochemical system can break the complexation balance by converting U(<span class="small_caps">VI</span>) to U(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) and achieve high-efficiency UES.</span>

However, there are still two intrinsic limitations restricting the electrochemical extraction of uranium. First, the concentrations of various coexisting cations are several orders of magnitude higher than that of uranyl ions in oceans, which would considerably affect the uranium separation efficiency by electrochemical strategies. Second, the electric double layer (EDL) thickness or Debye length (ID) of the confined external electric field of the charged medium is less than 1 nm, and that is negligible to work for the enrichment of uranyl ions in the micrometer-sized adsorbent particles. The Zhu team designed and synthesized a novel core–shell structure PAF (PPA@MISS-PAF-1), in which the conductive chains of polyphenylacetylene (PPA) were incorporated into the porous channels of the PAF to serve as the pathways for ion transportation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> Under the asymmetrical alternating current electrochemical (AACE) method, the charged PPA chains provided an expanded electric field to guide the migration of metal ions.

        <p class="otherpara">In addition to electrochemical reduction deposition, a recent study by the Li group attempted to deposit uranium in aqueous solutions by an electrolytic strategy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit289"><sup><span class="sup_ref">289</span></sup></a> The authors synthesized a functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D-FrGOF) electrode by a hydrothermal process.

        <p class="otherpara">The potential of electrochemical strategies in the practical application of UES is being continuously explored. In general, the marriage between electrochemical approaches and UES offers notable advantages related to both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the chemical separation process. First, assisted by an external electric field, the extraction efficiency of UES is increased because of the accelerated diffusional mass transfer of uranyl ions towards the functional ligands. Second, through the electrochemical reduction process, the uranyl ions bound to the functional ligands are converted to neutral precipitation (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, UO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>O(UO<small><sub>3</sub></small>·H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O)<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>). This breaks the conventional adsorption–desorption equilibrium and makes it shift towards the generation of more uranium products. Third, unlike the traditional adsorption method, the uranium products obtained by the abovementioned electrochemical approaches are in the solid form which is convenient for recovery. This eliminates the tedious elution process and reduces the cost.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">To further demonstrate the feasibility of the electrochemical approaches for UES, major problems that need to be solved include the following aspects. (1) Most of the above studies were carried out in an acidic system (pH = 4.0–5.0). The dominant species of uranium in aqueous systems in the pH range is UO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>2+</sup></small> with a positively charged state.

Whether excellent adsorption performances can be maintained is a question that needs to be investigated. (2) Since the electrochemical methods need an external electric field, the deployment of such separation systems in the ocean requires more consideration at the engineering design level (such as the method safety, and the construction cost and operating cost). (3) Due to the extremely low concentration of uranium in seawater, the electrochemical devices need to be immersed in seawater for quite a long time to obtain recoverable uranium products. The corrosion of the electrochemical devices by the high concentration of salts and a wide variety of microorganisms in the ocean thus needs to be evaluated and addressed.</p>

A specific challenge that should not be ignored is the use of sacrificial agents, such as methanol and ethanol, in photocatalytic systems. Although sacrificial agents play an important role in facilitating the reduction of uranium on semiconductors with lower reduction potentials, it seems impractical to use these sacrificial agents in real seawater systems. A more environmentally friendly and effective UES process would be established if the issue of sacrificial agents is addressed.

Information from marine field studies is valuable for evaluating the adsorption capacity, selectivity, biofouling resistance and durability of the adsorbents under real seawater conditions.

        <span>Driven by the scarcity of domestic uranium resources and the sharp increase in uranium demand, Japan turned its attention to the ocean as early as the 1960s to exploit marine uranium reserves. Laboratory experiments were then carried out by the National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology (Shikoku), the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University and other research institutes. In 1974, the Research Committee on Rare Resources from Seawater organized by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) started the overall study on the recovery of uranium from seawater. In the subsequent year, the Metal Mining Agency of Japan participated in the project, and a coordinating committee was then established.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit309"><sup><span class="sup_ref">309</span></sup></a> These early extensive efforts focused on the screening of various adsorbents where hydrous titanium oxide (HTO) was identified as a promising adsorbent.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19–21,311</span></sup></a> The first experimental plant for UES was operated by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE), MITI and the Metal Mining Agency of Japan from 1981 to 1988, with HTO as the adsorbent. However, the reported adsorption capacity of the HTO was only 0.1 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which was clearly not economically feasible. Moreover, the requirement for mechanical pumping of seawater across the adsorbent bed and the poor mechanical resistance of the HTO limited its practical applications, leading to the cessation of the project.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a></span>

        <p class="otherpara">Significantly, the largest marine field test led by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) was carried out and a two-year-long effort from 1999 to 2001 was devoted to uranium recovery from the Pacific Ocean. In this project, two different uranium collection systems using adsorbents stacks<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit315"><sup><span class="sup_ref">315,319,320</span></sup></a> and braided adsorbents<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit318"><sup><span class="sup_ref">318,321</span></sup></a> were designed and prepared, respectively. The detailed design parameters of the two systems were provided by Tamada and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> As for the stack collection system (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig38">Fig. 38B</a>), the adsorption stacks were prepared from PE nonwoven fabrics grafted with AO ligands, which were then cut into smaller sheets and packed into cages that were lowered from a floating frame into the Pacific Ocean. The adsorption beds were hanged out every 20–40 d and the adsorbed uranium on the adsorbent fabric was fractionally eluted with 0.5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl. Over 240 d of contact with seawater, more than 1 kg yellowcake was yielded, affording an average adsorption ability of 0.5 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 30 d soaking. However, one major problem with the stack collection system was the high collection cost. Due to the large weight of the marine equipment for mooring the adsorbents in seawater, the mooring operations of the stack collection system were found to account for more than 70% of the total cost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit322"><sup><span class="sup_ref">322</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">To address this issue, an innovative system using braided adsorbents was designed in 2004, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig38">Fig. 38C</a>. These long kelp-like braids of AO-functionalized PE fibers could be anchored to the seafloor without a floating frame and adsorption beds, and could be cut off from the anchor using wireless operation when collected. Besides, the braid adsorbents that appeared on the sea surface could be recovered with a fishing boat. The braid system was evaluated in the sea of Okinawa area in Japan. Impressively, a breakthrough in UES was achieved in this work where a successful uptake of 1.5 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for uranium was acquired by the braided AO-based fibers after 30 d, which was three times higher than that of adsorbent stacks. Compared with the stack collection system, the higher adsorption capacity acquired by the braided-type adsorbents may be attributed to the enhanced contact between the adsorbents and seawater. Moreover, the braid collection system was estimated to achieve a reduction of 40% of the cost for UES compared to the stack collection system, since the construction of the floating frame and the adsorption beds could be avoided.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An extended economic analysis of the braid collection system was performed by Tamada and colleagues in 2006,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit323"><sup><span class="sup_ref">323</span></sup></a> with the consideration of the three basic steps in the uranium production process, including adsorbent production, uranium extraction, and elution and purification. A design for a large-scale UES system was proposed, with an annual output of 1200 tU, adsorption ability of 2 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 60 d soaking and 6 times repeated usage. As a result, the collection cost was estimated to be 90<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 yen per kg-U (about $1000 per kg-U, in 2011 dollars). Additionally, the critical cost driver was identified as adsorbent production in this analysis, which accounted for 69% of the total cost. Later, Schneider and Sachde conducted an updated cost estimation for UES through the braid collection system developed by JAEA,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit324"><sup><span class="sup_ref">324</span></sup></a> incorporating the uncertainties in chemical, commodity and capital equipment costs. Using the same reference conditions as JAEA for adsorption capacity and recycles (a 60 d loading of 2 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 6 recycles of use of adsorbent) as a base case, a production cost of $1230 per kg-U with a 95% confidence interval of ($1040 per kg-U, $1440 per kg-U) was estimated in this study. The difference in cost was mostly attributed to their consideration of an experimentally observed 5% degradation of adsorbent capacity per use cycle. Further sensitivity studies highlighted that the major cost drivers in the braid collection system were the adsorbent capacity and the number of recycles of the adsorbents.</p>

        <span>Although the United States had carried out preliminary research on UES in the 1960s, few experimental efforts have been made before 1980. After the 2005–2007 uranium price bubble, the researchers in the United States were motivated by the need for economically viable uranium sources beyond terrestrial ores. Renewed enthusiasm was thus aroused to speed up the development of UES. The “Fuel Resources Project” was launched with the objective of developing advanced adsorbents with an adsorption capacity at least double that of the best adsorbent pioneered by JAEA (1.5 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit325"><sup><span class="sup_ref">325</span></sup></a> A multidisciplinary team was assembled with scientists from the United States national laboratories including Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), universities, and research institutes to address this challenging problem in 2011.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit326"><sup><span class="sup_ref">326</span></sup></a> Multifaceted efforts have been made since then, with major contributions achieved such as the development of “HiCap” and “U-Grabber” polymer adsorbents which received the ‘R&amp;D 100’ award in 2012 and 2016,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a> respectively, the optimized “AI” and “AF” series adsorbents prepared by RIGP,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110,111</span></sup></a> and the application of the ATRP approach for synthesis of novel adsorbents.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75,76</span></sup></a> Herein, we provide an overview of the establishment of marine test activities for performance assessment done in the United States over the period 2012–2016.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit155">155,202,310,327</a> The marine test program was started at the Marine Science Laboratory (MSL) of PNNL in 2012, to determine the adsorption behaviours of the adsorbents produced by program participants towards uranium and other elements (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, V, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni and Cd) under natural seawater conditions. Specifically, three formulations of the ORNL AO-based polymeric adsorbents, 38H, AF1 and AI8, which exhibited high capacity in batch screening experiments with simulated seawater,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit310"><sup><span class="sup_ref">310</span></sup></a> were initially employed in field tests with natural seawater. These adsorbents were produced in a fibrous form (40–100 mg samples) or further prepared in large mass as a braided material (5–10 g samples). Instead of deploying the adsorbents directly in the ocean, two kinds of indoor exposure systems, a flow-through column system and a recirculating flume exposure system (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig39">Fig. 39</a>), were designed and utilized for performance assessment. Ambient seawater from Sequim Bay, WA, was used for seawater exposure studies; it was delivered to a “wet laboratory” through a seawater delivery system developed in the MSL. Briefly, for the flow-through column system, the conditioned fibrous adsorbents were dispersed and packed in adsorption columns, and held in place using a combination of glass wool and/or glass beads (3–5 mm). For the flume exposure system, the conditioned braided adsorbent materials were mounted in the flume for seawater exposure. In both seawater exposure systems, the filtered natural seawater was pumped from a large-volume reservoir tank and constantly fed into the columns or flume under controlled temperature and flow-rate conditions, and then recycled back to the tanks. Additional details about the design parameters and concepts for both systems were given by Gill and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a></span>

        <p class="otherpara">Other formulations of adsorbents produced by either RIGP or ATRP approaches were also explored. Significantly, the ATRP-adsorbent (referred to as SB12-8) grafted with AN and HEA using PVC-<span class="italic">co</span>-CPVC fibers as the backbone achieved the highest <span class="italic">q</span><small><sub>U</sub></small> of 6.56 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 56 d of exposure to natural seawater, nearly a doubling in adsorption capacity over that of the 38H adsorbent. Subsequently, scale-up tests using a recirculating flume were carried out with braided adsorbents under controlled temperature and flow-rate conditions. Multiple cycles of exposure were first conducted with AF1 braided adsorbents, with the final adsorption capacity determined to be 4.03 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 56 d, which was comparable with the data obtained in the flow-through column test. The coincidence of the test results obtained in the two exposure systems validated the performance of the adsorbents. The production of the adsorbents was highly reproducible, and the test procedures were reliable. It is worth mentioning that there has been a continuous improvement in the adsorption capacity of AO-based polymeric adsorbents from 3.30 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to 6.56 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in 56 d in the marine tests conducted at PNNL.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Building on this work, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the University of Miami's Broad Key Island (BKI) Research Facility also served as coastal marine sites for additional marine tests using an identical exposure set-up as used at PNNL, to assess the effects of different oceanographic conditions and water quality conditions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, temperature, salinity, the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and competing ions) on uranium recovery from seawater. The time series measurements of the ONRL AF1 adsorbents were investigated at the WHOI using both flow-through column and flume exposure systems. The obtained adsorption capacity in the WHOI experiments was 15% and 55% higher than that observed in the PNNL experiments for column and flume tests, respectively. The regional differences in U adsorption capacity were attributed to the variations in competing ions and/or water quality parameters such as DOC concentrations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition, several formulations of AO-based polymeric adsorbents (AF1, AI8, AF8, and AF1-AO-DMSO) were selected and identical exposure systems were employed for investigations at BKI. The marine tests at BKI provided opportunities to assess the performances of these adsorbents under warmer ambient and higher saline conditions than those existing at Sequim Bay off the Washington coast. Following contact with seawater for a period of 56 d at ambient temperature (26–31 °C) and salinity (35.7 to 37.4), the AF1, AI8 and AF1-AO-DMSO adsorbents all exhibited similar uranium adsorption capacities (6.0 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to 6.6 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) in flume system tests, while the AF8 adsorbent showed a lower uptake of 4.4 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Obviously, all adsorbents tested at BKI exhibited higher capacities than those obtained at PNNL, which was mainly ascribed to the higher temperatures. These results acquired from different coastal marine environments highlighted the critical role of temperature, the competing ions and other water quality conditions such as DOC in the process of UES.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit330"><sup><span class="sup_ref">330</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">To save energy and costs associated with the deployment, mooring and recovery of adsorbents, a mechanically driven seawater extraction system called the symbiotic system was designed by Picard and co-workers in 2014.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit331"><sup><span class="sup_ref">331</span></sup></a> As illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig40">Fig. 40A</a>, the initial proposed concept of the symbiotic system consists of a continuous belt of adsorbents 4000 m in length, and a platform at the base of the wind tower supports the belt of adsorbent that loops in and out of the water. This belt cycles through the seawater beneath the turbine and through an elution plant located on a platform above the sea surface, thereby allowing for an autonomous elution procedure that can be precisely timed depending on the type of adsorbent used. The proposed system was sized to collect 1.2 tons of uranium per year, which was enough for supplying 5 MW nuclear power. An independent cost-analysis of such a symbiotic system was performed by Byers <span class="italic">et al.</span>, and the results were compared to a reference kelp-like deployment strategy. It was found that the symbiotic system could reduce the production cost by at least 11% from $450–890 per kg-U (in 2015 dollars) for the reference kelp-like scheme to $400–850 per kg-U,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit332"><sup><span class="sup_ref">332</span></sup></a> and up to 30% with further design optimization.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit333"><sup><span class="sup_ref">333</span></sup></a> The cost reduction was achieved by eliminating the offshore deployment and mooring cost through the symbiotic system, while it also increased the energy output of the wind farm. However, a limitation of the symbiotic system is that it typically requires the adsorbents to be braided into a belt held in tension, which may face difficulties in a marine environment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit334"><sup><span class="sup_ref">334</span></sup></a></p>

        <p class="otherpara">Taking that into account, a two-part system called the Symbiotic Machine for Ocean uRanium Extraction (SMORE) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig40">Fig. 40B and C</a>) was proposed by Haji and colleagues,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit335"><sup><span class="sup_ref">335–340</span></sup></a> to decouple the mechanical and chemical requirements of adsorbents for uranium harvesting from seawater. The SMORE concept involved the structure of an offshore floating wind turbine that was utilized to provide the mooring and structural support for an autonomous, offshore uranium-harvesting platform. Especially, the adsorbents were enclosed in a hard permeable outer shell with sufficient mechanical strength and durability for use in offshore environments and chemical resilience against elution treatments (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig40">Fig. 40D</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit336"><sup><span class="sup_ref">336</span></sup></a> In this design, the holes of the shell enclosures allowed the adsorbents to remain exposed to adequate seawater, but at the same time, the adsorbents were also mechanically protected with the spherical enclosures, thus meeting the durability requirements for UES. The shell enclosures were incrementally spaced along high-strength mooring ropes, resembling conventional ball-chain belts. These ball-chains were then strung together to create a net using cross-members which add rigidity and reduce the likelihood of tangling of individual lengths. Accordingly, this design was developed into two versions of prototypes at a 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>10 physical scale, one in which the adsorbent ball-chain net was continuously moving through the water and the other was only subjected to the ocean currents at the test site, known as a dynamic and stationary system, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig40">Fig. 40E and F</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit337"><sup><span class="sup_ref">337</span></sup></a> For both of the prototypes, four lengths of shells were combined to make a single net.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">These prototypes were successfully tested in the Massachusetts Maritime Academy (MMA) in Buzzards Bay, MA, in a nine-week ocean trial, with the ORNL AI8 adsorbent fibers as the reference adsorbent.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit340"><sup><span class="sup_ref">340</span></sup></a> Besides, two shell enclosures using slotted holes and circular holes were tested in this ocean trial (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig40">Fig. 40G</a>). At the end of a 56 d ocean test, a very little difference in uranium uptake by AI8 adsorbent fibers between the different enclosure or system types was observed, indicating that the system movement and shell designs did not increase the adsorption amount for uranium. The maximum <span class="italic">q</span><small><sub>U</sub></small> of approximately 1.25 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> by the AI8 adsorbent was achieved using the stationary system and the shell enclosure with slotted holes. This value was much lower than the capacities obtained for AI8 adsorbents in previous ocean tests (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>), which were partly attributed to the lower average ambient seawater temperature at MMA (5.8 to 17 °C), compared to other marine testing locations (26 to 31 °C). Temperature has been proven to exert a significant impact on uranium uptake, and there is a positive correlation between seawater temperature and uranium adsorption.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit341"><sup><span class="sup_ref">341</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition, the results also demonstrated that the movement of the shells through the water could reduce biofouling if above a certain threshold speed, which provided new ideas for integrating design elements such as bristle brushes and UV lamps to mitigate biofouling in such a uranium harvester. Additionally, the cost analysis of a continuous version of SMORE was carried out, where the uranium production cost using a SMORE deployment strategy was estimated to range from $313 to 593 per kg-U.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit342"><sup><span class="sup_ref">342</span></sup></a> Compared to the results of the original kelp-field design by JAEA ($430–870 per kg-U), in the best-case scenario using a SMORE system (the cost was estimated to be $313 per kg-U) could achieve a uranium cost reduction by 27%.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit333"><sup><span class="sup_ref">333</span></sup></a> The lower recovery cost was partially attributed to the higher number of optimized uses for the SMORE system. Besides, the dramatic decrease (over 43% reduction compared to the kelp-like scheme) in mooring and deployment costs of the SMORE deployment strategy also contributed to reducing the overall uranium production cost. In a nutshell, the symbiotic design of coupling a seawater uranium harvester with an existing offshore wind turbine allows for denser energy recovery per unit ecosystem, as well as lowering the overall uranium production cost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit333"><sup><span class="sup_ref">333</span></sup></a> Although the full-scale uranium harvesting system of the symbiotic design is only conceptually proposed and has not been verified in practice, it provides ideas for the future development of sustainable UES systems with less capital and operating costs.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect2653"><span class="b_heading">5.3. Marine tests in China</span></h3>
        <span>According to declassified documents, China launched studies on UES as early as the 1960s. In early 1965, a research group was established by East China Normal University to officially carry out studies on UES. In 1967, scientists from several institutes and universities in Shanghai (including East China University of Science and Technology, Institute of Applied Physics, CAS, and Shanghai University) joined the group, and “Team 671” was then established,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit343"><sup><span class="sup_ref">343</span></sup></a> aiming to explore approaches for the large-scale filed test of UES. In 1970, significant progress was made in China where 30 g of yellowcake was successfully recovered from seawater by “Team 671”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit344"><sup><span class="sup_ref">344</span></sup></a> It might be the first time that such a considerable amount of uranium was recovered from seawater. From then on, more scientific institutions for research in oceanic sciences or environmental protection in China have joined the project, and several test facilities were set up at different locations. Active programs on UES were conducted in the late 1970s to early 1980s, focusing on testing the performances of adsorbents (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, hydrous titanium oxide, basic zine carbonate, aluminium hydroxide and organic resins) and understanding their adsorption kinetics and mechanisms.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit309"><sup><span class="sup_ref">309,345</span></sup></a> However, in the late 1980s, due to the breakthroughs in land-based uranium mining technology, the urgent demand for uranium was alleviated, resulting in the suspension of research studies on UES in China.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A renewed interest in UES has been sparked by the surge in uranium price starting in 2005 and peaking in mid-2007. Under such circumstances, the plan for developing UES was restarted in China in 2011. Since then, interest in UES has been continuously increased by supporting fundamental research on the design and creation of adsorbents, developing advanced characterization techniques, and establishing computational models. Significantly, engineering tests for UES have been initiated. Several offshore systems have been successfully constructed in China for marine field tests. Considerable advancements have been made, especially in recent years, by locating adaptable materials and building infrastructures for scale-up marine tests. In 2019, an innovation alliance for UES initiated by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has been founded, bringing together more than 20 universities and institutes to promote the development of UES. In what follows, we provide the first comprehensive review of the progress made by the institutions in China in the implementation of marine tests.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In 2011, CAEP pioneered marine field tests in China to verify uranium extraction from real seawater. The AO-functionalized non-woven fabric materials of 10 kg were prepared by a pre-irradiation amplification method, packed into a special mesh stainless steel container, and deployed in the South China Sea using a floating mooring system for the first marine test.

        <p class="otherpara">In order to perform large-scale uranium extraction tests in real seawater, the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute (SARI) of CAS successfully developed a nanofiber-based membrane with high adsorption capacity, a fast uranium adsorption rate, and good selectivity based on electrospinning technology. In the past 10 years, batch preparation from laboratory membranes to industrial membrane modules has been completed. In 2018, a small-scale marine test for uranium extraction in the East China Sea was carried out with kilogram-scale membranes, affording a recovery of nearly 20 g of yellowcake after 30 d in seawater.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit343"><sup><span class="sup_ref">343</span></sup></a> In the next year, an adsorption platform and a matched elution platform for UES were established in the South China Sea by SARI, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig41">Fig. 41</a>. The adsorption performances of the nanofiber-based membrane at the platform are currently being tested.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Since the low concentration of uranium in seawater is a huge obstacle for UES, the concept of uranium extraction from brine which has a significantly higher uranium concentration was born. A ready supply of more concentrated saline solution would potentially allow for greater uranium recovery using the currently available adsorbents.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit346"><sup><span class="sup_ref">346–348</span></sup></a> Accordingly, the Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Engineering and Metallurgy (BRICEM) has developed several uranium extraction polymers with high antimicrobial activity. In 2019, a field test was carried out in Dagze Co Salt Lake, Tibet, for uranium recovery. More than 300 g of yellowcake was recovered, with an average adsorption ability of 7.1 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. In addition, the performances of the polymers for uranium recovery from seawater were also evaluated. Recently, polymers were anchored and deployed in the South China Sea near Changjiang, Hainan (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig41">Fig. 41</a>). Over a three-month marine test, a <span class="italic">q</span><small><sub>U</sub></small> of 4.1 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit343"><sup><span class="sup_ref">343</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP) of CAS also conducted marine experiments to test the performances of the AO-based fibers they developed in real seawater. In 2015, the performances of AO-UHMWPE fibers that were prepared by pre-irradiation-induced graft copolymerization of AN and AA on UHMWPE fibers, followed by amidoximation,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69,71,72</span></sup></a> were initially explored. UHMWPE was selected as a substrate polymer to overcome the poor mechanical properties demonstrated by conventional matrix polymers after irradiation. The test site was located at the East China Sea, which was about 100 m from the Chinese coast.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit71"><sup><span class="sup_ref">71</span></sup></a> The fibers were freely placed in a sea stream ∼3 m below the sea surface by a combination of floating buoys and an anchor. After 60 d, a moderate uptake of 0.25 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was observed, whereas a higher adsorption amount of 0.48 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained when the fibers were sent to the MSL, PNNL in Sequim, WA, for the test. The lower adsorption in the East China Sea was ascribed to the coexistence of competitive ions and marine biofouling.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In a follow-up study, several AO-UHMWPE fibers were synthesized by varying preparation conditions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, irradiation dose, AN<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>AA ratio, grafting temperature and amidoximation conditions), resulting in adsorbents with different AO densities.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> These fibers were subsequently tested at three different adsorption platforms developed in Xiamen, Daishan and Raoping, respectively, to examine their adsorption performances. When tested in the Xiamen and Daishan adsorption platforms, the adsorbents were strapped and directly immersed in seawater, about 3 m or 1 m below the water surface, respectively. On the other hand, during the tests at the Raoping adsorption platform, seawater was pumped into an underground impounding reservoir where adsorbents were immersed. In such a manner, the seawater in the reservoir was almost static with a very low flow velocity of less than 0.01 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. As indicated in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>, the uranium adsorption capacities obtained from the marine adsorption test varied with the adsorbent, adsorption platform and adsorption time, affording 0.04–1.41 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of the seven fiber samples (AO-UHMWPE-1-7). These results suggested that in addition to the characteristics of the adsorbents, marine hydrological conditions, such as temperature, ion concentrations, water quality and biofouling, are all important for uranium extraction in real marine experiments. Regarding uranium uptake performance in this test, the AO-UHMWPE-7 adsorbent acquired a maximum capacity of 1.41 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after 15 d in the Daishan adsorption platform, which may be attributed to the high AO density of AO-UHMWPE-7 and the appropriate marine hydrological conditions of the Daishan adsorption platform.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Scientists from Hainan University have devoted their efforts towards the research on UES for developing novel adsorbent materials that can extract uranium from seawater with good performances. In recent years, multiple novel nanomaterial adsorbents have been synthesized and evaluated for uranium recovery in laboratory studies. Meanwhile, a flow-through column system with parallel multi-channels was designed and used for natural seawater exposure studies by Hainan University (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig43">Fig. 43</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124–126</span></sup></a> Similar to the design of the flow-through column system developed in PNNL, the natural seawater was collected and stored in a 5-T volume water tank, and was filtered through a microfiltration membrane (0.22 μm) system before being used for adsorption. The filtered natural seawater was stored in a 1-T tank and constantly fed into the columns at controlled speed, which were packed with the conditioned adsorbents. The filtered natural seawater was circulated in 12 parallel adsorption columns for each phase of test, and was regularly refreshed with new filtered natural seawater. The field column experiments of various kinds of adsorbents (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, fibers, membranes and hydrogels) developed by Hainan University were performed at the State Key Laboratory of Marine Resource Utilization in the South China Sea, Hainan, and the results are compiled in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>.

        <p class="otherpara">As described above, substantial efforts have been devoted by different countries for conducting marine experiments at selected locations. The information obtained from these studies is extremely valuable in evaluating the practical performances of adsorbents and verifying the technical feasibility of UES. The well-developed AO-functionalized polymeric adsorbents have demonstrated their potential in marine tests due to the high binding affinity to uranium and the chemical stability in ocean environments. Continuous progress has been made to improve the uranium adsorption capacity for AO-based polymeric adsorbents during marine tests. However, there is still a huge gap between the data obtained in marine tests and those in laboratories, suggesting the matrix complexity of the real seawater. Since uranium adsorption is highly dependent on the environmental conditions of the ocean, the fundamental understanding of the effect of environmental parameters (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, temperature and flow rate of seawater) on the extraction process is of vital importance for the scalability of UES. On the other hand, regarding the deployment of adsorbents, several systems such as floating platforms or stacks, flow-through or recirculating flume exposure systems, tethered braids and SMORE systems have been established. Meanwhile, various contact manners between adsorbents and seawater including mooring, soaking, pumping and towing have been evaluated with different adsorption bed configurations. From a practical point of view, further systematic studies on scaling up these technologies and evaluating their performances under realistic operation conditions are required.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition, the cost is another major obstacle facing the existing technology for UES. As mentioned above, several studies have conducted the cost–efficiency analysis based on the established systems or conceptual protocols for UES.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">144,323,324,327,332,342,349</span></sup></a> Representative passive, current-driven systems and mechanically driven symbiotic systems were evaluated, highlighting three major components in the cost of uranium recovery from the oceans (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, adsorbent production, mooring and deployment, and elution and regeneration). It is generally concluded from these examinations that adsorbent production is the major cost in the process of UES. Therefore, minimizing the cost of adsorbent production is regarded as a key objective for UES. Efforts have been also devoted to improving the adsorption capacity and number of recycles of the adsorbents, which are identified as two pathways that could reduce the cost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit327"><sup><span class="sup_ref">327</span></sup></a> Clearly, dramatically improving the adsorption capacity, which would perhaps allow a single use of the adsorbents, could significantly reduce the cost of UES.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84,133</span></sup></a> On the other hand, the adsorbents that can be effectively reused for multiple cycles without loss of adsorption capacity can also significantly reduce the overall cost of uranium production, but this simultaneously leads to increased mooring and collection cost, which is also a major cost driver for UES.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Currently, none of the established systems for UES can compete economically with terrestrial mining, and the estimated cost of uranium is still higher than the price of uranium from conventional sources. For improving a UES system to be economically viable, a priority in future work lies in continuously promoting the adsorption capacity of adsorbents. With the reduction in the cost of raw materials and the development of synthetic techniques, the production cost of adsorbents is expected to be gradually decreased. In the meantime, the mooring and deployment costs will become the greater contributor to the final cost. Linking the UES system to a local power source appears to be effective in reducing the cost by eliminating the offshore deployment and mooring cost.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">144,331</span></sup></a> Equally important, efforts should also be put into reducing the degradation arising due to elution, which will lower the overall production cost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152</span></sup></a> Since adsorbent regeneration is regarded as a necessity for economic viability, an effective, non-destructive elution/regeneration process to enable the maximum reuse of adsorbents is required. Overall, extensive R&amp;D is still needed before economically viable UES can be achieved.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect3021"><span class="a_heading">6. Current challenges and future perspectives</span></h2>
      <span>As hereinbefore described, the sustainable development of nuclear energy is crucial for the global low-carbon energy transition. Due to the dwindling availability of terrestrial uranium reserves, UES has been considered to be a potential approach for unconventional uranium harvesting to secure the expansion of nuclear energy. Starting from the “Project Oyster”, UES has attracted extensive academic and industrial attention over the past decades, evoking steady research and development efforts in multiple countries. In particular, the past five years have witnessed great progress in the field of UES. Salient improvements have been achieved in adsorption performances (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, adsorption capacity, selectivity, biofouling resistance, durability) by using various novel strategies for the function-oriented development of adsorbents. More mechanistic insights into uranyl–ligand interactions have been obtained, inspiring innovative design and preorganization of the ligands to promote the binding ability and selectivity to uranium. The improvement of polymerization methods for the preparation of polymeric materials endows adsorbents with a maximum number of binding sites. Meanwhile, based on a better understanding of the structure–property relationship of polymers from the molecular, mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, by tuning the physicochemical properties (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, ligand density, spatial conformation, surface area, pore size) of adsorbents, constantly increased adsorption capacities have been achieved. In addition, a deeper understanding of the effects of marine biofouling on uranium extraction has been obtained, and a variety of biofouling-proof adsorbents have been developed, which have demonstrated high inhibitory activity to marine bacteria. Especially, a noteworthy trend is the introduction of electrochemical and photochemical approaches to UES systems, which displayed faster kinetics and enhanced uranium extraction compared to conventional physicochemical adsorption. These appealing methods are believed to hold promise for developing new UES systems. Meanwhile, progress has also been realized in the engineering aspects of UES, evidenced by the implementation of scale-up marine tests, the building of offshore adsorption platforms, and the successful acquisition of yellowcake from the ocean. Overall, these multi-faceted efforts have propelled UES towards the industrialization goal of marine uranium recovery.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Although great progress has been made in the field of UES, there are still significant challenges and obstacles that hinder the commercialization of UES. To develop technically and economically viable UES systems, additional breakthroughs are required. Herein, we will discuss the current challenges and describe future research directions for UES in terms of fundamental, technical and engineering aspects, respectively.</p>
      
        <h3 id="sect3028"><span class="b_heading">(1) Fundamental aspects of uranium coordination chemistry and adsorption science</span></h3>
        <span>Uranium harvesting from seawater is essentially chemical separation associated with the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of uranyl ions on the interfaces between adsorbents and seawater. In principle, achieving efficient chemical separation depends on the simultaneous tuning of the thermodynamic and kinetic factors. First, the uranyl–ligand interaction plays a pivotal role which determines the thermodynamic basis of the uranium adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Developing adsorbents with a sufficient binding ability and selectivity to uranium in seawater fundamentally relies on the engineering of uranyl–ligand interactions at the molecular level. With that in mind, understanding the basic principles for uranium coordination will accelerate the design and screening of functional ligands. Recently, while AO moieties have been demonstrated to be a category of most effective ligands for UES, the underlying coordination chemistry between AO ligands and uranyl in the seawater, as well as the nature of the complexes, has not been completely understood. More mechanistic insights into the uranyl–AO binding interactions in ocean environments are required, which could serve as guidance for the design of alternative or next-generation ligands with an enhanced binding ability.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Learning from biological systems with a high affinity to uranium offers an intriguing way to screen favourable ligands. By identifying the specific sites of biomacromolecules, such as peptides, proteins and DNA, responsible for uranium enrichment, biological ligands with a superb binding ability to uranyl ions have been located. These state-of-the-art ligands efficiently coordinate with uranium by reaching a more thermodynamically stable state. Novel adsorbents functionalized with these biological ligands exhibit exceptional selectivity to uranyl ions in the seawater. However, there remain severe challenges for the practical use of these biocomponent-containing adsorbents in the complex ecological environment of the oceans. In the meantime, the research in this field inspired the idea to develop artificial uranyl nanotraps by tuning the preorganization and/or synergistic effect of the binding sites. These nascent concepts are encouraging, but more research concerning the geometry of uranyl coordination complexes is needed before the principles for regulating the spatial arrangements of the ligands while eliminating the steric hindrance could be established. Technically, more advanced spectroscopic analysis and the methods of computational chemistry would be supportive to this end.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Aside from the thermodynamic factors controlling the uranyl–ligand interactions, the kinetic aspects of the uranium adsorption equilibrium involving the mass transfer efficiency are of equal importance. A critical issue that must be highlighted is the effectiveness of the ligands or, in other words, their accessibility to the uranyl ions, which is significantly influenced by the chain conformation of polymeric adsorbents. Currently, established approaches to regulate the polymer chain conformation mainly rely on the introduction of hydrophilic copolymer chains through random or block copolymerization. However, most of these polymer architectures still cannot afford favourable conformations in high-salinity seawater due to the polyelectrolyte effect, resulting in an insufficient utilization of the ligands, and thus an inadequate adsorption capacity much lower than the theoretical value. More interactions to regulate the chain conformation of polymers, such as the electrostatic interaction, should be exploited to maximize the ligand availability by reducing the internal diffusion barriers of the uranyl ions. On the other hand, the relationship between the structure, chain conformation and adsorption behaviour of polymer adsorbents remains an area that is largely unexplored. In this regard, the vigorous development of computer technology, combined with constantly improved computational chemistry theories and simulation models, offers an avenue for the multi-scale investigation of the underlying scientific issues associated with uranium adsorption in aqueous solutions. Meanwhile, pivotal information about the structural and conformational properties of polymeric adsorbents could be experimentally obtained by using the neutron reflectometry (NR) method. These fundamental research studies would establish a more comprehensive understanding of the structure–property relationship, inspiring the design of high-performance polymeric adsorbents for UES.</p>

        <span>Based on the fundamental insights into uranyl–ligand interactions, chemists have employed miscellaneous synthetic methods to introduce the identified ligands (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, AO) to specific substrates for developing uranium adsorbents. A majority of previous research tended to emphasize a great number or a high density of carefully-designed ligands introduced into adsorbents. However, as described above, most of the reported adsorbents were limited by the poor utilization of the functional ligands. Thus, a primary technical challenge lies in how to preserve the effectiveness and accessibility of the functional ligands by using more controllable synthetic methods for preparing uranium adsorbents. Taking the well-developed polymeric adsorbents bearing AO ligands as an example, since the AO ligands are tethered to the polymer backbones, the role of local chemistry and steric factors need to be examined. On this basis, rational design and synthesis of polymeric adsorbents is required to create a favourable coordination environment to promote the effective formation of uranyl–ligand complex species. Additionally, for the bio-inspired binding motifs involving the preorganization and/or synergistic effect of ligands, more advanced synthesis is needed to tune the distribution and arrangement of the ligands for achieving collaborative binding. On the other hand, the accessibility of the ligands can be improved by regulating the polymer chain conformation to eliminate the mass transport barriers. But how to precisely control the chain structure and topology of polymers remains a technical challenge when synthesizing specific polymeric adsorbents. More efforts are needed to develop controlled polymerization techniques to achieve the precise synthesis of polymers with conformational benefits to address the kinetic obstacles for uranium adsorption.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The structural robustness of adsorbents is also a crucial point to consider. It has been demonstrated that increasing the number of recycles of adsorbents will significantly lower the overall cost of uranium production. However, the current fact is that the adsorption capacity of adsorbents degrades rapidly during cycle use. To enhance the durability of uranium adsorbents, the following issues should be considered. The first is the improvement of structural stability of adsorbents in the preparation process. Studies have shown that during the synthesis process of adsorbents, various steps including radiation graft polymerization, hydroxylamine treatment, and hot alkali treatment will cause certain damage to the mechanical strength of the adsorbents. In this way, hosts with high mechanical strength are preferred, and effective but mild synthesis methods are needed to reduce damage to the materials. Besides, the structural stability in seawater environments is also essential for any adsorbents since an unstable adsorbent suffers from structural degradation over prolonged seawater exposure. From this perspective, polymer adsorbents have more potential for practical application than most of the emerging porous framework adsorbents in realistic marine tests due to their excellent structural stability. The second issue is the durability of adsorbents in the elution process. The loss and deterioration of adsorbents in the elution process (especially using a strong acid leaching method) is a significant challenge that limits the reusability of the adsorbents. Improving the elution/regeneration process by using a non-acidic solution seems to be an effective method to avoid the deterioration of the adsorbent performance, and more eluents need to be examined in this respect. Besides, it should be noted that, for the various popular porous materials explored for uranium adsorption in recent years, an appropriate form for deployment in the seawater is the prerequisite for considering them as promising candidates for UES. So, there remains significant room to develop versatile synthetic and processing techniques for shaping these potential materials as deployable adsorbents.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Improving biofouling-resistant properties is another technical issue for developing adaptable adsorbents for UES. As described previously, the uranium adsorbents deployed in the ocean are inevitably subjected to biofouling. The attachment of marine microorganisms inhibits the contact between uranyl ions and the adsorbent surfaces, resulting in a significant reduction in uranium recovery. Additionally, biofouling also affects the reusability of the adsorbent due to the harsh treatments required to remove the foulants. In recent years, achievable strategies have been proposed to develop adsorbents with anti-biofouling properties, such as incorporating antibacterial components that can actively kill bacteria or introducing anti-adhesion coatings to prevent the attachment of marine organisms on the adsorbent surfaces. Several biofouling-proof adsorbents have been successfully developed, demonstrating effective biofouling resistance for specific bacteria. However, current antimicrobial evaluation experiments are basically carried out in laboratory tests. The complexity of biological species in real seawater and the fluidity of seawater bring more uncertainties and challenges to the practical antifouling performance of these adsorbents in the ocean. Future research on antimicrobial assessments should be carried out in the marine environment to verify the realistic performance of adsorbents.</p>
      
      
        <h3 id="sect3039"><span class="b_heading">(3) Engineering aspects for expanding marine field tests</span></h3>
        <span>The ultimate goal of UES is to realize scale-up marine engineering for stable and economically viable harvesting of uranium. Up to now, although several marine field tests have been implemented and multiple offshore platforms have been established, there are still many bottlenecks associated with marine engineering. Substantial efforts still are required to address the challenges. The first challenge comes from the complex ocean environment. Prior to marine engineering, an overall understanding of oceanographic conditions is of great importance, because there remain huge gaps between the data obtained in marine field tests and those obtained in simulated seawater. These gaps suggest that the performance of adsorbents developed in laboratories needs to be validated under real seawater conditions. Therefore, the solvation structures of dominant uranium species and the uranyl–ligand interactions need to be examined in natural seawater environments with specific pH values and high salinity. Meanwhile, the influence of the temperature and velocity of seawater should be evaluated to determine the optimal locations and conditions for marine field tests. Specifically, as discussed above, marine biofouling is a serious and inevitable issue related to the deployment of adsorbents in real seawater. The attachment of marine organisms to the adsorbent surfaces severely limits the uptake of uranium and the reusability of the adsorbents. In this sense, it is quite necessary to identify the dominant marine organisms affecting uranium harvesting. Antibiofouling adsorbents targeting specific biological species can thus be developed. Conversely, the deployment of UES adsorbents, especially for those with bactericidal activity, and facilities in seawater also affects local marine ecosystems. The research on these impacts would be necessary if scale-up marine field tests for UES are implemented.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Another major challenge is to develop an effective and economically competitive system for the deployment of adsorbents. In this regard, both actively pumped systems and passive, current-driven systems have been evaluated. The latter outperform due to their simplicity and lower cost. For instance, the braid collection system developed by Japan, with the braided adsorbents anchored to the seafloor, has been acknowledged as a promising deployment mode, enabling efficient contact between uranyl ions and adsorbents with the aid of wave or current forces. From an economic perspective, the passive extraction processes that avoid the energy consumption required for seawater pumping have advantages. However, the extremely low concentration of uranium in seawater leads to slow adsorption kinetics in the passive extraction processes, influencing the uranium extraction efficiency. In the meantime, the prolonged exposure of the adsorbents in seawater results in more serious biofouling, which could compromise the capacity and reusability of the adsorbents. These aspects are not evaluated in the previously reported cost–efficiency analysis.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The emerging electrochemical and photochemical approaches for uranium extraction seem to provide solutions to this problem. Compared to the passive extraction processes, the application of an extra electrical field or light energy to the adsorption system improves the adsorption rate and capacity, thereby achieving a more efficient uranium extraction. As no pilot operations of these strategies have been performed, and any power requirements are based on lab-scale assessments, the scale-up deployment of these scenarios and the corresponding cost assessments require further efforts. On the other hand, it is generally believed that linking the UES to coastal nuclear power stations, desalination plants, or offshore energy technologies such as wind and tidal power could substantially promote the extraction process and reduce the cost. As claimed by the CNNC, a project to integrate the UES components with the warm water discharge system of a coastal nuclear power station has been launched. While the existing techniques for UES are mostly in the R&amp;D stage, substantial efforts are still needed to demonstrate the feasibility and economic efficiency of the integrative systems.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Of particular note, standard protocols for validating the adsorption capacity or extraction efficiency of different UES systems, either in laboratory studies or in marine field tests, should be proposed. Many data sets reported in the current literature were obtained under experimental conditions of very little relevance to realistic marine environments in terms of uranium concentration, pH value, competing ions and microorganisms. A head-to-head comparison of potential candidates cannot be made when screening the most promising uranium adsorbents. Besides, general facilities or platforms, either coastal or offshore, to demonstrate the deployments of UES systems should be established, and open opportunities should be offered to researchers in universities or institutes to access these resources. Additionally, an area that has not been explored yet is the evaluation of the impact of coastal or offshore UES systems, in terms of both infrastructures and adsorbent components, on marine ecological systems. The results would be valuable for the governments to make policies for scale-up marine tests of UES, thereby preventing negative impacts on the marine ecological systems. Before the commercialization of UES, the corresponding regulations or even laws should be established to protect the marine environment and maintain the ecological balance.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Ultimately, the commercialization of UES depends on its economic viability. While several cost estimations have been made for some of the currently reported adsorbents and extraction systems, most of them are based on assumptions regarding adsorption capacity, recycle numbers and equipment requirements. However, an accurate economic assessment system should rest on the practical marine field tests of UES, with real and repeatable measured data as a reference, so as to comprehensively assess the contribution of each factor (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, adsorbent production, mooring and deployment, elution and regeneration, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) in the final uranium production cost. To this end, a reliable economic assessment system for the marine engineering of UES should be established.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In sum, future research on UES should focus on addressing the above challenges involving fundamental, technical and engineering issues. It is highly believed by the authors that a more comprehensive understanding of the coordination chemistry of uranium is of fundamental significance. This would inspire the exploration of new effective binding motifs by regulating the uranyl–ligand interactions at the molecular level. Meanwhile, the thermodynamic and kinetic factors influencing the uranium adsorption equilibrium should be simultaneously tuned to achieve an efficient uranium extraction. Particular attention should be given to the kinetic aspects involving the accessibility of the binding sites and the mass transfer efficiency of uranyl ions. Technically, advanced synthesis and polymerization methods are required for the controlled preparation of uranium adsorbents, allowing the tuning of the arrangement of binding sites while promoting their accessibility. Innovative ideas are encouraged to explore bio-inspired U-specific ligands for improving the selectivity of adsorbents, as well as emerging electrochemical and photochemical approaches for increasing the uranium extraction efficiency. Besides, from an engineering perspective, additional efforts should be made to develop infrastructures for marine field tests while optimizing individual or integrated UES systems. On this basis, a comprehensive cost–efficiency analysis of UES could be made, and eventually, a realistic roadmap for the commercialization of UES could be established.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Conclusively, UES is one of the remarkable activities for human beings to exploit strategic resources from the ocean. We provided here a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in the UES field and the efforts that are needed to make it technically and economically viable. Such an interdisciplinary field requires close cooperation between scientists and industrial engineers in different disciplines. Despite the critical challenges, encouraging achievements have been made in the past five years. New opportunities have been opened up for the development of more competitive UES technologies for commercial applications in the future. More significantly, elaborating the fundamental, technical and engineering issues of UES would provide concrete guidance for more general research on metal resource extraction from dilute media, such as lithium extraction from oceans or salt lakes.</p>
