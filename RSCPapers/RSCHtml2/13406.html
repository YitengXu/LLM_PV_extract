Laser induced break down spectrometry (LIBS), in particular, continues to be of interest. For example, LIBS was the focus of 20 out of 29 atomic emission spectrometry abstracts, for ferrous metals, during this review period. Although the abstracts noted in this review are applied, there were a number of fundamental LIBS papers published in the same time period. The reader is directed to the ASU Reviews on the various atomic spectrometric techniques.</span><h3 id="sect332"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Ferrous metals and alloys</span></h3><span>Noll and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> reviewed the performance of a LIBS-based inspection system for parts made from high alloy steel over a five year period. In this time, more than 1.5 million products have been successfully inspected. Using 100 laser pulses over a measurement time of 2 s (30 laser pulses to ablate surface contamination and 70 laser pulses for which spectra were collected), the authors were able to determine the signals of 12 elemental lines. This enabled distinction between 30 different high alloy steel grades. In general, the intensity of an iron line from a pure iron sample degraded with time due to degradation of laser components. The authors recommend future industrial LIBS have the means to: (1) monitor the laser energy close to the interaction region, (2) automate sample positioning, and (3) measure reference samples at set intervals to monitor the intensities of different line emissions.</span><p class="otherpara">Lopez-Moreno and colleagues discussed the measurement of samples at high temperature by LIBS in two papers. One paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> discussed calibration at low temperature while measuring steel slag samples at temperatures up to 850 °C. Correlation coefficients of 0.991 and 0.989 were reported for Si/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios, respectively. LIBS results correlated well with results obtained by XRF. The second paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> discussed determination of Cr, Mn and Ni in stainless steel at 1000 °C using a LIBS system that was a distance away from the high temperature environment. In both papers, calibration was achieved at room temperature and adapted using a linear transformation to measure samples at high temperatures.</p><p class="otherpara">There were two reports of miniaturized LIBS employing microchip lasers and miniature spectrometers. One device, which was constructed using commercial components, had a Limit of Detection (LOD) of 400 ppm for a C/Fe ratio and a precision of 4.3% RSD for C/Fe ratios of 0.001 to 0.01.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> These values were larger than conventional systems because of the use of an ungated detector and the spatial variability of the emission plume. A similar device developed by Lopez-Moreno <span class="italic">et al.</span> achieved 0.98–0.99 linear regression coefficients for the calibration curves of Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni and Si in low-alloy steel.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> The LOD was below 100 ppm, in most cases. The instrument utilized a Powerchip laser and a non-intensified, non-gated detector; and offered good beam quality and high repetition rate whilst causing minimal sample damage.</p><p class="otherpara">High speed scanning LIBS at a repetition rate of 1000 Hz and with a spatial resolution of &lt;20 μm was reported by Bette <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> No elaborate sample preparation was needed with only a simple surface grinding being found to be sufficient. Surface areas of 110 mm × 45 mm of the steel samples could be analyzed for C, N, O, P and S (as non-metallic inclusions). The authors concluded that this LIBS method could be used as a complementary technique to scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDXRF electron probe micro-analysis and capillary-RF for such analyses. A related paper by Kuss and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> investigated the statistical algorithms needed to distinguish between emission peaks from non-metallic inclusions and low intensity peaks arising from the same elements dissolved in the metal matrix.</p><p class="otherpara">On-line coating thickness measurements by a LIBS system were reported for Zn on galvanized sheet steel.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> The thickness resolution was estimated to be 400 nm and the method had a range of 3.2 to 11.2 μm. Methods for the determination of coating composition and coating thickness were discussed. Depth-profiling was achieved by adjusting the laser shot energy and interrogating a different position on the sheet for each data point. The technique proved successful, but a query must be made over its usefulness for a non-uniformly coated sample. A LIBS technique was also used by Caneve and co-workers as a diagnostic tool for thin films in the range of 200–550 nm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a></p><p class="otherpara">A review of <span class="italic">arc/spark optical emission spectrometry</span> (arc/spark OES) was written by Zhou <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> The review contained 95 references and dealt with principles and instrumentation as well as emphasising new applications. In another paper, a modified spark induced optical emission spectrometer was used to determine inclusions in steel samples taken during ladle treatment in an ASEA-SKF ladle furnace.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> The results agreed with the determinations from conventional analysis and were obtained in less time.</p><p class="otherpara">Chandrasekaran and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> studied the wear interactions between stainless steel and cemented carbide tools using laser ablation ICP-time of flight mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-ToF-MS). They reported that using this instrumentation, it was possible to identify inclusion products from work material at the tool-chip contact. It was concluded that LA-ICP-ToF-MS gave new possibilities to study wear layers associated with friction pairs and metal cutting operations.</p><p class="otherpara">Minor elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Sn) in flue dust from steelmaking were determined by LA-ICP-MS from pressed pellets as described by Coedo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> The pellets were made with a binder of cellulose and paraffin with Rh added as an internal standard. Calibration standards were made with a synthetic matrix of equal parts ZnO and Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>. Results were in agreement with the element values for flue dust reference materials. Another report from the same group<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> used LA-ICP-MS for depth profile analysis of Cu on steel. The best results were obtained with moderate laser energy (2 mJ per pulse) and by focusing the laser approximately 2000 μm below the surface. The ablation rate was estimated to be about 1 μm per pulse. Their method was validated by the analysis of samples with certified Cu coating thickness.</p><p class="otherpara">A new LA system consisting of a high frequency Q-switched laser and 2 scanning mirrors was used to analyze iron samples by LA-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> It was claimed that repetitive laser scanning of the sample area at 0.6 W power, removed the effect of element fractionation and gave a signal intensity and stability comparable with that generated by aspiration of a 500 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> solution of steel solution. Detection limits of 10 ppb for most elements were reported.</p><p class="otherpara">Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) has been used by several research groups to estimate the age of iron artefacts by carbon-14 dating. In one paper, Fujio<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> examined Japanese ironware to study the history of the iron in the Japanese Islands. In another paper, Scharf <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> stated one of the problems associated with such measurement as being the small concentration of C in iron which requires an unfeasibly large sample to be analyzed. They then discussed two approaches to radiocarbon dating used at the Erlangen AMS-facility. One method utilized the direct sputtering of the iron artefact in the ion source and the other involved the complete extraction of carbon from the iron sample then dating the carbonaceous residue.</p><p class="otherpara">Although there have not been any published reports, vendors have indicated that <span class="italic">hand-held X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer</span> sales have picked up considerably over the past couple of years. Hand held XRF instruments have been very useful in metal and alloy identification for operators with minimal training. A report by Ida and Kawai<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> concluded that using a hand-held XRF spectrometer, the composition of steel and brass samples, encased in packaging material, can be estimated (with better than 30% error) by ratioing the analyte intensity at the fluorescent lines to the Compton scattering of the incident X-rays. The fluorescence intensity of each element decreased with the thickness of the shielding or packaging and the thickness could be calculated from the intensity ratio Fe K<small><sub>β</sub></small>/Fe K<small><sub>α</sub></small> or by using the intensity of the Compton scattering of the incident X-rays. Han and co-workers used a fundamental parameter method with wavelength dispersive XRF (WD-XRF) to give relatively accurate results for the analysis of low-alloy steel and other types of reference materials using only a few type standards and pure element standards for calibration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The fundamental parameter method successfully corrected for any matrix effects and therefore enabled a relatively accurate analysis to be performed even when the calibrants were not matrix matched with the sample.</p><p class="otherpara">An overview article by McPhail<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> reviewed the applications of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) in material sciences. A wide variety of SIMS experiments were discussed in relation to many types of materials including stainless steel, museum artefacts and aerospace alloys. The distribution of B, boron nitride and O in steel doped with B and/or N was measured using SIMS after heat treatments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> Differences were observed for B intensity where B doping alone was done in contrast to where both B and N were doped into the steel. Krecar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> used two- and three-dimensional SIMS to investigate the distribution of P (a sintering activator) in sintered steels. Impact energy and hardness of steels with different concentrations of P were also measured to understand the influence of P on the mechanical properties of sintered steels. Oswald and co-workers determined O in Nd–Fe–B alloys by SIMS with calibration against oxygen-implanted single crystals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> SIMS measurements proved that the O in the Nd<small><sub>2</sub></small>Fe<small><sub>14</sub></small>B phase was lower than the total oxygen in the Nd–Fe–B alloy.</p><p class="otherpara">Trace levels of Ag in steels were determined by heated quartz tube atomization AAS with continuous flow gas phase sample introduction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> Gaseous silver hydride was evolved into a quartz atomizer from solution samples introduced into a mixture of tartaric acid and hydrochloric acid as reaction media with potassium tetrahydroborate as a reductant. The limit of detection was 0.4 ppb and 4.0% RSD was reported for 50 ppb Ag (10 replicates). An interference study of concomitant elements was also performed during this research. The results obtained using this method were in good agreement with values for certified samples.</p><p class="otherpara">The following section discusses investigations using multiple techniques to investigate ferrous metals. Depth profiling of Zn-based coatings on iron sheets by LA-ICP-MS and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (LA-ICP-OES) using different lasers was evaluated by Hrdlicka <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> A Nd:YAG laser was coupled to ICP-OES and an excimer ArF laser with a beam homogenizer was used with ICP-MS. Both systems gave depth profiling results similar to glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD-OES) and XRF. However, tailing was observed with both systems that erroneously enlarged the coating-substrate layer. The ArF laser was found to reduce this effect, but not eliminate it completely. In a paper by King and colleagues, GD-OES, optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the surface of different tool steels treated by the reactive diffusion of nitrogen and carbon.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> The treatment process, termed nitrocarburizing, was performed using different C loaded gases, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> carbon dioxide and natural gas and using different tool steel types.

Saita and Maenosono<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> synthesized FePt nano-particles of 4.5 nm mean diameter using iron(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) ethoxide and platinum(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) acetylacetonate as precursors and then used transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive XRF (TEM-EDX), ICP-OES, and XRD to characterize the particles. TEM-EDX measurements indicated that the nano-particles contained little oxygen or other impurities. The recycling of galvanized steel using chlorination was studied by Tee and Fray.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> Numerous techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), SEM, AAS and XRD were used to examine the reaction products. It was demonstrated that it was possible to remove zinc from iron at 800 °C using an air–chlorine mixture (at a flow rate of 400 : 40 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) which produced volatile zinc chloride. The authors concluded that the methodology described was a novel and cheap way of recycling galvanised steel scrap.</p><h3 id="sect400"><span class="b_heading">1.2 Non-ferrous metals and alloys</span></h3><span>Galbacs and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> reported on a portable <span class="italic">LIBS</span> instrument, built with a microscope using a Q-switched laser. It was observed that 7 multiple pulses separated by 25 ms, improved precision and enhanced emission from targets made of Al, Cu, Si, and Zn compared with single pulse experiments by factors of between 2.5 and 129. These improvements were attributed to reheating of the plasma by the multiple laser pulses. A microchip laser and a handheld spectrometer with an ungated CCD array were used to construct a miniature LIBS instrument, which was then used to analyze 30 reference aluminium alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> The laser emitted low energy pulses (4–15 μJ) with high repetition rates (1–10 kHz) at 1064 nm. LODs ranged from 0.05 to 0.14 wt% and measurement errors varied from 0.06–0.18% for the analytes Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Si and Zn. A calibration-free model for LIBS has been proposed by Yaroshchyk <span class="italic">et al.</span> whereby a database of emission lines was employed to create a theoretical spectrum based on the defined plasma parameters.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> Elemental compositions were calculated from the observed and theoretical spectra at different plasma conditions.

Single-pulse LIBS analysis of oil on paper substrates yielded LODs, on average, two-fold better than those obtained using flowing liquid jets, while double-pulse LIBS showed a four-fold improvement.

The phenomenon of the cloud point is widely utilized in separations and preconcentrations. The cloud point is observed when non-ionic surfactants at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration undergo a phase separation when the temperature is increased.

A high throughput procedure for screening combinatorial libraries using micro-XRF has been developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> This work was carried out as a response to the increasing threat of the use of chemical warfare agents in military campaigns and against civilians. The technique has been used to screen materials at the mesoscale level (tens to hundreds of microns) for elemental composition and this work described the use of a commercial instrument coupled with the inherent heteroatom elements within target molecules of the combinatorial reaction to provide rapid and specific identification of lead species. This was demonstrated by screening an oligopeptide library for selective binding of the degradation products of the nerve agent VX. The identified oligopeptides could be used as selective molecular receptors for sensor development. The micro-XRF screening method was non-destructive, required minimal sample preparation or special tags for analysis and the screening time depended on the desired sensitivity.

The analytes were previously leached (with the assistance of an ultrasonic probe) from solid matrices into a 5% (w/v) sodium carbonate solution. The phenols were acetylated to enhance their partition into the headspace, prior to purging them from the aqueous medium.

A portable LIBS was developed as a collaborative effort between the US Army Research Laboratory and Ocean Optics, Inc.

A field test with known samples and a blind test were run at a distance of 30 m from the sample. Many conventional techniques employed measure the nitro- group in the vapour phase in explosive materials. Significant disadvantages of these techniques however are false positives from nitrogen containing polymers such as melamine and polyamides, and the fact that they are limited to organic compounds with significant vapour pressures. The LIBS system gave correct identification of energetic compounds under such conditions in 19 out of 21 samples.

High precision Pb isotope abundance ratios were determined by multi-collector ICP-MS. Scatter plots of abundance ratios for pigments from Rubens, van Dyck and others exhibited a very narrow distribution forming a cluster. Comparisons of this data to Italian sample pigments from the same period revealed a clear distinction which is explainable by the distinct origin of raw materials for the pigments.

The spatial distribution of atomic and molecular species in the paint cross sections has led to the development of a new hypothesis on the reaction mechanism of the photodegradation of vermillion where two black and white reaction products are formed sequentially. Here it is proposed that the Hg<small><sup>0</sup></small> is deposited on the surface of the remaining HgS as elementary mercury nano-particles, which turns the vermillion black. An interesting piece of work elucidating the origin of colour in archaeological Egyptian blue and green pigments by XAFS at the Cu K-edge has been reported by Pages-Camagna <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> Previous work had found different Cu-bearing amorphous and crystalline phases in both pigments but the exact colouring mechanism could not be elucidated by SEM-EDX, TEM, XRD, micro-Raman and UV-visible spectroscopies. These phases were believed to be the origin of the blue and turquoise colours. Due to the precision of Cu speciation, XAFS data at the copper K-edge gave new insight into the origin of the colour in both pigments. In Egyption blue it was found that Cu<small><sup>II</sup></small> was mainly allocated in a square-planar site in a crystalline cuprorivaite phase, whereas in Egyptian green, the Cu<small><sup>II</sup></small> was allocated in a elongated octahedral site in an amorphous phase. Identification of inks and the order in which the ink layers are applied on a paper substrate are important factors in authentication of contemporary prints. LIBS has been used to determine the chemical composition and structural distribution of the constituent materials on prints.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit156"><sup><span class="sup_ref">156</span></sup></a> Acquisition of several spectra at the same location enabled identification of the order in which the inks were applied.

Determination of the thickness of the coating was based on the number of laser pulses required to penetrate the coating and on the ablation etch rate of the corresponding coating material under the same irradiation conditions. Although nanosecond pulses at 248 nm proved to be inadequate to profile the coatings because of their weak absorption at the laser wavelength, femtosecond pulses yielded well resolved profiles. Proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) has been employed as a non destructive analytical method for the identification of inks, pigments, dyes, surface layers and inorganic impurities in historic objects made of organic materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">158</span></sup></a> The measurement of elemental concentrations in these materials provides a sound basis for investigation of their composition and degradation processes. PIXE has been found to be a useful technique in evaluating the viability of a range of potential conservation procedures by measuring the elemental changes before and after the process has been carried out. It does however have several limitations but its major advantages are that it is sensitive, non-destructive and has good accuracy in determining composition and concentration distribution over a wide range of elements. Characterization of iron gall inks in historic hand written documents has been reported by Budnar and co-workers, utilising the non-destructive capabilities of PIXE.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159</span></sup></a> Here, the errors arising from the non-uniform ink deposit, proton penetration depth and diameter of the proton beam compared with the width of the ink strata as well as the PIXE geometry were discussed. It was concluded that the main errors were attributable to the fact that PIXE is a surface technique and that analysis is confined to a small area of the sample while ink deposits are usually not of uniform depth. Despite the uncertainties arising from these features of the technique the authors reported good correlation between determinations obtained by PIXE and AAS on model samples. Micro-XRF techniques have also been used by Hahn <span class="italic">et al.</span> for the qualitative and quantitative determination of Fe in gall inks, pencils and coloured crayons.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit160"><sup><span class="sup_ref">160</span></sup></a> The capabilities of LA-ICP-MS for depth profiling analysis of car paints have been explored and the use of the signal profiles for the forensic identification of vehicles involved in hit and run incidents was evaluated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> Depth-profiling of paint samples gave detailed information on the elemental composition of the individual layers (clear coat, base coat, primer surfacer and first primer). It was found that when using a quadrupole ICP-MS instrument the complexity of the matrix composition of some of the layers resulted in specific interferences, and significantly affected the signal profiles obtained especially for transition metals. The deviation of experimentally determined isotope ratios from the theoretical values was assessed as a useful indicator of spectral overlap. The use of a sector field instrument operated at medium resolution (<span class="italic">R</span> = 4000) permitted most interfering ions to be identified and documented on the basis of their accurate mass to charge ratios. The signal profiles thus obtained enabled car paints of the same colour to be discriminated from one another on the basis of elemental composition of the individual layers.</p><p class="otherpara">Catarino <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> have reported a method useful for the routine ETAAS measurement of Cu in red and white <span class="italic">wines</span> at a concentration of 1 to 50 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> by using a conventional thermal programme, although better results were obtained when using matrix modifiers (palladium and magnesium nitrates). The method involved reduced risk of sample contamination by eliminating prior treatment other than a one in five dilution. White and red wines with several Cu concentration ranges were used for method validation. Comparable values of concentrations were obtained by both ETAAS and ICP-MS. “Cork taint”, a musty-mouldy off-odour, represents one of the most serious problems in the wine industry.

The in-series use of ECD and ICP-MS detectors combine halogen sensitivity from the ECD with the selectivity of ICP-MS to confirm these compounds in complex matrices. A multivariate optimization approach was employed and the optimized method HS-SPME-GC-ECD-ICP-MS showed good detection limits for all the analytes as well as high precision and sample throughput.

Korenovska and Suhaj<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> proposed a model for traceability of Slovakian wines to different regions and differentiation from imported wines using elemental markers determined by AAS. Principal component analysis (PCA) and factoring (PCF) were used for elements variability determination and visualization of data. For the regional segregation of Slovakian wines according to the vineyard production areas, the Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Li, Mg, Rb, Sr and V markers resulted in a very efficient differentiation of Slovakian wines from many European ones. European wines differ in content mainly of Ca, Mg, Rb and Sr. The discrimination worked best for Portuguese, Italian, Spanish and partially for French wines. For geographical authentication, factor analysis of multi-element composition data was a more effective tool than PCA statistics.

The research group based in Munich have produced two papers relevant to this part of the review. In the first of these,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit204"><sup><span class="sup_ref">204</span></sup></a> Reithmeier and colleagues described the use of a new ToF system for AMS measurement of I-129. This instrument had a ToF resolution of 440 ps and an energy resolution of about 2% and was reportedly capable of determining <small><sup>129</sup></small>I/<small><sup>127</sup></small>I to a sensitivity of 10<small><sup>−14</sup></small>. This new instrument was applied to the determination of <small><sup>129</sup></small>I in rain water samples from the time period between July 2003 and October 2004. Overall, a decrease both in <small><sup>129</sup></small>I and in <small><sup>129</sup></small>I/<small><sup>127</sup></small>I was observed in these rain water samples when compared with those from 1988, 1989 and 1995. This was attributed to a decrease in <small><sup>129</sup></small>I emission from French reprocessing facilities. In the second paper, Huber and co-workers determined the long-lived radioisotope <small><sup>36</sup></small>Cl in granite samples exposed to the A-bomb neutrons at various distances from the Hiroshima hypocenter.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit205"><sup><span class="sup_ref">205</span></sup></a> It was found that very close to the hypocenter, the <small><sup>36</sup></small>Cl/Cl ratio was 1.6 × 10<small><sup>−10</sup></small>, but that this decreased to approximately 2 × 10<small><sup>−13</sup></small> further away (1200 m) and then stayed approximately constant. It was concluded that the <small><sup>36</sup></small>Cl had been produced by the neutron capture by stable <small><sup>35</sup></small>Cl. It was noted though that at distances further from the hypocenter, confounding processes arising from cosmic rays or neutrons from the decay of uranium and thorium may influence the results. Further study using both experimentation and calculation was to be performed to confirm this. The Vienna environmental research accelerator (VERA) is a 3 MV tandem accelerator. A paper by Steier and colleagues explored, using both modelling and by experimentation, the limitations arising from terminal voltage of this system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit206"><sup><span class="sup_ref">206</span></sup></a> They found that if no isobars exist, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> for U-236 and for Pu-244, then the instrument yielded similar LODs to those obtained using larger instruments. However, when isobar separation is required, the limiting factor was the achievable energy. By using a ToF detector and by pushing the tandem voltage up to 3.6 MV, it was possible to separate S-36 from Cl-36. A paper by many of the same authors described the determination of Pu in environmental samples from nuclear test sites in the South pacific by using AMS and alpha spectrometry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit207"><sup><span class="sup_ref">207</span></sup></a> The analyte was separated from the matrix using anion exchange and then prepared for alpha spectrometry by micro-precipitation with neodymium trifluoride. After alpha spectrometric analysis, the sample was re-processed for AMS analysis. This involved co-precipitation using iron(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) hydroxide. Pu-142 was used as an internal standard for both AMS and alpha spectrometry. The alpha spectrometry was capable of determining Pu-238 plus a mixture of Pu-239 and Pu-240, whereas the AMS was capable of separating and determining all the isotopes. It was noted though that, in general, the data obtained from the two techniques agreed to within 10%.

It was found that in the first of the tiles, H distribution in the re-deposited layer was uniform, with a H/C ratio of 0.03. The other tile showed a marked increase in H/C ratio, but this was found to diminish sharply to 1.3 × 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> in the bulk of the tile.

However, there are still some papers that describe its determination. Of these, two have been health-based applications. Squibb and McDiarmid determined the health effects associated with exposure to DU by Gulf War veterans that had been victims of “friendly fire”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> Using ICP-MS as a means of detection, it was found that those soldiers who had fragments of DU still embedded in them continued to excrete elevated levels of U in their urine.

However, subtle changes in the renal function of those individuals that contained a U concentration of greater than 0.1 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> creatinine indicated that there may still potentially be problems to come. Durakovic determined the concentrations and the precise isotope compositions of the U isotopes <small><sup>234</sup></small>U, <small><sup>235</sup></small>U, <small><sup>236</sup></small>U and <small><sup>238</sup></small>U in the urine of civilians from eastern Afghanistan.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit230"><sup><span class="sup_ref">230</span></sup></a> These individuals, that came complaining of fatigue, fever, respiratory impairment, headaches and neurological alterations, had their urine collected and analyzed for the four isotopes using MC-ICP-MS.

However, both the <small><sup>234</sup></small>U/<small><sup>235</sup></small>U and the <small><sup>234</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratios indicated that they had been exposed to natural U rather than DU. The <small><sup>236</sup></small>U, which is also usually associated with DU, was found to be below the LOD. Schimmack and co-workers undertook leaching experiments of DU in columns of soil.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit231"><sup><span class="sup_ref">231</span></sup></a> Two soil types that are common in Europe (a sandy-loamy cambisol and a silty-loamy luvisol) were used to fill a total of 16 columns, such that 3.3 kg of dry soil was added to each. Fragments from projectiles of DU, weighing between 145 and 294 g were placed in the columns. Effluents from the columns were collected weekly for a period of a year, giving a total of 648 samples for analysis by ICP-MS. Leaching from natural U was found to be at a rate of 0.01 μg week<small><sup>−1</sup></small> or less, whilst the leaching rate from DU was found to be far greater, at values of up to 100 μg week<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

Isnard and co-workers described a TIMS and a MC-ICP-MS method for the determination of Gd and Sm isotopes in spent nuclear fuels, ensuring that the mass bias phenomena associated with MC-ICP-MS was accounted for.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit232"><sup><span class="sup_ref">232</span></sup></a> This mass bias correction was achieved using an external standard bracketing approach and an exponential law fractionation correction. Unfortunately, there is a lack of isotope reference materials for these analytes, so the authors had to use a SPEX natural solution that is commonly used or ICP-MS determinations. Using the associated correction techniques and this natural solution for isotope calibration, the authors obtained a reproducibility of better than 0.1%. In the actual fuel samples, the Gd and Sm isotope ratios had a relative standard deviation of 0.2%. There have been two papers that have analyzed waste repository materials. This is obviously of great importance if the safe storage of radioactive materials is to be assured. In one of these papers, synchrotron-based X-ray microprobes were used to elucidate the spatial distribution and the speciation of radionuclides in a highly heterogeneous repository material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233</span></sup></a> The authors presented a case study of the uptake process of Co into the cementitious engineered barrier materials that had been exposed to microbial degeneration. In the other paper, Wilson <span class="italic">et al.</span> tested the stability of the montmorillonite clay surrounding of the steel container when it was in contact with native iron, magnetite and aqueous solutions under hydrothermal conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> Two series of experiments were conducted. In one series, sodium montmorillonite was mixed with magnetite, native iron, calcite and sodium chloride solutions and reacted at 250 °C for between 93 and 114 days. In the second series of experiments, the montmorillonite was mixed with native iron, and solutions of iron(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) chloride and then reacted at temperatures of 80, 150 and 250 °C for 90–92 days. The products were analyzed using techniques such as ICP-OES, ICP-MS, TEM, XRD and FT-IR. In the first series of experiments, the native iron was oxidized to form magnetite and the sodium montmorillonite was transformed into iron-rich smectite, but only when the iron was added as the metal rather than as the magnesite. The iron-rich smectite was initially rich in Fe(<span class="small_caps">II</span>), but this was oxidized in air to Fe(<span class="small_caps">III</span>). The material was found to have less expansion compared with the montmorillonite when exposed to ethylene glycol. In the second series of experiments, smectite was produced only at 250 °C. Overall, the experiments indicated that although bentonite (of which montmorillonite is the main constituent) is still a desirable choice of backfill material for high level nuclear waste repositories, it may lose some of its expandability if the clay is altered to an iron rich smectite. This, of course, is a possibility when the clay is the surround of a steel canister.</p><h2 id="sect1007"><span class="a_heading">Advance materials</span></h2><h3 id="sect1009"><span class="b_heading">3.1 Polymeric materials and composites</span></h3><span>This has been a relatively quiet area of research in this review period.

The method was validated by the analysis of the CRMs BCR 680 and BCR 681, with the results obtained being in good agreement with the certified or reference values. Another paper that used a wet digestion technique has been prepared by Sakurai <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit236"><sup><span class="sup_ref">236</span></sup></a> These authors used a domestic microwave oven to aid the decomposition of polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride.

The time required for the digestion in the microwave oven ranged from 5 min (for 20 mg) to 25 min (for 60 mg of sample). After evaporating most of the acid media, the sample digest was diluted, filtered if necessary and analyzed by ICP-OES for its Cd, Cr and Pb content. Again, the CRM BCR 680 polyethylene was used to validate the procedure.

The extent of matrix removal was sufficient for the successful determination of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn. It was noteworthy though that the calibration method of standard additions was necessary for accurate results to be obtained.

This obviously had adverse ramifications for the speed of the analysis though. Accurate results were obtained during the analysis, but the authors did emphasise that the use of an internal standard was required when samples that are different from the calibration materials are to be analyzed.

Several techniques were discussed including X-ray fluorescence microscopy (which determines the spatial distribution, elemental nature, size morphology and depth of particles as small as 30 nm in diameter), X-ray absorption microspectrocopy (which determines the chemical state of these particulates), X-ray beam induced current (XBIC, that maps the minority carrier recombination activity) and spatially resolved XBIC (maps the minority carrier diffusion length). The authors discussed the sensitivity and synchrotron characteristics of the techniques as well as producing experimental flow charts. Also discussed was the way that these techniques have elucidated the nature and effects of metal rich particles in multi-crystalline silicon and the physical mechanisms limiting metal gettering from it. There have been a number of applications based papers using XRF spectroscopy. One of the most interesting of these was by Lutzenkirchen-Hecht and colleagues who described a miniaturized cell that may be used for XRF as well as grazing incidence XRF and XRD analysis of thin films and their growth processes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> The construction of the cell was described in detail. Since it was of compact design and low weight, it could be used with conventional instrumentation. The authors presented the first results of its use and discussed how experiments that previously would have been restricted to synchrotron instrumentation, could now be performed with even basic equipment.

Results were validated by the independent methods of SEM and ICP-MS. Despite its drawbacks, the method was still fit for purpose. Hung and co-workers described the in-line use of XRF and X-ray reflectometry (XRR) to monitor the deposition of atomic layers on high-kappa dielectric films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> The XRR monitors the deposition rate of the thickness and identifies the transition from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional growth regime.

The proposed approach therefore enabled a real-time analysis, hence avoiding excess growth of the high-kappa interface or degradation of the film during measurement. In addition, it is non-invasive, requires no sample preparation and does not expose the sample to non-production environments. The authors’ in-line method was validated by the independent techniques of Auger electron spectroscopy and TEM.</p><p class="otherpara">Total reflection XRF (TXRF) has continued to be an area of interest in terms of analysis methods for electronic materials. Hellin and co-workers have been great exponents of this technique and have published a series of papers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252–254</span></sup></a> In the first of these, the authors discussed how silicon dioxide will be replaced by other materials with a higher dielectric constant, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> hafnium dioxide. They then went on to demonstrate how thin layers of this material are formed by atomic layer deposition using hafnium tetrachloride and water, and also comment that the properties of the material will be affected by residual ligands present as contaminants. The techniques of TXRF and grazing incidence XRF (GI-XRF) were used first to determine the Hf coverage in the nm thick layer and compared these results with those obtained by RBS. They also studied the selection of the most appropriate X-ray excitation source for the determination of impurities such as Cl in the layers. In the second of the applications by Hellin and co-workers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> the choice of excitation source was discussed in more detail. It was concluded that for optimal sensitivity, a combination of sources was required that can cover the entire range of analytes. For low z analytes a low energy excitation was required (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 5 keV produced by tungsten M alpha or chromium K alpha), whereas transition metals required a moderate energy excitation source, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> 10–20 keV produced by tungsten L beta or molybdenum K alpha. Analytes such as Mo, Pd, Ru and Zr required high energy excitation (25–35 keV), such as that produced by the tungsten continuum. The materials analyzed during this study included silicon and germanium substrates, high kappa dielectric contaminants and silicon wafers contaminated with elements from metal gates and copper interconnects. Using the optimized excitation sources, the authors obtained LODs of 10<small><sup>10</sup></small>–10<small><sup>11</sup></small> atoms cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Also discussed in this paper was the preconcentration technique of vapour phase decomposition–droplet collection (VPD-DC-TXRF), which can improve detection limits by two or even three orders of magnitude, depending on wafer size and the chemical collection efficiency. The use of this technique was demonstrated for noble metals in germanium substrates. The third paper discussed VPD-DC further.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit254"><sup><span class="sup_ref">254</span></sup></a> This preconcentration method as well as others such as droplet sandwich etch (DSE) can sometimes lead to TXRF saturation effects during the analysis of the micro-droplet residues. This was identified to be caused by a mass absorption effect of primary X-rays. This paper studied different approaches to overcoming these problems. Correction factors led to an over-estimation of the effect by 20%, whereas internal standardization approaches also failed because the internal standard was separated from the analytes during the drying step. The authors suggested an alternative method that employed the intensity of scattered primary X-rays. Using a DSE preconcentration on spin coated germanium wafers and the proposed correction method, an efficiency of 100% was achieved compared with only 40% without matrix removal. Von Bohlen and Klockenkamper have used TXRF for <span class="italic">depth profiling</span> studies of silicon wafers, quartz glass and vacuum-metallized multi-layers on silicon wafers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit255"><sup><span class="sup_ref">255</span></sup></a> The samples were first bombarded with low energy ions from a broad beam Kaufman-type ion source which sputtered ions from the surface layer. By using the TXRF as a means of detection, multi-analyte analysis was achieved. Repeated use of the sputtering technique enabled a depth profile to be made with a depth resolution of 3 nm. Unfortunately, the technique suffered the drawback of contamination. This arose because of ion implantation from the ion etching process. This implantation was confirmed by XPS analysis. Grazing exit (GE-XRF) is a new method of instrumental analysis that enables the determination of thin film compositions as well as providing information on depth distribution and intensities. Xu and co-workers, who described GE-XRF as the opposite principle of TXRF<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a> applied the technique to metal thin films on silicon substrates and mirror polished gallium arsenide. The XRF intensity was measured as a function of the exit angle for nearly normal X-ray incidence. The angular dependence of the grazing exit XRF intensity showed a sharp increase at the critical angle of K alpha, K beta radiation. Mori <span class="italic">et al.</span> have proposed a method they have called sweeping TXRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> This is a non-destructive technique for the entire surface characterization of metal contaminants on semiconductor wafers.

After MVPME had been performed, a fast ETAAS programme (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> no ash stage and using no modifier) was used for the analysis, with calibration being against simple aqueous standards. The performance of this method was compared with a traditional digestion using hydrofluoric acid (the matrix being removed as boron trifluoride on a hotplate) and a matrix elimination step using hydrofluoric acid that was incorporated into the ETAAS programme. The MVPME method yielded exceptionally low LODs which ranged from 0.5 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (Ni) to 2.9 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (Al). These low LODs were reported to be a function of decreased blank contamination. Matrix elimination has also been achieved by Mitsumata and Mori who determined 10 analytes in the natural oxide layer of a silicon wafer using ETV-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a> By adding hydrofluoric acid, the silica was boiled off at only 150 °C, hence removing the polyatomic interferences potentially arising from <small><sup>28</sup></small>Si<small><sub>2</sub></small> on <small><sup>56</sup></small>Fe and <small><sup>28</sup></small>Si<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> on <small><sup>60</sup></small>Ni. The use of palladium modifier (25 ng) also extended linearity of the calibration curves, leading to the possibility of determining the 10 analytes in the concentration range 20–10 000 pg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Spike/recovery experiments indicated that between 95 and 105% of the analytes added were detected, leading the authors to conclude that the protocol produced accurate results.

A similar approach has been taken by Wan and colleagues who prepared slurries of photoresist samples and silica particles in a mixture of hydrofluoric acid : nitric acid (1 : 9).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260</span></sup></a> After microwave heating, matrix elimination was found to be 99.7% and 99.9% efficient for the photoresist and the silica particles, respectively. The residue was analyzed by high resolution ICP-MS. Spiking experiments led to recoveries of the 15 analytes of between 96 and 108% for the photoresist and between 95 and 105% for the silica. The sample decomposition was described as being contamination free, hence leading to very low blank levels. Bleiner and co-workers have used LA-ICP-MS along with Monte Carlo simulations to perform depth-profile analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit261"><sup><span class="sup_ref">261</span></sup></a> A laser ablation induced plasma was used as a composition controlled source for the ion implantation and then LA-ICP-MS was used as the means of detection. A depth resolution of 10 nm was calculated to be necessary to define the shape of the implantation profiles, whilst a resolution of 100 nm was necessary to determine the total implanted dose. The authors concluded that the technique had great potential for depth profiling studies, even though it suffered from problems associated with pulse mixing and tailing of the transient signals arising from the aerosol transport. The authors tackled this problem using a series of algorithms to try and compensate.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Glow discharge</span> has again found limited use in this subject area, although of the four papers published, two were either reviews or overviews. An example is a paper by Pisonero and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> who discussed the role of GD spectrometry for the direct analysis of thin and ultra-thin solid films. This paper was discussed in more detail in Section 2.3. Nelis and Pallosi produced a review that focused on the analytical capabilities of GD-OES and GD-MS for depth profiling studies.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit262"><sup><span class="sup_ref">262</span></sup></a> The authors gave accounts of the properties of the Grimm-type GD and of the processes that occur during the sputtering. Several examples from recent literature were cited that discussed GD for depth profiling in samples as diverse as computer hard disks and mono-layers on copper substrates. Included in this discussion were the conditions required for obtaining nm or even atomic layer depth resolution. Also presented was a series of applications undertaken in the authors’ own laboratories, together with a discussion of some of the technique’s limitations and known problems. Another paper by Nelis <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the characterization of a pulsed RF, Grimm-type GD and its potential use for GD-OES analyses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> The effect of pulsing the power supply on the sputtering was investigated and the effects on emission yields for both resonant and non-resonant lines evaluated. It was found that pulsing the RF power enhanced the emission yield and that this was attributable to a temporal reduction of self-absorption. The technique was demonstrated during the analysis of several heat-sensitive, non-conductive materials and layers. The authors claimed that this work opened several avenues for further research. Audet and Cossette described the GD-MS analysis of ultra-pure cadmium telluride ingots prepared by the travelling heater method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> The presence of contaminants, even at ultra-low levels, in such samples can severely limit their performance. Hence, analytical techniques should be capable of determining as many analytes as possible at very low concentrations. In this paper, GD-MS determined that the total impurities content was 100 ppb of which Zn was the largest single component at 40 ppb. Unfortunately, this concentration of “total impurities” did not include C, N or O.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Depth profiling</span> is a subject area that, as always, has had intense research activity. Many of the applications published have been very straightforward and have not really contributed to increased knowledge of atomic spectroscopy. Instead, they simply use the atomic spectroscopy as a tool to aid in the development of a product or to investigate mechanistic aspects of a particular process. Many of these papers will therefore not be discussed in this review. It is clear that in modern technology, thin films are becoming ever more thin, with layers just a few nm thick being commonplace. This is therefore stretching the capabilities of many of the traditional analysis techniques. One of the techniques most commonly used for depth-profiling is <span class="italic">SIMS</span>. This is because of its high sensitivity and good depth resolution. A lengthy overview of SIMS containing 59 references has been prepared by McPhail.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> The SIMS process was described, the fundamental equations derived and the main terminology defined. Also included in this review was a description of the different types of SIMS analysis; <span class="italic">e.g.</span> static SIMS, imaging SIMS, depth-profiling SIMS and three dimensional SIMS. In addition, specialized analysis strategies such as the imaging of shallow bevels and cross sections and reverse side analysis were also discussed. A range of analytical examples in sample types as diverse as semiconductors, glass, stainless steel, micro-meteoroids, museum artefacts, aerospace alloys and biomaterials were discussed. The author also suggested some possible future directions and strategies for introducing SIMS to undergraduate education. As with all analytical techniques, SIMS analyses still require validation. Kim and co-workers have described the development of two B-doped silicon multiple delta layers as CRMs for SIMS depth-profiling analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> The two samples, with different delta layer spacing, were grown by ion beam sputter deposition. The sample for shallow junction analysis had a nominal spacing of 10 nm whereas the one for high energy SIMS had a spacing of 50 nm. These samples could be used to evaluate SIMS depth resolution and to calibrate the depth scale. The crater depths measured by a stylus profilometer showed a good relationship with the thickness measured from SIMS profiling using the calibrated film thickness for depth scale calibration. The sputtering rates of the two CRMs were found to be the same as that of the crystalline silicon substrate. Consequently, it was concluded that they may be used to validate the real analysis of crystalline silicon samples. Although an extremely advanced technique, SIMS is not invulnerable to interferences or other problems. Some of these have been highlighted in four papers published in this review period. Fearn and McPhail noted that as dopant profiles become shallower, much of the implant profile lies in the pre-equilibrium or transient region of a SIMS depth profile.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> In this region sputter yield and ionization rate can vary, which makes accurate quantification of the implant profile very difficult. The problems may be reduced by use of a much lower energy beam or by oxygen flooding of the sample. The authors note however, that many SIMS instruments do not have these capabilities. They therefore suggested an alternative method that is applicable to existing instrumentation. Fabrication of bevels with a very small slope angle on a shallow B implanted silicon sample followed by SIMS analysis of the exposed surface enables the depth profile to be obtained, especially when used in conjunction with an accurate measurement of the bevel morphology. The authors found that this ‘bevel-image’ profile compared well with the profile obtained using a 1 keV oxygen beam. They noted though that to obtain a good dynamic range it was necessary to clean the bevel using a hydrofluoric acid etch. A paper by Yang and co-workers described how primary beam ion mixing can be a major source of error, leading to over-estimation of junction depths during SIMS analyses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> The paper systematically studied the correlation between the implant profile trailing edge, the junction depth and the primary ion beam energy for low energy As and B implants. The authors found that use of a mathematical deconvolution model consistently improved the accuracy of the junction depth measurements. Janssens and co-workers experienced some problems during a SIMS study of dopant re-distribution during the silicidation process in partially nickel silicided plates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit268"><sup><span class="sup_ref">268</span></sup></a> This was because the ionization probabilities of As and B have a strong dependence on the nickel content. Also, the nickel and silicon intensities, which are required so that any variation in matrix composition may be monitored, were influenced by the SIMS conditions. Use of a caesium beam induced a serious broadening of the nickel profile, whereas an oxygen beam, when used at a low impact angle, pushed the nickel signal forward. In an attempt to circumvent these problems, the analysis was performed from both the front and the back side. Back side SIMS analysis was found to yield accurate results. Mayerhofer and colleagues have pointed out that despite ion implantations of common dopants in silicon being well characterized over the last 10 years, much of the data has been based on a few measurements or even extrapolations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> Also, experimental results have indicated that a 20% error can be obtained for Er implantation in silicon and silica when compared with simulations using SRIM, T2D and the authors’ own programme, IMSIL. Equal doses of Er were implanted in SIMOX wafers at energies of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 keV and the profiles in the resulting samples analyzed using SIMS. Relative sensitivity factors were calculated and the silicon–silica interface at exactly 217.7 nm was used to calibrate the depth scale and the interface position. These more precise experiments confirmed the authors’ previous results.</p><p class="otherpara">A large number of simple applications of SIMS has also been reported. As stated previously, these will not be discussed in any detail.

It was reported that under the conditions used, SIMS was capable of profiling N in the hafnium dioxide film with minimal matrix effects across the hafnium–silicon interface. This latter property was of particular use because the low yield of silicon-based secondary ions ensured that there was minimal mass interference from <small><sup>30</sup></small>Si<small><sup>−</sup></small> on <small><sup>14</sup></small>N<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>−</sup></small>.</p><p class="otherpara">The technique of ToF-SIMS has also received some attention in this review period.

Often, a whole arsenal of techniques is used, so experimental detail is often somewhat limited. However, some of the more interesting applications have been chosen to be discussed here. Multi-layer ceramic capacitors are electronic components that temporarily store electrical charges. They are primarily composed of inter-leaved layers of dielectric material (often modified barium titanate), internal electrodes (often nickel, palladium or an alloy of palladium–silver) and external electrodes. Kim and co-workers investigated a nano-coating process that produced a magnesium oxide layer onto barium titanate core powder.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276</span></sup></a> Several deposition routes were explored, the best being the use of a magnesium nitrate–urea system which, according to XRD data, produced a layer of Mg<small><sub>5</sub></small>(CO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>4</sub></small>(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·4H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. On calcination at 600 °C, this layer broke down into magnesium oxide. The outer shell was then characterized further by ICP-OES and XRF. Accurate determination of the composition of a superconductor (of the YBa<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cu<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> type) using the techniques of spectrophotometry, gravimetry and FAAS has been reported by Bruneel <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit277"><sup><span class="sup_ref">277</span></sup></a> After dissolution of the superconductor, Y was determined spectrophotometrically as the arsenazo-III complex, Cu was also determined spectrophotometrically but as the nitroso-R salt complex and the Ba was determined gravimetrically as the chromate and by FAAS. Results for the analyses were accurate (better than 0.7% error) and precise, with precision being typically better than 1.2% RSD. For the analysis of thin films of the material, FAAS was recommended as the analysis technique for Ba since the results produced were more reliable.

The accuracy and potential drawbacks of each of the techniques were discussed. Samples from several sources that had <small><sup>11</sup></small>B<small><sup>+</sup></small> implanted over a wide range of fluence (4 × 10<small><sup>13</sup></small>–3 × 10<small><sup>16</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) and energies (30 eV–10 keV) were evaluated during the study.

These procedures were tested using a variety of simulated samples ranging from single As species to mixtures of As<small><sup>V</sup></small> and As<small><sup>III</sup></small> with glass matrix elements. Losses of the analytes of interest were associated with both the alkaline fusion and microwave assisted HF treatments whilst the NaOH procedure did not result in complete digestion of “real” samples.

This approach also allowed discrimination of glasses with similar densities and refractive indices at the 99% confidence interval. Sampling strategies for the analysis of glass fragments by LA-ICP-MS were investigated in detail in terms of micro-homogeneity<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit283"><sup><span class="sup_ref">283</span></sup></a> and sample size and shape<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit284"><sup><span class="sup_ref">284</span></sup></a> in a pair of papers by Trejos and Almirall. The sample set consisted of fragments from 56 glass containers, 28 auto-windshields and 20 architectural glasses. For each sample set, the external and internal mean and precision derived from 10 replicates were estimated. The observed variations within a sample set could then be assigned to either the limitations of the analysis or to significant differences within the sample sets. The effect on the quantitative analysis of different size and shape fragments due to laser : surface interactions and heat dissipation were investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit284"><sup><span class="sup_ref">284</span></sup></a> Fragments from two standard materials, ranging from 6–0.2 mm in length were analyzed and no significant differences observed. These studies illustrate many of the problems that are inherent in direct solids analysis but also how these problems can be understood, characterized and resolved. The use of non-destructive analysis approaches in forensic analysis has obvious advantages and although LA-ICP-MS is often considered as providing pseudo-non-destructive analysis, XRF can be considered as a truly non-destructive technique. Suzuki <span class="italic">et al.</span> applied synchrotron-based XRF, in conjunction with refractive index measurements, to the discrimination of sheet glass fragments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit285"><sup><span class="sup_ref">285</span></sup></a> The XRF spectrum suggested that 6 elements (Ba, Ca, Ce, Fe, Sr and Zr) provided useful discriminators.

Sintering of the samples at 1250 °C for two hours yielded products that had a Si content of between 0.59 and 1.14%. These sintered powders were characterized by several techniques including XRF, XRD, attenuated total reflection infra-red (ATR-IR) spectroscopy and TEM. It was found that when the Si content was less than 0.59%, a mixture of the products Si-alpha tricalcium phosphate, Si-beta tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite was obtained. However, compositions containing greater than 1.14% Si produced the products silicon alpha tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite only.

Anzano and colleagues used LIBS to determine Al and other analytes in archaeological clays because it is a direct method (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> does not require a sample dissolution), is rapid and is non-sample destructive.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit293"><sup><span class="sup_ref">293</span></sup></a> During this study the authors determined the matrix effects experienced.

Depth-profiling studies for analytes such as Ca and Fe and the presence of Al and Si enabled the authors to discriminate between regions and between different time periods. Verification of the LIBS data was achieved using the complimentary technique of SEM-EDX.</p><p class="otherpara">Another technique that may be used for the direct and non-sample destructive analysis of historical ceramics is XRF. There have been several examples of such analyses published in this review period. Barone and co-workers used XRF with chemometric analysis of the data (cluster analysis) for the characterization of 79 fragments of ancient pottery.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit295"><sup><span class="sup_ref">295</span></sup></a> By determining concentrations of both major and trace analytes and then ratioing them against the silica concentration and using cluster analysis on this data, the authors managed to differentiate between the pottery from the regions of Catania, Lentini and Siracusa. Conversely, pottery from Messina was found to fall into two distinct groups. The authors used FTIR in an attempt to identify differences between these two groups. Padilla and co-workers highlighted the problems of XRF analysis of poor sensitivity towards some analytes (Cr, REEs <span class="italic">etc.</span>), poor precision and the inability to analyze some samples in the absence of suitable CRMs for calibration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit296"><sup><span class="sup_ref">296</span></sup></a> They attempted to overcome the sensitivity problem by combining two EDXRF methods, namely energy dispersive polarized excitation using secondary targets (EDPXRF) and radio-isotope XRF using an americium-241 source. They applied their technique to the analysis of Cuban aborigine pottery and compared the results with those obtained during a previous INAA study. <span class="italic">Portable XRF instrumentation</span> has been used to analyze archaeological pottery in three publications.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297–299</span></sup></a> In the first of these applications, a portable beam stability-controlled instrument developed in-house in Catania, Italy, was used to determine Nb, Rb, Sr, Y and Zr in 50 sherds of fine pottery from the San Francesco deposit by using a multi-linear regression method. As a test to determine the homogeneity of the samples, few examples were powdered and analyzed, also by a multi-linear regression method. A discussion of the results obtained using both methods was given. As a comparison, the powdered samples also underwent chemical analysis. The second of these papers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> reported the use of a portable EDXRF instrument for the analysis of pottery sherds at the El Hibeh archaeological site in Egypt. After determining the concentrations of Fe, Rb and Sr and plotting the data on a triangular scattergram, clear temporal and spatial separation of ceramic types could be observed. The authors discussed the geochemical behaviour of these analytes in relation to the geological source materials utilized for the pottery manufacture. Papadopoulou and co-workers reported the development and optimization of a portable micro XRF instrument with a mono-capillary lens for the <span class="italic">in situ</span> multi-element analysis of ancient ceramics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> These authors gave a brief discussion of the advantages of non-destructive, <span class="italic">in situ</span> analyses and then performed a series of experiments designed to optimize their instrument’s performance.

A series of CRMs was used for these studies including SARM 69 (ceramic), SRM 620 (soda-lime), NCS DC 73332 and the reference materials AWZ-1 and PRI-1. Once optimized, the instrument was used for the quantitative analysis of ancient ceramics from Abdera, Northern Greece.</p><p class="otherpara">Several other analytical techniques have been used for the analysis of archaeological ceramics. Cochrane and Neff used LA-ICP-MS for the provenance analysis of 260 Fijian sherds.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a> Their data demonstrated three compositional groups over a 2700 year sequence and suggested that accepted theories of interaction in the south West Pacific would have to be re-evaluated.

Unfortunately, trace element data alone were insufficient for characterizing samples from Yaozhou because they had much greater variability. However, the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio had a very small variability and the ratio for the Yaozhou samples was much lower than that of the Jizhou samples which, as well as having a much higher ratio, also had a much larger variability. The authors concluded that the Sr isotope ratio analyses have a great potential for characterizing ceramics of low Rb/Sr ratio, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> kaolin clays, but are of limited use in high Rb/Sr materials such as porcelain stone.

The methodology could distinguish between samples from the two sites and was also capable of identifying modern fakes. Xiang and co-workers reported an ETV-ICP-MS method that was capable of analyzing slurried samples of ancient porcelain.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit303"><sup><span class="sup_ref">303</span></sup></a> A PTFE modifier was found to remove the silicon matrix at 1200 °C effectively, whilst leaving the analytes un-volatilized and ready for determination. The particle size was found to be an important factor, with particles of less than 57 μm being required for complete volatilization. Similarly the concentration of the slurry was found to be important, with concentrations of greater than 0.8 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> causing matrix interferences. Under the optimized conditions, REEs could be determined accurately giving LODs of between 0.7 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (Eu) and 33.3 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (Nd), with precision of between 4.1% for Yb and 10% for La (at a concentration of 1 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, <span class="italic">n</span> = 9).

A very similar paper to the last one described has been published by Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit304"><sup><span class="sup_ref">304</span></sup></a> These workers used ETV-ICP-OES and a modifier of PTFE for matrix removal during the determination of REEs in zirconium dioxide powders. The zirconium matrix was volatilized away as the tetrafluoride species leaving the analytes to be vaporized from an interference free matrix. Absolute LODs ranged from 0.04 ng (Yb) to 0.5 ng (Pr) and the precision was reported as being better than 5% RSD. Results from this procedure were compared with those obtained using pneumatic nebulization of samples that had previously had the matrix eliminated by a solvent extraction method. Good agreement was found. Peschel and co-workers described an ETV-sector field-ICP-MS system that was equipped with an array detector.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit305"><sup><span class="sup_ref">305</span></sup></a> The instrument was being tested to see how it coped with the detection of a large number of transient signals.

The dynamic range covered 3–5 orders of magnitude for many of the analytes, but was found to be limited by the ETV device. Trace amounts of Cu, Fe and Ga were determined in the alumina powders directly at the 2–270 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level without the need for a modifier for matrix removal. Results were found to be in agreement with literature values for the Cu and Fe, but the Ga was found to deviate substantially (by 50%). Krivan and Janickova described a solid sampling ETAAS system for the direct determination of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Ni and Zn in zirconium dioxide samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> These workers also managed to separate the matrix from the analytes without recourse to a matrix modifier. The analytes were found to volatilize efficiently whilst the refractory matrix could simply be tipped off the platform after the analysis. Calibration was achieved by pipetting aqueous standards onto the matrix residue of a previous sample. Although this is of somewhat dubious scientific validity because the analyte will not soak into the matrix and hence will volatilize more easily than those present naturally in the sample, the results still proved to be accurate. The accuracy was proved by comparison of the results obtained with those obtained using radiochemical NAA and by ETAAS using liquid sampling of digested samples and slurries. Detection limits for the nine analytes ranged between 0.06 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (Cd) and 2.3 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (Fe). Two other papers have described novel methods for the direct analysis of solid ceramic samples. The development and characterization of a new, relatively inexpensive, computer-controlled particle sample introduction system to an ICP-OES instrument has been described by Greib and Karanassios.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit306"><sup><span class="sup_ref">306</span></sup></a> The device was designed to introduce non-hygroscopic particles of ng range weight (or samples that can be ground to form such particles) at a delivery rate that is controlled by a programme. The system was tested in three modes. The first was where sample diluted with graphite powder was introduced continuously for 5–10 s producing a steady state signal akin to a nebulizer. The second mode used a “puff” of sample, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> sufficient sample to form a transient peak was introduced. The third mode was similar to the second, but used a much smaller “puff”. In this mode, puffs with a frequency in the kHz range could be introduced enabling individual particles to be analyzed. Assuming plasma over-load was avoided, all three modes of operation produced linear calibrations. Precision was dependent on sample type, with Ni being determined in a homogeneous CRM yielding a precision between 3.1 and 4.2% RSD, but in a heterogeneous soil sample, the precision degraded to 50% RSD. The authors applied the device to the determination of W in powdered tungsten carbide ceramics. The analysis was assisted by the introduction of sulfur hexafluoride to the ICP. The authors concluded that their sample introduction device offered several advantages over other particle introduction devices reported in the literature.

The first mode used the signal from Al, a matrix component, the second mode measured Fe, a trace element within the sample and the third mode added Co at a concentration of 200 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Results indicated that only the Al internal standardization method produced reliable results and that a particle size of less than 10 μm produced no systematic influence on the accuracy. The analytes Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, Mn, Ni, V and Zn were determined, yielding LODs in the range 0.7–7 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

The extent of the ion exchange was determined by XRD and XRF. The properties of the analcime as well as the process parameters on the particle size, shape and structure of the product were all studied.

The authors heated the samples at 1200 or 1300 °C and then after this pre-treatment, they added a few drops of analyte solution to the surface and allowed it to undergo diffusion at either 1200 °C for 48 h or 1300 °C for 21 h. It was found that the diffusion profiles were very similar for all the lanthanides. In the last of these papers, Lesage <span class="italic">et al.</span> studied O diffusion through scandium doped (<span class="italic">via</span> a nitrate route) or titanium doped (isopropoxide route) alpha alumina grains.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> The dopants are often segregated or precipitated in grain boundaries. Therefore the rate of O diffusion in these boundaries will depend on the dopant concentration. The authors studied O diffusion at two concentrations of the dopants (again 100 and 1000 ppm) and through various grain sizes (varied by changing the sintering conditions). Samples were first heat-treated in a pure O-16 atmosphere and then, at a temperature of either 1000 or 1200 °C, O-18 introduced and allowed to diffuse through the sample <span class="italic">via</span> an O-16/O-18 exchange process.

The compositions of the zeolite matrices were very similar, with nominal Si/Al and Si/Fe ratios of 36 and 152, respectively. Removal of the template by calcination led to extensive de-alumination in Fe-beta, while having no influence on the state of Al in Fe-ZSM-5. Steam treatment was required to massively create extra-framework Al species in the latter sample. In contrast, the sensitivity of framework Fe to migration into non-framework positions during post-synthesis treatments and the nature and distribution of the resulting Fe species were remarkably analogous in the two zeolite structures. Catalytic tests with direct N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O decomposition and N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O reduction with CO over the steamed iron zeolites confirmed that the microporous matrix intrinsically did not play a decisive role on the activity in these reactions providing that the resulting forms of Fe were similar.
