to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> Although an attempt is made to consider all relevant refereed papers, conference abstracts, reports, book chapters and patents for inclusion in this review, the content of the review is highly selective. The selection of papers is based on criteria applied to focus sharply on the most significant developments in instrumentation and methodology or improved understanding of the fundamental phenomena involved in the MS process. With the increasing importance of speciation and the blurring of boundaries between atomic and molecular MS, a high degree of judgement is required in considering papers for inclusion. The main ruling criterion for all speciation papers is that the work should involve or be intended for the study of natural systems. For example, the study of synthetic metal clusters is generally not included whereas the determination of organometallic compounds in environmental samples
is.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Applications of atomic MS are not covered in this Update and readers are referred to the Updates on Industrial analysis: metals, chemicals and advanced materials,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> Environmental analysis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> and Clinical and biological materials, food and beverages.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> There have been few general reviews of note. That of Walczyk<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> gave a good introduction to the use of inorganic MS in human nutrition research.</span></p><p><span class="italic">The trends noted over the last few years have continued. In particular, the growing interest in speciation studies has been reflected by the number of papers on the subject. As the number of species identified increases then the danger of relying solely on chromatographic retention times for identification has become a recurring warning in papers. For this reason, the importance of GDMS, ESMS and S-SIMS for species identification has been widely recognised.
In all these studies, sample preparation and introduction have generally received most attention, with the aim of ever improved analysis. The increasing use of multicollector ICP-MS instruments for isotope geology studies has resulted in common ground with traditional TIMS methods, in particular in sample preparation.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Throughout this review, the term molecular ion will be restricted to denote only the positive or negative radical ion formed by removal or capture, respectively, of an electron. In contrast, addition of a proton or cation to a neutral molecule gives molecular adduct ions. Deprotonated molecules are considered as fragments.</span></p></div><hr/><h2 id="sect497"><span class="a_heading">1 Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)</span></h2><h3 id="sect500"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Reviews</span></h3><span>There have been relatively few <span class="italic">general reviews</span> of AMS in the period covered by this Update. That of Tuniz<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> focused principally on the applications of AMS, in particular the use of long-lived radionuclides as tracers and chronometers in many disciplines, including environmental science, archaeology and biomedicine. Curiously, the paper quoted no references with the result that it was of limited value in following up on a particular topic.</span><p class="otherpara">The development and application of compact radiocarbon instruments for use in <span class="italic">biomedical and pharmaceutical research</span> is the main growth area of AMS. A number of informative articles<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7–10</span></sup></a> from researchers with direct experience were of particular value. Not only were the attractions of the technique highlighted but also current limitations and the need for improvements. Major limitations of the technique were the inability to provide chemical or structural information and, in pharmaceutical applications, the need to incorporate the radioisotope label within the molecule of interest. The rate-limiting step in the analysis of samples remained the sample preparation. In general, increased use of AMS in biomedical applications will depend on the availability of small and cheap instrumentation and development of new methods for the processing of samples. On-line chromatography was considered to be a solution for increasing sample
throughput and structural information. A limitation with no obvious solution was a shortage of human subjects prepared to receive doses of radiocarbon-labelled drugs even at the very low level made possible by AMS.</p><h3 id="sect509"><span class="b_heading">1.2 Instrumentation</span></h3><span>Development of small AMS systems is now commonly included in the <span class="italic">regular upgrades</span> carried out at most facilities. Southon<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> gave an overview of recent developments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that illustrated some of the current trends in AMS as a whole. Developments included the construction of two small spectrometers dedicated to <small><sup>14</sup></small>C and <small><sup>3</sup></small>H measurements for biomedical applications. A feature of the <small><sup>3</sup></small>H spectrometer was its compact size due to the use of a single rf quadrupole both to accelerate particles and to perform mass selection. Initial tests indicated that <small><sup>3</sup></small>H∶H ratios as low as 10<small><sup>−15</sup></small> could be measured. In a contrasting development, the mass range of a high-energy instrument was doubled for the measurement of the actinides through provision of a new beamline. Redesign of the ion source was aimed at improving reliability and ease of maintenance, increasing
output and reducing sample-to-sample memory effect. The importance of good chemistry in the continuing development of AMS was illustrated by the need for good separation of <small><sup>63</sup></small>Ni from <small><sup>63</sup></small>Cu in copper samples. This extremely difficult separation was accomplished using a two-stage process involving controlled electrolytic deposition of copper and reaction of Ni with CO to form gaseous nickel carbonyl.</span><p class="otherpara">Friedrich <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> gave preliminary details of an instrument with an air-insulated 100 kV tandem accelerator dedicated to the <span class="italic">depth profiling of samples with high <small><sup>3</sup></small>H concentrations</span>. A dedicated instrument was essential in order to avoid contamination of an accelerator used for other applications and to safeguard workers from exposure to radioactivity. Initial tests with a carbon foil stripper (40 µg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) gave beam losses of up to 98% and unstable operation conditions. Use of a nitrogen gas stripper improved transmission to about 10% with high stability and reproducibility.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Injection systems with 90° magnets</span> have been seen as the key to improved performance of low energy (3 MeV) facilities. The Lund system has been developed for the measurement of <small><sup>26</sup></small>Al<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> and heavy ions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> A serious limitation of the original injector design when ion masses heavier than <small><sup>14</sup></small>C were measured was the use of only a single focusing injection magnet with a bending angle of just 15°. The new injector design, incorporating both an electrostatic and a 90° magnetic analyser, improved mass and energy separation by up to a factor of ten. The use of this injector in the measurement of <small><sup>26</sup></small>Al reduced the interference from Mg by two orders of magnitude and a new ion source increased the beam current threefold. These modifications improved the LOD for <small><sup>26</sup></small>Al from 10<small><sup>−14</sup></small> to about 10<small><sup>−16</sup></small> g. A first-order analytical technique was
applied to ion-optical calculations used in the design of the new injector.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> Facilities for AMS are now available in India following an upgrade to a 3 MV accelerator facility to include an AMS beam line for <small><sup>10</sup></small>Be and <small><sup>14</sup></small>C measurements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> The entire injection system was replaced by a commercial, state-of-the-art, fast-bouncing injector consisting of a 45° spherical electrostatic analyser and a 90° injection magnet.</p><h3 id="sect542"><span class="b_heading">1.3 Developments in radiocarbon analysis</span></h3><span>The <span class="italic">review on AMS radiocarbon analysis in the earth sciences</span> by Kang <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> provided a useful introduction to the development of the technique. Examples of carbon cycle studies included the monitoring of atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentrations, marine carbon cycles and stable isotope studies.</span><p class="otherpara">Improvements in sample preparation techniques have been crucial for the use of <span class="italic">compound-specific radiocarbon analysis (CSRA)</span>, in particular for the analysis of individual components in atmospheric and marine samples. Matsumoto <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> analysed individual fatty acids in an aerosol sample following separation by preparative capillary GC. A limitation of this approach was the need to perform 60 consecutive GC runs in order to isolate μg quantities of the individual fatty acids. The C<small><sub>16</sub></small> to C<small><sub>22</sub></small> fatty acids had modern <small><sup>14</sup></small>C ages, suggesting that the acids were emitted from living plants or marine organisms. The C<small><sub>24</sub></small> to C<small><sub>26</sub></small> fatty acids, on the other hand, had much older <small><sup>14</sup></small>C ages, suggesting that they had been stored in geochemical reservoirs for thousands of years prior to being emitted to the atmosphere. The recent development of radiocarbon AMS for small samples (200 µg–1
mg C) allowed Megens <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> to use CSRA for the characterization of particulate organic matter in coastal waters. A sequence of chemical treatments separated polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and compounds resistant to hydrolysis. Temporal variations in <small><sup>14</sup></small>C∶<small><sup>12</sup></small>C ratios were observed for the first time and used to identify the origin of the particulate matter as being phytoplankton with young <small><sup>14</sup></small>C ages or resuspended surface sediments with much older (up to 7300 years)
<small><sup>14</sup></small>C ages.</p><p class="otherpara">Obtaining a reliable estimate of the biogenic sources of <span class="italic">volatile organic compounds</span>
(VOC) is an essential step towards framing legislation for control of particulate matter emissions. In a study of samples taken at four European sites, Larsen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> used radiocarbon analysis of bulk airborne carbonyl compounds after collection on 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine-coated silica gel cartridges and chromatographic isolation of the hydrazones formed. This analysis of the samples by HPLC-chemical ionization MS provided their species composition. At all sites the carbonyl compounds were of mixed biogenic and anthropogenic origin but it was concluded that the background levels were predominantly (50–80%) of a biogenic origin. An assumption of the approach was that anthropogenic VOC in the atmosphere was of fossil origin with old <small><sup>14</sup></small>C ages.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Protein sequencing at the attomole level</span> using Edman degradation has been achieved through the use of AMS as a detection system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> Fractions collected from an automated sequencer were graphitized using standard procedures. Typical AMS measurement times were 3 minutes per sample with a counting precision of 1.4–2.0% and a RSD of 1–3%
(<span class="italic">n</span>
= 3–7). Currently the method can only be used for <small><sup>14</sup></small>C-labelled proteins but methods were being developed for extrinsic labelling of proteins to provide labelled amino acids. Although the method was considered promising for protein sequencing at the attomole level, improved sample throughput and wider availability of low cost instruments were seen as necessary for widespread application.</p><p class="otherpara">The use of freeze-drying instead of dissolution in chloroform for the disruption of microbial cells allowed Rumpel <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> to avoid the possible contamination of the sample with C. They demonstrated the possibility of measuring the <small><sup><span class="italic">14</span></sup></small><span class="italic">C activity in soil microbial biomass at natural <small><sup>14</sup></small>C abundance</span> following direct extraction of freeze-dried soil. This method provided a tool to determine the dead carbon content in soil microbial biomass and thereby to follow the degradation of fossil material (<span class="italic">e.g</span>., lignite) in soil.</p><h3 id="sect584"><span class="b_heading">1.4 Developments in the analysis of elements other than carbon</span></h3><span>Comparison of three different techniques (Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, RBS; elastic recoil detection analysis; and AMS) for <span class="italic">tritium depth profiling</span> in the inner walls of fusion experiments revealed differences of up to an order of magnitude in the results.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> This was considered to fall within the uncertainties of the techniques, due mainly to surface roughness and poor counting statistics. The most sensitive method for measuring small amounts of <small><sup>3</sup></small>H was AMS. This technique also allowed analysis to be performed to greater depths (several µm) than was possible with the other, low energy, techniques. A key to obtaining good depth resolution was the avoidance of crater effects by moving the target holder, mounted on an <span class="italic">x-y</span> scanning unit, in front of the Cs ion sputter beam and only accepting secondary ions produced at the centre of the analysed spot.</span><p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">half-life of <small><sup>79</sup></small>Se</span>, a long-lived fission product, has been recalculated as being about one third lower than its previous value.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> The use of projectile X-ray detection in the AMS analysis allowed effective separation of <small><sup>75</sup></small>Se and <small><sup>79</sup></small>Se from isobaric <small><sup>75</sup></small>As and <small><sup>79</sup></small>Br, respectively. The background ratio of &lt;10<small><sup>−10</sup></small> for both <small><sup>79</sup></small>Se∶Se and <small><sup>75</sup></small>Se∶Se was negligible in comparison to the measured ratios in samples of 10<small><sup>−7</sup></small>–10<small><sup>−8</sup></small>. The half-life of <small><sup>79</sup></small>Se was measured relative to that of <small><sup>75</sup></small>Se, which is known with high precision.</p><p class="otherpara">Determination of U and the transuranic elements in marine samples by AMS is proving to be a powerful tool for monitoring emissions from nuclear reprocessing plants and fallout from nuclear weapon testing. Marsden <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> developed a method for the <span class="italic">determination in environmental samples of <small><sup>236</sup></small>U</span>, which is produced only by neutron irradiation of U and is a potential marker for anthropogenic U in the environment. Sample preparation was based on the radiochemical separation of U from sediment samples using TRU.spec resins. Analysis of blank samples revealed a sensitivity of 10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> for the <small><sup>236</sup></small>U∶<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratio which is adequate for analysis of contaminated samples but not for samples taken further away from reprocessing plants. In order to reduce the number of <small><sup>238</sup></small>U ions reaching the detector and being counted as <small><sup>236</sup></small>U ions, a velocity filter was to be installed after the
final magnetic analysis. Samples taken from close to the Sellafield fuel reprocessing plant revealed levels of <small><sup>236</sup></small>U substantially above natural concentrations, with the implication that the U is preserved to some extent in the sediments and may reflect discharge history.</p><p class="otherpara">The study of Np in the environment is of increasing interest because of its relatively high mobility, its incorporation into the environment and the time scales involved. An AMS method for the <span class="italic">determination of <small><sup>237</sup></small>Np</span> in water samples extracted from marine sediments was found to have the required sensitivity to analyse samples of limited volume (700 ml) and low activity (0.06–0.79 mBq l<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 2.30–30.3 pg l<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> Neptunium was separated from matrix elements and other transuranic elements using an ion-exchange method and <small><sup>242</sup></small>Pu added as an internal standard. Targets, prepared by mixing samples with iron and aluminium, were sputtered with a Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> beam to produce NpO<small><sup>−</sup></small> and PuO<small><sup>−</sup></small> ions. Although the method was considered to be capable of measuring amounts as low as 0.4 µBq (3.9 × 10<small><sup>7</sup></small> atoms),
this was in practice not possible because of a systematic low level <small><sup>237</sup></small>Np contamination in each sample derived from the <small><sup>239</sup></small>Np yield monitor used in the separation procedure. Elimination of this contamination would give a method for the determination of very low concentrations in samples of limited volume.</p><p class="otherpara">A comparison of several procedures for the <span class="italic">determination of Pu isotopes</span> in the marine environment showed that the two MS techniques (AMS and ICP-MS) were highly sensitive and useful tools for identifying the origin of Pu.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> The sample preparation up to the final step was the same for both procedures and was based on several co-precipitation and chromatography steps. Sample targets for AMS analysis were prepared by mixing with iron and aluminium. In comparison to ICP-MS, the advantages of AMS were the low LOD (&lt;10<small><sup>6</sup></small> atoms of <small><sup>239</sup></small>Pu), which minimized sample size requirement, and low matrix and interference effects, which removed the need for complete sample clean-up. On the other hand, AMS analysis was more complex and expensive. Analysis of IAEA RM allowed the origin of Pu in the samples to be identified.</p><h2 id="sect636"><span class="a_heading">2 Glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS)</span></h2><h3 id="sect639"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Instrumentation</span></h3><span>Hyphenated techniques, in which a molecule-specific chromatographic separation is coupled to an atomic detector, are becoming more commonly adopted in order to try to overcome the disadvantages of atomic detection used on its own. Gibeau <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> modified a <span class="italic">particle beam (PB)-LC-MS instrument for LC-GDMS speciation analysis</span> of alkyllead compounds and selenoamino acids. A copper target electrode was mounted through the direct insertion probe lock. The 1–10 µm particles from the PB interface were dissociated by impact on this target and diffused into the negative glow plasma, where they were ionized. A 1 mm orifice was used for extraction into the quadrupole mass analyser. The source was operated with Ar at 8 × 10<small><sup>−3</sup></small> Torr. Alkyllead compounds could be selectively measured in the presence of lead nitrate by monitoring the RPb<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions (R = organic group). Whereas the
LOD of Pb using atomic ions was 2.98, 0.82 and 0.18 ng for lead nitrate, diethyllead and triphenyllead, respectively, use of molecular ions worsened the LOD of alkyllead compounds by a factor of about 20. This was considered negligible in view of the specificity provided by molecular analysis. Redesign of the hollow cathode was seen as a means of improving vaporization and ionization significantly.</span><p class="otherpara">Song <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> designed a <span class="italic">see-through type hollow cathode GD cell</span> for analysis of gaseous and solid samples in a portable MS instrument for field applications. The hollow cathode was preferred over a Grimm type cell because of the stability of its plasma. A skimmer was used to interface the cell to an ion trap made in-house. Use of helium as buffer gas improved the Penning ionization process. Feasibility tests yielded spectra similar to those obtained by conventional electron ionization in the gas phase.</p><p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">simple, small dc GD ion source for direct analysis of planar solids</span> described by Pisonero <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> was designed to be interchangeable with the ICP source in a commercial on-axis TOFMS instrument.

Because the subsurface can no longer generate speciation information, static SIMS (S-SIMS) limits the primary ion dose in such a way that only a fraction of the upper monolayer is sputtered. As a result, molecular information on both inorganic and organic analytes can be obtained but depth profiling is not possible. For the latter application, primary ion bombardment is achieved at high current density in dynamic SIMS, abbreviated in this review to SIMS. The fast erosion of the subsequent sample layers allows information on the depth distribution of elements to be obtained. The high transmission and inherent panoramic recording make TOF mass analysers particularly suited to S-SIMS experiments but are also of advantage in dynamic SIMS for simultaneous multi-element depth profiling.
Although the term TOF SIMS is widely used to denote S-SIMS, this review will make an explicit distinction between TOF S-SIMS and TOF SIMS. To further emphasize the difference between both methods, S-SIMS papers will be covered in a separate section 6.6.</span><p class="otherpara">The SIMS literature of last year reflects the increasing use of modelling to push the limits in ultrashallow depth profiling. Improved understanding of beam-induced artefacts is needed to refine the depth resolution function (DRF), which is used to convert the experimental depth profile into the “original” distribution. On the other hand, the use of polyatomic primary ions for depth profiling has emerged as an efficient alternative to low energy monoatomic ions under optimized incidence angle. The incidence and emission angles, mentioned throughout this section, are expressed as the angle between the ion beam and the normal to the sample surface. Applications of S-SIMS for the study of organic compounds are increasing in number but these fall outside the scope of this review.</p><h3 id="sect1720"><span class="b_heading">6.1 Instrumentation</span></h3><span>Seki <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> designed a <span class="italic">sealed-cone-type liquid metal ion gun (LMIG) to produce Li<small><sup>+</sup></small></span> primary ions, the low mass of which should reduce sample damage and space charge effects, thereby improving focusing.

Numerous observations were made on matters relevant to intrinsic biological isotope ratios, the current status of SIRMS for PSIA and the information that could potentially be provided by this technique. A key to PSIA analysis is sample preparation and derivatization, which must preserve the isotope ratios representative of those in the parent analyte. For this reason, chemical alteration that does not add extraneous C to the analyte is preferred. Open-tube pyrolysis has been shown to be an effective method for determining the carbon isotope ratios of structural fragments with high precision. It proceeds
through a free-radical mechanism that does not measurably scramble aliphatic C positions.

sacrificed to allow the sample chamber to be heated. The second was used for calibration. The third standard sample was NIST SRM 120c (phosphate-bearing sediment). To measure only the phosphate oxygen component of biogenic apatite, a pretreatment was required to remove non-phosphate oxygen (carbonate, hydroxyl, water and organic matter). Although heating at 1000 °C removed all the non-phosphate oxygen, some samples were susceptible to oxygen exchange with atmospheric water. Samples were instead heated to 400 °C to remove organic matter and fused by laser within the sample chamber under high vacuum to remove remaining water and carbonate. Results from the analysis of teeth from modern rodents showed that single teeth could not be used because of large variations within both a single specimen and a population. Hence, a mean of the analysis of at least five post-weaning teeth was used for palaeoclimate reconstruction.</p><p class="otherpara">A major thrust in SIRMS analysis in recent years has been the development of continuous flow (CF) methods as more rapid and convenient alternatives to the traditional dual-inlet techniques.

Such conditions are seldom encountered in SIRMS and the potential for significant error is great. The “pointwise” correction was more versatile and could be used when peak shapes and sizes and background signals varied significantly. Limitations remained, however, and accuracy was restricted by signal-broadening effects
of electronic time constants, the analog-to-digital conversion frequency and the highest frequency of the sample signal. Analog-to-digital conversion rates of at least 4 Hz and electronic time constants of &lt;500 ms were recommended to minimize errors under typical GC conditions. Using the pointwise algorithm, a series of 14 homologous n-alkanes with concentrations over a five-fold range could be analysed with a mean precision of 2.3‰ and no systematic error.

Detailed discussion was presented of the author's experience, with additional examples taken from the literature, of triple and single filament sample loading procedures and of three TIMS techniques. Static MC analysis was the most commonly used approach and had two primary benefits—insensitivity to changes in ion beam intensity and relatively high <small><sup>230</sup></small>Th count rates—which improved counting statistics. A limitation was the need to correct for inter-collector gain variability. The ionization efficiency using a single Re filament was improved by loading Th (50–100

Unlike resistively heated filament-type thermal ion sources, the TIC is heated by electron bombardment and can sustain temperatures &gt;2300 °C for several hours. The basic design characteristics, typical operating parameters and isotope ratio performance of the instrument were discussed in detail. Although the coupling of a continuous thermal ion source to a pulsed TOFMS instrument was unusual, the panoramic registration capability of TOFMS made it potentially useful for rapid isotope ratio measurement. An advantage of the cavity over the traditional filament for ionization was its ability to generate ion beams directly from solid particles, thereby reducing considerably the need for complex sample preparation. However, reducing the sample preparation
increased the risk of isobaric interferences. This could be overcome to some degree by treating samples with colloidal carbon to eliminate numerous metal oxide peaks and by measuring isotope ratios at specific times during a carefully controlled thermal gradient. Samples (sub-µg) were loaded into a high-purity (&gt;85%) tungsten cavity, which was inserted into the ion source on a direct insertion probe. The system had a mass resolution of 750–850 (FWHM) over a wide range of masses. A complete multielement analysis from sub-µg samples took less than 30–45 min.

Deyhle<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> gave a very good summary of the historical development of B isotope analysis and of the problems associated with each approach. The author analysed NIST boric acid SRM 951, using static multicollection of CsBO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ions, with the objectives of improving precision and accuracy and of establishing the critical amount of B required. Some of the key improvements to analysis were made to filament loading and heating procedures. Prior to sample loading, tantalum filaments were degassed and allowed to oxidize for three days. Whereas in previous studies samples were loaded on to filaments already coated with graphite, in this study the loading order was reversed. Loading the sample followed by the graphite resulted in a more stable beam (1 × 10<small><sup>−11</sup></small>
A at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 309) with less fractionation. Loaded filaments were kept warm to retain complete dryness until placed in the mass spectrometer. The reproducibility (2<span class="italic">σ</span><small><sub>mean</sub></small>) of measured <small><sup>11</sup></small>B∶<small><sup>10</sup></small>B in SRM 951 (100 ng B) was ±0.006%, equivalent to an external uncertainty (2<span class="italic">σ</span>) of 0.024%. That small amounts of natural samples with low B contents could be measured reliably was demonstrated by the external reproducibility for natural samples of 0.011–0.016%. Although the method was suitable for analysis of as little as 50 ng B, 100 ng B was recommended as the optimum amount for static, positive ionization analysis. One of the problems associated with B analysis is the risk of B loss by volatilization during sample preparation. Whereas Deyhle followed the conventional procedure of adding mannitol to reduce B volatilization, Wang <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit299"><sup><span class="sup_ref">299</span></sup></a> developed a new procedure to avoid the need to add mannitol. Separation and purification of B was based on chromatography first on a boron-specific resin, from which B was eluted in HCl, and then on a mixed ion-exchange resin. The latter adsorbed all anions and cations except B, thereby removing HCl and ions eluted from the first column. In this way losses due to removal of HCl by evaporation could be avoided. Samples of 1–2 µg were loaded on to single tantalum filaments (already coated with graphite) and the <small><sup>11</sup></small>B∶<small><sup>10</sup></small>B ratio in CsBO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ions measured using a peak jumping procedure.

In order to get small, homogeneous spots on the tantalum filaments, samples (2 µg Cl in aqueous solution) were mixed with graphite (50 µg) prior to loading. Use of wide filaments (1.5 mm) gave slightly higher ion currents and easier control of the filament current than when standard filaments (0.76 mm wide) were used.

Derivatization with NaBEt<small><sub>4</sub></small> can be performed in the aqueous phase and is therefore simpler and quicker than the use of Grignard reagents. The method was optimized with respect to the derivatization and extraction conditions and gave linear calibration over the range 30–1000 ng l<small><sup>−1</sup></small>

Jochum <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit329"><sup><span class="sup_ref">329</span></sup></a> have reported improvements to their multiple ion counting (MIC) system, which consists of 20 separate channeltrons for simultaneous ion counting. A computer-controlled autospark system adjusted the position of the electrodes in the ion source by optimizing the total ion beam to be within set default values. The total ion beam could be held within about 10% for 30 min, an improvement by a factor of about 30 over manual adjustment. The autospark produced a uniform consumption of electrode material of about 40 ng s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This new system with modern control electronics is a marked advance over previous autospark systems, which were rarely effective. However, the MIC system had poor mass resolution and molecular interferences from major elements became significant. Mathematical corrections were applied
to the ultra-trace determination of Hf, Nb, Ta, Y and Zr in order to overcome the problem of isobaric interferences caused by molecular species of major elements. Total uncertainties in MIC-SSMS analysis ranged from 2–5% to 10% for concentrations &gt;0.3 µg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and in the ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range, respectively. The precision of about 1% for isotope ratio measurements using MIC-SSMS was more than a factor of three better than that of conventional SSMS analysis with photoplate detection. The LOD of 0.003–0.1 µg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> obtained by conventional analysis for Rb and heavier elements was improved by a factor of 2–10. New analytical data for a range of geological RM were presented with the suggestion that some reference values at low concentrations were too high.</span><h3 id="sect2973"><span class="b_heading">10.5 New methodologies</span></h3><span>Selected ion flow tube (SIFT) MS, reported in previous Updates, is unable to achieve the very high precursor ion rates (&gt;10<small><sup>6</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) required for some applications.

The upstream quadrupole mass filter of the SIFT-MS instrument was not used. Instead, a weak microwave discharge was created in a narrow glass tube that carries a fraction of the carrier gas (He) into the stainless steel flow tube, thereby creating a weak flowing afterglow. In every other way the two techniques were the same. Indeed, the one instrument could be operated in either SIFT or flowing afterglow modes, the latter being chosen when large primary ion signals were required.

The four parts of the instrument were an ion source, a linear ion trap, an ion guide and an electron multiplier. The principle of the technique is based on energy transfer from molecular ions to the laser-cooled ions through Coulomb collisions when the secular motion of the sample ions is excited. Sample and barium ions were created in the ion source section by electron ionization at 150 eV. The secular frequency of sample ions, proportional to the specific charge of the ion, was measured by detecting laser-induced fluorescence emitted by the laser-cooled ions as sample ions oscillated in the ac electric field. The absolute amount of the sample ions that contributed to the spectrum was measured using the electron multiplier, which was calibrated using crystallized laser-cooled barium ions as a standard amount
of trapped ions. Separation of the ion source from the ion trap section prevented coating of the surface of the ion trap with barium metal. High transfer efficiency was achieved using the ion guide placed between the ion trap and the electron multiplier. The absolute LOD of the method was estimated to be 3 ions.</p><h2 id="sect3001"><span class="a_heading">Glossary of terms</span></h2><span>AES: atomic emission spectrometry</span><p
