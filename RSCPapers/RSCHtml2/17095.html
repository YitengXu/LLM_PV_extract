roadmap for graphene, related two-dimensional crystals, and hybrid systems, targeting an evolution in technology, that might lead to impacts and benefits reaching into most areas of society. This roadmap was developed within the framework of the European Graphene Flagship and outlines the main targets and research areas as best understood at the start of this ambitious project. We provide an overview of the key aspects of graphene and related materials (GRMs), ranging from fundamental research challenges to a variety of applications in a large number of sectors, highlighting the steps necessary to take GRMs from a state of raw potential to a point where they might revolutionize multiple industries. We also define an extensive list of acronyms in an effort to standardize the nomenclature in this emerging field.</p></div><hr/>

      <span>The primary objective of this roadmap is to guide the community towards the development of products based on graphene, related two dimensional (2d) crystals and hybrid systems. For simplicity we will refer to this new materials platform as <span class="bold">g</span>raphene and <span class="bold">r</span>elated <span class="bold">m</span>aterials and use the acronym GRM. These have a combination of properties that could make them key enablers for many applications, generating new products that cannot (or may be difficult to) be obtained with current technologies or materials. The creation of new disruptive technologies based on GRMs is conditional to reaching a variety of objectives and overcoming several challenges throughout the value chain, ranging from materials to components and systems.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The main <span class="bold">scientific and technological objectives</span> are:</p>

      <p class="otherpara">Our science and technology roadmap (STR) outlines the principal routes to develop the GRM knowledge base and the means of production and development of new devices, with the final aim of integrating GRMs into systems. In the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) area, the STR focuses on technology that will enable new applications, such as the Morph concept<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1a</a>), which exploits the electrical, optical and mechanical properties of GRMs to realize new types of personal communicators. In the domain of physical communication, the STR targets several key technologies in energy production and storage, as well as new functional light-weight composites. These are to be integrated in transportation systems, such as new airplanes, buses, cars (as illustrated by the SmartForVision concept electric car,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a><a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1b</a>). The STR also considers areas such as Health and Energy. By exploiting the GRM's unique electrical and optical properties, the STR will highlight the directions towards the development of novel systems for information processing and communications.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">The present STR may not be fully complete, leaving out some of the most recent and rapidly evolving areas. We plan to present regular updates over the next 10 years to keep abreast with the latest developments in GRM science and technology. These include charge-based high speed electronic devices, as well as non-charge-based devices (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> spintronic devices) with novel functionalities. A key area is advanced methods to produce GRMs, combining structural functions with embedded electronics in an environmentally sustainable manner. The STR extends beyond mainstream ICT to incorporate novel sensor applications and composites that take advantage of the GRMs chemical, biological and mechanical properties. Beyond ICT, the STR reaches out to several related areas. Graphene's high electrical conductivity, <span class="italic">σ</span>, and large surface area per unit mass make it an interesting material for energy storage, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> in advanced batteries and supercapacitors. These could have a large impact on portable electronics and other key areas, such as electric cars. The prospect of rapidly chargeable lightweight batteries would give environmentally friendly transportation a push and advance the large scale implementation of electric cars as a key component in urban and suburban transport. Strong and lightweight composites would also allow us to build new cars, airplanes and other structures using less material and energy, and contribute directly to a more sustainable world, see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="sect3184"><span class="b_heading">1.1. Graphene-based disruptive technologies: overview</span></h3>
        <span>Technologies, and our economy in general, usually advance either by incremental developments (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> scaling the size and number of transistors on a chip) or by quantum leaps (transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor technologies). Disruptive technologies, behind such revolutions, are usually characterised by universal, versatile applications, which change many aspects of our lives simultaneously, penetrating every corner of our existence. In order to become disruptive, a new technology needs to offer not incremental, but orders of magnitude improvements. Moreover, the more universal the technology, the better chances it has for broad base success. This can be summarized by the “Lemma of New Technology”, proposed by Herbert Kroemer, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for basic work in ICT: <span class="italic">“The principal applications of any sufficiently new and innovative technology always have been – and will continue to be – applications <span class="bold">created</span> by that technology”</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> Graphene is no exception to this lemma. Does graphene have a chance to become the next disruptive technology? Can graphene be the material of the 21st century?</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In terms of its properties, it certainly has potential. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics already acknowledged the profound novelty of the physical properties that can be observed in graphene: different physics applies, compared with other electronic materials, such as common semiconductors. Consequently, a plethora of outstanding properties have arisen from this material. Many are unique and superior to those of other materials. More importantly, such combination of properties cannot be found in any other material or material system. So, it is not a question of if, but a question of how many applications will graphene be used for, and how pervasive will it become. There are indeed many examples of “wonder” materials that have not yet lived up to expectations, nor delivered the promised revolution, while more “ordinary” ones are now pervasively used. Are the properties of graphene so unique to overshadow the unavoidable inconveniences of switching to a new technology, a process usually accompanied by large research and development (R&amp;D) and capital investments? The advancing R&amp;D activity on GRMs has already shown a significant development aimed at making GRMs suitable for industrial applications.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The production of graphene is one striking example of rapid development, with progress from random generation of micro-flakes in the laboratory<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> to large-scale,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> roll-to-roll (R2R) processing of graphene sheets of sizes approaching the metre-scale<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">It is reasonable to expect a rapid clearing of further technological hurdles towards the development of a GRM-based industry in the coming years (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

Transparency–conductivity–elasticity can find use in flexible electronics, high mobility (<span class="italic">μ</span>)-ultimate thinness in efficient transistors for RF applications, while transparency–impermeability–conductivity can be exploited for transparent protective coatings. The list of such combinations is ever growing. The most important are probably those not yet explored, as they might lead to new applications.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">The surge in graphene research also paved the way for experiments on many other 2d crystals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> One can use similar strategies to graphene to get new materials by mechanical<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> and liquid phase exfoliation of LMs<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> or CVD. An alternative strategy to create new 2d crystals is to start with existing ones (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> graphene) and use them as atomic scaffolding for modification by chemical means (graphane<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> or fluorographene<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a>). The resulting pool of 2d crystals is huge, and covers a range of properties: from the most insulating to the best conductors, from the strongest to the softest. Suitable properties may be used depending on the targeted application. <span class="italic">E.g.</span>, to cover a range of various conductance properties (but keeping the strength) one might use combinations of graphene and fluorographene, the latter being insulating, but almost as strong as the former.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">For the long-term future, opportunities can be envisioned, combining conducting graphene with semiconducting and optically active 2d crystals, to create hybrid multilayer superstructures. If 2d crystals hold a wide variety of properties, the sandwiched structures of 2, 3, 4… layers of such materials can further offer longer term prospectives. By assembling 2d structures, one can engineer artificial 3d crystals, displaying tailored properties. Since such 2d based heterostructures<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit104"><sup><span class="sup_ref">104,105</span></sup></a> can be assembled with atomic precision and individual layers of very different identity can be combined together, the properties could in principle be tuned to fit any application. Furthermore, the functionality of those stacks is embedded in the design of such heterostructures.

      <p class="otherpara">Exploiting the full potential offered by the electronic and mechanical properties of GRMs in applications requires extensive fundamental studies. Graphene transistors and interconnects have an opportunity to complement and extend current Si technology. One route towards the use of graphene transistors for logic devices relies on creating a controllable band gap. The limited on/off current ratio (I<small><sub>ON</sub></small>/I<small><sub>OFF</sub></small>) may be resolved in new transistor designs, which exploit the modulation of the work function of graphene,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> or carrier injection from graphene into a fully-gapped semiconductor,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> by gaining control over vertical (rather than planar) transport through various barriers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit106"><sup><span class="sup_ref">106</span></sup></a> or using graphene as a gate, electrode, or interconnect.

        <span>Graphene's promise to complement or even replace semiconductors in micro- and nanoelectronics is determined by several factors. These include its 2d nature, enabling easy processing and direct control of the charge carriers, fast moving (quasi-relativistic) electronic excitations yielding a high <span class="italic">μ</span> (almost equal between electrons and holes) – both at RT and low <span class="italic">T</span>, and high <span class="italic">κ</span>. Graphene crystals have two well-established allotropes, single layer graphene (SLG), where charge carriers resemble relativistic Dirac particles,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> and bilayer graphene (BLG), where electrons also have some Dirac-like properties, but have a parabolic dispersion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> However, unlike SLG, where the absence of a gap is protected by the high symmetry of the honeycomb lattice, BLG is more versatile: a transverse electric field can open a gap<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126–128</span></sup></a> and its low-energy band structure can be qualitatively changed by strain.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> Each of these has advantages and disadvantages for a given application, and one has to learn how to control and exploit them to create functional devices.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Concerning <span class="italic">μ</span>, further research is needed to understand the effects of defects and charge inhomogeneities, as well as development of doping techniques. The influence of various dielectric substrates or overgrown insulators also needs further basic understanding in order to optimize device performance. Further studies of transport regimes and optoelectronic effects in gapped BLG are needed for FET applications. Considering the possible use of an electrically induced gap in BLGs for quantum dots (QDs) and engineered QDs-based circuits (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, for quantum information processing<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a>), a detailed understanding of the influence of disorder and Coulomb interaction on the <span class="italic">T</span> dependence of conductivity is required, including the nature of variable range hopping in gapped BLGs, which can be generically described by an exponential increase of resistance following <span class="italic">R</span> ∼ exp[(<span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>0</sub></small>/<span class="italic">T</span>)<small><sup><span class="italic">p</span></sup></small>] (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131">ref. 131</a>) with <span class="italic">T</span><small><sub>0</sub></small> a constant depending on the localization length and density of states, whereas the exponent is given by <span class="italic">p</span> = 1/2 for the Efros–Shklovskii mechanism<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> and <span class="italic">p</span> = 1/3 for the Mott hopping regime;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> the dominating regime depending on the material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit133"><sup><span class="sup_ref">133</span></sup></a></p>

This is already possible with UHV systems combining several sources of molecule deposition (sublimation, liquid-valve injection), with surfaces characterization techniques such as STM and X-ray and UV Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Several STM techniques are currently used: low temperature STS, Spin-polarized STM and Fourier-Transform Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy (STS), which can allow a local dispersion and surface Fermi measurement.

          <span>Despite the intensive software development, the computational cost of <span class="italic">ab initio</span> methods still remains very expensive. This originates from the complexity of electrons represented by wave functions, hence possessing an inner structure with widely variable properties compared to simple particles used in classical molecular dynamics. The requirement of self-consistency is only one consequence of the quantum nature, which slows down such methodology. Although many concepts exist to weaken this impact, there is a practical limitation to sizes of systems, at present ∼1–2 nm, treatable <span class="italic">ab initio</span>. This, however, is not the length scale on which one discusses functional materials (at least one-two orders of magnitude above).</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The characteristics and fundamental properties of interest for functional materials are co-defined on a larger length scale beyond the <span class="italic">ab initio</span> scope. This is because they are additionally influenced by other facts governing properties on such length scales, such as low concentration dopants, impurities or structural defects, or simply because the relevant structures may reach these dimensions themselves. Special attention has to be paid to the interfaces or interaction of layers in multilayer systems.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Multiscale modelling<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit497"><sup><span class="sup_ref">497</span></sup></a> is capable of bridging length scales. The concept is based on the observation that not all interactions must necessarily be treated within the first principles framework. This allows one to introduce a hierarchy of interactions, which might be founded either on very general considerations or just adapted and valid for the presently studied properties. Based on this, a hierarchy of levels of treatment may be introduced. The lowest (microscopic) level deals with the smallest objects at the highest accuracy. It can be identified with the full <span class="italic">ab initio</span> level. Multiscale modelling defines first the models on each level and second the interfaces for transferring relevant information to the respective upper (or even lower for feedback loop) level, where they are further processed. The advantage is that not all information available on the computationally heavy lower level enters the upper-level modelling, but only relevant condensed information, which is precisely where multiscale modelling benefits from. In addition, modelling of interactions on the upper macroscopic level replaces respective couplings on the more refined lower level. This allows one to reduce the work at the lower level by treating smaller parts (non-interacting subsystems) there. <span class="italic">E.g.</span>, a finite range impact on electrostatics and on electronic properties can be expected from impurities or dopants depending on the local surrounding of a host crystal. Additional long-range parts such as the Coulomb interaction might be separable and can be treated on the upper level. The information on local electronic properties can still be obtained with massively parallel <span class="italic">ab initio</span> methods using large supercells. On the other hand, the evolution of a system as a whole, composed of millions of atoms, including a certain distribution of such dopants, is unpredictable by <span class="italic">ab initio</span> methods when the whole system is included at the same level.

First, a microscopic picture of the atomic structure is necessary to access electronic properties. This can only be provided with state-of-the-art first principles simulations. These can be carried out using simple unit cells in clean systems. When considering crystal imperfections or dopants, larger supercells with few impurity atoms or defect sites are necessary.</p>

        <h3 id="sect4925"><span class="b_heading">3.8. Perspective</span></h3>
        <span>Research is necessary to explore the biological responses and the potential toxicity of GRMs looking at their interactions with living systems. This will allow better understanding of the differences between GRMs, eventually establishing a correlation of their impact on health and environment with their physico-chemical characteristics. These studies could guide the safe design, production and manufacturing of GRMs, minimizing health and environment risks. To date, only a few studies focus on the ecotoxicology and environmental impact of GRMs. It is imperative to broaden our knowledge in this area in order to better identify the potential effects in the short and long term. With the development of large-scale production and the arrival on the marketplace, it is essential to assess exposure in real conditions and fully understand the GRM life-cycle. Without this, any assessment of health risks due to occupational or environmental exposure will remain uncertain.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The activities on health and environment need to focus on a thorough exploration of the biological responses and the toxicity effects of GRMs by taking into consideration their physico-chemical properties and bio-nano-interactions. The variability between the samples is currently high. The toxicity of GRMs seems to be closely associated to their surface functionalization. In relation to surface characteristics, size is a second important parameter. Other key factors can be also associated to the toxicity of new nanomaterials, such as generation of reactive oxygen species, indirect toxicity because of adsorption of biomolecules or signalling from cells that accumulate nanoparticles to adjacent non-exposed cells (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> paracrine signalling<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit599"><sup><span class="sup_ref">599</span></sup></a> – a form of cell–cell communication in which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering the behaviour or differentiation of those cells), and physical toxicity associated with GRMs interaction with lipids (and other molecules) constituting cell membranes, tissues and organs. In addition, the study of cellular and tissue uptake as a function of GRM size and chemical functionalization is very important. Lateral dimensions of GRMs might affect the population of the receptors involved in the mechanisms of penetration dependent on energy (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> endocytosis, an energy dependent process by which cells absorb molecules or nanoparticles by engulfing them, or phagocytosis). If passive processes, as in CNTs,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit600"><sup><span class="sup_ref">600</span></sup></a> happen, it is necessary to understand how the 2d form affects membrane organization (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> membrane disruption or sliding between lipid bilayers).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit601"><sup><span class="sup_ref">601</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">At the environmental level, the impact on organisms widely used as natural biosensors, such as lichens, and on a certain number of aquatic species, or microorganisms, specifically sentinel species that can be affected once 2d crystals are released, need to be assessed. New living organism models need to be applied to investigate the water/sediment interface and terrestrial behaviour of 2d crystals. All these studies will offer a safer design, production and manufacturing of 2d crystals in order to minimize health and environment risks, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig37">Fig. 37</a>.</p>

The term “epitaxy” derives from Greek, the prefix epi means “over” or “upon” and taxis means “order” or “arrangement”. In 1928 Royer<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit765"><sup><span class="sup_ref">765</span></sup></a> used the term “epitaxy” referring to the “oriented growth of one substance on the crystal surface of a foreign substance”.

There are two general epitaxial growth processes depending on the substrate, homo- and hetero-epitaxy.

        <span>Chemical vapour deposition is a process widely used to deposit or grow thin films, crystalline or amorphous, from solid, liquid or gaseous precursors of many materials. CVD has been the workhorse for depositing materials used in semiconductor devices for decades.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit846"><sup><span class="sup_ref">846</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">The type of precursor is usually dictated by what is available, what yields the desired film, and what is cost-effective for the specific application. There are many different types of CVD processes: thermal, plasma enhanced (PECVD), cold wall, hot wall, reactive, and many more. Again, the type depends on the available precursors, the material quality, the thickness, and the structure needed; cost is also an essential part of selecting a specific process.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The main difference in the CVD equipment for the different precursor types is the gas delivery system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit847"><sup><span class="sup_ref">847</span></sup></a> In the case of solid precursors, the solid can be either vaporized and then transported to the deposition chamber,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit847"><sup><span class="sup_ref">847</span></sup></a> or dissolved using an appropriate solvent,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit847"><sup><span class="sup_ref">847</span></sup></a> delivered to a vaporizer,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit847"><sup><span class="sup_ref">847</span></sup></a> and then transported to the deposition chamber.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit847"><sup><span class="sup_ref">847</span></sup></a> The transport of the precursor can also be aided by a carrier gas.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit847"><sup><span class="sup_ref">847</span></sup></a> Depending on the desired deposition temperature, precursor reactivity, or desired growth rate, it may be necessary to introduce an external energy source to aid precursor decomposition.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One of the most common and inexpensive production methods is PECVD. The creation of plasma of the reacting gaseous precursors allows deposition at lower <span class="italic">T</span> with respect to thermal CVD. However, since plasma can damage the growing material, one needs to design the equipment and select process regimes that minimize this damage. The details of the growth process are usually complex, and in many cases not all of the reactions are well understood. There are many different ways to perform plasma assisted CVD (see <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit848">ref. 848</a> for an overview). It is however important to match the equipment design with the material one is trying to deposit and the precursor chemistry. Graphene should be simpler than multi-component systems, since it is a single element material. As with many other materials, graphene growth can be performed using a wide variety of precursors, liquids, gases, solids, growth chamber designs, thermal-CVD or PECVD, over a wide range of chamber pressures and substrate <span class="italic">T</span>.</p>

Indeed, as the device size is pushed down, the dopant distribution needs to be precisely tuned, which is very difficult to achieve by post-treatment of large area graphene, such as hydrogenation or fluorination (or even doping during thin film growth). Precise and tailored dopant distribution may be assured by means of a hetero- (dopant) atom that is readily part of the precursor molecule. The effect of local doping needs to be investigated.

        <h3 id="sect6963"><span class="b_heading">4.13. Graphene and other 2d crystal hybrids</span></h3>
        <span>Technological progress is determined, to a great extent, by developments in material science. The most surprising breakthroughs are attained when a new type of material, or new combinations of known materials, with different dimensionality and functionality, are created. Well-known examples are the transition from 3d semiconducting structures based on Ge and Si to 2d semiconducting heterostructures, nowadays the leading platform for microelectronics. Ultimately, the limits and boundaries of certain applications are given by the very properties of the materials naturally available to us. Thus, the band-gap of Si dictates the voltages used in computers, and the Young's modulus of steel determines the size of the construction beams. Heterostructures based on 2d crystals will decouple the performance of particular devices from the properties of naturally available materials. 2d crystals have a number of exciting properties, often unique and very different from those of their 3d counterparts. However, it is the combinations of such 2d crystals in 3d stacks that offer vast opportunities in designing the functionalities of such heterostructures. One can combine conductive, insulating, probably superconducting and magnetic 2d crystals in one stack with atomic precision, fine-tuning the performance of the resulting material. Furthermore, the functionality of such stacks is “embedded” in the design of such heterostructures.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Heterostructures have already played a crucial role in technology, giving us semiconductor lasers and high <span class="italic">μ</span> FETs. However, thus far the choice of materials has been limited to those which can be grown (typically by MBE) one on top of another, thus limiting the types of structures which can be prepared. Instead, 2d crystals of very different nature can be combined in one stack with atomic precision, offering unprecedented control on the properties and functionalities of the resulting 2d-based heterostructures. 2d crystals with very different properties can be combined in one 3d structure, producing novel, multi-functional materials. Most importantly, the functionality of such heterostructures will not simply be given by the combined properties of the individual layers. Interactions and transport between the layers allow one to go beyond simple incremental improvements in performance and create a truly “quantum leap” in functionality. By carefully choosing and arranging the individual components one can tune the parameters, creating materials with tailored properties, or “materials on demand”. Following this novel approach, part of the functionality is brought to the level of the design of the material itself.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Inorganic LMs can be exploited for the realization of heterostructures with graphene, to modulate/change the electronic properties, thus creating “materials on demand”: hybrid superstructures, with properties not existing in nature,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99,106,1070,1078</span></sup></a> tailored for novel applications. <span class="italic">E.g.</span>, superstructures like those in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a> (SLG/BN/MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>/BN/SLG) can be used for tunnel devices, such as diodes, FETs, and light emitting devices, or for energy application, such as photovoltaic cells.</p>

        <h3 id="sect7155"><span class="b_heading">4.15. Outlook and future challenges</span></h3>
        <span>The successful use of GRMs depends not only on the identification of the right products for new and current applications, but also on the ability to produce any of the materials in large quantities at a reasonable cost. We now know over 600 LMs exist, and probably more. The progress in developing new materials processes over the past few years has been impressive.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">However, the suitability of any given process depends on the application. Nanoelectronics more than likely has the most demanding requirements, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> low defect density single crystals. Other applications, such as biosensors, may require defective graphene, while printable electronics can tolerate lower quality, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> lower <span class="italic">μ</span>, graphene. CVD techniques are emerging as ideal for large area graphene films for touch screen displays and other large display applications, while graphene derived from SiC maybe better suited for resistor standards. Many issues still remain to be addressed in the growth of graphene by CVD to improve the electrical and optical characteristics, including mechanical distortions, stable doping, and the development of reliable low cost transfer techniques. While transfer techniques can be developed to place graphene onto insulating substrates, it is desirables to grow graphene directly on dielectric surfaces for many device applications and progress is being made in achieving films on h-BN as well as SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. However, a lot more effort is required to achieve large area uniform high quality graphene films on dielectrics. In the case of graphene on SiC, among other issues related to uniformity, crystal size could be an impediment for large scale production. LPE is appealing for inks, thin films and composites, and future research is needed to control on-demand N, flake thickness and lateral size, as well as rheological properties. Synthetic graphenes, together with GNR produced by SiC,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> are promising for the production of atomically precise NRs and QDs to overcome the lack of band gap necessary for many electronic device applications. A controlled dopant distribution is also needed, and techniques such as functionalization using self-assembled acceptor/donor molecules or assembling pre-doped molecules are being studied.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The layered nature of graphite makes its integration with other LMs a natural way to create heterostructures. LMs have been around for a long time and studied and developed mostly for their tribological properties. Now these materials are being considered as new interlayer dielectrics for heterostructures with potential for new electronic devices with exotic properties. Because of this, there will be a host of new processes that will need to be developed in order to grow or deposit high quality large area monolayer films integrated with graphene with controlled thickness and transport properties.</p>

        <h3 id="sect7725"><span class="b_heading">5.3. High frequency electronics</span></h3>
        <span>High frequency electronics is a cornerstone of today's high-tech economy. The continuous downsizing of components in ICT sustained the electronics industry for more than three decades. This field was first dominated by defence applications, until the late 1980s, and then it moved into the mainstream in the 1990s owing to advances in wireless communications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1190"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1190</span></sup></a> Not only because miniaturization reaches fundamental physical limits, not solvable with conventional Si technology, but also because emerging applications, such as THz-spectroscopy,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1191</span></sup></a> require higher and higher frequencies, hardly achievable with established technology platforms.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Thus, a radical new approach is needed. Graphene as material platform for both digital and analogue electronics might overcome many obstacles: scaling beyond the Si limits is possible because graphene is ultimately thin and the high <span class="italic">μ</span> allows transistors to operate at frequencies beyond 1 THz.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The first entry points in electronics industry for graphene may be in analogue high frequency electronics, as there the advantages are most distinct in comparison with established technologies. Graphene may allow higher operation frequencies for frequency doubling and mixer applications than Si or Si/Ge, avoiding disadvantages of III/V materials, such as production costs, toxicity and poor integrability into a cost efficient Si technology.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition, ambipolar devices can significantly reduce the number of transistors needed in these applications. Simpler circuits mean less power consumption and smaller chip area. Considering that RF circuits are much less complex than digital logic ones, makers of RF chips are more open to new device concepts. Indeed, a large variety of different transistor and materials are today used in RF electronics, such as Si n-channel MOSFETs, HEMTs based on III–V semiconductors (GaAs;InP), and various bipolar transistors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1192</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Graphene transistors with a 240 nm gate length operating at frequencies up to 100 GHz were demonstrated in early 2010.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit788"><sup><span class="sup_ref">788</span></sup></a> This cut-off frequency is already higher than those achieved with the best Si MOSFET having similar gate lengths.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit788"><sup><span class="sup_ref">788,433</span></sup></a> Cut-off frequencies over 300 GHz were reported with graphene transistors with a 140 nm gate length, comparable with the very top HEMTs transistors with similar gate lengths.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1197"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1197</span></sup></a> More recently, a cut-off frequency of 427 GHz was extracted for a 67 nm channel length graphene transistor,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1198"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1198</span></sup></a> see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig62">Fig. 62</a>. These results are impressive, comparing the young age of graphene with the longer timescales of other devices. This is also a clear indication that GFETs have the potential to pass the THz-border in the near future. Thus, graphene may offer a cost efficient platform for novel applications in a variety of fields, such spectroscopy or automotive radar in analogue high frequency electronics. Significant impact in analogue RF communication electronics in areas as diverse as low noise amplifiers, frequency multipliers, mixers and oscillators could be achieved within the next 10 years, see the timeline in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig67">Fig. 67</a>.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Research efforts will not only be required for the optimization of graphene-based devices, but also for the development of circuit designs that can fully exploit the unique properties of graphene-based devices. The absence of a band-gap, therewith the un-incisive current saturation, the ambipolarity and the targeted operation frequencies going beyond 100 GHz require new concepts on system level and circuit design, which could also open the door towards novel functionalities. Thus, to take advantage of the full potential of graphene devices, the aim is to combine more basic research with improved material growth and device technology. A better understanding of parameters such as breakdown voltage, electron velocity, and saturation current is needed to allow a complete benchmark of this material and an evaluation of its potential performance.

          <span>The main building block of analogue electronics is a voltage amplifier: an electronic device capable of amplifying small AC voltage signals.

The use of GFETs in analogue electronics is currently limited to niche applications, such as analogue mixers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1199"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1199</span></sup></a> but even these require voltage amplifiers for signal processing.

In order to further increase <span class="italic">A</span><small><sub>v</sub></small>, FETs should be fabricated from wafer-scale BLGs.

In fact, they can be beneficial, enabling ultra-wideband accessibility provided by the linear electronic dispersion, allowing efficient, gate controllable, e–h pair generation at all wavelengths, unlike any other semiconductor.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Based on these unique optoelectronic properties, a wide range of applications can be developed. Here, we summarize a selection of those for which we see technological breakthroughs in the near-future:</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Highly-integrated graphene photonics.</span> The compatibility of graphene with standard CMOS processes at wafer scale makes it a promising candidate for high data-rate (inter- and intra-chip) optical interconnects. Graphene might allow the realization of high-speed, compact-footprint electro-optical modulators, switches and PDs, integrated with Si waveguides or plasmonic circuits. The mechanical flexibility of graphene may also enable the integration with bendable substrates and plastic waveguides.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Long-wavelength light detection.</span> Graphene enables light detection at wavelengths beyond the current limit set by the band gap of traditional semiconductors, opens up new applications in the FIR (THz) and SWIR and MIR regimes (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> bolometers and cameras), and has potential for ultrafast pixelated detection with ballistic transport of generated charge carriers.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Terahertz operation.</span> This will enable products such as portable sensors for remote detection of dangerous agents, environmental monitoring or wireless communication links with transmission rates above 100 Gbit s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">High-efficiency photodetection.</span> The target is the realization of highly efficient photocurrent generation by providing a gain mechanism where multiple charge carriers are created from one incident photon.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Plasmonics and metamaterials.</span> Graphene surface plasmons as well as tailored metal nanostructures can be exploited to enhance and control the coupling between light and graphene. This will pave the way to ultra-fast optical switching, ultra-strong light-absorption, PVs, and single bio-molecule sensing.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Photonic integrated circuits.</span> The target is to develop active optoelectronic devices and co-integrate these with passive optical components, such as waveguides,(de-)multiplexers and filters. Device functionalities comprise the switching and routing of light at ultra-fast speeds and at nano-scale dimensions, converting broadband incident light into detectable electrical signals.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Lasers.</span> Exploiting the broadband saturable absorption properties of graphene, the aim is to realize mode-locked lasers (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, fiber, semiconductor, waveguide and solid state lasers) with broad tunability and bandwidth in the telecommunications and mid-IR range, compared to existing technologies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The vision is to establish a new field of GRM photonics, sustained by the convergence and co-integration of GRM-based electronic and photonic components such as lasers, optical waveguides, cavities, modulators, photodetectors, and solar cells.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">GRMs may be employed as active optoelectronic materials to achieve light–matter interaction, convert incident light energy into detectable electrical signals, and, <span class="italic">vice versa</span>, electrical signals may be used to modulate light and realize optical switches. For this purpose, GRMs should be integrated with established and mature technologies, such as dielectric (Si or plastic) waveguides, optical antennas, plasmonic structures (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> gratings or nanoparticles), metamaterials, QDs, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Graphene's constant optical absorption over a spectral range covering the THz to the UV allows light detection over a wavelength range superior to any other material. Combined with its high <span class="italic">μ</span> and Fermi velocity, this implies that devices operating in the hundreds of GHz range are feasible.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Despite graphene's absorption of 2.3% being large once its monoatomic thickness is considered, it is still necessary to increase this value to allow more efficient light–matter interaction and realize highly efficient optoelectronic devices. For this purpose, several routes can be pursued. One is the combination of graphene with plasmonic nanostructures,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit446"><sup><span class="sup_ref">446</span></sup></a> whereby the near-field enhancement due to localized surface plasmons can significantly increase the light absorption.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit446"><sup><span class="sup_ref">446</span></sup></a> In principle, structures can be designed to achieve 100% light absorption.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit446"><sup><span class="sup_ref">446</span></sup></a> Semiconducting nanoparticles of various shapes and forms can also be used to improve the quantum efficiency.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1315"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1315</span></sup></a> Light harvesting and concentration with these nanostructures into graphene leads to increased absorption and more efficient conversion of light into electrical signals, with an increase of quantum efficiency.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another concept involves the integration of graphene with highly confined optical waveguides, such as Si-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides, widely used in highly-integrated Si photonics. As light propagates along the waveguide, it is absorbed along the length of the propagation and 100% light absorption might be possible.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1316"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1316–1318</span></sup></a> Graphene may also be inserted between two mirrors to form microcavity-integrated optoelectronic devices.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1319"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1319</span></sup></a> The incident light is reflected by the top and bottom mirrors and passes through the graphene multiple times. At the resonance condition, constructive interference enhances the optical field in the cavity, leading to enhanced light–matter interaction and strong optical absorption.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The exploitation of plasmons in graphene itself is raising interest.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252,266,273,1320–1326</span></sup></a> The resulting strong light–matter interaction can be further utilized to enhance detector performance as well as to enable radically new light sensing concepts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The ever increasing demand for higher-bandwidth brings along the need for higher-bandwidth devices on the transmitting, as well as the receiving side, of the communications link. As large parts of the internet traffic are already transmitted optically, the need for high-speed modulators and photodetectors in the telecommunications wavelength range (1.3–1.55 μm) is ever more pressing. Moreover, optical interconnects are currently being introduced as a way to link computers to mobile devices, as well as ultra-high bandwidth links for inter- and even intra-chip communication. It was demonstrated that graphene photodetectors are capable of supporting bandwidths up to 262 GHz,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1327"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1327</span></sup></a> a huge value, but still far below the intrinsic limit, thus far estimated in the THz range.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1328"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1328</span></sup></a> The speed limit of graphene-based PDs needs to be established. Devices need to be optimized in terms of responsivity, by enhancement with plasmonics and quantum structures, as well as integrated into optical cavities and waveguides. Electro-optical modulators need to be realized and benchmarked in terms of speed and other parameters.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The FIR (THz) and MIR regions are fairly unexploited parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and especially light detection is difficult as the THz photon energy is below the thermal energy. However, many interesting applications can be thought of, due to the non-ionizing and low-energy characteristics of THz and MIR radiation. Ranging from medical applications, such as cancer diagnostics, to security, such as explosive detection, since all materials have characteristic fingerprints in the THz/MIR region, a very wide application range is feasible. Further, active devices working in the THz/MIR range are crucial to convert very high frequency signals (in particular, the THz/MIR part of the solar radiation spectrum) into DC voltage – a feature which could eventually lead to self-powered devices. Having zero-band gap, graphene offers huge potential to outperform all available semiconductor technologies in the THz and MIR range, to reach THz operation frequencies, and to enable future wireless THz systems.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Graphene-based sensing and imaging in the SWIR is another interesting area that lies at the heart of safety and security applications in civil and military surveillance, night vision applications, automotive vision systems for driver safety, food and pharmaceutical inspection and environmental monitoring, just to name a few. The SWIR region is so far based on the use of III–V single crystalline semiconductors for sensing. Imaging has curtailed their monolithic integration to CMOS read-out integrated circuits (ROIC) and focal plane arrays (FPAs).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1329"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1329</span></sup></a> This results in SWIR imaging sensors at a 3-order-of-magnitude greater cost compared to visible-wavelength Si-based ones,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1330"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1330</span></sup></a> and pixel resolution limited to ∼1 MP (mega pixel) range,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1330"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1330</span></sup></a> as opposed to tens of MPs offered by current CMOS imaging sensors.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The 2d nature of graphene makes it also feasible to use CMOS-compatible processing techniques with CVD grown large-area graphene, in order to achieve highly-integrated arrays consisting of numerous individual devices. This may allow the fabrication of pixelated graphene-based cameras working over an ultra-wide spectral range, enabling image capture from the visible to the more unexplored THz/MIR range. Potential application areas include medical, automotive and security, such as tissue imaging, driver supporting head-up displays, and explosive/biological species detection.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Current solar cell technologies use only a rather small part of the solar spectrum due to their intrinsic band gap limiting the maximum detectable wavelength.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1331"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1331</span></sup></a> The absence of a band-gap in graphene translates into the absence of this maximum detectable wavelength limit and, combined with its constant absorption, solar energy over a much wider spectral length might be converted to electricity. Solar cells based on graphene, as well as combined with plasmonic and quantum nanostructures, thus need to be explored.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Graphene can be combined with other nanostructures, taking advantage of the strong light absorption in QDs and the 2-dimensionality and high <span class="italic">μ</span>, to merge these materials into a hybrid system for photodetection with high sensitivity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1315"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1315</span></sup></a> Further, the integration with plasmonic metamaterials will enable a new class of optical switches for displays.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Surface enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) can in principle achieve signal enhancements of up to 10<small><sup>15</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1332"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1332</span></sup></a> Plasmonic nanostructures enhanced sensing may lead to detection limits on the single-molecule level. The near-field enhancement resulting from the combination of graphene with plasmonic nanostructures<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1333"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1333</span></sup></a> will increase the signal sufficiently.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1334"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1334</span></sup></a> Such structures will also benefit from graphene's compatibility with biological species. Combined with graphene's single-electron charge sensitivity, we expect this technology to become a new platform for medical applications, not only providing enhancement at the single-molecule sensing level, but also being bio-compatible.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Integration of graphene into a cheap, flexible sensing platform based on plastics must be explored. It is envisaged to integrate and merge the aforementioned medical and THz/MIR sensors with plastic electronics to achieve a sensing-platform for wearable electronics, as well as low-cost one-time use sensors for use in developing countries.</p>

GSAs have potential for polarization-maintaining fiber lasers.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Fiber lasers and other alignment-free waveguide based lasers can offer excellent beam quality even when operated at high average power, because of reduced thermal effects.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1427"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1427</span></sup></a> In addition, they are compatible with fiber delivery, which offers flexibility in system design and use.

GSAs are interesting for this type of fiber lasers, as they can further decrease the fabrication costs and reduce system complexity compared to traditional SA technologies (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> SESAMs).</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In order to increase the damage threshold, graphene-based optical limiters need to be developed on two fronts.

          <p class="otherpara">One target is to increase the light absorption of graphene, and address the difficulty of extracting photoelectrons (only a small area of the p–n junction contributes to current generation), as well as addressing the absence of a photocurrent for the condition of uniform flood illumination on both contacts of the device.

          <p class="otherpara">Nanostructures with geometries resonant at desired wavelengths need to be investigated for selective amplification, potentially allowing light filtering and detection, as well as polarization determination in a single device at high frequencies. The frequency performance can even be improved in comparison with traditional devices, as the plasmonic structures add only negligible contribution to the capacitance (fractions of fFs), but can significantly reduce contact resistance. Further optimization (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, making use of coupled or cascaded plasmon resonances<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1481"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1481,1482</span></sup></a>) could increase the photovoltage enhancement.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The advances in the fabrication of sandwich structures can help elucidate the process of light absorption and charge separation in vertical stacks, optimizing efficient light conversion into electricity.

          <p class="otherpara">The low optical absorption and the narrow photocurrent generation region do not impose serious restrictions on the usability of graphene for photodetection. A number of concepts can be pursued to overcome these issues, and responsivities comparable to those of semiconductor-based devices can be reached. However, graphene's constant optical absorption over a broad spectral range allows light detection over a wavelength range superior to any other material.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The photothermoelectric effect, which exploits the conversion of photon energy into heat and then electric signal,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1428"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1428</span></sup></a> may play an important part in photocurrent generation in graphene devices.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1435"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1435,1476</span></sup></a> In particular, photocurrents assisted by hot-carriers are enhanced in the vicinity of pn-junctions leading to strongly enhanced responsivities.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1439"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1439</span></sup></a> The efficiency of hot-carrier generation depends on the competition of different relaxation pathways and can be greatly enhanced when photoexcited carriers do not lose energy as heat, but instead transfer their excess energy into the production of additional hot carriers or e–h pairs <span class="italic">via</span> carrier–carrier scattering. Pump-probe measurements have shown that in graphene the latter process is very efficient.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512,513,1464</span></sup></a> These results indicate that the production of secondary e–h pairs dominates the ultrafast energy relaxation of photoexcited carriers, prevailing over optical phonon emission in a wide range of photon wavelengths.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1464"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1464</span></sup></a> This leads to the production of secondary hot electrons, originating from the conduction band. As hot electrons in graphene can drive currents, multiple hot-carrier generation makes graphene promising for highly efficient broadband extraction of light energy into electronic degrees of freedom, enabling high-efficiency optoelectronic applications. Employing these unique properties, the development of novel designs for further optimization of thermoelectric light harvesting and detection may be possible. In particular, the efficient conversion from photons to hot carriers, a unique aspect of graphene due to the absence of a bandgap and strong carrier–carrier interactions, should be exploited.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another approach to increase the responsivity is to integrate a GPD a highly confined optical waveguide and increase the optical absorption, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig79">Fig. 79</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1316"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1316–1318</span></sup></a> NIR light is coupled to a Si waveguide, which is embedded in SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. A graphene sheet is located on top of the Si waveguide and there is a thin isolation oxide layer in-between. The fundamental TM (transverse magnetic) mode would get almost completely absorbed in the graphene, as the light propagates along the waveguide. The local field gradient at the metal/graphene interface drives a photocurrent towards the ground leads. The metal electrodes may also be replaced by poly-Si to reduce optical mode damping. The expected foot-print of such device is ∼30 μm<small><sup>2</sup></small>, comparable to state-of-the-art Ge PDs, nowadays used in highly-integrated Si photonics for on-chip interconnects. The simple device geometry, less complex processing and compatibility with Si technology could make graphene an alternative to other semiconductors such as Ge, even for large-scale integrated photonics. Apart from its superior physical properties, graphene's strength is its 2d character, which makes it compatible with standard semiconductor technology and allows for monolithic or hybrid integration with other materials. Graphene sheets can be transferred to arbitrary substrates (including flexible), etched into any shape, integrated with waveguides or cavities, electrically contacted, <span class="italic">etc</span>.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">All these aspects lead us to consider graphene as a promising new material for photonic integrated circuits,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1483"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1483</span></sup></a> particularly for high data-rate optical interconnects. Graphene will allow the realization of high-speed, compact-footprint PDs integrated with Si waveguides or plasmonic circuits. The mechanical flexibility of graphene may also enable the integration with bendable substrates and low-cost plastic waveguides. Photonic integrated circuits are based on the convergence and co-integration of passive optical components (waveguides, (de-)multiplexers, filters, <span class="italic">etc</span>.) with modulators, switches and PDs. State-of-the-art monolithic PDs are based on Ge or III–V semiconductors, but their responsivity ranges are spectrally limited. Graphene, without such a limit due to the gapless dispersion of the Dirac electrons, could thus pave the way for broadband photodetection, from the O-band (1260–1360 nm) to the U-band (1625–1675 nm), and beyond (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> 850 nm). The expected foot-prints of the devices are even smaller than those of state-of-the-art Ge devices used in Si photonics. The simple device geometry, less complex processing, compatibility with CMOS technology, and broadband and ultra-fast operation could make graphene an alternative to other materials, even for large-scale integrated photonics.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The 2d character of graphene and the possibility of large-area fabrication allows up-scaling from single devices into arrays.

First, commercial flexible electronics should be mechanically and electrically robust. Second, all used materials and components should meet essential performance criteria, such as low resistivity or transparency, even under mechanical deformation. Furthermore, materials should be environmentally acceptable. A full industrial and market adoption will also require that the platform allows integration of multiple technologies including active components. These requirements are impossible to combine with any existing high-throughput, low-cost mass-manufacturing solution. Graphene might lead to a flexible revolution, and graphene-based solutions might deliver benefits in terms of both cost advantage and uniqueness of attributes and performance.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">Reliable transfer of large-area graphene onto arbitrary substrates is a critical step in the use of CVD-grown graphene.

Dry transfer techniques have also been developed,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit602"><sup><span class="sup_ref">602</span></sup></a> but need to be optimized for different substrates and conditions. The presence of the substrate generally modifies graphene's electronic properties and thus it is important to optimize interactions between graphene and substrate. One way is the modification of the substrate surface by applying surface treatments. The question is how the bonding of graphene to the various substrates affects the electronic properties. The variations with the support can, in turn, provide additional control of the graphene properties. A deeper understanding of these phenomena should be achieved, in order to use these effects for tailoring the chemical reactivity of supported graphene. For many aforementioned applications, thermal expansion and conductivity are crucial and will need to be investigated and optimised. Moreover, the combination of graphene and related 2d crystals should lead to significant charge redistribution at the interface. Thus, tuning of different parameters such as <span class="italic">μ</span> and work function should be studied.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another approach is to develop processed LPE graphene deposited on a variety of flexible polymeric substrates to realize TCFs using an up-scalable, R2R coating, with the aim of achieving Tr ∼ 90–95%, with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sub>s</sub></small> &lt; 100 Ω □<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and tuneable work function.

Scanning probe microscopies as well as TEM are very suitable for investigation of selected regions with small to moderate areas, however, not practical for fast mapping of large areas.

          <span>Static and dynamic flexing pose interesting questions on how devices incorporated with different transparent films should perform in terms of various testing conditions, such as fatigue, torsion and repetitive bending cycles. One factor is also long-term stability of the material influenced under various environmental conditions. Si technology is rigid, but in recent years thinned down Si has been used to provide flexibility<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1798"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1798</span></sup></a> and reduce the strain in fabricated devices that can lead to failure. Graphene, mechanically unique due to its toughness, has very good static and dynamic flexible properties. Static and dynamic flex testing, such as three or four point bend testing to a particular radius (∼10 mm), can lead to fracture, but the characteristics of graphene provide unique advantages to overcome such challenges and should enable it to sustain cyclic fatigue testing up to a million cycles. Such characterisation will lead to industry standardization for manufacturers intending to integrate various GRMs for various applications, from touch panels to printed electronic applications.</span>

      <span>Storage and conversion are essential for energy production and saving. Energy can be stored in a variety of ways depending upon the intended use, with each method having its advantages and disadvantages. Batteries, capacitors, and fuel cells have been used and studied for over a century to store energy. The need to develop sustainable and renewable energy sources is leading society to develop energy from sources that are not continuously available, such as Sun and wind. In addition, there is a significant need to have portable energy not only for portable devices, but also for transportation, to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. Batteries and electrochemical capacitor storage devices are the most common means of storing energy, and fuel cells are also coming into their own. However, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed to improve their performance and their viability. Therefore, high energy electrodes are increasingly important.

Exfoliated TMO (or hybrids graphene-TMOs) are ultra-thin (capacitance and thickness of the electrodes are inversely proportional), conductive, with high dielectric constants.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The dielectric constant measures the extent to which a material concentrates electric flux. As it increases, the electric flux density increases. This enables objects of a given size, such as sets of metal plates, to hold their electric charge for long periods, and/or to hold large quantities of charge. Intercalation of ions between the assembled 2d flakes and within the thin layers could provide pseudo-capacitance. Moreover, the use of nanostructured thin layers of oxides in supercapacitor electrodes has the potential for enhanced volumetric capacitances (up to an order of magnitude higher than with the much less dense carbons currently used). The capacitance at an oxide electrode comprises both double layer and pseudocapacitance (Faradaic) contributions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1835"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1835</span></sup></a> Both specific surface area (SSA) of the electrode material, and the potential for charge transfer with possible intercalation/de-intercalation are relevant variables controllable by tailoring the TMOs.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">A major challenge is to bridge the performance gap between Li-ion batteries and EDLCs by developing technologies that can take advantage of both devices. Hybrid supercapacitors,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1910"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1910</span></sup></a> HSC, offer a solution to this problem by combining a capacitive electrode (power source) with a Li battery-like electrode (energy source). The present level of energy/power densities in HSC, as well as their safety, cyclic life and charging performance, are far below the levels required to power demanding systems. The aim is to address these challenges simultaneously by fabricating the next generation HSC based on graphene- core/metal oxide-shell nanostructured electrodes. The key step will be the alignment of graphene sheets to form a hierarchically layered structure on the microscopic level. Two strategies can be followed for the production of highly-aligned graphene sheets. The first can rely on MWCVD, while the second may involve layer by layer solution-based deposition. The vertically aligned graphene sheets would have several advantages over random dispersions: (1) much higher electrical and thermal conductivities; (2) larger surface area for interaction with the active material, Li ions and electrolytes; (3) better control of volume expansion, <span class="italic">etc</span>., all of which give rise to enhanced electrochemical properties and safe operation. The specific targets will be (a) precise synthesis and full characterisation of aligned graphene core/metal oxide shell architectures; (b) establishing correlations between the compositional, structural, electrical and ionic properties of core/shell electrodes; (c) developing high energy density, superior power capability and stable lifespan HSCs devices.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">For supercapacitors future investigations should also include activated GO, its surface is covered (or decorated) with chemicals, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> potassium hydroxide,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1887"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1887</span></sup></a> with controlled GO sheet curvature, controlled mesoporous electrodes combining GO sheets with CNTs, graphene-like structures with controlled and highly uniform pore sizes (TiC chlorination derived process). Upstream support activities need to focus on systematic exploration on how layer spacing affects capacitance.

        <p class="otherpara">This bioinspired route could be a fast vehicle for the incorporation of graphene in a range of industrial applications (aerospace, automotive, <span class="italic">etc</span>.), thus deserves further studies by a combination of modelling and experiments, taking into account the whole life-cycle of the materials, addressing issues such as graphene effects on composite processing (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> sintering, extrusion), novel properties and recycling/reusing opportunities.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">A crucial step will be the dispersion of the carbon nanofillers. A well dispersed state ensures a maximized reinforced surface area, which will affect the neighbouring polymer chains and, consequently, the properties of the whole matrix, see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig108">Fig. 108</a> and <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab9">Table 9</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="sect12937"><span class="a_heading">13. Conclusions</span></h2>
      <span>The field of graphene, related 2d crystals and hybrids is now rapidly evolving from pure science to technology. Different applications require GRMs with diverse properties, from structurally perfect and high <span class="italic">μ</span> graphene for high tech electronics, to defective materials for energy applications, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> batteries and supercapacitors.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The current and near future market for GRM applications is driven by the production strategies for these materials. Once each production route is mature enough, this will enable a widespread practical implementation of these materials. Thus, as summarized in the detailed roadmaps in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig122">Fig. 122</a>, the availability of a product for the end user is strictly dependent on the different pace of the material development. The cheapest GRMs and with the least stringent requirements could be the first available on the market, to be used, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, in flexible electronic devices based on conductive inks, such as flexible solar cells, batteries and supercapacitors, while devices which require the highest, electronic quality grade, such as spin valves, non-volatile memories, will take more time to progress.</p>
      <br/><div class="image_table"><table><tr><td colspan="3" class="imgHolder" id="imgfig122"><a href="/image/article/2015/NR/c4nr01600a/c4nr01600a-f122_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c4nr01600a-f122.tif" src="/image/article/2015/NR/c4nr01600a/c4nr01600a-f122.gif"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class="pushTitleRight"> </td><td class="image_title"><b>Fig. 122 </b> <span id="fig122"><span class="graphic_title">The STRs follow a hierarchical structure where the strategic level in a) is connected to the more detailed roadmap shown in b). These general roadmaps are the condensed form of the topical roadmaps presented in the previous sections, and give technological targets for key applications to become commercially competitive and the forecasts for when the targets are predicted to be met.</span></span></td><td class="pushTitleLeft"> </td></tr></table></div>
      <p class="otherpara">The target is to develop novel applications, planned thanks to each GRM unique properties, rather than try to replace other materials in existing applications. GRMs will replace existing standard materials only if the properties of the new components are amply competitive to justify the cost for changing current industrial processes.</p>
