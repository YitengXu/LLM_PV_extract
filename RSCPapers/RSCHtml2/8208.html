These changes are intended to more accurately reflect the current state of analytical research in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials. As a consequence, the title of the review and some of the section headings have been altered to reflect this. Significant areas of growth include the use of LIBS in remote analysis, especially of explosives and nuclear materials. The stand-off capability of the technique makes it very desirable in these areas. The use of chemometrics and procedures for removing substrate interferences are proving to be effective in making the technique more quantitative. It is also beginning to be reported for use in Process Analysis in the pharmaceuticals industry and has been employed to investigate the processes occurring within an engine and to model the processes occurring in explosions. The analysis of archaeological, cultural heritage and art objects continues to be a significant area of research, with some interesting developments in multi-analytical techniques which are employed to yield maximum information with as little disruption to the object as possible. Similarly, the high resolution capabilities of synchrotron radiation are being increasingly employed for high value objects where the cost of the analysis is outweighed by the benefits. In the field of materials analysis, the development of techniques for investigating the growth of novel material structures is a significant activity, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, the nucleation of alpha Alumina <span class="italic">via</span> titania templates, studied using a range of techniques. Papers outlining advances in the use of asymmetric field flow fractionation with a multi-detection approach for the characterisation of particle size and size distribution are reviewed as is a comparison of hydrodynamic chromatography with AFFF. Papers dealing with single particle analysis are also reviewed. The catalyst section is shorter than in previous reviews and this reflects the fact that fewer new developments in analytical chemistry are being published. The emphasis is on advances in the analysis of catalyst materials. This is the latest review covering advances in atomic spectrometric measurements of metals, chemicals and materials. It follows on from last year's review<small><sup>1</sup></small> and should be read in conjunction with other reviews in the series.<small><sup>2–5</sup></small> This year will be the last time that Mike Hinds will write for the review. His contribution over many years has been very significant and greatly appreciated. We welcome John Marshall to the writing team.</p></div><hr/>
    
      
      <h2 id="sect500"><span class="a_heading">1. Metals</span></h2>
      <span>For all types of metals and alloys, <span class="italic">the most interesting contributions</span> continue to centre on solid sample analysis methods. There continues to be a large number of papers in which different combinations of spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic methods were applied to the problem of interest. The overall distribution of papers reviewed for the metals section (as percentage of papers received) by instrumental method was: atomic absorption 3%, optical emission 25% (LIBS included at 21%), mass spectrometry 9%, SIMS 8%, XRF 13%, and the use of multiple instrumental methods 40%. Papers that are fundamental in nature and/or focus on instrumental development were not cited. A number of papers were included in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a> which demonstrated a range of materials and/or analytes that were thought noteworthy.</span>

        <h3 id="sect604"><span class="b_heading">1.1. Ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>A large number of researchers have used <span class="italic">multiple spectroscopic methods along with other analytical methods</span> to study metals. The phases of three aluminium–iron–niobium alloys determined using XRD and subjected to electrochemical treatment for de-alloying were described in a paper by Drensler <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> The preferential dissolution of Fe was determined in the electrolyte using FAAS and confirmed using SEM-EDXRF analysis of the remaining alloy. This study showed that phases in the alloys depend on how the alloys were prepared and heat treated. The oxidation of Zr-doped iron–chromium–aluminium–ytterbium alloy thin walled heating elements was examined under a variety of experimental conditions using thermogravimetry, optical microscopy, SEM, TEM, sputtered neutrals mass spectrometry (SNMS) and GD-OES by Gopalakrishnan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> Increased emissivity of the alumina scales formed on the alloy can be obtained by suitable Zr-doping of the alloy. Mun <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> studied B segregation to austenite grain boundaries in low alloy steel, by a combination of SIMS and particle tracking autoradiography (PAT). The segregation was examined both during cooling and when the alloy was held at one temperature. The distribution of B indicated that the retardation effect of B on ferrite transformation was due to the cooling rate dependence of B segregation into the austenite grain boundaries during cooling. Another group, Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> also used SIMS and PAT to estimate the distribution of B in the coarse grained heat affected zone of low alloy steels. Steel containing 30 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> B showed high segregation of B even at low heat inputs whereas the opposite was observed when B concentration was lower at 10 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">The nano-structure and nano-chemical composition</span> of dissimilar weld joints between nickel-based alloy, Alloy 690, and low alloy steel were studied by using optical microscopy, SEM, TEM, SIMS, and 3D atom probe tomography as reported by Choi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> Examination of the weld root region revealed an unmixed zone in the nickel-based alloy, a fusion boundary and a heat affected zone in the low alloy steel. Small scale analysis of the low alloy steel indicated a non-homogeneous distribution of elements with higher Fe and lower concentrations of Cr, Mn and Ni. It was also observed that carbides precipitated near the fusion boundary. Kaciulis <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> examined the microstructure and microchemistry of nickel-based super alloys with biphasic structure (gamma and gamma′ phases), using SEM, AFS, PIXE and scanning photoemission microscopy (SPEM). The compositional differences between the two phases were elucidated through SPEM spectral images. The development of the detrimental gamma′ phase in the alloy, was due to both external applied stress and to diffusion of W from the gamma to gamma′ phase. Rafique <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> synthesized 3D flower-like iron-cobalt alloy nanostructures and characterized them using a variety of instrumental methods. The iron-cobalt crystalline structure, with an average crystal size of 24 nm, was determined using XRD. The nearly equi-atomic composition (FeCo) was confirmed by using EDXRF and ICP-OES. It was also found that the flower-like structure was composed of six nano triangular prisms. The base and height dimensions that range between 100 and 200 nm were determined through the use of SEM and TEM.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A variety of methods are applicable to <span class="italic">examining metal coatings</span>. Itani <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> studied the properties of two types of zinc-chromium coatings on steel using XPS and scanning Auger electron spectroscopy. Specific regions of interest were examined: top surface, shallow subsurface and the whole bulk to the steel interface. Elemental composition was determined using XPS and compounds were identified by Auger electron spectrometry by comparison to reference samples and materials. It was observed that one type of coating was composed of metallic zinc and chromium with oxides residing only on the surface and interface. The other coating was composed mainly of zinc and chromium oxides. Thin coatings of titanium carbonitride on steel were studied by Miller <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> using Auger electron spectroscopy to confirm the composition of the coating. The chemical state of the elements in the coating was determined using XPS and the morphology of the coating was investigated using atomic force microscopy. In air, the coatings were oxidized but maintained their uniformity as indicated by TOF-SIMS. Mechanical tests were also done which compared the coating with the underlying steel substrate.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The study of <span class="italic">metal corrosion</span> has been a topic of interest during this review period. A selective, quantitative, and sensitive method for the determination of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in corrosion protection coatings for hard chrome coatings on copper or zinc electroplated steel surfaces was described by Novotnik <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> The Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> species was determined by ultrasonic extraction with an alkaline solution (pH 12), followed by anion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS.

        <span>As in the previous section, <span class="italic">multiple spectroscopic methods</span> are becoming increasingly important and a number of papers dealing with this area are reviewed. The morphology, element content, porosity and pore diameter distribution in foam aluminium were characterized using SEM, ICP-MS and a mercury injection apparatus as reported by Wang and Ren.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> Samples were observed to have uniform pore sizes and changes to the particle size of NaCl used in the manufacturing process resulted in similar changes to the foam aluminium pore sizes Oztoprak <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> investigated two copper plates welded together with stellite 6 powder (cobalt based alloy) using a millisecond pulse from a Nd:YAG laser. The composition of the weld and diffusion of the stellite 6 into the copper plates were followed using LIBS through depth profiling. Results from SEM-EDXRF showed that stellite 6 particles penetrate into the copper plates and mechanical tests indicated that this process increased hardness of the material. Holmberg <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> characterized the brightly coloured uniform passive layers formed on zirconium by electrochemical treatments using many different methods. Profilometry and AFS were used to examine the surface roughness and surface morphology. Electron backscattering diffraction and SEM measurements showed that the passive coloured layers were uniform and crystalline. The corrosion products in 1% NaCl solutions were determined using ICP-MS. There was little corrosion when the samples were polished, whereas etched samples showed substantially more corrosion. The effect of solidification parameters on the microstructure of antimony–bismuth–zinc lead-free solder was described by Cadirli <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> who used XRF to determine the composition of the microstructure. The phases of the microstructure were identified through the use of XRD. The combination of XRF and XRD was also applied to the analysis of nano-carbide transformation on used 2.25Cr–1Mo boiler tubes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> Measurements by XRD identified the carbide-phase components and an increase in the carbide phase, with tube age, was observed. A decrease in Mo concentration with ageing in the carbide phase region was determined using XRF.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The combination of <span class="italic">Raman spectroscopy and XRF</span> was used in three different applications. Sutter <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> studied the surfaces of a titanium–aluminium–vanadium alloy and tantalum after sliding across each other (at 34 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) using the techniques of Raman spectroscopy and XRF. The presence of Ti<small><sub>2</sub></small>O in anatase form confirms a rapid and a very localized rise in temperature on the friction surface. There was also evidence of titanium alloy transferring material onto the surface of tantalum (less than 10 μm thickness) despite the high sliding velocity. Surface roughness was also studied using a profilometer. The second application, by Petrova <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a> examined the gemstones and noble metals in a sceptre. A handheld Raman spectrometer was used to confirm types of gemstones attached to the sceptre. The presence of silver alloys and gilding were identified by a handheld XRF spectrometer. The silver values from semiquantitative analysis were confirmed by hallmarks and newly discovered documentation. The authors concluded that the combination of Raman and XRF handheld spectrometers is an ideal tool for studying historical artefacts where <span class="italic">in situ</span> investigations are necessary. Colomban <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> also used <span class="italic">portable Raman and a hand held XRF</span> instrument to analyse Asian bronze and brass pieces <span class="italic">in situ</span> at a museum.

The following compounds were identified in the patina: CuO, Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>S, tin oxides, ZnO, Cu<small><sub>3</sub></small>(OH)<small><sub>4</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, Cu<small><sub>4</sub></small>(OH)<small><sub>6</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, 3PbOPbSO<small><sub>4</sub></small>·H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, PbSO<small><sub>4</sub></small>/PbO, Pb(AsO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small>Cl and HgO/HgS. It is interesting to note that although worldwide sales of hand held XRF spectrometers have been quite high (reviewer's informal discussions with XRF vendors), there were relatively few reports in the literature in this review period related to the use of these portable instruments.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">surface characteristics titanium sandblasted</span> with zirconia particles were compared with the surface effects using conventional alumina particles in order to improve osseointegration for <span class="italic">titanium bone implants</span>.

However, the alumina particles generated a rougher surface than zirconia particles under the same experimental conditions. Overall, the authors concluded that zirconia particles were preferred over alumina because zirconia is more biocompatible than alumina, fewer zirconia particles remain on the surface after sandblasting, and sufficient surface roughness was obtained for osseointegration.

        <p class="otherpara">Multiple methods were also applied to <span class="italic">metal art objects and metal archaeological pieces</span>. The surface structure of a silver coin, manufactured in the Japanese Edo period, was studied using XRD, EDXRF, electron diffraction, SEM and TEM as described in a paper by Taguchi and Kirino.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> Results obtained using EDXRF showed a composition of 13% Ag and 87% Cu. However, reflectance spectra did not show evidence of Cu. Polishing some coins revealed that the coins changed to a copper colour and reflectance spectra showed the presence of Cu. The microstructure analysed using TEM showed that a related silver coin had two surface layers: a 0.6 μm Ag rich layer over top of a 0.8 μm thick layer of Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>O.

There was a remarkable connection between the quality of the silver and some crucial contemporary events.

Small cross sections of the coins were cut, embedded in plastic and analysed using SR-μXRF and μPIXE. The silver content ranged between 90% and 95%. These measurements did not agree with the historical interpretations which predicted a debasement of approximately 44% of the silver content in the coins. This might have been a very well preserved batch of coins and, therefore, did not represent the general population of these silver coins.</p>

          <span>Several different techniques have been used for the analysis of these materials. Two applications have utilized LIBS to investigate the processes occurring within a flame or an engine. A paper by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57</span></sup></a> described the use of LIBS to quantify local equivalence ratios of kerosene–air mixtures at elevated pressure in a high temperature test cell that simulates supersonic combustion. A Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm and an energy of 120 mJ was used to excite the materials and the H/O and H/N emission signals and equivalence ratio were measured at different gas pressures. In addition, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H-alpha line was also measured at different pressures. It increased in proportion with the pressure. The instrumentation used enabled the temperature to be monitored from room temperature to 350 °C and the pressure from 1–4 atmospheres. The detection system comprised collection optics, a fibre optic, a low resolution spectrometer (0.125 nm resolution at 500 nm) that covered the wavelength region of 200–850 nm and an intensified CCD camera. The system developed was used successfully to obtain the data required online. A second paper to utilize LIBS was prepared by Buschbeck <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit58"><sup><span class="sup_ref">58</span></sup></a> who determined local lambda values (the normalized air—fuel mass ratio) in a single cylinder direct injection engine and also the ignition location lambda. A Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm in the nanosecond region yielded a laser spot about 10 μm in diameter. Initially, the detection system was relatively simple with a cold mirror, bandpass filters and two photomultiplier tubes being used to detect light from H at 656.2 nm and from O at 777 nm. However, this was later replaced with a Czerny-Turner monochromator and an intensified CCD camera. The LIBS data collected enabled variations of ignition location lambda for different fuel injection strategies as well as correlations between variations ignition location lambda and the combustion dynamics to be calculated. Insufficient lean lambda values were the source of misfires in lean combustions. The study was extended to use both LIBS and LIF to obtain additional information on the two-dimensional lambda distribution. The instrumental setup was similar to that for the LIBS experiments, but a Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm was used to excite molecules into fluorescing at their most sensitive region, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> &lt;320 nm. The setup and operation were discussed at length in the paper.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Several other techniques have been used to analyse these materials and these will be discussed individually.

The flow batch analyser was used to prepare micro-emulsions of the materials in a surfactant (Triton X-100), water and an alcohol (propanol, heptanol, cyclohexanol, tert-butanol and isopropanol were all tested). In the study of gasoline samples, the Triton X-100 was diluted with tert-butanol whereas for the naphtha, propanol was used to dilute the emulsifying agent. Once prepared, the emulsions were delivered by the flow batch analyser to an autosampler cup of the ETAAS instrument and the analytes determined. The design and programme of the flow batch analyser as well as the temperature programme of the ETAAS instrument were presented. Since very high concentrations of Triton X-100 were used (between 25 and 75%), the solutions were very viscous. The authors, therefore, undertook a careful rheological evaluation to ensure that the individual components could be transported efficiently. Data obtained using the automated method of micro-emulsion formation were compared with those obtained manually and, according to a paired <span class="italic">t</span>-test, were in agreement. Recoveries were quantitative, with Pb in naphtha being recovered at 100.2 ± 3.4% and Cu and Cr in gasoline at 100.7 ± 4.6%.</p>

Optimal parameters for arsine generation were: 2.7 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> hydrochloric acid, 1.6% (w/v) sodium tetrahydroborate, a collection temperature of 250 °C for a time of 30 s.

Consequently, LOD of better than 7 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were obtained for analytes such as Mn, Si and V. Calibration was achieved using different volumes of a single xylene-based solution as a universal standard. Recoveries were in the range 95–106%.</p>

            <span class="italic">A review entitled “analytical methods for mercury analysis in coal and coal combustion by-products”</span> containing 115 references was prepared by Lopez-Anton <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> The review focussed on the specific characteristics of each of the sample types and the problems associated with their analysis. The methods used to achieve the analyses (both those under development and standard methods) were described, along with their associated advantages and disadvantages. The focus was mainly on the quality of the data produced and the uncertainties</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Recent progress in the use of <span class="italic">LIBS for monitoring coal quality and unburned carbon in fly ash</span> was summarized by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> Although described as a review, the references cited within the paper indicate that it is much more of a discussion of LIBS for assorted sample types. However, the recent progress in the area of interest in the authors' own laboratories were also summarized. A software-controlled LIBS system comprising a self-cleaning device for online coal quality monitoring in power plants was developed and discussed. The automated sampling device was capable of elemental analysis (where the analytes included Al, C, Ca, Fe, H, Mg, S, Si, Ti and organic O), as well as proximate analysis. This was made possible through the use of optimal data processing methods that were capable of correcting for both spectral interferences and matrix effects.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There have been several other <span class="italic">papers published that have utilized LIBS</span> to determine analytes in such materials. Included in this number is a paper by Yuan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a> who determined C in anthracite powders. The quantitative determination of C in anthracite powders has historically been difficult using LIBS because of the high measurement uncertainty. These authors bound the powder together using sodium silicate and then used the Si as an internal standard. This yielded data with better measurement precision and accuracy. A total of 15 anthracites were used for calibration and a further seven for validation. Using the optimal amount of binder, the precision was 12.1% RSD and the root mean square error of prediction was 6.25%. The same research group also determined C, H and N in 24 bituminous coal samples using LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> Argon and helium were compared as an ambient gas to prevent the ingress of nitrogen from the atmosphere and to enhance the emission signals. Partial least squares modelling was used to compare the different ambient gases. In general, the argon provided better precision through a decrease in signal fluctuation and a greater enhancement in sensitivity. The root mean square error of prediction for C concentration decreased from 4.25% in air to 3.49% in argon, whilst the average relative error decreased from 4.96 to 2.98%. Similar improvements were observed during H determination. The determination of N proved impossible. Although a distinct signal was observed using air as an ambient gas, it disappeared when argon was used which indicated that the signal arose from the N in the air rather than from the sample.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The final LIBS paper in this section was provided by Dong <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a> who also compared air, argon and helium at atmospheric pressure as ambient gas for the <span class="italic">determination of atomic and molecular C in coal</span>. These authors used a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm and with a power of 14 mJ and time resolved analysis to monitor the signal arising from C, <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>2</sub></small> and CN. Both the optical setup and the preparation methodology for the coal samples were described in the paper. Briefly, the powdered coal of 100 μm grain size was pressed using 25 tons into a pellet 5 mm thick and 31 mm in diameter. The laser was fired a total of 50 times per site and at four sites per pellet to ensure any statistical evaluation was valid. These authors also used atomic Fe emission lines to construct Boltzmann plots to determine plasma excitation temperature. Computer simulations of <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>2</sub></small> spectra were used to deduce molecular rotational temperature and the electron density and total atomic and molecular number density were reported to deduce emission differences between atomic and molecular C. The total molecular number and the reactions between plasma species and the ambient gas were the main factors affecting molecular C emission. The influence of laser energy on the rotational temperature in an air atmosphere was also studied and demonstrated that <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>2</sub></small> band emission could be utilized to correct for plasma fluctuations.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Other applications of coal analysis have also been reported. In one, by Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> the characterization of Hg in coals was undertaken using a <span class="italic">temperature-programmed decomposition with Hg detection using AFS</span>. Acid leaching followed by Hg detection was also used to assist in the characterization. In general, the content of organically-bound Hg was in the range 16–36% and was released in the temperature region of 220–600 °C. Silicate bound Hg constituted 10–26% of Hg and was released at temperatures greater than 600 °C. Pyrite-bound Hg was typically 5–44% of total Hg and was released between 250 and 630 °C. Finally, hydrochloric acid soluble Hg ranged between 10 and 34% and was released at lower temperatures. Six Chinese coals were used during the study.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have used ICP-OES as a means of detection after using different extraction techniques. Although the atomic spectrometry in both papers is not terribly novel, they do present viable methods of sample preparation and have therefore been included in the review. In one of these papers, Low and Zhang,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69</span></sup></a> optimized a <span class="italic">microwave extraction technique from coal and coal fly ash prior to the ICP-OES determination</span> of six major elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg and Na) and 12 trace elements. Seven reference samples including two coal certified materials (the South African Bureau of Standards material SARM 19 and NIST SRM 1632c) and three coal fly ash reference materials (SRM 1633c, SRM 2690 and BCR 38) were used during the optimization process. The recoveries of these elements in the different samples were tested as a function of the amount of hydrofluoric acid used (over the range 0–2 mL), microwave power (900 W or 1200 W) and sample mass (0.05 or 0.1 g). The amount of nitric acid (5 mL) and hydrogen peroxide (2 mL) remained constant throughout. The use of hydrofluoric acid was not necessary for the majority of elements in coal samples, the exceptions being K, Pb and V. In particular, the Pb extraction was noted as being highly sample specific and hence unpredictable. Conversely, the coal fly ash samples required the use of 0.1–0.2 mL hydrofluoric acid to obtain complete recovery. Even with the use of the hydrofluoric acid, the recovery of Al was never quantitative.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The other paper was prepared by Mujuru <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> who used <span class="italic">N</span>,<span class="italic">N</span>-dimethylformamide (DMF) and ultrasound to assist the <span class="italic">extraction of five trace elements from slurries of coal</span> samples. Coal (2 g) was placed in a plastic cup containing agate grinding elements and then DMF (5 mL) was added. After sealing the cup, it was placed in a micronizing mill for a period of 30 min. The coal slurry was placed in a 200 mL capacity volumetric flask, Triton X-100 was added as a dispersant and sufficient nitric acid added to give a final concentration of 2%. The flasks were placed in a sonic bath for 15 minutes to ensure good dispersion of particles. The slurry was then analysed using ICP-OES. Results obtained were compared with those obtained using a dry slurry technique. With this technique 2 g of coal were ground in the absence of DMF and then a 0.5 g aliquot placed in a 25 mL volumetric flask, and the Triton X-100 and nitric acid added. These slurries were also sonicated prior to analysis. To determine the amount of analyte extracted from the particles, aliquots of the slurries were passed through a 0.45 μm filter. The concentrations in the supernatant and the slurry could, therefore, be compared. Although there was some extraction in the absence of DMF, greater extraction was found in its presence. The proportions of the analytes extracted were very variable, with that for V being the lowest (17%) and that for Pb being the highest (100%). Studies using SEM indicated that partial dissolution of the slurry particles occurred. The procedure developed was applied to the analysis of three bituminous coal samples from different seams from South Africa.</p>

          <span>Sample preparation methods for subsequent determination of metals and non-metals in crude oils were reviewed (with 207 references) by Mello <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> The review combined text and easy reference tables to provide the necessary information and covered topics as diverse as acid decomposition methods (including the use of microwave technology), combustion bombs, simple dilution in organic solvents (the dilute and shoot approach), emulsification, and methods that can be used for speciation analysis. Also discussed were the direct analysis methods, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, ETAAS, XRF, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, which require little or no sample preparation. A useful addition to the review was a section that discussed available reference materials. The authors point out that unfortunately many of the reference materials are either diesels, petrol or wear oils. Many of them have certified values for S and a few for Ni and V. However, there are few materials that are certified for a suite of analytes.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Acid decomposition protocols are still popular for this sample type because ICP instrumentation “prefers” aqueous phase solvents to be aspirated. However, the conditions required for complete dissolution are usually very harsh. Ortega <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a><span class="italic">compared several different acid dissolution protocols</span> including three separate microwave digestion procedures (that used different temperatures and pressures), a microwave combustion method and a high temperature ashing method. The latter comprised putting crude oil (500 mg) in a quartz container, adding nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide and then heating to 320 °C in an autoclave. The paper gave the full experimental conditions for each of the protocols. As well as giving the relative recoveries obtained from the analysis of the certified material NIST SRM 1634c, the authors also commented on the quality of the blank solutions and on the time required per digestion. Although the microwave induced combustion was the most rapid, it did suffer from poor quality blanks. It also used a far higher temperature (1400 °C) than any of the other protocols. In general, recovery using the different protocols ranged from 80 to 120%, with one of the acid digestion procedures giving a consistently high recovery rate of between 91 and 105% for all of the analytes determined. Other protocols, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, the microwave induced combustion, were far more variable, with recoveries ranging from 84.4 to 119.9% depending on the analyte.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another paper to have compared different sample decomposition methods was prepared by Pontes <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> These authors compared three methodologies for the <span class="italic">preparation of crude oil and related products prior to the determination of total Hg using CV-AAS</span>. These three methodologies were: a closed-pressurized vessel, a cold finger digest collection system placed in an <span class="italic">aqua regia</span> heated digestion apparatus, and a pyrolysis system. The loss of sample through evaporation was determined for each of the methods, with the pyrolysis system suffering the worst loss rates, largely because it used the smallest mass of material (∼25 mg, compared with 0.25 g and 0.5 g for the high pressure asher and cold finger systems respectively). Methods designed to minimize these problems were investigated. Since the cold finger system was large and heavy, the sample could not be weighed directly into it. The authors, therefore, used gelatinous capsules, similar to those used in the pharmaceutical industry to enclose drugs, to contain the samples. Sample was simply weighed into one half of the capsule and was then enclosed using the other half, with the whole capsule being transferred into the digestion system. Despite the development of this weighing protocol, the authors stated that this method had the highest blank levels, the highest LOQ and the longest digestion time of all the methods tested. The pyrolysis system used only ∼25 mg of sample, since higher mass led to interference effects through the production of smoke, yielding recoveries of Hg between 63 and 180%. Placement of the sample on alumina powder within the pyrolysis chamber decreased evaporation losses significantly (by between 38 and 61%) and had the added bonus of facilitating the cleaning of the chamber after use. The LOD obtained depended on the method used for sample preparation but all were impressive, with values of 1.3, 8.6 and 3.3 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> being achieved for the high pressure ashing, cold finger and pyrolysis methods respectively. Precision was better than 14% RSD for all procedures.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A different approach to acid digestion was presented by Cinosi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> who described <span class="italic">atmospheric pressure, vapour phase decomposition</span> of high boiling petrochemical fractions and distillation bottoms. Sample was attacked by nitric acid vapours that had been heated to 100 °C and the digest analysed using TXRF. The LOD obtained were in the range of 10–100 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As, Bi, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn whereas they were higher (0.3–3 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) for Ba, Ca, K, P, Rh, Ti and V. The preparation procedure was rapid, lasting less than 30 minutes. The results were compared with those obtained using the standard ASTM D5708 method B, that requires the use of a sulfuric acid wet ash followed by a period in a muffle furnace to remove the carbonaceous residue and the uptake of the remaining residue using nitric acid prior to ICP-OES determination. The digestion protocol developed and reported in this paper was significantly faster, since the standard method takes typically a whole day. Results obtained using the two protocols were in reasonable agreement, with a regression coefficient of 0.92 being achieved. Precision values were also similar.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The determination of As and Se in crude oil using a <span class="italic">simple dilution in xylene</span> and analysis using ICP-MS was reported by de Albuquerque <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> The dynamic reaction cell was not required for the determination of As, since there was no visible interference on <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 75.

Results obtained using this simple “dilute and shoot” method were compared with those obtained using a nitric acid decomposition of the material in a hotblock followed by reduction using 6 M hydrochloric acid and analyte determination using HG-ICP-MS. The results were in good agreement. The reference method provided significantly lower LOD (0.002 and 0.0414 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As and Se, respectively) compared with the proposed method (0.04 and 0.1 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As and Se). However, it was much slower. Further method validation for the proposed method was achieved using certified reference materials. Despite its short-comings, the proposed method was deemed fit for purpose.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers by Ortega <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77,78</span></sup></a> discussed the <span class="italic">determination of Pb isotope ratios</span> in crude oils and related materials. In one,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> oil (0.5 g) was digested using hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid in a high pressure asher. Half of the digest was used to determine total Pb using ICP-MS and the other half underwent Pb isolation and purification using AG1-X8 resin prior to Pb ratios being measured using MC-ICP-MS. The protocol for this was described in detail. Poor recovery from the resin led the authors to optimize the amount of resin used, and at least 0.5 mL was optimal. Several mass bias correction procedures were evaluated and a combination of thallium normalization and standard bracketing was optimal. Precisions were 0.0039, 0.0014 and 0.0012% and accuracies (in parts per thousand) were 0.001, 0.001 and 0.004 for <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>204</sup></small>Pb, <small><sup>207</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>204</sup></small> and <small><sup>206</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>204</sup></small>Pb, respectively for the analysis of NIST SRM 981.

Again, thallium was used as a means of mass bias correction, being introduced as a liquid sample aspirated simultaneously to the eluent from the GC. Results obtained using the method were compared with those obtained using conventional continuous sample introduction.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">simple emulsion protocol</span> for the determination of Ba, Ca, Mg and Sr in crude oils using FAAS (for Ca, Mg and Sr) and ETAAS (for Ba) was described by Pessoa <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> The amount of sample required was dependent on the analyte, but was approximately 0.1 g, 0.25 g and 1 g for Mg, Ca and Sr respectively. Sample was diluted with 1 mL of toluene, sonicated using a sonic bath for five min and then Triton X-100 (100 mg) and potassium chloride (0.5 mL of 2%) added. Finally, the sample was diluted to 10 mL using 0.2% v/v nitric acid, shaken manually and replaced in the sonic bath for a further five minutes. Calibration standards were prepared in a similar way but using base oil and aqueous standards. The emulsions were stable for at least five days. Recoveries ranged from 96 to 104% and the results obtained from the analysis of the reference material NIST SRM 1085b were in good agreement with certified values.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">pressurized liquid extraction method</span> for the determination of Al, Cu, Mg, Pb, Sn and Ti in lubricating oils was developed by Carballo-Paradelo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> who used dilute HCl as extractant. A very specific order of loading the extraction cell was required and this was given in the paper. A Plackett-Burman experimental design was used to study the variables: pH of the aqueous extractant, mass of dispersing agent, mass of cleaner agent, temperature and time of the extraction cycle and the number of cycles. The most important of these variables was the pH, which had to be set at 0.5 using concentrated hydrochloric acid. Using ICP-MS as a means of detection, the recoveries obtained when a reference material (NIST SRM 1084a) was analysed ranged from 80 to 118%, although Ag was much poorer (typically ∼20%). The authors stated that the method had several advantages over other procedures because it dealt solely with aqueous extracting solutions, which means that calibration standards could also be aqueous-based. In addition, fewer interferences were observed because organic solvents were not introduced to the plasma.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A simple, direct method of determining As and Cd in crude oils was described by de Jesus <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a><span class="italic">Sample was weighed directly onto solid sampling platforms</span> and then analysed using ETAAS. A matrix modifier of 0.1% palladium, 0.06% magnesium and 0.06% Triton X-100 was suitable for both analytes and calibration was against aqueous calibrants. Under optimal conditions (ash and atomize curves were plotted for both aqueous standards and for the crude oil samples), detection limits were 5.1 and 0.2 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As and Cd respectively. As usual with direct solid sampling, precision was not particularly good, but was described as being better than 20% RSD. Method validation was achieved in two ways. For the As determination, the reference material NIST SRM 1634c was used. However, no suitable material was available for the Cd and so an alternative method was employed. This involved the open vessel digestion of the sample using a cold finger to achieve reflux. Using the paired <span class="italic">t</span>-test, the results obtained using this method were compared with those obtained using the solid sampling protocol and were not significantly different.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Pontes <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> determined Hg in crude oils and related products by developing an online system that utilized <span class="italic">a gold trap to preconcentrate the Hg vapour prior to determination using CV-AAS</span>. The preparation of the gold trap was described in detail as was the FI manifold that utilized numerous valves to inject sample, direct argon flow <span class="italic">etc.</span> The Hg was released from the samples using tin(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) chloride and the Hg was then trapped on a gold amalgamation trap. This was then heated to release the Hg so that it could be detected using a Zeeman effect CV-AAS instrument. The use of the Zeeman effect background correction system was described as being beneficial because it helped overcome interference effects caused by any organic vapours released from the trap. Numerous parameters were optimized including the amalgamation temperature, amalgamation time and the argon purge gas flow rate. Trapping at120 °C provided a sharper peak once the Hg was released than collection at room temperature, which provided a distorted, broad peak and led to over estimates of the analyte concentration (135% recovery). The release temperature was a compromise between the high temperatures required to avoid non-Gaussian shaped peaks and durability of the heating element of the trap. Above 600 °C, the nickel–chromium alloy heating element became brittle and snapped. A maximum of 600 °C was therefore employed. An amalgamation time of three minutes was sufficient to obtain complete recovery from 2.5 mL of crude oil spiked with 1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Hg. The LOD obtained was 0.06 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and precision was better than 10% RSD.

An internal standard of indium was used to correct for variation in the amount of sample ablated. Calibration was achieved using aqueous standards encapsulated in a xerogel in a similar fashion to the oils. Results for Ni, S and V obtained using this method were compared with those obtained using either direct introduction of the organic sample (in the case of Ni and V) or by a digestion (for S) and were similar.

Detection limits ranged from 5 to 20 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and precision was better than 2% RSD for all methodologies. The dilute and shoot approach was faster and far more simple than the other protocols and seemed not to have any drawbacks. It even enabled calibration using inorganic standards. Another paper to use a dilute and shoot approach was prepared by Caldas <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> who applied a four variable Doehlert design for the multivariate optimization of Cu determination using ETAAS in petroleum-derived insulating oils. The oil was diluted 1:1 with hexane and then injection (20 μL) into the ETAAS instrument. The Doehlert design optimized the drying, ash and atomization temperatures, the ash time and the heating ramp during the drying step. Under optimal conditions, the LOD achieved was 1.6 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the LOQ was 5.3 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Even though optimal conditions were used, the method of standard additions was required since interferences were not removed completely.

Calibration was achieved using a commercial organic-based, multi-elemental standard diluted in xylene. A specialist organic material introduction kit comprising a micro-nebulizer, a cryogenic chamber kept at 5 °C and a demountable torch with an injector with a bore of only 0.85 nm was used. A small flow of oxygen (0.1 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) was introduced between the outlet of the spray chamber and the torch to minimize the amount of carbon being deposited on the interface and ion lens system of the instrument. The chemometric optimization technique of Central Composite Design was used to optimize ICP operating parameters such as power and the nebulizer and auxiliary gas flows ensuring that doubly charged ion (Ba<small><sup>2+</sup></small>) and oxide-related (LaO<small><sup>+</sup></small>) interferences were minimized. The optimal conditions were: nebulizer gas flow rate of 0.42 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, auxiliary gas flow rate of 1.1 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a power of 1300 W.

The amount of methane required was not the same for all analytes, with Ca, Cr and Mg requiring 0.8 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and Fe requiring only 0.1 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Use of a methane flow rate higher than 0.1 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> actually increased interference effects exerted on the Fe signal. The work was validated using NIST SRM 1034c (residual fuel oil) and SRM 1085b (wear metals in lubricant oil) and was then applied to biodiesel samples that included cotton, sunflower, used frying oil, palm, pequi, soybean, animal fat and castor bean oil. A suite of analytes were determined, with most giving recoveries in the range 90–110% but with Mg giving a recovery of 119%.

          <p class="otherpara">As well as the paper by de Souza <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> (discussed above), two other papers have discussed methods of <span class="italic">minimizing interferences during ICP-MS analysis</span> of such materials. In one, by Donati <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89</span></sup></a> an interference standard and an oxide detection system were employed to determine P and S in different oil types. An interference standard is similar in concept to the use of a conventional internal standard, but instead of spiking the sample with indium or another analyte not present at significant quantity in the sample, it relies on a polyatomic interference or an argon species present in the plasma. On this occasion, the <small><sup>30</sup></small>Si<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small> was used in an attempt to maximize accuracy.

The procedure developed appeared to depend on the fact that Ti, which would provide several isobaric interferences at the mass to charge ratios being determined, is not a common contaminant of oils. Therefore, although the method appeared to work satisfactorily for the samples analysed, it may be completely inappropriate for many other sample types. The oils were prepared for analysis using a microwave oven assisted acid digestion protocol. Also included in this paper was the use of an interference standard to improve accuracy. The authors claim that it is efficient for most determinations, but inspection of some of the data included in the paper indicates that recovery varied from 62 to 196%. The same research group published a paper that determined several analytes in fuel ethanol.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit90"><sup><span class="sup_ref">90</span></sup></a> These authors tested the use of both hydrogen and helium as collision reaction interface gases in an attempt to maximize the efficiency of interference removal during ICP-MS analyses. Sample was diluted 20-fold and this was sufficient to prevent any carbonaceous build-up on the interface cones. A central composite design approach was used to optimize plasma power, sampling depth and nebulizer gas flow rate. Oxygen addition through the skimmer cone was more efficient in removing polyatomic interferences (<small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>12</sup></small>C<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>12</sup></small>C<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>, and <small><sup>12</sup></small>C<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> on <small><sup>52</sup></small>Cr<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>56</sup></small>Fe<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>24</sup></small>Mg<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>28</sup></small>Si<small><sup>+</sup></small> respectively) than addition <span class="italic">via</span> the auxiliary gas flow or the introduction of helium. Calibration was achieved using matrix matched, inorganic standards and Y was used as the internal standard. The protocol developed was applied to the determination of a suite of 16 analytes in fuel ethanol. Recoveries and precision ranged from 78 to 114% and 0.4 to 2%, respectively. The LOD obtained were better than 0.8 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for all analytes except for Si, which had a LOD of 14 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Since many analytes are present at quite low levels in fuels, <span class="italic">preconcentration techniques</span> are occasionally required so that determination can be achieved more reliably. Teixeira <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> adjusted the pH of ethanol fuel samples to between 5 and 7.5 by the addition of the minimum amount of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Aliquots of the sample (10 mL) were then passed through disks of P81 ion exchange cellulose chromatography papers that had been placed in polycarbonate filter holders. After drying, the papers were placed in an XRF sample cup and held in place by Mylar film. The papers were then analysed directly using EDXRF. Calibration was achieved by preparing standards in ethanol and passing these through filter papers in the same way as the samples. The analytes determined were Cu, Fe, Ni and Zn. Parameters such as flow rate through the filter and sample volume were optimized. Although 1 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was optimal (higher flow rates led to a significantly reduced signal for a 10 mL sample volume), a 2 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> flow rate was chosen as a compromise between sensitivity and sample throughput. A sample volume of 10 mL was adequate for the accurate determination of the analytes, although improved LOD could be obtained if higher sample volumes were used. This came at the cost of increased analysis time. Precision was approximately 3% RSD for all analytes and LOD were 13, 15, 15 and 12 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cu, Fe, Ni and Zn respectively. The data obtained were compared with those obtained using a standard ICP-OES technique and were in excellent agreement. Another preconcentration technique prior to an atomic spectrometric determination of analytes in fuel ethanol was reported by Cortez and Pasquini.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> These authors used a flow injection-like manifold to drip sample onto a filter paper that was placed inside a small heated circular oven (called a ring oven). The droplets diffused by capillary action through the paper before they completely evaporated and formed a circular area of approximately 2 cm diameter. This enabled preconcentration factors of approximately 250 to be achieved. The papers were then analysed directly using LIBS providing the analytes Cu, Fe and Na with LOD of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.7 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. Recoveries were 98 ± 12, 92 ± 18 and 109 ± 13% for the same analytes.

          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">flow blurring multi-nebulizer</span> that had three liquid sample channels and one gas inlet was used by Aguirre <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> to introduce biodiesel and oil samples to an ICP-OES instrument. The materials were analysed using an online standard additions protocol that utilized aqueous standards. Comparison was made with a commercially available nebulizer that used organic-based standards for conventional standard additions. Both nebulizers introduced sample at a rate of 100 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to a cyclonic-style spray chamber. For the analysis of a multi-elemental Conostan organic standard, the flow blurring multi-nebulizer provided data that were in agreement within ±3% of certified values. This was marginally better than those obtained using the commercial system, which agreed to within −5 to + 4%. Short term (1 minute) and long term (2 hours) precision of the two systems were assessed with the multi-nebulizer being more precise in the short term especially at lower concentration. The long term stability test demonstrated conclusively that the multi-nebulizer (precision values at several wavelengths being between 1.5 and 2% RSD) out-performed the commercial one (between 10 and 13% RSD). This was attributed to the commercial system having to introduce organic material continuously which led to gradual build-up of carbon on the tip of the injector. Since the multi-nebulizer used aqueous standards to form standard additions online, the organic content entering the plasma was effectively decreased. Consequently, carbon build-up was also decreased. Characterization of the primary aerosols produced by the two nebulizers indicated that the multi-nebulizer produced droplets of less than 33 μm in diameter, whereas the commercial one had a much coarser droplet distribution (less than 114 μm). Once optimized, the multi-nebulizer was applied to the analysis of biodiesel samples, with recovery data being close to 100% in all cases.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Da Silva <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> developed a method by which Hg in ethanol biofuel was determined using <span class="italic">photochemical vapour generation with AAS detection</span>.

The prepared sample was then pumped at a rate of 7 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> through a photochemical reactor comprising a tube, of dimensions 200 cm by 2 mm, surrounding a mercury lamp operating at 254 nm and 15 W. On emerging from the photochemical reactor, the sample entered a gas–liquid separator where the vapour was purged to AAS detection using an argon flow rate of 52 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The sample flow rate, concentration of the organic acids and purge gas flow rate were all optimized to give the highest Hg signal. Although some Hg is observed in the absence of the organic acids, the signals increased rapidly to the optimal values before starting to decrease again. This decrease in signal at higher concentrations of organic acids was attributed to them absorbing the UV light, hence decreasing the amount of light available to form the Hg vapour. Determination of single standards of methyl- and ethylmercury indicated that there was no significant sensitivity difference between them and inorganic mercury. The method developed was, therefore, capable of total Hg determination. Calibration standards were prepared using bi-distilled ethanol to matrix match the samples as closely as possible. Recoveries of the analytes from spiked solutions of bioethanol ranged from 97 to 101% for samples fortified with formic acid and from 98 to 103% for those with added acetic acid.

          <p class="otherpara">Alfeld <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> described how conventional imaging had revealed that a Rembrandt was painted on a re-used canvas and had covered the original image. However, the detail of this image could not be revealed. Vermillion (HgS) had previously been identified to have been used for the flesh tones of the lower, hidden painting, suggesting that element-specific XRF imaging may be useful to reveal the hidden image. Vermillion was used in a mock up of the overpainted image which was prepared for this work. XRF imaging of this mock painting was conducted using three different XRF imaging systems: a mobile X-ray tube based system and two synchrotron-based systems. The experimental set ups are shown in some very informative diagrams in the paper and the negative images of the scanned mock painting are presented. Images from the three systems were compared and, surprisingly, the X-ray tube based scanner gave better results than the synchrotron scanner for Ca imaging, as the lower sensitivity was compensated for by the longer dwell time per point with the mobile scanner. For the heavier elements (Hg and Pb), the synchrotron-based scanner was more than one hundred times more sensitive, permitting shorter acquisition times and smaller step sizes. This yielded much higher resolution and contrast. This work has provided supporting evidence that transporting the original Rembrandt to a synchrotron facility should be a useful activity to undertake.</p>

In another example of the use of synchrotron X-rays, Howard <span class="italic">et al.</span> employed high-definition XRF using the Maia XRF detector system on an X-ray microprobe, at the X-ray microscopy beamline at the Australian Synchrotron, Victoria, for the elemental mapping of paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit106"><sup><span class="sup_ref">106</span></sup></a> This revealed the distribution of metals in the pigments underlying the brush strokes and enabled the characterisation of a wide range of pigments, thereby providing knowledge of the pigments used in an artists work and allowing inference of the dates of the pigments' manufacture and patterns of use. Single point XRF was extensively used because of the ease with which it enabled pigment discrimination. Scanning XRF had the capability to spatially resolve elemental distributions in two dimensions and mobile scanning XRF systems are routinely employed for the <span class="italic">in situ</span> analysis of artwork. Three dimensional scanning is possible with the depth-sensitive technique of confocal XRF and speciation and the chemical environment of elements can be probed with XANES. One of the major disadvantages of scanning XRF was the slow pixel acquisition rate, usually around 1 s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> therefore restricting the size or the resolution of the scan and making full composition analysis of a painting very time consuming. For example, the elemental mapping of Van Gogh's <span class="italic">Patch of Grass</span> took around 2 days. On a painting measuring 510 mm wide by 600 mm high and with appropriate choice of beam energy to minimize Pb L shell fluorescence and Raman scattering, an elemental map was recorded in 22.5 hours. Compton scatter was found to yield information on the canvas weave. The experimental set up is described in detail in the paper.

PCA was employed to distinguish different materials, including painting materials and substrate materials, but also facilitated a study of the depth profiling of the rock painting.

            <span class="italic">LIBS</span> continues to command much interest in many other application areas, not least of which is <span class="italic">standoff detection of harmful materials</span>. Standoff LIBS has been employed for the classification of trace residues as either hazardous (explosives, biological, <span class="italic">etc</span>) or non-hazardous and has been reviewed in previous review articles, for example last year's review.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> LIBS is very suitable for this type of analysis due to the requirement for minimal or no sample preparation, the minimal sample amount required to generate a usable emission spectrum and the ability to generate a signal in standoff mode, in some cases from a distance of many meters. However, correct classification of the analyte is very substrate dependent and varies in difficulty depending on what is underneath the residue.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> The success of classification can be further compromised if the substrate material has similar elemental composition to the residue. De Lucia and Gottfried<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> have evaluated the coupling of <span class="italic">multivariate analysis with standoff LIBS</span> to determine the effectiveness of classifying thin explosive residue layers on a range of painted surfaces. They examine several organic substrates and determine the success of classification by LIBS using PLS-DA models with the goal to classify materials as either explosive or non-explosive irrespective of the substrate. A range of explosive materials were examined; cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), trinitrotoluene (TNT) and a 36% TNT, 63% RDX and 1% wax mixture. The mixtures (1–2 mg) were added to a range of car panels of various colours and paint types to give approximate surface coverage of around 10 μg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. A range of non-explosive materials, including road dust, sand, diesel, lubricating oil and fingerprint oil were also investigated. The standoff LIBS system and associated collection optics, together with optimized conditions are described in detail and employed a 1064 nm 10 Hz double pulse laser source with 5 ns pulse width. The sample area interrogated by the laser was estimated to be 5 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> at a standoff distance of 25 m. PLS-DA models were constructed based on preselected emission intensities and ratios and amounted to 132 variables, significantly fewer than the variables required when using whole spectra models. This approach resulted in the correct classification of either explosive or non-explosive materials on seven car panels with a true positive rate of 98% and a false positive rate of 2.7%. These rates were only marginally worse than data obtained using the whole spectra.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The influence of <span class="italic">metal substrates on the detection of explosive residues</span> was investigated by Gottfried.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> The results demonstrated that correct classification of RDX residue when applied to a range of metal substrates is feasible when PLS-DA is used. When limiting the spectral data examined to the features pertaining to RDX, a true positive rate of 96.5% and a false positive rate of 1.0% for RDX classification was achieved on a range of metal and metal alloy surfaces. PLS-DA was used by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span> to distinguish explosives from plastics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> They demonstrated that LIBS could discriminate explosives from seven types of plastics, although only one explosive was tested.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An alternative chemometric approach for identifying explosives by LIBS, employing <span class="italic">machine learning classifiers</span>, has been developed by Moros <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> A variety of organic residues, both explosive and potential interferent compounds located on a support surface were surveyed and their spectral responses determined. Relationships between the optical emission characteristics of residues and their hazardous nature have been extracted. By using the original intensities of the most relevant emission lines (C, CN, <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>2</sub></small>, H, N and O), supervised learning methods (SLMs) were employed to cope with the complex and subtle differences between the LIBS spectra of explosive residues and potential interferents. Relevant spectral features were extracted from a training set of data and, on the basis of 2-D scatter plots, the variables were then processed to search for trends serving to differentiate between classes. This approach is described in detail in the paper and was shown to be capable of discriminating a range of organic explosive residues from several potential interfering materials when placed on the surface of an aluminium support. False positives and false negatives were better than 5%. A slightly different approach by Fernandez-Bravo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> involved the <span class="italic">selective sampling of explosive residues on organic substrates</span>. Since ablation and subsequent plasma formation are sensitive to the beam focal conditions and the pulse energy at the surface, the choice of an appropriate set of experimental conditions enabled the surface sensitivity to be controlled. This enabled a selective analysis of the residue in the absence of any spectral contribution from the organic substrate. 2-mononitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene and 2,4,6-trinitirotulene were used as the model residues and nylon and Teflon were used as model substrates. Selective sampling of the residues on these substrates was successful in all cases where the plasma formation threshold of the residue was substantially different to the substrate.</p>

The plasma generated in LIBS experiments was employed to study the chemical reactions between metallic nanoparticles and RDX. Double pulse LIBS under argon was used to generate the plasma and exclude atmospheric nitrogen. Background corrected emission intensities for atomic and molecular species relevant to RDX were tracked over the first 10 μs of the laser induced plasma lifetime. Bremsstrahlung background features were subtracted to give relevant emission lines for C, H and N. The molecular species exhibited very different time-dependent behaviour. Similarities between the chemistry within an explosion and a plasma are discussed in this paper. The time resolved atomic and molecular emissions of aluminium nanoparticles and organic species from the RDX, within the plasma were measured to gain an understanding of this chemistry. This confirmed that the presence of aluminium promotes the ejection process of carbon from the intermediate RDX reaction products and assumptions made in previous kinetic studies were shown to be invalid.</p>

The authors propose that this method of classification is sufficiently robust for the screening for counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Further work is required, involving the selection of spectral features, rather than the inclusion of the whole spectrum, which the authors postulate may worsen the model.

The reviewer notes that in the case of metformin the chlorine atom is present in the counter ion and not covalently bonded to the molecule. This procedure, therefore, relies on the presence of metformin as the hydrochloride.

Previous studies with <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au Mössbauer (cited in this paper) have proposed a monomeric Auranofin with linear S–Au–P coordination. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed the proposed binding environment of the gold atom. Early attempts with ESI-MS showed several gold species in the mass spectrum but did not preclude the possibility that these were formed in the ESI interface. In this paper, data from both LC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS and LC-ICP-MS has shown that the monomeric Auranofin is eluted from the column and the other species are formed in the ESI interface. It was shown that monomeric Auranofin is the main compound to undergo exchange reactions with added thiol ligands. Adduct formation of the gold species with glutathione and human serum albumin was simulated successfully <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and analysed by LC-ESI-MS and LC-ICP-MS. This showed that whilst the thiol ligand is displaced, the remaining triethylphosphine gold structure may covalently bind to either glutathione or human serum albumin. Moreover, oxidation of the phosphine ligand by disulphides occurs in both reaction mixtures. Phosphine oxide is the resulting product in both cases. Reactions of Auranofin with the thiols were quantitatively traced over several days by ICP-MS. This data enabled a potential reaction pathway of Auranofin with the two endogenous thiols to be proposed.</span>

Results obtained have shown that quantitation was successful regardless of the mobile phase composition once these correction strategies were applied. S-containing metabolites were readily distinguishable from endogenous S-containing compounds in animal studies and the authors propose this as a viable alternative to the use of radio labelled compounds or the necessity for having synthetic standards of the anticipated metabolites.

Pd and other metals are extensively used in pharmaceutical small molecule drug substance processes as catalysts and must be removed prior to release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Shaw <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> have evaluated TXRF instruments from two vendors (Bruker AXS, Technos) to establish whether TXRF can be used to accurately, precisely and sensitively determine Pd in pharmaceutical drug substances and whether it can be used to screen for other pharmaceutically relevant metals. They also looked at the advantages of TXRF as compared with ICP-MS for these analyses. Six drug substances (triprolidine HCl, diphenylhydramine HCl, chlorpheniramne maleate, pseudoephedrine HCl, ephedrine sulphate and scotamine HBr) were analysed by both instruments, each configured to access either Pd-L shell (binding energy 3.61 keV) or the Pd–K shell (24.35KeV), to determine linearity, accuracy and precision for Cr, Fe, Pd, Pt and Rh. Interferences from Ar, Cl and S were checked at various fluorescence lines. Internal standardisation was found to be important to remove systematic errors resulting from variations in spotting and drying of the samples. The results for Pd on each instrument in their different configurations are shown, with detection limits between 0.001 μg ml<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 3 μg ml<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and performance being very dependent upon the instrument configuration. The difference between the detection of Pd-L and Pd–K lines was very important and instruments with access to Pd–K lines were found to be most effective in determining Pd in APIs. The primary advantages of TXRF are its ability to accept organic solvent diluents, its ease of use and low operational cost when compared with ICP-MS. The authors concluded that TXRF based upon Pd detection is an ideal screening platform. However, an instrument with multiple sources would open the technique to wider use but at greater cost.

Microwave-induced combustion (MIC) has been applied for the digestion of APIs and subsequent determination of bromine and iodine by ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">137</span></sup></a> Ten APIs including amoxicillin, atenolol, clavulanic acid, clonazepan, diltiazem, haloperidol, imipramine, nimesulide, propranolol and sodium diclofenac were digested by MIC. Combustion of 500 mg of each API was achieved in &lt;30 s using 20 bar oxygen. Ammonium carbonate (50 mM) was the absorbing solution for both analytes and a 5 minutes reflux step was included to maximize recoveries. Recoveries for Br and I from CRMs, after going through the same digestion procedure were 95 and 97% respectively. Residual carbon was determined by ICP-OES and was found to be &lt;500 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, an important consideration when determining the analytes by ICP-MS. Detection limits for Br and I by ICP-MS were 0.001 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.02 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively, compared with 4.2 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.3 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> by IC.</span>

          <p class="otherpara">It is often desirable to directly analyse solid samples with no dissolution step, to minimize the potential for contamination or analyte loss, especially where very limited amounts of material are available.

For each sample, 2 replicates of 0.8 to 2.0 mg of paint were weighed directly onto a graphite ETV boat which was placed into the ETV furnace for vaporisation at 2200 °C. The vapour was then transferred into the ICP in an Ar carrier containing Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>F<small><sub>2</sub></small>C reactant gas. Numerous elements were monitored but the very high sample introduction efficiency meant that several elements saturated the detector and the less sensitive elements were chosen.

Normalisation of the emission of each chosen element to an Ar line was carried out, followed by integration of the signal. The data matrices, comprised of the integrated areas divided by the sample mass for each of the elements, were then subjected to PCA, cluster analysis and LDA. After identifying the major contributing variables by PCA, LDA was performed and showed that a combination of three or four variables from Cr, Pb, Sn and Zn correctly assigned each of the red paint samples to the correct source car. The correct assignment of the paint samples relies strongly upon the precision of the analysis and typical RSD values of between 6% and 12% were sufficient.</p>

          <span>There have been several applications published that involve the use of a <span class="italic">separation technique coupled with an atomic spectrometric detector</span>. Such a coupling would normally be described as speciation analysis and it enables the different oxidation states or different chemical forms of an analyte present in a sample to be determined. The large majority of these applications are outside the remit of this update and are, instead, reviewed in a separate update. There are, however, some applications that are directly relevant to this review and these will be discussed below.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">metal to halide mole ratios in platinum complex ions</span> have been determined by van Wyk <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> who used HPLC-ICP-OES to separate the species and then detect Br, Cl and Pt. The complex ions took the form of [PtCl<small><sub>6−<span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>Br<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>]<small><sup>2−</sup></small>, [PtCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>]<small><sup>2−</sup></small> and [PtCl<small><sub>6</sub></small>]<small><sup>2−</sup></small> where <span class="italic">n</span> could range from 0 to 6. The different species were separated using a reversed phase, octadecylsilane column using the ion pairing reagent tetrabutylammonium nitrate and the analytes were detected at 177.708, 134.724 and 148.845 nm for Pt, Cl and Br respectively. All nine possible species were detected when monitoring Pt emission but, of course, only eight peaks were observed for Cl because no peak would appear for the species [PtBr<small><sub>6</sub></small>]<small><sup>2−</sup></small>. Similarly, the Br chromatogram produced only seven peaks since no emission signal was observed for [PtCl<small><sub>6</sub></small>]<small><sup>2−</sup></small> and [PtCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>]<small><sup>2−</sup></small>. It was noted though, that resolution between some of the species was quite poor which could lead to inaccuracies in some of the mole ratios calculated. Optimization of the separation process did yield sufficiently good resolution, albeit by ESI-MS detection. The eluent used for the separation was 55% acetonitrile, 45% water, containing 9 mM tetrabutylammonium nitrate. The other problem reported was that very large concentrations of species had to be injected so that the halogens could be determined. This was because they have a particularly poor LOD using ICP emission techniques. Despite these problems, the authors did report that the method was the first developed to determine them in such a way.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several applications have utilized <span class="italic">capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with ICP-MS</span> detection. In one such application, Varenne <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">144</span></sup></a> used CE-ICP-MS to determine metal affinities and binding constants of phosphorylated ligands. A standard 80 cm × 70 μm capillary was treated with methanol, followed by water and then dilute NaOH. The inner surface was then coated with a 0.1% m m<small><sup>−1</sup></small> solution of polybrene containing a large excess of the chloride form of the anion exchange resin AG MP-1 present in a formic acid/sodium chloride separation buffer. The operating conditions for the CE-ICP-MS system were listed in the paper and a specialist low-flow nebulizer was used. The coupling between the CE and ICP-MS instruments was <span class="italic">via</span> a home-made sheath–flow interface, the principles of which were also given. Fifteen phosphorylated compounds, including phosphine oxides, thiophosphines, phosphonates and phosphinates, were separated in less than one hour and using less than 5 ng of material. The P-containing compounds could be classified according to their Eu<small><sup>III</sup></small> binding affinity in a hydro-organic medium (sodium formate, pH 3.7, water–methanol in a 90–10 mix). By varying the total Eu concentration, complexation constants could be determined according to a sequential multiple run strategy. The data obtained were in excellent agreement with the values obtained using UV-Vis spectrophotometric titrations. The identification and quantification of potential metabolites of Gd-containing contrast agents used for magnetic resonance imaging were reported by Telgmann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145</span></sup></a> who used CE-ICP-MS as well as CE-ESI-MS for the task. In particular, the products formed after electrochemical oxidation were studied. The ESI-MS elucidated the structure of the products whereas the ICP-MS was better suited to quantifying the species. Two products were identified from the oxidation of the compound gadopentate. The material underwent an N-dealkylation reaction. One of the metabolites was unstable and underwent further decomposition. Under the conditions used in the experiment, 8.7% of the original compound was oxidized.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">It is well known that when CE or any ultra-low flow method is coupled with an atomic spectrometric detector, the suction effect exerted by the nebulizer can destroy the chromatography. A paper by Cheng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit146"><sup><span class="sup_ref">146</span></sup></a> discussed the elimination of this problem when using <span class="italic">microchip electrophoresis coupled with ICP-MS</span> (MCE-ICP-MS) by using porous monolithic plugs. The system was very complex, but involved a microchip, a demountable capillary micro-flow nebulizer, a heated single pass spray chamber, a negative pressure sampling device, a high voltage power supply, a syringe pump and the ICP-MS instrument. Full details and a schematic diagram of the setup were given in the paper. Full details were also given for the preparation of the chip and of the porous polymer plugs that were inserted into the chip to prevent the suction effects. Optimization of the electrophoresis was undertaken and this included a study of the flow rate, the buffer system used, the voltage applied and separation paths of different length. The eluent from the chip was transferred to the nebulizer by 0.1% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> containing 10 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> In as an internal standard at a flow rate of 10 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

The sample was introduced to the system and the two analytes were separated using an electric field of 857 V cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a running buffer of 10 mM borate (pH 9.2). The separation path was only 15 mm long and this enabled the species to be separated within 25 s.

          <span>The relevant papers in this section of the review concentrated on the <span class="italic">forensic analysis of gunshot residue</span>. In one, by Latzel <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">147</span></sup></a> milli-XRF was used to provide an elemental map of the area of bullet impact and this could then be used to estimate the approximate shooting distance. A numerical tool was presented that displayed the data and enabled a more reliable estimate of shooting range to be made. Despite the advances made, the authors admitted that some problems still existed and these included when there were only a few residue spots spread over a large distance or when the material on which the residue is deposited provides a highly scattering background. The paper presented many of these problems and concluded that the spectral interpretation could not be fully automated since an experienced analyst was required to verify some of the points. A second application, this time by Abrego <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit148"><sup><span class="sup_ref">148</span></sup></a> described the development of a LA-ICP-MS method for the unambiguous characterization of gunshot residue. Tape lifts were used to collect the residues from skin surfaces and these were then analysed for their <small><sup>121</sup></small>Sb, <small><sup>137</sup></small>Ba and <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb content. Several other analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span><small><sup>27</sup></small>Al, <small><sup>29</sup></small>Si, <small><sup>33</sup></small>S, <small><sup>35</sup></small>Cl, <small><sup>39</sup></small>K, <small><sup>44</sup></small>Ca, <small><sup>57</sup></small>Fe, <small><sup>60</sup></small>Ni, <small><sup>63</sup></small>Cu, <small><sup>66</sup></small>Zn and <small><sup>118</sup></small>Sn, were also monitored to obtain additional information. Numerous different firearms, calibres and ammunition were used during the study. It was demonstrated that the LA-ICP-MS approach could be a real alternative to the standard SEM-EDX protocol and had the added advantage of being much quicker.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Another interesting application was described by Taborelli <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">149</span></sup></a> There is very little literature on the <span class="italic">radiochemical and microscopic analysis of gunshot wounds</span> in decomposed material and even less in skeletonized samples. There is also very little information on the survival of gunshot residues in skeletonized samples. The authors therefore undertook a study in which nine gunshot wounds were produced on pig heads and these were allowed to skeletonize for a period of four years. At the same time, four gunshot entries on human heads from judicial cases were also studied. The human samples were macerated to the bone in water prior to analysis. In all cases, analysis was performed using SEM-EDX. A partial success was reported, with four of the nine pig samples and all four of the human samples demonstrating positive results. In the human samples, two lesions showed traces of Pb and Sb, one only Pb and the fourth Ba, Pb and Sb. This was a pilot study and the authors noted the necessity of further studies to ascertain the environmental modifications that occur to gunshot residue. A paper by Rinke <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit150"><sup><span class="sup_ref">150</span></sup></a> described the use of LIBS and several chemometric techniques to discriminate between several different types of 9 mm ammunition. Different manufacturers and ammunition with different jackets (non-jacketed, copper jacketed and metallic alloy jacketed) were tested. Some of the bullets were fired through steel plates and the edges of the holes then analysed. Other bullets were scraped manually along steel plates and others along some porcelain. The analyses were performed using LIBS utilizing a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm with a pulse width of 9 ns and an energy of 63 mJ pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Data were acquired over the wavelength range 200 to 500 nm with 12 spectra being collected from each hole or scrape line. The data matrix collected was analysed using target factor analysis with a Bayesian soft classifier being used to calculate probability and the Pearson correlation coefficient also being used. Of the 36 single sample transfers, the copper-jacketed and non-jacketed ammunition had a probability of 1 of the jacket material being transferred to the porcelain after a scrape. The metal alloy-jacketed ammunition was less successfully detected on both steel and porcelain substrates. The analysis of the bullet hole walls was also not entirely successful, with over 50% of the samples leaving insufficient transfer to be identified.</p>

One of the main advantages of LIBS is that it may be used remotely, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it has a “stand-off” capability that enables analytes to be measured in a substance at a distance.

          <p class="otherpara">Two papers by the same research group have <span class="italic">determined contaminants in gases</span>. In one, Eseller <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">151</span></sup></a> determined He in gas mixtures comprising mainly of hydrogen. At very high concentrations of He (&gt;7.25%) the LIBS signal was quenched because of Penning ionization. The H alpha line at 656.28 nm broadened with increasing He content. The He was determined at 587.56 nm. The system was optimized in terms of the laser energy, the delay time between the laser pulse and the acquisition of data and the gas pressure. The signal showed good correlation with He concentrations up to 1% and the optimized system had a LOD of 78 ppm. In a paper by Tripathi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152</span></sup></a> the work was extended to include the determination of several analytes (Ar, He, N and O) in hydrogen fuel used for rockets. This paper provided both schematic diagrams and photographs of the system used. A frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser operating at an energy of 110 mJ pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and with a pulse frequency of 10 Hz was focussed through the sample cell and then the emission from the analytes in the plasma was reflected back to the spectrometer which had three different gratings present. The grating that had 1200 lines mm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> provided sufficient resolution for the determination of the analytes. The detector was an intensified CCD containing 1024 × 256 pixels and was operated with a 300 ns gate delay and a 2 μs gate width. Each recorded LIBS spectrum was the average of 450 laser pulses. Unfortunately, although the spectrometer had sufficient resolution to separate the analyte lines, it had narrow spectral range coverage and could not detect all of the analytes simultaneously. Therefore, Ar, N and O were determined (at 763.51, 746.83 and 777.35 nm, respectively) and then the grating was moved so that the He could be determined at 587.56 nm. A notch filter had to be used for the successful determination of He because otherwise, the signal was swamped by the presence of light originating from H. The optimized system yielded LOD of 97, 25, 80 and 10 ppm for Ar, He, N and O respectively.</p>

            <span class="italic">Double pulse LIBS</span> has been shown in the past to offer some advantages over the single pulse version. Two papers that used double pulse LIBS are worth reporting. Heilbrunner <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">153</span></sup></a> used double pulse LIBS to determine trace elements (Al and P) in iron oxide. The LIBS system used was a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser operating with a pulse duration of 6 ns, an inter-pulse delay time of 500 ns and at an energy of 140 mJ pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The performances of a CCD and an intensified CCD were compared during the analysis. The operation of these different detectors including their temperature of operation (−20 and −60 °C for iCCD and CCD respectively) and their mechanisms of gating were discussed at length. Samples were placed on a rotating stage to ensure that the same spot did not undergo continual ablation. Use of the CCD detector resulted in significantly higher signal to noise ratios and consequently lower LOD for both Al and P when compared with the iCCD detector. However, the CCD detector required a greater number of laser pulses to achieve an acceptable signal quality. This would be a disadvantage when determining elements that become depleted, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> B. The authors presented experimental data demonstrating that an increased number of laser pulses on the same site led to a decreasing B signal whist the Fe signal remained virtually unchanged. The other paper to report the use of double pulse LIBS was provided by Suliyanti <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">154</span></sup></a> who determined Ca and Cl in an attempt to evaluate the strength of concrete. Instead of using the same laser to provide the two pulses, as was the case in the previous paper, these authors used two separate lasers in orthogonal geometry. The first laser (Nd:YAG operating at 1064 nm with an energy of 110 mJ and a repetition rate of 10 Hz) produced a plasma in the helium atmosphere about 5 mm in front of the sample surface. The second laser (Nd:YAG operating at 532 nm) then provided a pulse 10 μs after the helium plasma was formed. The ablated material then entered the helium plasma where light emitted was collected and transported <span class="italic">via</span> a fibre optic to the spectrometer and detector. The power of the second laser was varied. At a power of 135 mJ, a crater with a diameter of 0.7 mm was created. Such a large crater is obviously undesirable. However, this was reduced in size to 10 μm when an energy of 2.5 mJ was used. The double pulse LIBS system provided a very large enhancement in sensitivity compared with the single pulse version. The LOD for Cl was 80 ppm.</p>

Ten laser shots were used to provide an emission signal that compensated for any laser beam energy fluctuations. The signal to background ratio improved when helium or argon was used instead of air at a reduced pressure (500 mbar).

Calibration was by analysis of samples with a known B concentration in silicon. A calibration graph between 0 and 100 ppm B was shown. Although the correlation coefficient was only 0.89, a LOD of 0.2 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was claimed. The system was also applied to the molten silicon sample (1410 °C) but ensuring that the laser was moved further away (increasing the distance from 11 cm to 50 cm) to ensure that it was not damaged by splashes of the molten material.</p>

Parameters such as the time delay, gate width and laser pulse energy were all optimized and were different for different zeolite types. Similarly, the number of laser pulses averaged to provide the signals also varied with sample type, with 20 shots being sufficient for mordenite and zeolite type Y but 50 shots being required for ZSM-5.

          <span>Two papers have described the preparation of <span class="italic">isotopically enriched reference materials</span>.

The Cr(<span class="small_caps">VI</span>) solution was prepared by fusion of <small><sup>50</sup></small>Cr enriched chromium oxide with sodium potassium carbonate and sodium hydroxide in a platinum crucible on a Bunsen burner. After cooling, the melt was dissolved in concentrated HCl and then diluted to 10 mL. The Cr(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) was prepared by microwave assisted nitric acid dissolution of <small><sup>53</sup></small>Cr enriched chromium oxide. After dissolution, the material was transferred to a platinum crucible, evaporated to 0.2 mL and then HCl added before dilution to 10 mL. The concentrations of the materials were determined using ID-ICP-MS and were 197.2 ± 0.8 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 200.3 ± 0.9 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for <small><sup>50</sup></small>Cr(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) and <small><sup>53</sup></small>Cr(<span class="small_caps">VI</span>) respectively. The purity of the compounds was verified by speciation analysis using the coupling of an anion exchange column with ICP-MS detection. The chromatographic conditions were discussed in the paper. The speciation system was also used to determine the effects of trace oxidants or reductants in the samples. In the absence of any oxidants or reductants, the species were stable for at least 18 months. The other paper to report the production of isotopic reference materials was by Vogl and Rosner.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> These workers produced and then certified a unique set of isotope reference materials (ERM-AE102a and ERM-AE104a) in which the absolute isotope ratios were determined and offset δ <small><sup>11</sup></small>B materials (ERM-AE120, ERM-AE121 and ERM-AE122) for B isotope determination in sample types as diverse as geochemical, environmental and industrial. All of the materials were prepared by mixing (under full gravimetric control) parent solutions enriched in <small><sup>10</sup></small>B or <small><sup>11</sup></small>B with a parent solution of natural B isotopic content. The B isotopic composition in the parent solutions was determined using TIMS. The resulting solutions were analysed to determine total B content as well as their isotopic composition using ID-TIMS. For all five reference materials the isotopic composition obtained on the basis of gravimetric data agreed well with those obtained using the TIMS techniques. Stability and homogeneity tests indicated that there was no effect on isotopic composition or on the related uncertainties. The certified δ<small><sup>11</sup></small>B values were: −20.2, 19.9 and 39.7 parts per thousand for ERM-AE120, -121 and -122, respectively, meaning that they were the first certified materials with δ<small><sup>11</sup></small>B values that were not zero parts per thousand. For ERM-AE102a and ERM-AE104a, the certified <small><sup>10</sup></small>B isotope abundances were 0.29995 and 0.31488 respectively with expanded uncertainties of 0.00027 and 0.00028.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Other papers have also reported <span class="italic">isotopic analysis of materials</span>, but have not produced reference materials. Gautier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit163"><sup><span class="sup_ref">163</span></sup></a> used TIMS to undertake the isotopic analysis of germanium. A new sample loading protocol was developed in which germanium powder was mixed with a commercial cellulose nitrate adhesive that had been diluted in acetone. The mixture (totalling approximately 0.3 mg of Ge) was then placed on the rhenium filament. The advantage of the technique was that it avoided the problems associated with the dissolution of the germanium (neither a mixture of HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> nor <span class="italic">aqua regia</span> dissolved the sample completely). Unfortunately, there is no suitable CRM for Ge isotopic analysis and so the authors used some natural germanium under the assumption that it would have the natural isotopic composition published by IUPAC to enable them to calculate the mass fractionation factor which was then applied to the analysis of two enriched samples (containing 84.10 and 82.60% of <small><sup>76</sup></small>Ge). The only other isotope of note was <small><sup>74</sup></small>Ge, which was present at approximately 14%. The other isotopes were all &lt;1% abundant. Determination of the <small><sup>76</sup></small>Ge/<small><sup>74</sup></small>Ge isotope ratio led to a precision of between 0.2 and 0.3% being obtained (<span class="italic">n</span> = 6). Huyskens <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit164"><sup><span class="sup_ref">164</span></sup></a> evaluated different sources of colloidal silica gels as emission activators for ionization of Pb during TIMS analyses. As well as the Pb and U blank levels in the materials, the authors also tested their ionization efficiency, signal stability, degree of fractionation and the reproducibility and accuracy of the Pb isotopic ratios measured using them as activators. Further tests to evaluate the dependency of the ionization on particle size, the concentration of the silica gel and the mixing ratio of the gels with phosphoric acid were also performed. Mass fractionation, reproducibility, and stability of the ion beam were monitored using the Pb isotope standard SRM 981. The products from four manufacturers were compared. Two provided far better isotope ratio data than the other two whilst also having significantly less Pb and U contamination. As well as providing more accurate ratios, they were also precise with precision for the <small><sup>207</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>206</sup></small>Pb ratio being 0.05%. Ionization efficiency was not dependent on the particle size but did depend on the concentration of the silica gel and its mixing ratio with phosphoric acid. The highest ionization efficiency (9.2 ± 2.2%) was obtained using 0.004 mL of silica gel at a concentration of 0.4% by weight of silica loaded with 0.05 mL of 0.02 N phosphoric acid.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Numerous interesting applications have been published in this review period, although there is no trend towards any particular topic area. Heinrich and Kipphardt<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> used methane as a gaseous modifier during the <span class="italic">ETAAS determination of Si in aqueous samples</span>. Using a mixture of 5% methane in argon that was bled into the atmosphere of the ETAAS tube, significant improvements in peak shape (a double peak in the absence of the methane being transformed into a single peak) and sensitivity (a two-fold increase) were obtained. In addition, increased pyrolysis temperatures were achievable. These improvements occurred at pyrolysis temperatures greater than 1300 °C and this was attributed to the methane decomposing, producing a very reducing atmosphere as well as soot. The production of soot caused a significant increase in the background signal during atomization. Consequently, a flush period of 6 to 10 s duration, where only argon was introduced, was inserted between the pyrolysis and atomization stages. This removed much of the soot leading to improved atomic absorption whilst still obtaining the benefits provided by the reducing atmosphere. Under optimal conditions (pyrolysis and atomization temperatures of 1350 and 2450 °C, respectively), characteristic masses (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the mass of the analyte giving rise to an absorbance of 0.0044) of 50 and 30 pg were obtained using a standard transversely heated graphite atomizer and an end-capped transversely heated graphite atomizer. These were less than other matrix modifiers that had been used previously. An added advantage of the gaseous modifier was that it introduced fewer contaminants than liquid modifiers. This enabled a very low LOD of 0.2 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to be obtained.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Resano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a> described the <span class="italic">analysis of silica using solid sampling ETAAS</span>. The procedure for the solid sampling was slightly different to the usual protocols in that carbon (1.5 mg) was first weighed onto the platform, followed by the sample and then the liquid modifiers palladium and nitric acid (if required). The platform was then introduced to the instrument in the normal way. Calibration was achieved using aqueous standards. The method was validated by using the CRM NCS DC73304. Although this is a rock sample, it comprises 90% Si, with Al and Fe both representing approximately 3% m m<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and was therefore of a similar composition to the materials being analysed. The temperature programs used were optimized for each of the analytes (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Sb). In the absence of the graphite powder, a hole was quickly formed in the platform and this was attributed to the reaction between the silica and the carbon. Addition of the graphite powder extended the lifetime of the platform significantly. As well as the use of the CRM, the data obtained using solid sampling ETAAS were compared with those obtained using a dissolution followed by ICP-OES determination. The results were in agreement although the ETAAS method provided significantly better LOD (&lt;0.1 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for all analytes). Precision was 6–9% which was fit for purpose and is normal for solid sampling ETAAS.</p>

The overall concentration depended on the manufacturer and on the year of manufacture. However, in all cases, the large majority of the Hg congregated in the phosphor powder (∼85.76%) and a smaller amount diffused though the glass matrix (13.66%).

The salt was dissolved in water, buffered to pH 6 and then the analytes were chelated with violuric acid and the chelates then retained on multi-walled carbon nanotubes. After removal of the solution, the analytes could be eluted and then determined using FAAS. Parameters such as pH, amount of violuric acid, flow rates, eluent type and sample volume were all investigated. Under optimized conditions, the quantification limits were 0.36 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 0.43 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 0.15 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.38 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cu, Pb, Co and Fe, respectively and precision was better than 10% RSD. The protocol was validated by the analysis of several CRMs, including TMDA 54.4 fortified lake water, NIST 1515 apple leaves and HR-1 Humber river sediment. The analysis of the salt was partially successful, with Fe being found in the concentration range 1.6 to 6.4 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and Pb being found in only one sample, but at a concentration of 5.0 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The other analytes were still less than the LOD, despite the preconcentration factor.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A novel application was described by Bucker and Acker<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> who used <span class="italic">high resolution continuum source absorption spectroscopy</span> to determine HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, HF and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SiF<small><sub>6</sub></small> in process etching solutions used to treat the saw damage inflicted on silicon wafers. Since the solar cells need to have a consistent texturization, the composition of the etching baths needs to be known and maintained at a constant level. The Si was monitored at the 251.611 nm line whereas the nitrate was measured as the molecular absorption arising from NO at a wavelength of 214.803 nm and the fluoride was monitored through the AlF molecule at 227.46 nm. The characteristic masses were actually quite impressive, with that for nitrate being the worst at 20 ng, the Si was 130 pg and the fluoride was 13 pg. Therefore, huge dilutions of the sample were required for them to come onto the linear range. Calibration was against aqueous standards. A lanthanum modifier was used for the electrothermal molecular absorbance of the fluoride and of the nitrate and a palladium–magnesium nitrate modifier was used for the determination of the Si. Alternative techniques were used for method verification, with ICP-OES determining the Si and ion chromatography determining the nitrate and hydrofluoric acid. In general, the results obtained using the alternative methods were in good agreement with those data obtained using the proposed methodology. The relative uncertainties were greater for the developed method when compared with the alternative, but the levels were still fit for purpose. The nitrate and Si could be determined directly. However, the hydrofluoric acid had to be calculated as the difference between total fluoride and that present within the molecule H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SiF<small><sub>6</sub></small>. Spiking experiments led to recoveries within the range 96–105% for most analytes in most of the samples measured. The authors concluded that their method had the advantage of being capable of determining the acids and the metal impurities using the same instrument.</p>

            <span class="italic">Numerous analytical techniques</span> were employed by Bencs <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> to determine the Cr, Fe and Mn dopants in lithium niobate optical crystals. The samples were analysed using solid-sampling ETAAS and solution-based analyses such as ETAAS, FAAS, ICP-OES and ICP-MS. The crystals were first pulverized to form a homogeneous powder. For the solid-sampling ETAAS protocol, the powders were weighed (0.05 to 5 mg, depending on the analyte) directly onto platforms ready for insertion into the tube. Standard additions were required to obtain reliable data, with the analyte addition from aqueous standards preserved in 0.05 M HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> or 0.24 M HCl. The addition of 20 μL of the standards and the drying process occurred prior to weighing of the sample. The dissolution process involved the material being heated in a platinum crucible with potassium chloride and sulfuric acid. After cooling, the solid melt was dissolved in either 8M HF or 1 M triammonium citrate before being diluted to 100 mL. Boric acid was then introduced to remove the fluoride prior to analysis using ICP-OES. The sample had to be diluted further for ICP-MS measurements, but remained undiluted for FAAS and ICP-OES determinations. Each of the protocols was optimized and the resulting figures of merit presented in tabular form. Unsurprisingly, the solution-based ICP-MS technique provided the best LOD and the FAAS supplied the worst. The solid sampling ETAAS method provided quite poor LOD, but this was attributed to the necessity of using less sensitive lines to accommodate the high concentrations present in the crystal and the additions made for calibration. In addition, an increased internal argon flow rate was also required to decrease sensitivity. The authors rounded off their study by using XANES to study the residue left on the platform used in ETAAS.</p>

            <span>Asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (A4F) is a well known method for determining the particle size and distribution of nano-sized particles, and is coming increasingly applied to the analysis of engineered nanoparticles. It has been known for many years that many nanoparticle types can be problematic in that they readily agglomerate, forming far larger assemblies of particles. These cause some serious problems for analysts in that they readily sink to the bottom of containers, providing inhomogeneous samples. Even if they are kept in suspension, the agglomerates are often so large that they will be discriminated against by the nebuliser–spray chamber assemblies of ICP instruments and will not reach the plasma. Significant underestimates of the nanoparticle concentration can, therefore, be obtained. Many nanoparticle materials are stabilized using dispersants or coatings. However, both of these are prone to failure if there is a change in ionic strength of the sample (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> if it is changed by dilution), change in pH <span class="italic">etc.</span> A paper by Ulrich <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> discussed the critical aspects of sample handling for direct nanoparticle analysis and the analytical challenges to using A4F <span class="italic">coupled online with numerous detector types</span>. The paper by Ulrich <span class="italic">et al.</span> adopted a multi-detector approach in which the A4F separation was coupled online with a diode array UV-Vis detector, a multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) instrument in which a glass fibre optic collected light at 108° and presented that to a dynamic light scattering (DLS) detector and an ICP-MS instrument. The flow through the first two detectors was split by a factor of 200 for the ICP-MS analysis and an internal standard (10 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Ir) was added online to help overcome non-spectroscopic interferences. Several types of nanoparticles were investigated including silver coated with citric acid, silver coated with polyvinylalcohol and titanium oxide functionalized with polyacrylate. Both types of silver nanoparticle increased in size when diluted (from 10–12 nm to &gt;25 nm) whereas the titanium nanoparticles remained unchanged. Addition of sodium nitrate had a similar, but more significant, effect on the silver nanoparticles. A change of pH delivered significant changes to the nanoparticles. The silver-polyvinylalcohol ones agglomerated rapidly and reached 150 nm over a period of 120 minutes. The silver-citrate ones increased to 120 nm over 60 minutes and then stabilized. The titanium-polyacrylate particles increased from approximately 300 nm to 2000 nm over a time period of 60 minutes. Another problem noted in the study was that of particle–membrane interactions; caused by electrostatic charges. Three membrane materials were tested: polyethersulfone, regenerated cellulose and polyvinylidene difluoride. The authors proposed a hypothesis that could be used to explain the interactions, but admitted that further study was required to substantiate it.</span>

In addition to characterizing different silver nanoparticle types, the authors also distinguished between nanoparticulate and ionic Ag by use of an ultracentrifugation protocol. The multi-detector approach led to greatly improved reliability of data compared with those obtained using batch DLS detection and was significantly faster than TEM whilst also enabling the materials to be determined directly in suspension. Loeschner <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> also developed a multi-detector system for the determination of polyvinylpyrrolidone-stabilized silver nanoparticles. Again, A4F was coupled on line with light absorbance, light scattering and ICP-MS detection systems with each of the components giving slightly different information on the nanoparticulate materials being eluted.

Size calibration was obtained using two approaches, namely the use of polystyrene nanoparticles and from theory.

Using this combination of detectors, it was possible to determine the mass isotopic signature of the silver nanoparticles as a function of their size and optical properties. This provided the specificity that is necessary for differentiating labelled silver nanoparticles from their naturally occurring or anthropogenic analogues. The authors applied their methodology to the detection of silver nanoparticles in estuarine sediments. A sediment suspension was doped with enriched <small><sup>109</sup></small>Ag nanoparticles stabilized using humic and fulvic acids.

Particle size calibration was achieved using gold particles of 10, 30 and 60 nm diameter. The eluate from the A4F was diluted online with 3% nitric acid containing the internal standards Rh and Y. This diluent was replaced during blank runs with standards of known Ti content. This enabled calibration of the concentration to be achieved.

Titanium tetraisopropoxide was fed into a stagnation swirl flame setup (the design and operating conditions of which are given in the paper) and this resulted in the production of the nanoparticles. A novel low energy LIBS system used a laser beam operating at 532 nm with a frequency of 10 Hz and an energy of 35 mJ per pulse (28 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>). The laser beam caused an area of approximately 200 μm in diameter and 1 mm in length to emit light and this was collected at 90° using a 0.5 m spectrometer containing a grating (2400 grooves per mm) and an intensified CCD camera. The collection optics and detection system were described in detail. At the energy used, a macroscopic spark was not produced and the system was capable of generating emission from the particles, but not from the precursor compound. The emission intensity increased with increasing particle size, but then plateaued when the particle was greater than six nm in diameter. However, when the precursor concentration is above 150 ppm (corresponding to a particle size of 6 to 8 nm) the emission intensity increases linearly with concentration.

The particles were deposited on the tip of one of the 500 μm diameter needles (the tip was the only exposed part since the walls were insulated).

The phases were allowed to separate by either placing the sample in an oven or by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 15 min. Placing the sample tube in ice thickened the surfactant rich phase and allowed the aqueous phase to be removed more easily. Aliquots (20 μL) of the surfactant rich phase were then analysed using ETAAS. Initially, approximately 14% of the Au<small><sup>III</sup></small> was extracted into the surfactant phase, hence potentially interfering with the signal obtained from ionic and particulate Au species. The presence of the thiosulfate reduced all Au<small><sup>III</sup></small> ions to Au<small><sup>I</sup></small> and then formed a negatively charged complex with them, preventing their extraction into the surfactant phase. The extraction efficiency of the gold nanoparticles was dependent on the size, but ranged from 101 ± 6% for particles of 2 nm diameter down to 52 ± 16% for those up to 150 nm. The presence of organic material in the samples was tolerable to a concentration of 10 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

            <span id="sect1653"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">2.3.5.2. Single particle analysis. </span>
            <span>It is well known that single particle analysis requires an extremely rapid acquisition time (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the dwell time must be very low) and that very dilute samples are required for analysis. This is to help reduce the possibility of more than one particle being analysed simultaneously. It is, therefore, assumed that a detected pulse corresponds to a single particle event. The number of pulses is directly correlated with the number of particles present and the intensity of the pulse (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the signal height) is proportional to the size of the nanoparticle. Problems can be experienced though since the particles are generally assumed to be spherical. If they are nanowires or irregular in shape, estimation of the particle number concentration from the mass concentration, particle density and shape is difficult. However, if a few assumptions are made so that an estimation of particle number concentration is obtained, it is possible to make an approximation of the particle size from the size of the analyte signal. There is still some debate as to how successful this approach is, but numerous research groups have attempted to provide some insight.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">A paper by Mitrano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit182"><sup><span class="sup_ref">182</span></sup></a> discussed the use of two of the most powerful methods available for the analysis of engineered nanoparticles; <span class="italic">i.e., single particle characterization and A4F</span> for the analysis of silver nanoparticles. A range of dwell times between 0.1 and 20 ms were tested with 10 ms being optimal, although the data were shown in an electronic supplement rather than in the paper itself. With very rapid dwell times, the possibility of more than one particle being detected at the same time is decreased, but the precision of the determination can be affected adversely. The paper discussed the operational parameters of both techniques and led the reader through their optimization. The two techniques were compared for their size and concentration detection limits, resolution and their multi-form elemental analysis capabilities. Detection limits in terms of particle number and on a mass basis were significantly better for the single particle approach, with LOD at the ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level being obtained compared with the A4F which had LOD at the μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level. The size resolution was, however, far superior for A4F-ICP-MS, with detection of 2 nm particles being possible rather than 20 nm as obtained using single particle ICP-MS. The single particle approach was, however, capable of differentiating between the dissolved, ionic Ag signal and nanoparticulate Ag which the A4F-ICP-MS was not. The dissolved Ag would manifest itself as an increase in the number of low intensity pulses. The dynamic range for single particle-ICP-MS is limited in that if too many particles are present, more than one will be detected at any instant. This problem is not suffered by the A4F-ICP-MS approach. Finally, the potential of the two techniques to determine more than one analyte was compared. The A4F-ICP-MS was very capable of this but the single particle approach was not.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The single particle approach to analysing <span class="italic">nanoparticles presents many challenges and must be optimized carefully</span>. Reed <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> have produced a paper entitled “overcoming challenges in analysis of polydisperse-metal-containing nanoparticles by single particle inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry”. These workers used zinc oxide, cerium oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles as well as silver nanowires during their study. At the sub-ppb detection required, the zinc oxide particles dissolved and hence the single particle approach was unsuccessful. However, the other three materials were determined successfully. Other factors that have to be taken into account to obtain a successful analysis include: the percentage of metal in each nanoparticle, the abundance of each isotope used and the possibility of mass interferences. For instance, the Ce content represents over 80% of cerium oxide. This means that it would potentially give a higher signal than the Ti, which represents only 60% of titanium dioxide. Similarly, the Ag content of silver nanowires is close to 100% and therefore, easily gives signals above background levels. The Ce signal is far higher for the <small><sup>140</sup></small>Ce than for any other isotope, simply because its abundance is 88.48%. However, for the Ti determination, the more abundant isotopes cannot be used because they suffer from interferences and so an isotope (<small><sup>49</sup></small>Ti) that has an abundance of only 5.41% was used. A 10 ms dwell time was sufficiently low to minimize the possibility of particle coincidence. However, the authors did note that this particle coincidence may be minimized relatively more easily in standard solutions where the particle size distribution is closely controlled than in “real” samples where they are usually much more diverse. The results obtained using the single particle approach were compared with those obtained using sedimentation field flow fractionation (FFF) and were in good agreement. For the titanium dioxide nanoparticles, the single particle approach yielded a modal diameter of 162 nm whereas the sedimentation FFF modal diameter was closer to 122 nm. The shape of the distribution was, however, similar for both techniques. Comparison of data obtained using a combination of multiple analyses of dilute solutions with those obtained using a single analysis at higher concentration enabled discrimination between coincidence and polydispersity.</p>

Both monodisperse and polydisperse silver nanoparticles of diameter 20–100 nm were introduced. The authors demonstrated that single 30 nm nanoparticles could be detected using system one, whereas systems two and three could detect 20 nm particles.

If the measured intensity was greater than five times the standard deviation of the whole data set, then the signal was attributed to that of a particle. The smallest particle size that could be detected was 20 nm and this was attributed to the overlap of particle events and the signal from and dissolved ions. At such low concentrations the noise increases for both signals effectively making them a single event. The optimal dwell time for particles in the 40 to 80 nm range was 5 ms. The lowest measurable number concentration was limited by the relative frequency of erroneously identified particle events. This number could be reduced by acquiring more data points.

          <span>There are increasing concerns over the illicit production and trafficking of nuclear materials. One of the most valuable approaches to combating this is the <span class="italic">chronometric investigation (age-dating) of materials</span>. A beginner's guide to uranium chronometry in nuclear materials and safeguards was presented by Stanley.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit206"><sup><span class="sup_ref">206</span></sup></a> This author stated that a well-designed chronometric scheme may provide information on a sample's composition, enrichment history and the time lapsed since its last purification. This beginner's guide provided the fundamental concepts of uranium chronometry along with several unique concerns and recent applications. Since this is an expanding area of research, several areas of potential future development were also discussed.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Marin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit207"><sup><span class="sup_ref">207</span></sup></a> used LA–SF–ICP-MS for the determination of U isotope ratios in a highly enriched uranium sample. The measurements were improved by optimization of RF power, laser beam diameter, defocusing of the laser beam, laser energy, laser energy density, auxiliary gas and sample gas. The measurements were performed using continuous ablation with low energy density and defocussing since these provided optimal signal stability. A <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratio of 16.36 ± 0.15 was obtained with a precision of 1.12% RSD. The results were compared with those obtained during a laboratory round robin and differed from the average ratio by 0.46%. Comparison with the value assigned by the manufacturer of the material indicated a difference of 0.41%. The data were therefore in sufficiently good agreement for the authors to conclude that LA-ICP-MS using a SF instrument offers a rapid and accurate alternative for the determination of U isotope ratios. The procedure has the advantage of not requiring sample preparation, using the minimum of sample and hence preserving sample integrity.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Kraiem <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit208"><sup><span class="sup_ref">208</span></sup></a> reported the development of <span class="italic">single particle uranium oxide reference materials</span> with certified values for U content and for isotope ratios. The material was prepared at the European Commission's Institute for Transuranium Elements in Karlsruhe, using an aerosol generation technique developed in-house (the method was discussed in the paper). The paper also described the analysis of the mono-dispersed, micron-sized particles of uranium oxide using ID-TIMS. Although some agglomerates were formed during the generation process, it was only the single particles that were used during the analysis. Single particles (or a maximum of seven) were placed on a pre-degassed and carburized rhenium filament using a micromanipulator. The particles strongly adhered to the filament without the need for a fixing agent and this was important since any additional materials (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a fixative) may have U contamination and could potentially have distorted the isotope ratios. The single particles were analysed alternately with certified solutions. A spike concentration of 2.2 pg μL<small><sup>−1 233</sup></small>U prepared from the reference material IRMM-058 was used and this was introduced using a micropipette in volumes of between 1 and 4 μL, depending on the number of particles introduced per filament. The study demonstrated a clear correlation between the particle volume and the U mass and that the mass could be measured accurately with a relative expanded uncertainty of approximately 10% (where the coverage factor was <span class="italic">k</span> = 2). The production of such materials would be directly applicable for analyses using TIMS, SIMS, LA-ICP-MS. It was noted, however, that some batches of sample had voids in the particles. This was concluded because although the particles were the same size as others, there was significantly less U present. The particles with voids could readily be identified using SEM and so could be removed.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">
            <span class="italic">Plutonium dioxide particles may also be used as a quality control measure</span> for safeguards purposes. Shinonaga <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209</span></sup></a> first used a chemical separation of americium and then produced such particles using an atomizer system on the New Brunswick Laboratory material CRM-136 solution. The highest density of the size distribution of 312 particles on a selected impactor stage was 0.7 to 0.8 μm. Analysis of the particles using TIMS, ICP-MS and alpha spectrometry enabled the isotopic composition of Pu and U and amount of Am to be estimated. The isotopic composition was, within uncertainty, in agreement with expected values which had been derived from the decay correction of the Pu isotopes in the original solution. The elemental ratio of Am to Pu was determined on the 317th and 674th day after the Am separation. Analysis of single particles using micro-Raman-scanning electron microscopy with EDX detection indicated that the particles produced were plutonium dioxide. However, the authors did note that their initial attempts to measure the density of two single particles provided results with a spread of values accompanied by a large uncertainty.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">The first of the techniques to be discussed will be XRF. <span class="italic">Several versions of XRF</span> have been employed to analyse nuclear materials. Sato <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit210"><sup><span class="sup_ref">210</span></sup></a> analysed remelted Zircaloy cladding material. The major elements (Cr, Fe, Ni, Sn and Zr) were determined using EDXRF whereas the Hf and contaminants were determined using WDXRF. The remelted material had elevated Cu, Fe and Cr levels when compared with the original material. This was attributed to the contamination from iron scraps (for the Fe and Cr) whereas the excess Cu was thought to originate from contact of the molten Zircaloy droplets with the copper crucible. A TXRF technique was applied by Dhara <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> for the determination of Cl in nuclear fuel materials such as U<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>8</sub></small>, Pu alloys, PuO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and (U,Pu)C. Sample (500 mg) was weighed into a quartz boat which was then placed in a pyrohydrolysis unit. The use of this unit was described in the paper and a schematic diagram was given. Essentially, a mixture of argon and oxygen containing water was passed into the apparatus and the system was heated to 900 °C. The sample breaks down and volatile components, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> B, Cl, F and S, were liberated and transported by the gas flow through a condenser unit and collected in 5 mM NaOH. After dilution to 25 mL and the addition of a Co internal standard, aliquots (30 μL) of the sample was analysed using TXRF. The Cl Kα line at 2.622 keV was used to excite the analyte and the fluorescence was measured using a Si(Li) detector. The sample mass, gas flow rates, pyrolysis temperature and other parameters were all optimized. Precision was quite poor (27% RSD) when the TXRF determination was undertaken in an air atmosphere. This could, however, be improved to 8% RSD if He was used instead. Data obtained using pyrohydrolysis–TXRF were compared with those obtained using ion chromatography and were in reasonable agreement, with the TXRF–ion chromatography concentration data having a ratio of between 0.68 and 1.17. The same research group used synchrotron-induced EDXRF to determine Th and U in mixed uranium-thorium oxide pellets.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit212"><sup><span class="sup_ref">212</span></sup></a> The uranium and thorium oxides were mixed in varying ratios such that the U content ranged from 0 to 85%. A fixed amount of Y in the form of yttrium oxide was added as an internal standard and boric acid was added to give a final mass of the mixed material of 2.5 g. The analytes were determined at the U Lα, Th Lα and Y Kα lines respectively. Precision of the determinations was 0.3% RSD for U and 0.2% RSD for Th. The results obtained deviated from the expected amount by 1 and 0.9% for U and Th, respectively.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Other workers have <span class="italic">used ICP-OES to analyse nuclear materials</span>. The trace components of uranium zirconium alloy were determined using ICP-OES by Sengupta <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> who digested the material using nitric acid and then selectively extracted the matrix components into an organic phase comprising 30% tributyl phosphate and carbon tetrachloride. The analytes were then determined in the raffinate. The optimal acid concentration was 7 M. Separation of the matrix components was necessary because they are both very line rich, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> their presence at an appreciable concentration could interfere with the determination of the analytes. A systematic study of the potential interference posed by these metals on the determination of the analytes (Al, B, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Dy, Eu, Fe, Gd, Mn, Na, Ni, Sm and Zn) was undertaken and 10 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> U and 1000 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Zr could be tolerated. Five successive extractions were required to ensure that sufficient matrix components were removed. The same research group also published a paper that discussed the development of the methodology for the determination of Am and Th using ICP-OES and their inter-element effects.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> Two emission lines for Am were identified: 283.236 and 408.930 nm providing LOD of 5 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 11 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. However, the 283.236 nm line does suffer from a significant interference by high concentrations of thorium. Three thorium lines were also identified (283.273, 283.730 and 401.913 nm). The first and last had similar LOD (18 and 13 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), but the 283.730 nm line was less impressive, with a LOD of 60 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The authors also discovered that even a small amount of Am contributes significantly to the Th signal at 283.242 nm. Overall, it was concluded that in the presence of Am, Th should be determined using the 401.930 nm line.

This is presumably because LIBS provides the capability of “standoff” analysis (thereby decreasing the exposure of the analyst to potentially harmful samples), is readily automated, and requires only small sample amounts with minimal damage, <span class="italic">etc.</span> These were certainly some of the advantages listed in a paper by Martin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit215"><sup><span class="sup_ref">215</span></sup></a> who explored its use for the analysis of nuclear materials and <span class="italic">in situ</span> applications. These authors used a frequency doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) with 50 mJ per pulse energy to determine LOD for Cs and Sr (common nuclear fission products) as well as Ce (used as a surrogate for plutonium in laboratory studies) that had been spiked at different concentrations in calcium carbonate and carbon pellets. The method of pellet preparation was given in the paper and the authors also studied the sampling errors, reproducibility and accuracy of the measurements. Light emitted from the sample was transmitted <span class="italic">via</span> a fiber optic to an echelle spectrometer that covered the wavelength range of 200 to 950 nm and an intensified CCD detector. The spectra obtained from the samples were interrogated using the chemometric techniques of PCA and projection to latent structures. These chemometric techniques enabled the measurements to be made quantitative.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A feasibility study of <span class="italic">fusion vessel inner wall chemical analysis using LIBS</span> was undertaken by Almaviva <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a> The LIBS system was described in detail and consisted of a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm that could deliver 1 J of energy in a 8 ns pulse at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The laser head was positioned 220 cm from the sample surface and the laser beam was focused using a lens. Operating at 645 mJ the laser produced a crater with an area of 2.6 × 10<small><sup>−2</sup></small> cm, meaning that a fluence of approximately 25 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> was obtained. Light produced was transmitted to the spectrometer by a bundle of 12 fibre optics and some lenses. The spectrometer itself comprised three different gratings with 1200, 2400 and 3600 grooves mm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and had a resolution of approximately 0.01 nm at 500 nm. The detector was an intensified CCD that had a minimum gating time of 10 ns. The effects of time delay and laser fluence on the LIBS sensitivity at reduced pressure were examined. It was possible to detect thin interfaces on different materials demonstrating that it would be possible to monitor the erosion of the surface and deposition of impurities.

            <span class="italic">Resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS)</span> is regarded as being one of the most sensitive and selective techniques for the determination of long-lived radionuclides. The research group at Mainz has produced three papers of interest during this review period. In one, by Trautmann and Wendt,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit218"><sup><span class="sup_ref">218</span></sup></a> the potential of RIMS for determining long-lived Pu and Np isotopes, including isotope ratio measurements, was determined. In addition, the first ionization potentials of 10 actinide elements were determined using the photothreshold method. Only 10<small><sup>12</sup></small> atoms were required for these measurements. This paper also described the investigation of short-lived fission products. For these studies, a gas jet and its combination with a thermochromatographic separation and a continuous solvent extraction technique were used. The paper discussed all of the examples in detail. A second paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit219"><sup><span class="sup_ref">219</span></sup></a> discussed the ultra-trace determination of Tc. The state of the art and the specifications of RIMS-based detection of Tc leading to detection at 3 × 10<small><sup>4</sup></small> atoms level were reported. The third paper in the series discussed the detection of Pu at ultra-trace quantities. According to the authors, the method enabled the unambiguous identification and individual quantification of both <small><sup>238</sup></small>Pu and <small><sup>241</sup></small>Pu. These isotopes are, of course, of relevance for the dating of radiogenic samples. Since the ionization is selective to individual elements, the presence of large quantities of <small><sup>241</sup></small>Am and <small><sup>238</sup></small>U did not cause isobaric interferences. Again, LOD were of the order of 10<small><sup>4</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> atoms.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There has been an upsurge in the number of <span class="italic">accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)</span> papers published during this review period. In one paper, Lu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit220"><sup><span class="sup_ref">220</span></sup></a> reported their attempts to separate the <small><sup>93</sup></small>Zr–<small><sup>93</sup></small>Nb isobar so that <small><sup>93</sup></small>Zr may be determined accurately using AMS so that it may be used as a tracer in hydrological and radioactive waste studies. Results of the first experiments, involving the use of a combination of a gas-filled magnet with a position-sensitive parallel grid avalanche counter and a gas ionization chamber in the magnet's focal plane, were reported. Although the experiment was not entirely successful, sufficient progress was made to give reassurance that the separation may be possible. Further modifications include the use of a more powerful magnet, the reduction of the Nb and the further optimization of the beam energy and the gas pressure in the gas-filled magnet.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The final two papers to be discussed in this section describe <span class="italic">speciation analysis</span>. Stobener <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit221"><sup><span class="sup_ref">221</span></sup></a> developed a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-ICP-MS technique for the redox speciation analysis of Np. The CE and ICP-MS coupling was <span class="italic">via</span> a commercial low flow nebulizer and a Scott-type spray chamber. The CE separated Np<small><sup>IV</sup></small> and Np<small><sup>V</sup></small>, which are the only oxidation states that are stable in the environment. Limits of detection were 1 × 10<small><sup>−9</sup></small> and 5 × 10<small><sup>−10</sup></small> mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Np(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) and Np(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) respectively, which were sufficiently low to be suitable for measurement of the analytes in samples from a nuclear waste repository. A linear calibration range spanning three orders of magnitude (10<small><sup>−9</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) was obtained for both species. The method was applied to the speciation analysis of Np left in solution after interaction of 5 × 10<small><sup>−7</sup></small> mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Np(<span class="small_caps">V</span>) with Opalinus clay. Under oxidizing conditions, a Np sorption of 31% occurred and all of the Np remaining in solution was in the (V) state. A second experiment in which the Np was mixed with Fe<small><sup>2+</sup></small> and then Opalinus clay led to complete sorption. After desorption using perchloric acid, the Np was present in both the (IV) and (V) states. The other paper of interest in this section was prepared by Eichler <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit222"><sup><span class="sup_ref">222</span></sup></a> who used HPLC-ICP-MS to monitor the mobility of Se in engineering barriers of stored nuclear waste. Since <small><sup>79</sup></small>Se is a decay product of <small><sup>238</sup></small>U, it is necessary to predict its behavior in the bentonite barriers. The inter-conversions of non-radioactive Se species were studied in aqueous suspensions of bentonite at various pH using HPLC with both reversed phase and anion exchange columns. The chromatographic parameters were optimized to improve the separation of the species. In alkaline medium and in the presence of bentonite, some selenite was oxidized to selenate within two weeks. The retention of selenate in the barrier is lower than that of selenite and therefore it was concluded that Se could easily spread.</p>

        <span>An <span class="italic">overview</span> (with 111 references) <span class="italic">of the use of XRF in the analysis of cultural heritage artefacts</span> was given by Musilek <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> The overview presented a brief description of the instrumentation and went on to discuss applications. Materials covered in the review included ceramics, glasses, paintings and frescos, manuscripts, drawings and prints, metals and other materials such as deposits on buildings <span class="italic">etc.</span> Although the paper is clearly not a comprehensive review, it does provide the reader with an indication of the areas that may be addressed using the different XRF-based techniques and gives many relevant references. A brief description of the work undertaken at the authors' institute was also presented.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Ceramics are usually resistant to heat and are often relatively inert meaning that very harsh conditions are usually required for their dissolution. Consequently, many of the methods used for their analysis have taken advantage of the techniques that are capable of <span class="italic">analysing solid samples directly</span>. This means that techniques that utilise lasers and X-ray-based methods are the most common. These will be discussed in this section of the review. It should be noted that a significant number of papers describing the preparation of bio-ceramic materials have been published. However, the focus of these papers was almost entirely on the material itself rather than the analysis. They have, therefore, not been reviewed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A new multi-element analysis technique based on <span class="italic">laser-excited atomic fluorescence</span> was discussed by Cai <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit232"><sup><span class="sup_ref">232</span></sup></a> The authors managed to induce numerous analytes to fluoresce even though only one excitation wavelength (193 nm) was used. This was only possible if the analytes were embedded in a dense plume, such as that produced during pulsed laser ablation. Full details were given in the paper as was an explanation of the mechanism. Numerous applications were presented including the analysis of metals, plastics, ceramics and their composites. Impressive LODs (ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range) were obtained meaning that absolute amounts at the atto-mole level could be determined. The procedure was, therefore, regarded as being non-sample destructive.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Hall effect thrusters are promising electric propulsion devices that enable geostationary satellites to maintain their station. The main limiting factor of their lifespan is the erosion of the annular channel's ceramic walls caused by energetic xenon impacting on it. An interesting <span class="italic">application of LIBS</span> was discussed by Balika <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233</span></sup></a> who described the analysis of the ceramic wall to monitor the erosion process whilst the thruster was in operation. The full set-up was described and a schematic diagram was given in the paper. Briefly, the thruster was placed in a vacuum chamber and Xe gas introduced at a rate of 5 mg s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm, with pulses of 10 ns duration and energy in the 10 to 80 mJ range provided a beam spot 300 μm in diameter. This was focussed <span class="italic">via</span> a lens and a slit machined in the outer wall onto the inner ceramic wall surface. A laser pulse rate of 10 Hz was used and the number of pulses used was between 50 and 100. The light emitted was transmitted <span class="italic">via</span> a fiber optic to a spectrometer and an intensified CCD camera detector. The amount of material ablated had to be determined so that a direct correlation between mass and the optical signal could be obtained. This was achieved off-line using both a mechanical contact profilometer and an optical profilometer. Once the correlation (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a calibration) had been made, it was possible to use the LIBS system remotely to monitor the degradation of the ceramic wall.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Some ceramics are used in the electronics industry. Several papers have, therefore, been published that used techniques capable of <span class="italic">surface analysis or depth-profiling</span> to determine the diffusion properties of analytes. Several of these papers will have been discussed elsewhere in the review, but it is worth noting some here for completeness. Idris <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> used SIMS to monitor the effects of both temperature (between 1073 and 1673 K) and oxygen activity on the segregation on the surface and near surface layers of yttria stabilized zirconia. The effect of oxygen was significant over the temperature range 1073–1473 K with the maximum enrichment of Y being observed at 1273 K. Several techniques including SIMS, X-ray photoelectron core level spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were used by Lysaght <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit235"><sup><span class="sup_ref">235</span></sup></a> to monitor the Al and N diffusion in hafnium dioxide and its interface with the silicon substrate in (001) Si–SiO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>–2 nm HfO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–1 nm AlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> film structures. Diffusion of the Al was observed from the AlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> cap layer deposited on annealed and unannealed hafnium dioxide following annealing in nitrogen and at an ambient temperature in ammonia. The authors decoupled the effects of nitrogen from the thermal reactions alone by annealing in both nitrogen and ammonia. Causal variations in the hafnium dioxide micro-structure combined with the dependence of Al and N diffusion on initial hafnium dioxide conditions were presented with respect to anneal temperature.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Although the majority of applications utilized solid sampling methods, some have managed to undertake a dissolution process prior to analysis. One such example was described by Tagle <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit236"><sup><span class="sup_ref">236</span></sup></a> who determined metal impurities in advanced lead zirconate titanate ceramics using a <span class="italic">microwave-assisted acid dissolution</span> prior to ICP-OES analysis of the digests. Two microwave digestion methods were compared. Both used 0.25 g of pulverized material, but one used a mixture of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids and the other a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids plus hydrogen peroxide. Both then underwent the same microwave assisted dissolution program, followed by addition of perchloric acid, evaporation and then dilution to 50 mL using 5% nitric acid. The protocol using hydrochloric acid provided a very low yield of Pb (approximately 40%) and this was attributed to the precipitation of PbCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The recoveries of the other major elements were in good agreement with those obtained using the nitric acid dissolution procedure. The nitric acid digestion procedure was, therefore, adopted for subsequent experiments, even though the levels of Sr, Ti and Zr were between 4 and 9% lower than the expected values. A suite of trace impurities (13 analytes) was then determined in the digests. The analysis stage was also optimized, with nebulizer flow rate and plasma power being of highest importance in obtaining robust plasma conditions and decreasing matrix effects. Precision for the analytes ranged from 3 to 13% whilst spiking experiments led to recoveries of between 90 and 110%. The LOD were very variable with the best being 0.004 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Mn) and the worst 10 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for Fe).</p>

Although the aim is to cause no damage to the samples, the interaction of the ion beam with the sample does cause some changes. This paper attempted to establish the limits so that damage is minimal or that the analysis is viable in terms of the cost benefit ratio. Interaction of the ion beam with the sample may cause discoloration, heating, sputtering of the surface, displacement of atoms in the sample, changes in the composition arising from implantation of new species produced by nuclear reactions and changes in microscopic structures (because of the formation of new phases). Each of these potential problems was discussed in the paper.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Some studies are worth discussing in more detail. Bardelli <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit238"><sup><span class="sup_ref">238</span></sup></a> used several <span class="italic">synchrotron-based X-ray techniques</span> to elucidate the Fe speciation in samples of ancient Attic pottery from the Gioiosa Guardia archaeological site in the Strait of Messina. The Fe speciation analysis was undertaken using PCA and least-squares fitting procedures applied to the data obtained from the near edge part of the absorption spectra (XANES). Details of the local structure around the Fe sites was achieved using the extended part of the spectra; the technique known as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The red pigments were comprised of an admixture of hematite or maghemite (Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>) and magnetite (Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>). Different ratios of the material accounted for the dark and lighter coloured areas on the samples. The data obtained in this paper were complementary to those obtained previously using INAA, FTIR and time of flight neutron diffraction. A similar study by Figueiredo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239</span></sup></a> used XANES to study the Co speciation in the blue and white glazes of 16th and 17th century Chinese porcelains.

Samples from two sites were analysed. The ones from Coimbra comprised faiences and tiles, whereas those from Lisbon were only tiles. Such pieces contain three parts to their structure: the bulk ceramic, the glaze and the surface decoration. The decoration and glaze are not easy to investigate because of the high degree of heterogeneity resulting from the mixing procedures and the firing temperatures. The extent to which the decoration diffuses into the glaze is dependent on their compositions. The decoration was analysed using the high resolution instrumentation and the blue samples were high in Co, the purple ones contained significant amounts of Mn, the yellow ones contained Sb and the green ones Cu. The glaze contained Pb whereas the body of the ceramic often contained significant amounts of Fe. A difference was observed between faiences and tiles, with the glaze in the former being typically 150 to 200 μm thick whereas the tiles' glaze was typically 350 to 400 μm thick. The samples from Lisbon had a higher intake of the pigment in the glaze than those from Coimbra.</p>

        <span>The development of <span class="italic">techniques for the characterisation of thin films</span> continues to be a subject of research in the current review period. Advances are summarised in this section only from those publications that focus specifically on analytical development, or provide insights in relation to comparative performance in the increasingly prevalent multi-technique approach to the characterisation of these materials. In some cases, thin films are deposited on glass substrates. Where the work relates to the characterisation of the film or its relationship with the substrate it is described in this section. Developments in the characterisation of glasses are presented in Section 3.3 of this review.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A six page review of the use of LIBS for the <span class="italic">surface analysis of materials</span> has been published by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit261"><sup><span class="sup_ref">261</span></sup></a> Subjects covered include theory, instrumentation, and features of the technique such as elemental distribution and depth profiling. The factors that affect analytical performance such as the selection of the ambient gas and operating pressure, the pulse energy and distribution of the laser beam are also explored. The authors identify the key advantages of LIBS in terms of the ability to scan a large area of sample, and the capacity to analyse conducting and non-conducting samples. Applications in electronic materials, semiconductors and metallurgy are cited.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There have been many reports during the period under review of the use of <span class="italic">multiple techniques in the characterisation of thin film materials</span>. For example, the outcome of an interlaboratory comparison of surface analysis techniques for the characterisation of Fe–Ni alloy thin films has been published by Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit262"><sup><span class="sup_ref">262</span></sup></a> This work was carried out under the auspices of Surface Analysis Working Group of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance by four National Metrology Institutes and one Designated Institute. Four laboratories used XPS and one used Auger Electron Spectroscopy for the analysis. Unsurprisingly, it was shown that if quantification was carried out using relative sensitivity factors for Fe and Ni derived from an alloy reference sample, the results obtained were more accurate than if pure Fe and Ni films were used for the same purpose. However, it was noted that the uncertainty budget for the measured chemical composition of the Fe–Ni alloy film on this basis was dominated by the uncertainty of the composition of a reference specimen previously analysed by ICP-MS. The individual expanded uncertainties for the participating laboratories were given in the range 2.88 to 3.40 atomic %.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The development of <span class="italic">analytical techniques for investigating the growth of novel material structures</span> remains an area of significant activity.

The application of Auger electron spectroscopy and particularly SIMS depth profiling demonstrated that this transformation had the effect of creating pores at the Ti(C, N) interface, thereby causing a lowering of interfacial strength. The growth of In–Ga–N type films on quartz glass substrates has been investigated using SIMS, XPS and XRD.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> The extent of oxygen contamination and the chemical states of the films were studied using XPS while the distribution profile of O in the films was investigated using SIMS.

          <span>A calibration-free method for the compositional analysis of an indium-tin-oxide material has been reported using <span class="italic">laser induced breakdown spectroscopy</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> Indium emission was observed at three different wavelengths (325.609, 410.177 and 451.131 nm) and four Sn lines (283.999, 286.333, 317.502 and 326.234 nm) were used for measurements. As might be anticipated, it was reported that the intensity of emission signals for In and Sn were related proportionately to the applied laser energy but that the degree of enhancement observed was greater for In than for Sn. This was attributed to differences in energy levels of the transitions monitored. It was found that the optimal conditions for the analysis involved the use of a 20 mJ laser pulse (equivalent to a plasma temperature of 5400 K) followed by a subsequent 2 to 4 μs delay prior to the acquisition of spectral data. Under these conditions the content of In and Sn in the oxide material was reported to be 30 and 32% respectively. Also in this vein, the elemental analysis of a thin (1.23 μm) copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) absorption layer has been carried out using LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> The absorption layer was deposited by co-evaporation on the surface of a Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrate. Under optimum analytical conditions, good calibration linearity was achieved for the Ga–In ratio when compared with equivalent data measured using XRF and ICP-OES. (see also Section 3.2.3.1 of this review). The LIBS technique has also been used in the characterisation of thin Cu films (1 μm) on soda lime glass substrates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit268"><sup><span class="sup_ref">268</span></sup></a> A nanosecond Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was used to ablate material with a notional spatial resolution of 50 μm. It was found that when a supporting Mo layer was employed the characteristics of the ablation craters produced in the sample were completely different to those without this layer present. It was further observed that the electron densities from the plasma, calculated using the measured LIBS spectra, were lower by as much as a factor of four when the Mo supporting layer was employed. The effect was considered to result from a matrix interference arising from ionisation of Na atoms that had diffused into the Mo sub-film.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the analyte pre-peak pulse time region during the sputtering process to make analytical measurements. In this phase of the cycle, the analyte ion concentrations peak after the initial sputtering caused by each GD pulse. It was anticipated that this approach would improve the resolution of the depth profile analysis and at the same time minimise spectral interferences.

The ICP instrument utilised an echelle polychromator with tow segmented array CCDs for uv and visible spectrum measurement, and the plasma was viewed in an axial configuration. It was noted, unsurprisingly, that larger sample masses sizes (400–500 ng) were required for ICP-OES measurement and that the ablation spot sizes were also larger (100 μm) than required for ICP-MS analysis (40–60 μm). A FGS 1 reference material (BKA Forensic Science Unit, Wiesbaden, Germany) was used as the single point calibration standard for the method and NIST SRM 1831 run every two hours to check for instrumental drift.

Chenakin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit321"><sup><span class="sup_ref">321</span></sup></a> discussed the surface characterisation of aluminovanadate oxide catalyst precursors using a combination of XPS and TOF-SIMS.

Powdered samples were pressed into indium film to form a uniform layer and loaded into a combined XPS-TOF-SIMS instrument at 8.1 × 10<small><sup>−10</sup></small> mbar base pressure. For XPS, non-monochromatic Mg K<small><sub>α</sub></small> radiation of 150 W operating power was employed. The static TOF-SIMS analysis was carried out using a pulsing beam of Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions and positive secondary ions of mass up to 400 amu were extracted at 1400 V. Changes in the binding energy separations (ΔBE) between the O 1s and Al 2p peaks, and the O 1s and V 2p<small><sub>3/2</sub></small> peaks were used to study the surface chemical environment, as this parameter was independent of surface charge. The surface Al of dried samples had an increasing tendency to form hydroxide–oxohydroxides at higher pH. The major oxidation state of V was +5, although an appreciable amount of V<small><sup>4+</sup></small> species was also present together with hydroxylated V. After calcination the relative fraction of reduced V<small><sup>4+</sup></small> species increased, the extent of hydroxylation of both Al and V decreased and the Al–O and V–O bond strengths changed, giving rise to a modification of the valence band electronic structure. Comparison of SIMS peak ratios showed that a number of interesting processes occurred. The V<small><sup>+</sup></small>/Al<small><sup>+</sup></small> ratio indicated that the surface V concentration of dried catalysts was depleted compared with that of the bulk, with enrichment of V at the surface upon calcination. With increasing pH, formation of aluminium hydroxides–oxohydroxide occurred in preference to vanadium hydroxide, indicated by the AlOH<small><sup>+</sup></small>/VOH<small><sup>+</sup></small> ratio.
