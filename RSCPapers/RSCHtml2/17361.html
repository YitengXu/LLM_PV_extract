This ASU review deals with all aspects of the analytical atomic spectrometry speciation methods developed for: the determination of oxidation states; organometallic compounds; coordination compounds; metal and heteroatom-containing biomolecules, including metalloproteins, proteins, peptides and amino acids; and the use of metal-tagging to facilitate detection <span class="italic">via</span> atomic spectrometry. The review does not cover fractionation, which is sometimes termed operationally defined speciation. As with all ASU reviews the focus of the research reviewed includes those methods that incorporate atomic spectrometry as the measurement technique. However, because speciation analysis is inherently focused on the relationship between the metal(loid) atom and the organic moiety it is bound to, or incorporated within, atomic spectrometry alone cannot be the sole analytical approach of interest. For this reason molecular detection techniques are also included where they have provided a complementary approach to speciation analysis. As in previous years, As speciation continues to dominate the current literature with a significant number of publications concerning Hg and Se speciation and ‘biomolecules’, in which category a number of papers covered in the Se section could also belong. The number of elements covered in these updates also continues to rise with speciation analysis of over 20 elements reported this year.</p></div><hr/>
    
      
      <h2 id="sect326"><span class="a_heading">1 Topical reviews</span></h2>
      <span>This latest update adds to that from last year<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> and complements other reviews<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2–6</span></sup></a> of analytical techniques in the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates. Two books from the same publisher contain <span class="italic">chapters concerned with elemental speciation</span>. The first entitled ‘Inorganic Trace Analytics: Trace element analysis and speciation’ is divided into three sections containing a total of 10 chapters, each of which is written by a small number of expert practitioners.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> Part 1 covers sample preparation and analytical techniques; part 2 contains five chapters each of which deals with a particular application area, environment, food, biological, forensic and industrial; whilst part 3 is entitled “Inorganic and bioinorganic speciation analysis at trace level”. The three chapters in this section are entitled (a) quality of results in trace element and speciation analysis, (b) sample pre-treatment for trace speciation analysis, and (c) solid-phase extraction in fractionation of trace elements. The second book “Handbook of Rare Earth Elements: Analytics”, again a collection of chapters written by various experts, contains 14 chapters.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> However, in this case only one of them is related to speciation analysis, namely ‘analysis and speciation of lanthanoids’, which would appear to deal only with compounds of Gd (contrast agents). It appears from the publisher’s website that individual chapters of both books can be purchased separately and downloaded as files in portable document format.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">As has been the pattern in recent review periods, <span class="italic">numerous reviews of various aspects of elemental speciation</span> have appeared in the peer reviewed literature. These reviews can be broadly classified according to the following, the atomic spectrometry technique, the separation technique, the sample material, the analytes, or various combinations thereof.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Seven review articles deal with aspects of the <span class="italic">measurement of metal species in biological materials or systems</span>. Professor H. Haraguchi has surveyed developments in the field since he coined the term ‘metallomics’ in 2004.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> The review is somewhat selective as only 67 articles are cited (titles are provided). He concludes that metallomics has been developing as both an interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary field together with a variety of biometal sciences, as well as with genomics and proteomics. He proposes that to accelerate the development of metallomics, the organization of a scientific platform is needed so that information and technological developments can be shared among the practitioners of a number of mission-oriented sciences such as medicine, pharmacy, toxicology, food and nutrition. A prediction is made that elemental analysis of single-cells and the imaging of cells and organs will be the major research fields in the next decade, together with studies in the cell biology of metals from multi-elemental aspects, molecular and genetic features of various metals, and inorganic drug design for chemotherapy. The imaging-of-metals theme is covered in a more detailed review by Ackerman <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> They cite 212 articles (titles are not given) to highlight the power of complementary analytical techniques to map total metal pools and identify subsets that are (a) static and tightly bound or (b) dynamic and weakly bound. The reviewers focus on the two most abundant redox-active transition metals in living systems: Cu and Fe, both of which have been traditionally studied in bioinorganic chemistry as static cofactors tightly bound by metallochaperones and buried in protein active sites to protect cells against oxidative stress but which are now are emerging as dynamic transition metal signals that can reversibly affect the function of proteins in allosteric regions outside active sites. A significant portion of the review is devoted to the application of molecular probes (synthetic small-molecule reagents), whose use is viewed as a crucial complement to the atomic spectrometry techniques, such as LA-ICP-MS and various X-ray absorption spectrometries. The reviewers conclude that open collaboration between chemistry and biology, in which the disparate communities work together to evaluate the best chemical imaging tools for a given biological system, is key to progress. One tool that features prominently in such studies is LA-ICP-MS for which Pozebon <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> have updated their earlier 2014 review. The key advances identified are fast wash-out ablation cells, calibration strategies (such as ink printing and dried-droplets), mapping of elemental distribution in animal, human and plant tissues, nanoparticle uptake, and protein and single cell analysis. Some 11-pages of the review (about 50% of the total) are occupied by a summary table of 70 articles with three columns: element, sample and remarks. The contents of the articles are also discussed in the text along with citations to another 70 or so, for a total of 142 references, whose titles are not given. The reviewers conclude that improvements in a number of areas are needed, including low dispersion ablation cells, optimal laser parameters, high sample transport, complete aerosol ionization with low diffusion inside the ICP, higher ion beam transmission to the detector and simultaneous detection technology. They also highlight the need for the provision of three-dimensional information. The application of ICP-MS-based techniques for the determination of trace elements and their species in cells has been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> In addition to LA, the review (60 references without titles) includes recent developments in multi-dimensional chromatograph and electrophoresis combined with ICP-MS and highlights the improved LODs that are obtained from the development of chip-based micro-extraction techniques. However, the reviewers conclude that LOD values are not yet good enough for the analysis of single cells and that further developments in miniature sample preparation and separation are needed to obtain speciation information. They also consider that further developments in applications of tagging (of both biomolecules and cells) for quantification by ICP-MS are needed. It is suggested that future developments would include more universal and robust elemental tagging strategies, amplification strategies to overcome current LOD values, and methods with suitable elemental tags for multi-cell lines. The use of exogenous tags for the quantitative determination of biomolecules has also been comprehensively reviewed (245 references with titles).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> The reviewers identify four major topics: applications of HPLC-ICP-MS in the absolute/relative quantification of proteins with exogenous tags, applications of ICP-MS in immunoassays with exogenous tags, applications of LA-ICP-MS with exogenous tags, and applications of ICP-MS in the quantification of nucleic acids with exogenous tags. Each of these topics is summarised in a table. The review features detailed tutorial introductions to the various topics, including an explanation of the benefits and advantages of ICP-MS. The reviewers are perhaps a bit optimistic in considering that responses are independent of the compound and the matrix. They conclude that further research is needed in a number of areas, pointing out that although very low LOD values can be obtained, accurate quantification of low abundance proteins is still a challenge. They also call for the development of new signal amplification techniques and increases in the speed of analysis. They indicate that further applications at both the “macroscopic and microcosmic” scales are needed, pointing out that, although mass cytometry has been developed for the single cell analysis, ICP-MS-based assays have not yet been developed for smaller parts of the organism, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. They consider that ICP-MS based procedures will find application alongside techniques such as luminescence imaging and molecular MS in the accurate diagnosis of disease. Sample pre-treatment procedures for the elemental speciation in biological materials by methods involving ICP-MS have been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> The review cites 219 references over the past 10 years and is somewhat selective in that methods in which LC separations are implemented are only briefly mentioned; the main focus of the review is on liquid and solid-phase micro-extractions, and chip-based manifolds that can be coupled to ICP-MS instrumentation. The former included various miniaturised LLE procedures as well as matrix solid phase dispersion. In addition to SPME on fibres, capillary microextraction and stir-bar methods are reviewed. A considerable portion of the review is devoted to on-chip procedures including CE, though as the reviewers point out, there are no applications reported for biological samples. They conclude that there is currently a shortage of calibration standards and CRMs for elemental speciation and that further development will require the use of molecular mass spectrometry. The relatively low concentrations of the elemental species means that pre-treatment methods with higher extraction efficiencies and selectivity are still urgently needed. They speculate that multiple extractions could improve method detection capability and decrease matrix interferences. Finally in this section on applications to biological systems, the application of ICP-MS in quantitative proteomics has been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> The reviewers cite 127 references (titles given) covering approaches in which quantification is based on (a) the measurement of elements already present in the target species, such as P and S, which allows the elucidation of the degree of protein phosphorylation in addition to absolute protein quantification, and (b) on bi-functional labelling substances, containing elements detectable by ICP-MS, that undergo covalent chemical reactions of previously established stoichiometry with the protein. The reviewers point out that this latter technique is very useful for the design of precise multiplexed quantification in biomarker screening and discovery schemes. They conclude that the increased interest in ICP-MS is reflected in the large number of proteomics publications describing complementary applications of plasma-source MS and MS with soft ionization techniques, such as MALDI and ES.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A number of reviews are focused on specific aspects of the instrumental techniques with an emphasis on NP characterization. In a well-constructed review, Marcinkowska and Baralkiewicz consider elemental speciation analysis by HPLC-ICP-MS, but confine their attention to those procedures in which speciation of more than one element is obtained.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> Most of the 92 articles cited (titles are provided) have appeared since 2000. The reviewers consider that the availability of commercial instruments with collision/reaction cell technology (CCT), which they consider to be an effective tool for the elimination of spectral interferences, is responsible for the growing use of the technique. They point out that the number of papers concerning multi-elemental speciation analysis is still increasing, indicative of the continued and growing interest in this field of analytical chemistry. The review opens with a number of useful sections dealing with the need for speciation analysis, of the interaction between elements and the current status of government regulations around the world. Most of the papers cited deal with two elements, about 20% of them concern three elements with only a few dealing with the speciation of four or more elements. The determination of As and Se species (mainly As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, MMA<small><sup>V</sup></small>, DMA<small><sup>V</sup></small>, Se<small><sup>IV</sup></small>, Se<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, SeMet, SeCys and SeCys<small><sub>2</sub></small>) predominate. The reviewers note that Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> is determined three times more often than is Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>, whereas Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Sb<small><sup>V</sup></small> are determined with about the same frequency. Several procedures for Hg and Pb species were also noted, but only a few procedures include Br, Cl, Cd, Mo, Te, Tl, V, or W. The most frequently analysed liquid matrices were water, urine or serum, and for solids, the most often reported were food products, ash and soil. The review includes a section on sample preparation. Although chromatographic conditions are surveyed, there is little critical commentary of this aspect of the methodology, nor is there any discussion of compound-dependent responses. However, there is a good section on the ‘metrological approach’, in which the reviewers point out that many papers do not contain a discussion of the uncertainty budget. The reviewers conclude that the continued development in this area of chemical analysis will lead to advances in the understanding of how biologically active elements interact with and react within living organisms. In a review of recent (June 2104 to June 2016) advances in CE-MS coupling, covering instrumentation, methodology, and applications, elemental speciation by CE-ICP-MS is featured in some 18 of the 161 articles (no titles) cited.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> Although the focus is on instrumentation and methodology, examples are given of applications in the fields of proteomics, glycomics, metabolomics, biomarker research, forensics, pharmacology, food analysis, and single-cell analysis. Separations by capillary electrochromatography, and micellar electrokinetic chromatography are not covered. Several of the ICP-MS examples were concerned with the determination of metallic NPs; it was pointed out, for example, that speciation analysis of metal-containing nanoscale materials in blood serum is needed to distinguish between the intact NPs and various protein conjugates. The application of CE to this topic is the subject of a review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> covering developments in the past 5 years. In considering possibilities for detection, the reviewers conclude that because of the specificity and detection capability of ICP-MS, it has become the ‘conventional approach in nano-bio studies’, though in fact only some 15 of the 53 articles (no titles) cited describe procedures based on CE-ICP-MS. The reviewers conclude, nonetheless, that as engineered nanoparticles containing metals are designed for intravenous administration, but before arriving at the target organ or cell are transformed in the blood by interaction with proteins, a crucial step in understanding their mode of action is evaluation of the reactivity and affinity of nanoparticles with these proteins. They also point out that the systematic application of ICP-MS detection has resulted in a paradigm shift from probing simple <span class="italic">in vitro</span> species systems to mapping multiplex interactions in real serum samples. One of the advantages of ICP-MS is that target analyte concentrations remain above the LOD when dilution is the approach to overcoming interferences from the saline, protein-rich matrices. The interaction between engineered nanomaterials and plants has been reviewed<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> with particular reference to the application of micro- and nano-XRF mapping and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The reviewers argue that the impact of engineered nanomaterials on plants, which are central components of ecosystems and the worldwide food supply, is of primary relevance. Hence, understanding the fate and physical and chemical modifications of NPs in plants and the possible transfer into food chains is crucial. They argue that the specialised analytical techniques available at synchrotron radiation facilities are well suited for this purpose as X-ray fluorescence mapping provides multi-elemental detection with lateral resolution at the double-digit nm scale, and spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy provides speciation information. The review features the contents of 102 articles whose titles are provided. Following well-written tutorial introductory sections, considerable space is devoted to sample preparation and to data acquisition and processing. The reviewers conclude that sample preparation will continue to be critical and that appropriate sample preparation protocols need to be further developed, especially for nano-X-ray fluorescence microscopy in order to preserve ultrastructure and chemical speciation. They point out that although the sample preparation strategy depends on the facilities available at the beamline, several sites now have the cryogenic setups that are highly beneficial for speciation studies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Several reviews cover aspects of non-chromatographic separation. In a comprehensive review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> of porous monoliths for on-line sample preparation, 172 references (with titles) are cited, but only about 22 of these are reports of elemental analysis of which a subset are concerned with speciation analysis. The main areas of application are for the analyses of environmental and biological samples. The bulk of the review is concerned with developments for organic analytes, which are discussed in considerable detail. A review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> of another aspect of SPE, the use of advanced functional materials in the determination of trace elements and their species by ICP-MS, covered the material in 190 references (whose titles are provided). The reviewers consider advanced functional materials to include nanometre-sized materials, porous materials, ion-imprinted polymers, restricted access materials, and magnetic materials, with properties such as high adsorption capacity, good selectivity, and fast adsorption/desorption kinetics. Monolithic materials are dealt with in some detail and there are 17 citations to the use of magnetic materials, which can be readily collected after dispersion in a bulk liquid. This approach may overcome the limitations of high back-pressures when nanometre sized adsorbents are packed into small columns. On the other hand, monolithic columns, featuring low back-pressure and high extraction capacity for trace elements and their species, which are easy to connect to ICP-MS detection, have shown potential for the determination of trace elements and their species in samples with limited sample amount, such as cells. Some cells have the ability to selectively bind elemental species of interest and the progress in this area of SPE speciation analysis over the period 2005–2015 has been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> The review contains a well-written introduction to the interaction of relevant species with both living and dead cells that covers not only the nature of the selective binding but also aspects of the toxicity of the various species. The reviewers point out the advantages of low cost, the wide range of sources, abundant binding sites and environmentally friendly features. They also claim that as cells have the capability to distinguish metal species based on the toxicity difference that this ‘endows them with incomparable superiority over synthetic adsorbents as solid phase extraction (SPE) media for heavy metal speciation’. Only 65 articles (no titles) are cited of which about half describe analytical procedures, many of which are featured in a summary table from which it can be seen that, with the exception of Hg, all the methods are concerned with the separation of inorganic species of differing oxidation state. The element for which most articles have been published is Cr (11 papers), followed by As with 9, Hg with 7, Se with 5, Sb with 3 and Sn and Tl one each. The reviewers conclude that the selectivity of cell-based heavy metal speciation is limited due to the complex nature of the surface binding groups of biological cells, and that the diversity of surface binding groups on biological cells acts as a double-edged sword: large capacity but poor selectivity towards some metal species. They propose that either chemical or genetic modification is needed to adjust the metal uptake behaviour to achieve the desired selectivity for metal speciation and speculate that this might be achieved through the expression of selected metal-binding proteins. Turker<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> has reviewed the speciation analysis of trace metals and metalloids by SPE with spectrometric detection as evidenced in 83 articles (no titles) covering the period 2012 through early 2016. Chromatographic separations and fractionations are excluded. The spectrometric detection techniques employed are almost all atomic spectrometric techniques. The review is divided into six sections, each devoted to a different element or elements, with speciation methods for As, Cr, Fe, Mn, Hg, Se and Tl discussed. Each section contains a summary table and is constructed on the one-paragraph-per-paper format. Each paragraph includes some information about reported LOD values and the validation of the method, so readers can draw their own conclusions about the suitability of a procedure for a particular analytical problem. Most of the sample matrices are environmental with an emphasis on waters.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Finally, some reviews are concerned with a particular analyte or matrix. A review of 49 articles (whose titles are provided) asks whether metal speciation analysis of petroleum is a myth or reality.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> The review begins with a tutorial introduction that sets the scene, pointing out that although metals are minor constituents in crude oil, but occur in a great variety of complexed forms, they are important as they affect the refining and production operations depending on their chemical state. In particular, metals have significant detrimental impact on the conversion into transportation fuels (vanadium and nickel) and on metal constructions (mercury species), and serve as tracers in geochemical prospecting and oil maturity indicators. The article includes a table entitled ‘advanced ICP-MS-based procedures attempted to petroleum speciation analysis’ that summarises the contents of some 11 papers covering Co, Hg, Ni and V. They point out that further speciation information on the metal coordination in a variety of porphyrin compounds is available from FT ion cyclotron resonance MS and that Hg species may be quantified by GC-ICP-MS. The reviewers conclude that despite the confident progress of mainstream speciation analysis, most attempts at simultaneous determination of different metal species in petroleum samples have not been successful. They consider that the problems lie with sample preparation and separation procedures, which are unable to resolve individual species prior the detection.</p>
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect372"><span class="a_heading">2 CRMs and metrology</span></h2>
      <span>The <span class="italic">development of a fruit juice CRM, certified for total As, iAs, DMA,</span> Cd and Pb has been reported this year.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> Total As and the As species were quantified by the standard additions approach whilst IDMS was used for determining the Cd and Pb content with the methodologies being performed according to ISO Guides 34 and 35. For the total elemental determinations the fruit juice was digested overnight at room temperature with concentrated HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> before dilution. Surprisingly, the Cd and Pb spikes for IDMS were added after this digestion step so any analyte losses during digestion would not be accounted for by IDMS. For As speciation, approximately 1 g of fruit juice was diluted 10 fold with high purity water (HPW) before injection into a mobile phase comprising 10 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> sodium 1-butanesulfonate, 4 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> malonic acid, 4 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> TMAH, 0.05% methanol in HPW at pH 3.0 flowing at 0.5 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> through a 150 mm C<small><sub>18</sub></small> column.

The method LODs and LOQs obtained among the eight laboratories were approximately 0.3 and 2 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively, for each of the analytes which were adequate for the intended purpose of the method. Each laboratory analysed method blanks, fortified method blanks, reference materials, triplicate portions of each juice sample, and duplicate fortified juice samples (one for each matrix type) at three fortification levels.

The average recovery of fortified analytes for all laboratories ranged from 98–104% iAs, DMA, and MMA for all four juice sample matrixes. The average iAs results for CRMs 1640a and 1643e were within the range 96–98% of the certified values for total As.

        <h3 id="sect525"><span class="b_heading">3.2 Arsenic</span></h3>
        <span>The <span class="italic">global interest in As speciation has continued this year</span> with numerous publications reporting on a diverse range of applications. A number of reviews have been published, including two focusing on human exposure to dietary iAs and other As species. Researchers associated with the Collaborative on Food with Arsenic and associated Risk and Regulation (C-FARR), based at Dartmouth College (USA) have comprehensively reviewed (244 references with titles) human exposure to organic arsenic species from seafood.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> The reviewers consider that in addition to inorganic As compounds, a full assessment of As in food, must account for organic As compounds in seafood, as this area is a crucial missing link in the understanding of exposure and informing regulatory practices. Much of the review is devoted to elaborating the present state of knowledge of these compounds and their toxicity and metabolism. There is a critical section devoted to chemical analysis, as the reviewers consider that shortcomings in evaluating exposure to organic As in seafood are largely due to analytical complications in reliably determining the complex distribution of As species in some of these samples. They conclude that the two most pressing needs for As speciation analysis of seafood are commercially available standards of As species and CRMs. It is of interest to note, therefore, that the synthesis and characterization of a number of methylated and thiolated arsenic species for environmental and health research has been extensively reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> In the review, which cites 154 sources (titles provided), more than a dozen methylated and thiolated As compounds that are not commercially available are discussed, including the following; AB, an arsenicin-A model compound, DMA<small><sup>III</sup></small>, DMA<small><sup>V</sup></small>, dicysteinylmethyldithioarsenite, dimethylarsino-glutathione, dimethylmonothioarsinic acid, dimethyldithioarsinic acid, MMA<small><sup>III</sup></small>, MMA<small><sup>V</sup></small>, monomethylmonothioarsonic acid, monomethyldithioarsonic acid, monomethyltrithioarsonate and TMAO<small><sup>V</sup></small>. The reviewers compared the available methods, synthesised the arsenic compounds in their laboratories, provide characterisation information, and recommend a synthesis procedure for each of the compounds. Methods for the determination of inorganic As in food, that have appeared in the period 2010 to 2015, have been examined in very considerable detail.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> The review, based on 280 articles (titles given), summarises the state of the art of analytical methods and highlights the tools for the examination of quality assessment of the results, such as the production and evaluation of CRMs, and the availability of proficiency testing programmes. The reviewers point out that the need for robust and reliable analytical methods is recognised by various international safety and health agencies and by organisations in charge of establishing acceptable concentrations of inorganic As in food. They conclude that mild extraction of inorganic As species, with separation and detection by HPLC-ICP-MS detection, is the most popular approach. However, they do acknowledge that some non-chromatographic approaches are faster and more cost-effective. It is also noted that although numerous methods use CRMs to validate As measurements, few CRMs are certified for the iAs content or other As species. In particular, the differences reported between the concentration of iAs in seafood CRMs illustrate the difficulty in obtaining a consistent value and reinforce the need for further development of reliable methods. They conclude that (a) the production of seafood CRMs, and (b) more proficiency tests for the determination iAs in seafood are needed. A review of human exposure to dietary iAs and other As species also considers the role of analytical methodology.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> The authors note that, despite classification as a human carcinogen based on data from populations exposed through contaminated drinking water, only recently has a need for regulatory limits for iAs in food been recognised. The reviewers consider the delay was due to the difficulty in assessing the risk associated with dietary iAs, which critically relies on speciation analysis. They also recognise the extensive use of HPLC-ICP-MS, though they do also mention AFS as a possible element-specific detection mode. They also state that because only quantification of iAs is needed from a food safety standpoint (which may not in fact be correct given current research) HG coupled with AAS, AFS or even ICP-MS offers a simple and cost-effective approach provided HG of methylated species is suppressed. Once again, the lack of suitable CRMs is highlighted, and, like the previous review,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> a list of available CRMs that are certified for the As species is provided. The reviewers point out that if the mass balance, between the sum of As species measured and the total As concentration, is not in agreement then the speciation analysis should be viewed as questionable.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Although Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span> must have been writing their review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a> of aromatic arsenical additives in soil at around the time (2015) that the US FDA was withdrawing approval (which they acknowledge) for the major players: roxarsone, arsanilic acid, carbarsone and nitarsone as animal feed additives, it is difficult to account for their description of these compounds as “safe and excellent feed additives. Widely used in swine, chicken, turkey, and other animal products in the United States”. The 150 articles cited (with titles) are mostly about the transformations of these compounds in the environment and fate of the resultant species, including the availability to plants. Limited space is devoted to aspects of chemical analysis: there is a brief section on extraction procedures, with more space given to the subsequent determination together with some discussion of ICP-MS isobaric overlap interferences. The limited number of SR X-ray studies are highlighted.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The vast majority of the <span class="italic">publications on As speciation in this review period</span> are applications of established approaches, often with modifications to suit a particular matrix. One of the few instrumental developments reported is a study of HG sample introduction combined with ICP-OES for non-chromatographic As speciation from solutions of As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, DMA and MMA.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> Hydrides were generated by reaction with NaBH<small><sub>4</sub></small> in acidic medium using a continuous flow system directly coupled to the ICP. The different reactivities of the As species under various reaction conditions in terms of the type and concentration of acids (HCl, acetic and citric), buffers (acetate and citrate), the NaBH<small><sub>4</sub></small> concentration and presence of pre-reducing agents (KI–ascorbic acid, thiourea–ascorbic acid and <span class="small_caps">L</span>-cysteine) were optimised for selective generation of their individual hydrides. The relationship between As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, DMA and MMA signals under different reduction conditions was also studied. In total, five speciation procedures for species-selective HG of As in one solution were evaluated. These were for As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, for As<small><sup>III</sup></small> + DMA, for As<small><sup>III</sup></small> + As<small><sup>V</sup></small> + MMA, for DMA + MMA and for As<small><sup>III</sup></small> + As<small><sup>V</sup></small> + DMA + MMA.

In contrast, thioarsenic standards were stable for the duration of analysis in spite of exposure to air. For samples containing thio-methylated As species, the extent of oxidation varied for different methylated As species. The study recommended flash freezing of samples in liquid nitrogen immediately after recovery and further storage under anaerobic conditions at −80 °C. A second experiment evaluating different HPLC columns for the separation of As thioanion species resulted in the preference for an IonPac column with NaOH as the mobile phase over the commonly used PEEK PRP-X100 anion exchange and Atlantis C<small><sub>18</sub></small> reverse phase column with ammonium phosphate mobile phases. However, distinct separation of thio-methylated As species with the IonPac column was not successful, potentially due to the matrix components. Acceptable detection, separation and quantification of thio-methylated As species were only achieved with the Atlantis C<small><sub>18</sub></small> column. The study demonstrated that preservation and analysis of these samples were matrix dependent, which has important implications for efforts to interpret As speciation in geothermal waters, especially those of low pH (2–3), low oxygen (≤49% saturation), low iron (≤5 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and high sulfur concentrations (≥91 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Although the behaviour of As under reducing conditions in periods of high water levels in wetlands is well understood and documented, there is less information on what happens under oxidising conditions when the water level decreases. In a recent study, Guenet <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> looked at the first stage of the oxidising period, when oxidation products are still in suspension. A soil sample from the Naizin Kervidy wetland (France) was incubated in the laboratory to produce a reduced soil solution. The reduced solution was subsequently oxidised, filtered and ultrafiltered using decreasing pore size membranes (5 μm, 3 μm, 0.2 μm, 30 kDa and 5 kDa). The distribution of As and Fe was investigated in each size fraction of the oxidized solution and their speciation studied using XAS, HPLC and SEC-ICP-MS. Organic matter was characterized using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation GC-MS. The majority of the As was present as As<small><sup>V</sup></small> but a small amount of As<small><sup>III</sup></small> still remained despite the advanced oxidised conditions. In the &gt;0.2 μm fractions, the XAS analyses showed that As was associated, in the second shell, with Fe (As–Fe – 3.35 angstrom) as bidentate binuclear complexes and C (As–C = 2.90 angstrom), suggesting the integration of As in biological objects. In the &lt;30 kDa fraction, As was directly bound to C (As–C = 1.96 angstrom) in the first shell indicating the presence of organic As species. In the second shell, an As–Fe distance of 3.35 angstrom was found showing that part of the As was still complexed with Fe. The 0.2 μm to 30 kDa fraction was a transitional fraction in terms of the Fe species and organic matter composition. In this fraction, organic matter exhibited a more humic character (aromatic molecules) inducing an increasing cation binding capacity. As a consequence, in this fraction and in the smallest one, As, Fe and OM seemed to form ternary complexes in which the Fe or nano-oxides in the &gt;30 kDa fraction and as monomer, or cluster in &lt;30 kDa fraction acted as a bridge. In all of the fractions, a proportion of As<small><sup>V</sup></small> was present as organic methylated species. Mass calculations provided evidence that 90% of the As was contained in the &gt;5 μm particulate fraction and thus was hardly mobile. The study showed that although wetlands have been identified as a potential source of As, a number of biological and geochemical trapping mechanisms also favour As stabilisation.</p>

The study demonstrated that engineered rhizobia expressing an algal arsM gene can methylate and volatilise As, providing a proof of concept for potential future use of legume-rhizobia symbionts for As bioremediation.</p>

Germination rates for the majority of cultivars exceeded 80% when exposed to As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, but fell to 20–40% when exposed to DMA. For a number of cultivars, grain yields were 20–50% lower when plants were exposed to DMA compared to As<small><sup>V</sup></small>. Grain As concentrations were between 0.6 and 1.6 μg As per g grain across the twenty cultivars when exposed to As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, whereas grain As concentrations were much higher (2.2–4.6 μg As per g grain) when exposed to DMA. When plants were exposed to As<small><sup>V</sup></small>, 100% of the As present in the grain was found as iAs, while in plants exposed to DMA, 70–90% of As was present as DMA with the remainder found as iAs. The decreased germination rates and grain yields in the presence of DMA is similar to the symptoms described for straight head disease in rice, which has been linked to DMA exposure. The authors hypothesise that exposure to DMA may have inhibited Si-metabolism and translocation which resulted in both developmental impairment and possibly an increased susceptibility to soil pathogens.

Thio-As species were found sporadically, but not in high concentrations in any of the macroalgae investigated. The authors report that the AB present in macroalgae is likely to be associated with epiphytic organisms while thio-arsenoribosides are likely to be produced by decaying parts of damaged macroalgae. A laboratory feeding experiment in which the herbivorous gastropod, <span class="italic">Austrocochlea constricta</span>, was fed macroalgae containing thio-arsenoribosides for a 24 h period every three days showed that these are readily accumulated over a short period. The thio-arsenoribosides in herbivores are therefore probably obtained through trophic transfer. Some AB was also obtained through trophic transfer; however, the presence of trimethylated arsonioribosides, a hypothesised precursor of AB formation in herbivores, suggested that some AB is produced within herbivores from the transformation of arsenoribosides accumulated from their diet.</p>

The polymorphisms of AS3MT, GSTO, and PNP were performed using a Sequenom MassARRAY genotyping platform. Polymorphisms of AS3MT genes were found to affect susceptibility to developmental delay in children, but GSTO and PNP polymorphisms were not. The data provide evidence that AS3MT genes are related to developmental delay and may partially influence As methylation capacity.

Genomic DNA was used to examine the genotype of XRCC1 (Arg399Gln), XRCC1 (Arg194Trp), XRCC3 (Thr241Met) and XPD (Lys751Gln) by PCR-RFLP. LC-MS was used to determine urinary 8-OHdG levels and HPLC-HG-AAS was used to determine the concentrations of urinary As species. Participants with the genotype XRCC1 (Arg194Trp) Arg/Trp + Trp/Trp had a significantly higher OR of RCC than those with the Arg/Arg genotype; the OR and 95% confidence interval was 0.66 (0.45–0.97) after multivariate adjustment. The OR of RCC for the combined effect of high urinary 8-OHdG levels and high urinary total As in individuals with a XRCC1 (Arg194Trp) Arg/Trp + Trp/Trp genotype was higher than in patients with an Arg/Arg genotype, which was evident in a dose response manner.

The column was eluted with 50 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Tris-HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> buffer (pH 7.4, 25 °C, flow rate: 0.5 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> or 1.0 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and the concentrations of As and S were continuously measured by ICP-MS. The authors found an organ preference for the distribution of DMA<small><sup>III</sup></small>(GS) to the lung and brain in comparison to NaAsO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Furthermore, DMA<small><sup>III</sup></small>(GS) appeared to bind to serum albumin by exchanging its glutathione moiety quickly after administration, providing insights into the longer retention of DMA<small><sup>III</sup></small>(GS) in plasma.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Studies on <span class="italic">As biotransformation mechanisms</span> have mainly focused on As<small><sup>III</sup></small> oxidation, As<small><sup>V</sup></small> reduction, and As methylation; however less is known about the pathway for the biosynthesis of arsenosugars. The involvement of As<small><sup>III</sup></small><span class="italic">S</span>-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) in arsenosugar synthesis has now been demonstrated for the first time by Xue <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a><span class="italic">Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803 incubated with As<small><sup>III</sup></small> or MMA<small><sup>V</sup></small> produced DMA<small><sup>V</sup></small> and arsenosugars, as determined by HPLC-ICP-MS. Arsenosugars were also detected in the cells when they were exposed to DMA<small><sup>V</sup></small>. A mutant strain Synechocystis AarsM was constructed by disrupting arsM in <span class="italic">Synechocystis</span> sp. PCC 6803. Methylation of As species was not observed in the mutant strain after exposure to As<small><sup>III</sup></small> or MMA<small><sup>V</sup></small>; when Synechocystis AarsM was incubated with DMA<small><sup>V</sup></small>, arsenosugars were detected in the cells. These results suggest that ArsM is a required enzyme for the methylation of iAs, but not required for the synthesis of arsenosugars from DMA, and that DMA is the precursor of arsenosugar biosynthesis.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally, a few studies have considered <span class="italic">As speciation in mice</span>. Arsenic methyltransferase (As3mt) catalyses the conversion of iAs to its methylated metabolites, including toxic MMA<small><sup>III</sup></small> and DMA<small><sup>III</sup></small>. A study to compare the oxidation states of As species in tissues of male C57BL/6 As3mt-KO and wild-type mice exposed to As<small><sup>III</sup></small> in drinking water has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> Wild type mice were exposed to 50 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> As and As3mt-knockout mice (that cannot tolerate 50 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> As) were exposed to 0, 15, 20, 25 or 30 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> As. The As<small><sup>III</sup></small> accounted for 53% to 74% of total As in liver, pancreas, adipose, lung, heart, and kidney of As3mt-KO mice; As<small><sup>III</sup></small> and As<small><sup>V</sup></small> methylated arsenicals did not exceed 10% of total As. Tissues of wild type mice retained iAs and methylated arsenicals: As<small><sup>III</sup></small>, MMA<small><sup>III</sup></small> and DMA<small><sup>III</sup></small> represented 55–68% of the total As in the liver, pancreas, and brain. High levels of methylated species, particularly MMA<small><sup>III</sup></small>, were found in the intestine of wild type, but not As3mt-KO mice, suggesting that intestinal bacteria are not a major source of methylated As. Blood of wild type mice contained significantly higher levels of As than blood of As3mt-KO mice. This study is reported to be the first to determine oxidation states of As species in tissues of As3mt-KO mice. Eicosanoids are a series of bioactive lipid mediators that are metabolised from polyunsaturated fatty acids and generated majorly from the precursor arachidonic acid. A study by Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> has identified the profiles of target eicosanoids after acute exposure to As. The principle objective was to determine and validate 10 eicosanoids in mouse serum using on-line SPE integrated with LC-MS. The LOD and LOQ were 0.003 to 0.288 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and from 0.009 to 0.962 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively and the intra-day and inter-day repeatability was 82–120 and 87–124%, respectively. The levels of 7 of the 10 eicosanoids in mouse serum significantly increased after As exposure compared with the levels in the vehicle control group.</p>

After exposure, the cells were harvested, pelleted and processed for their evaluation by the different techniques and assays. Data from SEM, TEM, light microscopy and μXRF measurements evidenced a preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in the endolysomes.

        <span>Only one paper covers the detection of Cs species. An analytical approach based on <span class="italic">in situ</span> XAFS analysis was used by Shiota <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a> as a rapid method for investigating chemical kinetics of Cs species during reaction in an alkali-activated municipal solid waste incineration fly ash. The Cs–K edge XAFS spectra, collected under different curing temperatures (room temperature, 60 °C, 80 °C, 105 °C), were processed using chemometric tools such as PCA and Linear Combination Fitting (LCF). It was found that Cs speciation changes over time during curing, and that when curing temperature was higher, those changes were faster and of a greater magnitude. The LCF results revealed that changes in <span class="italic">in situ</span> XAFS spectra reflect changes in pollucite (CsAlSi<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>6</sub></small>) content, the formation of which contributes to Cs stabilisation, thus preventing Cs leaching. A simple reaction model for the reaction was used to calculate the reaction rate and its constant, which was in agreement with the LCF results.</span>

        <span>The redox speciation of Cr in food samples, covering the work published since 2012 in 68 articles (titles not given) has been reviewed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> That Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> is essential and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> is a carcinogen is re-iterated and, therefore, speciation analysis of Cr in food is important. Following a short tutorial introduction, the review is divided into two main parts. The first deals with the analytical methodology: non-chromatographic speciation, based on selective LLE, co-precipitation, selective SPE or complexation reactions, and HPLC separations. The detection is almost exclusively by atomic spectrometry (including X-ray techniques). The second part is devoted to food type and covers water, beer and wine, tea leaves and infusions, milk and dairy products and flour and bread. Some criticisms are made: in the section on tea leaves and infusions readers are told (about three published articles) that the reports concerning the content of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in some foodstuffs with ETAAS detection without its identification are artefacts of inappropriately applied analytical methodology, which may lead to mistaken interpretations. The reviewer concludes that HPLC with ICP-MS detection seems to be the best technique, the application of the collision/reaction cell could reduce polyatomic interferences and that the use of enriched stable isotopes of <small><sup>53</sup></small>Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and <small><sup>50</sup></small>Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> allows the interconversion of species during the whole analytical procedure can be monitored (provided V does not co-elute).</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Compared to the activity covered in the previous ASU, there has been a significant decrease in the numbers of papers published describing methods for the elemental speciation of Cr. This is particularly true for methods featuring separation by HPLC, for which there is only one for the current review period as opposed to 11 such reports last year. Most of the 18 or so articles include in this update feature methods based on selective extraction (either LLE or SPE) for the Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> species. Papers that are primarily the application of methodology to a particular sample or only describe a procedure for the determination of one species are summarised in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. The only review article published, devoted to the determination of Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in foodstuffs,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> was discussed earlier in Section 1 on Topical reviews. Many of the new methods are based on separation followed by quantification with ETAAS.</p>

No citation was provided for the HPLC separation, which was not subject to any optimization, so it is not clear whether the method is new or not. The ICP-MS was operated in kinetic energy discrimination mode, with helium as the collision gas, to minimise the interferences of <small><sup>35</sup></small>Cl<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>35</sup></small>Cl<small><sup>17</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>12</sup></small>C<small><sup>+</sup></small> on the Cr peak at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 52. For the various dairy products analysed, three different sample preparation procedures were used (a) total Cr (hot concentrated nitric acid in a sealed vessel in a microwave oven), (b) Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> (alkaline extraction in an ultrasonic bath), and (c) Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> (0.05 M EDTA at pH 8.5 in a closed quartz flask in microwave oven). This latter procedure was developed after a substantial optimization. The method was validated by spike recovery of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, and the analyses of a fruit yoghurt and a CRM (ERM-CE278k mussel tissue), both of which had known Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> concentrations. Of the 17 real samples analysed, only 3 contained measurable concentrations of Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>, and 7 contained measurable concentrations of total Cr. The researchers identified Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> in everything that was injected into the system, which they ascribed to contamination from the HPLC injection system. They applied a correction, which they acknowledged affected the LOD of 13 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (dry weight) for a 0.3 g sample. As the Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> values found were not significantly different from those for total Cr, it was concluded that the foodstuffs concerned did not contain Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>.</p>

Reaction temperature was not investigated, though immediately after the TTA addition, the solution was heated for 8 min at 40 °C in an ultrasonic bath. At a pyrolysis temperature of 1200 °C, the Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>–TTA complex evaporated, leaving Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, which was then detected on atomization at 2400 °C. The procedure was validated by the analysis of two CRM (GBW(E)080403a and GBW(E)080404b), which are certified only for total Cr, and were also analysed by an HPLC-ICP-MS method (for which a citation is provided). They applied both procedures to the analysis of three water samples (tap, bottled and well), finding both species in all them, except for Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> in the tap water as the concentration was below the LOD of both methods. Both species were also found in the CRM. The LOD values were 0.05 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.04 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> and total Cr respectively. The characteristic mass was 8 pg.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A number of <span class="italic">SPE separation procedures</span> for Cr speciation have been developed, several of which feature magnetic separation. Wei <span class="italic">et al.</span> investigated<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">139</span></sup></a> iminodiacetic acid (IDA) functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>@SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>@IDA) finding that both Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> were retained in the pH range of 2.5–3.5, while only Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> was adsorbed in the pH range of 4.0–9.0. The species retained on 10 mg of sorbent, ultrasonically suspended in a 50 mL water sample, were dissolved, after collection with an Nd–Fe–B strong magnet, in 0.5 mL of 1.5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> nitric acid and determined by ETAAS. The researchers do not mention a second magnetic separation, but this seems likely as the desorption step involved ultrasonication for 30 min. Nor are any details of the calibration procedure given, so it is not clear which species was used for calibration or whether calibration standards were taken through the pre-concentration procedure. The method was validated by the analysis of CRM GSBZ50009-88 (environmental water), which is certified for total Cr (at 0.5 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). Their results indicated that the CRM contained between 30 and 50 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, but no comment was made. The LOD values were 9 and 13 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and total Cr, respectively and both species were quantifiable in two river water samples. Spike recovery at concentrations of 100 and 200 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were between 89 and 99%. A somewhat similar procedure was developed by Sarikhani and Manoochehri<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">140</span></sup></a> in which the species were extracted by an imidazolium-functionalised magnetite graphene oxide nanocomposite material, whose synthesis and characterization are described in some detail. At pH 2, only Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was extracted, whereas both species were retained at pH 6. From a 500 mL sample the appropriate Cr species were extracted with 17 mg of extractant by stirring for 9 min. After magnetic separation, the Cr was eluted into 1.4 mL of 2.2 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl by stirring for 16.5 min, and the extractant was again collected magnetically. The Cr in a 20 μL subsample was determined by ETAAS with palladium nitrate as the chemical modifier. The furnace operating parameters are listed, but there is no information about the calibration procedure. Two SRMs, spinach leaves (NIST SRM 1570a) and natural water (NIST SRM 1640), were accurately analysed for the total Cr content. The LOD values (for a 500 mL sample volume) were 1 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> and 2 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for total Cr. The speciation method was applied to the analysis of two real waste water samples, in which both species were found at concentrations ranging from 2–30 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and from which spike recoveries of 5 and 10 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were 92–104%. The procedure was also applied to the analysis of several real vegetable samples, but no attempt was made at speciation even though the researchers state in their abstract that “the method was utilised for rapid extraction and speciation analysis in food samples”. The sample preparation involved digestion with hot concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Concentrations of Cr ranging between 3 and 10 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were found, and spike recoveries of 5 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were 86–104%. The researchers conclude that “the new nanosorbent can be used for the speciation analysis of other metal ions”, but the basis for this statement is not explained. A method involving two SPE materials has been developed<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141</span></sup></a> based on UAE and magnetic extraction on a nanocomposite prepared from magnetite nanoparticles, manganese oxide and alumina oxide, some of which was functionalised with<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141</span></sup></a> trimethoxysilane (AAPTMS). The Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>@MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> material oxidised Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> to Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> and was used for the pre-concentration of total Cr, whereas the AAPTMS-modified material was selective for Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>. After elution with nitric acid, Cr was quantified by ICP-OES. Although a detailed optimisation of some of the relevant parameters was carried out, no information is provided about the sample volume, but the eluent (dilute nitric acid) volume is “about 5 mL”. A pre-concentration factor of 94 was reported, so the sample volume must have been about 500 mL. The procedure was validated by the analysis of a CRM (environmental express trace metals in drinking water), diluted to a concentration of 10 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the method was applied to the analysis of 6 river water samples in which both species were found between 1.5 and 4.5 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and for which the total Cr values were not significantly different from those obtained by analysis by ICP-MS. The synthesis and characterization are described in great detail, but much of the information about the optimization of the analytical method is relegated to the supplemental information. Calibration was based on taking Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> standards (0–500 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) through the procedure. The LOD for Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was 20 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Unlike the situation for the two other methods based on magnetic nanomaterials, the Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>@MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> materials were reusable for up to 10 times.

        <p class="otherpara">Luz <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed <span class="italic">a SPE procedure</span> for the sequential determination (in synthetic saliva) of total Cr and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> by ETAAS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> Under optimal conditions, any Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> was adsorbed on to silica nanoparticles functionalised with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and separated by centrifugation, leaving the Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in the supernatant. Compound-dependent responses related to the presence of the saliva matrix were observed, so calibration with a mixture of Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was used for total Cr determination and calibration using Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was used for the determination of this species. The researchers claimed that this was the first time that the different atomisation behaviours of the atomization of Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> had been observed for ETAAS. Adding a chemical modifier (magnesium nitrate) decreased the sensitivities of both species in the saliva matrix, but did not remove the sensitivity difference. The LOD was 0.1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A similar method, incorporating a SPE cartridge containing 500 mg of a strong anion-exchange material (quaternary ammonium groups), was developed for the determination of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> in airborne particulate matter.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> The Cr species were extracted with an alkali and the pH adjusted so that only Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was retained. After washing off the unretained Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>, the Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was eluted (volume not given) with a solution containing equimolar concentrations of ammonium sulfate and hydroxide. Total Cr was determined following digestion of the particulate material and filter. The LOD was 0.1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The method was validated by spike recoveries from filters and by comparison with the results of a spectrophotometric method. The procedure was applied to six work place environments, in three of which (welding foundry and electroplating) Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was detected following an 8 hour sampling period. The researchers speculate that the method may be an alternative to those based on the high-cost techniques of HPLC and ICP-MS for monitoring occupational exposure to Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>. In principle, a procedure based on retention on a SPE cartridge has the potential to incorporate a pre-concentration step. Tiwari <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">144</span></sup></a> devised such a method in which Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> was retained on 78 mg of Amberlite XAD-16 loaded with salicylic acid in a column (3 mm × 3 cm). An automated flow injection (FI) system was connected directly to a FAA spectrometer. The sample volume was 10 mL, loaded at 5 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and the eluent was 0.1 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> nitric acid at 4 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Based on the absorbance of the peak maximum the enhancement factor was 79 resulting in a LOD of 0.1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. There did not appear to be a wash step, so the fate of any Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> remaining in the column is not clear. Total Cr was determined following reduction of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> by hydroxylamine hydrochloride (45 min at room temperature). The Cr content of SRM NIST 1640a (trace elements in industrial water) was determined accurately and the method was applied to the analysis of three industrial water samples in all of which both Cr species were found at concentrations between 15 and 50 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Recoveries of 20 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> spikes were between 96 and 101%.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An electromembrane extraction method, one of a number of <span class="italic">methods based on LLE</span>, has been devised.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145</span></sup></a> In this procedure Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was selectively extracted as the cationic complex with diphenylcarbazone into 30 μL of a dilute acid acceptor solution in the interior of a hollow fiber membrane loaded with 2-ethylhexanol. Presumably, the species actually transported across the supported liquid membrane was an ion-pair. The complex was formed by the addition of diphenylcarbazide to an acidified sample solution, when Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was reduced to Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> and was complexed by the oxidation product, diphenylcarbazone. It would appear that any Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> also present in the sample did not react with the diphenylcarbazone. To accelerate the extraction, electrodes were placed in the sample solution (positive) and in the acceptor solution (negative) and a potential of 300 V applied. The method was optimised by a univariate search of the relevant parameters, which did not include the nature and dimensions of the hollow fibres, which were porous PPQ3/2 poly-propylene with 300 μm wall thickness, 1200 μm internal diameter, and 0.2 μm pores. The end of the 31 mm long fibre was sealed with hot pliers. The optimization clearly showed the electrokinetic effect, as the signal in the absence of the applied potential but with vigorous stirring was much lower than that obtained when the potential was applied. The optimization also showed that stirring was also needed as a higher signal was obtained when the solution was stirred. Following extraction, 20 μL were transferred to the atomiser of a continuum-source atomic absorption spectrometer. Total Cr was determined after oxidation with hot acidified permanganate, the excess of which was removed by dropwise addition of a sodium azide solution. The enrichment factor was 110, corresponding to 66% recovery, and the LOD was 0.02 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The method was applied to the analysis of three water samples (tap river and mineral), in which both species were found, apart from Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> in the tap water, at concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 0.44 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Spike recoveries of 0.25 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of both species were 76–108%. Porto <span class="italic">et al.</span> used a continuum-source flame atomic absorption spectrometer in a DLLME method<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit146"><sup><span class="sup_ref">146</span></sup></a> optimised by both univariate search and response surface methods. With APDC as the complexing agent, Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was extracted (at pH 2) into 50 μL of 1-undecanol with the aid of 300 μL ethanol. After collection by centrifugation, the organic solvent was removed with a micropipette, mixed with 200 μL of ethanol and introduced into the spectrometer by a discrete nebulisation device (a micropipette tip). To also extract Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small>, the sample (pH 7) was heated at 80 °C for 15 min and only 275 μL ethanol was needed. For both analyses, sodium chloride was added to the solutions at a concentration of 5% (m V<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). No information about calibration was given, other than the standards were prepared in ethanol. Enhancement factors of 19 (for the conditions for total Cr) and 26 (Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>) were obtained with LOD values of 7 and 0.4 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, for total Cr and Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, respectively. The procedure was applied to the analysis of a certified water reference material (NIST SRM 1643e), for which a value of 16 ± 2 (standard deviation <span class="italic">n</span> = 3) μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained. The certificate value is 20.4 ± 0.2 (expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2). The researchers claim that there is no significant difference between these numbers. The method was applied to the analysis of one tap and three mineral water samples, in none of which could the analytes be determined. Recoveries for spikes between 2 and 50 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> ranged from 88–115%. Given the rather large difference in LOD values, a better approach might be to oxidise any Cr<small><sup>III</sup></small> to Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> as was done by Tafti <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">147</span></sup></a> who devised procedure they called supramolecular DLLME-based solidification of floating organic drops (SM-DLLME-SFO) in which Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> was extracted (from 10 mL of sample at pH 2.5) as the APDC complex into decanoic acid (70 mg), which was rapidly injected as a solution in tetrahydrofuran (700 μL) into the aqueous sample, whereupon a cloudy suspension of water-immiscible, fine droplets of coacervates of decanoic acid formed immediately. The organic solvent was collected on the top of the aqueous phase by centrifuging, solidified by cooling and transferred to a conical vial where it melted immediately at room temperature. Finally, 15.0 μL of the extract along with 10.0 μL of a palladium magnesium modifier was manually injected into the graphite furnace atomiser. Total Cr was determined after oxidation with permanganate as described above.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145</span></sup></a> The enhancement factor was 127 and the LOD was 2 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The method was applied to the analysis of a CRM (NRCC river water SLRS-1) for which a total Cr concentration of 0.35 ± 0.25 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained. The ± term was not specified, but might be the standard deviation for <span class="italic">n</span> = 3. As the 95% confidence interval would be −0.26 to 0.97 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, it is perhaps not surprising that the researchers concluded that the result was not significantly different from the certificate value of 0.36 ± 0.03 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This rather large ± term was not in agreement with the RSD determined for replicate (<span class="italic">n</span> = 6) analysis of a 0.1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> standard of 4.2%. They also applied the procedure to the analysis of three water samples (well, tap and river) and two serum samples (prepared by adding trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins, centrifugation and dilution), in all of which both species were found at concentrations ranging from 15 to 515 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Recoveries of spikes (20–100 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) ranged from 95 to 104%.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A number of papers are summarised in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. Some additional information may be of interest.

As with most methods for the HPLC separation of polar drugs and their metabolites, gradient elution was required to provide sufficient resolution of the peaks and the authors showed that under different methanol and acetonitrile eluent compositions the plasma gave a variable response for the measurement of Cl. For peak quantitation this effect was overcome by using a mathematical function to correct the effect of the eluent composition on the sensitivity for Cl, which was measured as <small><sup>35</sup></small>ClH<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> at <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> 37.

The accuracy of each method was determined using samples from CCl<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CHCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> abiotic degradation experiments, calibrated against isotopically enriched reference standards. In a related approach,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159</span></sup></a> overcoming the limitation of IRMS which can only be used for a narrow range of compounds due to the fixed Faraday cup configuration, GC coupled to MC-ICP-MS was developed for the compound specific stable Cl isotopic analysis of volatile aliphatic compounds. Both the approaches investigated also overcome the high sample requirements and offline sample preparation that are associated with analysis using TIMS. The MC-ICP-MS method was evaluated by using five in-house characterised standards and eight chlorinated methanes, ethanes, and ethenes. The isobaric interference of the <small><sup>36</sup></small>ArH<small><sup>+</sup></small> polyatomic on <small><sup>37</sup></small>Cl<small><sup>+</sup></small> was minimised by using dry plasma conditions.

Long-term reproducibility and accuracy was better than 0.3‰ if organics were analysed in compound mixtures. Standardization was carried out by using a two-point calibration and drift was corrected using an internal standard.

        <span>Following the pattern of recent years the number of papers concerning Hg speciation continues to rise. This is probably in part due to the increase in availability of ‘dedicated Hg analysers’ and also the use of selective extraction procedures, which is a less costly approach than the more traditional approach of the online coupling of a separation technique with an element selective detector. A second factor is of course the greater awareness of regulatory bodies on the need for the speciation of an element to be understood as opposed to just the total elemental concentration. The final factor is the technological advances that have allowed the measurement of Hg isotope ratios with sufficient accuracy and precision to allow Hg biogeochemical processes to be elucidated with a greater degree of certainty.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">speciation of Hg is increasingly being determined in samples of human origin</span> to assess exposure levels of these important toxins. One of the drawbacks in methods used for Hg speciation is that different extraction procedures are used for different sample matrices, with possible cost and throughput implications. Workers in one of the main centres for speciation studies in Europe, in conjunction with those from NIST, have therefore developed a common methodology for the simultaneous determination of MeHg, EtHg, and iHg in human blood, hair and urine by ID-GC-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit164"><sup><span class="sup_ref">164</span></sup></a> The extraction procedure involves the addition of <small><sup>201</sup></small>Hg-enriched MeHg, <small><sup>198</sup></small>Hg-enriched EtHg, and <small><sup>199</sup></small>Hg-enriched Hg<small><sup>II</sup></small> to the sample, either 0.15 g of blood or 0.5 g of urine or 0.1 g of hair followed by 3 mL of 25% TMAH and a magnetic stir bar. Subsequently, a focused MAE, 35 W for 4.5 minutes, of the Hg species was performed. Finally, the extracted Hg species were derivatised with sodium(tetra-<span class="italic">n</span>-propyl)borate (NaBPr<small><sub>4</sub></small>), extracted into hexane and pre-concentrated by evaporation of the hexane under N<small><sub>2</sub></small> before injection onto a DB-5MS column. The GC was coupled to a Q-ICP-MS <span class="italic">via</span> an in-house fabricated heated transfer line. The method was validated using three CRMs, NIST SRM 955c (Caprine Blood) Level 3 and IAEA 085 and 086, both human hair with all found values being in agreement, within uncertainty limits, with the certified values. As there was no urine CRM available the method was validated by spiking experiments at three levels, 1, 2 and 5 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, with recoveries of 97% or greater for all Hg species at each spiking level except for EtHg at 1 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> where the recovery was 94%. Conversion of MeHg and EtHg into Hg(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) was observed for all sample matrices under all sample preparation conditions evaluated as part of the method optimisation. The authors report that he most important factor for controlling species interconversion is the amount of amount of NaBPr<small><sub>4</sub></small> added for derivatisation. Dealkylation of EtHg into Hg<small><sup>II</sup></small> was observed for all sample matrices, up to 95% in blood, 29% in hair and 11% in urine. Dealkylation of MeHg ranged from 1 to 15% in blood and hair analyses, but was not observed with urine samples. Hg methylation was not observed in any matrix. The use of spikes enriched with different Hg isotopes for each Hg species allowed the observed dealkylation effects to be corrected for. Another matrix to which Hg speciation is being increasingly being applied to is human breast milk. It would be interesting to apply the above methodology to this sample type. A paper describing the validation of a method for the determination of MeHg species in breast milk has been published, by workers in another of the main centres for speciation studies in Europe in conjunction with colleagues from elsewhere.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> In this procedure a <small><sup>201</sup></small>Hg enriched MeHg spike was added to lyophilised breast milk. For analysis by GC-ICP-MS the MeHg was extracted from the spiked sample with 6 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and heating at 85 °C for two hours followed by derivatisation with NaBEt<small><sub>4</sub></small> and extraction into isooctane. The Hg species were separated on a 95% methyl-5% phenyl-polysiloxane column. For analysis by HPLC-ICP-MS the MeHg was extracted from the spiked sample with 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and heating at 85 °C for two hours. After centrifugation the supernatant was then freeze-dried, the dried material dissolved in HPW. The Hg species were separated on a C<small><sub>8</sub></small> column with a mobile phase of 60 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> ammonium acetate, 0.01% 2-mercaptoethanol in 5% methanol. In each case Hg isotope ratios were measured using a Q-ICP-MS. The authors report that the GC method was less robust than the HPLC method, mainly due to the effects of the sample matrix on ethylation efficiency and the need for pH measurements on each sample. However, the HPLC column required a clean-up stage after approximately 50 samples due to increasing back pressure due to the retention of compounds such as proteins. No mention of a guard column is made and the use of one could have simplified the clean-up procedure required. For the GC method a ‘progressive seizure’ of the injection syringe was observed after analysis of 10–20 samples. The LOQ of the HPLC-ICP-MS method was evaluated using a ‘trueness bias’ approach, using an in-house RM of infant formula spiked with MeHg, was evaluated to be 0.16 μg Hg per kg wet weight. The method was applied to 180 samples of breast milk with most values being &lt;the LOQ and the highest found to be 0.43 μg Hg per kg wet weight.</p>

The desorption step was repeated, the fractions combined and the extract analysed for MeHg using CE-ICP-MS. Thus, the enrichment factor was 250 fold. The MeHg IIMNPs could be used for 50 water samples. The method was validated by spiking tap water with MeHg to give final concentrations of between 1 and 20 pg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with recoveries ranging from 92–98% and a reported LOD value of 0.084 pg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The use of a more conventional automated DLLME device, directly coupled to an HPLC-CV-AFS instrument, for extraction and analysis of Hg species in water samples has also been reported this year.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> The water samples were filtered (0.22 μm) and the pH adjusted to 5 before subjection to the DLLME procedure. Details of the HPLC-CV-AFS system are given in a cited reference. Under optimal conditions the linear range was 10–1200 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for EtHg and 5–450 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for MeHg and Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small>. The LOD values were 3.0 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for EtHg and 1.5 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for MeHg and Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small>. Method validation was by spiking with recoveries ranging between 88 and 96.1% and the RSD was &lt;5.1%. The apparatus was used to determine Hg species in six water samples, no MeHg or EtHg was detected and iHg ranged between 14 and 200 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A method has been developed using thiolated graphene (G-SH) for the CPE iHg and MeHg. The Hg species extracted were separated and quantified using HPLC-ICP-MS. The chromatographic conditions were a C<small><sub>18</sub></small> column, with a mobile phase of 1.0 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small><span class="small_caps">L</span>-cysteine, 60 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> ammonium acetate flowing at 1 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Under optimal conditions, the enrichment factors, for a 40 mL sample were 78 and 77 for iHg and MeHg, respectively. The LOD values were 3.8 and 1.3 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for iHg and MeHg, respectively with spike recoveries of &gt;94% for both species. The method was applied for speciation of mercury in surface water, ground water, domestic sewage and sea water with only iHg being detected the seawater and domestic sewage samples. Finally, in this section on Hg speciation in waters the development and use of flow injection (FI) photochemical vapour generation (PVG) coupled to a miniaturised solution cathode glow discharge-atomic emission spectroscopy (SCGD-AES) device has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> Mercury speciation was achieved by using different irradiation powers and wavelengths from a UV lamp and irradiation times. Total Hg is converted to Hg<small><sup>0</sup></small> at 8 W at 254 nm and 60 s of irradiation. Only Hg<small><sup>II</sup></small> was reduced to Hg<small><sup>0</sup></small> at 4 W and 365 nm and a 20 s irradiation time. The difference in concentration between the total and iHg values is assumed to be the organoHg fraction. The LOD value was found to be 0.2 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The device was validated using GBW09101b (human hair) and GBW10029 (fish tissue) CRMs (no sample preparation procedure is given) and spiking of tap water. All results for the CRMs were in agreement, within uncertainty limits, with the certified values and spike recoveries were 96% or greater.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Two papers report on <span class="italic">Hg speciation in rice</span> this year. In the first of these two different extraction procedures, MAE with either 6 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> or alkaline TMAH, were compared.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">170</span></sup></a> The extracted species were ethylated and the extracts analysed using GC-pyrolysis-AFS. The method were validated using BCR-60 (aquatic plant), BCR-482 (lichen) and NCS ZC73027 (rice plant) CRMs for total Hg. As these CRMs are not certified for MeHg they were also used for MeHg spike recovery validation. No statistical difference (F and Students <span class="italic">t</span>-test) was found for the results obtained using either of the extraction procedures. For the CRMs the measured total Hg content was in agreement, within uncertainty limits, with the certified values and MeHg spike recoveries were 98% or greater for all extractions except for the alkaline extraction with the rice plant CRM, NCS ZC73027, which was 81% suggesting that the acidic extraction procedure is more suitable for this type or sample. The TMAH extraction also suffered from higher blank values than the acidic extraction leading the authors to conclude that the acidic extraction was more suitable for this type of work. The second paper covered here reports the MeHg and total Hg content in rice grains harvested from plants grown in the vicinity of a coal fired power station.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> In this work the rice seeds were dehusked, ground and the 177 μm fraction collected. The MeHg in the ground rice was extracted using 25% KOH in methanol at 75–80 °C for 3 h, leached into CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> and back-extracted into HPW for a determination based on US EPA method 1630. A similar procedure, but replacing the methanolic KOH with HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, was sued to extract and quantify the MeHg content of the soils in which the rice plants were growing. The method was validated using TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas) CRM and spiking of rice samples with MeHg. For TORT-2 the found and certified values agreed within uncertainty limits and the spike recoveries ranged from 72–99%. For the soil samples MeHg spike recoveries varied between 92 and 107%. The MeHg content of the rice samples varied from 1.7 to 3.8 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and from 0.3 to 3.5 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the soil samples. There was no correlation between the MeHg content in the rice samples and distance from the power plant, which, the authors suggest, may be due to the presence of a petroleum refinery and cement plant in the near vicinity of the collection point of the rice samples having the greatest MeHg content. Positive correlations of rice MeHg content with soil Hg species, soil S, and soil HG<small><sup>0</sup></small> content were however observed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Four papers are concerned with <span class="italic">Hg speciation in sediments and soils</span> this year. The first of these articles reports the results of an interlaboratory comparison (<span class="italic">n</span> = 4) of the analysis of 17 sediment and soil samples collected from Hg contaminated areas.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> Two laboratories used GC-pyrolysis-AFS with the other two methods be GC-ECD and HPLC-CL.

The method LOD was 0.07 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The second method involved alkaline leaching, extraction into toluene with dithizone, back extraction into alkaline Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>S solution, S<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> removal with HCl, re-extraction of the formed dithizone–MeHg complexes into toluene, filtration and analysis by GC-ECD. The method LOQ was 0.1 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The third and fourth methods were leaching with 5 mL of 18% KBr in 5% H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> solution and 1 mL of 1 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> CuSO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, extraction into CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> and either ethylation of propylation, purging and trapping onto Tenax followed by thermal desorption and analysis by GC-pyrolysis-AFS. The method LOD was 0.05 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Each laboratory also analysed two estuarine sediment CRMs, ERM-CC580 and IAEA 405, and all results obtained, except for the HPLC-CL method for IAEA 405, were in agreement with the certified values. The results obtained for most of the samples by all methods were in agreement except for those samples which had a high S content and the procedure involved the use of a halide based reagent. The authors suggest that, for samples rich in S, the use of a stronger extractant than HBr or HCl, such as dithizone should be considered. A detailed discussion on the possible causes of poorer extraction from S rich samples is included in the article and suggestions for method improvement given. The paper highlights that information about sample chemical composition is needed before analysis is undertaken. The second paper covered here details the evaluation of Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation rates in vegetated and non-vegetated saltmarsh sediments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> To achieve this sediment cores were spiked, into various sediment horizons, with tracers of <small><sup>199</sup></small>Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> and CH<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>201</sup></small>HgCl. Total Hg measurements were made, after an Aqua Regia extraction of sediment samples, by ID-CV-ICP-MS. A water vapour distillation method, in the presence of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> (9 molar) and KCl, was used to extract MeHg from the sediment samples followed by ssID-ICP-MS. The paper contains a detailed discussion on the Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation rates observed and factors which may affect these rates. The results suggest that the formation of MeHg from iHg linked to the presence of vegetation but that this observation might be site specific and further studies are needed. The third paper reviewed here covers the quantification of MeHg and Hg geochemistry at a former Au ‘exploitation’ site in Brasil.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a> A water vapour distillation method was employed to extract MeHg from sediment samples as described above followed by ethylation, trapping, thermal desorption and analysis by GC-pyrolysis-AFS.

The LOD and LOQ values, for a 0.5 g sample, were 0.11 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.33 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. The site is heavily contaminated in places, with a total Hg content ranging from 0.06 to 43 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> whilst the MeHg content ranged between &lt;LOD to 8 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The final paper in this section comprises a ‘critical evaluation’ of a water vapour distillation procedure for the determination of methylmercury in soil samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> A Plackett–Burman design was used to evaluate the effect of the following parameters on the extraction efficiency of the procedure; distillation time, KCl%, acid concentration, gas flow, type of acid, (HCl or H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and water volume. The optimal conditions were found to be, 0.5 g of dried soil or sediment, 200 mL of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> (9 molar), 200 mL of KCl (20%) and 10 mL water and a distillation time of 70 minutes. After extraction MeHg ethylated, trapped, thermal desorbed with analysis by GC-AFS and ID-GC-ICP-MS. The results obtained by detection systems were broadly in agreement. Finally, the optimised method was applied to soil samples collected from sites impacted by coal fired power plants and the found MeHg content ranged from 0.09–3.9 ng Hg per g.</p>

          <span class="italic">During the past year, two reviews have appeared</span>. A comprehensive review on Se bioavailability in food by Moreda-Piñero <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit188"><sup><span class="sup_ref">188</span></sup></a> summarizes published data concerning to the application of <span class="italic">in vivo</span> and <span class="italic">in vitro</span> approaches as well as the effect of food processing and food composition (protein, fat and mineral content) on Se bioaccessibility. There are also extensive tables including Se bioavailable percentages in different types of food samples (cereals, vegetables, seafood, algae and seaweeds, yeast and yeast-based supplements, eggs and milk). The review cites more than 100 references. The second review reports the last achievements on Se speciation by using microextraction techniques.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">189</span></sup></a> The first section of the review describes the theoretical principles behind microextraction techniques focusing on solid phase microextraction (SPME) and liquid phase microextraction (LPME). The second part is dedicated to pre-concentration and speciation procedures by using microextraction techniques connected to several instruments such as AAS, GC-MS, ICP-MS, HPLC-ICP-MS and XFS. The last section deals on the future trends of Se microextraction techniques highlighting the use of nanostructured fibers for SPME. The review includes 52 references covering the period from 2008 to 2016.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Most <span class="italic">of the papers published this year on Se are based on the elucidation of its metabolism by performing both in vivo and in vitro studies</span> with the aim of gaining a deeper insight into Se metabolic pathway, Se role in health and diseases and Se protective effect against the toxicity of elements such as Hg and Pb. The performance of these studies usually implies the combined use of LC-ICP-MS and LC-ES-MS/MS. Related to the binomial Se and health, Bryan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit190"><sup><span class="sup_ref">190</span></sup></a> carried out a complete study on the role of Se in the progress of idiopathic cardiomyopathy disease by using whales as model, in particular pygmy sperm whales (<span class="italic">Kogia breviceps</span>). Selenoproteins were extracted from heart and liver tissues and separated and detected by a 2D-chromatography approach (2D-SEC-AE-ICP-MS). The SEC measurements were useful for observing differences in Se-containing peak patterns between stages of disease progression. Se containing fractions were further collected and subsequently analysed by RPLC-ES-MS/MS for peptide sequencing and protein identification. A database search allowed authors to identify selenoproteins such as GPX, Se-containing proteins such as SeAlb and Se-binding proteins such as metallothioneins either in liver or heart tissues. Analysis of the data by ANOVA showed significant variation in metallothionein levels between animals groups with and without pathological findings. A notable increase in the level of Se-containing metallothioneins was detected in those animals suffering cardiopathy. One of the most novel findings of this year under review is the protective effect of Se containing phycocianine (Se-PC) against paraquat-induced renal injury.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">191</span></sup></a> Phycocianine (PC) is a type of phycobiliprotein from cyanobacteria with beneficial effect on lungs and renal diseases. The combination of this valuable product with the antioxidant properties of Se may improve the beneficial effects of PC. Based on that, Se-PC was isolated from Se-enriched N-fixing cyanobacterium (<span class="italic">Nostoc</span> spc) and subsequently purified by using a step–step approach that includes, (1) stepwise precipitation of contaminant proteins and the Se-PC fraction by adding 30% and 50% NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, respectively, (2) separation of Se-PC fraction from concomitant proteins by DEAE-sepharose chromatography using increasing NaCl concentration as mobile phase and (3) collection of Se-PC fraction and final purification by Sephacryl S-300 SEC using 2 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Na<small><sub>3</sub></small>PO<small><sub>4</sub></small> buffer (pH 7.0) as a mobile phase at 1 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The effect of the purified PC and Se-PC extracts on KH<small><sub>2</sub></small> cell viability after a 24 hour exposure to paraquat was further evaluated. Data from caspase-3-activity and ROS generation assays revealed that Se-PC blocked PQ-induced cell apoptosis through restraining the overproduction of superoxide and preventing therefore oxidative damage and nephrotoxicity. The work opens new insights on the use of Se-PC for treating those renal diseases mediated by oxidative stress processes. In another paper, Se deficiency has been associated with the appearance of age-related cognitive illness.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192</span></sup></a> Based on that, Se status and Se bound to proteins in different biofluids (serum, red blood cells and cerebrospinal fluid) of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients was determined by ICP-MS and SEC-ICP-MS measurements. No differences in Se levels in serum were observed between AD and control patient groups. However, a significant decrease in Se level was reported in erythrocytes from AD patients. Separation of serum by SEC-ICP-MS evidenced the presence of a Se-containing fraction which was collected, purified and analysed by ES-MS/MS. The application of a bottom-up proteomics approach allowed authors to confirm the presence of the selenoprotein SelP in the Se-containing fraction.</p>

The concentration and speciation distribution of MeHg and Se was monitored by LC-ICP-MS and a chip-based treatment method. The cytosolic fractions of HepG2 cells were first fractionated in a SEC-ICP-MS and the low molecular weight containing Hg and Se molecules were subsequently analysed by RP-LC-ICP-MS. Based on MS/MS data, the complexes MeHg–GSH and MeHg–Cys were identified. On-line chip-based MSPME-micro HPLC-ICP-MS was applied to evaluate the accumulation kinetics of MeHg during incubation studies. Data evidenced an increase of MeHg and Hg<small><sup>(II)</sup></small> concentration with increasing incubation time and MeHg/SeCys<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratios. The authors suggest a Se detoxification mechanism based on aggregation of MeHg and SeCys<small><sub>2</sub></small> to promote the uptake of MeHg followed by transformation of MeHg into complex species (MeHg–GSH and MeHg–Cys).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Two papers report on s<span class="italic">elenoproteins (SelP, SeAlb and GPx) quantification in plasma and serum samples by using HPLC post-column ID-ICP-MS</span> and by employing two affinity columns: heparin sepharose (HEP) and Blue sepharose (BLUE). In the first study,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit196"><sup><span class="sup_ref">196</span></sup></a> the method was applied for determining selenoproteins in 849 individuals belonging to the Arctic indigenous population of Inuit of Nunavik (Canada) who have a Se uptake which is amongst the highest in the world. Total plasma Se concentrations (median = 139 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>; interquartile range (IQR) = 22.7 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) were markedly lower and less variable than whole blood Se concentration (median = 261 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, IQR = 166 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). With regard to Se distribution in Se-containing proteins, 52% was found in SelP, while GPx and SeAlb represented only 25% and 23% of total Se in plasma, respectively. Interestingly, comparisons were made between populations with high levels of Se intakes. A non-linear relationship between whole blood and plasma Se was found in the Inuit population which is not in agreement with data already published from communities consuming Brazil nuts where a linear relationship is reported. The different behaviour suggests accumulation of different Se compounds, SeMet in a Brazilian Amazon population and possibly selenonine in blood of an Inuit population. Additionally, Hg was monitored and quantified in plasma simultaneously while performing Se speciation. Mercury appeared associated to selenoproteins especially SelP that bounds 50% of total mercury. In the second paper, modifications in the HPLC post-column IDA-ICP-MS methodology were performed with the aim of improving the accuracy of selenoprotein quantification.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit197"><sup><span class="sup_ref">197</span></sup></a> One of the problems encountered by the authors are the changes observed in the signal provided by <small><sup>77</sup></small>Se and <small><sup>78</sup></small>Se spikes when are continuously added after the column. Variations in the Se background during separation hampered the proper quantification of selenoproteins, especially SelAb. The reason for the unstable Se signal was attributed to the mobile phase composed mainly of NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>Ac with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The introduction of high levels of NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>Ac into the ICP-MS increases the carbon load into the plasma affecting therefore the Se sensitivity by enhancing its signal. The alternative use of NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> as eluting solvent provided stable background levels and notably improved the quantification of selenoproteins in blood serum. Finally, <small><sup>77</sup></small>Selenite and <small><sup>76</sup></small>SeMet were employed as tracers to evaluate losses of low-molecular-weight Se metabolites during deproteinisation of blood and plasma samples. Two Se species, <small><sup>77</sup></small>Se<small><sup>IV</sup></small> and <small><sup>76</sup></small>SeMet, were chosen as model compounds for iSe and seleno amino acids, respectively.

For this purpose <small><sup>77</sup></small>Se<small><sup>IV</sup></small> and <small><sup>76</sup></small>SeMet were added to plasma and hemolysed blood samples. The spiked samples were then submitted to protein precipitation and the resulting supernatant and pellets were analysed by SEC-ICP-MS and reverse isotope dilution. Different behaviours were observed depending on the Se compound, the solvent used for protein removal and the sample type. The <small><sup>76</sup></small>SeMet remained in solution after precipitation in both plasma and blood samples whereas <small><sup>77</sup></small>Se<small><sup>IV</sup></small> completely disappeared in solutions of blood samples. The best results were obtained by using the methanol–acetonitrile–acetone mixture. The SEC-ICP-MS measurements evidenced that both co-precipitation phenomena and association with proteins are the main causes of selenite losses during protein precipitation in blood samples. The study highlights the importance of sample treatment in selenometabolomics and metabolomics in general.</p>

In this vein, samples were treated with different extracting solutions (water, 0.1 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> NaOH, 1 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HCl, and 4 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> MSA) either under sonication or heating (room temperature, 50 °C and 95 °C), and by applying different treatment times. Heated water extraction was selected for releasing Se compounds in the supplements tested. For the separation and detection of the species, a Zorbax StableBond (SB-Aq) (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 mm) column coupled to the ICP-MS was used. For those extracts containing MeSeCys or SeMet, additional Se-containing peaks were detected and attributed to the presence of seleno-amino acid oxidation products. To confirm the peak identities, the extracts with and without H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O treatment were analysed using LC with simultaneous ICP-MS and ES-MS detection. Se methylselenocysteine oxide (MeSeOCys) and methylseleninic acid (MSeA) were identified in MeSeCys-containing extracts. In the second paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit200"><sup><span class="sup_ref">200</span></sup></a> a rapid screening method based on the combination of XFR and real time resolution accurate-mass spectrometry (DART-HRAMS) was applied to directly determine iSe and selenoamino acids respectively. Samples were directly analysed without the need for dissolution of the sample. The use of DART-HRAMS in Se speciation has been limited due to its low performance when analysing Se incorporated to large molecules such as selenoproteins. Despite its limited use, the authors highlight its applicability for rapidly detecting adulteration or false label claims in selenised supplements by monitoring the presence or absence of SeMet or MeSeCys. By applying DART-HRAMS, analysis time (including sample preparation and analysis) was considerably reduced from 2 hours (LC-ICP-MS) to less than 10 minutes. The LOD was estimated to be 100 μg of Se which is suitable for detecting Se in dietary supplements with levels of total Se ranging from 600 to 1500 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Among Se supplements, selenised-yeast characterization has been a topic of much research in past years and nowadays the characterization of seleno-compounds continues to attract the attention of several researchers. About 100 seleno metabolites, most of them never reported, were identified in selenised yeast.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit201"><sup><span class="sup_ref">201</span></sup></a> Selenised metabolites were extracted in aqueous solution by means of probe sonication followed by SEC-ICP-MS analysis to collect a low-molecular weight fraction. The metabolites structural identity was subsequently assigned using LC-TOF-MS by means of accurate mass measurements and manual Se isotope pattern identification. Besides Se species, sulfur and S–Se species were also identified in the aqueous extract of selenised yeast. Following Se metabolism in selenised-yeast, the presence of selenohomolanthionine (SeHLan) was detected and identified for first time in water soluble extracts of Se-enriched torula yeast (<span class="italic">Candida utilis</span>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit202"><sup><span class="sup_ref">202</span></sup></a> The identity of SeHLan was confirmed by HILIC (TSKgel Amide-80 3 × 300 mm × 2.6 μm) -ICP-MS and HILIC-orbitrap-MS and by using a standard of SeHLan synthesised in the authors laboratory. Additionally, a methodology based on the use of HILIC-ICP-MS was developed for quantifying Se species and a LOD of 146 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was reported. The major Se compound in the trula yeast was SeHLan, accounting for a 60–80% of the total Se whereas the amount of SeMet was notably low (7–11% of the total Se). Selenium was mostly found in the water soluble extracts suggesting the non-proteinogenic origin of Se in this type of yeast. Finally, losses of Se during manufacturing of peanut flour containing Se-enriched proteins has been investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit203"><sup><span class="sup_ref">203</span></sup></a> First, the authors performed a comparative study of different extracting solutions for determining selenospecies in Se-enriched peanut by RPLC-ICP-MS using a Zorbax RX-C8 (4.6 mm × 150 mm/5 μm) column and 0.1% PFPA, 2% MeOH at pH 1.98 and flowing at 0.9 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> as mobile phase. Best results in terms of extraction yield were obtained when using a mixture of protease, lipase and sodium thiosulfate (2<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1; 5 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and after one hour of ultrasonic processing. Under these conditions, recovery rates ranged from 85 to 102% were obtained. The predominant specie found in the peanuts was SeMet, accounting for 65% of the total Se. Losses of Se, of about 37% of the total Se content, were detected during manufacturing peanut protein flour. The detected Se losses were attributed to Se volatilisation, dissolution, degradation or physical transfer that may occur during the complex process needed to manufacturing the peanut-based Se flour.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A method based on the use of Zorbax SB-C18 (4.6 × 250 mm) column on line coupled to HG-AFS was employed for performing <span class="italic">Se speciation in food</span> and beverages.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit204"><sup><span class="sup_ref">204</span></sup></a> The main novelty of the paper is the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as mobile phase modifiers for the separation of Se<small><sup>IV</sup></small>, Se<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, SeMet and MeSeCys. Most of the paper is devoted to performing a multivariate optimization of the parameters affecting Se species separation and hydride generation in presence of imidazolium type-ILs with different alkyl chain lengths. The Se species in the selected samples were efficiently separated in 12 minutes using 0.1% (v/v) of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C<small><sub>6</sub></small>mim]Cl) as a modifier. The LOD values of 0.92, 0.86, 1.41 and 1.19 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were obtained for Se<small><sup>IV</sup></small>, Se<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, SeMet and MeSeCys, respectively. These values were comparable or even better than those obtained when applying HPLC-ICP-MS. According to the authors, the hypothesised separation mechanisms in presence of ILs involves different processes such as: interaction between anionic Se species and IL molecules retained on the stationary phase as well as hydrophobic partitioning of the ion pairs formed between ILs and Se species with the RP stationary phase. The method was successfully applied to garlic, yeast, beer and wine samples. Recovery values of between 95 to 105% were obtained in the different food and beverage samples.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Most studies related to Se are focused on its essentiality however it is considered one of the elements with the narrowest ranges between deficiency and toxicity.

        <span>An analytical procedure based on RP-HPLC-ICP-QQQ-MS was developed for determining ergothioneine in biological matrices.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit212"><sup><span class="sup_ref">212</span></sup></a> Chromatographic separation was performed using a RP column (Gemini C6-Phenyl 4.6 × 150 mm) and a methanol gradient as mobile phase flowing at 0.5 mL mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. With the aim of decreasing separation time due to the presence of strongly retained sulfur species, a 6-port valve was introduced to direct the column effluent either to the ICP-QQQ-MS or to the waste. The developed separation reduced the analysis time from 120 to 30 minutes. After separation, ergothioneine and other S containing species were detected using an ICP-QQQ-MS, with an O<small><sub>2</sub></small> reaction gas flow rate of 0.3 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> so that a mass shift of 16 was used to monitor the S signal. The developed method provided LOD and LOQ values for ergothioneine of 0.23 and 0.80 μg S per L, respectively which are slightly lower than those provided by LC-MS/MS. The method was successfully applied to detect ergothioneine in ergothioneine-treated HPG 2 cell pellets. The presence of ergothioneine in this complex biological matrix was fully confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The applicability of the method for simultaneous monitoring of S (including ergothioneine) and Se species in food samples was also checked. Measurements by both RP-HPLC-ICP-QQQ-MS and LC-MS/MS measurements evidenced the presence of ergothioneine in water extracts of oyster mushrooms. Unfortunately, no Se signal was detected which was attributed to the use of water as extracting agent. In a second paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> a study has been conducted to detect sulfur-containing metabolites in roots and shoots of Alium sativum by employing HPLC-ICP-QQQ-MS and high resolution LC-MS/MS in parallel.

        <span>Tellurium has attracted increasing analytical attention due to its wide industrial application such as the development of new materials (quantum dots for solar panels) and the production of fluorescent probes. However, very little is known on the environmental and human health impact of this rare element. Consequently, Te speciation plays a key role for better understanding its distribution, toxicity and bioavailability. Three papers have been publishing covering the topic of Te speciation. The first one reviews the existing knowledge on Te metabolism in plants and microorganisms based on LC-ICP-MS and LC-ESI-MS/MS data.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> Similarly to Se, several Te metabolites such as MeTeCys, TeMet and TeCys has been detected and identified. Based on their own experimental data, the authors postulate a metabolic pathway of Te in plants. However, there are still many unknown metabolites that need to be identified. In a second paper Te speciation was performed in a contaminated soil from an abandoned mining area by using μ-XRF, μ-XRD and μ-XAFs techniques.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit215"><sup><span class="sup_ref">215</span></sup></a> Results showed that Te is present in the soil tested as a mixture of Te<small><sup>IV</sup></small> and Te<small><sup>VI</sup></small> and structurally incorporated into Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small>-hydroxides. According to the experimental <span class="italic">K</span><small><sub>D</sub></small> values obtained, Te<small><sup>IV</sup></small> is less retained in soils than Te<small><sup>V1</sup></small>, resulting in an easier release and migration of Te<small><sup>IV</sup></small> than Te<small><sup>VI</sup></small>. The results are of importance for understanding the solubility and mobility of Te in contaminated soils. Finally, other researchers developed a method based on HG-AFS for determining Te<small><sup>IV</sup></small> and Te<small><sup>IV</sup></small> in bioleaching solutions from low-grade Te ores treated with bacteria <span class="italic">Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a> Factors affecting HG were investigated in detail.

        <span>Thallium speciation in different matrices has been described in three papers. Two of them are based on the application of microextraction methodologies. In a first paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit217"><sup><span class="sup_ref">217</span></sup></a> a DLLME method followed by FAAS measurements has been developed for Tl<small><sup>I</sup></small> and Tl<small><sup>III</sup></small> speciation in hair samples. Most of the paper is devoted to the optimization of the parameters affecting microextraction efficiency, such as pH of the sample solution, concentration of the chelating agent (1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN)), type and volume of dispersant and solvent and ionic strength. Speciation of Tl<small><sup>III</sup></small> was carried out by extracting the Tl<small><sup>III</sup></small>–PAN complex with a mixture containing 2.5 mL of ethanol and 100 μL of 1-dodecanol. After centrifuging, the organic solvent droplet was solidified over ice, separated from the solution and melted at room temperature. Nitric acid in methanol was added prior to FAAS analysis. The method was applied to total Tl determination prior to oxidation of Tl<small><sup>I</sup></small> to Tl<small><sup>III</sup></small> by means of a Ce<small><sup>IV</sup></small> solution. The Tl<small><sup>I</sup></small> concentration was calculated by difference.

      <span>Over the current review period some important analytical hardware innovations relating to methods specifically applicable to the measurement and detection of small biomolecules, metalloproteins and metal–protein interactions have been described in the literature. This includes: the modification of specialist sample introduction systems to use with atomic spectrometry; the application of non-specific detection methods in combination with elemental MS; and the combination of different molecular MS sources to give orthogonal data.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">A review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit226"><sup><span class="sup_ref">226</span></sup></a> detailing the current state-of-the-art of analytical techniques for characterizing purified metalloproteins and metal–protein complexes has covered 129 references in the period from 2000 to 2014. Interestingly, it details some of the more overlooked mainstream direct spectrometric methods used in biochemistry and inorganic chemistry to characterise purified proteins. Techniques such as NMR and XRD, can be used for assessing the ternary protein structure, whereas other direct approaches including circular dichroism are useful for secondary protein structural elucidation. To identify and characterise the metal–protein environment, techniques such as XAS and XANES are options, if available, and for assessing metal-binding domains and metal–protein coordination EPR, FTIR and fluorescence spectrometry have been employed. Details of work involving 1D- and 2D-PAGE, CE and liquid chromatography <span class="italic">via</span> SEC, AEC or RPC are also covered, including the on-line and off-line coupling to MS detectors. This includes the use of ICP, ES, MALDI and LA-ICP-MS. The authors make the important point that the integrity of the metal–protein binding must not be compromised throughout the whole analytical process and that in some cases, metals bind to proteins with high-affinity (metalloproteins) and the bond is not broken during the separation process. However, metal–binding protein interactions can be of low affinity and the metal–protein bound can easily be lost during the separation process. Examples of applications in the food, environmental and clinical areas that have employed these techniques are discussed. The review also covers more recent work on nanoparticle–protein interactions and the formation of the protein corona. Unfortunately the review does not cover methods developed specifically for the characterisation of metal–binding proteins, such as immobilised metal affinity chromatography which can be used to purify native proteins or selectively isolate proteins with metal binding sites. The inclusion of papers using detection methods developed to specifically determine metal binding proteins, such as substrate-assisted laser desorption (SALD) MS, would also have been useful.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The use of non-specific detectors in biomolecular speciation studies have become less commonly used now that specific detectors such as ICP-MS are more widely available to use as HPLC detectors. However, with the advent of spICP-MS for the measurement of nanoparticles, the advantages of techniques such as multi-angle light scattering (MALS) as non-specific protein detectors are being realised. Light scattering represents a powerful technique for determining the molar mass of macromolecules in solution as well as monitoring the presence and formation of aggregates. When used as a detector for SEC separations, the light scattering and concentration are measured for each eluting fraction, the absolute molar mass and size can therefore be determined independently of the elution position. This is particularly important for species with non-globular shapes or that interact with a SEC column; such species typically do not elute in a manner that might be described by a set of column calibration standards. It is also possible to completely characterise the mass and size from separation techniques such as IE or RPC, where there are no means to calibrate these techniques by traditional column calibration methods. This approach has been illustrated by the analysis of heparin,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit227"><sup><span class="sup_ref">227</span></sup></a> a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) for QC purposes by SEC coupled to RI, MALS and ICP-MS. Used in sequence, these detectors provide qualitative molecular weight and quantitative mass content analysis, without the need for authentic standards. The ICP-MS detector was used to determine the cations, which ion-pair with the anionic polysaccharide chains of heparin and LMWHs, whereas the non-specific detectors provide information on the molecular weight and size of the anionic polysaccharides. Full molecular weight (MW) profiles and mass recoveries for three commercial heparin/LMWH products, heparin sodium, enoxaparin sodium and nadroparin calcium, were obtained and all showed higher MWs than previously reported.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Two papers that describe specific new analytical innovations in the area of mass spectrometry hardware for metallomic and metalloproteomic studies, make a welcome addition to the literature. The group of Preisler<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit228"><sup><span class="sup_ref">228</span></sup></a> have followed on from an earlier study on multiply – hyphenated detection series, to produce another iteration, this time coupling an LC separation to ES with a split flow to a commercial MALDI target made of conductive plastic. The target plate is then analysed off-line in a MALDI-MS followed by SALD into an ICP-MS detector. The addition of ES to the series generates multiply charged protein ions and so offers an orthogonal detection method compared to the singly charged molecular ions generated in the MALDI and the elemental ions from the ICP source. Each of the soft ionization techniques, ES and MALDI, offers specific advantages: ES can be easily coupled on-line to an LC column and can be used for analysis of non-covalent protein–metal complexes; MALDI is a simple, quick and sensitive technique, which is generally useful for the identification of substances after direct analysis of their mixtures with a suitable absorbing matrix. The ES source also overcomes to some extent the loss of the metal ion from the protein which often occurs during ionisation in the MALDI source. Separations were performed on a conventionally sized RP HPLC column (Vydac C8 208MS 5415, 150 × 4.6 mm × 5 μm) using a gradient elution over 25 min. Buffer A was composed of 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) in 3% (v/v) MeOH and buffer B contained 5 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) in 50% (v/v) MeOH. The flow from the column was split such that 884 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was directed to the ES source and 16 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was deposited as spots on a plastic MALDI target (Prespotted AnchorChip 96, Bruker, Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The MALDI matrix applied by the manufacturer was washed off and the LC effluent was deposited using a laboratory-built spotter with x, y, z stages. The effluent was spotted in the form of 1.6 μL droplets and dry fractions on the target were overlaid with a 0.5 μL of saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 20% ACN and 1% TFA (v/v) with 1 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> In as the IS for the SALD-ICP-MS. The plate was initially desorbed in the MALDI instrument and then subsequently the same plate was analysed by SALD-ICP-MS to give the elemental composition of the spots. Off-line detection is less straightforward, but it has some advantages compared to on-line coupling including: decoupling of the separation from detection allows for their independent optimization; it is useful to make modifications to the deposited fractions prior to further analysis; storage of the spots is possible; and repeated analyses under various conditions or with other detection techniques can be utilised. The system was tested using a commercially available metallothionein-1 (MT-1) preparation isolated from rabbit liver (purity 98.2%) and chromatograms showed separation of complexes of three major isoforms, MT-1a, MT-2d and MT-2e which eluted at 10.6, 11.2 and 14.0 min, respectively. No apo-protein peaks were observed in the ES mass spectra. The dominant charge states were +4 to +7, the number of detected metal ions in the MT-1 complexes were 2 to 6 for Cd and 1 to 5 for Zn with the total number of metal ions in the complexes 7. Three-point calibration using standards of 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in five replicates for each yielded typically <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> of 0.999. Although the analyte signals were normalised to an In internal standard the repeatability for the Zn and Cd concentrations was quite poor at between 26 and 62% RSD, which can only be described as qualitative. However, it would be interesting to see results from this approach in much simpler scenarios using single protein standards to determine what the system capabilities are for quantitative analysis. No data was given to show how the MALDI step might have affected the amount of material available in the subsequent SALD-ICP-MS analysis, or how this might affect the analytical parameters, particularly the accuracy.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The second paper, from the group led by Doble,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> describes <span class="italic">the use of a microfluidic chip designed for nanospray organic MS in proteomics studies, but instead coupled to an ICP-MS instrument</span>. The authors claim that by using lower flow rates and consequently lower volumes of organic solvents, they can overcome a number of issues related to plasma instability and carbon blocking the sampler cones. However, lowering eluent flow rates to nanoflow causes different issues to be problematic, such as: frequent blocking of the capillary column; requirement for sample pre-concentration with concentrator columns prior to analysis; and the need to minimise dead volumes to avoid band broadening, which can lead to poor separation efficiency. Hyphenation of nanoLC to ICP-MS involves transport of eluents with flow rates as low as 100 nL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> into the plasma, requiring dedicated interfaces with sheath flows to boost flow rates to levels suitable for nebulisation; or employment of sheathless total consumption direct-injection nebulisers, which can also be difficult to use consistently. Some of these practical problems can be overcome by using commercially fabricated microfluidic chip devices, which can dramatically improve separation performance, efficiency and, most importantly, versatility, compared to laboratory built systems. In this study a HPLC-Chip Cube interface (Agilent Victoria, Australia), with a reusable chip was coupled to a HPLC equipped with a nano-pump system. The microfluidic nanospray device was modified by removal of the electrospray and the flow was diverted to an unused stator port on the chip cube interface prior to introduction into the nebuliser. The microfluidic chip consisted of a Polaris C18, 3 μm packing material, a 160 nL enrichment column and a 150 mm analytical column. A total consumption nebuliser (Teledyne CETAC, Omaha, NE USA) was modified to reduce post-column band broadening and the low volume spray chamber was adapted to introduce a makeup flow of argon to aid transport of the eluent aerosol into the plasma at the low flow rates used and stop losses on the spray chamber walls. The instrumental setup was evaluated using a simple experimental procedure for the measurement of cyanocobalamin in horse plasma. It displayed good linearity of 0.9999 with a seven point calibration range from 10 to 1000 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and peak area and retention time RSDs of 1.9% and 0.2% respectively. The LOD was 14 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (0.57 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Co), which was consistent with other methods using larger i.d. columns of 150 mm × 1 mm with direct injection nebulisation. No carbon deposition was observed after 6 weeks of method development and no drift was observed in the baseline. It will be interesting to see how the system handles more complex samples containing a biological matrix and how this affects the resolution between analytes, which was not tested in the current work and the long term routine reliability, particularly in relation to system blockages.</p>

Various cell lysis techniques were investigated in an effort to both maintain the metalloproteins during lysis and subsequent analysis while, at the same time, serving to be strong enough to break the cell wall, allowing access to cytosolic metalloproteins. Seven lysis approaches were assessed, including: glass homogeniser; bead beater; sonication probe; vortex with and without Triton X-100 (1% v/v); and sonication bath followed by vortex, with and without Triton X-100 (1% v/v). A Qubit fluorometric assay was used to determine the concentration of nucleic acids and proteins in the lysate and the concentration of Zn over a wide molecular range was measured using SEC coupled to ICP-MS. As demonstrated by the highest Zn to protein ratio, 1.030 ng Zn per μg protein and Zn distribution among high, mid, and low molecular weights, the lysis method involving vortexing the yeast cells with 500 μm glass beads in Triton X-100 (1% v/v), was found to extract the Zn metalloproteome with the least denaturation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">absolute quantitation of peptides and intact proteins without the need for authentic molecular standards, by “direct” heteroatom analysis using the measurement of P or S by chromatography coupled to ICP-MS</span>, has been the focus of a number of studies, which highlight the range of different application areas where it can be used. The measurement of phosphorylated proteins is a good example of how important ICP-MS has become as an HPLC detector in macromolecular speciation studies, mainly because of its ability as a generic detector for a specific class of analyte, in this case any compound containing P. Its characteristics for quantitation with only an elemental standard and provision of low LODs, even in difficult biological matrices is unsurpassed in the lexicon of MS instrumentation. Whilst the equivalent LC-MS/MS based approach would provide the necessary structural characterisation of the analyte, it would require authentic standards for full quantitation and ion generation would be suppressed by the matrix.

Two methods were used, the first involved the use of HPLC coupled in parallel to ES and ICP-MS to quantify the S-containing peptides obtained after extraction and purification of the cyclic peptides from chemoenzymatic reaction mixtures, the second used NMR to quantify the solution concentration of the non-sulfur containing cyclic peptides. The overall methodology made the quantification of new compounds much easier, as authentic standards were unavailable. Following on from work reviewed last year on “absolute venometrics”, a refinement of the method has been published.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233</span></sup></a> Using triple quadrupole ICP-MS and high resolution molecular MS, it has extended the analysis of snake venom from 25 compounds measured in a single species, to other snake species. Once again the chromatographic resolution of the individual S-containing species restricted total identification of all the compounds. Generally in the biomolecular speciation literature this is the limiting factor and more work needs to be undertaken to develop high resolution separation methods for coupling to the power of ICP-MS detection.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another recently developed approach to the analysis of peptides<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> by ICP-MS, but one which will have much wider application when fully validated, <span class="italic">involves using elemental labelling for the specific detection of a biologically transient species, in this case cysteine sulfenic acid groups (SA, Cys-SOH) in post-translationally modified peptides</span>. These groups are important indicators of reactive oxidation species, which are implicated as causative agents in age related disease states such as Alzheimer’s disease. In a proof of concept report the SA group was generated in model peptides by oxidation with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and then tagged by the linear alkyne beta-ketoester (KE) linked to a lanthanide (Ln)-containing chelator (Ln-DOTA, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid). The linking of the KE to DOTA was performed by click chemistry, resulting in a new reagent (Ln-DOTA-KE) that permits highly sensitive elemental (ICP-MS) and molecular (ESI-MS/MS) detection of SA groups present in proteins. The reagent reacts specifically with SA, offering improved reactivity at physiological pH, an apparently simple derivatisation step and a cell-membrane-permeable compound that has promising future applications. It will be interesting to see whether this generic approach to the measurement of biomolecular species that show a high degree of reactive oxidation, correlates with the diseased state in illnesses associated with this as a causative agent.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect2950"><span class="b_heading">4.1 Interaction of metallodrugs with biological systems</span></h3>
        <span>The <span class="italic">investigation and measurement of the interaction of metallodrugs containing Pt or Ru with biological systems</span> has been the focus of research interest for many years. Recent studies have looked at quantitation, fundamentals of drug–DNA interaction and hyperspectral image analysis of tumour models. A high accuracy species-specific HPLC-ICP-MS method<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit235"><sup><span class="sup_ref">235</span></sup></a> for the quantitation of carboplatin DNA adducts in a lung cell line has been developed. The method involved the use of micro-flow RPC coupled to a SF-ICP-MS instrument (<span class="italic">R</span> = 300), achieving an LOD of 0.2 ng Pt per mg DNA. A low LOD was essential for this work because of the known poor reactivity of the drug towards DNA. To perform IDA, carboplatin–GG calibrants and spikes (<small><sup>194</sup></small>Pt-enriched GG adducts) were synthesised and then characterised for Pt mass fraction, Pt distribution and structural composition. To assess the accuracy of the developed procedure in the absence of a CRM, a “reference” sample prepared by incubation of calf thymus DNA with carboplatin was characterised in house for its total P concentration, Pt content and Pt–GG concentration. This was analysed in parallel, as a form of IQC during the investigation. It will be interesting to see the results from clinical trials involving human samples and how useful such a high accuracy approach is in the clinic. The group of Timerbaev has continued to develop new approaches<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit236"><sup><span class="sup_ref">236</span></sup></a> to the assessment of the properties of a proposed anticancer Ru-based drug, indazolium <span class="italic">trans</span>-[tetrachloridobis(1<span class="italic">H</span>-indazole)ruthenate(<span class="small_caps">III</span>)], in this case how it interacts with a DNA oligonucleotide, in these model experiments 5′-GTCGTACTGATACATGAGCC-3′; 6117 Da, was used. The novelty in the work was the use of affinity CE, to study the Ru DNA-adduct formation <span class="italic">in situ</span> using a capillary filled with an oligonucleotide-containing electrolyte. To further characterise the binding kinetics, a drug–oligonucleotide mixture was incubated for different periods of time, and then ultrafiltration used to separate the sample into two different molecular weight size fractions (&gt;3 and &lt;3 kDa), which were analysed by conventional CE. The time-dependent distribution profiles of the Ru drug were then assessed by CE-ICP-MS, revealing that at least two DNA adducts were present. For coupling both CE systems, a torch with a smaller inlet (1.5 mm) was utilised to minimise the influence of plasma backpressure on the electrophoretic flow and a micro-concentric nebuliser CEI-100 (CETAC, Omaha, NE, USA), was used as the ICP-MS interface. The conventional CE (HP3D CE system, Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) and the affinity CE (CAPEL 105, Lumex, St. Petersburg, Russia) was both performed using fused-silica capillaries of inner diameter 75 μm × 70 cm and samples were introduced into the capillary hydrodynamically. The background electrolyte used was 10 mMNaH<small><sub>2</sub></small>PO<small><sub>4</sub></small> to 10 mM Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>HPO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, 4 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 and the affinity CE separation contained 0.2 μm of the oligonucleotide. A high voltage (10 kV) with a positive polarity was placed at the inlet end of the capillary and a sheath flow of 1 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.4 mM NaCl, 20 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Ge as IS, was used to generate the separations. This approach to monitoring metallodrugs has potential for studying their interaction with cellular constituents and for assessing their intracellular fate. An important demonstration<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit237"><sup><span class="sup_ref">237</span></sup></a> of spatial analysis using a combination of elemental and molecular methods for the investigation of metallodrug interactions to support histopathological studies, has been realised by the incorporation of multivariate statistical methods. Using thin cuts of different tumours and FTIR spectroscopy combined with LA-ICP-MS it was possible to show a correlation between alterations in the average protein secondary structure and Pt distribution, as well as between changes in the cell nuclear morphology and a reduction of physiologically relevant trace elements. FTIR spectroscopy is a non-destructive and label free technique which provides molecular species information. The resonant interaction of molecules with mid-IR radiation results in absorbance spectra and allows for the detection of molecular vibrations characteristic of chemical bonds. The IR spectrum carries information regarding molecular conformation and aggregation of biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. It does not provide any information on the distribution of elements, this is provided by the complementary technique of LA-ICP-MS. The results of this combined analysis suggested different degrees of tumour viability. Further studies are warranted to combine molecular and elemental results and bioinformatics to provide the fullest spatially resolved speciation data.</span>
