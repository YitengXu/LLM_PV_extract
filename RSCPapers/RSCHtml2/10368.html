While each of these application categories is very distinct in terms of the analytical challenges posed, there are a number of common themes than can be identified from an examination of the relevant literature appearing over the review period. The traditional atomic spectrometry techniques (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> AAS, OES, XRF, ICP-MS) are relatively mature, but reports continue to appear that seek to address perceived limitations in sensitivity in certain applications, but increasingly more frequently in relation to sample handling and preparation/extraction methodologies, validation and creation of SRMs and methods. However, it is equally clear that because of that very maturity such techniques are more often cited as analytical reference methods to support the development of other approaches (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> GD-OES, GD-MS, PIXE, PIGE, RBS, SEM-EDS, SIMS, TXRF, micro- and macro-XRF, XAS, XPS) that provide either direct sampling or depth and lateral elemental profiling capabilities. Consequently, a variety of techniques may now be routinely applied within an individual study to characterise samples to the extent it is hard to comment critically on the particular analytical novelty that lies at the heart of the work. It is fair to say that in some cases, the significance of the research now involves revealing the features of the sample (including examining surface modifications, coatings, thin films and multilayers, or even the characteristics of a device, functional component, or object, or complex mixture) rather than in the development of the analytical approach itself. That said, certain trends in technique development still expand the range of applications that can be addressed. For example, interest in LIBS continues to command attention and is heavily cited in most application sections of this review. The technique offers certain unique advantage for elemental analysis in rapid direct sampling, portability and operating in remote and harsh environments (including industrial production) where low level detection is not essential. Clearly sensitivity remains the Achilles' heel for LIBS but developments in measurement technique such as pulse delay are resulting in better optimised procedures. The development in laser solid sampling technology is providing benefits applicable to other techniques such as ICP-MS and newer variants such as laser ionisation MS. Indeed, lasers, flames, plasmas and other electrical discharges have been used regularly in the fabrication of samples. The atomic spectrometry techniques with which they have been associated are now employed to study such production processes <span class="italic">in situ</span>. The development of nanomaterials has given rise to new approaches to particle size distribution and single particle characterisation where the atomic spectrometric determination produces a size rather than a concentration. There is evidence too in the review of research work going on to understand the environmental consequences of the widespread use of new technologies using data analysis approaches to examine source, provenance or impact. Consequently, while the fundamental analytical questions: “What?” and “How much?” continue to be relevant to researchers increasingly these must now be qualified in many situations by providing answers to enquiries such as “Where?” and “How big (or small)?”.</p></div><hr/>
    
      <h2 id="sect359"><span class="a_heading">Foreword</span></h2>
      <span>This is the latest review covering the topic of advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and functional materials. It follows on from last year's review in the series.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a></span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect363"><span class="b_heading">1 Metals</span></h3>
        <span>This review period has seen a very diverse range papers published covering the analysis of metals and alloys. This diversity is reflected by the range of applications in which atomic spectrometry is used and highlights the interdisciplinary importance of this topic.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">There has been a trend in recent years reflecting the growing importance of micro-structural analysis and this continues to be clearly evident in this review period spanning a range of metals. In many modern high performance metals, it is often the type and abundance of particulates such as non-metallic inclusions or intermetallic compounds that determine the desired properties of the metal. As a result, many of these papers are based on a direct analysis from solid samples, which is one of the strongest themes underlying this review.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Metal surface modification and coating deposition have become significant areas of development and of considerable commercial interest. Many of the applications described supported the development of new coatings, novel surface modifications and atomic spectrometric techniques also played a valuable role in assessing in-use performance. Noteworthy papers covering this topic which contribute to the development of new materials and processes are listed in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.</p>

          <span>Analysis of micro-structural features in ferrous materials is of growing importance, with a particular emphasis on non-metallic inclusions such as oxides, sulphides, nitrides and carbides. These can have a critical impact on the design properties of modern high performance steels. In the development of wear resistant stainless steel, Khaki <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> used several spectroscopic techniques to establish the composition and location of Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> inclusions within the matrix of 304 grade stainless steel. Thus EDXRF was used to identify Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> particles evenly distributed within austenite and ferrite phases as determined by XRD. This structure was reported to enhance the hardness and wear resistance of this steel grade.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Detecting nano- and micro-scale particles that are not in a metal matrix is often required when investigating wear. Harrington <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> propose a novel approach of characterising wear particles from stainless steel hip joints generated <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, based on asymmetric field-flow fractionation (AFFF). By combining AFFF with UV, light scattering and ICP-MS detection, the authors were able to establish the size range of Co, Cr and Mo particles (in the range 40–150 nm) and provide an indication of the association of metal ions with transport proteins in serum. The authors claimed that this feasibility study had provided the basis for useful pathological data for <span class="italic">in vivo</span> investigations into the processes which lead to tissue necrosis and artificial joint failure.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In steel production, spark OES is the only technique that can provide analysis at the required level of sensitivity and in a time frame which does not hinder the steel-making processes. Process control analysis is achieved from the discharge of thousands of individual spark excitations to give a single multi-element result. The work of Janis <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> exploited the multi-element measurements from individual spark discharges to qualitatively identify and quantitatively measure the presence of non metallic inclusions in low carbon steels. Individual sparks which encounter inclusions generate high emission intensities from localised high concentration of elements present. Spark discharges on matrix metal generate lower intensities which represent the concentration of each element alloyed in the steel. The authors used this technique to establish the type and distribution of Al and Ca oxide and Ca sulphide based inclusions in steel samples. Good agreement with conventional SEM characterisation was reported. In addition, the authors claimed the size distribution could be measured by Pulse Discrimination Analysis (PDA) and reported the size range for these inclusions was 2 to 13 μm. Thus PDA provided a level of in-process metallurgy in parallel with bulk process control analysis and from the same analytical cycle. Although conventional SEM-based metallography provides the definitive characterisation in steel production it is slow and can only be performed on final product. However, PDA can provide in-process information on the inclusion population and is the only technique currently capable of achieving this. The component of PDA data not emanating from inclusions represents the element concentration alloyed in the matrix metal. The distribution of elements between inclusion population and matrix metal represents an additional level of information relating to the efficiency of alloying during production. This aspect of PDA is currently underexploited and should be explored further. Efforts to improve the detection sensitivity of LIBS continue with many research groups examining the laser operating parameters. Using a dual pulsed laser operating at 1064 nm, Goa <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> demonstrated the effect that pulse energy, inter-pulse delay and optical configuration has on sensitivity. Maximum sensitivity for Cr I (520.84 nm) and Fe I (522.72 nm) in low alloy steel achieved with both pulses operating at 100 mJ. The importance of focusing the initial ablation pulse above the sample surface was reported with the recommendation that the second analytical pulse should be focused 1 mm beyond the sample surface. The emission for Cr showed two maxima from inter-pulse delays of 6 and 15 μs achieving sensitivity enhancement factors of 43 and 49, respectively. Ahmed <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> considered the two main parameters influencing the laser metal interaction: laser wavelength and inter-pulse delay in double-pulse operation. Applying the optimal delay between the initial pulse at 1064 nm and the second pulse at 532 nm was shown to enhance the neutral Fe emission lines by a factor of 30 in comparison to single pulse mode. Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> investigated a spectroscopic approach to establish a basis for improving precision. A multiple-spectral line calibration (MSLC) approach was used in which LIBS intensity ratios were used to train an artificial neural network which was then applied to the analysis of steel samples. The relative performance in terms of precision achieved using this MSLC methodology was compared to that obtained from the conventional approach of internal standardisation. It was found that MSLC improved the RSDs from 11.3% and 19.5%, to 6.4% and 12.9% for Cr and Ni, respectively. Accuracy was measured as the root-mean-square error of cross validation and compared to conventional methods. An improvement in accuracy from 0.018% and 0.067% to 0.010% and 0.023% by weight was reported for Cr and Ni, respectively.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">This year there are fewer papers exploring the fundamentals of laser–sample interactions as a route to achieving improved sensitivity for LIBS. This may indicate that this area of research has matured. However, an increase in LIBS applications for ferrous metals is also apparent in the papers reviewed. The basic principles of LIBS are aligned with application in standoff analysis, and therefore, are uniquely suitable for in-process applications in the harsh environment of metals production. Sun <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> applied LIBS directly to the analysis of molten steel <span class="italic">via</span> a refractory tipped tube. Emission radiation from a double-pulsed laser was collected by a Cassegrain configuration of mirrors to avoid attenuation across the wavelength range. The authors reported a major enhancement in the observed emission intensities for Cr, Mn, Ni, Si and V that was achieved by purging the refractory tipped tube with argon and attributed to improvements in spectroscopic stability. Quantitative performance for these elements was assessed using the univariate and partial least-squares models. The root-mean square error of prediction and the relative standard deviation were reported at 5 and 2–3%, respectively. <span class="italic">In situ</span> LIBS analysis for these elements in molten steel was reported to achieve results comparable to the corresponding plant analysis of solidified samples taken from the melt. The authors also described the quantitative capabilities for carbon analysis in molten steel. Carbon is one of a small number of elements emitting in the UV, is present in low concentrations and is critical to steel products. Thus Yao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> reported that optimising the inter-pulse delay between the initial pulse at 532 nm and the second at 1064 nm produced the highest sensitivity for C detection in molten ferroalloys. Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> highlighted that steel temperature had a considerable influence on the measurement of C when measured in molten ferroalloy using LIBS. Experimental data showed a 4% error between the samples analysed from solidified samples taken from melt, and the corresponding LIBS analysis.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Recycling scrap metal is a major part of steel-making, particularly in stainless steel production where it represents the bulk raw material input into the process. Kashiwakura <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> applied laser induced breakdown spectrometry to identifying the composition of individual pieces of stainless steel scrap.

          <span>As indicated in the previous section on ferrous materials, micro-structural characterisation is of growing importance as metals are developed with advanced properties. Removal of V and Zr impurities from molten aluminium through the addition of B was studied by Khaliq <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> Using EDXRF and electron backscattering diffraction analysis, the authors were able to propose a mechanism for the formation of V and Zr borides from a series of high temperature experiments.

          <p class="otherpara">The application of LIBS to the analysis of non-ferrous metals has increased in popularity. The complex nature of the laser interaction generally makes it necessary to optimise instrument operation for each sample matrix. Thus Hang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> investigated the influence of the laser parameters which contribute to the matrix effect limiting detection sensitivity. A range of 23 standards of different metals were used in this study including: aluminium, copper, nickel, tungsten and zinc. The influence of laser pulse duration was investigated by applying nanosecond and femtosecond lasers to a buffer-gas assisted ionisation source, coupled to a TOF-MS detector. This allowed the relative sensitivity coefficients of each element to be calculated for each metal matrix. Combining this data set with a range of physical properties of each metal provided a data set for orthogonal partial least-squares evaluation. This revealed that the thermal properties of the metal have a strong influence on the matrix effect induced by nanosecond lasers. Additionally, thermal effects induced by femtosecond laser pulses were shown to be significantly less using S-plot evaluation. A theoretical thermodynamic model was developed around the experimental data. The authors claimed that the model could reasonably explain the processes of the matrix effect.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Improvements to sensitivity in laser induced breakdown spectrometry through the use of magnetic field containment was reported by Ding <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> The analysis of an aluminium-lithium alloy using Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) was carried out with and without magnetic containment of the plasma. Emission intensity data from Al and Li were used assess the effect of magnetic containment which was reported to increase sensitivity by a factor of 1.5 to 3 times using a 1.1 T (tesla) field strength. Enhancement to sensitivity was attributed to an increase in density of excited atoms and to increases in electron temperature and density within the plasma due to the magnetic field. Takahashi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> proposed a means of achieving calibration free (CF) LIBS which avoids the need to correct for non-stoichiometric ablation.

Using a range of certified brass standards, the concentration of Cu, Pb and Zn were provided <span class="italic">via</span> the specific CF algorithm and using a laser pulse duration of 250 ns. Relative errors for Cu and Zn were reported as ±3.3% and ±6.4%, respectively. However, an unacceptably large error was reported for Pb. The authors claimed this approach improved the accuracy of CF LIBS by eliminating the need to correct for the effects of differential evaporation and ablation across the elements. It was conceded that this approach was limited to major elements and not suitable for the determination of elements in concentrations of below 10%.</p>

          <span>The application of analytical spectroscopy to archaeological artefacts features strongly in this review period with a clear emphasis on non-invasive and micro-invasive techniques. Mista <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> presented the results of an interdisciplinary study carried out on a range of metallic objects from selected archaeological sites in Poland.

From the range of data generated it was possible to confidently state that the artefacts were produced locally <span class="italic">via</span> secondary smelting processes. This work has parallels with modern metals production as much can be interpreted about processing and casting from solidified samples. Establishing provenance is of immense value to the historical record and one which relies heavily on modern analytical techniques. Lesigyarski <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> carried out a thorough analysis of trace elements in a 4th century Bulgarian gold wreath.

A bivariate plot of Pd and Pt concentrations showed that the gold used in this artefact came from two sources. However, the limited amount of Pt in gold sources from Bulgaria prevented a specific geographical location being identified. Instruments with isotope differentiation capabilities offer an additional insight into the provenance of raw materials used in metals production. For example, Muller <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> used a multi-collector ICP-MS to examine the Pb isotopes in sling shot and other lead objects from the late Roman period.

          <span>The volume of published information relating to crude oils and related petrochemical products continues to fall, possibly due to the global slump in oil price and subsequent lack of investment in research and development. In these challenging times research needs to focus on the problems the industry faces with lack of investment and cost reductions. It is surprising that authors continue to promote expensive, time consuming methods using inappropriate instruments which may be interesting academically but provide no meaningful industrial benefits. Many of these methods achieve limits of detection <span class="italic">etc.</span> worse than currently run routine industry standards. The focus should be on developing smart, elegant, cost effective, time saving analytical solutions. A worthwhile starting point for such developments would be to review not only the academic literature but also ASTM, IP, UOP and other industry standard methods. Those reviewing these papers for publication also need a thorough understanding of current industry standards and practices. Papers were noted in the period under review that should not have passed peer review as there was nothing new or novel beyond the industry standard method they had re-invented. The number of papers relating to coal has increased this year with a large contribution from China. The use of LIBS is currently very popular in this applications but most papers appearing were related to the characterisation of coal rather than to the development of new techniques for analysis. Applications of atomic spectrometric techniques to the characterisation of alternative fuels is also an area of growing activity in which bio fuels feature strongly. Environmental concerns and compliance with new legislation appear to be driving this field forward despite the current low oil price.</span>

This study presents the first high precision measurements of Mo, Ni, and V stable isotopes for a set of globally distributed crude oils. Vanadium stable isotope compositions were presented for crude oils formed from different source rocks spanning the geologic ages Paleozoic to tertiary and were complemented by Ni and Mo stable isotope compositions on a subset of crude oils produced from lacustrine source rocks from the Campos Basin, Brazil. The crude oils spanned a wide range of V and Mo isotope compositions but displayed more restricted Ni stable isotope signatures. The samples were diluted in dichloromethane to produce a homogeneous sample from with aliquots were taken and digested using a microwave. A number of microwave cycles was used to ensure sample digestion and some of the aliquots were recombined to ensure enough of the analyte was in the solution for analysis. Following microwave digestion, samples were transferred to cleaned Savillex beakers and isotopic spikes added prior to ion exchange separation. The isotopic analysis was performed using MC-ICP-MS. The contrasting behaviour of these three isotope systems in this initial dataset provides guidance for future investigation to fully exploit the potential of these new isotopic tracers.</p>

Power plants need to rapidly determine coal quality to optimise the combustion process and the development of an instrument that can meet this requirement would have an immediate impact. Thus Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> have described the development of a coal quality analyser based on LIBS.

Twenty calibration samples and five validation samples were analysed.

Microwave digestion using an acid mixture (8 mL of either 20% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> + 5% HF + 5% H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> or 20% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> + 0.4% NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>HF<small><sub>2</sub></small> + 5% H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) was then applied to the pyrolysed coal residue. Analysis was carried out by ICP-MS. Studies utilising NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>HF<small><sub>2</sub></small> demonstrated that it can be used as a replacement to the highly toxic HF digestion method achieving a quantitative recovery of &gt;95% for most of the elements studied. An alternative method for the analysis of S in coal samples using H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and microwave digestion was described by Mketo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48</span></sup></a> S recoveries of 89–101% were achieved on CRM's (SARM 18, 19 and 20) using a microwave temperature of 150 °C, an extraction time of 5 minutes and a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration of 3 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Analysis was performed using ICP-OES. The limit of detection achieved was 0.014 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The proposed method converted all S species to sulphates, as confirmed by IC analysis. Finally, Vogt <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> described a method for the direct quantitative multi element analysis of coal by ETV-ICP-OES. The ETV unit was coupled to the ICP-OES using PFA transport tubing and a cold argon gas flow was used to transport the dry aerosol to the plasma. Both axial and radial ICP-OES instruments were investigated. The ETV program consisted of a relatively slow heating rate to prevent a detector overflow due to the relatively high concentrations of the analytes in the samples. Emission lines with low sensitivity and wide linear dynamic range were chosen to accommodate the high sample input to the plasma. The elements investigated (18) were Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Ti, V and Zn. Calibration lines were achieved by using coal reference materials of different ranks from lignite to semi-anthracite. Linear calibrations over three to four orders of magnitude were obtained. Two coal reference materials NIST 1632d and NIST 1635a were used to verify the accuracy of the method. Recoveries ranged from 80–114% for NIST 1632d and from 98 to 120% for NIST 1635a. This method would appear to be a suitable, quick, cost effective alternative to the complex digestion methods commonly used for coal analysis.</p>

            <span>The analysis of organic samples by ICP has increased over the past years.

The review, which covers both ICP-OES and ICP-MS is comprehensive containing 478 references. Theoretical considerations are explored in the first part of the review including the effects of organic matrices on ICP techniques from aerosol generation to atomization; excitation and ionization process; special distribution of carbon species and analytes in plasma, and spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic carbon-related interferences. The second part of the review is focused on practical considerations for the analysis of organic matrices, optimization and analytical strategies for analyte quantification.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">The importance of halogenated compounds is becoming more prevalent in different application fields. Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> described a novel high-sensitivity elemental ionization source compatible with available mass spectrometers for quantitative detection of organo-halogens. A helium–oxygen plasma was used for atomization followed by negative ion formation in plasma afterglow. This configuration is known as plasma-assisted reaction chemical ionization (PARCI). The effect of oxygen in the ionization process was evaluated in order to understand and optimize the ion generation process. The authors claimed that the improvement of oxygen addition to helium plasma is due to electron transfer reagent ions and minimal interactions of organo-halogen breakdown products with the plasma wall tubes. The improved PARCI system described was coupled to a GC for quantitative determination at sub-picogram levels for fluorinated, chlorinated and brominated compounds.</p>

            <p class="otherpara">The technique of LIBS continues to be applied to the detection of explosives. Consequently, several papers in this review period focused on fundamental studies of the processes occurring within LIBS plasmas in such applications. Standoff LIBS has been applied by Rao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit317"><sup><span class="sup_ref">317</span></sup></a> to record the spectra of seven energetic molecules belonging to the family of nitroimidazoles. The authors exploited the use of femtosecond (fs) and nanosecond (ns) pulses in aim to gain understanding of the interaction of fs pulses with material surface, environmental conditions (air, argon) and pulse durations. A deeper understanding of fs and ns data correlating with molecular structure and surrounding environment is fundamental in the application of LIBS for the detection of explosives and harmful materials. The authors synthesized and characterized seven nitroimidazoles in the lab, prepared as pellets with a diameter of approx. 12 mm and weight between 600 to 800 mg with a thickness of 2–3 mm. The fs LIBS spectra were analyzed for understanding the behavior of molecular (CN, C2 and NH) and atomic (C, H, N and O) emission in air and argon atmospheres. The CN emission was found to be dominant for ablations in air and C2 emissions in argon. The authors used normalized intensities to improve the correlation between atomic emission intensities and the corresponding stoichiometric values. A good correlation coefficient was reported for all ratios in argon atmosphere. The studies of this research group suggested that the atomization/fragmentation ratio could be used as a detection capability of trace explosive molecules.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Rao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> used also fs LIBS in a study of even explosive molecules of nitropyrazole in three different atmospheres: ambient air, nitrogen and argon. In order to understand the plasma dynamics, the decay times of molecular and atomic emissions in the different atmospheres were determined from the spectral data. The researchers investigated correlation between decay times and molecular emission intensities with respect to the number of nitro groups, atmospheric nitrogen content and the oxygen balance of the molecules.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">In a different paper Serrano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit83"><sup><span class="sup_ref">83</span></sup></a> presented a fundamental study on the formation routes of CH, NH and OH radicals in fs LIBS of molecular solids. In this work the author monitored time integrated optical emissions from fs laser produced plasma of isotopically labelled urea, terephthalic acid and anthracene, in pellet form. The different routes were identified by comparison of isotopic patterns. The NH emissions were mainly contributed from native bonding, when present. Atmospheric oxygen formed OH radicals with native H atoms from the molecules. This work may be another important step towards the use of molecular emissions arising from the LIBS of organic molecules as diagnostic tool. The authors reflected on further investigations to be carried out on the progress of these formation routes depending on the ablation regime (ultrashort and short laser pulses).</p>

            <span>Legislation that regulates the elemental impurities levels in pharmaceutical samples is currently undergoing revision from limits based on elemental concentration in components of drug products to limits based on element specific permitted daily exposures. This initiative is likely to have significant implications for the workload of analytical laboratories going forward, potentially requiring the development of new methods to satisfy regulations. A survey published by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> summarizes elemental impurities concentrations in common pharmaceutical excipients and some drug substances. Closed vessel digestion followed by ICP-MS determination was carried out in 205 samples. Discussion of some of the analytical challenges encountered and some potential solutions were also presented.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">A simple and fast method for the determination of Cr in empty medicine capsules was presented by Goncalves <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> The procedure may be considered as an alternative to current USP determination of trace impurities in drug compounds and excipients based on ICP techniques. The authors used tungsten coil atomic emission spectrometry (WC-AES) and matrix decomposition directly on the tungsten atomizer. Tungsten filaments extracted from 150 W, 15 V microscope light bulbs were used as atomizer and excitation source for AE measurements. A Czerny–Turner spectrograph and a thermoelectrically-cooled CCD detector were part of the instrumental setup. The accuracy of the method was checked by ICP-OES determination. Sample preparation consisted on 10 min vortex of 0.4 g of sample with HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Limits of detection reported were 0.4 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, linear dynamic range between 3–100 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and precision (RSD) given in the range 5.2 to 7.4%. The authors claimed that the system was portable and may be applied in the field for fast determinations.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The use of portable instrumentation for biopharmaceutical products has been demonstrated in a paper by Mondia <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> The system was used to determine trace levels from 0.5 ppm V to 100 ppm Mo in different nutrient powders in cell culture media. A hand held XRF with a Rh X-ray tube and a silicon drift detector was used for the analysis. In order to overcome Bremsstrahlung continuum effects due to backscattered X-rays, a wavelet transformation with normalization to the Compton peak intensity was proposed, removing in this way high frequency noise from the spectrum. This is the first time wavelet transformation with spectral normalization is used in pharmaceutical samples for high accuracy results. The accuracy of the method was determined by comparison with ICP-MS data. For Cu and Zn results were within 20%. Challenges related to matrix effects were compensated by analyzing samples in a finely grained powder state and sealed samples under a dry environment to minimize errors associated with increased water content. <span class="small_caps">L</span>-Glutamine powdered reference standard spiked with different concentrations of the metal solutions were used for calibration of the instrument.

The resulting Fe(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) was complexed with thiocyanate in the presence of sodium chloride. The remaining Fe(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) was aspirated into an air–acetylene flame and determined by AAS. The authors also reported the validation of a kinetic method for determination of salbutamol based on the bromination of the drug by bromine generated <span class="italic">in situ</span> by the interaction of bromate with bromide in acidic medium. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically as the absorbance of bromine color at 380 nm decreased with the time.

The proposed method is based on direct measurement of drug distribution using a focused X-ray beam to stimulate X-ray fluorescence from the bromine in a solution containing 85% HFA, 15% ethanol and 1% IPBr. The technique is not restricted to IPBr since any other drug that contains atoms with suitable fluorescence energy could be targeted.</p>

            <span>Concerns about the safety of cosmetic products are increasing and several countries around the world specify different regulations for cosmetic materials. Toxic elements including As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb and Sb in cosmetic are banned as intentional ingredients. However, they may be present as impurities as contaminants in raw materials or as by-products of manufacturing processes.</span>

ICP-OES operational conditions were optimized using a fractional factorial design studying nine variables: integration time, emission lines, sample introduction flow rate, sample flow rate during the analysis, pump stabilization time, radio frequency applied, gas flow rates (auxiliary, nebulizer and cooling). As analytical signals were recorded sequentially in axial and radial viewings, desirability function optimisation was used by the authors to establish the best instrumental conditions for the analytes (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb). The Pb was determined by GFAAS due to difficulties arising from spectral interferences in the ICP-OES analysis.</p>

            <span>Advances in the field of mobile instrumentation applied to art and archaeology analysis include the development of a portable X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence system based on energy dispersive detection in reflection geometry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> This new system was proposed with the aim of overcoming the existing limitations that portable XRF and XRD instruments present such as the use of low-energy X-rays, long data acquisition times and relatively heavy weights for practical use. The authors developed two instruments based on ED XRD-XRF detection. The first one was only used for laboratory tests. In the second one an X-ray tube (Ag anode) and a Si drift detector were mounted on an automated goniometer. The system was constructed as an open-work platform allowing the analysis of object with complex geometries. A powdered quartz sample was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed EDXRD portable system. In order to test the XRF performance, two certified standard glasses NIST 610 and NIST 612 were analysed. Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Pb, Th, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb and Mo were detected at 500 ppm level and the first instrument detected trace elements at 50 ppm because the distance between the detector and sample is smaller than in the second instrument. Sensitivity was improved by using filters. A model of fresco sample with known composition of calcite, quartz and hematite was also analyzed. Results showed identification of crystalline phases in shorter time (100–600 s) than so far reported. Other applications presented in this paper included the identification of minerals in stone objects (green minerals and obsidians) for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, pigments, inert materials in layers of paintings and analysis of bones and teeth for paleodiet studies.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">A review article by Vandenabeele and Donais<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> which includes 160 references summarizes recent studies on direct analysis of cultural heritage materials and archaeometry research using mobile instrumentation. Applications, advantages and disadvantages of the different analytical techniques were presented. It was observed that Raman spectroscopy, XRF, FTIR and LIBS were the most used techniques in the field. Other less common reported spectroscopic techniques as well as combined approaches were noted.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">An interesting application of LIBS for <span class="italic">in situ</span> analysis to identify pigments from mural paintings was used by Syvilay <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> The authors presented a novel strategy to overcome the variations of LIBS signal. A standard normal variate (SNV) method was applied and evaluated in detail for the first time on LIBS spectra. Parameters studied included energy of laser, shot by shot and quantification. The aim of the method was to get a quick visualization of the different layers of a stratigraphic painting by simple data representations (2D and 3D) after SNV normalization.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">In the field of cultural heritage objects analysis, XRF has become a very powerful tool. But one of the limitations is the presence of absorption effects between adjacent pigment layers which are manifested by artifacts that impede a proper identification of images.

The MFGDP was developed by the same authors in previous work as an ion source to absorb and ionize the sample. Operating conditions were optimised for the MFGDP (sample distance from plasma, speed, and sequence) and for the ion trap as mass spectrometer conditions (capillary temperature and voltage, tube lens and multipole). Handwritten samples containing 70 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of urea were analyzed. Although resolution was 300 μm under optimum conditions, the proposed method could distinguish between different handwriting according to the “fingerprints” of chemical substances and obtain distribution of the different nutrients in the sample. The aim of the authors for the future is to improve resolution by obtaining a more uniform plasma plume.</p>

          <span>The analysis of nuclear materials has again been dominated by standoff techniques such as LIBS to minimise the workers' exposure to radiation. This is especially true for the analysis of reactor components.

            <span>A number of reviews covering different aspects of the analysis of nuclear materials have been published in this review period. Two reviews/overviews covered nuclear forensics or safeguards. One entitled “nuclear forensics: what, why and how?”,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152</span></sup></a> containing 73 references, discussed how the aim of this type of work is to determine the origin of the material and to identify when it was last chemically processed or purified (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> its age) so that nuclear proliferation can be deterred. A wide range of techniques may be used for this purpose and a discussion was presented of how gamma spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (multi-collector ICP-MS, TIMS, <span class="italic">etc.</span>), Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, TEM and LIBS may be employed to ensure that maximum information is obtained. A combination of these techniques enables both structure, morphology, isotopic composition of the main component and the level of impurities to be determined. Also discussed, albeit briefly, were inter-laboratory comparisons and an outlook to the future. The other review,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">153</span></sup></a> containing 146 references, was more specialised and assessed “mass spectrometric analysis for nuclear safeguards”. This review covered the application of SIMS, TIMS and ICP-MS. Each of these techniques was discussed in detail, giving examples of their use for the analysis of nuclear materials as well as environmental samples. Different measurement strategies and modifications of each technique, methods of overcoming interferences and relative advantages were all discussed. The review also contained a substantial section covering current challenges, relevant certified materials and potential improvements.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">One review highlighted that, because of a paucity of relevant CRMs, ensuring valid analytical measurements of nuclear materials and of isotope analysis can be problematic.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">154</span></sup></a> Experimental approaches envisaged at the European Commission Joint Research Centre – Institute for transuranium elements were assessed for overcoming this problem. Amongst the techniques discussed were alpha- and gamma-spectrometry, SF-ICP-MS and high resolution ICP-OES. In another review, containing 122 references, the state of the art in the determination of <small><sup>135</sup></small>Cs and <small><sup>137</sup></small>Cs in environmental samples was described.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> The origins of these isotopes, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> weapons testing, nuclear re-processing, nuclear fuel cycle discharges and accidents and the different techniques available for the measurements were discussed. Although ICP-MS was the focus of the review article, RIMS, TIMS, AMS and NAA were all considered. For all of the mass spectrometric methods, the separation of the analytes from the matrix and concomitant elements is required to ensure that no interferences (such as isobaric interferences from <small><sup>135</sup></small>Ba and <small><sup>137</sup></small>Ba) occur. Methods for the elimination of such interferences including acid digestion methods followed by ion exchange chromatographic separation, chemical separation using ammonium molybdophosphate or insoluble hexacyanoferrates or extraction chromatography were assessed. The utility of ICP-MS using a reaction cell was also considered.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Several papers concerning the development of certified reference materials have also been published including one describing the production of a highly enriched <small><sup>134</sup></small>Ba material for use as a CRM for ID-MS measurements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit156"><sup><span class="sup_ref">156</span></sup></a> This approach was proposed to help quantify <small><sup>137</sup></small>Ba so that accurate age measurements using <small><sup>137</sup></small>Cs/<small><sup>137</sup></small>Ba can be made. The processes used to prepare, separate and isolate the isotope were all given. The characterization for isotope amount ratios of three materials: CRM 112 A (uranium (normal) metal assay and isotopic standard); CRM 115 (uranium (depleted) metal assay and isotopic standard) and CRM 125 A (uranium (UO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) pellet assay, isotopic and radiochemical standard) has also been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> Three different TIMS approaches were employed, including a) the total evaporation technique (measurement of major isotope ratio amounts), (b) the modified total evaporation technique (measurement of major and minor isotope ratio amounts) and (c) a conventional TIMS method was used for measuring the minor isotope ratio amounts. The uncertainty values for the measurements were calculated using the combined TIMS data sets and using the ISO guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements. A similar approach was taken during the development of the materials IRMM-019 to IRMM-29.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">158</span></sup></a> These materials are a series of uranium hexafluorides that were certified for their isotopic composition using the modified total evaporation process for TIMS.

The measurements were confirmed by UF<small><sub>6</sub></small> gas source mass spectrometry. The major isotope ratio amounts were determined with an uncertainty ranging (<span class="italic">k</span> = 2) from 0.015–0.03%, whereas the minor isotope ratio amounts (<small><sup>234</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U and <small><sup>236</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U) had uncertainties of 0.02–3%.</p>

In the latter paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit160"><sup><span class="sup_ref">160</span></sup></a> the homogeneity of the crystals was determined using several techniques including EPMA (for the major element concentrations) whereas LA-ICP-MS and ID-ICP-MS were used for the U isotopic ratios. The ID-ICP-MS results were obtained following random selection of fragments of between 28 and 100 μg from the crystal followed by acid dissolution and spiking of enriched <small><sup>235</sup></small>U, <small><sup>230</sup></small>Th and <small><sup>149</sup></small>Sm. Accuracy was ensured through the analysis of the NIST SRM 612 glass.

            <span>The use of X-ray fluorescence spectrometry for the analysis of nuclear fuels continues to be the subject of research. In one such study, the compositional analysis of mixed uranium–thorium oxide powders, microspheres and pellets was undertaken using TXRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit163"><sup><span class="sup_ref">163</span></sup></a> No dissolution was required. Instead, the sample supports were gently rubbed on the sample and this led to sufficient sample transfer to the support for the analysis to be undertaken. An alternative approach was to make a very dilute slurry of sample and then place an aliquot of this on the support. Drying this led to a thin film of sample that was also sufficient for analysis and that minimised matrix effects. The determination of U in samples where it was present at major and trace component levels were made using Th as an internal standard. The average relative precision achieved using the method was 2.6% and the U concentrations determined experimentally deviated by no more than 5% from expected values. As an extra validation step, the TXRF data were compared with those obtained using biamperometry, and good agreement was achieved. A further paper reported on the use of XRF in the determination of Pu in spent nuclear fuel.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit164"><sup><span class="sup_ref">164</span></sup></a> A modification of monochromatic WDXRF, referred to as hiRX (high resolution X-ray) was described. Spiked surrogate spent fuels were used as calibration standards and the method was applied to actual spent fuel samples, where as little as 39 ng of Pu could be detected. The precision of the method was good (2% RSD), but accuracy was variable, with values ranging from 4–27% from expected values. The LOD for Pu when using an excitation spot of 200 μm and a time of 100 s was 375 pg. The authors highlighted the speed, non-destructive nature and improved sensitivity of the method.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Finally, the application of a high resolution ICP-OES method to the determination of Pu in samples originating from the nuclear fuel cycle has been described.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> The exceptionally line-rich concomitant elements such as Am, Np, Th and U can complicate the emission spectrum and consequently much of the study focused on identifying Pu wavelengths that were not interfered with. Forty-three wavelengths were identified of which the most prominent 27 were investigated with respect to their SBR, slope (counts per mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and line width. Use of a desolvating nebuliser was observed to improve the LOD by an order of magnitude compared with previous studies. The LOD for the most sensitive lines were reported as 2.3, 3.1 and 3.2 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 299.649, 299.409 and 297.251 nm, respectively. Precision using external calibration for samples containing approximately 0.45 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was typically better than 2%. Accuracy was ensured by using standard additions calibration and also by verification using a SF-ICP-MS instrument.</p>

            <span>Nuclear forensics, safeguards and the analysis of environmental particles has been one of the most popular areas of research during this review period. Two review papers relevant to this section were published.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">152,153</span></sup></a> These were discussed previously, in Section 3.1.1.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Automated screening of individual uranium particles was undertaken using TIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a> An automated particle measurement screening software that had previously been designed to work with SIMS instrumentation was utilised. The problem with SIMS analysis is that hydride-based polyatomic interferences can be problematic. The authors therefore coupled their screening methodology with TIMS, which eliminated these interferences. Consequently, those samples that gave dubious ratios when <small><sup>234</sup></small>U and <small><sup>236</sup></small>U were determined using SIMS, gave more accurate and precise measurements when using TIMS.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The age of individual uranium–plutonium particles with varying U/Pu ratios (1–70) were determined using ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">167</span></sup></a> The micron-sized particles were prepared from U and Pu certified materials where the Pu material was known to have last been purified on July 14<small><sup>th</sup></small> 2008. The authors determined the purification age experimentally using <small><sup>241</sup></small>Am/<small><sup>241</sup></small>Pu using high resolution ICP-MS equipped with a desolvation system to ensure that hydride-based interferences were minimised. After dissolution of the particles, picogram to femtogram levels of Am, Pu and U were separated using a small anion exchange column. The <small><sup>241</sup></small>Am/<small><sup>241</sup></small>Pu were determined accurately by spiking pure <small><sup>243</sup></small>Am into the sample solution. The experimentally derived ages were in good agreement with the expected age, with the difference being only 0.27 years. Another paper described the isotopic analysis of individual particles using single particle ICP-MS for nuclear safeguards purposes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> In this study, erbium oxide powder dispersed in water was used as a surrogate for uranium particles. To correct for mass bias, Er solution was run before and after particle analysis. Two data processing strategies were adopted to calculate the erbium isotope ratios. One was point by point (PBP) and the other was linear regression slope (LRS). Precision for <small><sup>170</sup></small>Er/<small><sup>166</sup></small>Er, <small><sup>168</sup></small>Er/<small><sup>166</sup></small>Er and <small><sup>167</sup></small>Er/<small><sup>166</sup></small>Er determined using PBP were 5.5, 4.6 and 3.9%, respectively, improving to between 0.2–4% once mass bias had been corrected for. The same precision measurements obtained using LRS were better by at least an order of magnitude, with a value of 0.3% being typical. In addition, the <small><sup>162</sup></small>Er/<small><sup>166</sup></small>Er could also be determined, which was impossible using PBP. According to the authors, the method enabled fast screening, had sensitive detection, enabled isotopic identification, employed a simple sample preparation thereby reducing contamination and was applicable to particles over a large size range.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The use of SIMS in application to nuclear safeguards work is relatively common. The challenge in this analysis, especially when measuring the minor isotopes <small><sup>234</sup></small>U and <small><sup>236</sup></small>U, is the counting statistics because of the extremely low level of U present, typically 1 pg. Thus an approach based on multiple ion counting strategies for SIMS has been described in which several different instrumental configurations were compared.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> These configurations included static multi-collector, dynamic multi-collector and single collector using peak jump analysis. The precisions of the isotope ratios were measured on CRM U010 and CRM U100 for all of the configurations. The ratios and precisions for each were observed to be similar. However, the authors identified several fundamental properties of each system that affect the overall uncertainty including detector drift and aging effects.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The spatio-temporal evolution of U emission from laser induced plasmas has been studied.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">170</span></sup></a> Analytes such as Pu produce very crowded spectra and when combined with line broadening phenomena induced by ambient atmospheric operation may cause problems in achieving sufficient spectral resolution may be encountered.

Linewidths increased with increasing pressure because of Stark broadening. However, the extent of the broadening observed for U was significantly less than for other analytes such as Ca. The presence of an inert gas decreased the persistence of U in the plasma.</p>

The LIBS derived data for D and deposited Be were also in agreement with the results found using SIMS, with the top part of tile 1 and the bottom part of tile 3 containing the largest amounts. A schematic diagram of the experimental setup was provided in the paper. In a second report, a double pulse from a Nd:YAG laser (schematic diagram of the setup provided) was used to determine the tritium (<small><sup>3</sup></small>H) content.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> In addition, three other analytes were also determined (Al, Ca and W).

The operating procedure was optimised and the inter-pulse delay was tested over the range 20 ns to 80 ms. A delay of 300 ns was subsequently used for the analysis. Results obtained using LIBS were in good agreement with those obtained from XRF that were derived post-mortem. The effects of a magnetic field on the LIBS signal obtained when analysing ITER-like deposits was the subject of another study.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> A significant enhancement in spectral emission was observed and greater penetration depth were obtained in the presence of a magnetic field. This was attributed to greater confinement of the plasma by the magnetic field leading to higher electron impact excitation. The LIBS measurements made in the laboratory and from the TEXTOR tokamak were in good agreement when similar conditions were used. Unsurprisingly, the authors noted that signal enhancement could be problematic when the sample was measured quantitatively <span class="italic">in situ</span> if standardisation was not conducted in the presence of a magnetic field.</span>

Optimization of the number of laser shots, laser energy and acquisition time delay was undertaken. A multivariate partial least squares regression calibration approach was adopted that used spectral truncation to minimise problems caused by the complex emission spectrum from the sample. Standard error of prediction (SEP) values were used as figures of merit for the calibration. The average accuracy and precision were found to be 3–8% and 5–10%, respectively, for the analytes measured.</p>

          <span>As discussed in previous reviews in this series, ceramics are designed to be thermally and chemically rather inert. It is therefore exceptionally difficult to digest them so that they may be analysed using liquid-based atomic spectrometric sampling techniques. Consequently, the trend towards the use of solid sampling approaches has continued in the year under review. Only a modest number of papers were published concerning analytical advances in relation to the characterisation of industrial ceramics. Significantly greater attention continues to be paid to the study of historical ceramics.</span>

The samples (ranging in size from 1 to 8 nm) were introduced as aqueous suspensions and calibration was against external aqueous standards. The optimal results for Si were achieved using the mixed modifier 5 μg Pd and 5 μg Mg, whereas for Al, the optimum was 10 μg of Mg only. However, the use of no modifier enabled ash temperatures of 1200 °C for Si and 1300 °C for Al and the compromise atomize temperature of 2400 °C for both analytes. The upper limit of the calibration range was 0.25 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Al and 2 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Si, indicating that significant dilution of the suspensions was required.

            <span>Like forensic samples, historic artefacts are precious in that they can provide significant amounts of contextual information beyond that of their composition alone. Consequently, their destruction should be avoided if at all possible. This means that solid sampling techniques that cause minimal damage, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LA, LIBS and varying forms of XRF are usually used. Those papers that also utilize chemometric analysis of the analytical data to elucidate provenance, trade routes <span class="italic">etc.</span>, are also discussed below. The majority of these types of papers are in archaeological-based journals and so sometimes the analytical science can be lacking in detail.

            <p class="otherpara">Two reviews relevant to the topic of historical ceramics have been published during this ASU review period. The first, entitled “Using non-destructive portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometers on stone, ceramics, metals and other materials in museums: advantages and disadvantages”, contained 87 references.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">189</span></sup></a> It was noted that over the last decade, these instruments have enabled the non-destructive analysis of samples <span class="italic">in situ</span>, on virtually any sized sample and in a very rapid manner (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> hundreds of samples may be analysed on a daily basis). However, it also highlighted that precision can be erratic, sensitivity can be limited and the accuracy of the data can occasionally be questionable. The limitation of performing surface analysis on a sample that could potentially be heterogeneous was also assessed. The other review was a more general one entitled “analytical chemistry in the field of cultural heritage” (377 refs).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit190"><sup><span class="sup_ref">190</span></sup></a> This review covered molecular and atomic-based techniques as well as chemometric tools for data analysis. The primary focus was on the impacts of environmental stressors, the chemical reactions the sample may undergo in its environment and remediation methodologies.</p>

            <span>Atomic spectrometry in almost all its forms continues to be an enabling technology that is crucial enabling the development of new semiconductor materials. The previously observed trend towards the use of a multiplicity of atomic and molecular techniques (often as many as 10) in characterising a newly created material continues. While a significant volume of literature in such applications has been reported in the year under review, much of it is not analytically novel, beyond the unique qualities of the materials themselves.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Advances in research into novel approaches to the characterisation of semiconductor materials is now firmly focused on addressing the technical challenges posed by ultra-thin film and multi-layered functional materials. As a consequence, atomic spectrometry techniques which can provide not only quantification but spatially resolved analysis are now predominant in this field. For example, laser induced breakdown spectrometry has been applied to the characterisation of zirconium oxide thin films (40 nm) deposited on silicon chips.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit207"><sup><span class="sup_ref">207</span></sup></a> The effect of LIBS experimental conditions such as laser energy and focus to sample distance and gate delay were investigated. It was found that the focus to sample distance had the greatest influence on plasma formation and resultant spectra produced. An RSD of the order of 1.6% was reported for the Zr peak signal. Using a single pulse and a low ablation energy the system was shown to be capable of quantitative and qualitative analysis of this type of thin film. The application of grazing-incidence XRF and NEXAFS to the depth profiling of complex nano-layer structure has been described by Pollakowski and Beckhoff.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit208"><sup><span class="sup_ref">208</span></sup></a> The combination of the two techniques was used to examine buried thin films and interfaces non-destructively. Model systems (consisting of a carbon cap layer, two titanium layers differing in their oxidation states and separated by a thin carbon layer, and a silicon substrate covered with molybdenum and a carbon layer) were used to develop a differential approach that allowed the chemical species of the titanium multilayer structures to be derived.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Secondary ion mass spectrometry is often the technique of choice for high sensitivity characterisation of complex thin film systems and reports on this type of application continue to appear in the literature. Thus an investigation of depth profiling of Ta/Si multilayer materials by TOF-SIMS has been reported by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209</span></sup></a> A model for depth profile reconstruction was developed and applied to already measured sputter depth profiles generated using a 1 keV energy Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam at an incident angle of 45°. The samples contained 10 alternating layers of Si (105 nm thick) and Ta (7.5 nm thick). The mixing roughness information depth model took into account a decrease of sputtering rate with depth, preferential sputtering of Si and a time dependent matrix effect on Si<small><sup>+</sup></small> intensity. It was established that similar depth resolution for the Si and Ti layers and that depth resolution increased with sputter depth (4.2 to 6.8 nm for 50 s and 300 s sputtering time respectively). Using the model, it was possible to achieve a full reconstruction of the measured profiles of the Si and Ti layers, with an average error of =±5%.</p>

            <span>The literature relevant to the analysis of solar cell and photovoltaic materials is now dominated by studies of Cu(In,Ga)Se<small><sub>2</sub></small> (CIGS) absorber material hetero-structures and thin films. Since these materials are likely to be incorporated in next generation solar devices, a follow-on review by Abou-Ras <span class="italic">et al.</span> comparing laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and grazing-incidence X-ray fluorescence analysis in such applications is timely.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> This article supplements another related review in published 2011 comparing 18 other techniques for the analysis of CIGS materials [Microscopy and Microanalysis/Volume 17/Issue 05/September 2011, pp. 728–751]. The literature in the year under review in this ASU broadly reflect the range of options available for and used in such applications. For example, an investigation of analytical precision of LIBS in the characterisation of CIGS thin films has been published by In <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit212"><sup><span class="sup_ref">212</span></sup></a> The thin films were examined using laser energies and gate delays in the range 0.16 to 2.9 mJ and 0.12 to 3.6 μs respectively, and utilising two ablation spot sizes (42 and 104 μm). The contribution to overall RSD of the measurement from the intensified CCD detector shot noise was estimated using a stable light source for intensity calibration in order to develop a linear model that related detector noise to signal intensity. The shot noise RSD contribution was then subtracted from the overall signal RSD (or that from intensity ratios) to derive the contribution made to variability by ablation plasma fluctuation alone. It was reported that the laser plasma-induced RSD based on intensity ratio measurement was significantly affected by the choice of gate delay time and tended to increase with both gate delay time and laser fluence. Variations in plasma induced RSD found in application to the analysis of CIGS thin films were attributed to the spectral features associated with material composition.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">A range of surface analysis techniques have been applied to the quantification and depth profiling of matrix elements and trace impurities in CIGs photovoltaic absorber materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> Sample thin films were prepared on molybdenum back contacts deposited on soda lime substrates. The bulk concentration of the matrix elements was determined by ICP-OES, XRF and EPMA. The films were further characterised using TOF-SIMS, magnetic sector SIMs, AES and APT for depth profiling. It was concluded that APT could be used to generated 3D elemental compositional maps with sub nm resolution while the high sensitivity of SIMS allowed the creation of trace element depth profiles in parallel. The application of ion beam techniques to the analysis of solar cells incorporating CIGS film absorber layer materials has been described.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> The 2 μm thin films were characterised using RBS and PIXE using helium ions to provide quantitative elemental depth profiles. The techniques were applied to both directly accessible single and double absorber layers and to absorbers buried within solar cells. The spectral data from both techniques were analysed together to produce best fit profile. The results produced from this combined approach for a number of samples were validated by use of a synchrotron sources grazing incidence XRF method and the results derived were in agreement within quoted uncertainties for the techniques.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">A potentially important new method for depth profiling of photovoltaic absorbers based on the sequential combination of GD-OES and XPs has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit215"><sup><span class="sup_ref">215</span></sup></a> In this approach the GD was used to sputter through the material to reach critical buried areas of the CIGS material that could then be examined directly by high resolution XPS depth profiling. Thin film (2.5 μm) samples were prepared on molybdenum covered glass and profiled using GD-OES (4 mm diameter anode, pressure of 350 Pa, pulsed rf power source (35 W). Crater profiling by XPS was carried out using an argon ion source operating with 2 keV, 10 mA bean energy. XPS was also carried out on a CIGS sample chemically etched using HBr/Br<small><sub>2</sub></small> acidic solutions for comparative purposes. It was found, unsurprisingly, that GD sputtering caused significant chemical and morphological changes at the crater surface. These changes were influenced by the choice of GD sputtering gas and the plasma temperature. It was reported that employing a GD with flow inversion prevented the deposition of metallic particulates in the sputter crater allowing subsequent XPS analysis close to the original CIGS composition to be conducted. It was also noted that GD-OES analysis could be successfully restarted after XPS examination, potentially allowing further access to deeper layers of the material. It was suggested that remaining issues identified related to restoring GD crater surfaces to a pristine condition could be addressed by mild, rapid chemical etching or by sputtering using a cluster ion source. An <span class="italic">in situ</span> temperature stage has been designed that allows direct measurements to be made by synchrotron X-ray spectromicroscopy during device processing.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a> The system was applied to the characterisation of CIGS thin films during a heating regime representative of industrial fabrication conditions. The construction materials were selected to allow operation under non-oxidising atmosphere conditions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> in the presence of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>S). It was reported that the system was able to provide information on nanoscale material defects within the resolution of the technique (125 nm). A combination of Raman Spectroscopy and XRF has been applied to the non-destructive analysis of CIGS films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit217"><sup><span class="sup_ref">217</span></sup></a> Thus a reference free XRF method was used to determine the surface and bulk elemental composition of the films.

Metrological scanning force microscopy was used to calibrate the lateral dimensions of the sample in a manner traceable to international standards. This approach allowed the Raman mappings to be converted into a quantitative determination of surface coverage values, with an associated uncertainty budget. It was suggested that the method was suitable for monitoring quality control of CIGs film formation.</p>

            <span>There continues to be significant activity reported in the characterisation of electronic materials at the component or device level.

It was found that there was a linear increase in the bulk Li, Mn and P content of anodes with ageing time. Vertical depth profiles of these elements were obtained using GD-OES allowing the variation in surface and bulk composition to be correlated with the electrical performance of the batteries. Lithium ion battery degradation has also been studied using TXRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit220"><sup><span class="sup_ref">220</span></sup></a> The technique was used for the direct determination of transition metals that were electro-deposited on the battery graphite anode. It was found that TXRF yielded results that were in reasonable agreement (recoveries in the range 91–100%) with those obtained using microwave assisted digestion procedures with ICP-MS and ICP-OES detection. It was reported that in battery operating conditions exhibiting low anode levels of transition metals, TXRF provided sufficient sensitivity for the measurement.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">In a new and potentially very significant development, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been used in a full field microscopy mode to map lithiation in transition metal oxide cathodes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit221"><sup><span class="sup_ref">221</span></sup></a> A new approach that reduced XAS measurement time was employed. Sample X-ray dose was reduced by using fewer spectrum energy points (12) at the absorption edge for measurement. Although this reduced overall spectral resolution, the approach was coupled with post- measurement processing involving a comparison of the measured spectrum data with high resolution XANEs reference spectra (47 energy points) for the same area of the electrode. The method was used successfully to monitor changes in oxidation state of battery electrode metals (Al, Co, Ni). In a similar vein, a new spinel based electrode material for lithium ion batteries has been characterised by fast μ-XRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit222"><sup><span class="sup_ref">222</span></sup></a> The electrode (of the type LiNi<small><sub>0.5</sub></small>Mn<small><sub>1.5</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>) was mapped using medium spatial resolution (500 nm) over a millimetre range.

            <p class="otherpara">The disposal of electronic equipment at the end of the lifecycle is now widely recognised to generate adverse environmental impacts. However, approaches to recycling of devices are also driven by financial considerations due to the economic value of component raw materials and energy saving potential. The European Directive (RoSH 2011/65/EU) specifies that plastics containing brominated flame retardants are identified and removed from the recycling process. A combination of these factors has led to literature reports describing analytical methods to evaluate the potential for environmental impact. For example, a batch leaching test has been described and applied to the assessment of the toxicity associated with electronic motherboards.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit320"><sup><span class="sup_ref">320</span></sup></a> The devices were subjected to leaching procedures using distilled water, nitric acid, acetic acid and synthetic acid rain solution.

Significant differences between surface and bulk concentrations of both Au and Ag were observed and in combination with other elements in the LA depth profile were related to composition of the devices (such as electromagnetic shielding in mobile phones). The presence of Au and Ag was confirmed using SEM-EDS. However, it was claimed that the LIBS methodology provided significant advantages in term of minimal sample preparation and speed of analysis. The technique was considered, somewhat optimistically, to be potentially useful in recycling processes as it was able to reveal hidden surface and bulk component structural content that cannot be easily identified for analysis by visual inspection alone. The depth profiling of metal coatings on circuit boards has been investigated directly using a novel low temperature plasma probe sampler.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit225"><sup><span class="sup_ref">225</span></sup></a> The dielectric barrier discharge was used to sputter the sample layer by layer and the resultant aerosol generated was transported in the discharge gas flow to an ICP-Ms detection system. The combined instrument was used to profile a 20 μm Au layer on a 10 μm Ni/Cu substrate within a 30 s period. The results obtained were reported to be consistent with those obtained by XPS.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Finally, in an unusual development, elemental analysis has been used to characterise a semiconductor lubricant in a hard disk storage media device.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit226"><sup><span class="sup_ref">226</span></sup></a> The sample was studied unburnished, after acetone cleaning and under argon sputtered conditions prior to measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used in total reflection mode to detect C, F, O and N in the upper layer of the disk. The detection of Co and Pt was only achievable in the XPS non-total reflection mode because they were constituents of a deeper layer below the surface and interfacial regions of the device.</p>

          <span>There have been fewer publications relating to the characterisation of glasses in the year under review, perhaps reflecting the maturity of the field. A summary of relevant analytical methods reported is provided in the accompanying table.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">There is increasing interest in the application of atomic spectrometric techniques that can provide insights into the micro-structure of glasses. For example, GD-TOF-MS has been applied in the depth profiling of coated glasses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit227"><sup><span class="sup_ref">227</span></sup></a> A pulsed r.f. source was used to sample glasses and associated thin conductive and non-conductive layers. It was established that by selection of an appropriate GD pulse interval, it was possible to discriminate by temporal measurement of the pulse profile against polyatomic spectral interferences affecting key analyte masses of interest (Ca,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> K,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> Si (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28">ref. 28</a>) and Ti (<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48">ref. 48</a>)). The instrument was able to measure a full mass spectrum every 33 μs, allowing for the possibility of detecting possible contaminants in the thin coatings (such as Cd, Sn, Te and Sb). A multi-matrix calibration procedure was adopted utilising both conductive and non-conductive samples. The elemental composition and thickness of the layered materials determined using this method was reported to be in agreement with nominal values. The characterisation of the thickness of nanometric thin films of vanadium oxide deposited on glass has been investigated using a portable XRF instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit228"><sup><span class="sup_ref">228</span></sup></a> The instrument employed a mini-X-ray tube source with a silver target which could be operated up to 40 kV and 100 μA. An XR-100CR Si-PIN detector fitted with a preamplifier and a thermoelectric cooling system was employed for measurements. In order to maximise signal to background ratio in the presence of the silica glass matrix substrate, a 100 μm Ag filter was employed to strongly attenuate Ag K line source excitation. It was found that analytical conditions of 28 kV maximum voltage and 15 μA maximum current were optimal for the measurement of analyte elements with K<small><sub>α</sub></small> and K<small><sub>β</sub></small> energies in the 3–15 keV range. The sample was placed 2 cm from the tube and 2.5 cm from the detector. It was fond that the thickness of the V nanometric films could be linearly correlated with the attenuation of the Ca K<small><sub>α</sub></small> line intensity derived from the underlying glass substrate.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Depth profiling of a simulated nuclear waste glass has been explored using an argon clustering source in ToF-SIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> The use of argon cluster ions for sputtering has become increasingly popular in recent years because has been observed in other applications to it produce less sample damage than when using conventional Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ion sources. All three ion sources were compared directly for the characterisation of a leached simulated borosilicate nuclear waste glass (SON68) using the same IONTOF TOF-SIMS instrument. It was found that using optimal Ar<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> source conditions of 20 keV, a high sputter rate and low charge accumulation was achieved that allowed an interlaced model of dual beam depth profiling (time-separated sputtering and analytical phases) to be achieved without compromising analytical performance. However, in contrast to other reports in the literature, surface roughness was reported to be about a factor of two worse for the Ar<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> source than for 2.0 keV Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ion sources in the same application. Nevertheless, the principal advantage of the approach was considered to be that the time taken to achieve depth profiling was shorter using the argon cluster ion system as a result of improved sputter rate.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Atomic spectrometric techniques are not best suited to the determination of fluorine, which is of particular relevance in relation to the analysis of glasses. Traditional methods involve lengthy sample digestion procedures that are prone to analyte losses and interference effects. Given these longstanding difficulties, two very different approaches to this application described in the period under review are worth highlighting. A new methodology for the analysis of F in glasses and glazes has been published.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit230"><sup><span class="sup_ref">230</span></sup></a> The approach described was based on the use of WD-XRF to achieve a rapid and reliable control method. Thus samples were prepared in the form of beads and subjected to direct analysis. Calibration was achieved using RMs that had previously been analysed for F by potentiometry. A quantification limit for F of 0.1% w/w was reported for the method. The second paper concerns the novel use of laser ablation for sampling into a glow discharge source for separate excitation prior to MS detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit231"><sup><span class="sup_ref">231</span></sup></a> The ablation sampling chamber was modified to introduce two electrodes to allow a discharge to be recreated in reduced pressure argon and helium atmospheres. The analytical performance of the system was compared to that for a conventional LIBS system for the analysis of RMs, glass and fluorine pellets. The main advantages of the LA-GC-MS technique in comparison with LIBS were reported to provided low detection limits, reduced matrix effects and better linearity, particularly in respect of F analysis.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The determination of trace metals in zircon glasses by LIBS is problematic because of spectral interferences derived from the matrix element. A new approach to overcoming this problem has been described which involves the combination of LIBS with fluorescence spectroscopy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit232"><sup><span class="sup_ref">232</span></sup></a> A Nd:YAG laser operated at 1064 nm was employed to volatilise the glass sample. The resultant plasma-induced fluorescence from trace level Sm and U present could be distinguished from the LIBS background signal thereby allowing improved quantification. Detection limits were reported of 6 ppm and 154 ppm, for Sm and U respectively. A comparison of the performance of this new technique with WD-XRF in this application might be interesting to conduct.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Once of the cited disadvantages of the use of atomic spectrometric techniques involving laser sampling of solids is that of variable signal response resulting from elemental fractionation. This variability can arise from the use of different lasers and operating conditions, including the cell used and transfer of sample to the detector. The choice of laser is one of the critical decisions to be made in terms of instrumental set up and has been the subject of much investigation in recent years. Consequently, further work has been published in the comparison of femtosecond and picosecond lasers for use in the direct analysis of glasses by ICP-MS. Thus Shaheen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit233"><sup><span class="sup_ref">233</span></sup></a> have investigated elemental fractionation and instrument response for laser beams of different pulse widths. Synthetic glass (NIST SRM 610) naval brass samples (SRM 1107) were ablated at the same spot for 800–1000 pulses using the same 785 nm laser operated with pulse widths of 11 = 30 fs and 110 ps respectively. Pulse repetition rates of 5–50 Hz were used. It was reported that the intensity of ICP-MS signals was higher for the fs laser under the same laser pulse repetition rates and fluence used. This observation was attributed to differences in particle size distribution produced by the lasers, and to consequent effects arising from transport of the sample to the plasma and resultant efficiency of ionisation. The fs laser also produced larger sized craters in the sample resulting in higher signal intensity. Assessment of element ratios indicated greater elemental fractionation for the ps laser than for the fs laser and it was noted that pulse repetition rate was a contributing factor. The reproducibility of replicate measurements of signal intensity, element rations and element fractionation was reported to be better using the fs laser (3–6%) than for the ps laser (7–11%). The determination of the U isotope content of glass using a laser ablation multi-collector ICP-MS instrument has been described.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit234"><sup><span class="sup_ref">234</span></sup></a> Samples of NIST glass SRMs (610, 612, 614, 616) were ablated using a fs laser. The U content of these samples was a two component mixture of naturally occurring U and an isotopically depleted spike added when the material was prepared. It was noted that the LA-ICP-MS analysis suggested that spatial inhomogeneity for rare U isotopes existed in the NIST 616 glass SRM. The fact that the analytical results agreed well with those derived from a sample dissolution and separation method indicates that this finding is unlikely to result from any intrinsic instrumental bias.</p>

          <span>The analysis of nanomaterials has continued to be one of the most heavily researched areas in this review. This is because of the large number of applications with which they are associated. As well as this section, the readers are also directed to other sections of this review, (cosmetics, 2.2.4, catalysts 2.3.2 and polymers 3.6) where other nanomaterial papers with a slightly different or wider application focus may appear. This section of the review focuses on applications grouped around the two principal analytical methods employed: (a) asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (AF4) and (b) single particle (SP) analysis; both of which are coupled with ICP-MS. There have been other papers that have adopted different approaches, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> capillary electrophoresis, direct introduction of the nanomaterial through nebulizer/spray chamber assemblies, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Progress in each of these areas will be discussed below.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">There was one review paper published covering detection, characterization and quantification of engineered nanoparticles (containing 217 references)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit258"><sup><span class="sup_ref">258</span></sup></a>. The review discussed the state of the art analytical methods used for determining chemical composition, mass and number concentration, size, shape aggregation <span class="italic">etc.</span> Such methods included AF4, SP analysis, capillary electrophoresis and hydrodynamic chromatography; all usually coupled with ICP-MS. Also discussed were coulometry and chemical sensors selective to nanoparticles. Sample preparation methodologies were also considered.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The combination of asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation coupled with ICP-MS (also referred to as AF4 below) has been discussed in a number of publications. Many report applications in which assorted types of nanoparticle were characterized successfully in many different matrices. However, it was also reported that potential errors may occur under certain circumstances.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a> Losses of Ag nanoparticles were observed during analysis using AF4-ICP-MS. Parameters that might influence such losses including focusing and cross flows as well as sample concentration, buffer composition and the membrane itself were all studied. After use, the membrane was subjected to LA-ICP-MS analysis and this indicated that Ag losses to it accounted for less than 0.6% of the total Ag, which was regarded as being negligible. This effect could be minimized using sufficiently low concentrations and optimal conditions. Analysis of the cross-flow, slot-outlet flow and purge flow also indicated that less than 0.5% of Ag was lost to each of these parameters. The recovery rate at the detector flow was nearly 90%, indicating loss somewhere in the system. Injection of an ionic Ag standard resulted in the very low recovery rate of 6%. The authors concluded that loss of Ag during the analysis of Ag nanoparticles was therefore mainly attributable to the dissolution into Ag ions. In another paper, Ag nanoparticles as well as ions were determined in spiked river waters and some consumer products.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260</span></sup></a> The protein corona that forms on the nanoparticles on exposure to bovine serum albumin was used as a nanoparticle stabilization and recovery enhancement mechanism. Speciation between nanoparticulates and ions was achieved with the addition of penicillamine as a complexing agent. The effects of nanoparticulate coating and ionization state on the quantification were also evaluated. When a 5 mL sample loop was used, a LOD of 4 ng kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained for the method.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The analysis of food grade SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> particles was considered in three separate papers. A generic sample preparation scheme for inorganic nanoparticles in a complex matrix for detection, characterization and quantification using AF4 coupled with multi-angle light scattering and ICP-MS was proposed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit261"><sup><span class="sup_ref">261</span></sup></a> The objective was to separate the nanoparticles from the matrix without altering the particle size distribution and without loss of the analyte. Two sample preparation protocols were tested: an acid digestion and a colloidal extraction. The former gave &gt;90% recovery of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles from a tomato soup matrix whilst not changing the particle size distribution. The SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> analyte is clearly very acid resistant. There are many nanoparticles for which the method developed would not be suitable. The determination of food grade SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles (food additive E551) using a range of analytical techniques including dynamic light scattering (DLS), multi-angle light scattering (MALS), AF4, ICP-MS and TEM was described in a second paper.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit262"><sup><span class="sup_ref">262</span></sup></a> The pros and cons of each method were discussed in detail. Experimentally, the AF4 coupled with ICP-MS approach enabled reliable detection below 100 nm for 10 of the 11 samples analysed. It was also able to quantify the mass concentration in seven samples at the mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level. The third paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> concerned the use of both MALS and ICP-MS as detectors for the AF4 separation. The AF4-ICP-MS used size calibrants, whereas this was not required for MALS. The calibration for particle size was achieved through the addition of silica nanoparticles of known size, whereas post channel addition of elemental standards enabled quantification of the silica present in the different size fractions. The AF4-MALS-ICP-MS system enabled dimensional and mass determination of silica nanoparticles over the range 20–200 nm. The method was applied to the reference material ERM-FD100 and a silica suspension.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several papers have reported the determination of Ag nanoparticles in numerous different sample types. Chicken meat was the sample of choice for Loeschner <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used an enzymatic extraction protocol to separate the analyte from the sample matrix.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> The results of AF4-ICP-MS were both repeatable and reproducible in terms of mass fraction and size. Although the work was successful, the authors did point out that determining the size distribution was difficult because of the lack of certified size standards. Another example determined citrate-stabilized Ag nanoparticles in anti-microbial consumer products.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> The success of AF4-ICP-MS in quantifying on a number-based particle size distribution was assessed though TEM, centrifugation liquid sedimentation (CLS) and DLS. The different techniques had varying degrees of success, with DLS failing. The authors attributed this to sample polydispersivity. Despite the samples having unknown surface properties and not knowing which dispersing agents to use (which could adversely affect AF4), agreement between AF4-ICP-MS and TEM data were in reasonably good agreement. The determination of citrate-coated and polyvinylpyyrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag nanoparticles in water extracts from soils was examined in a third paper.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> On-line UV-Vis and off-line HR-ICP-MS was used for detection following AF4 separation. The dispersant (0.01% sodium dodecylsulfate at pH 8) was added to facilitate successful fractionation. Using that dispersant, it was possible to determine the primary size of the nanoparticles in all but one case. The exception was for PVP-coated particles when clay colloids were present. This is because the nanoparticles interacted with the clay colloids, leading to an over-estimation of their primary size. Such an interaction is clearly possible in the natural environment, leading the authors to state that the nanoparticles could then enter aquifers and surface waters. A further study assessed the behaviour of Ag nanoparticles in artificial seawater.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> Analytical techniques including AF4-ICP-MS, SP-ICP-MS and UV-Vis were used to study the agglomeration process. The presence of alginate or humic substances affected the kinetics of the agglomeration process significantly. A final paper also determined Ag nanoparticles along with Au and Pt nanoparticles in controlled experiments in which Daphnia magna were exposed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit268"><sup><span class="sup_ref">268</span></sup></a> Care was again taken to ensure no change to particle size distribution or composition occurred during the extraction process. Accordingly, two procedures were developed. One involved tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TMAH) being used to digest the samples and the other was a much gentler enzymolysis procedure involving trypsin. The digests from both procedures were used for the AF4-ICP-MS study. Similar results were obtained for medium sized (50 nm) particles, but the use of TMAH was shown to lead to some dissolution of very small (&lt;5 nm) particles. The authors noted that only 1–5% of Au and Pt nanoparticles remained in solution after exposure. They concluded that significant uptake by, or adsorption to, <span class="italic">D. magna</span> must have occurred.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Size distribution of Au nanoparticles in dietary supplements has been studied using AF4 with UV-Vis and ICP-MS detection.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> A linear relationship between particle size and retention time was established and the procedure used to characterize unknown samples. The traditional method of TEM was employed for comparative purposes and it was found that there was less than a 5% difference between the data produced by the two methods over the particle size range 7–30 nm.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Nanoparticles are known to agglomerate in many sample types and this agglomeration can make their determination difficult. If a simple ‘total’ concentration measurement is to be made, the agglomerated nanoparticles can sink to the bottom of the sample tube and not be taken up into the nebulizer of an ICP or FAAS instrument. Even if the agglomerates are taken up by the nebulizer, they may be discriminated against by the nebulizer/spray chamber sample introduction assembly and never reach the plasma. Gross underestimates may therefore be made of real concentrations. The agglomerates can also lead to serious problems when particle size distribution measurements are to be made. Dudkiewicz <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit270"><sup><span class="sup_ref">270</span></sup></a> developed a uniform measurement expression for cross method comparison of nanoparticle aggregate size distributions. Effectively, numerous techniques (high vacuum SEM, liquid cell SEM, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), AF4-ICP-MS, gas phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) and CLS) were all used to obtain size distributions of the same silica sample. The size distributions from each were then compared and conclusions drawn on individual method's measurement accuracy, LOD and LOQ. Both GEMMA and AF4-ICP-MS gave comparable data. The other four techniques suffered from problems associated with high LOD (CLS, NTA and liquid cell-SEM) or sample preparation that is biased by increased retention of smaller nanoparticles (SEM). However, the development of a uniform expression of mass equivalent diameter (MED) enabled the other techniques' data to still be used and be related to each other.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Determining the speciation between Ag ions and Ag nanoparticles has long been problematic. This issue has been addressed by the employment of hollow fibre AF4 coupled with several different detectors including UV-Vis, DLS and ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> This new method, named HF5 by the authors, comprised a hollow fibre and a mini-column packed with Amberlyte IR120 resin to preconcentrate the Ag ions and Ag complexes. The mini-column was placed after the AF4 arrangement and before the ICP-MS instrument. Such an arrangement enabled full separation of Ag ions, the adduct of Ag with cysteine, and five sets of Ag nanoparticles (with nominal diameters of 1.4, 10, 20, 40 and 60 nm). Good agreement between data obtained using this system and those from TEM were obtained. In addition, recovery for the seven Ag species tested ranged from 70.7–108%. Although this outcome is a still little variable, it is clearly a significant step forward for in research in this area.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Single particle analysis (SP) has been one of the most rapid growing areas of research relevant to this review over the last few years. Its expansion has continued this year, but with a subtle change of emphasis. Previously, there had been many theoretical studies attempting to elucidate optimal operating conditions. In this review period, while many theoretical studies have been produced, these are still outnumbered by descriptions of technique applications.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The results of an interlaboratory comparison in which the gold nanoparticle reference materials NIST RM 8012 and NIST RM 8013 were sent to six expert laboratories were reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272</span></sup></a> The level of agreement in particle size measured by SP-ICP-MS and six reference techniques was good. However, the precision of the measurements between laboratories was relatively poor. Precision between different workers within the same laboratory was better. Precision was better for the material with the larger, 60 nm particles. Particle number concentration and Au mass concentration recovery were quantitative for RM 8013, but were significantly lower and with much poorer precision for RM 8012. Analysis of the operating conditions did not indicate an optimal dwell time.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Data acquisition for SP-ICP-MS can be problematic, but data evaluation can be equally troublesome. The development of a data evaluation tool as a routine technique for the calculation of particle size concentration and size distribution from the raw data of SP-ICP-MS was reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273</span></sup></a> The tool was evaluated using data from both a quadrupole and sector field instruments and using four types of nanoparticle. The size LOD for the quadrupole instrument were: 20 nm (Ag and Au), 50 nm (TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and 200 nm (SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>). The sector field instrument gave marginally improved LOD, for instance 10 nm for Au. Concentration-based LOD ranged from 1 ng L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for a 60 nm Au nanoparticle up to 0.1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for a 500 nm silica nanoparticle. The dynamic range was limited to only two orders of magnitude, presumably to ensure coincidental particle detection, so sample dilution was frequently necessary. Precision was &lt;5% and &lt;10% relative for the determination of particle size and concentration, respectively. Accuracy was described as being &lt;10%. The whole technique was then applied to food, wastewater, culture media and biological tissues. The authors concluded that SP-ICP-MS with their evaluation tool was rapid, cost efficient and an easy to use screening technique for metal and metal oxide nanoparticles.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Single particle-ICP-MS is still not fully developed and the problems of incomplete particle vaporization and the non-linear detector response as being the major factors that cause non-linearity at high particle mass have been studied.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit274"><sup><span class="sup_ref">274</span></sup></a> The non-linear detector response in the pulse count mode arises from the overlapping of ions at the detector within the 40 ns dead time of the electron multiplier. The overlap was particularly severe if a short pulse duration of 300 μs is used. The non-linear detector response was modelled using Poisson statistics. In addition, the applicability of different external calibration methods was examined including the use of standard particles, discrete standard droplets and continuous nebulization of a standard solution. The continuous nebulization of standard solution may yield a different sensitivity to particulates and also requires a linear response. Calibration using the other two methodologies did not suffer these drawbacks.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">According to one report,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit275"><sup><span class="sup_ref">275</span></sup></a> another problem identified when SP-ICP-MS is used is that it is particularly poor at measuring extremely low diameter particles (&lt;10 nm). The size detection limit was improved in the study by resolving the ion bursts from Ag or Au nanoparticles using a 0.1 ms dwell time. The method employed, termed ‘the Fast Acquisition Speed Technique (FAST)’ was evaluated using a sector field instrument with high ion transmission efficiency. An algorithm was also developed to aid data processing. Using FAST and the algorithm, the particle size LOD was improved to 6.4 nm. Strenge and Engelhard<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276</span></sup></a> also identified some limitations of SP-ICP-MS and, in an attempt to overcome them, developed a data acquisition unit capable of probing the ICP-MS instrument's detection circuitry. The unit was capable of achieving dwell times of as little as 5μs and could operate over an unlimited measurement time. Using a much higher time resolution than a typical particle related ion cloud, it was possible to minimize the possibility of particle coincidence and eliminate split particle events completely. A duty cycle of 100% of the counting electronics increased the method's accuracy further. Detection limits with regard to particle size were still approximately 10 nm. The relative merits of μs rather than ms dwell times were also discussed at length.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Numerous applications of SP-ICP-MS have also been published. For example, SP-ICP-MS has been employed to monitor TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Ag and Au nanoparticles during drinking water treatment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit277"><sup><span class="sup_ref">277</span></sup></a> Measurements of concentration, size, size distribution and dissolved metal element concentration in the waters were made. The effects of conventional drinking water treatments, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> lime addition, alum coagulation, filtration and disinfection, were all tested. Of the nanoparticles tested, 97 ± 3% were removed by the addition of lime and alum coagulation followed by a filtration through an activated carbon filter. Waters (source and drinking) were also collected from some treatment plants. Although the Ag and Au particles were not present in the source water, TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was. The treatments used at each of the plants were capable of removal of 93% of the Ti containing particles and the dissolved Ti. Other examples of SP-ICP-MS were the determination of Ag nanoparticles from the decoration of pastry<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit278"><sup><span class="sup_ref">278</span></sup></a> and Cu nanoparticles in soil.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit279"><sup><span class="sup_ref">279</span></sup></a> In the former application, TEM was used as a means of method validation. The number-based size and shape distribution of the nanoparticles released from silver pearls added to the pastry were determined. The material NM-300 K was used as a positive control to determine the uncertainty on the measurement of the shape and size of the particles.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The determination of ZnO nanoparticles in surface and waste waters has also been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit280"><sup><span class="sup_ref">280</span></sup></a> To distinguish between nanoparticulate Zn and dissolved Zn<small><sup>2+</sup></small>, the authors used a mini-column of Chelex-100 to retain the ions prior to determination. In addition to obtaining a size distribution of nanoparticles, it was also possible to distinguish between labile Zn ions and the strongly bound Zn fractions. Spiked and unspiked water samples were used for the analysis. In two natural waters analysed, 93–100% of the dissolved Zn was measured. The nanoparticles present in the wastewater samples comprised small agglomerates with a size ranging from 133.6 to 216.4 nm. The last application relevant to this section is one that described the analysis of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticulates in sunscreens.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit281"><sup><span class="sup_ref">281</span></sup></a> The primary particle size, size distribution, particle concentration (particles per mL) and mass content (weight percent) of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> were measured in four commercial sunscreens. Primary particle sizes ranged from 32 to 40 nm. The mass content was determined using a novel standard addition SP-ICP-MS approach in which 40 nm titania nanoparticles were added as the standard. The authors noted that results obtained were in reasonable agreement with those obtained after acid digestion. However, there was room for improvement and this was ascribed to the nanoparticle standards used for calibration not being closely matched in size to those found in the samples.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There have been reports of the use of single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in conjunction with microdroplet generation (MDG)-ICP-MS. In one example of this approach, individual microdroplets provided by the microdroplet generator were merged with an aerosol generated by a pneumatic nebulizer and then introduced to the ICP-MS instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit282"><sup><span class="sup_ref">282</span></sup></a> The MDG provided high efficiency transport of individual and discrete droplets, which can be used as a means of calibration for SP-ICP-MS. The main advantages of the system were described as being the fast processing of large sample volumes, fast exchanges of different sample matrices and the calibration of the nanoparticle signal using traceable elemental standards. Bulk analysis of the nanoparticle solution allowed transport efficiency determination without the requirement of any additional information from reference nanoparticles. Standard Ag nanoparticles were analysed and had diameters of 60.41 nm and 80.0 ± 1.4 nm which are in good agreement with values obtained from the supplier (60.4 ± 6.6 nm and 79.7 ± 5.4 nm). In a second approach standard SP-ICP-MS was compared with MDG-ICP-MS for the determination of particle number concentration of Ag and Au particulate suspensions in either ultrapure water or citrate solution.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit283"><sup><span class="sup_ref">283</span></sup></a> Transport efficiencies for the nebulized sample were calculated using the waste collection method and were 11–14% for Ag and 9–11% for Au. Transport efficiency for the MDG was 100%. The SP-ICP-MS yielded results that were 20–40% of expected values whereas the MDG results were closer to 80%. The authors noted the importance of nanoparticle reference materials if the accurate determination of particle number is required.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Interestingly, despite the fact that SP-ICP-MS is not yet fully developed, it has already been used as a reference method for new techniques. A new method for the characterization of silica nanoparticles was based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) binary yes/no measurement arrangement, binomial statistics and DNA comprising the silica nanoparticles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit284"><sup><span class="sup_ref">284</span></sup></a> Individual tagged particles over the size range 60–250 nm could be detected and counted in drinking water using a standard PCR device within 1.5 hours. The SP-ICP-MS was used as validation which might be a step too far at the current stage of development given the foregoing discussion in this section of the ASU. Nevertheless, in the absence of alternative reference approaches, this development does at least indicate that SP-ICP-MS is becoming established as a valuable technique in this field. At present the alternative method they have developed appears not to be able to measure smaller nanoparticles or other nanoparticles types, (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ag, Au, CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, <span class="italic">etc.</span>). However, it is clearly another step forward. The use of SP-ICP-MS as a reference technique has been described in the context of the development of SALD (substrate assisted laser desorption) of sample directly from a suitable absorbing plastic surface using a commercial ablation cell.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit285"><sup><span class="sup_ref">285</span></sup></a> A frequency quintupled Nd:YAG laser (213 nm) operating at a low laser fluence was used to ablate Au nanoparticles individually to an ICP-MS instrument. Operating conditions such as laser fluence, laser beam scan rate and carrier gas flow rate were all optimized to ensure the greatest analyte transport efficiency to the plasma and to avoid Au nanoparticle disintegration within the laser irradiation. A well-characterized reference material containing Au nanoparticles of diameter 56 nm was analysed; obtaining a transport efficiency of only 61%. The technique was also tested on a commercially available sample of Au nanoparticles of diameter 86 nm.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As set out in the foregoing, although flow field-flow fractionation- (AF4) and single particle-ICP-MS were the most common atomic spectrometric methods for nanoparticle characterization, other methodologies have also been used. As discussed previously, the determination of nanoparticles in water samples can be problematic because of agglomeration. This leads to significant underestimation of nanoparticle concentration.

The chemical dispersants tested included Triton X-100, ammonium polymethacrylate and polyethyleneimine. The efficiency of the dispersion was measured using the zeta potential and through the determination of Ti using ICP-MS after acid digestion of the samples. Having optimized their protocol using stabilized samples in a pure water matrix, river and wastewater samples were spiked with nanoparticles and the optimal method was used in characterising these matrices. Zeta potential measurements indicated a very different dispersal and this was attributed to different ionic strength and the presence of organic (humic) substances. Unfortunately, these findings will not have come as a surprise to many workers in the field.</p>

The ETV device was attached to the ICP-OES instrument and the temperature program started. The analyte was transported to the plasma in a stream of argon and hydrogen. Calibration was carried out using external aqueous standards analysed the same way. Since the analyte was separated from the sample matrix, few interferences were observed. In addition, because the sample was added as a dry powder, the plasma operated under dry conditions, enabling the discharge energy to be focused on exciting the analyte. Consequently, the LOD for Cl was very low (170 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) when 60 mg of sample was used. The precision reported for the measurement (<span class="italic">n</span> = 16) for 100 ng of Cl was 8.7% relative.

          <span>In this review period, activities relating to the analysis of polymers and composites have fallen into two categories: (a); the leaching of metals from food packaging materials and (b) the development of new analytical techniques. As always, there is a necessity to ensure that valid analytical data are being obtained and so there have also been a few studies concerning the development or re-testing of CRMs and reports on the results of inter-laboratory comparisons.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have reported the preparation or analysis of a CRM. The effects of long term X-ray irradiation on Cr and Hg in a polypropylene disk (NMIJ CRM 8136-a) were reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297</span></sup></a> Measurements using an EDXRF instrument over 430 h revealed that the Cr/Pb decreased whereas the Hg/Pb stayed constant. This implied that there was a loss of the Cr, with time. The Cr had been added as an organic compound during preparation of the CRM and it was thought that the phenomenon may be related with this. Measurements over 120 h using a WDXRF instrument demonstrated a similar trend. The second paper discussed the preparation of candidate reference materials for the determination of P-containing flame retardants in styrene-based polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit298"><sup><span class="sup_ref">298</span></sup></a> Since P-containing flame retardants are now preferred to the brominated versions, validation materials are required for their determination. Accordingly, materials containing resorcinol-bis-(diphenylphosphate), bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate), triphenyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphine oxide were prepared. The polymer materials prepared containing the retardants were: polycarbonate and acrylonitrile-<span class="italic">co</span>-butadiene-<span class="italic">co</span>-styrene, and blends of polystyrene with polyphenylene oxide. As well as the usual homogeneity and thermal stability tests, the materials were also analysed using ICP-OES, NMR and FTIR to determine the concentration of the flame retardants.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The results of inter-laboratory comparisons for analytes in food contact polymers have been published in two papers.

This was regarded as being acceptable for the testing specifications. The results from some labs using ICP-MS were higher for Sb than the amount that had been added. The authors stated that this was because the Sb became adsorbed to glassware in the standards at lower concentration and that, therefore, strict control of the concentrations used was necessary. Despite this, the ICP-MS values for the trueness, repeatability and reproducibility were 99–106%, 0.7–2.2% and 2.2–10.5%. In a very similar study, extract solutions from food contact rubber products were tested for their Zn content.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300</span></sup></a> Again, 18 laboratories used the same range of detection techniques to determine the Zn in water and in 4% acetic acid solution.

          <p class="otherpara">New methods for the determination of elements in polymers have appeared in the literature in the year under review.

However, there are few reports of the use of this well established technique appearing in the literature. In this context it is a little surprising, given the practical problems involved in accurately weighing out mg levels of sample, that solid sampling GFAAS was one of the most common techniques reported in the last year for direct analysis of plastics.

Calibration was achieved using external standards and standard additions, where aqueous standards were added directly to the sample boats. The absolute LODs obtained using the method ranged from 0.1 ng (for Cd) to 9 ng (for Fe) when using a 5 mg sample mass.

          <p class="otherpara">Chlorinated and brominated flame retardants have been used in polymer foams for many years and their presence in these building materials must be identified in order for them to be re-cycled. The standard method employs gas chromatography with either mass spectrometry or flame ionization detection. These approaches are time-consuming because of the extensive sample preparation required. Consequently, methods for rapid and direct atomic spectrometric measurement have been proposed based on PIXE<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit311"><sup><span class="sup_ref">311</span></sup></a> and portable XRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> In the first application, PIXE was used to determine the halogens in 215 polyurethane foam samples. Data obtained using PIXE were compared with those from GC-MS for some of the samples, with excellent agreement obtained in these cases. The method could be completed in a fraction of the time and at much lower cost than the traditional method. In the second application, the brominated flame retardant hexabromocyclododecane (which has recently been added to the persistent organic pollutant list) or an alternative polymeric brominated flame retardant were determined by XRF in expanded and extruded polystyrene foam.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> Since the hexabromocyclododecane has now been banned but the polymeric material has not (yet), a rapid screening method is required to distinguish between the two. The portable XRF instrument was used to analyse 27 samples and was able to correctly identify all those that contained the banned substance. Relative precision for quantitative measurements was better than 14% and results obtained were in good agreement with those obtained using GC-FID.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A particularly novel application was described by Kumar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit313"><sup><span class="sup_ref">313</span></sup></a> in which laser-induced breakdown spectrometry was used to measure the salt build-up on off-shore wind turbine blades remotely. A method for monitoring of the accretion of salt on blades is required to inform actions needed to minimize the risk of lightning strikes. A photometric device comprising a translational stage and an optical fibre was designed that enabled measurements to be made from between 1 and 100 m away. At the time of publication, the method was capable of identifying and quantifying the deposits up to a distance of 40 m. The instrumental setup was described in detail, with helpful schematic diagrams given. The salt content was determined by measurement of Na, using the conventional emission wavelength of 589 nm. Obviously Cl, the other elemental constituent of salt, could not be detected using this LIBS approach because of its relatively high first ionization energy.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">In one of the few reports not involving solid sampling approaches, Kolasa <span class="italic">et al.</span> described a method for the determination of trace heavy elements (Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb) in polyethylene packaging materials following microwave assisted digestion of the samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit314"><sup><span class="sup_ref">314</span></sup></a> This paper is worth highlighting because of the novel approach used in the development of the sample pre-treatment procedure. Samples were first analysed using SEM-EDS to give a total concentration of each analyte. The microwave digestion program was iteratively modified until similar analytical results were obtained using FAAS and a Hg-specific instrument. The authors stated that once developed, the method was quick and simple, but it a little surprising that the sensitivity of the method proposed is sufficient for the detection of the normally encountered levels of these elements in polyethylene.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The effects of flame treatment on the surface characteristics of four injection moulded, automotive grade polypropylene samples were investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit315"><sup><span class="sup_ref">315</span></sup></a> Changes to the O surface concentration were determined using XPS and was found to increase as a function of flame treatment. The extent of this O concentration increase was dependent on the type of polypropylene, with the glass-filled sample exhibiting less of an increase than a carbon pigmented and talc filled sample. Depth profiling indicated that modification of the surface to a depth of 7 nm occurred for one pass of flame treatment, but this increased to 15 nm when seven passes were made. The XPS analysis also indicated that initial attack of the polymer occurred at the pendant methyl group.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Finally, the potential of LIBS for the detection of tire tread particles was studied by Prochazka <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit316"><sup><span class="sup_ref">316</span></sup></a> One of the applications of real time and <span class="italic">in situ</span> detection of tire tread particles is the identification of optically imperceptible braking tracks at locations of road accidents. Thus LIBS was employed to identify Zn (added as zinc oxide) added into tire treads as an agent simplifying process of vulcanization. Measurement parameters including incident laser energy, gate width and gate delay were optimised. The accuracy of the approach was assessed by using ICP-MS and ICP-OES as reference techniques for the determination of Zn. The ultimate aim of the research was to develop a device for automated identification of braking tracks.</p>
