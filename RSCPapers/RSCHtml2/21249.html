These fascinating MCN materials can be obtained through the polymerization of different aromatic and/or aliphatic carbons and high nitrogen containing molecular precursors <span class="italic">via</span> hard and/or soft templating approaches. One of the unique characteristics of these materials is that they exhibit both semiconducting and basic properties, which make them excellent platforms for the photoelectrochemical conversion and sensing of molecules such as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and the selective sensing of toxic organic acids. The semiconducting features of these materials are finely controlled by varying the nitrogen content or local electronic structure of the MCNs. The incorporation of different functionalities including metal nanoparticles or organic molecules is further achieved in various ways to develop new electronic, semiconducting, catalytic, and energy harvesting materials. Dual functionalities including acidic and basic groups are also introduced in the wall structure of MCNs through simple UV-light irradiation, which offers enzyme-like properties in a single MCN system. In this review article, we summarize and highlight the existing literature covering every aspect of MCNs including their templating synthesis, modification and functionalization, and potential applications of these MCN materials with an overview of the key and relevant results. A special emphasis is given on the catalytic applications of MCNs including hydrogenation, oxidation, photocatalysis, and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00532b/c6cs00532b-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c6cs00532b-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2017/CS/c6cs00532b/c6cs00532b-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

      <h2 id="sect372"><span class="a_heading">1. Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>Carbon nitrides (CNs) are fascinating materials with unique properties including semiconductivity, basicity, high hardness, chemical robustness, and high chemical and mechanical stability. The incorporation of nitrogen in the carbon matrix of CNs not only offers a unique electronic structure with a band gap less than 2.7 eV but also helps to enhance their field emission, photo and basic catalytic, carbon capture, and energy storage properties. The properties of the CN materials are mainly controlled by the structure, composition and crystallinity of the CN framework. As well documented in the literatures, typical CN materials with five different structures have been predicted so far: one is two dimensional graphitic carbon nitrides C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> (g-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and four are three-dimensional CNs, namely α-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>, β-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>, cubic-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>, and pseudocubic-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–6</span></sup></a> Among these CNs, g-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>, a stable layered material made of a CN framework with a structure similar to a graphitic nanostructure, has attracted a lot of attention because of the mild conditions required for the synthesis, its stability and highly versatile physical and chemical properties, and its wide range of application possibilities in various fields including catalysis, hydrogen storage, capture and storage of carbon dioxide, water decontamination, solar energy conversion, and even sensing of toxic molecules. This triggered the researchers to put considerable efforts into the investigation of g-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>, which has resulted in in-depth fundamental knowledge acquisition and a series of reports covering topics from the history of CNs to their synthesis, structure and multipurpose applications.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">There are several methods available for the synthesis of CNs including pyrolysis or polymerization of nitrogen containing molecules including melamine, urea, thiourea, cyanamide (CA), <span class="italic">etc.</span> Recently, exfoliation routes have also been successfully developed for the preparation of a single nanosheet of g-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> materials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7–9</span></sup></a> However, CN materials with a perfect C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> stoichiometry have not been achieved because of the incomplete de-amination or polymerization of the nitrogen precursor. The experimental conditions, nature of the nitrogen–carbon precursors and the degree of polymerization of the nitrogen precursors mainly dictate the crystallinity and the nitrogen content of the CN materials, which have a direct relation with the final properties of these materials. Although five structures of CNs with a C/N stoichiometric ratio of 0.75 have been theoretically predicted, it has been very difficult to prepare such materials without any defect sites or hydrogen contents under mild reaction conditions. This brings about huge debate on the naming of CN materials as the C/N ratio varies from 4.3 to 3 depending on the nature of the precursors and the reaction temperatures used in the synthesis. The definition of CN materials has changed significantly from the ideal C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> stoichiometry and now the same has been extended to include compounds such as C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N, C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>2</sub></small>, C<small><sub>10</sub></small>N<small><sub>3</sub></small>, C<small><sub>5</sub></small>N, C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>5</sub></small>, C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>6</sub></small>, C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>7</sub></small><span class="italic">etc.</span>, having lower or higher nitrogen content than the ideal C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> configuration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> The higher and lower nitrogen content with respect to the ideal C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> is attributed to the presence of structural defects which are affected by the reaction conditions, degree of condensation and relative reactivities of the precursors and nitrogen rich or low cyclic rings in the CN framework. In this review, the CN materials with a C/N ratio higher than 0.75 are called nitrogen low CN materials, whereas the materials with a C/N ratio lower than 0.75 are presented as nitrogen rich CN materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Although CN materials exhibit unique electronic and mechanical properties, the non-porous nature together with a relatively low surface area of those CN materials prepared either from molecular or chemical precursors at high temperatures limits the exploitation of these materials for extended applications. Applications of these fascinating materials mainly in the fields of catalysis and adsorption where surface area and pore volume play an important role in controlling their performance are quite limited because of the unusually low surface area (&lt;10 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and specific pore volume due to their nonporous structure. The problems of low surface area and specific pore volume can be overcome by the introduction of porosity in the CN matrix through templating strategies while retaining the carbon and nitrogen chemistry and the basic building blocks of the bulk g-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>. The field of CNs has experienced a revolution in the last decade because of the increasing interest in developing porosity in the CN materials as the presence of the porous structure results in higher specific surface areas expanding the scope of application of these materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The first report of mesoporous carbon nitrides (MCNs) by Vinu <span class="italic">et al.</span> in 2005,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> led to a new class of MCNs, with large specific surface areas and different pore diameters between 2 and 50 nm, which has been considered for a large spectrum of potential applications in the fields of electro, basic and photocatalysis, energy conversion, gas storage, adsorption, and selective sensing and separation owing to their unique electronic, optical, basic, and mechanical properties.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11–45</span></sup></a> The synthesis of MCNs mainly involves the templating approaches, in which hard or soft sacrificial templates have been utilized to create ordered porosity and a high surface area in the MCN nanostructures.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46–47</span></sup></a> Over the last decade, intensive research has been carried out to exploit the myriad of inherent structural and textural properties such as ordered structure, extremely high surface areas, narrow pore size distribution, tuneable pore size, uniform particle size, controllable shape and morphology, and also the crystallinity and semiconducting features of the MCNs, and the surface engineering and functionalities including organic and inorganic nanostructures inside the mesochannels of the MCNs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">MCNs prepared through a nanohard templating approach using mesoporous silicas as hard-templates can have specific surface areas of up to 1125 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, a higher pore volume of up to 1.8 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and tuneable pore diameters along with a large number of basic active sites.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11,12,29</span></sup></a> Furthermore, the MCN materials also exhibit tuneable band gaps, a high basicity along with high chemical and thermal stabilities, and surface functionalities in addition to the high surface area, large pore volume, uniform pore diameter, and controlled morphology, which are critical for obtaining higher performances in various applications including catalysis, sensing and adsorption.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Controlling the valence and conduction band edge of MCNs by simply tuning the quantity of nitrogen in the MCN framework is one of the exciting and challenging research areas that has received a lot of attention in recent years.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22,23</span></sup></a> Nitrogen content of the MCNs can also be controlled by using precursors with different aromatic or aliphatic molecules with different nitrogen content.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11,12,22,23</span></sup></a> Recently, MCNs with a nitrogen content higher than the theoretically predicted stable g-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> have also been prepared, which have unique but quite different semiconducting properties than g-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> and are found to be attractive materials for photocatalysis.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22,23</span></sup></a> These materials are referred to as nitrogen rich MCNs, which opens a new platform that can be used for the manipulation of CN based materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In this review, we give an overview of the synthesis, structural and physicochemical properties, as well as the prospects for application of original and functionalized MCNs with different nitrogen contents, structures and pore diameters. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> and summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, the main focus of this review will be on the synthetic strategies for MCNs through templating approaches with various molecular precursors of carbon and nitrogen sources. The fundamental mechanism and principles for the preparation of MCNs are introduced together with a discussion of the respective advantages and disadvantages of synthetic routes, the resulting structural properties, and the key features of these materials. Modifications and functionalization of MCN materials with metals, inorganic metal complexes or organic molecules are also considered in the following section. The selected key examples of MCNs with different functional groups and post-functionalized ones, as well as a comprehensive overview of the state of research with their potential applications are discussed. This review article specifically covers metal free and photo-catalytic applications involving basic catalysis, hydrogenation, oxidation, and water splitting, as well as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake for clean energy and environment. It is expected that this review would help the readers to know and understand the pioneering work in the field of MCNs and the current developments spanning the various aspects of MCNs, which may open the door for large-scale applications.</p>

      <h2 id="sect840"><span class="a_heading">2. Syntheses of MCNs</span></h2>
      <span>The introduction of well-ordered porosity in the CN framework is quite challenging. A templating strategy is generally used for creating well-ordered porosity in the CN materials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11–13,47</span></sup></a> In this section, we will discuss the synthesis methods and templating strategies as applicable to MCNs, as reported in the literature to date. Two well-established techniques are employed for the synthesis of porous materials including siliceous as well as non-siliceous techniques. These are hard-templating (nanocasting or replication) and soft-templating (self-assembly) approaches. Both approaches are illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>. Soft templating involves the use of organic structure directing agents, which are self-assembled with C and N precursors to form an ordered structure. In this case, porosity is generated upon removing the surfactants through ethanol washing or a calcination process. On the other hand, the hard templating strategy uses highly ordered 2D or 3D porous solid materials to replicate their structure into CN nanostructures. Generally, mesoporous silica materials such as SBA-15, FDU-12, MCM-41, and MCM-48 are used as the hard templates while organic molecules and/or supramolecules, such as amphiphilic surfactants and block copolymers, are used as soft templates. In the following section, we will discuss the processes involved in these templating strategies.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect846"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Hard templating approach</span></h3>
        <span>The nanocasting technique using a hard template is the most widely reported and successfully applied method used for the introduction of mesoporosity in solid materials such as carbons, nitrides, polymers and ceramics.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48,49</span></sup></a> Casting as a process to make industrial goods and household items has been known to humans for several centuries. In the casting process, a rigid mold made of a suitable material such as wax, metal or plaster is filled with the material that is to be cast. After the necessary processing time, the mold is removed and a negative replica of the mold bearing all the features of the mold is obtained. Large concrete underground drainage pipes, plaster, toys, sculptures, and pots are typically made using this casting process. Nanocasting is conceptually identical to the casting process described above. However, the two differ in terms of the length scale involved. While casting is predominantly done on a macroscopic scale, nanocasting on the other hand is done on the nanoscale and hence the prefix “nano” is used while referring to the casting process as applied to the synthesis of materials with nanodimensions. The word “template” is widely accepted by the material science community as a substitute for the word mold when referring to casting in the nanoscale. Based on the physical state of the template, a template could be called a hard template if it is a solid or a soft template if it is a liquid. Nanocasting as a synthetic route for nanomaterials involves the following three key steps: (a) synthesis of the ordered mesophase silica template; (b) infiltration of the template with the necessary precursors, including the conversion of precursors into a solid; and (c) removal of the template.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a></span>

It should be noted that the pore size of MCN-1 is 4.0 nm, which is much lower than that of the mesoporous silica template SBA-15 (9.1 nm) but similar to the wall thickness, revealing the transformation of silica walls into pores and the pores of the templates into CN walls. This confirms the replication of the structure of the mesoporous template into the MCN nanostructures.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">The pore diameter, specific surface area, nitrogen content and specific pore volumes of the MCNs can also be tuned with a simple adjustment of the pore diameter of the template and the amount of infiltration of the C and N sources into the pores of the templates. Vinu <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the effect of pore tuning of the mesoporous silica template on the surface area, pore diameter and nitrogen content of MCNs. The pore diameter, surface area and nitrogen content of MCN-1 was tuned by synthesizing SBA-15 silica templates at three different temperatures, 100, 130 and 150 °C, and using these to synthesize MCN-1.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> The template materials prepared at different temperatures have different pore diameters, pore connectivity and surface textures which result in a huge difference in the specific surface area and pore volume of the MCN-1 samples. It was reported that the mesoporous silica template with the largest pore diameter can support the formation of MCN-1 with the largest pore diameter. This is mainly due to the incomplete filling of the C and N precursors in the mesoporous silica template with the largest pore diameter. It was also demonstrated that the nitrogen content of MCN-1 can be finely controlled by varying the amount of infiltration of the nitrogen precursor, EDA, as it controls the degree of polymerization of the C and N precursors. When a high amount of EDA was used, MCN-1 with the highest nitrogen content can be prepared. This is due to the fact that the large quantity of EDA can enhance the degree of polymerization between EDA and CTC, which limits the release of nitrogen from the completely polymerized CN matrix upon carbonization.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In 2007, Vinu <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported 3D cage type MCNs using SBA-16 as the silica template and CTC and EDA as the carbon and nitrogen sources; the material was called MCN-2 (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3A</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> In comparison to MCN-1, MCN-2 shows a much higher specific surface area of 810 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a relatively higher total pore volume of 0.81 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. It is evident that the 3D cage type structure of SBA-16 significantly contributed to the higher specific surface area and pore volume of MCN-2. Based on the chronology of the reports, MCN-2 has better textural properties than MCN-1. However, MCN-1 and MCN-2 exhibit relatively lower nitrogen content due to the low thermodynamic stability of nitrogen in the MCNs, as nitrogen prefers to stay as a nitrogen molecule rather than connecting with a carbon of the CN matrix. In addition, the large size of the particle also does not favour a higher incorporation of nitrogen in the CN matrix as it hinders the complete polymerization of C and N precursors due to the incomplete filling of the deep parts of the pores with the required precursors.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">As the nitrogen content in MCN-1 and MCN-2 was low, Vinu <span class="italic">et al.</span> adopted a new “nanoparticle” strategy for increasing the nitrogen content in MCNs by using ultra-small size mesoporous silica nanoparticles through a hard templating nanocasting technique using the EDA and CTC polymerization approach and the material was called MCN-3 (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3B</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> The template used for the synthesis of MCN-3 was prepared by using a mixture of Pluronic P123 and Fluorocarbon-4 (FC-4) surfactants. The nitrogen content of MCN-3 (C/N ratio = 2.3) is much higher than that of MCN-1 and MCN-2 (C/N = 4.5), which were prepared using an identical polymerization process as discussed earlier. It was surmised that the small nanoparticles of the template helped to retain a huge quantity of nitrogen in MCN-3 as it requires more energy to break the CN bond in the nanoparticles than in the large particles. However, the C/N ratio of MCN-3 is still lower than that of the theoretically predicted carbon nitride (C/N = 0.75).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Vinu <span class="italic">et al.</span> overcame the problem of lower nitrogen content in the MCNs by following a twofold strategy: (1) lowering the carbonization temperature and time; (2) using a single carbon nitrogen precursor as a polymerization species inside the pore channels of the mesoporous silica template.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22,23</span></sup></a> A single molecular precursor with a high nitrogen content namely amino guanidine was used to prepare MCN-4 using SBA-15 as the template (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>).

This high nitrogen content in the MCN-4 samples was mainly due to the combination of low reaction temperature (400 °C), and the high nitrogen containing precursor that easily undergoes polymerization and offers a highly thermally stable diamino-<span class="italic">s</span>-tetrazine moiety that is linked trigonally with the nitrogen atoms. The reduction of temperature from 600 °C to 400 °C and the change of CN precursors make a huge difference in the CN stoichiometry of the MCN samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a></p>

        <p class="otherpara">Vinu <span class="italic">et al.</span> also tried to make MCNs using 3-amino-1,2,4-triazine (ATN), which is an aromatic precursor, and KIT-6 as the mesoporous silica template at a reaction temperature of 400 °C. Unfortunately, ordered MCNs were not obtained. Therefore, the reaction temperature was increased from 400 °C to 500 °C and a highly ordered MCN-5 sample with a crystalline graphitic CN framework was obtained (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5A</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> Surprisingly, the C/N ratio of MCN-5 was 0.92, which is almost similar to that of the C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> (0.75) but much lower than that of MCN-1, MCN-2 and MCN-3. This can be explained by the fact that the use of a cyclic aromatic single precursor such as ATN would significantly reduce the amount of energy required to frame cyclic triazine units in the wall structure and at the same time, the presence of a large amount of nitrogen in the cyclic structure of the ATN molecule would boost the nitrogen content in the final product. The difference in the nitrogen content of MCN-4 and MCN-5 is mainly attributed to the difference in the reaction temperature and the C/N ratio of the initial precursors. These results reveal that the choice of the reaction temperature and the CN precursor is highly critical, which has the capability to tune the crystal structure and the nitrogen contents of the final products.</p>

However, there is a lack of evidence in their assumption as the reported materials were not characterized using the main tools such as XPS or EXAFS. Although the use of CA as a precursor in the preparation of MCNs ensures a high nitrogen content, it suffers from various drawbacks including high cost and an explosive nature besides being toxic. These factors strongly inhibit the use of CA on a large commercial scale for the synthesis of MCNs.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Xu and co-workers proposed a novel and environmentally benign precursor guanidine salt and colloidal silica nanoparticles as hard templates for the synthesis of disordered MCNs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> The resulting MCNs exhibited a disordered mesoporous structure with bimodal pores (1.8 and 13.4 nm), surface areas between 146 and 215 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and pore volumes in the range 0.57–0.84 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6C</a>).

In 2014, the same researchers also used hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as a single molecular precursor for the synthesis of MCNs using SBA-15 as the hard template <span class="italic">via</span> the nanocasting technique (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6D</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> The resulting MCN showed a very high surface area of 788 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a pore volume of 0.68 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

        <p class="otherpara">Zhao <span class="italic">et al.</span> also reported the synthesis of highly ordered MCNs with ultra-high surface areas using the same HMT as the C and N precursors and SBA-15 as the hard template in the nanocasting process (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6E</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> The materials were denoted as DUT-1-<span class="italic">T</span>, where <span class="italic">T</span> denotes the polymerization pyrolysis temperature 600, 750 and 900 °C whereas DUT denotes the Dalian University of Technology. DUT-1 showed an exceptionally high surface area in the range of 971–1124 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, a super large pore volume in the range of 1.31–1.79 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and high nitrogen content in the range of 9.2–23% besides bimodal pore size distribution. It was reported that the pyrolysis temperature played a key role in controlling the surface area and pore volume of the DUT-1 samples. The nitrogen content was significantly reduced from 23 wt% to 9.3 wt% as the carbonization temperature was increased from 600 to 900 °C. Among the three samples, DUT-1-900, which was prepared at 900 °C, exhibited the highest surface area and pore volume. However, the specific surface area of the samples reported by Xu and his co-workers was quite different although both the research teams used the same HMT as the C and N precursors and SBA-15 as the hard template. This was attributed to the perfect crosslinking of the C and N precursors and the huge release of nitrogen, leaving a lot of microporosity in the CN walls, at a high temperature. It is also surmised that the difference in the pyrolysis temperature and the ratio of SBA-15 and HMT makes a huge difference to the final properties of the MCN. Although the CN source used in this synthesis of MCNs was different from that used for MCN-1,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> both the materials prepared at 600 °C showed almost similar textural and crystal structure properties.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Park and Zhao <span class="italic">et al.</span> modified the nanocasting technique slightly by using a controlled pore filling technique and the incipient wetness method (IWM) without using any additional solvent.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> Liquid CA was used as the single molecular precursor and 2D-hexagonal SBA-15 and 3D-cubic mesoporous silica were used as the hard templates. The advantage of the IWM is that only a calculated amount of the precursors is needed to efficiently and effectively fill the meso-channels of the template and there is no accumulation of the precursor outside the meso-channels, thereby avoiding the formation of unwanted amorphous particles. The C/N ratio of the MCN was found to be 0.88 after carbonization at 550 °C for 3 h. The specific surface area for the MCN from SBA-15 and 3D cubic mesoporous silica is 361 and 343 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively, which is much lower than that reported by Vinu <span class="italic">et al.</span> The pore volumes are 0.5 and 0.67 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively. The pore diameter was 2.78 nm for MCNs prepared from SBA-15 and 2.45 and 8.03 nm for MCNs prepared from 3D-cubic mesoporous silica. Unfortunately, the XRD and nitrogen adsorption data of these samples revealed that the samples prepared using the IWM exhibited a disordered mesoporous structure which is due to the fact that the IWM is not an effective method for the perfect filling of the mesopores, which is critical to obtain well-ordered mesopores.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Lee <span class="italic">et al.</span> claimed that MCNs can be prepared using a single molecular precursor, urea through nanocasting using colloidal silica nanoparticles with a size of 7 mm (commercially available Ludox SM-30) as the hard template.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a> The samples were annealed for 4 h at 550 °C to obtain yellow coloured MCNs, which were found to be photoactive.

The absence of low angle XRD and CHN analysis data in the report resulted in a failure to make any conclusions on the mesostructural order and the composition of the sample.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Researchers have also tried to prepare MCNs without the aid of mesoporous silica templates and its nanocomposites with inorganic metal oxides such as silica. Normal silica precursors can be used to create the mesoporosity through a simple interpenetration in the condensed form of the CN precursors. Kailasam and co-workers reported the synthesis of a MCN–silica composite following a combination of sol–gel and thermal condensation approaches using silica and CN precursors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> Interestingly, the procedure involved a simple mixing of CA and the silica precursor tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and the subsequent evaporation of the solvent at 80 °C following polymerization of the mixture at 550 °C for 4 h to give a silica–carbon nitride composite. The silica–carbon nitride composite could be treated with aqueous NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>HF<small><sub>2</sub></small> to give a pure disordered MCN and the same composite, if heated to 650 °C for 5 h, could yield pure silica. The interpenetration of the silica within the CN framework generates disordered mesoporosity after heat or silica removal treatment. The composite materials as well as the pure carbon nitride showed disordered mesopores and the specific surface area varied between 77 and 270 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> depending on the ratios (3, 6, or 12) of TEOS with CA. However, no porosity was observed when a large amount of the silica source was added in the synthesis mixture.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">MCNs with different electronic properties can also be prepared by using a CN precursor containing sulphur. Cui and Antonietti co-workers realized this amazing opportunity for introducing sulphur into the framework of MCNs. A single molecular precursor containing sulphur, ammonium thiocyanate, was used for the synthesis of an ordered mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (ompg-CN) and a mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-CN) using SBA-15 and nano-sized silica (commercially available as 12 nm, Ludox HS40) respectively as the hard template <span class="italic">via</span> the nanocasting technique.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a> Interestingly, the C/N ratio of ompg-CN was found to vary between 0.74 and 0.77, with the average being very close to the ideally predicted 0.75 for the perfect C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> structure. However, the surface area exhibited by these materials was not so impressive lying in the range of 129 to 239 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and with a pore volume varying between 0.24 and 0.82 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. It is believed that the elemental sulphur can escape as H<small><sub>2</sub></small>S and provide accelerated and improved condensation of the intermediates such as dimelamine to form the CN materials through a simple deamination route.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Recently, Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported a very simple sol–gel based synthesis of MCNs using single molecular amino cyanide as the C/N precursor and colloidal silica as the hard template.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> It was found that the silica removal process with NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>HF<small><sub>2</sub></small> is an important step as it can control the morphology and the mesostructure of the final product. The treatment of the MCN–silica nanocomposite with NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>HF<small><sub>2</sub></small> at different time intervals can convert the MCN into low dimensional nanostructured CN materials, which is attributed to the anisotropy self-decomposition through a possible acidic hydrolysis of the CN frameworks. A longer NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>HF<small><sub>2</sub></small> treatment time favors the formation of hierarchical mesostructures and pores of more than 150 nm can be obtained. It should be noted that the BET surface of MCNs prepared using this route was not that high (185.5 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), but had pore diameters in the range of 10 to 150 nm.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Although different hard templates including silica precursors, mesoporous silica templates, colloidal silicas, and silica nanoparticles were utilized for the synthesis of MCNs using various C and N precursors, this hard templating approach requires the toxic and expensive template removal process that involves hazardous HF or ammonium bifluorides. It is not only considered to be a time consuming and hazardous process, but also a non-environmentally friendly process, which may be a hurdle for the translation of these researches into commercialization of real world products. Therefore, it is imperative to find eco and environmentally friendly approaches to prepare MCNs.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect1046"><span class="b_heading">2.2 Soft-templating approach</span></h3>
        <span>A soft-templating strategy has been widely applied for the synthesis of various mesoporous materials including inorganic metal oxides and mesoporous carbons. This soft templating strategy was simultaneously realized by Dai <span class="italic">et al.</span> and Ikkala <span class="italic">et al.</span>, and Zhao <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the first synthesis of porous carbon structures and films <span class="italic">via</span> the self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69–71</span></sup></a> Unlike the widely reported hard template based nanocasting procedures for the synthesis of MCNs, reports on the use of soft templates for the synthesis of MCNs are quite limited. The main reasons for the little success reported using soft templating based synthesis of MCN materials in particular are attributed to the thermodynamics of the synthesis process and the condensation of the C and N precursors in the presence of surfactants, as well as physiochemical factors such as decomposition of the soft template during pyrolysis. This may either contaminate the final products with more carbons or collapse the mesostructure due to the strong interaction between the soft templates and the CN polymerized frameworks. These drawbacks can be overcome by using an extraction procedure involving sulphuric acid as an alternate route to remove the soft template.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">The soft templating strategy was realized by Antonietti <span class="italic">et al.</span> for the preparation of MCNs <span class="italic">via</span> simple self-assembly between the organic structure directing agents and the CA (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7A</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> A host of ionic and non-ionic surfactants and amphiphilic block polymers such as P123, P127, Triton X-100, Brij30, Brij58, and Brij76 were used as structure directing agents for the preparation of the MCNs. A stepwise calcination program was applied in order to avoid the collapse of the mesoporous structure of the MCNs during the surfactant removal process. It should be noted that when the traditional soft-templating method was used, the yield of the MCN product was almost zero. This low yield is due to the side reactions between the CN polymerized framework and the surfactants, which makes the whole self-assembled unit highly volatile. It was quite interesting to note that only the Triton X-100 based soft template offered mesostructured CNs without any micropores, and the BET surface area and the pore diameter were reported to be 76 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 3.8 nm, respectively. No micropores were present in the sample but some large pores up to 15 nm were observed. The porous CN prepared using the P123 surfactant yielded only micropores and the BET surface area was found to vary from as low as 8 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to 299 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> depending on the template to precursor ratio. This was quite surprising as P123 generally offers a well-ordered mesostructure. It was assumed that the robust self-assembly of the surfactant was not formed when it was added together with the CN precursors and the chemical reaction between the surfactant and the CN polymerized frameworks is also responsible for the collapse of the structure during template removal. It has been observed that the carbon content of the final product is much higher when P123 was used as the soft-template. This confirms the reaction between the surfactant and the CN precursors. Interestingly, the conducting properties of these materials are much higher than that of the samples prepared using the nano hard-templating approach.</p>

Interestingly, unlike the material prepared from Triton X-100, microspores were completely absent. The surface area could be varied by changing the template to precursor ratio.

This may be attributed to the poor volatility of the ILs, which limits the strong reaction between the CN network and the ILs. When an IL with a DiCA counterion was used as the soft-template, the carbon content of the final product was significantly increased due to the polymerization of the anions present in the IL.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Recently, Yan reported MCNs with a worm-like porous structure using Pluronic P123 as the soft template and melamine as the single molecular precursor.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> The BET surface area was found to be 30 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and it increased to 90 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> after calcination at 500 °C. It was reported that the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms are type IV, which are typically observed for the mesoporous materials but the capillary condensation step in the isotherm was not steep, revealing the absence of well-ordered mesoporosity in the sample. It may be worth noting here that Antonietti <span class="italic">et al.</span> did not find any mesoporosity in the materials synthesized using P123 as the soft template and DiCA as the precursors, and the BET surface area was attributed to the presence of micropores only.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> Interestingly, elemental analysis showed that the C/N ratio of this sample was 0.65, which is lower than the theoretical C/N ratio of ideal C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> (0.75). It should also be noted that the carbon content in the MCNs prepared by Yan (C/N = 0.65) is much lower than that of the MCNs prepared by Antonietti <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> The main reason for the difference in the carbon content of the samples prepared by these two groups may be due to the nature of the precursors used in the synthesis. This means that the volatility of the self-assembled unit may be controlled by using different CN precursors.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Shen <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the soft template synthesis of MCNs with bimodal pore size distribution using Triton X-100 as the soft template and melamine and glutaraldehyde as the double molecular precursors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> These materials show type IV isotherms, indicating the presence of mesoporosity in the material. However, the BET surface area for the two samples carbonized at 600 and 800 °C are reported as 172 and 221 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which are much higher than those of the MCNs reported by Zhang and Antonietti <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> who also used Triton X-100 as the soft template and DiCA as the precursor. The higher surface area was attributed to the decomposition of Triton X-100 during the carbonization process. The mesopore sizes were found to be 3.8 nm and 10–40 nm, which originated from the removal of the polymeric surfactant and the intraparticle space between the plate-like particles of the MCN, respectively. The FT-IR spectra revealed that the nitrogen atom is present as C–N and N–H chemical groups suggesting a polar nature of the material. The absence of the low angle peak of the samples suggested that the samples possess disordered mesopores. This observation was also consistent with the nitrogen adsorption isotherm of these samples, which did not show any steep capillary condensation step.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The above results reveal that the soft-templating strategy, even though it is an eco and environmentally friendly approach, mostly offers disordered MCNs with a low specific surface area and specific pore volume. In addition, the samples mostly have either small pores that originate from the surfactants, or ultralarge pores originating from the intraparticle space of the aggregated particles, which can be altered with a simple adjustment of the pyrolysis temperature.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect1102"><span class="b_heading">2.3 Template-free approach</span></h3>
        <span>Generally, soft or hard templates are required to introduce the ordered porosity in CN materials. However, this templating process involves tedious synthesis procedures, long synthesis time and high cost, which put a major hurdle in the way of commercialization. Recently, many efforts have been made to introduce mesoporosity in CNs using a template free approach. The template-free approach as the name implies does not involve any kind of hard or soft template for the synthesis of the MCNs. The process essentially relies on the experimental conditions, especially on the type of energy used in the reactions including thermal, sonochemical and low energy acoustic waves, which dictate the extent of mesoporosity (more precisely nanoporosity) in the MCN materials. This approach has been gaining reasonable momentum recently as it has the potential to reduce the cost of the synthesis of MCNs to a low level by eliminating the expensive templates and the hazardous template removal process which normally forms a key step in the hard and soft templating approaches discussed in the earlier sections. However, the template free approach is not quite as successful as the hard templating or soft-templating approach due to the poor textural properties of the final MCN products, but is undergoing continuous development. In this section, we briefly touch upon the essence of the template free approach with some relevant examples.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Lu <span class="italic">et al.</span> employed the template free approach for the synthesis of MCNs by directly heating urea at ambient pressure to 600 °C at 10 °C min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and holding the temperature at 600 °C for 4 h.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> The resulting powder sample was simply washed with water and anhydrous ethanol followed by filtration and drying at room temperature. The wide angle XRD pattern exhibited a sharp peak suggesting a well pronounced graphitic character but the N<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption–desorption isotherm revealed disordered mesopores in the sample with no sharp capillary condensation step. The BET specific surface area was found to be 51.6 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which is much lower than that of MCNs prepared using hard or soft templates. Mesoporosity can be introduced on the non-porous CN materials with the simple treatment of sonication. Kumar <span class="italic">et al.</span> realized this approached and obtained MCNs with a surface area higher than 112 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and a large pore volume of 0.39 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> Although these results are impressive, the absence of a low angle XRD pattern raises some concerns about the ordered nature of the material. These results imply that it is still a challenge to prepare highly ordered MCNs with excellent specific surface areas and uniform pore diameters without any templates.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect1119"><span class="a_heading">3. Modification and functionalization of MCNs</span></h2>
      <span>The surface functionalization of various mesoporous materials including mesoporous silica, mesoporous carbons or mesoporous organic/inorganic hybrid materials has expanded their applications in many fields through simple modification with organic molecules, inorganic metal or metal oxide nanoparticles, and bio-molecules.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15,18,35,75–87</span></sup></a> These modifications allow fine tuning of the bulk and interfacial properties of the parent materials <span class="italic">via</span> a simple interaction with the guest molecules. As MCNs are fascinating materials with electronic, basic, and photo electrochemical properties, the surface functionalization of these materials could elevate the possibilities of their application in various fields. It is expected that the techniques or approaches used for the functionalization of the existing mesoporous materials including silica or carbons can be utilized to modify the properties of MCNs. However, the mechanical, thermal and chemical stabilities of the CN framework structure of MCNs are quite different from mesoporous carbons or silica, which could pose new challenges in the functionalization and characterization of functionalized MCNs. This is clearly reflected in the minimum number of reports on the functionalization of MCNs. A few techniques including impregnation, adsorption–desorption, and photo-assisted reduction processes have been employed to functionalize MCNs with metal or metal halide nanoparticles inside the mesochannels. In this section, we will review methods for functionalizing MCNs with different metals, dyes and organic molecules.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect1125"><span class="b_heading">3.1 MCNs doped with metals</span></h3>
        <span>The electronic and catalytic properties of MCNs can be altered by the incorporation of metals including transition or noble metals inside the mesochannels or by doping within the CN framework walls. In recent years, a few research groups have reported the incorporation of metal nanoparticles into the nanochannels of MCNs and investigated their performance as potential electro, photo and redox catalysts for energy storage and conversion and catalytic transformations. A selected set of noble metals, namely Pt, Pd, Au and Ag, has been encapsulated in the mesochannels of MCNs. Although the catalytic performance of these metal loaded MCNs has been discussed in the catalytic section that is described in the later part of this review, we briefly discuss the various reports involving metal-doped MCNs in this section.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In 2010, Datta <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the incorporation of gold nanoparticles with different sizes on the mesochannels of MCN-1 with different pore diameters.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> The pore diameter of MCN-1 was varied to tune the size of the gold nanoparticles inside the mesopores of the MCN. It was demonstrated that the multifunctionality of MCN-1, which acts as a stabilizing, reducing and size controlling agent, can be effectively used for the encapsulation of highly dispersed and size tuneable ultra-fine gold nanoparticles. The presence of functional groups on the surface of MCN-1 not only helps the formation of gold nanoparticles through an <span class="italic">in situ</span> reduction process but also offers a high dispersion of these nanoparticles along the porous channels. Better performance in a three component coupling reaction involving benzaldehyde, piperidine, and phenylacetylene was also observed for the gold functionalized MCN-1 sample. These interesting results led to the suggestion that this simple strategy could be applied for the fabrication of various noble metal nanoparticles inside MCN-1, which could result in promising catalytic materials for various organic transformations (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8A</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a></p>

        <h3 id="sect1201"><span class="b_heading">3.4 MCN functionalized with inorganic semiconductors</span></h3>
        <span>The role of a co-catalyst is of paramount importance in a photocatalytic reaction as it has the ability not only to tune the conduction and valance band edges of the catalytic system but also to assist the charge separation and the lifetime of the photogenerated species. The co-catalyst also has the capability to lower the activation barrier for the evolution of hydrogen or oxygen from photocatalytic water splitting. Although MCNs have all the hallmarks of an excellent, metal free photocatalyst for visible light water splitting reactions, the photocatalytic performance of MCNs, including selectivity, activity, and stability, is significantly dependent on the nature and type of the surface co-catalyst as it can easily fine tune the conduction and valance band edges of the MCN and support reductive or oxidative catalysis. The synergy between MCNs and the co-catalysts in a photocatalytic reaction finally dictates the overall performance. As a result, mostly expensive noble metals such as gold, silver and platinum have been utilized as co-catalysts which however limit the scalability of water splitting and energy harvesting reactions for industrial scale applications due to their high cost and scarcity. Therefore, researchers tried to functionalize MCNs with semiconducting nanostructures inside the mesoporous channels in order to tune its band structure. In this section, we discuss some of the recent reports where MCNs have been functionalized with inorganic semiconductors in order to replace the expensive noble metal based co-catalysts.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Hou and Wang co-workers recently reported an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of MCNs functionalized with a layer of MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> which serves as a co-catalyst.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> The functionalization was performed by impregnating MCNs with a solution of (NH<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>MoS<small><sub>4</sub></small>, followed by sulfidation with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>S at 350 °C. Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of the MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>/MCN hybrid material was comparable to that of the Pt loaded MCN. The high activity was related to the minimal lattice mismatch of the MCN and MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> which facilitated the uniform growth of the co-catalyst on the surface of the MCN. This unique structure offered a higher accessible surface area which significantly improved light utilization and enhanced the electron transfer across the interface through the electron tunnelling effect. More importantly, the unique structure of the MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> supported MCN makes room for the directional migration of electrons from the MCN to MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which then react with protons to generate a high amount of hydrogen. The group also studied the photocatalytic activity of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> evolution by loading MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> on a silica support. Surprisingly, there was no H<small><sub>2</sub></small> evolution. Likewise, MCNs alone did not show any significant H<small><sub>2</sub></small> evolution. These results highlight that the synergy between MCNs and MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> is absolutely critical for an appreciable H<small><sub>2</sub></small> evolution reaction.</p>

The functionalized MCN showed almost a twofold increase in efficiency when a very small quantity of WO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 1 wt%) was added to the MCN support material. The superior performance was attributed to the high surface area and the synergy between MCN and WO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, which results in improved charge separation, thereby increasing the lifetime of the electron–hole pair generated during the reaction. The electrons in the conduction band of the MCNs are available for the reduction of the protons to produce hydrogen whereas the holes in the valance band of WO<small><sub>3</sub></small> are effectively utilized for the oxidation of sacrificial agents.

These results reveal the importance of co-catalysts for the selective production of hydrogen through the photocatalytic process assisted by MCNs.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect1233"><span class="a_heading">4. Applications of MCNs</span></h2>
      <span>MCNs are interesting materials with unique basic, semiconducting, intercalating and adsorption properties, and have excellent chemical and mechanical stability, which makes them attractive for a range of applications including sensing, catalysis, energy storage and adsorption. It is also expected that these fascinating materials can also offer highly ordered porous structures, high specific surface areas, large pore volumes and a uniform pore size distribution. Unique properties can also be introduced into MCNs by modifying their porous structure or walls, which also has significant effects on improving their performance in various applications. In this section, we will highlight the application of MCN materials as reactive hard templates for the generation of new nanostructures, photo, basic, hydrogenation and oxidation catalysts, adsorbents and sensors.</span>

        <span>Recent reports have indicated the use of MCNs as templates for the synthesis of metal nitrides and carbides where MCNs play the role of hard reactive templates and also the nitrogen source for the metal nitrides.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32–34,90–92</span></sup></a> The term “reactive template” suggests that MCNs act both as a nanoreactor and as a source of nitrogen/carbon for the synthesis of metal nitrides/carbides.</span>

It is important to note that thermal treatment of the carbon nitride/precursor composite is a dangerous step and must be done carefully as it involves the release of hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen gases.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">It is interesting to note that the final morphology of the metal nitride obtained is a copy of the silica template used to prepare the MCNs. This means that the morphology of the metal nitride prepared using a hard reactive template could be easily varied by varying the morphology of the template used for the synthesis of the MCNs. The aforementioned method achieves two goals with ease: (a) the use of a high decomposition temperature automatically removes the template material; (b) the template MCN material serves as a nitrogen source, converting the infiltrated metal precursor into its corresponding metal nitride. The same group extended the above method for the synthesis of ternary metal nitride such as Al–Ga–nitride and Ti–V–nitride following a similar procedure to above (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11B</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> Metal sources such as GaCl<small><sub>3</sub></small>, AlCl<small><sub>3</sub></small>, TiCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> and VOCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> were used as suitable metal precursors for the synthesis of ternary metal nitrides.

          <span>The inherent basic functionality of MCNs due to the presence of free –NH<small><sub>2</sub></small> groups on the surface of the CN walls has been put to good use particularly as a “metal free basic catalyst” with impressive results paving the way for the development of large scale environmentally benign and cost effective industrially relevant processes. A host of well-known and industrially relevant reactions such as Friedel Craft alkylation and acylation, cyclisation of nitriles and alkynes, coupling reactions, Knoevenagel condensation, esterification and trans-esterification have been catalysed using MCN materials as the catalyst with promising results.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10,12,14,18,22,24,26–29,37–39,76,93–96</span></sup></a></span>

In a standard AlCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> catalysed Friedel crafts reaction involving a benzene ring and an electrophile, the reaction involves activation of the electrophile; however, Goettamann and co-workers were able to show that the activation of benzene in the alkylation and acylation reactions can be done with MCNs without the addition of the electrophile.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26,38</span></sup></a> It was also demonstrated that MCNs showed an excellent catalytic performance for the production of benzonitrile <span class="italic">via</span> the reaction between benzene and urea.

These results reveal that MCNs can be used as an excellent Lewis basic catalyst for the Friedel Craft aromatic substitution reactions for the synthesis of various value added organic products. However, the detailed mechanism or evidence was not provided to confirm the unique role of MCN in activating the benzene and urea molecules and further studies are needed to understand the exact mechanism of the reaction over MCNs.</p>

          <span>By modifying the surface of the MCN with different noble metal nanoparticles, new catalytic functionalities can be introduced. A handful of reports exist in the literature demonstrating the role of a noble metal nanoparticle supported MCN as a hydrogenation catalyst. Recently, Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the hydrogenation of aqueous bromate using Pd supported MCNs prepared from EDA and CTC as N and C precursors, respectively, and SBA-15 as the silica template <span class="italic">via</span> the nanocasting technique.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> Pd/MCN showed a much higher catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of bromate when compared with Pd/activated carbon and Pd/CMK-3 (ordered mesoporous carbon). The role of MCN as a support is probably to enhance the dispersion of Pd particles in the nanochannels of MCNs as the presence of a large number of free –NH<small><sub>2</sub></small>, –NH groups helps to anchor the Pd particles thereby enhancing metal particle dispersion besides providing a large surface area for higher adsorption of bromate ions. It is interesting to note that although Pd/MCN and Pd/CMK-3 have a comparable surface area, pore structure and Pd particle sizes, still there is a significant difference in terms of activity of the two materials for the hydrogenation of bromate. The reason for this difference in the activity is attributed to the nature of the charges on the surfaces of Pd/CMK-3 and Pd/MCN. Zeta potential studies revealed that the isoelectric points of Pd/CMK-3 and Pd/MCN were 3.2 and 8, respectively; the higher zeta potential of Pd/MCN is due to the presence of nitrogen containing functional groups such as pyridine, –NH and –NH<small><sub>2</sub></small> groups. The overall high catalytic activity exhibited by Pd/MCN is attributed to the Pd particle size inasmuch as the properties of the support MCN material.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The chemo-selective catalytic hydrogenation of quinoline to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline using Pd supported MCNs with an ordered porous structure under extremely mild reaction conditions of 1 bar and a temperature of 30–50 °C using molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent was demonstrated by Gong <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77</span></sup></a> An ultrasonication method was used to obtain a high dispersion of the nanoparticles on the surface of the MCNs. Interestingly, previous reports for the same reaction employed vigorous conditions such as a high temperature of up to 200 °C and a pressure of between 2 and 4 MPa. In that respect, the results are remarkable. It is worth mentioning that the N<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption isotherm did not change significantly after Pd was loaded on the support material MCN. However, Pd loading did result in a slight shrinkage of the BET area from 212 to 197 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, the pore volume from 0.48 to 0.32 cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the pore diameter from 7.42 to 5.68 nm.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Although the selectivity to the final product remained nearly unchanged, conversion however varied depending on the solvent. It is important to note here that the specific catalytic activity did not show a clear correlation with the dielectric constant, polarity or dipole moment of the solvent. Furthermore, the high catalytic activity of Pd@ompg-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> is attributed to the high nitrogen content in the support ompg-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> materials which anchor a large quantity of the Pd materials which in turn act as the active sites for hydrogen activation. In addition to the above factors, the cylindrical mesoporous structure of the support materials further facilitates the reaction by reducing mass transfer related limitation. From a commercial standpoint, the Pd@ompg-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> material showed a high recyclability without much loss of activity for the hydrogenation of quinoline. The activity of Pd@ompg-C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> was much higher than that of Pd supported activated carbon. The high activity was attributed to the synergetic interaction between the nanoparticles and the MCN support and the graphitic C–N–C layers and the mesoporous structure that facilitates mass transfer. The presence of incompletely condensed amino groups that help to anchor or reduce the Pd particles also supported the high activity.</p>

It is interesting to note that although DUT-1 and MCN-1 had nearly the same nitrogen content, still DUT-1 showed a superior catalytic activity than MCN-1 towards the dehydrogenation reaction which was attributed to the ultra-high surface area, super high pore volume and the microstructures including bulk structure and surface chemical properties. In addition, the surface nitrogen in DUT-1 that offered a high electron density and basicity not only promoted dehydrogenation but also suppressed the formation of cracking side-products such as benzene and toluene. These results revealed that the combination of excellent textural parameters together with the nitrogen functionalities on the surface of DUT-1 makes them excellent catalysts for the dehydrogenation of aromatics.</p>

Inorganic semiconducting metal oxides such as titania nanoparticles, metals, sulphides and phosphides have been widely used as photocatalysts for water splitting.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> However, these materials need to be modified to match up the valence band or conduction band edge of the catalyst for the splitting of water molecules under both UV and visible light. MCNs are metal free semiconducting photocatalysts which exhibit not only the appropriate band gap (2.7 eV) for water splitting but also crystalline semiconducting structures and surface functional groups. The highly ordered mesoporous structure and the high crystallinity of MCNs are expected to support the reactions of the photogenerated electrons and the holes that are in the conduction and valence bands of the MCNs, respectively, with the water molecules to produce hydrogen and oxygen but limit the recombination of the electron and holes. These excellent characteristics of MCN materials make them powerful photocatalysts for water splitting and other photocatalytic reactions.

However, the photocatalytic activity of non-porous carbon nitrides has been found to be low particularly because of the poor textural parameters. This has led the researchers to explore the possibility of using MCNs as they have higher light harvesting potentials due to high surface areas and multiple scattering effects.

In this section, we will present some of the recent reports that deal with MCNs for adsorption and separation applications.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The inherent basic nature of MCNs coupled with encouraging reports about the basic catalytic properties of MCNs have prompted the scientific community to exploit MCNs as potential adsorbents for the capture of an acidic molecule such as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. In recent years, the reports on CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption using porous silica materials, pure carbon and amine functionalized silica and carbon materials have been significantly increased owing to the awareness of the greenhouse effect and global warming that mainly results from the release of gases such as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and methane. However, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption on MCNs is a relatively untouched area with not many reports even though they exhibit a large number of basic sites with a high specific surface area and a large pore volume. Li <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capabilities of spherical MCNs prepared using mesoporous cellular silica foams (MCF) as hard templates <span class="italic">via</span> a nanocasting approach.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> It was demonstrated that the adsorption temperature has a telling effect on the quantity of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption as adsorption at 25 °C (2.9 mmol g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) is higher than at 75 °C (0.97 mmol g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption on MCNs progressively increased with increasing adsorption time and reached a saturation level after a certain time. In comparison to MCNs, the adsorption capacity of pristine carbon prepared using MCF as the hard template <span class="italic">via</span> the nanocasting process was much lower at 25 °C (2.5 mmol g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and 75 °C (0.3 mmol g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), which indicates the superior CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption properties of MCNs over pure carbon. It is generally believed that the surface area plays a critical role in deciding the overall adsorption capacity of a material; however, in this case, pristine carbon with a higher surface area of 737 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> showed a lower adsorption capacity compared to MCNs with a much lower surface area of 550 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The difference in the performance of these two materials could be attributed to the presence of a large number of basic sites due to the high nitrogen content and oxygen containing basic sites in the MCN material. Furthermore, in this case, MCNs have a large number of micropores in addition to the hierarchical mesostructure, mesopores and stable frameworks, which further enhanced its overall CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity.

The superiority of the composite material for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption was attributed to a large number of micropores donated by the extra carbon layer in the composite material. It was the cumulative effect of a large surface area, higher nitrogen content and higher micropore volume that dictated the overall CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity of the MCN/C composite materials. Both the MCNs and the MCN/C composite materials showed a strong adsorbate–adsorbent interaction manifested through the reasonable isosteric heat of adsorption in the range of 15.8–19.7 and 20.5–26.2 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively for the MCNs and the MCN/C composite.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">The development of porous solid materials that can accommodate large volumes of gas and also have the ability to dispense the same is being pursued with a lot of interest and scientific rigor.

It is evident that the adsorption temperature is a critical factor affecting the quantity of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorbed, as adsorption for both the samples is higher at 77 K than at 298 K. At higher pressures (under 50 bar), the 2D MCNs showed a higher adsorption than the 3D MCNs at 77 K and 298 K. This observation could be attributed to the higher surface area of the 2D MCNs (361 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) compared to that of the 3D MCNs (343 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), although there is not much difference in the surface areas. However, at lower pressures under 25 bar at 77 K and under 9 bar at 298 K, the 3D MCNs showed a slightly higher adsorption capacity than the 2D MCNs.

The adsorption process followed pseudo-second order kinetics and the maximum adsorption quantity was obtained by fitting the data to Langmuir's equation. The adsorption quantity increased progressively with time for all the three materials, however, MCN-1 showed a much higher adsorption of phenol as compared to the activated carbon and CMK-3-150 under the same adsorption conditions. MCN-1 exhibited the highest phenol adsorption capacity of 609 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and it is 2.37 and 1.29 times the adsorption capacity registered at 25 °C when using activated carbon and CMK-3-150, respectively.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, the endothermic nature of the adsorption process could be attributed to a stronger interaction between the pre-adsorbed water and the adsorbent as compared to the interaction between phenol and adsorbent MCN-1. The positive value of enthalpy Δ<span class="italic">H</span> in this case is also suggestive of the chemisorption of the acidic phenol molecule on MCN-1 with basic functional groups such as NH or NH<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The adsorption process was thermodynamically spontaneous and proceeded in the direction of increasing entropy as indicated by the negative Gibbs free energy Δ<span class="italic">G</span> and positive entropy change Δ<span class="italic">S</span> values. The effect of solution pH on the adsorption quantity was also studied. The amount of phenol adsorption over MCN-1 decreased significantly as the solution pH was increased. This was due to the fact that phenol was converted into phenolate at a higher pH, which poorly interacts with the highly basic surface of MCN-1 because of the strong electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. This finding also supported the fact that the basic sites of MCN-1 really influenced the adsorption of acidic organic molecules such as phenol. It should also be noted that the MCN-1 adsorbent was quite stable even after several adsorption experiments with the phenolic materials from waste water and the adsorption properties were not affected. As mentioned in the previous section, the adsorption properties can be significantly improved after increasing the number of basic groups <span class="italic">via</span> treatment with ammonia. It was found that the ammonia treated samples showed a much higher adsorption capacity for formaldehyde as compared to the CMK-3 and non-functionalized MCN-1 samples. This high adsorption capacity was attributed to the highest number of nitrogen functional groups on the surface of MCN-1 together with the micropores which were generated during the treatment with ammonia gas.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a></p>

The adsorption of PFOS and PFOA by the magnetic MCN was attributed to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Jia <span class="italic">et al.</span> recently reported the selective detection of acidic/basic molecules using highly ordered macro–mesoporous carbon nitride films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> The macro–mesoporous carbon nitride films showed a strong affinity for acetic acid in preference to aniline.

Therefore, these MCNs are called photo-switch sensors. This result is quite interesting as the photo-switch phenomenon can be applied for the selective sensing of both acidic and basic molecules with the help of MCN nanostructures after the appropriate modification.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span> also compared the Cr(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) adsorption capacity of MCN-1 with activated carbon and CMK-3.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> The adsorption capacity of MCN-1 increased with increasing reaction time and reached a constant value.

Interestingly, no change in the adsorption amount was observed for the activated carbon and the adsorption capacity was nearly constant with adsorption time. From the Langmuir isotherm, the maximum Cr(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) adsorption capacity for MCN-1 was found to be 48.31 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> whereas activated carbon and CMK-3 registered 35.34 and 35.09 mg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively.

The effect of temperature on the Cr(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>) adsorption capacity over MCN-1 was studied.

        <p class="otherpara">Recently, Mane and Vinu<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> co-workers reported the selective sensing capabilities of MCNs for the detection of acidic toxic molecules using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The group prepared MCNs with different pore diameters and textural properties and found that the sample with the largest pore diameter and well-pronounced mesoporosity showed the highest selective sensing performance especially for acidic formic acid molecules in a QCM experiment. The sensing performance of the MCNs was attributed to the acid–base interaction between the acidic molecule and the basic functional groups on the wall structure of the MCNs. However, the MCNs also registered a considerable amount of adsorption of pyridine, which is a basic molecule. It was demonstrated that the uneven distribution of electron density on the surface of pyridine results in a strong interaction between the highly polar pyridine and the amine groups on the surface of the MCNs, which contributed to the adsorption of pyridine molecules. These results reveal that the surface charge of the adsorbent and the adsorbate is important as it dictates the final adsorption capacity of the adsorbent.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect1647"><span class="a_heading">5. Conclusions and future outlook</span></h2>
      <span>The multifunctional characteristics of MCNs including semi-conductivity, basicity, intercalation and mechanical properties present them as preferred candidates for various applications including catalysis, sensing, adsorption and separation and energy. In this review, we have reviewed the current research trends in the area of MCN materials and considered different synthesis procedures, different C and N precursors, surface modifications and functionalization with organic and inorganic molecules and nanostructures, and the application of MCNs in catalysis (basic, oxidation–reduction and photo catalysis), adsorption, sensing and separation. From the unique structure, textural parameters, semiconducting and catalytic properties and various application possibilities, it was clear that MCNs have a tremendous potential and further high impact discoveries are yet to be made. It is hoped that this review article will serve as a good starting point for beginners in this field and seasoned researchers alike.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">In view of the plethora of research articles on new materials and technology for energy generation, storage and conversion, it stands to reason that a significant proportion of the scientific research and development activities is aimed at developing alternative, economical and sustainable energy resources before the world runs out of conventional fossil fuel based energy sources. Earlier in this article, we discussed the application of MCNs as a semiconductor based photo catalyst for H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production (water splitting). Although MCN materials offer excellent performances in the hydrogen evolution reaction through the photocatalytic pathway, they still need expensive co-catalysts and sacrificial agents which make the whole process quite expensive. The future challenge here is to design MCNs with a tunable band structure, with inbuilt functional moieties including organic or inorganic nanostructures in the mesochannels that should be able to split the water molecules without any co-catalysts and sacrificial agents. Photocatalytic water splitting without sacrificial agents has been realized by functionalizing either a hydrogen evolution co-catalyst or a water oxidation cocatalyst onto the surface of non-porous CN materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> It is highly anticipated that this methodology will be successful in designing new MCNs functionalized with inorganic nanostructures for water splitting in the future. As presented in this review, MCNs were found to be the best materials not only for splitting of water but also for the capturing of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. However, the future challenge would be to utilize both the in-built semiconducting and basic properties in the MCN system to convert the adsorbed CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into fuels and chemicals with water as an electron source through the photocatalytic pathway. As both H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are thermodynamically stable molecules, it calls for the careful design of semiconducting properties namely tuning of the band gap to achieve the visible light assisted splitting of water into protons and electrons which should be used for the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to fuels and chemicals. This approach is similar to photosynthesis where nature uses sunlight and water to reduce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into a number of organic products and every attempt is being made to mimic this naturally occurring photosynthesis process. However, at the moment, limited success has been achieved as far as the artificial photosynthesis process is concerned. Although MCNs present an alternate photoactive semiconducting material for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction, only a few reports are available in the literature discussing the possibility of using carbon nitride as a photocatalyst for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction using water and sunlight.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113,114</span></sup></a> These reports suggest that the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with water using MCNs is a scientifically challenging task and we need to do more research on the fundamental aspects of MCNs including the adsorption and diffusion of both water and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecules in the mesoporous system, band structure calculations and the role of defect sites. More research on the theoretical understanding of MCNs is also needed to fine tune the band edges, textural parameters and crystal structure of the MCN as this information is highly critical to activate both CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and water molecules.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Although MCNs have been effectively used as catalysts for various applications, they still suffer from a lot of defect sites and poor surface areas. Some catalyses require MCNs with defect sites but light assisted catalysis would need MCNs with a defect free CN framework. However, only little attention has been given to control the defect sites of MCNs and their role on the MCNs. More fundamental studies involving theoretical calculations are required to predict and understand the synthesis mechanisms and their role in controlling the defect sites in MCNs. The specific surface area of MCNs is a major concern. Only a hard templating approach offered MCNs with a high surface area but it is not a cost-effective process as it requires multiple steps involving sacrificial templates and high temperature calcination processes. It is also important to put more efforts on synthesising MCN using a template free approach through a soft templating approach which will pave the path for commercialization of these materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another challenge is to prepare carbon nitrides with different C and N stoichiometric ratios such as C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>5</sub></small>, C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>6</sub></small>, C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>7</sub></small> and C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>8</sub></small> and different dopants to control the band edges of the materials. At the moment, a vast majority of reports are focused on the C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> or C<small><sub>4</sub></small>N type of configuration. In order to prepare MCNs with different nitrogen contents, a careful selection of carbon and nitrogen precursors together with a suitable carbonization temperature and the choice of hard template are required to achieve MCNs with different nitrogen contents. The textural parameters of the reported C<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small> type of MCNs are not so impressive, which further opens opportunities to devise a new methodology for the synthesis of MCNs with a higher surface area and pore volume. It would also be interesting to prepare MCNs with controlled morphologies, crystal structures, and porous structures, and to study the effects of morphology and band structure on the photo-catalytic applications.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another important aspect of MCNs that has not been explored sufficiently is to use them in energy storage and conversion applications. It is expected that these metal free MCNs have the capabilities to replace the so-called “golden photocatalyst” titania for dye sensitised quantum dots and organic solar cells. These materials could also be used as electrodes for supercapacitors, fuel cells, and battery applications and it is quite surprising that MCNs have not been effectively utilized for supercapacitors, batteries and fuel cell applications. It is also expected that MCNs, after proper functionalization with metal or metal oxide nanoparticles or different functional groups on the surface will further expand their application possibilities in catalysis. For example, the introduction of acid functionalities on the surface of MCNs, which already have basic functionalities together with semiconducting features, would enable MCNs to be used as enzyme-like catalysts for efficient and highly specific organic transformations with the help of light radiation.</p>
