        <h3 id="sect283"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Background of energy harvesting</span></h3>
        <span>Energy is one of the most important resources that dictates the quality of our life. With the limited fossil energy available for the next century, searching for a new energy source has been a major challenge facing today's society. The most familiar renewable energies are solar, wind and tide energy, which are targeted to contribute to the major power grids to meet the needs of mega- to giga-watt power scales. The general requirements for harvesting these types of energies are low-cost, high stability and high efficiency.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In the last two decades, the vast applications and distributions of mobile electronics have reached every corner of our life. Vast types of sensors for health monitoring, medical care, environmental protection, infrastructure monitoring and security have been developed. The power for driving each unit is small and can be down to milli to micro-watt range, but the number of units can be huge. As predicted by Cisco, by 2020 the world will have trillions of sensor units distributed on the earth.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> The recent development of internet of things (IoT) and sensor networks dramatically change the traditional understanding about energy. The general characteristics of these types of power units are mobility, availability and sustainability. The most conventional technology is using batteries, which may not be the solution for IoT. For trillions of batteries that are vastly distributed and each having a limited life time, monitoring, replacing, recycling and exchanging batteries would be a huge and even an impossible task. Most of the IoT would be impossible without making the devices self-powered.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> It is thus desirable to integrate an energy harvester together with a battery to form a self-powered system and it is likely to be an ideal choice.

        <h3 id="sect291"><span class="b_heading">1.2 Nanogenerators</span></h3>
        <span>Today's electronics is mostly associated with human activities for the purpose of health, safety and communication. The most abundant energy associated with humans is mechanical energy as a result of body motion. A nanogenerator was first introduced to harvest human energy from walking, talking, breathing, typing and more by utilizing two effects: piezoelectricity<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4–9</span></sup></a> and triboelectricity.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10–12</span></sup></a> Using the strain induced piezoelectric polarization in certain crystals, such as ZnO and PZT, the potential created by polarization charges can drive the flow of electrons across two electrodes placed on the top and bottom surfaces of the crystal. This is the general principle of piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG). We have spent the last 10 years in developing the PENG, which has been reported systematically in existing literature studies.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13–18</span></sup></a></span>

      <h2 id="sect313"><span class="a_heading">2. Four fundamental working modes of the TENG</span></h2>
      <span>Triboelectrification is an effect that is known to each and every one probably ever since the ancient Greek time, but it is usually taken as a negative effect and is avoided in many technologies. Discharges caused by triboelectricity have caused many disastrous damages to industrial processes, electronics, human life and nature, such as wild fire. But this effect exists almost everywhere in our life and for any material that we use each day, so that it is not limited to any specific material. Our goal here is to use triboelectricity for converting mechanical energy into electricity based on new materials and new designs.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">As for TENGs, under open-circuit conditions, a potential difference between two electrodes attached on the back side of the films is created by the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction. The triboelectric charges are generated due to the charge transfer between two thin organic/inorganic films that exhibit distinct surface electron affinity, and the potential difference results from the separation of the triboelectric charges; under short-circuit conditions, electrons are driven to flow between two electrodes attached on the back side of the films through the load to balance the potential difference resulting from mechanical action. Here we first introduce the four fundamental modes of the TENG, which are the basics for various prototypes of TENGs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a></p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect319"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Vertical contact-separation mode</span></h3>
        <span>The vertical contact-separation mode was the first invented operation mode for TENGs.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27–29</span></sup></a> A physical contact between the two dielectric films with distinct electron affinity (at least one is insulative) creates oppositely charged surfaces. Once the two surfaces are separated by a gap, a potential drop is created between the electrodes deposited on the top and bottom surfaces of two dielectric films, as demonstrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2a</a>. If the two electrodes are electrically connected by a load, free electrons in one electrode would flow to the other electrode in order to balance the electrostatic field. Once the gap is closed, the potential drop created by triboelectric charges disappears, the induced electrons will flow back. A periodic contact and separation between the two materials drives the induced electrons to flow back and forth between the two electrodes, resulting in an AC output in the external circuit.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">In this mode, the electricity generation process depends on a periodic switching between the contact and separation states of the two contact surfaces, and the output is AC. To realize this type of mechanical motion, various structural designs were developed, including arch-shaped,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> spring-supported,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30,31</span></sup></a> zig-zag,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32,33</span></sup></a> cantilever based,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> and so on. TENGs based on this working mode excel in cyclic motions, intermittent impact or shock. This mode was featured as a simple structural design, great device robustness, and high instantaneous power density. However, an indispensable design of the vertical contact-separation mode is a cavity with constantly changing volume, which renders a challenge for the packaging of the TENG.</p>

        <h3 id="sect344"><span class="b_heading">2.2 In-plane sliding mode</span></h3>
        <span>As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2b</a>, when two materials with opposite triboelectric polarities, for instance, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and aluminum, are brought into contact, surface charge transfer takes place due to the triboelectrification effect. Since PTFE holds a higher electron affinity than aluminum, electrons are injected from aluminum into PTFE. When the PTFE and Al are fully aligned, the electric field created by the triboelectric charges does not produce a potential drop, because the positive charges on aluminum are fully compensated by the negative ones on PTFE. Once a relative displacement is introduced by an externally applied force in the direction parallel to the interface, triboelectric charges are not fully compensated at the displaced/mismatched areas, resulting in the creation of an effective dipole polarization in parallel to the direction of the displacement. Therefore, a potential difference across the two electrodes is generated. A sliding back and forth between the two will result in a periodical change in the electric potential difference, which will drive free electrons to flow alternatively across the electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45,46</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">The in-plane sliding mode holds several important advantages compared to the vertical contact-separation mode. The generation of triboelectric charges from the relative sliding between two surfaces is much more effective than the pure contact, which contributes to a greatly enhanced output power for practical applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46</span></sup></a> Furthermore, the in-plane sliding mode is easy to develop a more advanced design for high-performance TENGs. For instance, through a grating structure, the total amount of transported charges is greatly enhanced.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20,45,47</span></sup></a> With constant sliding velocity, finer grating shortens the time to transport induced charges between the electrodes, which enables substantial enhancement of both the magnitude and frequency of the output current.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The in-plane sliding mode excels in harvesting energy from planar motions,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45,46,48</span></sup></a> disc rotation<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49,50</span></sup></a> and cylindrical rotation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a> And it was demonstrated to harvest wind energy,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> hydropower,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> rotational kinetic energy,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> and so on.

        <h3 id="sect362"><span class="b_heading">2.3 Single-electrode mode</span></h3>
        <span>For both the vertical contact-separation mode and in-plane sliding mode triboelectric nanogenerators, the moving objects need to be bonded with an electrode and a lead wire. Such a device configuration largely limits TENGs' versatility and applicability for harvesting energy from an arbitrary, freely moving object, because the object has to be connected to the entire system by an interconnector. A single electrode mode TENG was developed to solve this problem.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> As demonstrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2c</a>, this mode consists of, for instance, a PTFE moving object and an aluminum layer electrically connected to the ground. In the original position, PTFE and aluminum are fully in contact with each other, which will result in electrons being injected from aluminum to PTFE since PTFE has higher surface electron affinity than aluminum. Once the negatively charged PTFE slides apart or separates, a decrease of the induced positive charges on Al occurs, and the electrons will flow from the ground to aluminum till the two plates are entirely separated, in order to balance the electric potential. Then, when PTFE slides backward or comes into contact again, the induced positive charges on the aluminum increase, driving the electrons to flow from aluminum to the ground till the two plates are fully overlapped to re-establish an electrostatic equilibrium. This is a full cycle of the electricity generation process of the single-electrode mode TENG.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In the single electrode mode, although the induced electron transfer across the electrode is not effective due to the electrostatic screening effect,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57</span></sup></a> one of the triboelectric layers can move freely without any restriction.

        <p class="otherpara">A typical characteristic of the TENG is high output voltage but low current. In order to enhance the total output current at the expense of the output voltage, the grating structure is an effective and advanced design, which is mainly attributed to the multiplied charge separation cycles in a grated structure. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4a</a> shows a finite element method model for the grating structure with unequal length plates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> In the model, the length of the bottom part is set to 2<span class="italic">L</span>, which is twice the length of the top part.

Furthermore, the influence of the grating units is systematically investigated. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4c</a>, with increasing grating units, the short-circuit current is obviously increased, while the open-circuit voltage follows a reverse trend, as demonstrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4d</a>.

In the first region, the resistance is low and in a range of 0.1 to 1000 Ω, and the peak current shows little drop compared with that under short-circuit conditions. In region 2, the peak current drops dramatically while the peak voltage increases following an inverse trend. In region 3, where the external resistance is usually larger than 1 GΩ, the output voltage is close to and saturated at that of the open-circuit condition.</p>

Furthermore, the stored charge–time relationship at different load capacitances was also studied. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5f</a>, at the beginning, the curves for all load capacitors converge to a linear curve.

        <p class="otherpara">The TENG can deliver an optimum average output power of ∼1.5 W at the matched load of ∼0.8 MΩ under a rotation rate of 3000 r min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which corresponds to an average output power density of 19 mW cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. To demonstrate the capability of the TENG as a direct power source, regular light bulbs were electrically connected as indicators. Under the rotation rate of 1000 r min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, a total of 20 spot lights were simultaneously lighted up, providing sufficient illumination even for reading the printed text in complete darkness (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6f</a>). And the generated power can also light up a white globe light (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6g</a>). Furthermore, the TENG can also be applied to harvest energy from ambient environment. First, the TENG can harvest mechanical energy from body movement. As illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6h</a>, the compact-sized TENG in a hand had pieces of inertia mass fixed on the rotator. As the hand swung back and forth in small amplitude, the generated power from the relative sliding friction between the rotator and stator can light up 15 spot lights simultaneously. Then the TENG was demonstrated to harvest energy from light air flow at a flow speed of 6 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and still 15 spot lights were lighted up simultaneously (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6i</a>). In addition, the TENG is capable of harvesting energy from water flow. At a flow rate of 5.5 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, the generated electricity can also light up 15 spot lights simultaneously. In addition, a power supplying system was further established, which consists of a TENG and a power management circuit. And it can deliver a DC output at a constant voltage of 5 V in less than 0.5 s after the TENG starts to operate. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6k</a>, the power supplying system is able to serve as a charging source for batteries. Since 5 V is the standard charging voltage for most of the commercial portable electronics, a cell phone automatically turned on once the voltage output shot to 5 V due to the operation of the TENG.</p>

Thus, the optimum effective current is also linearly related to the sliding velocity, as demonstrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7e</a>. To evaluate the capability of the MG-TENG for power generation, resistors were utilized as external loads for characterization. As displayed in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7f</a>, the current amplitude drops with increasing load resistance owing to the ohmic loss, and the effective power is maximized to a value of 0.76 W at a load resistance of 1 MΩ and a sliding velocity of 2 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

Manipulating the surface charge density can potentially be utilized to enhance the output performance of energy harvesting devices or nullify contact electric charge transfer. Different approaches have been made to modulate the surface charge density.

An energy band diagram for the metal and dielectric materials in the situations of pre-contact is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9a</a>. When the bias is more positive than the nullified bias, electrons will flow from the dielectric to the metal, leaving the dielectric surface positively charged. In the meantime, a negative bias to the metal can raise the Fermi energy level, driving more electrons to flow to the dielectric surface to fill up the higher surface energy states, which will lead to a more negatively charged dielectric surface compared with that without an applied electric field.</span>

On one hand, the batteries can provide a constant voltage at the discharging plateau to act as the direct power sources for most portable electronics.

To lower the output voltage while preserving the total power, a multilayered-electrode-based TENG (ME-TENG) is demonstrated, as sketched in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11d</a>, which is designed by allowing the current to flow multiple times controlled by a mechanical switch during the sliding of the TENG.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> Under an identical channel load resistance of 22 MΩ, the output voltage and current curves of the four-channel ME-TENG is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11e</a>.

        <h3 id="sect735"><span class="b_heading">5.1 TENG-based AC–AC hybrid cells</span></h3>
        <span>Besides the TENGs, many other types of mechanical energy harvesting approaches have been developed, including the piezoelectric generators, the electromagnetic generators, and the electrostatic generators. Each of them has their unique advantages and drawbacks, while the output profiles are all in an alternating manner. Hence, by integrating TENGs with one of the above-mentioned generators, the hybrid cell is enabled to take advantages of both of their unique characteristics. For instance, the electromagnetic generator requires much lower optimum resistance, and the output current is also much higher, while its output voltage is lower than that of the TENG.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> demonstrated a hybrid cell composed of a TENG and an electromagnetic induction generator (EMIG), as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> First, the theoretical governing equations for both the TENG and EMIG were compared, and their structural and output similarities were revealed. Moreover, the output performances of both the TENG and EMIG for harvesting mechanical energies from both reciprocating and rotating motions were presented. It was then concluded that the EMIG could serve as a voltage source with a low internal impedance, and the TENG could work as a current source with much higher internal impedance. For integration of the two power generators, the generated output could be rectified and connected both in series and in parallel. In parallel connection, the hybrid cell behaves like an ideal voltage source, with a low optimum resistance of 12.3 Ω. While in series connection, the hybrid cell behaves like an ideal current source, with a high optimum resistance of 13.8 MΩ. In both cases, the optimum output power was only close to that of the EMIG in parallel connection or the TENG in series connection, and almost half of the power output was lost through the coupling of the two power generators because of the mismatch of internal impedances.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">To solve this compatibility problem, the rectified EMIG was connected with a resistor in series connection and the rectified TENG was connected with a resistor in parallel connection. With this power transforming approach, the optimum resistances of both generators were brought much closer to 9.43–9.77 kΩ, with their output power of 117.6–118.1 nW.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">For a conjunction operation of the EMIG and TENG, the two rotary generators shared the same shaft, and connected with an external resistor in series and parallel, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12a</a>). Then, the two transformed generators could be connected in both parallel mode and series mode, and their integrated output powers are displayed in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12b</a>. The maximum power of 202.8 nW was delivered with an optimized external resistance of 4.67 kΩ for the two power sources in parallel connection, while the maximum power of 209.7 nW was obtained with an optimized external resistance of 18.1 kΩ for the two power sources in serial connection. Both values were close to the theoretical value of 235.2 nW, confirming the high efficiency of this conjunction approach. Fan <span class="italic">et al.</span> also did a comparison between the EMIG and TENG, and it was also found that the power output performances of the EMIG and the TENG have a special complementary relationship, with the EMG being a voltage source and the TEG a current source.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> Alternatively, Hu <span class="italic">et al.</span> demonstrated another approach to hybridize the TENG and the EMIG in a more compact approach,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit107"><sup><span class="sup_ref">107</span></sup></a> as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12c</a>. The basic device structure is composed of a smaller hollow cube with an opening bottom floating on top of a solid stand with a larger hollow cube surrounding it. The side wall surfaces of the solid stand and the larger hollow cube are covered with copper foil, and copper-coated Kapton thin films are attached on both the inner and outer surfaces of the smaller hollow cube. The floating of the smaller hollow cube is maintained by the balance between its gravity and the repulsive force between two magnets embedded in the solid stand and the smaller hollow cube, respectively. The two contact surfaces between Kapton films and copper foils construct two sliding-mode TENGs (S-TENGs), as indicated by the right inset of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12c</a>. Then, a copper wire is wrapped around the outer surface of the larger hollow cube with 300 turns. As the floating magnet is oscillating with an external force, the magnetic flux in the coil will be altered, and an output current will be produced in the coil due to electromagnetic induction. The output performances of both the TENG and the EMIG were recorded. The EMIG generates a high short-circuit current of up to 12.5 mA, but a low open-circuit voltage of 1.5 V. On the contrary, the open-circuit voltage of the TENG can reach at around 500 V with an integrated short-circuit current of 30 μA at the sliding mode or 400 μA at the contact mode. In terms of frequency dependence of the output performance, <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> of the TENG keeps constant with increasing frequencies, while its <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> increases with the frequency of motions. On the other hand, both <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> of the EMIG increase drastically with the frequency, indicating the distinct working principles between the EMIG and the TENG. The optimum output powers of the TENG and the EMIG are 22.5 mW and 5.8 mW, respectively, with the matching resistance of 10 MΩ and 90 Ω. To obtain impedance match between the two contributing power generators, power transformers were connected with the TENG and EMIG to adjust their optimized external resistance of around 5 kΩ with the maximum output power of 7.7 and 1.9 mW. The loss of power is mainly attributed to the inconsistency of working frequency between the power generators (12 Hz) and the transformers (60 Hz), which can be greatly improved by adjusting the working frequency or the type of transformers.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A major advantage of this new hybrid cell is that due to the rational design, the output signals from both the TENG and EMIG are in phase. Thus, they can be added constructively and directly. Another important characteristic of the device after impedance match is that the output voltages from both the TENG and EMIG are adjusted to a similar level, at around 4.6 V with a matched load of 5 kΩ. The output current in the EMIG and TENG in this case is about 0.4 and 1.6 mA, respectively. When these two parts were connected in parallel, the output voltage was maintained, and the output current increased to 2.2 mA, which is slightly larger than the sum of the output currents from the EMIG and TENG. The hybrid output power was then regulated using a commercial power management circuit board (LTC3588-1, Linear Technology). The AC signals were rectified by the full-wave bridge, and the generated charges were stored in the capacitors, by which a regulated output voltage of 3.3 V was achieved in a three-step process, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12d</a>. It can be found that the time required to charge the board for the hybrid cell is less than that for each of the individual generator. With the regulated output power and the constant output voltage, the hybrid cell was enabled to drive a half-adder circuit, which demonstrated an important application of the hybrid cell in self-powered computation and processors.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Besides the above studies that employ the hybridization of triboelectrification and electromagnetic induction, a few more efforts were also made to develop other types of hybrid cells with two power generators with AC output characteristics. For instance, Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span> fabricated a hybrid cell based on the triboelectric effect between PET and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and the pyroelectric effect of a PZT thin film.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> Hence, this hybrid cell can be utilized to simultaneously harvest mechanical and thermal energies. The hybrid output power was rectified and stored in a lithium ion battery, and self-powered degradation methyl orange was realized by the hybrid energy cell, due to the generation of a super-oxidative hydroxyl radical on the anode. This research opens up potential applications in waste water treatment. Moreover, Zi <span class="italic">et al.</span> continued to develop a new technology to scavenge the heat flow energy caused by the friction motion of a sliding TENG.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> In this work, a triboelectric–pyroelectric–piezoelectric hybrid cell was fabricated with PTFE and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thin films to effectively harvest the reciprocating mechanical energy. First, the sliding TENG worked based on the sliding motion between the Al and the PTFE thin films. Then, the pyroelectric and piezoelectric effects of the underlying PVDF thin film was employed for harvesting the friction-induced heat energy and the mechanical energy from the variation of the normal force, respectively. This hybrid cell has been demonstrated to extend the illumination time of a light-emitting diode (LED) and to quickly charge a capacitor. Furthermore, it can also be applied as a self-powered temperature and force sensor during the friction motion. Bai <span class="italic">et al.</span> also demonstrated the output power enhancement of TENG by coupling of contact electrification and the piezoelectric effect of PVDF thin film.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> In this work, the triboelectric charge density was significantly improved due to the piezoelectric polarization in the forward direction. <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> was improved by 36.3% as compared to the non-polarized TENG, while a decrease of output was observed for the reversely polarized counterpart, and the improvement mechanism was verified. Similarly, Han <span class="italic">et al.</span> also developed a r-shaped hybrid nanogenerator by use of the piezoelectric effect of PVDF and the triboelectric effect between aluminum and PDMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> Through one cycle of electric generation of the hybrid cell, 10 light-emitting diodes are lighted up instantaneously, and a 4-bit liquid crystal display can display continuously for more than 15 s. The hybridization between the piezoelectric and triboelectric effect was also demonstrated using a 3D fiber-based nanogenerator, which is composed of one coaxial carbon fiber and one nylon fiber.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> ZnO nanorods were grown on the carbon fiber and deposited with the Cu electrode on top. A layer of PDMS thin film deposited with the Cu electrode was wrapped around this composite structure with an insulating nylon film. In the operation of the hybrid nanogenerator, the nylon fiber contacts the PDMS layer and is pressed on the carbon-fiber-based composite structure. Hence, the piezoelectric output can be measured from the conducting carbon fiber and the copper electrode on top of the ZnO nanorod array; and the triboelectric output can be generated between the copper electrode on the PDMS layer and the ground. This hybrid nanogenerator can be further applied as a self-powered pressure sensor for anti-theft detection.</p>

        <span>As compared to the AC–AC hybrid cell, the other type of hybrid cell usually consists of a TENG for harvesting mechanical energy, and another nanogenerator for harvesting other types of energy sources, like thermal, chemical, and solar energies. In this regard, the other component of the hybrid cell may display distinct output characteristics and performances. First, most of these power generators have high output current but low output voltage; second, the internal impedance of these energy cells are usually much lower than that of the TENG; third, the output profile of these energy cells are usually constant DC signals rather than oscillating AC signals.

The working principle of this rotary TENG has been reported previously. With a rotation speed of 600 rpm, <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> of the TENG can reach up to 240 V and 1 mA, respectively. The output current can be further boosted to 11 mA using a power transformer, and the voltage is reduced to 17 V, with a transforming efficiency of 78% (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14e and f</a>). The transformed output terminals were directly connected to the cathode and anode for the water splitting unit (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14g</a>). Pt wires were selected as both electrodes, and 30% (w.t.) KOH solution was utilized as the electrolyte. With the potential applied by the TENG, O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> were produced at the anode and the cathode, respectively. In order to collect the produced H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the cathode was inserted into a top-sealed tube. The volume of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production with increased time is illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14h</a>, and the linear relationship indicates a production rate of 6.25 × 10<small><sup>−3</sup></small> mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This hydrogen production rate was tested with various rotation speeds and electrolyte solutions, and it was found that the production rate increases almost linearly with increasing rotating speed, and a higher production rate could be achieved with a 30% KOH solution, which might be due to higher concentration and lower resistance. Moreover, the splitting of pure water could even be completed with the high output voltage of the TENG without a transformer, while it could not be acquired by a 10 V electrochemical workstation, for the large resistance of pure water. Finally, the concept of “self-powered water splitting” was successfully demonstrated by the TENG driven by water flow. In this experiment, the TENG was mounted to a miniaturized water turbine, and then driven by a tap water flow of 3 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A capacitor of 1000 μF was employed as a charge reservoir, and it was charged from 1.7 V to 4.5 V in 60 min. As a result, a hydrogen volume of 0.3 × 10<small><sup>−3</sup></small> mL was generated, which corresponded to a total charge transfer of 2.57 mC.

As a result, the reaction was verified through a number of factors, including the pH value in the underlying solution, the generation of precipitation in a BCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>–HCl solution, and the degree of corrosion of a copper mesh. On the other hand, the removal of dust relied on electrostatic precipitation initiated by the electrical field between two plate electrodes, as shown in the schematic of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14i</a>. Since the dust aerosol was either positively or negatively charged due to electrification between air and particles, charged particles would be drawn onto the corresponding plate electrodes by columbic force, and the amount of dust removal could be measured by the weight accumulation of the plate electrode. With the control experiment as presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14j</a>, the copper mesh could absorb 32.7 wt% of dust particles with a potential difference of 300 V provided by the TENG, while no obvious mass change could be observed using the same system without TENG connection.

      <span>The rapid development of internet of things (IoTs) requires wireless, multi-functional, and independent operation of sensor networks. Considering the large number and small scale of sensors, the implantation of traditional power supply will be a big challenge, and developing self-powered sensors that can employ the ambient environmental energy is highly desired. In this regard, the self-powered active sensors based on TENGs will be an optimum solution. As a new power generation technology, TENGs can be used to convert mechanical energy into electricity; on the other hand, by analyzing the electrical output signals (including <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small>, <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small>, frequency, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) of TENGs, the information on the mechanical input (magnitude and frequency) can be successfully retrieved. Since this sensing technology originates from the output signals of the TENG itself, no external power source is required to apply onto the device, which is a unique advantage over conventional sensor technologies. By correlating the mechanical input with many other parameters, a lot of prototypes have been realized for various applications, including pressure detection, motion sensing, acoustic sensing, environmental monitoring, security check, <span class="italic">etc</span>.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect876"><span class="b_heading">6.1 TENGs as self-powered pressure/touch sensors</span></h3>
        <span>The output performance of a TENG is greatly affected by magnitude/frequency of the external mechanical stimuli, and the pressure applied onto the device is among the most critical parameters. Hence, the most straightforward application for TENG-based active sensors would be the quantification of external pressure/touch. The first proof-of-concept prototype was realized on a transparent flexible TENG, with the micropatterned plastic surface to enhance the triboelectric charge density.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> The self-powered pressure sensor was enabled to sense gentle pressures like a water droplet (8 mg, ∼3.6 Pa in contact pressure) and a falling feather (20 mg, ∼0.4 Pa in contact pressure) through relative deformation between two polymer sheets by external pressure. To obtain a more quantitative understanding of the contact-mode TENG based active pressure sensor, the TENG-based active pressure sensor was further developed and comprehensively characterized to reveal its basic sensing capabilities. In this work, the gap distance was employed as a critical factor to correlate the applied pressure and the potential difference across the two electrodes of the TENG. Based on both numerical calculations and experimental measurements, it was revealed that the relative variation of the <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> of the TENG should be expected to show direct linear relationship with the applied pressure. Therefore, <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> was a reliable parameter for static measurement of the magnitude of the external pressure, while <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> was able to provide its dynamic information (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> loading rate). The characterization of the pressure sensor indicated a high sensitivity of 0.31 kPa<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, with a low-end detection limit of ∼2 Pa, as well as excellent stability of over 30<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 cycles. Finally, a 6 × 6 pressure sensor array was integrated onto a common aluminum electrode for instantaneously mapping the applied pressure distribution, which was realized through multi-channel measurements and presented as a contour plot of the output profile of all the TENG units.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> This design will open up many potential applications in electronic skin and touch screen. A similar design was proposed by integrating an array of single-electrode TENGs, and the pressure mapping could be visualized by illuminating the LEDs using the power output from each individual TENG unit.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> Future studies are anticipated to enhance the spatial resolution of tactile imaging through microelectronic fabrication and advanced structural designs.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The performance of such active touch sensors was further improved by Zhu <span class="italic">et al.</span> through a self-powered tactile sensor based on flexible thin film materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> The schematic structure of this device is illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15a</a>, in which a layer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) deposited with ITO electrodes on both sides formed the structural backbone of the triboelectric sensor (TES). Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) thin film was applied on top as a triboelectric layer for contact electrification with a foreign object. Vertically aligned polymer nanowires (PNWs) were created on the FEP layer (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15b</a>) to assist the generation of triboelectric charges. To evaluate the performance of the TES to a contact event, a square-shaped TES (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15c</a>) was utilized to detect a piece of metal by cyclic contact and separation. As presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15d</a>, at an applied pressure of 0.03 kPa, the TES produced a uniform output voltage with a maximum magnitude of 35 V. As the contact pressure increased, the output voltage was raised to 50 V when the contact pressure approached 10 kPa (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15e</a>). This increasing behavior was attributed to the increase of effective contact area between the metal object and the TES. The voltage–pressure curve exhibited two distinct slopes, which was in agreement with the previously mentioned contact-mode active pressure sensor. In the low-pressure region (&lt;0.15 kPa), an exceptional pressure sensitivity of 44 mV Pa<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was obtained, corresponding to a sensitivity factor of 0.09% Pa<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. In the relatively high-pressure region (&gt;2 kPa), the pressure sensitivity dropped to 0.5 mV Pa<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. It was proposed that the two-region behavior was related to the enhancement effect from the PNWs. The dependence of its touch sensitivity on various factors was systematically tested, such as the applied pressure, the size of the touching object, and the length of PNWs. To demonstrate the practical application of the tactile sensor, a complete wireless sensing system was developed through integrating the TES with a signal-processing circuit. The system relied on the output voltage from the TES to trigger an IC timer that controlled a wireless transmitter for remotely switching a siren alarm. As indicated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15f</a>, the sensing system immediately started operation once a human hand touched the door handle. Through substituting other functional electronics for the wireless transmitter in the circuit, the sensing system could be adopted for more purposes. For example, a touch-enabled switch for a panel light was successfully developed and is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15g</a>. The TES in this work had a number of other unique advantages, including ultrahigh sensitivity, self-generated output, location independence, and outstanding robustness. In addition, the TES was generally applicable to objects made from various materials, indicating the widespread adaptability of the TES in a variety of circumstances.</p>

        <span>A mechanical motion can be described with a series of parameters, like displacement, velocity, acceleration, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Sensors for detection of these parameters are vitally important for mechanical systems with moving parts. TENGs have been developed to generate electricity from different types of mechanical motions, such as linear sliding, rotation, and rolling. Since the frequencies and amplitudes of the generated electrical signals are all directly related to the parameters of the input mechanical motions, TENGs can play the role of self-powered active motion sensors. Even if such motions are located in concealed locations, TENGs can be utilized to track the trajectory and detect the instantaneous parameters of the motions.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Zhou <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a self-powered, one-dimensional displacement and speed sensor with high spatial resolution, large dynamic range and long detecting distance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16a</a>, the motion sensor consisted of two micro-grating layers with identical patterns. The bottom layer was an etched silicon wafer coated with aluminum as the bottom electrode and silicon dioxide as one of the triboelectric material to generate positive charges; the top layer was a patterned SU-8 film on a glass slide as a supporting substrate, which was subsequently coated with ITO and Parylene film as the top electrode and the other triboelectric material to generate negative charges, respectively. The detailed structure of the as-fabricated devices can be found in the SEM images shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16b and c</a>, respectively. The relative motion between two gratings results in periodic separation of two micro-grated triboelectric materials that are oppositely charged through triboelectrification. As a result, an alternating electric signal between the two electrodes placed was detected due to electrostatic induction. During the movement, <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> measured between the two electrodes (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16d</a>) alternated between 0 and ∼160 mV periodically, and the real time displacement could be calculated by counting the number of voltage peaks and multiplying the number with the width of each grating (200 μm). As presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16e</a>, the detected displacement increased linearly with time, and the real time motion speed could also be calculated by dividing the grating width by the time interval between two adjacent peaks. Starting from a status with complete overlap, a step motion test with each step of 5 μm was performed to investigate the resolution of the displacement sensor. The sensitive region was found to be from 10 μm to 190 μm, where each step motion of 1 μm could be clearly identified from the voltage variation, as displayed in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16f</a>. The change in the voltage for each step was about 2.2 mV, and the root mean square (RMS) of the noise <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>noise</sub></small> at 1 Hz is 0.38 mV.

Taking advantage of vibration-induced periodical contact and separation of two triboelectric surfaces, a contact-mode TENG can be employed for both harvesting vibration energy and detecting the magnitude, frequency, and location of a vibration source. A few prototypes have been developed in this field of TENG-based self-powered vibration sensors. One typical example is the 3D spiral structure, which was composed of a conical-shaped spring, a seismic mass loaded on the spring, and another acrylic plate fixed beneath the seismic mass.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> The triboelectric materials were attached on the surfaces between the seismic mass and the underlying plate, and the spiral triboelectric nanogenerator (STENG) was operated by the oscillation of the spring stimulated by an external vibration. The STENG was further demonstrated for vibration source positioning on a wood board, and three STENGs were installed on its three corners, respectively. The output signals were recorded once a vibration was incurred at a specified location on the board, and its position could be precisely tracked through monitoring the arriving time in the three different measurement channels and derived with simple calculations. The location error of this measurement was as low as 5.8%, which could be further reduced by increasing the sampling rate of the measurement system. Beside this work, several other structure designs have also been proposed for harvesting vibration energy, such as the harmonic-resonator-based TENG,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> the 3D TENG with broadband response,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> the 3D stack integrated TENG,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> the triple-cantilever-based TENG,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> and the integrated rhombic gridding based TENG.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> They all can be utilized as the self-powered active sensor to detect external vibrations.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, to obtain a more quantitative and accurate amplitude measurement of vibrations, Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span> first developed a contact-based freestanding-triboelectric-layer mode triboelectric nanogenerator (CF-TENG), in which the vibration of the freestanding triboelectric layer between the two electrodes periodically changes the induced potential difference between the two electrodes and thus generates electricity in an external load.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> In such a structure with the lateral dimension of electrodes much larger than their vertical separation distance, the electricity generation had a linear relationship with the moving distance of the freestanding layer. The linear characteristic gave the CF-TENG the supreme capability of quantitatively sensing the amplitude of the vibration, as long as it is within the small range. Specifically, at its resonant frequency, the CF-TENG showed very high sensitivity for even subtle vibration magnitude. For example, when the vibration amplitude was only 3.5 μm, the peak-to-peak value of <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> and the amplitude of <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> generated by the CF-TENG still had 0.54 V and 10 nA, respectively. Even when the vibration frequency was off the resonant frequency of the CF-TENG, it still showed good linear behavior at a high vibration magnitude of up to 15 mm.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Acoustic wave is a specific form of vibration ubiquitously existing in the environment, and the sensing of acoustic waves is vitally important not only for information technology, but also for the monitoring of equipment systems and environment. With the possibility of converting sound waves into electricity, TENGs could provide an effective approach for realizing the self-powered acoustic sensing. The first organic thin-film based TENG was developed to realize acoustic energy harvesting and self-powered acoustic sensing in a wide frequency range available in our daily life.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> This acoustic TENG relied on a Helmholtz cavity with a size-tunable narrow neck on its back. The core part was in a circular shape and embedded as the flexible front plate of the cavity, as schematically depicted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17a</a>. When an external sound wave was incident on the core part of the device, the cavity structure would lead to a pressure difference and oscillation of the PTFE thin film (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17b</a>). Assisted by the nanopores on the aluminum surface (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17c</a>) and the nanowire structure on the PTFE thin film (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17d</a>), contact electrification was enabled between aluminum and PTFE to scavenge the acoustic energy from sound waves. Moreover, a self-powered microphone was demonstrated as an application of the TENG-based self-powered acoustic sensor. As demonstrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17e</a>, four TENGs with a series of dimensions corresponding to distinct resonant frequencies were employed to widen the overall working bandwidth from 10 to 1700 Hz, which enabled the superior performance of the TENG for sound recording. The time domain waveforms of the recorded sounds from NG<small><sub>1</sub></small> and NG<small><sub>4</sub></small> are shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17f1 and f3</a>, respectively. With a natural frequency of 350 Hz, the waveform of NG<small><sub>1</sub></small> was smoother owing to its dominant response to lower frequency components from 10 to 600 Hz, while the waveform of NG<small><sub>4</sub></small> with a natural frequency of 1400 Hz is rougher, due to its dominant response to the higher frequency components from 1100 to 1700 Hz, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17f2 and f4</a>, which were the corresponding short-time Fourier transform (STFT). In order to reconstruct the original sound, the acquired acoustic signals were weighted according to the relative amount of information available from each source. The waveform of the reconstructed signal and its corresponding STFT are illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17g and h</a>, respectively. The frequency components of the reconstructed signal covered all the frequencies ranging from 10 to 1700 Hz. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig17">Fig. 17i</a> shows an as-fabricated TENG working as a self-powered microphone for sound recording.

        <h3 id="sect1015"><span class="b_heading">6.4 TENGs as self-powered chemical/environmental sensors</span></h3>
        <span>As discussed in the previous sections, a key factor that determines the output performance of a TENG is the triboelectric charge density generated on the material surface upon contact electrification. Surface modification of certain chemical species and alteration of environmental factors will greatly affect the triboelectric charge density and thus the output power. Therefore, by monitoring the change in its output performance, a properly-designed TENG can serve as a self-powered chemical and environmental sensor for detection of ion concentration, UV illumination, humidity, <span class="italic">etc.</span></span>
        <p class="otherpara">The first work was done by Lin <span class="italic">et al.</span> for the detection of Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> ions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a> In a typical contact-mode TENG, Au nanoparticles (NPs) were assembled onto the metal plate to improve the contact area, and the NPs were further modified with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) molecules with strong Au–S interactions. The Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> ions in the buffer solution would be bound on 3-MPA molecules and the surface polarity of the metal plate would be subject to change, which then tuned the surface charge density accordingly. Hence, the detection of the Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> concentration was enabled by real time monitoring of the TENG's output performance. A linear relationship between the relative variation of <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> and the concentration of Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> ions indicated an effective detection range from 100 nM to 5 mM, and the selectivity of the developed system toward Hg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> ion detection as compared to other metal ions was confirmed with a control experiment. Following this work, a similar self-powered chemical sensor was fabricated for catechin detection by utilizing TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanomaterial array as the probe and contact material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> The sensor also presented high sensitivity and good selectivity, with a detection limit of 5 μM. TENGs based on water-solid electrification have been developed, which can serve as self-powered chemical and temperature sensors for the liquid. A self-powered active UV sensor was developed through integrating a built-in photodetector for UV light sensing with the TENG conformation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> The resistance of the built-in photodetector varied upon UV light irradiation with different intensities, which would consequently influence the measured output of the TENG from the two leads. In this way, the light intensity could be derived by monitoring the output of the TENG. An air-flow-driven TENG was developed as a self-powered humidity sensor with high sensitivity and simple fabrication.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Li <span class="italic">et al.</span> further expanded this concept to a more practical case for both self-powered phenol detection and its electrochemical degradation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> In this work, β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was selected both as a surface modification chemical to improve the performance of the TENG, but also as the recognition element for effectively detecting phenol molecules in aqueous solution. The as-fabricated TENG and nanosensor had a multilayered structure with acrylic as supporting substrates, as schematically depicted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18a</a>. In this typical contact-mode TENG structure, the top layer was a piece of PTFE thin film coated with copper electrode, and the bottom layer was Ti foil with TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanowires grown on its surface through a hydrothermal approach. β-CD molecules were then assembled onto the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanowires as a surface chemical modification. The measured <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> were increasingly proportional to the surface concentration of β-CD till a saturation point of 80 μM was reached, and the enhancement in electrical output was due to the charge transfer from β-CD to TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18b</a>). Assisted by the coordination effect between the hydroxyl groups in β-CD and the surface Ti atoms of the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanowires, more surface charge transfer then took place at the contact area upon triboelectrification between PTFE and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Moreover, the β-CD molecule is composed of a hydrophobic internal cavity and hydrophilic external surface, which allows it to form a host–guest inclusion complex <span class="italic">via</span> various guest molecules with a suitable polarity and dimension. The cavity diameter of β-CD has been found to be the most appropriate size for the selective adsorption of phenol, which explains β-CD as a surface chemical modification for phenol recognition. To evaluate the experimental performance of the phenol sensor, phenol solutions with various concentrations but constant volumes (20 μL) were dropped onto the surface of β-CD modified TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanowires on a 4 cm × 4 cm TENG (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18c</a>). The dependences of both the <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> on the phenol concentration were plotted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18d and e</a>, respectively, and it could be clearly found that both the <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> monotonically decreased with rising phenol concentration in a certain test range of 10–100 μM. The decay of output was mainly attributed to a modified surface triboelectric behavior, for phenol would replace the position of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to contact with PTFE. In comparison with TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, phenol molecules had a lower tendency to transfer the electrons to PTFE, resulting in lower output performance with increasing phenol concentration. The relative variation of the output voltage and current in response to varied phenol concentrations is plotted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18f</a>, from which a sensitivity of 0.02 μM<small><sup>−1</sup></small> could be derived.</p>

        <h3 id="sect1068"><span class="b_heading">6.5 TENGs for self-powered human–machine interfacing and biomedical monitoring</span></h3>
        <span>Despite various types of mechanical inputs described in the previous sections, human activity is also a kind of universally available mechanical source. Technologies in human–machine interfacing and biomedical monitoring have become more and more significant for rapid development of artificial intelligence and modern healthcare. Especially, a fatal weakness of the current authentication systems is that an identity thief/impostor can easily pass as the genuine owner with stolen personal identification information (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, password). Improvements regarding the issues can hardly be accomplished without having better identities that preferably cannot be easily separated from the owner of the computer. Here, the application of TENGs for biometric authentication can be harnessed to place an additional layer of stronger security on existing systems since they are intrinsic and harder to separate or mimic from the genuine owner. And they are featured as being inexpensive, less intrusive, and can be implemented easily on top of the current authentication systems without major modification. In a few recent studies, human activities including keyboard typing, voice, or blood flow could be precisely recognized and recorded with personal patterns as effective identification criteria to current authentication systems, which are important steps toward practical applications of TENGs and self-powered active sensors.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Keyboard is an indispensable input component for many personal electronics like computers and cell phones, and an advanced approach to provide multi-fold protection of electronic devices through a keyboard is highly desired for security purpose. Recently, Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span> invented an intelligent and self-powered keyboard as an advanced security safeguard against unauthorized access to computers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> Based on the triboelectric effect between human fingers and keys, the intelligent keyboard (IKB) could convert typing motions into localized electric signals that could be identified as personalized physiological information. The core part of the IKB was composed of multilayered transparent thin film materials to form a typical single-electrode TENG. A layer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was deposited with ITO electrodes on both sides, and the top ITO was laminated by a layer of FEP as the triboelectric material for contact electrification with bare human fingers (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19a</a>). A nanowire structure was created on the FEP surface to enhance the effective contact area (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19b</a>), which also introduced a self-cleaning surface. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19c</a> shows a photograph of a fully-assembled IKB with the same size as a commercial keyboard. The working principle of the IKB as an energy harvester was similar to the single-electrode TENG. The contact of human skin with the FEP surface would leave the finger positively charged, and the FEP negatively charged. The finger movement during typing would then induce change in the potential difference between the pair of ITO electrodes, driving electrons to flow through the external load or data collection system. To demonstrate the capability of the IKB to differentiate the input of each key, all of the TENG units on the keyboard were separately connected to a multi-channel measurement system, and the output data of all channels were collected during the typing event on individual keys.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">A typical output profile is presented in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19d</a>, in which the channel located on the key struck by the finger exhibited an instantaneous voltage peak of about 10 V, which was much larger than that in the rest of the channels. The recognition of key striking could even be recognized by screening the data using a Pauta Criterion Method, and simultaneously visualized on the display without noticeable delay (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19e</a>). As a novel approach for personalized typing verification and identification, the IKB was typed the word “touch” by three individuals for four times, and the characteristic electric signals (voltage and current) were analyzed through Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) to obtain their frequency features. It was found in the results that the frequency spectra of the voltage and the current from different individuals were distinct in terms of the position and amplitude of the major signal components. Meanwhile, wavelet transformation was further carried out to simultaneously obtain both time domain and frequency domain features of the typing patterns.

The Pearson correlation coefficient can be harnessed to express the uniqueness and permanence among individual typing patterns. A higher value of about 0.85 represents a superior permanence of the typing patterns, while a lower value of around 0.45 is indicative of excellent uniqueness among individuals.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of the IKB as an effective identifier, 104 randomly selected participants were invited to independently type the word “touch” for more than four times on the IKB in each accustomed manner. Subsequently, a collection of 104 individual typing patterns were divided into 52 client patterns and 52 impostor patterns. In the whole testing set of 104 typing patterns, the user template was composed of 52 client patterns, and the performance of the authentication biometrics was characterized through two error rates: False Rejection Rate (FRR) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR). Here, the FRR is the probability that the system incorrectly rejects access of an authorized person, due to failing to match the user template. While FRR is the percentage of valid inputs, which are incorrectly rejected. And the Pearson correlation coefficient was selected as the classification threshold to evaluate the behavioral biometric authentication system, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19f</a>. The FRR was increasing with the elevated threshold, while FAR follows a reverse trend, and their intersection indicated the Equal Error Rate (EER) point. The presented biometric authentication system achieved a remarkably lower EER value of 1.34% at the threshold of 0.37, as compared with traditional techniques. In the meanwhile, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is demonstrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19g</a>.

A layer of PTFE tympanic membrane was tented outwards at the level of the tip of an umbo (PET layer), which was centered at a nylon layer deposited with the ITO electrode. Two circular acoustic holes with diameters of 0.5 mm were punched through the multilayered structure, acting as communicating vessels to integrate the conical cavity with the ambient air (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20b</a>). Nanowire structures were created on the PTFE surface to enhance the contact area and the triboelectric charge density (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20c</a>). The working principle of the BMS was similar to a single-electrode TENG, except that the vibration pattern of the PTFE tympanic membrane varied with different frequencies.

        <p class="otherpara">The BMS provided an outstanding route to obtain the human arterial pulse wave in a self-powered and noninvasive manner. It was attached onto the carotid, wrist, and chest for real time monitoring of the arterial pulse, which induced a dynamic pressure change on the skin and could be characterized by the electrical output of the attached BMS. The recorded real-time voltage over several pulse periods for a 30-year-old man is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20d</a>, and the data were analyzed and compared with a 70-year-old man. Three clearly distinguishable determinants could be found in the characteristic pulse wave: systolic peak (<span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>S</sub></small>), point of inflection (<span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>i</sub></small>), and dicrotic wave (<span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>D</sub></small>), which originated from the blood ejected from the left ventricle, the reflected pulse wave, and the ejected blood back to the left ventricle, respectively. Despite the obvious difference in the pulse wave profile, a more quantitative comparison was accomplished by two commonly used parameters: the augmentation index AIx (%) = ±(<span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>S</sub></small> − <span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>i</sub></small>)/PP, and the reflection index RI = <span class="italic">h</span>/Δ<span class="italic">t</span>, where <span class="italic">h</span> is the subject height, Δ<span class="italic">t</span> is the time delay between <span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>S</sub></small> and <span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>D</sub></small>, while PP is the absolute pulse wave magnitude. Based on the acquired waveforms, a statistical result of the AIx and RI was, respectively, obtained for the young and old man, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20e</a>. For the younger man, average values of −30% and 6.8 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were, respectively, obtained for AIx and RI, while values of 24.8% and 13.3 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were obtained for the old man. The distinct difference in AIx and RI was mainly attributed to different arterial compliance capability between them. This difference could also be recognized through current measurements of the RMS. Meanwhile, the BMS could be attached to various body locations to obtain detailed information for cardiovascular risk estimation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition, the BMS could also serve as a self-powered throat-attached microphone for voice recording and biometric identification. Its voice recording capability was realized by analyzing the Fourier spectrum of the measured output voltage, and high frequency signals could be filtered from the mixed message to recover the speaking content, which was a substantial progress than the previous work. In terms of biometric recognition, four sets of arterial pulse wave patterns were obtained, and Euclidean Metric (EM) was calculated to measure the difference among pulse waves. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20f</a> shows the first-derivatives-of-the-pulse-waves (FDPWs) of the same person under different activity states, and its corresponding EMs were measured and compared with other individuals. It was discovered that the EM values of the FDPWs among different individuals were significantly larger than that for the same person under different activity states. Therefore, the distinguishable EMs of FDPWs could be used as the feature representation of pulse wave, acting as a threshold to separate the genuine pulse waves from the impostor ones, if an authentication system is established using pulse wave. The evaluation of this identification system was carried out among 120 randomly selected individuals, with 60 client patterns and 60 impostor patterns, respectively. The variation of its FAR and FRR in relation to the threshold is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20g</a>, and the intersection of the two curves at a certain threshold value of 7.3 × 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> indicated a low EER of 3.5%. On the basis of the numerous advantages of the BMS including self-powered, lightweight, simplicity in device fabrication, and outstanding reliability, the justified concepts and demonstrations in this work could be extensively adopted in the field of wearable medical/health monitoring as well as biometric authentication, and came into effect of improving our living style.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">To summarize, TENGs were widely and successfully adopted as self-powered active sensors (at least for the sensor tip part) under various circumstances, featured as being cost-effective, easy fabrication, and environmentally friendly. The device performance correlates with many variables including the characteristics of applied forces (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> frequency and magnitude), environmental conditions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> temperature and humidity) and also material stability, which also renders certain challenges to the reliability of TENGs as self-powered active sensors. Since the contact between two materials may be difficult to be precisely controlled especially in the contact-separation mode once the applied force/pressure is large, quantification of the output signal may be inaccurate if the mechanical triggering exceeds a threshold value. But for smaller mechanical stimulation, TENG can be a reliable and sensitive choice.</p>

      <span>Oceanic waves convey one of the most abundant energy sources on earth, with superior advantages over other energy sources including high volume, large scale, and much less dependence on weather, sunlight, and temperature conditions. However, this type of kinetic energy has rarely been exploited due to lack of suitable energy scavenging technologies. Since the invention and fast development of triboelectric nanogenerators as a new energy technology, a lot of efforts have been devoted to exploring approaches for effectively collecting various types of water-based power sources, namely blue energy harvesting. Up to now, several unique prototypes have been developed to achieve high output power, low cost, convenient fabrication, good flexibility, excellent stability and robustness, and possibility to scale up, as summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21</a>. Despite the state-of-art progress, more endeavors are still highly desired to further investigate in this field to improve the performance of the water-TENG towards practical applications in blue energy harvesting.</span>

        <h3 id="sect1144"><span class="b_heading">7.1 TENGs for harvesting water wave energy</span></h3>
        <span>The first design of the blue energy harvester was raised by Lin <span class="italic">et al.</span> in 2013, when the concept of water–solid contact electrification was first employed for energy harvesting in this work.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit134"><sup><span class="sup_ref">134</span></sup></a> The device structure of this water-TENG is schematically illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22a</a>, in which one dielectric layer of a typical contact-mode TENG was replaced with water. The cyclic contact between the PDMS layer and water surface would generate negative charges on the PDMS layer and positive charges on the water surface, and the periodical separation of the two charged surfaces resulted in change in potential difference between the two copper electrodes under OC conditions, and external electrons flow under SC conditions. Micropatterned pyramid array was created on the inner surface of the PDMS layer to enhance the effective contact area (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22b</a>), and this approach should be extraordinarily applicable in this case owing to high ductility of water. Driven by a linear motor at a frequency of 2 Hz and a magnitude of 1.5 cm, the water-TENG was enabled to produce a <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> of 82 V and 1.05 mA m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, respectively. The optimized output power density reached up to 50 mW m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> at 5 Hz. The frequency response of the water-TENG was significantly different from that of the solid-material-based TENG, in that the movement of the PDMS film contacting and separating from water would generate a water wave, which would disturb the contact area with the PDMS film. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22c and d</a> shows the frequency response of the measured <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small>, respectively. Both of them decreased first from 2 to 3 Hz and then increased with frequency from 3 to 5 Hz. On the contrary, for solid-material-based TENG, <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> would keep increasing with the frequency and <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> would remain almost unchanged. The difference of frequency response implied a unique feature of the water-TENG. It was further demonstrated that the water-TENG could serve as a self-powered temperature and ethanol sensor, through real time measurement of its output performance.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">Another basic prototype of water-TENG was based on asymmetric screening of the triboelectric charges on a nanostructured hydrophobic thin film surface, as exhibited in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22e</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a> Two parallel strip-shaped electrodes were deposited on one side of a FEP thin film, and they were separated with a fine gap in between. The other side of the FEP thin film was modified with nanowire structures for improving the effective contact area. The operation of the water-TENG relied on a repetitive emerging–submerging process with traveling water waves, in which the coupling between triboelectrification and electrostatic induction drove alternating flows of electrons between electrodes. Quantitative assessment of the output performance was also stimulated by a linear motor, and the generated <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> were 160 V and 3 μA, respectively, with an optimum output power of 0.12 mW at a velocity of 0.5 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22f</a>). Three extrinsic factors were systematically investigated to optimize the electric output of the water-TENG, including the velocity of the relative movement, the aspect ratio of the device, and the ion concentration of the water body. By conducting a series of control experiments, it was concluded that a higher velocity, finer electrode features, and lower ion concentration are all favorable for the overall output performance, though further systematic investigations on the charge generation process were still desirable to provide in-depth insights. To demonstrate the applicability of the water-TENG in real-world situations, an integrated TENG with a scaled-up design was further tested in a normal environment where energy from ambient water motions was harvested. The integrated water-TENG consisted of six strip shaped electrodes and a total of five basic units were formed by any pair of adjacent electrodes. The electric output of each pair was first rectified and then constructively superimposed through a parallel connection. It was then inserted into a traveling wave created by a large container, or placed beneath a sprinkler head with sprayed water droplets. The generated output current from both cases is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22g and h</a>, respectively. It is worth noting that the rectified current from water droplets (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22h</a>) showed almost continuous DC behavior, which was attributed to numerous droplets and the merging of the large number of current peaks.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition to the above two fundamental structural designs, a lot of other prototypes were also proposed for high performance blue energy harvesting. A dual-mode TENG was fabricated based on the superhydrophobic TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> layer and polymer thin films to collect both the electrostatic and mechanical energy from flowing water.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> The working of the hybrid water-TENG in this work relied on the coupling of contact-separation and single-electrode operation modes.

        <h3 id="sect1201"><span class="b_heading">7.2 TENGs for harvesting wind energy</span></h3>
        <span>Besides water wave energy, wind energy is also a type of widely existing power source from the natural environment. Investigations on wind energy harvesting also plays a key role to overcome the limits of existing technologies. In this regard, a flutter-driven TENG was developed for effective wind energy harvesting to sustainably drive electronic devices in outdoor environments. The structure of the TENG in this work was composed of a fluttering flexible flag and a rigid plate, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23a</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141</span></sup></a> The flag was a gold-coated conductive fabric that served as the fluttering body, and PTFE with a counter electrode was attached onto the rigid plate to form a contact-mode TENG. Natural wind would introduce the contact–separation behavior between the flag and the rigid plate to generate electricity, and thus it was important to understand the dynamic characteristics of flutters. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23b</a>, a flexible woven flag exhibited oscillations with a node. From the top to the node, the oscillation amplitude was very small, but it was subject to increase as a travelling wave propagated toward the trailing edge below the node. To bring up a self-sustained contact-propagation-separation between two triboelectric layers through high frequency flag fluttering, the counter plate was simply placed next to the flag flutter within a critical distance, and the coupled interaction between the two surfaces was systematically investigated by varying their dimensions. The stability boundary could be characterized by a regime map shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23c</a>, and two distinct contact-separation modes were observed in the plot. The transition from the single-contact mode in region A to the double-contact mode in region B occurred as the dimensionless mass decreased, which could be tuned by adjusting the length of the flag. Then, sequential images of the contact-propagation-separation behaviors for the single- and double-contact modes with different flag lengths were captured using a high-speed camera, and the details of the flag–plate interactions and transitions between different fluttering modes could be clearly identified. The flutter-driven TENG produced a high output of 200 V and 60 μA at a wind speed of 15 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, with an average power density of 0.86 mW. To demonstrate its wind energy harvesting capability in outdoor environments, a robust packaging module of the flutter-driven TENG was integrated (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23d</a>) and securely mounted onto the roof of a moving vehicle. The TENG was enabled to charge a 1000 μF capacitor to 30 V in 25 min when the vehicle was traveling at 70 km h<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23e</a>), thus demonstrating its operation in an open environment under various wind conditions. A rotary TENG was also developed to harvest wind energy assisted by the wind-driven rotation of cup vanes, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23f</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> The continuous shaft rotation introduced cyclic contact and consecutive sliding between Al foils and nanostructured PTFE film (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23g and h</a>). Hence, the working principle of this rotary TENG relied on coupling of vertical contact-separation and lateral sliding modes. With a wind speed of ∼15 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, its <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> and <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> were up to 250 V and 0.25 mA, respectively, corresponding to a maximum power density of ∼39 W m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Additionally, the rotary TENG could serve as a self-powered wind speed sensor (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23i and j</a>). As expected, <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>SC</sub></small> increased drastically with rising wind speeds; but <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>OC</sub></small> also showed slight elevation as the wind speed went up. This result could be explained by the change in the surface charge density. With higher wind speed, the polymer thin films would obtain higher rotational torque and thus a larger contacting force, which led to more intimate contact between two surfaces, resulting in a higher surface charge density. This invention may introduce a novel operation mechanism for wind generators and create a new development area of the wind power using nanostructured surfaces of conventional materials.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">TENG can be a high sensitive self-powered sensor for detecting mechanical triggering, stimulation and movement. The electric current and voltage signals generated by TENG represent the dynamic and static information, respectively, regarding a mechanical action. Such a sensor tip does not need a power to drive it, which is a major difference in comparison to conventional sensors. Applications can be found in areas of microelectromechanical systems, human–machine interfacing, touch-pad technology, security systems and motion sensing.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In recent years, TENGs have shown tremendous achievements in both fundamental understanding and technological improvements. As toward the future applications of TENGs, certain main issues and problems need to be addressed:</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(1) Understanding the fundamental mechanism of contact electrification. This phenomenon has been studied for a long time, and a few models have been established to explain the charge generation process, but no substantial conclusion has been reached. It will be of great importance to understand the charge transfer process to optimize the performance of TENGs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(2) Establishing a standard to calibrate the performance of a TENG. Four fundamental modes have been invented for TENGs, each of which has a specific design and choice of materials. Establishing standards for comparing and calibrating the performance of TENG is critical. Recently, Zi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> has established such criteria. As for materials, the surface charge density is a sole measure of the performance of TENGs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(3) Developing effective packaging technology for TENGs. The packaging of TENGs will be vitally important to make them commercialized products especially for application in a variety of hash environment, because moisture or any surface contaminants can largely affect the performance of the TENG. However, packaging of TENGs may be more difficult than that of traditional MEMS devices, since TENGs contain parts in motion and possible air gaps to separate surface charges.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(4) Find a suitable approach for power management. One advantage of the TENG is its high open-circuit voltage, while its short-circuit current is usually lower than that of solar cells or thermoelectric cells. It is targeted to harvest “random” and possibly low-frequency mechanical signals. As for such cases, the traditional transformer produces a huge loss in the power management. Hence, a power management approach is desirable to reduce its output voltage and boost its output current at the minimized power loss.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(5) Improving device durability and output stability. This is always a vital issue for the TENG especially in comparison to the traditional generator based on electromagnetic induction. New materials and coupled modes of operations would be good choices.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(6) Integrating the TENG with a sensor to form a self-powered system considering the practical environment in which the system will be employed.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">The TENG has the potential to be a new approach for harvesting ocean wave energy, although this is a long-term goal. It could be a revolutionary technology in comparison to the classical electromechanical generator with complementary areas of applications. We hope that the dream of blue energy could be realized in the near future, so that humans will have endless power supplied by nature.</p>
