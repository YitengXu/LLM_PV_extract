        <span class="bold">David O. Scanlon</span> opened a discussion of the paper by Mirjana Dimitrievska: Thank you for the very nice talk Mirjana! Zn and P on their own are toxic and earth abundant, but when together as Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small>, they make a very potent rat poison. Are you worried by the toxicity of Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> as an absorber?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> replied: This is a very interesting remark, that we actually hear quite often when we present our work on Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small>. While it is true that Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> is toxic when ingested (which is also the case for many other materials currently considered promising for PV), the layers that will be used in solar cells will be properly encapsulated, and should therefore not represent a danger to the environment. Additionally, Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> is also used as a fertiliser, and should therefore be recycled for this use after its end of life in solar cells. However, we still strongly advise you to not eat solar cells based on Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jens Wenzel Andreasen</span> commented: You report data that are stated to be grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, showing up to six diffraction orders, up to a 2-theta angle of about 50 degrees. This should not be possible for a monocrystalline film, as the crystal will be far off from Bragg conditions for the higher orders.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> responded: Thank you for your remark. This was an initial mistake in the paper, which was corrected in the proofs. Indeed, the XRD measurements are done in the <span class="italic">θ</span>–2<span class="italic">θ</span> configuration.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Xinwei Wang</span> said: In your paper (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00055E">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00055e</a>), you mentioned that the defect concentration was much larger than the carrier concentration and you attributed that to the neutral defects, could it also be due to the compensation of positively and negatively charged defects?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> replied: Thank you for your question. Yes, this indeed might be the case, as the calculated defect concentration based on the structural characterisation is of the order of 10<small><sup>21</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. This kind of estimation gives us a concentration of defects regardless of their charge. However, the reported charge carrier concentration for Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> is of the order of 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>16</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. This is why we think that some of the defects must be either neutral or charge compensated.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Sutton</span> commented: Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>3</sub></small> grown on orientated ZnO leads to no performance, while growth on randomly orientated ZnO leads to decent performance. This is due to the 1D Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub>3</sub></small> ribbons growing parallel to the substrate on the orientated ZnO giving poor charge transport. Zinc phosphide is not 1D, but do you think there could be a directionality effect at play, which is suppressed when amorphous?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> answered: Thank you for your question. This is definitely something that needs to be investigated. But looking just from the crystal structure perspective, it would make sense that there is some anisotropy present, and that the orientation of crystals will play some role in the performance of the final device.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Rafael Jaramillo</span> asked: Do you have PL comparing single crystal and polycrystalline films?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> responded: Yes, we do have PL spectra from monocrystalline and polycrystalline samples, which have been published in ref. 1. In this reference you can see that there are two peaks present in the PL of the monocrystalline sample, at about 1.52 and 1.3 eV, while there is only one peak at about 1.37 eV which could be directly attributed to Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the polycrystalline sample. The other peaks in the PL spectra of the polycrystalline sample correspond to the InP substrate. We have studied in detail the PL peaks from the monocrystalline sample,<small><sup>2</sup></small> and we can attribute the peak at 1.52 eV to the band to band transition, while the peak at 1.3 eV is related to defects. On the other hand, the origin of the peak at 1.37 eV is not yet completely clear to us, and we plan to investigate this further.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan J. S. Scragg</span> remarked: You mentioned that you had done DFT for your material (which you have made with a variety of off stoichiometric compositions). For which stoichiometry did you calculate?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> replied: Thank you for your question. All our DFT calculations to date are done on perfectly stoichiometric Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small>. In the future, we plan to expand these calculations to take into account the off-stoichiometry conditions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> asked: Have you checked the composition of single crystalline Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small>? Maybe the composition of Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> is different from the polycrystalline film? Single crystalline Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> is likely (very close to) stoichiometric and hence could be very insulating, which may explain why devices based on single crystals do not work.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> responded: Thank you for your question. Indeed, we have produced both stoichiometric and very off-stoichiometric Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> mono-crystalline samples as indicated in the paper (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00055E">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00055e</a>). We have made solar cells out of all of them, and none showed any promising device characteristics. On the other hand, almost all polycrystalline samples showed good device characteristics regardless of the composition. We think that the main issue is not in the stoichiometry of the monocrystalline samples at the moment, but rather something else. It might be related to the device structure itself, or even the sharp interface that happens at the back of the films.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn V. Sopiha</span> enquired: Do you think that the defects responsible for the off-stoichiometry are distributed randomly or form extended arrangements, similar to OVCs in CIGSe?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> replied: Thank you for your question. Our current results from various characterisation methods (XRD, Raman and TEM) indicate that there is no ordering in the defects, and that they are randomly distributed throughout the structure.</p>

        <span class="bold">Thomas P. Weiss</span> said: In addition to steady-state photoluminescence spectra, do you have time-resolved photoluminescence curves? The extracted lifetime would give additional information about the material quality, as the steady-state photoluminescence flux can be equally improved/increased by increasing the doping density or the minority carrier lifetime.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> answered: Thank you for your suggestion Thomas! Indeed, TRPL is something that we are working on at the moment, and will provide us with additional information on what is happening in our Zn<small><sub>3</sub></small>P<small><sub>2</sub></small> films.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Thomas P. Weiss</span> asked: Do you have an idea about the doping level in your phosphide films, as it has a strong impact on the photoluminescence flux? In other words: the higher the doping, the stronger the radiative recombination component.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> responded: We are currently doing conductivity and Hall measurements in order to estimate the carrier concentration in our films. From the literature, it is estimated that the carrier concentration in intrinsic films with off-stoichiometric compositions is around 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>16</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. However, we do not know yet if that is the case in our films. What we do observe from the PL measurements, as shown in our paper (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00055E">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00055e</a>), is that with an increase in defect concentration, the intensity of the defect-related PL peak increases, which signals higher recombination related to defects in general.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Thomas P. Weiss</span> enquired: Did you ever grow epitaxial films with varying thickness?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Would you assume that the bulk quality remains the same?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">From photoluminescence measurements on these films it would be possible to judge the surface recombination component.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In particular, if the epitaxial films have good carrier mobilities, the surface recombination lifetime can be very small.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> replied: Thank you for your question. While we did grow epitaxial films with different thicknesses, we have not yet systematically looked at the effect of thickness on the optoelectronic properties. This is definitely something that we will do in the future, in order to determine the surface recombination component.</p>

        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> opened a discussion of the paper by Joachim Breternitz: In my experience with ZnSnN, the bandgap always increased with more oxygen impurities.

To what extent do such correlations exist here, and what can we learn from this?</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> replied: Thank you very much for this question. Indeed, there have been reports on variation of the band gap with cation order/disorder in several nitride materials, including ZnGeN<small><sub>2</sub></small> (see for instance ref. 1). The major complication in most experimental studies is that oxygen cannot be completely eliminated and it does play a role in the order/disorder mechanism as well as in the optoelectronic properties, as we show in our work (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00041E">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00041e</a>). It must hence be taken into account in future work on such correlations. Furthermore, ZnGeN<small><sub>2</sub></small> has the disadvantage that Zn<small><sup>2+</sup></small> and Ge<small><sup>4+</sup></small> are isoelectronic and hence not reliably distinguishable from each other using X-ray diffraction. This prevents a similar analysis to that of Makin <span class="italic">et al.</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> Therefore, other techniques such as neutron diffraction need to be used in order to disentangle the contributions from oxygen incorporation and cation disorder reliably. Our work on this is currently underway. Ideally, this would offer not only one, but two ways of influencing the band gap energy of these materials.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> answered: Thank you very much for this suggestion. We have not performed such measurements yet. However, this is a very important point that should be followed through in the future.</p>

        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> enquired: Regarding the O contamination in your materials, can this actually be used to tune some of the optoelectronic parameters? Can you perhaps control the concentration of O?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> responded: Thank you for this great question. Since oxygen inclusion in nitride systems is easily achievable, it may be a very fruitful strategy to use its incorporation for effective bandgap control, as a change of the optical bandgap with oxygen content is evident. We have analysed the chemical reaction for the formation of Zn<small><sub>1+<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ge<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>(N<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>O<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small> in detail to understand the reaction mechanism and the synthesis conditions that are leading to defined compositions.<small><sup>1</sup></small> While our results so far concentrate on powders, an ammonolysis reaction on thin films would probably follow the same reaction mechanism and the parameters would only need to be modified accordingly.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan J. S. Scragg</span> remarked: I liked the positive spin that you put on the presence of disorder, which was described as a mechanism for tuning material properties. Unfortunately, generally speaking, disorder is a problem rather than an opportunity. It adds non-periodicity, and what follows is band gap fluctuations on a variety of possible length scales. The existence of disorder seems inevitable when we derive “new” materials by isoelectronic substitution and we introduce multiple elements with similar radii. In the case of kesterites, we went from CuInSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> to Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>ZnSnSe<small><sub>4</sub></small>, and we got Cu–Zn disorder. In your case, you went from a III–N to ZnGeN, and got Zn–Ge disorder. David B. Mitzi gave a different example (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00132B">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00132b</a>), where the Zn in kesterite was replaced by a much larger atom, Ba. The structure was changed, but the disorder was eliminated. Are there some examples of new nitrides with very different cation sizes that might have similar properties to those you want, but that would lack disorder?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> answered: I am not sure the relationship between increasing disorder and increased problems for solar cells necessarily holds true. Some of the highest performing halide perovskite formulations actually contain multiple cations and yet preserve high efficiencies.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Therefore, the question may need to be viewed for every specific materials system.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The case of Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaSnS<small><sub>4</sub></small> is actually very different from kesterites, since the structure changes entirely. While every atom is tetrahedrally coordinated in kesterites, Ba<small><sup>2+</sup></small> in Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaSnS<small><sub>4</sub></small> is 8-fold coordinated. This notable difference prevents disorder between this 8-fold coordinated Ba<small><sup>2+</sup></small> position and the tetrahedrally coordinated positions of Cu<small><sup>+</sup></small>. Such strong structural changes, however, also affect the electronic structure greatly, and direct assumptions about such compounds on the basis of the parent compounds are no longer viable. Such structural changes are observed in nitride materials, too. SrZrN<small><sub>2</sub></small>, for instance, crystallises in a layered structure in an α-NaFeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-type crystal structure;<small><sup>2</sup></small> note that this crystal structure is very different from the β-NaFeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-type crystal structure observed for ordered ZnGeN<small><sub>2</sub></small>, yet the same reservations for trying to rationalise properties on the basis of parent materials apply.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">All cations are tetrahedrally coordinated in ZnGeN<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which allows for disorder of the cations in this compound. The ionic radii (Zn<small><sup>2+</sup></small>: 0.55 Å, Ge<small><sup>4+</sup></small>: 0.39 Å (ref. 3)) are in fact considerably different from each other, and yet disorder is observed in these materials.

        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> answered: In fact, the way we produce our bulk powder samples is through ammonolysis, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> reaction of the oxide materials under ammonia atmosphere at elevated temperatures. The dissociation of ammonia at higher temperatures leads to a reductive atmosphere that contains reactive nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, which on the one hand form the oxide nitride materials through nitrogen incorporation into the solid and on the other hand remove oxygen from the material through reaction with hydrogen to water. We have spent a considerable amount of effort establishing the relationship between composition and reaction conditions for the bulk materials<small><sup>1</sup></small> – which shows that relatively strongly reducing conditions lead to the formation of oxygen-poor films. I would anticipate that, while the exact conditions may be slightly different for thin films, such reducing conditions would also be needed for the ammonolysis of thin films.</p>

It comes back to the measurement, and what is meant by “band gap”. How do you define and measure the band gap?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> answered: This is an important question for materials with variable degrees of disorder. Our work is mainly based on space averaging methods: diffraction for the crystal structures as well as diffuse reflectance UV-VIS spectroscopy for the optical band gap. When we refer to band gap from an experimental point-of-view, we refer to the optical band gap determined with the said method. Therefore, very small inhomogeneities may be challenging to spot, if they are evenly and randomly distributed. However, there is no indication from X-ray diffraction that would signify small coherent scattering domains – which would result from such inhomogeneities – and which would be expressed in strong peak broadening. Therefore, I would assume that the composition and crystal structure are largely homogeneous throughout the tested material without a smoking gun for separation.</p>

From an experimental point-of-view, we have never observed such a decomposition having studied the materials with space averaging techniques, such as powder diffraction and diffuse reflectance UV-VIS spectroscopy.

        <span class="bold">David O. Scanlon</span> asked: Is disorder always bad? It seems that certain types of disorder have been shown to improve material performance for example in AgBiS<small><sub>2</sub></small> devices, so perhaps we need to think about how we discuss the role of disorder?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Seán R. Kavanagh</span> answered: I agree. I think the classification of disorder as always bad is too black and white, and is inaccurate in many cases, exemplified by recent work on cation-disordered chalcogenides (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> AgBiS<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>1</sup></small>) and mixed-cation mixed-anion perovskites<small><sup>2</sup></small> as noted by Kostiantyn.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Whether disorder has a positive or negative effect on properties and performance seems to be a material-specific question, depending on the underlying bonding interactions and how disorder affects this. For instance, in the cation-disordered nitrides, kesterites and NaBiS<small><sub>2</sub></small> where we have site-swapping of heterovalent species, we see the formation of localised chalcogen <span class="italic">p</span> states above the VBM, which act as fast carrier traps and kill performance – as mentioned by Kostiantyn. This behaviour seems to be avoided in the mixed-cation mixed-anion perovskites (exhibiting homovalent disorder), but also to some extent in AgBiS<small><sub>2</sub></small> however, suggesting certain materials may exhibit a ‘disorder tolerance’, in which disorder could be a useful parameter to tune and optimise performance, but will harm performance in ‘disorder intolerant’ materials.</p>

        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn V. Sopiha</span> replied: It should be noted that CIGSe is disordered (In and Ga share the same sub-lattice). Halide perovskites are also disordered on different sublattices but perform well as solar absorbers nonetheless. These are good examples showing that disorder is not inherently detrimental. I think it is all material-specific. If complete randomness of site occupancies occurs between isovalent elements on the same sublattice, I see no reason why it should be harmful. The issues may arise when electrostatic potential perturbation emerges due to disorder, which can occur when ions with different valences are swapped.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Elisabetta Arca</span> commented: Following up on David’s question and as more of a comment, in this zinc compound, it seems to be bad, because band gap narrowing or opening is indicative of band edges moving and that is never good because it’s probably tail states, and in fact the actual performance of the solar cell is pretty poor. If we talk about other material systems that are more defect tolerant, that’s a different issue, but for this one it’s never good.</p>

        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> remarked: Jonathan J. S. Scragg raised a point querying examples where disorder has been beneficial. I would argue that alloys, for example (S,Se) as used in chalcopyrite and kesterite technologies, are one substantial example. The mixing of A-sites in perovskites would be another where homogeneous mixing provides tunability. However, I do recognise that these cases are distinct from site disorder in a stoichiometric crystal.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan J. S. Scragg</span> answered: Agreed, but if disorder is defined as a deviation from periodicity in the lattice, most alloys will be inherently disordered (presumably perfectly periodic arrangements of S or Se would be possible, but they are not likely). Thus alloying inescapably introduces disorder, but it is not the disorder itself that is beneficial. If it were possible to separate these effects, it might still be found that the disorder is detrimental in terms of having a contribution to band tails, lower mobility, <span class="italic">etc.</span></p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan J. S. Scragg</span> asked: Can the influence of disorder be decoupled from the effects of alloying? Will an alloy always bring with it some degree of band tailing, because of the lack of perfect periodicity?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> responded: This is an excellent question which would require some deep thinking to answer fully. I feel that you are correct in stating that some degree of band tailing is unavoidable. Even for a regular homogeneous solid-solution, the distribution of chemical environments will give rise to spatial fluctuations in the electronic structure.</p>

        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> remarked: One question that has continued to emerge in this discussion is whether “disorder is bad for PV materials”. As other participants have mentioned, the effects of disorder are very material-specific. A rule-of-thumb like this was likely developed with a few well-studied materials in mind (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> CZTS), and therefore should be used with caution especially when studying new materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">An additional point is that usually the phrase “PV materials” is interpreted to refer to absorbers, since they are the most heavily studied, however it is important to clarify that “PV materials” also include contacts, buffer layers, light-trapping layers, <span class="italic">etc.</span></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Disorder is indeed often very useful to attain useful properties in contact materials or buffer layers. For example, some of the best n-type transparent conductors are amorphous or highly disordered.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small> Another example is that in materials where conduction is dominated by polaron hopping, such as NiCo<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> spinels which have been proposed as transparent contact layers in photoelectrochemical cells, disorder has been shown to reduce the hopping barrier and actually lead to increased conductivity.<small><sup>3</sup></small> Therefore, whether disorder correlates with increased or decreased PV performance depends on the application, the specific material and its physics, and the type of disorder.</p>

        <span class="bold">Aron Walsh</span> addressed Joachim Breternitz: Traditionally, metal pnictides would have been overlooked for emerging PV applications due to the requirement for expensive growth techniques that avoid oxygen contamination.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> replied: It is certainly true that oxygen incorporation is traditionally considered unavoidable in the synthesis of nitrides in particular. This is due to the reaction inertness of N<small><sub>2</sub></small> as opposed to O<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<small><sup>1</sup></small> which means that at the highly energetic reaction conditions necessary for nitrogen activation (through temperature/plasma <span class="italic">etc.</span>), any traces of oxygen or water would react preferentially. Zakutayev <span class="italic">et al.</span> argue that the paradigm of pricey syntheses due to expensive techniques may be overcome through the combination of synthesis and theoretical calculations, which allow much more targeted synthesis efforts.<small><sup>2</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The experimental evidence for the impact of oxygen for solar cell devices needs to be established reliably, before a convincing conclusion should be drawn as to whether oxygen is killing performance. I would not feel confident assessing at this stage, whether oxygen really has such a detrimental effect, or whether a device would be able to perform well with oxygen incorporation. Oxygen clearly has an effect on the bandgap of the material, and hence if it is unavoidable during the synthesis, it needs to be taken into account at the point of materials characterisation and understanding and may even offer an effective way to tune the materials properties.</p>

There are already standards available, for example on how to measure <span class="italic">IV</span> curves properly, and how to measure an EQE curve taking into account mismatches between the device under testing and the reference. These standards are formed by a committee of international experts, and so the framework to facilitate making these protocols to get ‘good’ data is already there.

      <p class="otherpara">How significant is that finding of downward band bending considering that the photon energy (and thus depth) dependent photoemission measurements for each sample agree within the experimental uncertainty?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Smiles</span> replied: The presence of downward band bending at the GeSe surface is known qualitatively from the photoemission data (see Fig. 2(b) in the paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00048B">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00048b</a>) and the capacitance voltage (CV) results. The former enables us to determine the surface VBM to Fermi level separation, while the latter gives an estimate of the bulk VBM to Fermi level separation. An estimate of the quantitative degree of band bending is made by solving the Poisson equation using these VBM to Fermi level separation boundary conditions. We acknowledge that the two photoemission data points are not different to within the uncertainty specified. However, the bulk information from CV measurements means we are not reliant on the difference between the two photoemission data points.</p>

        <span class="bold">Charles J. Hages</span> opened a general discussion: I also support promoting the availability of raw data, particularly for emerging materials. It can be quite hard to trust the processed data or extracted parameters from analysis of data, as emerging materials are often very non-ideal. We have shown that even extracting basic data <span class="italic">IV</span> curves is not trivial for these emerging, often non-ideal materials. This also holds for capacitance, TRPL, <span class="italic">etc.</span> It is often important to reconsider or allow others to reanalyze the raw data, rather than having the processed parameters shared under FAIR. For example, we are currently reanalyzing TRPL data using a new method with raw data from a paper shared by Thomas Unold rather than just taking the extracted parameters from that paper. Also, it is easy to look back with a magnifying glass to the past to determine which parameters or information we should track and make available for future work. However, with emerging materials there may be new parameters or information we don’t realize is important now – having FAIR raw data would help alleviate this.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">

        <span class="bold">Susanne Siebentritt</span> remarked: Two comments on standardisation of measurements, in particular <span class="italic">jV</span> measurements:</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Firstly, the critical parameter is the area and it seems very difficult to get a correct measurement of it with a standard lab microscope. EQE is generally much more trustworthy than current density.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">When we send solar cells for certification, most of the time all parameters are confirmed – only our area is wrong.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Secondly, there is a reason why only 5 labs in the world can certify <span class="italic">jV</span> measurements. It is a huge effort to standardise the measurement so that it is absolute and certified. As researchers we simply don’t have the time for this effort. And for important samples, we can always send them to the certified labs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Thomas Unold</span> commented: I think in this I agree with Susanne that the first thing would be to record what we are doing and, if there needs to be some standardization at some point, maybe we need it but the first thing will be recording all the metadata, that’s the important thing. So we can very often look at what has been happening in the halide perovskites – I think it’s very interesting. They had very big differences in measuring <span class="italic">JV</span>, some were measuring reverse and some forward, and with reverse measurements you get much higher efficiencies, but it wasn’t recorded, so it was a big mess for at least 1–2 years, and they had to standardise this in a way. There might be cases where we have to do this, but in other cases, in the beginning to record what we are doing and making the data available and the metadata available is a very good first step.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jake W.

As far as I know it is not possible to measure this parameter using standard impedance spectroscopy measurements. It is necessary to use IMPS (intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy). This should be clarified in the paper (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D1FD00056J">https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fd00056j</a>) if you have employed another technique to measure carrier life time.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> replied: I agree with you.

However, the EQEs are nearly identical, suggesting no improvement in the current collection near the back surface. So the voltage implies less recombination at the back, but the current collection is not getting better at the back. Could you please comment on this?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> responded: Given the noticeable sloping in the long wavelength region (650–850 nm) of the EQE, we seem to have a carrier collection problem presumably due to either a short carrier lifetime or low carrier mobility. Despite the suppression of the back-surface recombination (hence the improved <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small>), <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small> seems to be dominated by the poor collection through the thickness of the absorber, hence, similar EQEs for both cases resulted.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Phillip J. Dale</span> commented: As a follow up question, the “PAT + poly-TPD” sample shows a better current collection at long wavelengths, implying better collection from deeper within the sample. However, the open circuit voltage of the “PAT + poly-TPD” is nearly identical to that of the “PAT” sample. Does this imply that something else is limiting the <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small>, rather than back surface recombination?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> replied: I think the back-surface passivation was more or less taken care of by PAT alone. The role of the additional poly-TPD must be the reflection of incident light (hence the absorption of a larger number of photons near the back surface) and/or the reflection of electrons from the Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>/poly-TPD interface.</p>

You showed a quite high device efficiency with CdS and using an additional selenization processing step. Can you comment on the issue of intermixing and how to control and avoid it?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> responded: We have not exclusively investigated the interfacial mixing between Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> and CdS. Considering the deposition temperature of 300 °C (and PAT temperature of 100 °C which is negligible compared to the growth temperature), some degree of mixing is expected. In CIGS, interdiffusion of Cd between CIGS and the CdS buffer is known to be beneficial by converting the top surface of p-type CIGS into n-type and moving the p–n junction away from the metallurgical CIGS/CdS interface. A similar mechanism may operate in the case of Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> too.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nicolae Spalatu</span> commented: A 300 °C deposition/annealing temperature is quite high. A current of 30 mA is very impressive for Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> in combination with a CdS buffer layer. Could you comment on such a large value of the current density for the device with CdS, having a band gap of 2.5 eV and parasitic absorption at 350–400 nm wavelength?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> answered: We found that the key to high <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small> in Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> solar cells was the proper crystallographic alignment of the absorber along the [<span class="italic">hk</span>1] direction. The parasitic absorption by the CdS is reflected in low EQEs (∼50%) between 400 and 500 nm, which we believe accounts for the loss of <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small> of 2 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> maximum.</p>

        <span class="bold">Marcus Bär</span> asked: What is the ion energy you use for your depth profiling when sputtering through the sample? Are you not afraid of sputter-induced artefacts?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> replied: We used an Ar ion beam at 2 keV. Given that almost identical spectra were obtained from the “After PAT” sample during the depth profiling (Fig. 2b and d in our paper, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D1FD00056J">https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fd00056j</a>), we believe any sputter-induced artifacts were minimal.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan D. Major</span> remarked: Following on from Phillip J. Dale’s question – there seems to be a degree of overlap between the poly-TPD approach and the PAT effect. There is a similar increase for addition of the TPD to with the PAT. Did you introduce poly-TPD for a device that was not PAT to separate the effects?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> responded: This is a good suggestion. Unfortunately we have not examined the case where only poly-TPD was applied without PAT. However, we tried other HTL materials (PTAA, spiro, PEDOT:PSS and TFB) without PAT. Compared to the reference (without any HTL and without PAT) they all improved <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small> and all except TFB improved <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small>. Therefore, we could conclude that there is a substantial overlap in the back-surface passivation by the PAT and an HTL.</p>

Firstly, are they inside the bulk or at the interface? Secondly, some papers also reported that the formation of a thin Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> layer under Sb-rich conditions benefits the efficiency because it may passivate the interfacial defects. But you also mentioned in your paper there will be more detrimental bulk defects under Se-rich conditions. Does this mean the harmful effects of bulk defects and interfacial defects cannot be alleviated at the same time?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> replied: From XPS depth-profiling, we confirmed that antimony oxide resides on the surface. Even for an Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> film treated with post-deposition Se annealing (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, detrimental V<small><sub>Se</sub></small> residing in the bulk taken care of), there is a thin layer of Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> even though it is thinner than the oxide layer on Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> with no post-deposition Se treatment.

However, the X-ray cross-section at the low BE part is small and therefore the signal is noisy. We are better off using UPS for this. We haven’t measured UPS yet but plan to do so in the near future.</p>

        <span class="bold">David J. Fermin</span> opened a discussion of the paper by Nicolae Spalatu: It is rather surprising to see changes in lattice parameters as a result of the removal of residual organic impurities in titania. On the other hand, vacuum annealing will promote oxygen vacancies which can affect the lattice constant, perhaps under rather extreme conditions. Can you elaborate on why you link structural changes to organic residues rather than structural defects?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Nicolae Spalatu</span> responded: The changes in the lattice parameters of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can occur as a result of both the removal of residual impurities, and the generation of oxygen vacancies under vacuum annealing conditions. We linked the structural changes to organic residues as the mobility of these residuals is very intensive at both low–moderate and at higher vacuum and air annealing temperatures.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, within the same process, the carbon impurity incorporates into the lattice and probably also accumulates at the grain boundaries of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, as suggested by the results of XPS analysis.

As a way to quantify the crystallographic orientation we use the ratio of peak intensity of (221) to (120). When this value is above 10 we get a good photocurrent.

        <span class="bold">Nicolae Spalatu</span> asked: What could be a suitable characterization method to study more thoroughly the solar cell device interface and recombination at the interface (to quantify the recombination rates at the interfaces)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devendra Tiwari</span> replied: If this is a general question regarding PV device characterisation, then this is quite a loaded one, deserving volumes of handbooks indeed. To begin with, what sort of materials and device structure are we talking about – small-molecule or polymeric organic bulk heterostructure, or inorganic junctions? For the context of this meeting, I am assuming and constraining to the latter. Even then, defining the interface depends on a few different pieces of information such as the actual set of materials – composition and morphology, device architecture, junction type and ideality of the interfacial chemistry (or its resemblance to respective bulk characters) which would restrict the set of techniques and models to analyse the data that could be implemented. More importantly, the most non-trivial part is tunability of the probe and the setup to distinguish and separate the transport dominant at interface from that in the bulk.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Typically, in (opto)electronic measurements, one could either use light or potential bias, guided by the chemical and structural characterisation, to probe across the thickness of the device and/or the electrical junctions. Lastly, the most accessible techniques and most commonly employed degree of analysis tell us about the energetic positions, abundance of recombination sites and, in occasional cases, if we have enough information, defect cross-section as well. Since the overall power conversion efficiency is a steady-state feature, the knowledge and direct measurement of the recombination kinetics become inconsequential in most cases or are inferable from the drift–diffusion equations, as typically most device modelling implementations do in the backend. The most direct measurement of transport parameters related to interfacial recombination is, perhaps, through a dynamic measurement of quasi-Fermi levels and carrier recombination velocities – which is challenging to do, to say the least, and perhaps would be more doable for well-defined surfaces (and not complex interfaces) as has been demonstrated in a few limited cases.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">However, I will mention a few techniques, familiar to me, which come close to this though none would be straightforward to analyse and generalise to characterisation of PV devices.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(i) Absolute photoluminescence (PL) measurement or PL quantum yield if the excitation is tuned to be interactable only within the interfacial region and most of the depletion occurs on one side of the junction (absorber). Then, the yield and peak width can be used to model the recombination kinetics. (ii) From the attempt-to-escape frequency term (or its analogues) appearing in models used for capacitance-based (or other) techniques convoluted in the pre-exponential factor. Techniques such as temperature-dependent admittance or deep-level transient spectroscopy are worth mentioning in this case. The latter being informationally more comprehensive but more difficult to analyse. (iii) Time-of-flight methods, transient photovoltage, charge-extraction and allied methods including IMPS and IMVS, the analysis of which requires complementation from other semiconductor transport measurements and/or specific sample preparation. Of course, the caveats are (a) as the number of parameters to be deduced in the model increases, one would have to include more physical variants such as temperature and/or intensity <span class="italic">etc</span>., (b) precise and independent knowledge of other fundamental semiconductor parameters, including density of state near band-edges, (c) applicability of the particular technique and setup to probe the required lifetimes, and (d) most restrictively, a careful sample preparation well suited for clean measurement and analysis. In particular, the last often forbids conducting and analysing such measurements for low performing, albeit most interesting, devices of emerging materials where little is known to enable such detailed analysis. Further, as an aside it’s important to note here that the composition, bonding and electronic structures at surfaces especially for (non-textbook) compound semiconductors can vary significantly from the bulk and therefore most optoelectronic, chemical and semiconductor transport parameters will be significantly different as well. Added on to that is the complexity endowed by the polycrystalline nature of the materials, as is preferable for use in large scale deployable applications. This will have knock-on effects on a universe of information taken as the same as the bulk, most influentially charge–phonon coupling.Finally, as a material scientist and perhaps as alluded to by Dr Spalatu, knowing the thermodynamics and kinetics of carrier recombination is not of much help without the related chemical information, which then can be used to rationally modify materials and devices for better performance. The simultaneous or correlatable determination of chemical information and carrier-transport and validity of such methodology would be a whole different story.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">So, in the end, the dynamic and multi-faceted distinguishable characterisation of the interface and bulk carrier transport for optoelectronic devices is the next frontier indeed. For now, the applicability and relevance of a measurement technique for ascertaining the interfacial recombination will, therefore, be on a case-by-case basis and more so than as prevalently assumed for the bulk.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">To estimate the concentration of point defects in Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>, we conducted low-temperature PL at <span class="italic">T</span> = 10 K. We examined two samples, Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> films grown without Se and with 40 mg Se. In both cases, there is a peak at 1.31 eV, which is labelled as P2. The room-temperature bandgap of Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>, derived from the EQE, is ∼1.16 eV. Considering the temperature dependence of the bandgap of Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>, we attribute the PL peak at 1.31 eV at 10 K to the band-to-band recombination. Additionally, there is another peak at ∼1.22 eV (labelled P1), which must originate from recombination through traps, either 0.09 eV below the conduction band edge or 0.09 eV above the valence band edge. Based on theoretical studies in the literature, the traps giving rise to P1 are shallow acceptor-like defects, Sb vacancies (V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small>). The relative ratio of P1/P2 allows us to estimate the relative population of V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small> between the two samples (no Se <span class="italic">vs.</span> 40 mg Se). Another piece of information learned from the previous theoretical studies is the difference in the formation energy of various point defects, from which we could also determine the ratio of their equilibrium concentrations. In Se-poor conditions (relevant for the no Se sample), the formation energy of V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small> in weakly p-type Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>, which is the case for our Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> films as confirmed by UPS, was reported to be similar to that of V<small><sub>Se</sub></small>; therefore, their equilibrium concentrations must be very similar, too. On the other hand, in Se-rich conditions (relevant for the 40 mg Se sample), the formation energy of V<small><sub>Se</sub></small> is substantially larger than that of V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small> by 1.2 eV. With this large difference in the formation energies, the estimated ratio of the equilibrium concentration of V<small><sub>Se</sub></small> to that of V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small> is almost 1 × 10<small><sup>−13</sup></small>; therefore, the concentration of V<small><sub>Se</sub></small> in an Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> film prepared under Se-rich conditions as for the 40 mg Se sample is negligible compared to V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small>. From the PL measurements of the two samples (no Se <span class="italic">vs.</span> 40 mg Se), the ratio of P1/P2 is smaller in the case of 40 mg Se suggesting that the concentration of V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small> is also smaller. Now considering the estimated ratio of the concentration of V<small><sub>Se</sub></small> to that of V<small><sub>Sb</sub></small> is 1 × 10<small><sup>−13</sup></small> in the 40 mg Se sample, while the ratio must be close to 1 in the no Se sample, it is fair to conclude that the concentration of V<small><sub>Se</sub></small> in the 40 mg Se sample is much smaller than that in the no Se sample by more than 10 orders of magnitude – to an almost negligible level.</p>

        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> replied: At least for Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small>, we saw indirect but clear evidence that point defects such as <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>Se</sub></small> strongly influence <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small>. It is possible that both self-trapping and intrinsic defects matter.</p>

        <span class="bold">Prakriti Kayastha</span> communicated: There have been several discussions during the conference about how oxygen bonding is fundamentally very different to S or Se bonding. In Fig. 3 of your work (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D1FD00056J">https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fd00056j</a>), both Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> seem to have very similar vibrational behaviour, except for the green ‘A<small><sub>g</sub></small>’ band. Could you comment?</p>

        <span class="bold">Byungha Shin</span> communicated in reply: You are right about the vibrational spectra of Sb–O and Sb–Se bonding. In Fig. 3 of the paper (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D1FD00056J">https://doi.org/10.1039/d1fd00056j</a>), both samples are Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> (with a thin layer of Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> on top). The green line at ∼255 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> represents the A<small><sub>g</sub></small> band of the oxide, which is present in both samples because there is a surface oxide layer on both samples, although the intensity is weaker for the PAT sample, consistent with XPS results. The peaks at ∼115 and ∼190 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> represent the A<small><sub>g</sub></small> bands of the selenide, which are different from the A<small><sub>g</sub></small> band of the oxide.</p>
