One representative group is the family of rechargeable liquid metal batteries, which were initially exploited with a view to implementing intermittent energy sources due to their specific benefits including their ultrafast electrode charge-transfer kinetics and their ability to resist microstructural electrode degradation. Although conventional liquid metal batteries require high temperatures to liquify electrodes, and maintain the high conductivity of molten salt electrolytes, the degrees of electrochemical irreversibility induced by their corrosive active components emerged as a drawback. In addition, safety issues caused by the complexity of parasitic chemical reactivities at high temperatures further complicated their practical applications. To address these challenges, new paradigms for liquid metal batteries operated at room or intermediate temperatures are explored to circumvent the thermal management problems, corrosive reactions, and challenges related to hermetic sealing, by applying alternative electrodes, manipulating the underlying electrochemical behavior <span class="italic">via</span> electrolyte design concepts, and engineering the electrode–electrolyte interfaces, thereby enabling both conventional and completely new functionalities. This report briefly summarizes previous research on liquid metal batteries and, in particular, highlights our fresh understanding of the electrochemistry of liquid metal batteries that have arisen from researchers’ efforts, along with discovered hurdles that have been realized in reformulated cells. Finally, the feasibility of new liquid metal batteries is discussed along with their distinct chemistries and performance characteristics to answer the question of how liquid metals can be accessible for next-generation battery systems.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2021/EE/d1ee00531f/d1ee00531f-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: d1ee00531f-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2021/EE/d1ee00531f/d1ee00531f-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

          <span>The need for higher energy-density rechargeable batteries invokes interest in metal electrodes. Most solid metal anodes, however, suffer from the risk of dendrite growth, which raises safety concerns and impedes further security-critical applications. Among the available battery chemistries to solve this problem, the liquid metal electrode chemistry, in some aspects, is one of the most promising chemistries. This is dominantly attributed to the unique liquid–liquid electrode–electrolyte interface, which could allow liquid metal batteries to operate without solid dendrite growth and to obtain relatively high round-trip efficiencies at high current densities. However, practical liquid metal batteries can only be successfully developed after current hurdles are properly addressed. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances in the development of liquid metal batteries and, in particular, provide our understanding of the electrochemistry of liquid metal batteries, along with discovered problematic issues that have been realized from researchers’ efforts. This work will promote the fundamental understanding of LMBs for practical applications and serve as a comprehensive guide for further liquid metal electrode research.</span>

      <span>The increasing demand for a low-carbon footprint economy has triggered significant changes in global energy consumption, driving us towards an imminent transition from hydrocarbon fuels to renewable and sustainable energy technologies.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–4</span></sup></a> Electrochemical energy storage systems, such as batteries, are critical for enabling sustainable yet intermittent energy harvesting from sources including solar, wind, and geothermal.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> To date, various battery technologies have been employed for rapid and efficient energy storage/release, especially the prevailing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which fulfilled their promise for portable electronic devices and are being established in other niche markets such as stationary units and electric vehicles. The global market is projected to hit A$200 billion by 2027,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> however, the cell-level energy density and pack-level costs of practical systems come short of the corresponding expectations with characteristics in the order of 350 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 750 W h L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and &lt;A$170 kW h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">The need for better rechargeable batteries to enable high energy densities (around 500 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) with low cost has motivated researchers to replace the current metal ion batteries over the past few decades.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,7</span></sup></a> The transition to metal-electrode-based battery chemistries, which have been known since the 1970s, can significantly enhance the figures of merit of batteries, and one of the possible alternatives such as Li metal anodes featuring a high specific capacity (3860 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and electropositive potential (−3.04 V <span class="italic">vs.</span> standard hydrogen electrode, SHE).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> Unfortunately, most solid metal anodes, such as Zn and Li metal anodes, suffer from the possibility/risk of dendrite growth, which induces safety incidents and impedes security-critical applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> Consequently, finding alternatives with high-energy densities, cost-effectiveness, and good safety features is still an important part of metal-based battery research. This realization led to interest in liquid-to-liquid-based electrochemistry to gradually substitute for solid-to-solid chemistries. There is significant competitiveness for liquid systems beyond solid-state systems in terms of (i) the capability to operate with relatively high voltage efficiencies at high rates due to the superior kinetics provided by the liquid–liquid interfaces; (ii) the ability of liquid electrodes to render themselves immune to microstructural electrode deformation and/or dendrite formation; (iii) the advantage of establishing flexible energy storage components; and (iv) the eventual potential of reduced cost because most of the active materials are earth-abundant and inexpensive.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10–14</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The inspiration for liquid metal batteries (LMBs) can be traced back to the electrowinning of Al in 1886 and have long been under investigation (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1a</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> Early explorations (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Cu–Al Hoopes cell) focused on systems that required high temperatures (HTLMBs, &gt;400 °C), but comparatively low equilibrium cell voltages (below 30 mV). Specifically, such HTLMBs generally consisted of a molten salt (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> halide) electrolyte, where high-melting-point liquid metals (LMs) as electrodes were self-segregated and featured mutual immiscibility. Metals with intermediate melting points were also incorporated in LMBs to decrease the operating temperature, notably molten Li in the Li–SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> battery, yet they afforded limited reversibility.

A typical example applying Mg–Ca alloy was recently reported, where Ca also served as the active component due to its lower electronegativity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Here, a Ca–Mg (90<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>10, mol%) negative electrode coupled with bismuth in LiCl–CaCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> electrolyte was able to provide a 99% coulombic efficiency along with good cycling to operate at temperatures below 550 °C,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> supporting the effectiveness of this strategy. It was shown that a Ca–Mg alloy in the high-Ca eutectic region (0.60 &lt; <span class="italic">x</span><small><sub>Ca</sub></small> &lt; 0.80) would decrease the whole voltage by less than 30 mV compared with pristine Ca. Further decreasing the Ca concentration in the Ca–Mg alloy resulted in an obvious voltage loss of 200 mV; however, the reduction of the Ca concentration in the molten salt could radically improve the electrochemical performance in terms of cyclability.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Eutectic alloys not only have shown promise in decreasing the melting points in comparison to the individual metallic components in negative electrodes, but also hold the potential for dramatically reducing the melting points of positive electrodes. Bismuth is a promising material for constructing such alloys owing to its low melting point of around 271 °C. One typical Li|LiCl–LiF (30<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>70, mol%)|Bi system was found to operate at 550 °C with a good rate capability (1000 cycles at 300 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> with only 0.004% fade per cycle).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, the high Li concentration still caused polarization in Bi at high rates (1250 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>), resulting in a discharge voltage in Li‖Bi of only 0.525 V, which was below its theoretical value for discharge with the OCV ranging from 0.95 to 0.72 V (from liquid Bi to solid-phase Li<small><sub>3</sub></small>Bi).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> In this condition, the polarization is mainly caused by the formation of solid Li<small><sub>3</sub></small>Bi on the positive electrode side, which features a high melting point and also offers a density that is in between those of the electrolyte and the electrode. However, the reaction kinetics and charge transfer are gradually retarded by the increased thickness of this solid layer relative to the depth of discharge. Thus, a prospective strategy to decrease the polarization voltage is to look for alloys that can change the discharge product. Recently, an optimized electrode containing Bi–Ga alloy (70<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>30, mol%) was proposed, where a Ga-rich discharge product (Li–Bi–Ga melt) was formed and coexisted in the liquid phase with the solid Li<small><sub>3</sub></small>Bi in the same layer to build rapid transfer kinetics. Gallium was selected due to its lower melting point (29.8 °C) than and comparable density (5.79 g cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>, 500 °C) to Li<small><sub>3</sub></small>Bi.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> Here, the operational temperature of the whole cell was decreased to 500 °C. Owing to the synergetic combination of these advantages, the as-designed Li|LiF–LiCl–LiBr|Bi–Ga system delivered a high discharge voltage of 0.54 V at 1200 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, which was 1.75 times higher than that of its Li‖Bi counterpart.

Furthermore, no obvious corrosion on the current collectors or sheath could be found from the cross-sectional investigations after 1800 hours of operation. From a practical perspective, this system could reach a capacity of 62.0 Ah at 275 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, and the nominal discharge voltage was measured to be 0.69 V at 500 °C with an estimated cost of A$100 kW h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

          <span>Molten halides are in widespread use as electrolytes in HTLMBs due to their superior ionic conductivity (up to 3 S cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), potential cost-effectiveness, and better safety in comparison to commonly used liquid electrolytes. Molten salt electrolytes can also provide ultrafast electrode charge-transfer kinetics due to liquid–liquid electrode–electrolyte interfaces compared to emerging solid-state electrolytes. For molten halides, the appropriate candidates should meet the well-established selection criteria, which are as follows: (i) they should have a low melting point; (ii) they should be strong ionic conductors and electron insulators; (iii) they should have appropriate density; and (iv) they should not show parasitic reactions with electrodes. Nevertheless, the generation of subvalent ions caused by severe metallic solubility in the molten electrolyte is inevitable at high temperature. Although such a parasitic reaction improves the whole ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, a severe self-discharge rate along with a dramatically decreased energy efficiency becomes an obstacle to sustaining the reversibility. Luckily, despite the fact that experimental studies regarding electrolyte modification have rarely been undertaken other than for the developments of alloy LMs, it is currently believed that the maximum metal solubility only occurs in molten halides containing the cation of their respective metal. Previous investigations also indicated that the solubilities of LMs in their own halide salts are mainly related to the atomic number and are generally enhanced with increasing atomic number (Li &lt; Na &lt; K &lt; Rb &lt; Cs and F &lt; Cl &lt; Br &lt; I), as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3a</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41–45</span></sup></a> Notably, it is expected that the solubility of liquid metals in molten salt electrolytes can be suppressed by alloying the liquid metal to decrease its activity.

For instance, it was found that molten Li reacts with the K<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions in LiCl–KCl molten electrolyte (Li + KCl = LiCl + K) to form liquid K, which can be rapidly evaporated if the system operating temperature exceeds the boiling point of K (760 °C).

          <span>Generally, external heaters are required to liquefy materials in visible HTLMB chemistries, but external heaters are not always necessary because the electrical resistance of the battery components converts electrical energy to heat in a process known as Joule or ohmic heating. This Joule heating essentially occurs in the electrolyte because its electrical conductivity is four orders of magnitude smaller than those of liquid metals. If the environmental heat loss is neglected and the battery operates at a high enough current density, such a battery can maintain its high temperature without additional heaters, and the primary heat source would be the HTLMB itself.

          <span>Portable devices require both energy and power densities, and these requirements are also needed for grid-scale markets. Clearly, the energy density is determined by several factors including the electrode couple, the efficiency of M<small><sup>+</sup></small> conduction in electrolyte, and the transference kinetics between the electrodes and electrolyte. As can be seen from <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1d</a>, the energy densities of previously discussed energy storage systems involving HTLMBs always lie below 200 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. These values would be dramatically decreased when decreasing their more elevated operational temperatures to intermediate zones. To fulfil the high demand for energy-related applications, efforts have increasingly been shifted toward higher-energy-density HTLMBs (&gt;200 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) in recent years, especially those operating at high current densities but at low temperatures.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">One of the interesting models is a high temperature Na–S cell, which has a high theoretical gravimetric energy density of 750 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, although the practical value remains below 250 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This is to avoid the formation of insoluble shorter chain polysulfides (Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>S<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>, <span class="italic">x</span> &lt; 3) at 350 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> In order to improve the energy density, implementing novel electrolytes (such as ionic liquids) in this system is a plausible method. The chemistry of the ionic liquids with polysulfides and the related economic feasibility, however, still correspond to significant technical and economic challenges. In addition, while tubular type cells are dominant models in the current market, a possible exchange for planar configurations should be considered for the stacking of the electrodes based on Na–S cells. The enhanced active surface area for a given cell volume or the introduction of thinner electrodes can lead to higher capability and energy density. Alternatively, the family of liquid metal–gas systems show conceptual possibilities in terms of high energy densities but low costs by employing ultralight-weight air cathodes. As a proof of concept, Licht <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed a prototype consisting of a C, Fe or VB<small><sub>2</sub></small> negative electrode coupled with an air positive electrode in molten electrolyte with its intrinsic energy density ranging from 10<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 to 27<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 W h L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 700 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> Even so, this kind of cell still cannot provide long-term cycling stability due to the lack of effective catalysts. To this end, Baek <span class="italic">et al.</span> recently reported a highly reversible Li–CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> cell at 150 °C, which was achieved by using a nitrate-based quinary molten salt as electrolyte and ruthenium nanoparticles (catalysts) on the carbon cathode.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57</span></sup></a> Interestingly, unlike lithium halides, nitrate and nitrite anions can simultaneously lower the melting temperature of molten salts and provide sufficient ionic conductivity in a specific working window (below ∼4.0 V). Also, both simulations and experimental results have so far demonstrated intriguing decomposition mechanisms for the discharge product Li<small><sub>2</sub></small>CO<small><sub>3</sub></small> in nitrate-based molten salts. Therefore, a stable cycling performance of more than 300 cycles at 10 A g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with the highest peak power density of 33.4 mW cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> (where the input power required to maintain 150 °C was only ∼0.6 mW) was obtained. Notably, high charging voltages and poor electrochemical reversibility, when cycling at high depths of discharge (rather than capacity-limited operation, which is often used in metal–gas systems), should be further improved when considering its practical use. Another metal–gas example involving a Li negative electrode, a eutectic LiNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>−KNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> electrolyte, oxygen, and a carbon cathode was proposed in 2016 by Giordani and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit58"><sup><span class="sup_ref">58</span></sup></a> When it was operated at 150 °C, improved energy efficiency (∼95%) and rate capability were achieved.

Notably, even under conditions of violent vibrations and impact, the Ta doped LLZO tube still remained intact without any noticeable cracks or damage, indicating that the tube exhibited good mechanical properties. This design offered prospects for grid-scale energy storage with high energy density, high safety, and low maintenance costs.

            <span>The interfacial wettability between electrodes and electrolytes, as well as between the electrodes and substrates (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, the current collector), primarily determines the resistance and transfer kinetics of batteries, which has been a dominant research aspect of surface chemistry in practical storage systems. Firstly, for wettability between LMs and substrates, both the surface tension and viscosity should be reduced to a lower degree at higher temperatures, resulting in a good wetting behavior regardless of the dimensions of the liquid metals. At room temperature, the high surface tension of pristine Ga LM supports its natural tendency to form spherical droplets that minimize surface energy, providing the worst wettability towards other surfaces, not only to liquid electrolytes but also to solid substrates (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> This is problematic during the fabrication of electrodes involving pristine Ga LM. Secondly, the high surface tension of Ga LM makes it a suitable component for constructing alloy-type self-healing anodes, where materials such as Si and Sn are mainly active components, which suffer from the enormous volume change caused by diffusion-induced stresses during the lithiation process.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70,71</span></sup></a> It is difficult to obtain homogeneous components from routine mixtures of these materials without any additives (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> organic molecules) during electrode preparation due to the inferior wettability of Ga LM. Thirdly, increasing the surface area-to-volume ratio of the electrode is vital for electrochemical performance (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> while reducing the size of bulk Ga LM to nanoscale dimensions is difficult due to its high surface tension. In addition, not only do self-healing electrodes containing LMs need to retain good wetting behavior within themselves, but the electrodes and other components, such as conductive carbon and binder species, also need to maintain contacts strong enough to offer a linked conductive network and ionic tunnels. Therefore, care should be taken when selecting appropriate components during the electrode preparation. For instance, it is generally believed that gallium based LMs adhere in the form of thin films to some hydrophilic species, while they do not adhere to certain hydrophobic surfaces, and aqueous binders may be thus essential for preparing electrode slurries.</span>

            <span>The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a vital role in the performance of LIBs. Ideally, the SEI serves as a passivation layer and is Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion conducting but electrically insulating, allowing Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions to effectively transfer across the electrode while preventing the further electrolyte reduction at the anode surface.

            <p class="otherpara">In general, when LIBs are employed with a graphite anode (with limited volume change) and ethylene carbonate (essential constituent), an SEI layer with 30 nm thickness that includes organic/inorganic compounds is formed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, the stability of this SEI layer is also limited, and the layer slowly fractures and reforms, thus eventually leading to loss of the electrolyte. Based on early explorations of LIBs, when the SEI layer (a liquid–electrolyte interface due to the liquid feature of Ga) is formed on the Ga LM surface, the breakage and reformation of the SEI layer are accelerated. Firstly, the extreme volume change of the Ga LM during repeated cycling processes leads to its extensive fracturing and pulverization, which provokes interfacial fluctuations on the Ga surface, followed by damage to the initially formed SEI layer. The exposed surface of the Ga LM further consumes the electrolyte to form a new SEI.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8,76</span></sup></a> Secondly, the formation of solid Li<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ga (due to the typical phase transition of the Ga LM) would result in the separation of the previously formed SEI layer from the surface of liquid Ga. This phase change is believed to be related to the inhomogeneous coverage of the SEI film. Thirdly, though great efforts have been made towards self-healing Ga LM, we still have very little idea of just what the exact process of self-healing is at the inner electrode. When regarded as a self-healing electrode, however, the old SEI layer on the Ga LM cannot fully cover the newly generated surface of the self-healing Ga LM due to the structural deformation (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5a</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> During the reversible Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> intercalation into and extraction from liquid Ga, we know very less at the molecular level about the SEI films on the liquid surface – even how a well-functioning SEI works.</p>

(a) Illustration of the principal failure reasons of Ga based LIBs when coupled with a high voltage cathode. At the anode, the organic ligands are required to disperse the Ga LM to obtain a sheet-like electrode. Non-uniform Ga distribution is achieved even by applying various mechanical approaches. During cycling, some Ga LM partially self-healed due to their strong surface tensions, while some others could be isolated by the binder or the formed SEI layer. Some active Ga LM would undergo a huge volume change, leaving a fractured structure after cycling. Moreover, electrolyte consumption can be attributed to the continuous SEI formation. At the cathode, a cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is formed by the decomposition of electrolytes. The problem of decomposition of cathode materials under high voltages should be avoided. (b) At the anode, only a limited amount of NaK alloy can be adsorbed by carbon substrates. The risk of squeezing out of the NaK alloy during battery operation cycles due to the over-dose can induce the anode crossover to the cathode during assembly.

            <p class="otherpara">In addition, not only can Ga based LMs be corroded by organic-based electrolytes to form an SEI layer, but the SEI layer can also be formed when in contact with aqueous electrolytes.

            <span>Owing to the highly negative electrochemical potentials of K<small><sup>+</sup></small>/K and Na<small><sup>+</sup></small>/Na, virtually any liquid electrolyte can be reduced at the surface of NaK; this process accelerated when carbon substrates were used as matrices due to the improvement of the contact area. Before the NaK anode can become a viable electrode, formidable challenges need to be overcome, and one of the greatest challenges is the lack of any full understanding of the SEI layer since only a few reports were focused on this topic. A perfect SEI layer on the NaK surface is expected to be stable and homogeneous in composition and morphology; have acceptable ionic conductivity and electron-blocking capability; and exhibit strong mechanical performance. Yet many of them cannot be achieved in laboratory experiments or partly contradict the experimental results. Accordingly, the following problems regarding the SEI layer for NaK anodes are worth noting: (i) owing to the highly negative electrochemical potentials of both Na<small><sup>+</sup></small>/Na and K<small><sup>+</sup></small>/K,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> the composition of the SEI is more complicated than that in a single metal; (ii) since two charge carriers exist in NaK alloy, the selective ionic channels of the SEI layer will determine which charge carriers will be allowed to pass through; (iii) solvent selection was critical for the formation of a stable SEI that minimizes the degradation of active material, but what kind of solvent is preferred to form a stable SEI must be determined; (iv) how much carbon contributed to the SEI morphology and composition in a composite electrode if carbon substrates are selected; and (v) it must also be determined whether adequate protection of the NaK alloy is required to avoid parasitic reactions between NaK and the electrolyte.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">The compositions of SEI films strongly depend on the electrolyte composition, which principally decides the primary nature of SEI films. Clearly, both solvents and salts are worthy of exploration. By exploring carbonate electrolytes, we would be able to replace the current Li anode with a dendrite free NaK anode.

            <span>Indeed, compared with previous HTLMB systems, the as-known Ga based materials in RTLMBs could provide a higher battery voltage due to their low reduction potential, thus providing a higher capacity and energy density. The capacity retention and capacity output abilities, however, are not comparable with those of prevalent candidates for next generation LIBs in portable devices. For example, as an alloy-type anode material, silicon has a much higher theoretical capacity (4200 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) than Ga LM, although they both have similar drawbacks when used as electrodes. In terms of the liquid nature of Ga, if the concept of “self-healing” is truly achieved, other active components with high theoretical capacity (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Si and Sn) can be used as assisting components in Ga anodes to prepare “self-healing” electrodes, affording an improved energy density.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">The direct deployment of pure Ga LM, however, has rarely been reported due to the problems mentioned above. As can be seen, conductive species, organic ligands (used to disperse Ga LM), and binders are required in the traditional preparation of electrodes containing Ga based LMs, inducing a low energy density, even failing to take the liquid advantage when acting as an electrode.</p>

            <span>It is easy to speculate that the electrochemical mechanism of NaK alloys is complicated and a reasonable expectation is that K<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions would preferentially serve as the main charge carriers, since K is more electroactive than Na.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, the charge carrier selection, to some extent, is controlled by the SEI layer, cathode host, electrolyte, and discharge products. For example, Goodenough and co-workers discovered that the NaK alloy could work as a pure Na ion battery if the cathodes only provided Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> pathways in Na ion-containing electrolyte. For cathodes that preferentially permit K ions, with suitable crystal parameters, such as K<small><sub>2</sub></small>MnFe(CN)<small><sub>6</sub></small>, MnFe(CN)<small><sub>6</sub></small>, and Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>MnFe(CN)<small><sub>6</sub></small>, K ions were selected as the carriers, while the Na ion electrolyte was gradually changed to a K<small><sup>+</sup></small>-containing electrolyte when the Na<small><sup>+</sup></small>-containing one was initially selected during cycling (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5b</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> Obviously, this charge carrier selection mechanism sacrifices some of the whole energy density of the battery. Fortunately, organic material-based cathode materials, such as sodium rhodizonate and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, were found to be suitable to concurrently allow both K<small><sup>+</sup></small> and Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> intercalations. In this design, the charge carrier was determined by both the initially selected electrolyte composition and the SEI components formed on the electrode surface.

          <span>The intriguing concept of dendrite-free features is what that draws researchers’ attention in the field of NaK anodes. The concept remains to be tested, however, because: (i) because of liquid NaK must be kept in a range from 9.2 to 58.2 wt% Na, when with the continuous formation of SEI layers, the active components in NaK are constantly consumed to a critical point, which precludes the formation of liquid NaK, leading to an irreversible phase transfer from liquid to solid NaK alloy; and (ii) routine cell patterns and assembly methods may be inadequate for liquid NaK. In a composite electrode involving NaK and a substrate, if the pressure surpasses the degree that the substrate containing the liquid anode can bear, a soft short circuit may be caused by the possible crossover of the liquid NaK (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5b</a>). The mechanical stability of the substrate after long-term operation should also be certified; and (iii) it also remains an open question if the liquid can be the kept phase during the whole duration of cycling. The concept of dendrite free NaK anodes should be carefully re-examined in full cell configurations that are operated within practical parameters.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">In short, we should note that most issues discussed here are relevant to both room temperature LMs and many metal-based batteries.

            <span>As discussed above, gaining control over the wetting behavior, to a significant extent, is the prerequisite for building RTLMBs. Previous studies indicate that the wettability of pristine gallium can be entirely altered by the naturally formed gallium oxide ‘skin’ on the Ga surface, decreasing the surface tension significantly (non-reactive wetting method).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit84"><sup><span class="sup_ref">84–86</span></sup></a> Similar to other metals (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Zn and Al), when liquid gallium is exposed to oxygen (even as low as a few ppm), a self-limiting thin oxide layer gradually grows on the surface with an estimated thickness between 0.5 and 3 nm. The van der Waals force that emerges from this skin allows liquid metal droplets to wet substrates in their vicinity. Also, this gallium oxide prevents further oxidation of gallium metal, and in particular, it leads to non-Newtonian rheological properties, allowing it to be molded into non-spherical shapes that are infinitely deformable, which is beneficial to electrode preparation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> Even in other gallium-based alloys (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> galinstan, eutectic Ga–In) with a high content of added species (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> In or Sn), the composition of this oxidized layer is hardly changed. Besides, electrochemical oxidation can reduce the surface tension even further, but only if electrochemical oxidation mainly occurs under suitably applied potentials that allow ion insertion through the oxide layer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> Another typical modification involves removing the surface oxide from the liquid metal to react with the substrate, which could be classified as the reactive wetting approach.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> In this approach, by modulating the surface energy in a typical metallic material suitable for the varied atomic environment, the wetting behavior could be modified.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> For instance, intermetallic solid CuGa<small><sub>2</sub></small> was obtained by electrochemical amalgamation of Ga onto Cu foil (the anodic current collector in batteries), allowing the Ga LM to easily wet the Cu surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> Ding <span class="italic">et al.</span> also found that good wettability behavior can be observed when Ga LM is in direct contact with a stainless steel current collector covered with a 50 nm layer of Au.

            <p class="otherpara">In order to prepare nano- or microdroplets of Ga based LMs, two main approaches have been proved to be effective, which rely on constructing a physical barrier between adjacent droplets (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>).

            <span>Although relatively high-volume changes are a critical aspect of Ga based anodes, this issue is only just starting to be realized. To address this issue, Wu <span class="italic">et al.</span> applied carbon species (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs))<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72,93</span></sup></a> as electrode skeletons into LM-containing anode materials (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>).

The rGO would be used as a thickener and stabilizer to keep the suspensions of Ga materials in a homogeneous state during the synthesis process. By further manipulating the electrolyte components, such as by adding fluoroethylene carbonate and vinylene carbonate, the so-called self-healing liquid metal-based anode could exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance. For instance, the Ga–Sn LM in a half-cell delivered high capacities of 775, 690, and 613 mA h g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at the rates of 200, 500, and 1000 mA g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> In Wu <span class="italic">et al.</span>'s opinion, the alleviated volume changes and modified SEI layer (with additives to provide stabilized and polymeric SEIs)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> are responsible for such good performance.

            <span>There have been several attempts to apply Ga LM alloys in Li metal as composite anodes during the past few decades, and the GaInSnZn LM is quite attractive because it has the advantages of lithiophilic behavior, non-toxicity, and a low melting point (&lt;30 °C). For example, Wei <span class="italic">et al.</span> found that this pristine GaInSnZn LM could be directly used as a less-reactive passivation layer on Li metal to relieve the corrosion and stabilize the Li metal.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> A stabilized Li-based alloy framework tightly attached by plenty of submicron-scale grains was finally formed on the surface of the Li metal, without any exfoliation or mechanical rupture even under bending and folding, through the spontaneous reaction between metallic Li and the LM at room temperature. Importantly, the less-reactive composite anode provided a stable SEI interface, even in a more corrosive carbonate-based electrolyte. The synthesis was conducted in the presence of air, however, so that an oxide layer formed on the LM surface to change the wettability between the LM and the Li surface. Considering the speedy reactions between active Li and other species (for example, water or CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) from air, safety issues arise during large-scale application.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">To resolve this problem, it is proposed to use lithiophilic free standing MXene frameworks (MF) coupled with the GaInSnZn LM to regulate Li nucleation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> Fortunately, the poor wettability of the MF with respect to the liquid metal, induced by the rough surface of the MF with irregular wrinkles and the high surface tension of the LM, could be eliminated through the introduction of a small brush. Moreover, this indicated that amorphous liquid metal nucleation seeds were stable against the MXene and could induce isotropic nucleation and uniform growth of Li, establishing an even potential gradient through the anode. The as-coated anode demonstrated a stable average coulombic efficiency (98.22%, 0.5 mA cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> with 0.5 mA h cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) in half-cells and long stable cyclability in a full cell assembled with a LiFePO<small><sub>4</sub></small> cathode. The better electrochemical performance was also analyzed and found to be due to the uniform Li deposition induced by the decreased side reaction and the stabilized SEI layer. As confirmed by this approach, MXene frameworks are suitable for the substrate to regulate the Li nucleation behavior owing to their inherent lithiophilic feature; however, the following concerns must be taken into consideration: (i) traditional free standing MXene films with densely compacted nanosheets offer a limited space for liquid metal absorption, and the external force leads to non-uniform coating; and (ii) whether this kind of MXene stack can effectively withstand the large volume stress from the liquid metal during the stripping and plating process is ambiguous.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Apart from its use as an anode coating, the GaInSnZn LM can be either coated on the Cu surface<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> or on the polymer separator<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> to regulate the Li nucleation behavior in the Li metal battery. No matter what substrates apply to Li associate with Ga LM, a major challenge is the possibility of an unevenly distributed product involving liquid metals during Li plating/stripping. For instance, Deng and co-authors proposed a self-organized composite anode, called Li/Li<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>LM<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>, which was derived from an alloy of Li and galinstan LM (Li<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>LM<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> The Li<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>LM<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> alloy served as a sheath and induced the deposition of Li metal underneath the Li<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>LM<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> matrix. As such, the Li composite anode enabled unprecedentedly high stability. Importantly, in their preparation, the LM was blade-coated onto a commercially available polypropylene separator under ambient conditions, indicating that this technic can be easily extended to large scale. Nevertheless, from their discussion, it is clear that the nucleation between the Li metal and SnIn sites was more preferred compared with the Ga sites, which further induced the isolation of SnInLi clusters from the GaLi matrix during continuous cycling. The potential influence on performance caused by the severe volume change of galinstan should also be examined.

            <p class="otherpara">Despite the bright prospects of Ga based alloy anodes, critical challenges remain before they can be applied in practical batteries. For the application of Ga based LMs in LIBs, there is no generalized way to tackle all associated problems, and multiple strategies should be accordingly involved. In terms of the inferior wetting behavior of Ga LM to other interfaces, both non-reactive and reactive wetting methods are the main choices, yet non-reactive approaches will be more preferred duo to their facile production and the amount of electrochemically active Ga based LMs. In order to alleviate the volume changes of Ga LM, although the applied matrix is porous, lightweight, and flexible, the Ga LM loses the advantages in terms of volumetric and gravimetric densities, and especially may lose its liquid nature, making the self-healing concept ambiguous. Notably, the implementation of the self-healing electrode containing Ga LM should carefully consider the influence of the non-self-healing binder and conductive additives on their real self-healing ability. It seems that only flexible batteries with aqueous electrolyte can directly use raw Ga LM as electrodes; however, the energy density and the reversibility are far from enabling their effectiveness and applicability. Although the required value of the energy density for commercial electric vehicles has been increased to 500 W h kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, it will likely be difficult to achieve such a value for flexible and stretchable batteries, even though having competitive energy densities are badly needed in such wearable electronics. Finding suitable electrodes is highly demanded for addressing these problems. Besides, the delamination of active materials during stretching and seamless device integration are also the most important technical hurdles facing these deformable batteries. For the application of Ga LM in Li metal batteries, there is still uncertainty about what the critical role of liquid metals is in this configuration and how to take advantage of LMs in the design. It remains to be seen whether the Ga LM can be regarded as a self-healing component during discharge/charge, in accordance with previous expectations.</p>

          <span>In contrast to Ga LM, most central questions about the wetting behavior of NaK alloy with a specific substrate and the formed SEI layer on the surface of NaK remain unanswered. Also, considering the differences in ionicity, size, and reactivity among Li<small><sup>+</sup></small>, Na<small><sup>+</sup></small>, and K<small><sup>+</sup></small> ions, the wetting behaviors of Na and K on the surface of a substrate should be considered, and whether they are distinctly different from that of Li should be explored. It is also important to investigate which SEI components are most efficient in stabilizing Na or K plating, and what their physicochemical properties are. Additionally, it has to be critically studied whether the mature technologies enabling reversible Li plating can be extended to NaK.

            <span>The search for a functional solid-state electrolyte is beneficial for the commercialization of NaK based RTLMBs because a raw NaK anode could be directly employed as an electrode in such configurations. Although Na-BASE is not applicable, to achieve this goal, a K-BASE (K-β′′-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>) electrolyte was developed by Baclig <span class="italic">et al.</span> in 2018, which was robust with a minimal exchange of Na ions in contact with the NaK anode over 7200 h at room temperature, so that only around 1.5% substitution was identified even at an elevated temperature of 300 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> Although there was a well-documented poor wetting of the substrate, in this work, by NaK at room temperature, the authors further discovered that the inferior wetting behavior did not have any detrimental effect on the kinetics of ionic transport. This was mainly associated with the slight pressurization within the NaK compartment that caused the NaK to contact K-BASE regardless of wetting at ambient pressure (similar to the effect of pressure-driven infiltration of liquid metal), which was further evidenced by the corresponding electrochemical impedance testing. Moreover, the poor wetting behavior could be further improved by the pre-treatment of K-BASE at 1000 °C before being used in cells, with the aim of removing detrimental species, such as carbonate and water molecules, adsorbed onto the K-BASE surface during synthesis. In addition, the assembled flow battery provided an OCV of 3.1–3.4 V, and power density tests showed promising maximum power densities of 65 mW cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> at 22 °C and &gt;100 mW cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> at 57 °C, where both electrodes were separated by a 330 mm K-BASE. By coupling it with an aqueous bromine/bromide posolyte, an OCV of ∼4 V and an energy density of ∼170 W h L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> could be acquired, which emerged as promising characteristics for grid-scale energy storage.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">In terms of the preparation of sheet-like electrodes, Xue <span class="italic">et al</span>. proposed a non-reactive wetting approach, that is, the vacuum infiltration technique, to physically force NaK into various porous substrates (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Cu, Al, and Ni foams) at room temperature. Nevertheless, these membranes were very thick, which not only decreased the whole energy density, but also increased the concerns about short-circuits during cell assembly due to the squeezing out of the NaK alloy from the metal foams.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> Accordingly, lighter and slimmer carbon materials with abundant pores are preferred, although previous studies indicated that an elevated temperature (around 420 °C) was needed to impregnate NaK into their carbon paper to enhance wettability.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> Therefore, effective techniques for immobilization of NaK into carbon substrates at room temperature are desperately needed when safety and economic issues are considered.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Inspired by the effectiveness of reactive wetting strategies, Zhang and co-workers discovered that NaK could easily wet carbon fiber cloth (CFC) at room temperature, by the introduction of a solid K<small><sub>2</sub></small>O layer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> Due to the poor wetting behavior of NaK on the CFC surface, the fabrication involved two facile processes: firstly, the Na and K molten metals were separately pressed into the CFC; then, these two sheets were pressed and merged to induce the alloying reaction between Na and K at room temperature, where potassium oxide was generated by taking advantage of a trace amount of oxygen in the glovebox. As expected, the K<small><sub>2</sub></small>O layer with a thickness of 30 nm provided a stable NaK alloy–solid K<small><sub>2</sub></small>O layer–electrolyte interface, which was believed to possess a strong self-healing capability during the charge and discharge processes. The K<small><sub>2</sub></small>O layer could realize self-healing with the help of a strong surface tension of the Na–K alloy, and could recover itself by chemical bonding. Nevertheless, such an oxide layer was suspended with loose coverage on the NaK surface, where the NaK may be squeezed out from the dispersed boundary among the oxide layers during the battery assembly. Very recently, Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> discovered another reactive wetting approach in which the NaK alloy could be intrinsically infused into the fibrous carbon paper with homogeneous distribution at room temperature, by the formation of K-based graphite intercalation compounds (K-GICs, that is KC<small><sub>8</sub></small>), as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6a</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> Due to the much faster diffusion kinetics of potassium than sodium into the carbon fiber matrices, the K-GICs could be easily achieved, which could improve the wettability and thus induce the infusion of the Na–K alloy. The GICs were also responsible for the fast electron and mass transportations, leading to a stable electrochemical performance, especially in full cells (where an open circuit voltage of 4.2 V after charging could be achieved in a pouch-type cell and it functioned stably for over 60 hours). So far, different contact features between liquid NaK and carbonaceous objects (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> carbon cloth and carbon paper) have been observed at room temperature, so a better understanding of the fundamental principles is needed.</p>

            <p class="otherpara">In our view, owing to the high activity of NaK alloy towards graphite, its infusion into porous carbon substrates should be more spontaneous at room temperature,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> and would be boosted if sodi-/potassiophilic sites were anchored onto the carbon surface, by using co-contributors such as metal and metal oxides, which have already been demonstrated to effectively improve lithiophilicity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, the infusion process is quite difficult at room temperature according to previous studies,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,62,82,100</span></sup></a> which may be possibly attributed to the varied surface properties among these carbon matrices. In order to explain this phenomenon, commercial carbon substrates consisting of tremendously porous and largely graphitic carbon, such as carbon fibers, papers and felts, should be investigated. Additionally, it should be carefully studied to discover what the diffusion kinetics of NaK are indeed for such substrates. The surfaces of most of the commercial carbon substrates can be kept in their pristine state of highly graphitic behavior, or specifically designed to be hydrophilic by further introducing functional groups (oxygen-containing) or designed to become hydrophobic by using materials such as a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit103"><sup><span class="sup_ref">103</span></sup></a> The hydrophobic and hydrophilic coatings can have great influences on the NaK infusion.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Considering the example of PTFE coated carbon papers (PCPs), we found that the successful removal of the PTFE layer can alter the behavior from non-absorption to absorption of NaK at room temperature. Firstly, the PCPs were pre-handled at 380 °C (since the melting point of PTFE is 350 °C) under Ar gas for 30 min after purchase to obtain T-PCPs, and afterwards, these T-PCPs were directly used to absorb liquid NaK without further treatment (such as vacuum infiltration or heat treatment). As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6b and c</a>, both the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum and Raman shifts indicate the presence of PTFE in the PCPs. However, after the heat treatment, no obvious peaks were indexed to PTFE in the T-PCPs. Furthermore, NaK could be rapidly adsorbed by the T-PCPs within several seconds, leaving a smooth and shiny surface (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6f</a>). Each of the T-PCPs could be loaded with NaK alloy up to 32 μL cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. In contrast, the liquid NaK droplet tends to ball up and avoid contact with the surfaces of the PCPs (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6e</a>), suggesting an unfavorable wettability, which was mainly attributed to the sodi-/potassiophobic behavior of the PTFE that covered the PCPs.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">In the case of the purchased hydrophilic carbon papers (HCPs, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6g</a>), poor wetting behaviour at room temperature was also observed, very similar to the results of previous investigations, which found that molten Li cannot successfully wet carbon nanofibers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit104"><sup><span class="sup_ref">104</span></sup></a> and porous carbon papers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> at room temperature. Importantly, the functional groups are deduced to be one of the reasons why the poor wetting behaviour of Li infusion is observed in both carbon nanofibers and porous carbon papers. A trace amount of air in the carbon substrates (containing water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen due to their porous structure) and functional groups would react with molten Li and form Li oxides, carbonates, or nitrides. The ionic transfer channels and pathways would be therefore blocked by those impurities, resulting in poor wetting behavior at room temperature. It can be expected from the wetting behavior of Li infusion that, although graphite is intrinsically sodi-/potassiophilic and is beneficial to the diffusion of NaK alloy, there are surface contaminants that pin the contact-line motion and cause contact-angle hysteresis (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6j</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> These reasons may also be responsible for the non-absorption of NaK in the HCPs at room temperature. As can be seen in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6c</a>, the intense peak of the D band in Raman shift indicated a low degree of graphitization, which further showed the existence of defects in the structure. After processing the HCPs at 200 °C for 60 min to obtain pre-treated HCPs (T-HCPs) and vacuuming in the antechamber for 30 min before transferring them into the glovebox, an improved wetting behavior was observed at room temperature (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6h</a>). This result should possibly be attributed to the successful removal of adsorbed air and/or partially functional groups.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Moreover, two obvious peaks were assigned to the K-GICs (KC<small><sub>8</sub></small>) in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of T-PCPs with adsorbed NaK, while no peak was found in the sample of T-HCPs with adsorbed NaK, demonstrating the low content of GICs during the NaK alloy infusion (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6d</a>). This was possibly attributable to the varied potassiophilic properties caused by the different degrees of graphitization. Importantly, the XRD pattern of the Na-GICs showed no peaks in either sample. The thermodynamically unstable nature of the Na counterparts and/or the undetectable concentration of Na-GICs are speculated to be the reasons.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit105"><sup><span class="sup_ref">105,106</span></sup></a> In addition, although the potassium/sodium metal consumption to form the GICs in the T-HCPs is negligible and the T-HCPs own the advantage when considering the energy density, the T-HCPs were believed to be suitable for the porous substrate for NaK infusion. Firstly, the presence of GICs indicates a good wetting behaviour of the selected porous objects. Secondly, the GICs exhibit fast diffusion kinetics, good wettability, and superior conductivity.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,101</span></sup></a> Thirdly, the charge carriers located at GICs should be reversible during cycling, which has a little influence on the energy density. More importantly, the porous structure will alleviate the huge volume changes of NaK during cycling, leading to an improved electrochemical performance.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Basically, successful scaffold materials in Li confinement can be directly applied to NaK anodes, but with a specifically functionalized sodi-/potassiophilic sites, such as metals, oxides, and sulfides (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6k</a>), especially should be emphasized on the capability of mechanical toughness.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit107"><sup><span class="sup_ref">107</span></sup></a> The dimensional structures of the promising candidates should not be densely packed, however, because the reactive wetting behavior requires sufficient absorption or reactive sites on the substrate.

            <span>The electrolyte has a significant influence on SEI formation in NaK based systems. For example, in an electrolyte consisting of 1 M sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate (EC/DEC/FEC), a small amount of NaK alloy was formed <span class="italic">in situ</span> on the K metal anode due to the formation of a functional Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> permeable SEI layer (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> NaF). No NaK formation was detected in two other electrolytes containing NaPF<small><sub>6</sub></small> and NaClO<small><sub>4</sub></small> salts, respectively, because of the lack of such a layer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit108"><sup><span class="sup_ref">108</span></sup></a> Building on this concept, one can deduce that the FSI<small><sup>−</sup></small>-containing species is more favored (as will be fully discussed later), and again, the mechanism of the SEI layer formed has a dominant role in the selection of charge carriers. The remaining open questions are mainly related to whether this electrolyte suffices to provide ample Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> transport and exchange at the electrodes in order to generate enough NaK liquid metals. Crucially, Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span> further extended this concept to build a hybrid-ion NaK RTLMB with a lithium intercalation-based cathode (NMC, Li<small><sub>2</sub></small>Ni<small><sub>1/3</sub></small>Mn<small><sub>1/3</sub></small>Co<small><sub>1/3</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and a hybrid-ion electrolyte containing both K and Li-ion salts (LiTFSI:KTFSI in EC:DEC). With the dendrite-free NaK LM, the full cell (paired with NMC) delivered superior electrochemical performance in galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, which could be comparable to lithium cells in terms of capacity, with a more stable anode than the Li anode after 250 cycles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> As expected, both Li and K ions serve as charge carriers to separately allow Li intercalation into the cathode and K stripping deposition on the anode. Na ions would not be involved during the electrochemical process, but their involvement in other processes is unavoidable. Specifically, from the spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve results, the whole SEI layer was identified as consisting of both a contact SEI and a cycled SEI. The contact SEI was readily formed from the Na<small><sup>+</sup></small>-containing components at a low current density, while the K<small><sup>+</sup></small>/Li<small><sup>+</sup></small>-containing parts existed in both the contact SEI and cycled SEI at high current rates. On the one hand, the formation of a contact SEI on the top of the anode surface in an alkali metal battery is inevitable, which is caused by the rapid reaction between the reactive NaK metal and the chemically unstable electrolyte. This will be more drastic for NaK owing to the increased contact area when a carbon matrix is introduced. Although stable Na ion channels in the contact SEI layer could cause the stripping of Na ions derived from NaK into the electrolyte, the electrolyte decomposition could be significant due to the large overpotential at high rates, so that the previously constructed pathways for Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> transportation are finally blocked.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">As might be expected, the composition of solvents in the electrolyte is important to the SEI layer formation because most of the organic components in the SEI layer are derived from the decomposition of solvents. Recently, the local distribution of the SEI layer over the anode surface was identified in an all-liquid NaK‖1 M NaClO<small><sub>4</sub></small> FEC/dimethoxyethane (DME) (5<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>95, wt%)‖Ga–In battery at room temperature.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy analysis provided clear evidence of the structure of the SEI layer, which was attributed to the traditional mosaic mode; that is, the outer surface of the SEI layer was comprised of an integrated organic–inorganic SEI layer (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>HO<small><sup>−</sup></small>, NaCOH<small><sup>−</sup></small>, C<small><sub>2</sub></small>OF<small><sup>−</sup></small>, NaF<small><sup>2−</sup></small>, and KF<small><sup>2−</sup></small>), while the inner layer close to the NaK alloy mainly contained inorganic products (NaClO<small><sup>−</sup></small>). In their work for battery designs, only Na ions served as the charge carriers to form the dominant Na-containing SEI layer, possibly owing to the electrochemical inactivity of Ga toward K ions. Altogether, this interesting study makes quite an effort to enhance our understanding of the composition and chemical stability of SEI layers. It pays attention to the issue that the crystalline grains that are formed, within an ideal SEI layer, must be distributed uniformly to avoid both the spatial variation in ionic conductivity and the potential electrolyte consumption. The SEI layers with such a mosaic mode would possibly feature high porosity with an uneven grain distribution, however, also making them highly fragile and incapable of avoiding continuous electrolyte consumption (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7a and b</a>). A similar report also attributed the drastic decomposition of solvent in the electrolyte (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> in 0.5 M KPF<small><sub>6</sub></small> in EC/DEC) when in contact with NaK alloy to the instability of the formed SEI layer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a></p>

In the case of NaK alloy, in principle, the ether electrolytes are only encouraged for applications in NaK–O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and NaK–sulfur batteries with moderate voltage windows. Another limitation is the possible incompatibility between NaK and ether-based electrolytes, which has been observed in TEGDME solvents, even though mixed solvents (DME/FEC 95<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>5, wt%) were proved to be effective.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> Thus, attention should be paid before directly employing ether solvents in NaK battery systems, especially their potential hazardous effect on electrochemical performance. Finally, protonic solvent contamination during the ether production process in most ether-based solvents must be thoroughly eliminated to minimize possible parasitic reactions. Alternatively, because of their excellent stability against oxidation on electrode surfaces and donicity, esters are the main solvents in Li based batteries, especially for EC and linear carbonates. EC can dissolve Li salts very well due to its high dielectric constant, but has a high viscosity and poor wettability. Linear esters can decrease the viscosity and improve the ionic conductivity of ester electrolytes. Therefore, esters are still the first choice in electrolyte compositions for NaK based LMBs. Nevertheless, the exact composition and structure of the formed SEI layer in esters for NaK LMBs remain uncertain, so it is still challenging to provide a universal rule for the describing the relationship between the electrolyte formulation and the SEI structure.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">It should be noted that the afore-described frequently used electrolytes are flammable and most certainly responsible for fire and thermal runaway in failed batteries. Recently, flame-retardant or nonflammable electrolytes have attracted special interest for next-generation LIBs, and this concept would be even more suitable for NaK LMBs because of the potential hazard of possible NaK liquid leakage. One emerging solvent candidate is alkyl phosphate ester,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> although the phosphate ester reacts vigorously with metal, which causes poor cycling stability of the cell. To solve this problem, mature technologies for LIBs, such as those involving high contents of co-solvents or all-fluorinated electrolytes, should be applied. Most salts and solvents in LIBs are versatile, so they may be suitable for NaK LMBs.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Recently, superconcentrated electrolytes have drawn much attention in LIBs due to the improvement in their electrochemical stability toward the cathodes, anodes, and SEI films, which is attributed to the competitive solvation of Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> by solvent molecules and anions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> When superconcentrated electrolytes are applied, the much higher anion population in the electrolyte disturbs the Li<small><sup>+</sup></small> solvation sheath structure, so that the interphase chemistry is no longer solvent derived (ester or ether) but originates from anion reduction as well. This result is significant for the interfacial/interphasial properties and does not exist in diluted salt systems, which can also be extended to NaK anodes. Indeed, it was found that superconcentrated FSI<small><sup>−</sup></small> based electrolytes in NaK LMBs were effective in promoting excellent electrochemical performance. However, sufficient knowledge regarding interfacial characteristics is yet to become available,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> and future work on the topic is urgently required. Notably, superconcentrated electrolytes have the drawbacks of high viscosity and costs, low ionic conductivity, and poor wettability. Accordingly, localized superconcentrated electrolytes containing fluorinated ethers will possibly be more promising as a trade-off between advantages and drawbacks.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The compositions of liquid electrolytes also have a substantial influence on the separator, which plays a crucial role in maintaining electrode integrity and enabling batteries to exhibit excellent and stable electrochemical performance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> For example, Celgard is the most common choice for LIBs because of its outstanding electrochemical stability, especially its stable interfacial characteristics and homogeneous ionic transport in common electrolytes. Most recent studies on sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have focused on glass fiber separators; however, due to the varied composition in the electrolytes for SIBs, the choice of separator is still not optimized. In SIBs, it is generally believed that cyclic solvents should be chosen for higher concentrations in electrolytes because Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> is preferentially solvated with the cyclic solvents to achieve sufficient solubility, but these cyclic solvents are incompatible with polyolefin separators. Glass fiber is chosen due to its superior wettability with the Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> containing electrolytes that are employed. Therefore, one should not expect a simple transition of the knowledge regarding previous separators to NaK counterparts, although the former still have a heavy influence on the development of the latter. Previous studies indicate that both Celgard<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,21,62,88,108</span></sup></a> and glass fiber<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79,82</span></sup></a> were functional as separators during the testing of symmetric NaK LMBs, although the selection process for the separator should be strongly related to the preferred electrolyte composition and concentration.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The electrolyte is the essential part of NaK LMBs and has an impact on the SEI nanostructures, the SEI thickness, and the composition and distribution of the SEI, regardless of which separator is chosen. Besides the possibility of side-reactions occurring with the electrolyte due to the chemical (electrical) instability of NaK, there are many other intrinsic issues related to the properties of the SEI layer, such as whether there are lean electrolyte conditions, the ion–ion and ion–solvent interactions, the anode volume expansion, the (de)solvation dynamics in a hybrid electrolyte, and many other parameters. A detailed understanding of these influences is helpful to better comprehend the key role of the SEI layer in the development of better NaK LMBs. Meanwhile, with regard to the morphology, formation mechanism, components, and properties of the SEI film on NaK metals, detailed information should be obtained by <span class="italic">in situ</span> characterization, including cryo-microscopies, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. A better understanding of the SEI is both helpful for rational design of both electrolytes and NaK anodes, and also a critical research area for providing highly efficient deposition of metallic Na or K.</p>
          
          
            
            <span id="sect1035"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">3.2.2.4 Proof-of-concept in stabilizing NaK anodes by interface engineering. </span>
            <span>Apart from the electrolyte engineering strategy, adequate protection of the NaK alloy is crucial in rationally designing a robust SEI layer to minimize electrolyte consumption. As gained from the knowledge of LIBs, an unstable SEI layer, Li dendrite growth, and the sequential formation of dead Li lead to the continuous consumption of electrolyte.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> Acquiring a corresponding understanding of electrolyte consumption in NaK LMBs has been ignored by previous research studies, largely, because the NaK electrode was generally accepted to be a dendrite-free anode. The electrolyte consumption was also believed to be neglected due to the presence of the carbon substrate. Nevertheless, it has recently been found that the electrolyte consumption may affect the cycling stability of the NaK alloy anode. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7a</a> schematically illustrates the potential electrolyte consumption during the K plating/stripping process. When plating, the K ion flux in the liquid electrolyte moves toward the substrate under the electric field, and electrolyte loss may occur due to the cracked or pulverized structure of the SEI layer, leading to the reformation of the SEI. This further results in battery failure once the electrolyte is exhausted.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">To confirm this approach, the effect of different electrolyte loadings (1 M potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in EC/DEC) on the cycling stability of T-PCPs with adsorbed NaK was investigated, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7c</a>. The mass per unit area of each NaK alloy in T-PCPs was 0.03 g cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. For the cell using lean electrolyte (an amount of 5 μL cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>), the overpotential significantly increased with extended cycling time, and then the cell suddenly failed after running for about 300 h. After refilling the electrolyte (another 20 μL cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>), the overpotential for continued cycling was back to normal values after 1600 hours running (inset of <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7c</a>). For the other two cells with flooded electrolyte that operated at the same current density, more stable voltage hysteresis without obvious oscillation was observed. Based on these results, the cell failure mode could be attributed to the electrolyte depletion. There are three possible reasons proposed to be responsible for this failure: (i) the uneven ionic conductivity due to the inhomogeneous distribution of grains in the SEI layer; (ii) cracks of the SEI layer induced by volume changes of NaK; and (iii) the large specific surface area for the SEI layer formation due to the presence of the three-dimensional carbon substrate.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Since NaK alloy is highly catalytic towards unstable SEI growth, a promising method to stabilize the interface is to introduce an artificial barrier between the metal and the electrolyte, which minimizes or altogether prevents their contact. For instance, a K<small><sub>2</sub></small>O layer applied on the NaK surface was believed to prevent severe chemical corrosion by EC/DEC electrolytes,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> while the protected NaK electrode exhibited lower hysteresis, enhanced cycling stability, and higher coulombic efficiency in both symmetric cells and full cells, while the amount of electrolyte was in excess, when around 1.6 μL mg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> electrolyte was applied.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Inspired by a valid approach in LIBs<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> and as a proof-of-concept, a protective layer was introduced on a T-PCP adsorbed with NaK electrode (T-PCP-NaK) before cycling to resist the corrosion due to the electrolyte. Also, this protective film was believed to improve the interfacial stability between the electrolyte and the NaK anode (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7b</a>). The approach was facile and realized through a direct reduction (dip-reacted strategy for 30 seconds in the glovebox) of the indium chlorides in tetrahydrofuran solution by T-PCP-NaK at room temperature. Afterwards, the protected T-PCP-NaK was characterized by the required instruments. As shown in the XRD pattern in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7d</a>, the film consisted of metal chlorides (KCl and NaCl), indium metal, and K<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>In<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> alloy. From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, the main peak located at 442.3 eV indicated that the In-based alloy phase was formed on the surface of the modified NaK alloy (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7d</a>). Interestingly, two dominant peak shifts were observed in the K 2p spectrum, which exhibited the successful formation of the In-based alloy and KCl. Notably, although the metal and the alloy are electronic conductors, the co-production of insulating chloride rendered the composite film resistive. Meanwhile, the KCl and K<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>In<small><sub><span class="italic">y</span></sub></small> alloy can possibly serve as ionic conductors, so that K migration could also take place through them. In this work, stripping/plating measurements were carried out in symmetric cells to validate the role of the protective layer, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7e–g</a>. The protected T-PCP-NaK cell in a lean electrolyte system (0.08 μL mg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) delivered flat voltage plateaus during the plating and stripping processes with a low voltage hysteresis of around 0.2 V, which remained steady without obvious oscillation even when exceeding 1000 h of cycling. Even when operating at a high rate, the T-PCP-NaK with a protected foil showed a very stable voltage profile, which proves that the protection layer is effective in stabilizing ionic electrodeposition. It can be expected from such results that the alloy layers are less reactive with the electrolyte than bare T-PCP-NaK due to their lower chemical potential.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> Apart from this strategy, other useful approaches, such as the atomic layer deposition-assisted method,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> electrostatic interaction,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> use of self-healing protective films,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> multifunctional complementary gradient protection,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118"><sup><span class="sup_ref">118</span></sup></a> and use of other alloy metals (such as Li doped alloys),<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119,120</span></sup></a> may be helpful to deal with the NaK interface issues.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">In short, for NaK alloys, there is a need to further advance investigations and for systematic studies in order to understand metal battery stability; their compatibility with intercalation-type cathodes (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Na-based or K-based layered materials),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> chalcogen electrodes,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122,123</span></sup></a> oxygen electrodes,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> carbon dioxide electrodes,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> and some of the most intriguing materials in LIB chemistry;<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125–127</span></sup></a> and the potential for NaK leakage during battery assembly, especially due to the pressure effect. These parameters are needed to exhibit in detail the practical conditions in real NaK metal batteries with high-energy-density and long-term stability. Helpful techniques and appropriate experiments are highly desirable to quantify the formation of dead K and dead Na, so as to evaluate their negative effects on dendrite-free features, performance, and fatal safety issues. The safety concerns related to the liquid NaK alloy are more serious than those of either one of them, and the alloy has a quicker and sharper reaction with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and moisture. The risks of fire and explosion during cell assembly and battery leakage under some conditions need to be paid more attention. Additionally, significant suppression of electrolyte consumption and significant interface reactions could be gradually achieved by optimizing the synergetic effects of all the required components in a full cell, rather than simple optimization of individual components. Also, with the help of massive research efforts on liquid–metal batteries, problems for the development of solid-state electrolyte based batteries are being solved, which have been hindered by many intrinsic limitations, including the incompatibility between solid electrolytes and solid metal anodes, which resulted in the progress of many aspects of this topic and will continue to do so in the future.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> Although there remain numerous challenges concerning the development of functional NaK cells, the promising results of some chemistries call for realistic assessments of figures-of-merit for practical applications, to meet market demands in terms of energy density, safety, and cost-effectiveness.</p>

      <h2 id="sect1080"><span class="a_heading">4. Conclusions</span></h2>
      <span>In the past few decades, as one of the beyond Li-ion battery chemistries, the emergence of LMBs has continuously unfolded. The representative anode candidates based on molten metals, gallium-based alloys, and NaK alloys, along with an expansion of the types of cathode electrochemistry in LMBs, have witnessed speedy development with huge achievements in the past few years. Revisiting LMBs from new angles with new approaches to electrolyte engineering has reached a fresh starting point, although the electrochemical performance advantage of LMBs has yet to be leveraged in a practical cell.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">On reviewing the state-of-the-art rechargeable liquid metal based batteries, it is clear that remarkable scientific discoveries have been made in understanding the critical hurdles and surpassing many of them. In terms of HTLMBs, given the severe chemical reactivity and rigorous thermal management that is needed due to the employment of molten metals and electrolytes, it is difficult to achieve high energy densities and long lives simultaneously at the current stage. It is suggested that acceptable performance can be possibly achieved by selecting the appropriate electrode pairs, and manipulating electrolyte compositions, along with the development of new elevated temperature hermetic sealing techniques. RTLMBs hold the promise of achieving the goal of high energy density, but one should note that the concept of self-healing liquid metal has eclipsed the focus on the existing problems, with many papers only reporting the routine electrochemical performance, whereas the associated problems, such as those related to interfaces, electrolytes, and the parameters of practical cells, still lack enough attention. If truly reversible electrochemistry can be achieved in RTLMBs, this field will undoubtedly witness rapid engineering advancements of RTLMBs using the experience built-up over decades based on knowledge acquired from the development of commercial batteries. Also, the important role played by solid-state chemistry in addressing the parasitic reactions in LMBs has also been confirmed. Alternative technologies, such as liquid metal–gas, liquid metal–solid, and flow batteries, might be reasonable in terms of superior energy densities but further development is still challenging due to their persistent drawbacks, in aspects such as reversibility, cell configuration, and safety. Notably, it is unlikely that each alternative strategy can be applied universally to solve all problems associated with LMBs. More importantly, although LMBs are quite intriguing for future energy storage, there are still several concerns that must be addressed before practical applications: (i) in the case of HTLMBs, it should be emphasized that grid storage is still a multidimensional cost-based challenge, although the LMBs are well positioned to simultaneously address multiple end uses at a commercially competitive price. Therefore, we believe that finding how to operate this system at a moderate temperature while keeping the advantage of rapid transfer kinetics is a good research direction, and that appropriate current chemistries and technologies in electrode engineering and electrolyte selection can be applied to this field. (ii) In the case of RTLMBs, the interfaces between the electrode and the electrolyte would be a sophisticated problem that has complicated their further deployment. The correlations between alloy features, morphological evolution, and the performance of the electrode are worthy of intensive investigation. There is no doubt that hermetic seals with advanced assembly methods would be in strong demand.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Due to the incomplete knowledge of their characteristics, continuous exploration of materials and characterization at the manufacturing level can promote the progress of LMBs toward their practical applications. Not only the intrinsic properties of the materials, but also appropriate cell configurations and testing protocols have significant influences on battery performance. In a rational approach to discovery, both negative and positive findings with logical explanations are important for the design of better liquid metal batteries. It should be further emphasized that there are a series of requirements for different sorts of energy services, and LMBs are well-positioned to satisfy customized demands, ranging from grid-scale to portable-scale dimensions, so the prospects for liquid metal batteries are promising. Accordingly, we hope that this report could shed fresh light on the thriving field of liquid metal batteries to help it become a vital base for developing rechargeable battery systems that can be practically used in our daily lives.</p>
