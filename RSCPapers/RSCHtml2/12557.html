        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> opened discussion of the paper by Licheng Sun: You indicated using separate panels for PV and solar heating on the same roof top which compete for space in the sun. Instead, have you considered using the heat that is generated from the PV and circulating the water to the electrolyzer? Then you also increase the efficiency of the PV.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> responded: That is an even better idea, and solves the problem of competing roof area.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Masayuki Yagi</span> asked: I am interested in the temperature dependence of the water oxidation catalysis. The linear relationship between the current density and temperature shows that the enhanced water oxidation is not ascribed to an activation process. If it involves the usual activation process, there is a linear relationship between the logarithm of the current density and the inverse of the temperature. How could you explain the enhancement of the water oxidation catalysis?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> replied: In addition to the thermodynamic reasons, kinetics processes are the major contributors to these temperature effects.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Masayuki Yagi</span> remarked: Diffusion of H<small><sup>+</sup></small> and proton acceptors (if needed) could be important for electrochemical water oxidation. Is the enhanced water oxidation catalysis temperature due to diffusion of H<small><sup>+</sup></small> and proton acceptors? Did you check the potential of the reference electrode when the temperature is changed?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> responded: Mass transport is a factor for this temperature effect.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Masayuki Yagi</span> remarked: Is it possible to observe a similar temperature dependence of water oxidation catalysis under stirring conditions? Stirring conditions might exclude the influence of the diffusion of H<small><sup>+</sup></small> and proton acceptors.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> answered: All measurements performed under different temperatures are under stirring conditions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Kristine Tolod</span> asked: Does elevating the operating temperature have any effect on the surface of the catalyst? Also, can you please comment on the stability of the catalysts when they are used at these elevated temperatures of up to 65 °C?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> answered: No obvious effect on the surface and stability of the catalyst by elevating the temperature to 65 °C was observed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Kristine Tolod</span> commented: Have you observed any notable degradation concerning the catalyst and its performance?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> answered: No catalyst degradation has been observed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Akihiko Kudo</span> asked: The temperature dependence of electrochemical reactions is very important. Efficiency and product selectivity of electrochemical CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction also depend significantly on temperature as I have reported.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">1 A. Kudo, S. Nakagawa, A. Tsuneto and T. Sakata, <span class="italic">J. Electrochem. Soc.,</span> 1993, <span class="bold">140</span>, 1541.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> answered: We have not studied the temperature effect of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction, your earlier work definitely broadened the knowledge on such an effect.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Akihiko Kudo</span> commented: Are there any tendencies in the temperature dependence among different oxygen-evolving catalysts? What does it mean if the temperature dependence is similar? The result should suggest some factors regarding the kinetics and mechanisms such as the rate-determining step.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> replied: We have studied Co oxides, Ni oxides and Cu oxides. They all showed such a temperature effect on the performance. These results suggest the kinetic as well as thermodynamic effect.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vincent Artero</span> commented: To continue discussion of the concern raised by Professor Yagi, I think it is important to check if the kinetics follows the Eyring law. To do that you should first correct the potential <span class="italic">vs.</span> RHE from temperature effect using the Nernst law and then plot current <span class="italic">versus</span> temperature. If Eyring law is not followed, then maybe the mechanism changes and I suggest checking the Faradic yield to see if the system transitions from O<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation to H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> responded: Good suggestions. We will check if the kinetics follow the Eyring law, and the possible change of reaction mechanism to water oxidation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Hyunwoong Park</span> said: Experience has shown that there is an enhancement of electrochemical conductivity. In an impedance study, as the temperature increases, the conductivity increases. The conductivity should be low. Try the same experiment with thicker films. You may have different results with pure metals.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> replied: Thank you for your suggestion, we may consider the use of thicker films.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael Wasielewski</span> commented: You are certainly correct in pointing out that electrochemical processes are temperature dependent. The performance of photovoltaic cells is also temperature dependent. Thus, heating the overall system during solar illumination can be advantageous if the system is optimized to work at elevated temperatures. Have you considered the temperature dependence of the PV performance in your estimates of overall system efficiency? Would the PV temperature dependence help or hinder performance and are we correct in assuming that you are using silicon PV cells as your benchmark?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> responded: In this work, we did not consider the temperature effect of PV. In practice, it is even a better idea to use the heat generated by the PV for circulating the electrolyzer.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> commented: With regard to the fact that silicon solar cells become less efficient as the temperature increases, I have heard that systems have been designed wherein water is circulated below and around the solar cell to remove excess heat. The hot water may then be used for domestic purposes, much as conventional solar hot water heaters are employed. I believe that some of these systems are commercially available, or nearly so.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> replied: The hot circulating water generated from the Si PV can definitely be used to heat the electrolyzer.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Fabio Di Fonzo</span> asked: Have you considered in your model that placing your solar thermal panel next to a PV panel means doubling the solar power input? This is critical for a correct evaluation of the efficiency figure. A more correct architecture would be placing the thermal collector below, with respect the direction of the sun, the PV panel in order to fully exploit the solar spectrum. Would this work for your system?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Licheng Sun</span> responded: Yes, we are fully aware that placing a solar thermal panel takes extra space. We are fully agree that a more correct architecture is needed, such as pacing the thermal collector below the PV panel.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> opened discussion of the paper by Shigeyuki Masaoka: The paper clearly states that the iron complex is not stable at low and high pH media. Could you comment on the stability of the iron complex at high potentials? Do you believe it retains its structure or decomposes while it is oxidized to its +4 oxidation state?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> responded: In the electrochemical measurements of the iron complex (Fig. 3 in the paper), the wave that corresponds to the oxidation of the Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small> species was not observed. The result indicates that the generation of high-valent Fe<small><sup>IV</sup></small> species is quite difficult in this case. This is may be because the localization of positive charge at a single iron center is not favorable. We recently found that the use of a multinuclear iron system affords the easily accessible Fe<small><sup>IV</sup></small> state due to its highly delocalized electronic structure.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> said: The comparison of the Pourbaix diagrams indicates that the Fe<small><sup>2+/3+</sup></small> redox occurs at much lower potentials compared to that of Ru<small><sup>2+/3+</sup></small>. However, there seems to be an opposite trend with the 3+/4+ redox bands. While Ru<small><sup>3+/4+</sup></small> redox is observed at the potentials applied Fe<small><sup>3+/4+</sup></small> band is not observed at all. Could you comment on this? While the 3+ oxidation state of Fe is easily accessible, the +4 oxidation state is not observed for iron. What could be the reason?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> replied: Based on the results of the electrochemical measurements of the Ru–OH<small><sub>2</sub></small> complex, we believe that the oxidation of the M<small><sup>III</sup></small> species affords the M<small><sup>IV</sup></small>-oxo species. When we consider the molecular orbitals of the Fe<small><sup>IV</sup></small>-oxo and Ru<small><sup>IV</sup></small>-oxo species, it is expected that the interaction between the Ru and oxygen atoms would be larger than that of the Fe and oxygen atoms due to the larger 4d orbital of Ru compared to the 3d orbital of Fe. Therefore, we currently think that this difference in the interaction between molecular orbitals affects the stability of M<small><sup>IV</sup></small>-oxo species, which results in the shift of the oxidation potential. TD-DFT calculation of the M<small><sup>IV</sup></small>-oxo species is currently ongoing to further clarify our idea.</p>

        <span class="bold">Ferdi Karadas</span> remarked: The study concludes with an interesting and important statement for iron complexes. The main problem with iron complexes is their tendency to degrade easily due to their high lability for substitution. Could you comment generally on the type of ligands that could be used to improve the stability of iron complexes?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> replied: As you indicated, the main problem of the iron-based complex is its instability. In general, the utilization of multidentate ligands can prevent the liberation of metal ions during catalytic processes. However, in the case of iron complexes, this strategy cannot always work as indicated by the present study. As one of the solutions, the utilization of multinuclear complexes is effective in smoothly accumulating the positive charge and preventing the decomposition of the complex during the reaction.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> asked: If you look at your Pourbaix diagram, the first oxidation of the Fe complex is about 200 mV less positive than that for Ru. It is likely higher oxidations are also lower. Is it possible you just do not have enough driving force to oxidize water with the Fe complex? Have you tried this at pH 5 to oxidise water, where the thermodynamics are more favorable? Your complex is also more stable at that pH.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> responded: As you indicated, the redox peak attributed to the Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small>/Fe<small><sup>II</sup></small> redox couple was observed at a less positive potential than the Ru<small><sup>III</sup></small>/Ru<small><sup>II</sup></small> redox couple for M–OH<small><sub>2</sub></small> complexes. In contrast, the redox peak corresponding to the generation of the Fe<small><sup>IV</sup></small>-oxo species, which can be a key intermediate to trigger the water oxidation reaction, was not observed in the current experimental condition. The result indicates that the oxidation of the Fe<small><sup>III</sup></small> species is extremely difficult, whereas the oxidation of the Ru<small><sup>III</sup></small> species easily proceeds within the potential window. We currently think that the difficulty in generating high-valent species is the main reason for the lower catalytic activity of the iron complex.</p>

        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> responded: We have not checked if the irreversible wave observed in the presence of water corresponds to water oxidation yet.

        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> responded: This study indicated that the nature of iron ions are very different from that of ruthenium ions and a distinct strategy to construct the active catalyst is required.

        <span class="bold">Seigo Shima</span> opened discussion of the paper by Mei Wang: In your data indicating the kinetic parameters, you compared complex <span class="bold">1</span> and complex <span class="bold">2</span>. Why you did not use a compound for comparison which has an NH group instead of CH<small><sub>2</sub></small> at the center of the bridge part because the complex <span class="bold">1</span> has a nitrogen connecting to the phenyl group?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> replied: Because the diiron complex with a SCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>NHCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>S bridge is very unstable, which thwarts the catalytic study of this complex. Although complex <span class="bold">1</span> has a nitrogen in the center of the S-to-S bridge, this nitrogen connecting to a phenyl group is a very weak base and cannot act as a proton relay during the catalytic process. In this case, both catalyst <span class="bold">1</span> and complex <span class="bold">2</span> cannot be protonated at the S-to-S bridge prior to reduction, and the catalytic performance of <span class="bold">1</span> and <span class="bold">2</span> can be compared to give information about the influence of the mercapto-functionalized β-CD on the HER.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Seigo Shima</span> asked: In the native [FeFe]-hydrogenase, the NH at the bridge structure on the FeFe site is considered as a part of the catalytic site. I would like to know why such compounds that connect a large molecule at the nitrogen site can function as H<small><sub>2</sub></small> forming catalysts. Does this compound catalyze H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production using a mechanism which differs from that used in [FeFe]-hydrogenase?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> responded: Yes, complex <span class="bold">1</span> catalyzes proton reduction to H<small><sub>2</sub></small> in a different mechanism to that catalyzed by [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Firstly, complex <span class="bold">1</span> has a nitrogen in the center of the S-to-S bridge, which cannot play the role of a proton relay as the NH in [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Secondly, all diiron hydrogenase models reported to date undergo the Fe<small><sup>I</sup></small>Fe<small><sup>0</sup></small> oxidation state in the initial step of the catalytic cycle, while the Fe<small><sup>I</sup></small>Fe<small><sup>0</sup></small> oxidation state has not been found in the catalytic cycle of the [FeFe]-hydrogenases.</p>

        <span class="bold">Tomoaki Takayama</span> asked: In the photocatalytic reaction using the diiron complex incorporated with β-cyclodextrin, it is essential to replace the ligand such as CO with the reactant such as an H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O molecule. Since the β-cyclodextrin covers the diiron complex catalyst, it is not easy to produce H<small><sub>2</sub></small> by reduction of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O molecules over the diiron complex. Do you have any information about the detailed mechanism of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production over the diiron complex incorporated with β-cyclodextrin? Did you determine a CO molecule disconnected from the diiron complex?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> answered: For proton reduction to H<small><sub>2</sub></small> or the reverse reaction catalyzed by natural [FeFe]-hydrogenases buried in protein environment, the ligand either CO or CN<small><sup>−</sup></small> at the 2Fe2S subcluster does not need to be replaced by H<small><sup>+</sup></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, or H<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecules. The configuration of the 2Fe2S subcluster is very flexible. During the redox reaction, the Fe(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>(CN) moiety could rotate to form a bridged CO and leave an open site for coordination of reactant, H<small><sup>+</sup></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, or H<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecules. Although there are many reports on the electro- or photochemical hydrogen production catalyzed by bioinspired 2Fe2S models, the detailed mechanism for proton reduction to H<small><sub>2</sub></small> or reverse reaction catalyzed by synthesized 2Fe2S complexes are currently not clear. In our 2Fe2S/β-CD-6-S–CdSe assembly, one of the Fe(CO)<small><sub>3</sub></small> moieties is outside of the CD cap, and could rotate to leave an open site for the coordination of the reactant as the natural 2Fe2S subcluster does.</p>

        <span class="bold">Michael Wasielewski</span> asked: When you compare the performance of catalysts with and without the p-aminophenylsulfonate group, there is very little difference. The presence of the electron-withdrawing sulfonate group on the aniline base dramatically reduces the basicity of the amine, thus making it ineffective as a pendant base to deliver the proton to the Fe in the complex. Please comment.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> responded: Yes, the N in the aniline moiety with an electron-withdrawing group is a weak base, and it cannot be protonated in a pH 4.5 aqueous solution. The present research was to explore the effect of mercapto-functionalized CD on the performance of the 2Fe2S complex/CdSe QDs system. We chose [{β-SCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>N(C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>-4-SO<small><sub>3</sub></small>Na)CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>S-β}{Fe(CO)<small><sub>3</sub></small>}<small><sub>2</sub></small>] as a catalyst to include into the cavity of CD. To make a comparison, we used [{β-SCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>S-β}{Fe(CO)<small><sub>3</sub></small>}<small><sub>2</sub></small>] as a reference catalyst which cannot include into the cavity of CD. Although both of these 2Fe2S complexes have no internal base that can act as a proton relay, their electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activity for proton reduction have been reported previously. In our studies, we found that both of these 2Fe2S complexes were catalytically active for H<small><sub>2</sub></small> generation when combined with 6-S-CD-CdSe QDs in pH 4.5 H<small><sub>2</sub></small>A solution under illumination. It is worth of note that the estimated apparent electron transfer rate from the excited CdSe to <span class="bold">1</span> is about an order of magnitude faster than that from QDs to <span class="bold">2</span>, and the TON of <span class="bold">1</span> is 22-fold higher than that of <span class="bold">2</span> under the same conditions.

        <span class="bold">Sang Ook Kang</span> remarked: The system looks simple at first glance but is not indeed. How sure are you that the flank can go into the CD inside? The sulphonate group is hydrophilic and it is difficult to visualise this getting into the hydrophobic interior of the CD. Instead of taking it for granted that your photocatayst can get into the interior of the CD, please check the fundamental spectroscopic data closely and assess whether they correspond well to your proposed catalyst embedment.</p>

        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> replied: Professor Darensbourg and co-workers reported the inclusion of [{β-SCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>N(C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>-4-SO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>S-β}{Fe(CO)<small><sub>3</sub></small>}<small><sub>2</sub></small>] into the hydrophobic cavity of β-CD and determined the structure of this assembly by spectroscopic studies and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.<small><sup>1</sup></small> This result clearly demonstrated that the NC<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>-4-SO<small><sub>3</sub></small> unit can readily be included into the hydrophobic cavity of β-CD. In the present study, we used the same method and the same 2Fe2S complex as in Darensbourg’s report,<small><sup>1</sup></small> and only changed β-CD to β-CD-6-SH. We characterized the assembly of complex <span class="bold">1</span> and β-CD-6-SH by HRMS, <small><sup>1</sup></small>H NMR, and IR spectra, which gave experimental proof for the inclusion of complex <span class="bold">1</span> into the cavity of β-CD-6-SH.</p>

        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> commented: I want to comment on the question raised by Professor Wasielewski. We have published (in 2004) a similar complex (bromo instead of sulphonate on the phenyl), and it was impossible to protonate the nitrogen. We used the bromo group for linking to a Ru-sensitizer, and we could not protonate the nitrogen. Still, we observed quenching of the Ru emission, probably <span class="italic">via</span> Dexter energy transfer. With your CdSe NPs you may manage to get electron to the catalyst and protonate the complex in the reduced form (on the Fe–Fe bond). So it still works but maybe <span class="italic">via</span> a different mechanism than when you can protonate the bridge prior to reduction.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> responded: I agree with this comment. If the central N atom of the S-to-S bridge is directly bonded to a phenyl group, especially to a phenyl bearing an electron-withdrawing substituent, the basicity of this N atom is apparently decreased. In this case, this N atom cannot act as a proton relay in the proton reduction reaction. Accordingly, the catalyst [{β-SCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>N(C<small><sub>6</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small>-4-SO<small><sub>3</sub></small>Na)CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>S-β}{Fe(CO)<small><sub>3</sub></small>}<small><sub>2</sub></small>] (<span class="bold">1</span>) displayed the same CVs at pH 7 and pH 4.5 in aqueous solutions, indicating that the N atom of the S-to-S bridge cannot be protonated under test conditions. The purpose of the present study is to explore the effect of mercapto-functionalized CD on the performance of the 2Fe2S complex/CdSe QDs system. Although both the catalyst <span class="bold">1</span> and the reference [{β-SCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>S-β}{Fe(CO)<small><sub>3</sub></small>}<small><sub>2</sub></small>] (<span class="bold">2</span>) have no internal base that can act as a proton relay, we found that they were catalytically active for H<small><sub>2</sub></small> generation when combined with 6-S-CD-CdSe QDs in pH 4.5 H<small><sub>2</sub></small>A solution under illumination. Because the N atom in complex <span class="bold">1</span> cannot be protonated under the test conditions, the two catalysts, <span class="bold">1</span> and <span class="bold">2</span>, may function <span class="italic">via</span> a similar mechanism, in which the protonation takes place at the iron center of the reduced catalyst. The comparative studies revealed that inclusion of a diiron catalyst into the cavity of CD can improve the photostability of the catalyst, but does not have considerable influence on the rate of electron transfer, and connecting QDs to the host–guest assembly of CD and diiron catalyst has significant influence on the rate of electron transfer and as a consequence, on the photocatalytic H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-evolving efficiency.</p>

        <span class="bold">Yosuke Kageshima</span> remarked: In the time course of the long period photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 5b in the paper), the amount of evolved hydrogen became saturated after 10–15 h. What is the origin of deactivation of catalyst?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> answered: The post-analysis suggested that both complex <span class="bold">1</span> and β-CD-6-S-CdSe QDs are partially deactivated under photocatalytic reaction conditions over a period of a long time. Although the stability of complex <span class="bold">1</span> is apparently improved in the presence of β-CD compared to the case in the absence of cyclodextrin, the decomposition of the all-CO diiron catalyst over long-term illumination is still a dominant problem for the deactivation of the <span class="bold">1</span>/β-CD-6-S-CdSe system. In addition, TEM images of CdSe QDs before and after long-term photolysis indicated a certain extent of aggregation of CdSe QDs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Yosuke Kageshima</span> further asked: Did you check the samples after a long term reaction? Was the deterioration of catalyst caused by damage to the semiconductor, or detachment of light absorber, and is it possible to check this experimentally?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> responded: Yes, we have detected the CdSe QDs in solutions before and after long-term photocatalytic reaction by TEM, which indicated the aggregation of CdSe QDs to a certain extent after long-term photolysis, presumably due to the dissociation of the capping reagent, mercapto-functionalized β-CD from the surface of QDs. Such detachment also leads to disentangling of the close interaction between the light absorber and catalyst. It is difficult to experimentally detect the detachment of the protecting group as it does not give an observable change in UV-vis spectra, and the concentrations of QDs and diiron catalyst are very low (1.0 × 10<small><sup>−5</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> M) in 0.28 M H<small><sub>2</sub></small>A aqueous solutions.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> replied: For homogeneous photocatalytic systems, QDs are good light absorbers in terms of their uniform distribution in solution, their tunable band edge and strong absorption intensity.

        <span class="bold">Akihiko Kudo</span> commented: Which is the reaction path for the electron transfer from CdSe to the catalyst in Fig. 3, through bonds, CD, just jumping, or something else?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> answered: Currently it is not clear whether the electron transfer from CdSe to the catalyst is through space, bonds, CD, or something else. One of the possibilities is when CdSe is excited, the thiol groups of the capping agent for stabilizing the QDs may act as hole scavengers to suppress the recombination of excited electron. Some literature reports have proposed a similar role for other thiol-functionalized capping agents linked to CdSe QDs, and recently Professor Hammarström and co-workers have found some experimental evidence for such a function of the capping agent of CdSe QDs.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vincent Artero</span> asked: You propose that the detachment of cyclodextrin is one reason for deactivation. Why not choosing a cyclodextrin with more than one thiol function to ensure more stable grafting?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> responded: This is a very constructive suggestion, and is the continuing work that we are trying to do now. To improve the stability of the linkage between cyclodextrin and CdSe QDs, we are trying to use β-cyclodextrin bearing seven mercapto substituents on the edge of its small ring (which is commercially available) as a protecting reagent of CdSe QDs. We will try to make photocathodes using this strategy to get rid of sacrificial electron donors. It can be anticipated that such a multi-point linkage between cyclodextrin and CdX (X = S, Se) QDs would be more stable under photoelectrocatalytic testing conditions.</p>

        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> opened discussion on the paper by Peter Brueggeller: Can you comment on how the catalyst acquires multiple numbers of electrons. I think this is a fundamental aspect of many such systems but the successive charging of the catalyst is rarely examined.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> replied: This is an interesting problem especially regarding the Os–Pd dyad presented in our paper. This problem is related to the question, whether reductive or oxidative quenching of the chromophore is the dominant mechanism. Especially for our dyad, both mechanisms could occur. Therefore the chromophore could deliver two subsequent electrons reducing Pd(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) to Pd(0) at the WRC side. The change of oxidation numbers would then be Os(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) to Os(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) at the chromophore side. I agree that this possibility should be examined!</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> remarked: Your molecular dyad, which has an interesting and logical structure, is set up for one-electron photochemistry. How does the second electron reach the catalyst? As it stands, it looks like some kind of short-circuiting would take place if you excite the species where the catalyst has acquired an extra electron.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> answered: I think that the species where the catalyst has acquired an extra electron stems from the initial reductive quenching of the chromophore by the sacrificial donor. This is a consequence of the excess of sacrificial donor present in solution. It means that the species with an extra electron still consists of Os(<span class="small_caps">II</span>). Therefore a subsequent oxidative quenching is possible producing an extra second electron needed for the production of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> said: Concerning your rather nice molecular dyad, do you see evidence for short-circuiting? I mean, after the first cycle you have one electron sitting on the catalyst while the sensitizer has been restored <span class="italic">via</span> the sacrificial agent. The excited-state sensitizer might abstract the extra electron, giving rise to the kind of short-circuiting I’m talking about. Have you seen this effect?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> answered: From the CV measurements we know that the Os(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) and Os(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) states are easily accessible. So after reductive quenching of the sensitizer by the sacrificial donor a short-circuiting effect could deliver the necessary two electrons by subsequent oxidative quenching. For a dyad, our catalyst shows a good activity. It seems therefore likely that this short-circuiting occurs, since Pd(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) would be very unstable, if only one electron sits on the WRC. Of course this idea has to be proved by transient absorption in the future.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vincent Artero</span> said: My question is related to the two-component Cu/Co system. In collaboration with Mei Wang and Licheng Sun, we reported a similar system in 2012,<small><sup>1</sup></small> using a cyclometallated iridium photosensitizer. The results were similar when a phosphine ligand was used but there is a marked difference in the absence of any phosphine ligand. In our case, under illumination, we could observe the signal of the Co(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) species. Using a copper-based photosensitizer, you cannot observe the formation of Co(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) in the resting state under continuous irradiation. Can you comment on the redox properties of your Cu-based dye with respect to the Ir dye previously used? Furthermore, we now have another dimension by which to study this system: we can vary the potential of the photosensitizer in the excited/reduced state (Cu <span class="italic">vs.</span> Ir). The positioning of this redox processes <span class="italic">vs.</span> the potentials of the Co(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)/Co(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) and Co(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)–H/Co(<span class="small_caps">II</span>)–H couples should be key to explaining the discrepancy between this work and the previous one in terms of observing Co(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) or not in the absence of a phosphine ligand. Higher consumption rate of the Co(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) intermediate compared to its formation rate might also account for the fact that it does not accumulate in the solution.</p>

Comparisons in the papers show massive increases, but these are not against a known standard. What numbers are we aiming for with a good TON? Is the catalyst with the highest TON necessarily always the best?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> responded: The TON values reported by different groups were obtained under different conditions, such as different concentrations of catalyst, different pH values, different temperatures, different electron donors or acceptors, different light sources, and so on. Therefore, we cannot simply evaluate the HER and OER catalysts by directly comparing the TON values of catalysts. Only the TON values that were measured under identical conditions can be used to make a comparison of related catalysts. The catalyst with the highest TON is not always the best. In addition to TON, there are many other criteria for evaluating a catalyst, such as TOF, solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, required reaction conditions, cost of catalyst, scalability, environmental influence, and so on.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: Of course we have checked our photocatalytic device against known standards, giving the same published results.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> responded: TON values can be one of benchmarks when we evaluate the performance of our catalyst.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> answered: The structures of molecular catalysts can be clearly characterized, and therefore this gives a chance to explore the mechanisms of HER and OER catalyzed by a molecular catalyst by means of various spectroscopy methods. This is one of the attractive advantages of molecular catalysts. In my opinion, the combination of molecular catalysts, especially those featuring self-healing ability, with visible-light-absorbing semiconductor materials to fabricate photoelectrodes for OER and HER is one of the promising approaches to large-scale solar fuel production.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> responded: Studies on molecular HER and OER catalysts are important because: i) molecular catalysts provide a way to explore the mechanisms of HER and OER; ii) bio-inspired molecular catalysts help us to have a better understanding of the enzymatic systems, PS II and PS I, and to learn from nature; iii) molecular catalysts can mimic the active edges of material catalysts, such as the side-on bound Mo(<span class="small_caps">IV</span>)–disulfide complex that mimics the surface of nanoparticulate MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small>; and iv) some molecular catalysts display not only very high activity but also self-healing ability, such as CoP<small><sub><span class="italic">i</span></sub></small> and Brudvig’s dinuclear Ir(<span class="small_caps">III</span>)Ir(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) catalyst, which are very promising catalysts for application in solar fuel production.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> answered: This is a typical problem of homogeneous <span class="italic">versus</span> heterogeneous catalysis. Some people believe that the optimisation of catalytic metal complexes and their ligands should be carried out as a first step.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> responded: As you suggested, the control over the second coordination spheres in addition to the catalytic centers is important. We have already started the project based on such a viewpoint and succeeded in improving the activity of the molecular catalyst for the water oxidation reaction by introducing the recognition sites to control the second coordination spheres into the ligand.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Thus, I think that this kind of strategy to design ligands can be a new direction, which enables to utilize the second coordination spheres more effectively and improve catalytic activity tremendously.</p>

        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> commented: A problem that I see for the future development of the field is that too many systems are being pursued simultaneously by different research groups. There is not much critical comparison being attempted and each group looks to be following its own course. We have no general agreement on the types of catalysts, the reaction conditions or the preferred products. This is fine for academic research but is not so good for the development of a solar fuels industry. Perhaps it is time for some common, but fairly narrow, objectives to be set: for example, surely it is possible to rule out many metals as putative catalysts in the search for something workable. We are still working on ridiculously small scales, forty years after the initial experiments were initiated by Shilov, Graetzel, Lehn, Porter, <span class="italic">etc.</span> The continued use of sacrificial redox agents, in my opinion, is harmful to the field.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Vincent Artero</span> addressed the delegates and speakers: To continue on the same track as Tony Harriman, I think we need to change directions and rather than discussing whether we need to select molecular <span class="italic">vs.</span> solid state systems or homogeneous <span class="italic">vs.</span> heterogeneous systems, I think we need to consider whether processes using sacrificial agents are relevant or not, and for what. In such systems a large amount of radicals are generated, which limits the stability of the systems. Also decomposition products of these sacrificial agents accumulate in solution. This is not the case when water is used as the source of electrons. In this case, the electrolyte/medium remains unchanged. To me, there is no point optimising a system under these conditions since the sacrificial donors or acceptors are also the source of decomposition. It will be relevant only when we will be able to use water as the electron and proton source in a tandem system. I therefore suggest to restrain the use of sacrificial agents for mechanistic studies, after checking that they do not interfere with the mechanism.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> replied: I fully agree with this comment. Numerous photocatalytic systems, containing either sacrificial electron acceptors for the OER or donors for the HER, have been widely studied over past decade. On the basis of previous results, we should push the research in this field a step forward by putting more attention on the photosystems and photodevices which do not require sacrificial electron donors and acceptors for solar fuel production. Additionally, for some special purposes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> for exploring the effect of a structural factor of the ligand or the influence of a secondary coordination sphere on the performances of HER or OER molecular catalysts, three-component photocatalytic systems containing sacrificial electron donors or acceptors are still one of the ways to make preliminary comparative evaluations before application of these catalysts and strategies to the fabrication of photoanodes and photocathodes.</p>

The radicals that arise from the sacrificial agent go on to drive chemical reactions leading to water oxidation or reduction but these are rarely taken into account when considering the reaction mechanism.

        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> replied: I do not think that all use of sacrificial redox agents should be banned. The oxidation of water is a four electron process. Otherwise also very reactive radicals would form like in the case of sacrificial donors. However, I agree that we should focus on the problem what a given sacrificial agent does. There are countries in the world, where water is more expensive than petrol. Therefore also an inexpensive sacrificial donor producing no harmful radicals could be a solution of this problem.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> responded: The interference of radicals derived from the sacrificial redox agent in the subsequent electron-transfer chemistry could be responsible for the fact that usually only one kind of sacrificial donor works in a given system.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Peter Brueggeller</span> answered: I agree that in many cases temperature is a negative factor, where heating destroys the catalysts. However, for very stable catalysts a slight rise of temperature above ambient temperature (40/50 °C) could be beneficial. Since solar radiation also produces heat, there is no need to cool the samples down. In any case, according to the talk of Prof. Licheng Sun it is important to know the temperature at which the reaction occurs. Regarding a standardised global protocol it is important to study temperature effects in detail.</p>

        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> answered: As you indicated, the establishment of a standardised global protocol for test devices is required and the operation temperature of the system is an important factor to be considered. However, the temperature to achieve best performance depends on the system because temperature can give both positive and negative effects. In my opinion, we do not have to set “standard temperature” to evaluate the performance of the devices. Rather, temperature should be treated as one of parameters to optimize the system.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Haruo Inoue</span> said: I think that we are having a very good discussion about the temperature effects on enhancement as Professor Licheng Sun demonstrated. In addition to the positive enhancement, stability and durability of the systems also depend on the temperature during the actual operation. The most crucial thing would be that everyone should be encouraged to examine the temperature effects on his/her materials and systems, because reactions and processes with rather large activation energies could be surpressed at ambient temperature, while they would be exponentially enhanced at higher temperature and may cause serious problems.</p>

The supply of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a bubble will disturb the reaction because the access of water to the catalyst will compete with the diffusion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and solubility of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in water which is limited. For these reasons, if pursuing the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion by photocatalysis, the vapor phase reaction will be the final answer, so a higher temperature is preferable.</p>

        <span class="bold">Young Soo Kang</span> replied: Temperature is one of the critical parameters for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction and water splitting reactions because it critically affects the kinetics of the reaction by achieving different activation energies of the redox reaction for the electron transfer and also adsorption and desorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and other reactants from the surface of catalysts.

Molecular catalysts that feature not only high activity for OER and HER but also self-healing property are very promising catalysts and are eagerly pursued by many researchers in recent years.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Anthony Harriman</span> responded: I’m less certain that price of the fuel has to be the main consideration from the beginning. I don’t think we should be too preoccupied with costing until we have a large-scale system in operation. I’d be happy to see the photochemical production of speciality compounds—not necessarily fuels—as long as the scale is sufficiently impressive. I do have real concerns about the scalability and the longevity of the systems that are being proposed. It will not be easy to get industry serious about our work until we can compete with heterogeneous catalysis. What would help, is some kind of general consensus on what would be the best range of products: at the moment there is a bewildering variety of processes and materials being tested but these are rarely compared or contrasted with related systems. I think this is quite wasteful.</p>

        <span class="bold">Mei Wang</span> replied: Just as I have said before, activity and stability as well as low-cost and scalability are crucial criteria for photocatalytic systems and devices from the application point of view. We cannot emphasize only one point and slight other points. We have to balance these points. Recently, Brudvig and co-workers reported a binuclear Ir(<span class="small_caps">III</span>)Ir(<span class="small_caps">III</span>) catalyst, which is highly active and robust for OER. Modification of the surface of ITO or metal oxide semiconductors with a small amount of such catalyst, only one monolayer of molecules, gave highly active and stable anode or photoanodes for OER. This successful example shows that if only a small amount of catalyst is needed to fabricate highly active and stable electrodes or photoelectrodes, and the cost of solar fuel production devices containing noble metal catalysts can be controlled to an acceptable price.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Shigeyuki Masaoka</span> responded: This is an important point. So far, an enormous number of molecular catalysts have been reported and we gradually become able to design catalysts on demand. Therefore, we need to start considering cost and scalability of the final system when we design new catalysts. It should be also noted that high-value added molecules can potentially be produced by molecular-based systems, and such a system should be constructed in addition to the conventional artificial photosynthesis system.</p>

We can’t deny that reducing nitrogen to ammonia under ambient conditions will be a game changing technology. The energy demand for the growing global population cannot afford abandonment of any source that we can responsibly explore to provide energy to everyone. Reduction of nitrogen to ammonia is as important as reduction of carbon dioxide for solar fuels.

The system with one radical anion photosensitizer attached to the Re complex is designed to perform a one-electron reduction of the Re complex, while the system with two radical anion photosensitizers attached to the Re complex is designed to transfer two electrons sequentially into the Re complex, thereby producing the state of the complex thought to bind carbon dioxide to begin the catalytic cycle. The latter experiment will be accomplished with two sequential laser pulses, one for each radical anion photosensitizer, which should result in one complete turnover of the Re complex in which we can observe all intermediates in real time.

        <span class="bold">Vincent Artero</span> responded: The bridge is almost fully conjugated but we have a few saturated bonds within the diimine dioxime ligand itself. This may reduce the electronic coupling and be the cause for the limited quenching of fluorescence. We do not have a crystal structure of the Ru–Cu assembly. Likely, the triazole ring is perpendicular to the diimine–dioxime ligand. Obviously, it would be very interesting to model this system using quantum chemistry methods.</p>

        <span class="bold">Charles Machan</span> opened discussion of the paper by Hitoshi Ishida: I have a question concerning the final mechanism of the paper, specifically the interconversion of carboxylic acid and formate. This should generally require an intermediate hydride. I am aware of some precedence for converting a carboxylic acid to a hydride, but this generally requires basic conditions or high CO pressure. For instance, if you treat Fe(CO)<small><sub>5</sub></small> with two equivalents of KOH under aprotic conditions you can generate HFe(CO)<small><sub>4</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small>. Your experimental conditions would not favor this type of mechanism, instead it would be more likely to cleave the C–OH bond of the carboxylic acid in a polar solvent with a high concentration of proton donors.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">You invoke the mechanism from our 2015 paper in <span class="italic">J. Am. Chem. Soc.</span>,<small><sup>1</sup></small> but our argument was based on an electrochemical driving force altering the relative hydricities of the Ru hydride and the formate ion, which is not the case here. Working with analogous ruthenium bipyridine compounds, we observed that the first reduction of these compounds was a proton-coupled event. The formation of a hydride can explain many parts of this mechanism, but it is not explicitly invoked in yours. Although there are obvious differences between electrochemical and photochemical systems, it is not immediately clear why the first reduction should differ mechanistically. Do you have any insight on this? Unimolecular CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fixation to produce formate should require an intermediate hydride species. Such reactivity from formic acid is observed thermally when Ru(Cl)<small><sub>3</sub></small> and formic acid are combined and heated, the Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) polymer [Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>(Cl)<small><sub>2</sub></small>]<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small> is produced, with formic acid providing reducing equivalents and CO through a decarbonylation reaction. As we have observed, the formation of a ruthenium hydride can produce both CO and formic acid with high kinetic preference; very little hydrogen is observed. Can you explicitly rule this type of mechanism out experimentally?</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Hitoshi Ishida</span> answered: In our reaction, we imagine that the hydride species would generate in the conversion from the carboxylic acid complex to the formate complex. We have previously reported the reaction mechanism in which the catalyst dimer would preferably yield formic acid.<small><sup>1</sup></small> In this case, we consider that the neighboring metal center can accept a hydride to support the conversion from the carboxylic acid to the formate. Unfortunately, we could not detect the dimer catalyst because the strong absorption of [Ru(bpy)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> used as the photosensitizer overlaps the absorption in the visible absorption spectrum. In this work, we have carried out the reactions in ethanol/DMA instead of water/DMA, and we have not observed the catalyst concentration dependence in CO/formate selectivity. This suggests that no catalyst dimer is generated in ethanol/DMA. This may be a reason why the formate selectivity is quite low in these reactions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">I feel that the researchers in the USA prefer and believe in the hydride mechanism and many Japanese researchers conversely believe the carboxylic acid mechanism to be correct. I am not sure which European researchers prefer. The reason why we believe the carboxylic acid mechanism to be most likely is that the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adduct generated by the reaction of a low-valent metal center with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is reasonable. Additionally, the mechanism readily explains the CO formation under the more protic conditions. It also reasonably explains why the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction does not accompany H<small><sub>2</sub></small> production. Of course, I know that there are many works on an insertion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into a metal-hydride bond, while there are few works on the interconversion of carboxylic acid complex to formate complex.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">I consider the possibility that there are actually many possible pathways for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction. Depending on the reaction conditions, a different path may be taken. Our work is on photochemical reactions not electrochemical reductions. In the photo-induced reaction, the electron injection is very slow, while in the electrochemical ones the electrons rapidly inject into the catalyst. Considering the results that the reduction product selectivity strongly depends on a subtle difference in the reaction conditions, all the proposed reaction mechanisms may be correct.</p>

        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> remarked: In your reaction scheme (Fig. 6) you have introduced a catalytic effect of protons on the pathway towards formate, from the Ru<small><sup>+</sup></small>-COOH species. However, to explain why the ratio of formate <span class="italic">vs.</span> CO increases with more ethanol, it is sufficient to see that the initial equilibrium between Ru<small><sup>+</sup></small>-CO and Ru<small><sup>+</sup></small>-COOH is shifted towards the latter when water concentration is increased; addition of ethanol means addition of water. Therefore there is not necessarily a catalytic proton involved in pathway. Have I understood this correctly?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Hitoshi Ishida</span> responded: We consider that ethanol, which has a very high p<span class="italic">K</span><small><sub>a</sub></small>, is too weak as a proton source to shift the first equilibrium from Ru<small><sup>2+</sup></small>-COOH to Ru<small><sup>2+</sup></small>-CO, and therefore we draw the reaction with a dashed line in the scheme in Fig. 6. No one knows the details of the equilibrium reaction between Ru<small><sup>+</sup></small>-COOH and Ru<small><sup>+</sup></small>-CO which are the one-electron reduced complexes. As you indicted, increasing the EtOH content possibly enhances the CO selectivity, but this idea would not be able to explain the differences in temperature dependence of the product selectivity in the different EtOH/DMA solutions. We envisage that the electron transfer rates also affect the CO/formate selectivity. Please be aware that increasing the EtOH content makes the electron transfer rates slow.</p>

        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> said: Your activation energy analysis gives detailed numbers of Eyring parameters <span class="italic">etc.</span> It is important to realise that this type of photoaccumulation experiment is different from the typical kinetic experiment where all reactants are added at <span class="italic">t</span> = 0. Here, the rate of product formation you observe is given by the rate of photoexcitation multiplied by several yield factors for the successive reaction steps, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> by rate ratios instead of direct reaction rates. Your overall yields are typically below 10%, which means that most of your absorbed photon and generated electrons are going elsewhere, in competing parallel reactions. Thus, in principle, an apparent activation energy for <span class="italic">e.g.</span> formate formation can be the result of a temperature-dependent competing reaction, even if formate production steps would be temperature independent. Therefore one has to interpret these apparent activation energies with caution: they are not activation energies based on reaction rates, but on quantum yields.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Hitoshi Ishida</span> answered: We realize that the activation energy parameters we obtained are apparent. Particularly, it seems difficult to evaluate the entropy parameters, and therefore we have obtained the differences in activation parameters between CO and formate production, which should correspond the energy difference in the product selectivity.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As you indicated, the quantum yields of the catalyses are below 10%. As the excited states of the photosensitizer are almost quantitatively quenched, we suppose that the major pathway to go elsewhere is the non-radiative deactivation, which is common in EtOH/DMA solutions. Another pathway may be a back-electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer or the reduced catalyst to the oxidized electron donor. Although there are many pathways in the catalyses, the rate-determining steps are few. We suppose that the rate-determining step would reflect the activation parameters. Of course, we have to keep in mind that the values are not real but apparent.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Devens Gust</span> responded: The orbital overlap required for electron transfer is generally greater through conjugated double bonds than through saturated linkages, but in some cases even saturated linkages are very effective. We must remember that a linkage that is very effective for forward electron transfer is also usually very effective for charge recombination (back electron transfer). Thus, for many applications, the linkage with the most overlap is not the best one to use.</p>

However most people at that time said that OLEDs could never be practical because they were too unstable. Today we can go out and buy large screen OLED televisions. For another example, the photochromic molecules used in self-darkening sun glasses are very unstable under irradiation in solution, but they are quite stable in the commercial glasses due to the incorporation of various photoprotection systems. Finally, dye sensitized solar cells are practical devices with lifetimes suitable for commercial applications.

Other well-known complexes are the family of Re(bpy)(CO)<small><sub>3</sub></small>Cl where bpy is 2,2’-bipyridine. First of all, these types of photocatalyst must have a long-lived excited state that is capable of separating charges (or of being reductively quenched by a sacrificial electron donor) in order produce the highly reduced species. The reduced species of these photocatalysts normally lose the coordinating Cl anion or solvent molecule to produce a vacant coordination site for an interaction with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Furthermore, low-energy pathways for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction to CO and formate are 2-electron processes.

Even in the DMA–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O solution, the photocatalytic system with a [Ru(N⁁N)(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>] type catalyst gave HCOOH as a main product. On the other hand, the system with a [Ru(N⁁N⁁N)(Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>bpy)(CO)]<small><sup>+</sup></small> type catalyst mainly afforded CO.</p>

        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> answered: Only the synthetic reason. The ethylene chain can be easily used for connecting two same diimine moieties but not for different ones.

        <span class="bold">Haruo Inoue</span> remarked: You showed two types of interesting supramolecular systems. One is forming formic acid and the other prefers CO formation. In near future, I suppose that you would attach them on p-type semiconductors. In this case, are you able to put ionic substituents on the terminal end of the ligand which coordinates to the Ru center to distance them from the surface of semiconductor in order to prevent unexpected back electron transfer?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> answered: Suppression of backward electron transfer from the reduced catalyst unit to the semiconductor is one of the most important factors for improving photocatalysis of the hybrids consisting of the supramolecular photocatalyst and semiconductor materials, such as electrodes and particles. Electrostatic repulsion is a potential method, and it is possible to introduce this into our systems. However, since the charges of both the catalyst and photosensitizer units should change during the photocatalytic reactions, exact control of this might be difficult. Our strategy described in the paper is that the rigidity of the photosensitizer unit might be applied to keep a longer distance between the catalyst unit and the semiconductor surface. For this purpose, we introduced two components into the photosensitizer unit, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, two tridentate ligands and four anchoring groups.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> commented: You explained the advantages of linking the sensitizer and catalyst. There are some disadvantages. In addition to the synthetic effort, the catalyst could quench the excited state in an unproductive manner, by many different mechanisms. You report lifetimes of excited states at the start, but the reduced catalyst can quench the next excited state by sending the electron back, or by energy transfer. You have an overall quantum yield of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction of 5–10%. Could this be one reason why you lose quantum yield?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> replied: In many photocatalytic reactions in homogenous solution, the rate limiting steps are the following: (1) light absorption of the photosensitizer and (2) electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer to the catalyst. In many cases using good catalysts such as Re(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) and Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) diimine carbonyl complexes, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction after step (2), which contains many processes including the second reduction, is rapid enough. If the step (1) is the slowest, no drastic spectral change of the reaction solution during the photocatalytic reaction is observed. If the step (2) is the slowest, accumulation of the one-electron-reduced species (OERS) of the photosensitizer in the reaction solution is observed. The photocatalytic reaction using Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) should follow the latter case after 3 min irradiation when all of the Ru(Clbpy)(CO) has been converted to Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(solvent). Since the redox potential of the Ru(Clbpy)(solvent) catalyst unit is more negative than that of the photosensitizer unit, the electron transfer from the OERS of the photosensitizer unit to the catalyst unit should be slow, and the OERS of the photosensitizer unit accumulates in solution as shown in Fig. 5a of the paper. This situation induces so-called ‘inner filter effect’ to lower the efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction because the OERS has strong absorption at 480 nm which is the irradiation wavelength. This should be one of the main reasons for the low quantum yield in the case Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO). In the case of Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>, this situation does not occur. The intramolecular electron transfer from the OERS of the photosensitizer unit to the catalyst unit should be fast enough and the following processes must also be faster than the light-absorption process by the photosensitizer unit as we did not see any absorption change of the reaction solution during the photocatalytic reaction as shown in Fig. 5b of the paper. In such cases, the added electron into the catalytic unit should be ‘consumed’ <span class="italic">via</span> processes such as reaction with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and/or loss of the ligand. Therefore, electron transfer quenching of the excited photosensitizer unit by the OERS of the catalyst unit is not a concern. Good examples of supramolecular photocatalysts can be found in the literature.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The quantum yields of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction were 45–46%.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another factor contributing to a low quantum yield of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction is rapid backward electron transfer after the initial photochemical electron transfer between the excited photosensitizer and the reductant. In this process, both while in the solvent cage and after the solvated ion pair is separated, the quantum yield of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction is lowered. Even in the cases using the supramolecular photocatalysts, this is a serious problem. We analyzed this process in detail.<small><sup>2</sup></small></p>
      <p class="otherpara">We have not investigated the efficiency of formation of the OERS of the Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> photosensitizer unit. This might be lower than those using the supramolecular photocatalysts reported in the references 1 and 2. I also have to point out, that the quenching ratio of the excited photosensitizer units by BIH did not proceed quantitatively (∼80%). This also lowered the quantum yield of the photocatalytic reactions.</p>

        <span class="bold">Leif Hammarström</span> asked: There are many intermediate states of the catalyst that could potentially quench. A strategy to avoid this is to have a weak coupling link to the catalyst and a strong one to the semiconductor, so the initial excited state reaction is always the interfacial charge transfer.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> replied: I agree that interfacial electron transfer from the semiconductor to the photosensitizer is one of the key steps in the hybrid systems. However, we do not have detailed information about this. There are many factors which we have to clarify, such as distances not only between the semiconductor surface and the photosensitizer unit but also between the semiconductor and the catalyst unit. How does the charge variation of the photosensitizer and catalyst units affect relative positions of these three components during the photocatalytic reaction? I believe that basic research using various techniques is needed for clarifying and improving this important and interesting process.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Michael Wasielewski</span> asked: Following up on Professor Hammerström’s comment, when the photosensitizer transfers one electron to the catalyst, the catalyst is then paramagnetic, so that spin exchange quenching of the adjacent photosensitizer, which must be photoexcited again to carry out the second reduction in the catalytic cycle, can decrease catalyst performance. Do you see any evidence of such quenching in your system?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> responded: The quantum yields of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction using the supramolecular photocatalysts which we have constructed were mostly higher than those of the corresponding mixed systems using mononuclear complexes. I do not think that spin exchange quenching is a serious problem in our systems. As I already mentioned, the added electron in the catalytic unit should be ‘consumed’ <span class="italic">via</span> the following processes such as reaction with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and/or loss of the ligand.</p>

        <span class="bold">Etsuko Fujita</span> addressed Osamu Ishitani and Yusuke Tamaki: Table 2 in your paper contains reduction potentials of complexes used in your work. When we compare the first reduction potentials of Ru(dmb)(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> (−1.65 V) and Ru–Ru(CO))<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> (−1.53 V), you observed an over 100 mV shift. However, in the case of Ru-Ru(Clbpy)(CO), there appears to be no such shift. In the former case, the shift is favourable for a larger driving force for photoinduced electron transfer from the sensitizer to the catalyst. How did you guess the structure to construct the supramolecule with such an amazing result? Is the shift due to the ether bridge?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> responded: We reported only one supramolecular photocatalyst where the Ru photosensitizer unit and the Re catalyst unit were connected to each other with an ether chain, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, –CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>OCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>–. In this case, the shifts of redox potential of the photosensitizer unit (PS/PS<small><sup>−•</sup></small>) and the catalyst unit (CAT/CAT<small><sup>−•</sup></small>) from the corresponding mononuclear complexes with 4,4’-dmb were 10 mV and 50 mV, respectively.<small><sup>1</sup></small> In the case of Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>, on the other hand, the structure of the ether chain was unsymmetrical, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, (PS)–OCH<small><sub>2</sub></small>–(CAT), where the electronic effect of the oxygen atom should be different between the PS and CAT units as described below. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3a</a> shows the CVs of both Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the model compounds. The irreversible wave with a peak at −1.53 V in the case of Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be attributed to a one-electron reduction of the CAT unit. Because of this irreversibility, we cannot determine the exact positive shifts of the redox potential of Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> from those of the model complexes, but it should be about 100 mV. We do not know the reason for the ∼50 mV difference in the reduction potential shifts of the CAT unit compared to the Ru–Re supramolecular photocatalyst. As the first reduction wave of the model mononuclear complex of PS was reversible, an irreversible reaction at the second reduction attributed to one-electron reduction of the PS unit of Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> should proceed. This potential of Ru–Ru(CO)<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small> was slightly more negative than that of the model complex [(mbip)Ru(mtpy)]<small><sup>2+</sup></small>. This is reasonable because the oxygen atom directly attached to the aromatic ligand of the PS unit should give weak electron-donating effect. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a> shows CVs of Ru–Ru(Clbpy)(CO) where the large shifts of redox potentials were not observed because there should not be strong electric interaction between the PS and CAT units owing to the ethylene chain in the bridging ligand.</p>

        <span class="bold">Haruo Inoue</span> opened discussion of the paper by Ho-Jin Son: Congratulations on your finding that the conduction band potential is controlled by choosing the solvent composition. May I ask about the mechanism of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction on TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>? Does this proceed through simultaneous two-electron transfer just like the electrochemical reduction, or through stepwise electron transfer processes as observed in photochemical reaction in homogeneous solution? If we have information on how frequently an electron is injected into the conduction band of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, that is, how many dye molecules are adsorbed on the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> surface (surface coverage), how frequently they absorb photons, and how many Re complexes are sharing the injected electrons, we could discuss this point.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Ho-Jin Son</span> replied: We now think that the catalytic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction will follow stepwise electron transfer from TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to the anchored Re(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) because the catalytic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction in our hybrid system involves multi-step, complex chemical processes (the slow CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> coordination to Re center, the liberation of Cl<small><sup>−</sup></small>, and coordination of a solvent molecule) as suggested in many previous results. Fortunately, the reported time scale (∼400 ms) from TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>(e−) to a Re(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) catalyst<small><sup>1</sup></small> evidences such stepwise electron transfer processes. We now believe that the real time scale is similar to the reported value (∼400 ms) although this value is not based on our photocatalytic conditions (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-saturated DMF solution with dye) but on the limited conditions used for their time-resolved spectroscopy experiments. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction processes can be considered to be slower than the electron-injection processes (from the anchored dye to TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>), a situation that leads to a mismatch between the electron injection (∼ps) and the chemical processes (∼ms). As the consequence, the injected TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>(e−) might be increasingly accumulated in TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. This means that the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>(e−) could await the generation of an electron-accepting intermediate during or after the chemical processes with the sufficient lifetime of injected electrons in TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>

Honestly, we do not have enough information yet. Energy levels would be significantly affected by the solvent media used. For example, the conduction band of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> semiconductor will be dramatically lowered by ∼−0.5 V <span class="italic">vs.</span> SCE, resulting in a bad electron transfer rate from TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to the anchored electrocatalyst (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, −1.34 V <span class="italic">vs.</span> SCE for Re(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) catalyst). Therefore, an appropriate treatment must be needed for use in water media. In addition, the energy level alignment (for the regeneration of the dye radical cation) between the excited state reduction potential of the dye and the oxidation potential of the redox shuttle would be essential in the fabrication of a Z-scheme photocatalytic system using Dye/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Cat. as an anode for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> responded: This is the purpose of our research reported in this paper. Our previous reports<small><sup>1–5</sup></small> describe supramolecular photocatalysts consisting of the [Ru(N⁁N)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> type photosensitizer where the three N⁁N ligands have different substituents, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, bridging ethylene chain, anchoring groups, and just methyl groups. Therefore, we had to use various isomers of the supramolecular photocatalyst to construct the hybrids because isolation of each isomer is very difficult. This should cause different distances between the catalyst unit and the surface of the semiconductor. We described this situation in the introduction section of our paper. Our proposal in this paper is to introduce two tridentate ligands into the photosensitizer unit of the supramolecular photocatalyst to simplify this problem.

        <span class="bold">Daniel Nocera</span> asked: What do you see as advantages of molecular CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction as compared to heterogeneous reduction methods? I’ll give you one that I think is important. In heterogeneous systems, it has been shown that many heterogeneous catalysts aren’t selective for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> but rather they suppress hydrogen, thus allowing CO reduction to occur (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, nanoparticles that they make from oxides exhibit a high density of strained boundaries and for some odd reason, strain results in hydrogen suppression). Molecular systems may target CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> over H<small><sub>2</sub></small> with design and they are more tunable. A second advantage is that molecular catalysts can be dispersed on solid supports and thus have, in principle, a higher activity per catalyst center. Do you see others?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Osamu Ishitani</span> responded: The selectivity of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction is not so simple because it is strongly dependent on various conditions. For example, the photocatalysis of most of molecular photocatalysts has been tested in organic solutions, or containing a small portion of water in very limited number of cases. In the future, we will have to use water as a reductant. This drastic change of solvent should affect the selectivity of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction <span class="italic">vs.</span> H<small><sub>2</sub></small> evolution. If you use an aqueous solution, what is the pH? We can also discuss this point in the cases using semiconductor photocatalysts. Recently, we have been testing the photocatalysis of both the supramolecular photocatalysts and their hybrids with semiconductors in aqueous solutions.<small><sup>1–4</sup></small> The most important points should be how the hydride species is produced and how it can react with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sup>+</sup></small> in both molecular catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts. We do not have enough information about these points.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Anyway, in answer to the question from Professor Nocera: we might be able to separate the oxidation and reduction sites, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, places for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction and water oxidation, if two kinds of molecular catalysts can be selectively adsorbed on the exact positions. We might use different anchor groups for this purpose, and we have to develop new adsorption methods of metal complexes on the various type of surfaces.</p>
