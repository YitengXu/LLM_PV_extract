      <h2 id="sect249"><span class="a_heading">1. Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>The complex molecular machineries that are routinely employed by nature to drive processes essential to life are a major source of inspiration for research in today's nanoscience. Stimulated by the efficient operating mechanisms of these machines, much effort is put into the development of simplified artificial mimics. A fascinating approach to create synthetic machines in which controlled motion plays a dominant role involves the organisation of molecules into mechanically interlocked (or topologically linked) architectures. A mechanical link entails separate molecules that are linked together not through a covalent bond, but through their shape. Chain links in an iron chain, for example, are not covalently linked, yet they are clearly and strongly stuck together as a result of their shape and their spatial configuration. A molecular analogy of two chain links featuring two macrocyclic rings that are similarly interlinked is called a catenane. Rotaxanes are closely related, but here a macrocycle is stuck on a linear axle – the name ‘rotaxane’ is based on the Latin roots for ‘wheel’ (rota) and ‘axle’ (axis). A system where such a ring can still slide off of its axle is dubbed a pseudorotaxane. Should the axle feature bulky moieties that the macrocycle cannot pass over, then the macrocycle is trapped and the system is a true rotaxane.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Since the 1980s this research field of interlocked molecules, which was pioneered by the groups of Stoddart<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> and Sauvage,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> has been booming and it has become one of the contemporary pillars of supramolecular chemistry. A wealth of appealing interlocked structures, including rotaxanes, catenanes, knots and ‘Borromean rings’, have spiced up the literature. What these systems have in common is that they contain macrocyclic components, which are held together <span class="italic">via</span> mechanical, non-covalent bonds. While over the years a variety of efficient synthetic procedures have been established to optimise the yield of these complex structures opening new avenues to even more sophisticated systems, an important question still remains: will they ever be of any practical use?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Some interesting future applications were already proposed for the earliest interlocked molecules, most of them based on the idea that different ‘stations’ can be incorporated on the thread-component of a rotaxane or catenane. The ring-component can, in principle, shuttle between these stations in a repeatable fashion, and control over the shuttling process might be obtained by the application of chemical, electrochemical, or photochemical stimuli. Such complexes were coined as switchable components in molecular electronics, as they would be able to exhibit tuneable on/off behaviour. Once it becomes possible to induce and control directionality in the motion of molecular shuttles, and make many of them operate in tandem, movement of objects on a macroscopic scale might be achieved, thereby delivering work. Section 2 of this review deals with such defined motion in interlocked structures, and the behaviour of miniature devices with illustrious names like ‘artificial muscles’, ‘tape readers’ and ‘elevators’ will be discussed, as well as the first successful efforts to translate microscopic into macroscopic motion.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Mechanically interlocked architectures can also be employed to regulate access to molecules, or parts of them, and this will be the subject of Section 3. Rotaxanes can serve as ‘molecular valves’ that are capable of opening or closing compartments that host other molecules, which can then be either released or contained. In addition, regulated access can be useful if a particular station of a rotaxane needs protection, for example because it has a certain function which requires controlled expression.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In Section 4, we will discuss another originally foreseen application of interlocked systems, namely as components of molecular electronic devices. Because of their earlier mentioned ability to shuttle macrocyclic components between stations on a thread, rotaxanes can in principle function as excellent miniature switches and logic gates.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Finally, in Section 5 we will introduce and elaborate on a relatively new application of interlocked architectures, namely as catalysts and in particular as mimics of processive enzymes. In nature such enzymes play an essential role in DNA synthesis and degradation, with fascinating examples being DNA polymerase and λ-exonuclease. They operate by threading the biopolymer through a hole in their toroidal structure. After threading, several rounds of catalysis (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, replication or degradation) take place before the enzyme dissociates from the biopolymer, giving rise to a process that occurs with high efficiency and fidelity. We will discuss the role of mechanically interlocked species in the first artificial systems that mimic these processes.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">This paper is meant to be read as a tutorial review and does not completely cover the literature published on interlocked systems. Emphasis is on applications and the most important examples from the last years are presented.</p>
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect263"><span class="a_heading">2. Mechanical forces</span></h2>
      <span>As mechanically interlocked species, the nature of rotaxanes is in large part defined by forces. It is force that keeps the macrocyclic ring locked around its axle, and the application of sufficient force to the ring can cause it to move away from any preferential binding sites it may have. But due to this tendency of the rings to always slide towards certain areas of their axis, the inverse can also be true: rotaxane-based molecular muscles can exert force, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> if they are attached to a surface. This chapter deals with precisely that type of situation: use of a rotaxane to exert forces on an environment. Where the typical strong man in a circus may bend thick iron bars, this field has yet to bend anything larger than a micron-sized cantilever. But given the fact that the muscles involved in the bending force are merely individual molecules, this is an impressive feat. Next to muscles, we will also discuss the exploration of what type of force is exerted by rotaxanes, and what macroscopic effects have already been realised.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect268"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Artificial muscles</span></h3>
        <span>Mechanically interlocked systems have often been used for the construction of molecular motors or machines.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> Therefore, it is fitting that one of the earliest achievements of rotaxanes as model systems was their ability to imitate the action of biological muscles. The omnipresence and importance of muscles in vertebrates makes them greatly interesting structures, and as such there is a certain demand for muscle mimics. In nature, skeletal muscles do work by having their individual proteins make stepwise contractions along a filament. The sarcomere, which is the basic unit of a muscle, consists of a thick myosin-containing filament which moves unidirectionally along a thin actin filament to induce contraction. Movement in the other direction results in stretching of the muscle, relaxing it again.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The group of Sauvage was amongst the first to recognise the ability of a double rotaxane to emulate this behaviour.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a><a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a> shows a doubly threaded bimolecular setup which forms a single interlocked system. Systems such as this are referred to as daisy chains, and an integer in square brackets denotes how many ‘daisies’ are in the chain. The schematic representation in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1A</a> thus represents a [2]daisy chain, and it gives a clear insight into the intended action of this mimic: analogous to actual muscles, the two ‘filaments’ of this double rotaxane could glide along one another. It is the interlocked nature of the double rotaxane that keeps all elements together. Movement was directed by the metal coordinating capabilities of the macrocycles, which contained a phenanthroline-derived bidentate ligand. The axles offered a complementary choice between either a similar bidentate or a tridentate terpyridine ligand, so that the entire system could accommodate either four- or five-coordination, depending on the position of the macrocycle. Indeed, when complemented by the bidentate in the axle, four-coordinate Cu(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) could be chelated in a pseudo-tetrahedral complex, locking the ‘muscle’ in its extended position. To switch to the contracted position, the copper was removed using KCN. Subsequent remetalation with Zn(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) drove the macrocycles towards the tridentate moieties of the axles to enable formation of the thermodynamically more favourable five-coordinating complex, as required for Zn(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) complexation. This locked the ‘muscle’ in its contracted position (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1B</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">This [2]daisy chain was the first unimolecular linear array capable of stretching and contracting on demand. Model estimations showed that the length of the compound changed from 83 Å to 65 Å upon contraction, which in a happy coincidence roughly corresponds to the relative amount of contraction that natural muscles undergo (27%), as reported by the authors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> The key reaction of the complex synthetic procedure that yields this molecular muscle was the double-threading step. It leveraged the coordinating capacity of copper(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) by allowing it to gather its desired ligands around it. Addition of a second fragment containing the terpyridine ligand and a stopper yielded the final muscle.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition to the demetalation/remetalation described above, Jimenez-Molero <span class="italic">et al.</span> envisioned a more elegant triggering signal to set the molecule in motion. They employed an electrochemical signal that could convert Cu(<span class="small_caps">I</span>) to Cu(<span class="small_caps">II</span>). Their intention was to have the five-coordinate Cu(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) fulfil the same role as the Zn(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) that was used in the remetalation strategy, that is, to have the change in coordination thermodynamics drive the molecular motion. Unfortunately, while Cu(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) was readily formed, the kinetic stability of the four-coordinate Cu(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) complex proved to be prohibiting to five-coordination, and thus to contraction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The reversible nature of most redox processes would have made such an electrochemical strategy especially appealing. Therefore it is a credit to the groups of Ho and Stoddart that they could achieve just that: a rotaxane muscle that contracts and expands in response to electrochemical oxidation or reduction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Not following the daisy chain approach, they settled on a [3]rotaxane constituted of a single palindromic axle carrying two rings (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2A</a>). These rings, based on cyclobis(paraquat-<span class="italic">p</span>-phenylene) (CBPQT<small><sup>4+</sup></small>), could be selectively positioned on different stations in the axle through previously established recognition chemistry: they have an initial preference for occupying the tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) stations positioned at the outsides of the axle. CBPQT<small><sup>4+</sup></small> rings can also encircle naphthalene (NP) stations towards the centre of the axle, but this is less energetically favourable. However, when chemical oxidation of the TTF stations makes them dicationic, this repels the CBPQT<small><sup>4+</sup></small> macrocycles and drives them towards the now favourable NP stations. A subsequent reduction of the TTF<small><sup>2+</sup></small> stations back to their neutral TTF form allows the rings to diffuse back to their initially favoured positions. Thus, a [3]rotaxane was achieved where two rings could actively approach one another, driven by electrostatic repulsion, and where the initial state could be regenerated after passive diffusion (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2A</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">In itself, the above did not yet mimic the action of a muscle. This comparison did become valid when the CBPQT<small><sup>4+</sup></small>-macrocycles were equipped with a disulphide tether to allow their immobilisation on a gold-coated surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Thus, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2B</a>, the linear [3]rotaxanes were assembled on a gold-coated silicon cantilever array sporting four parallel thin cantilevers. This array was placed in a fluid cell, and the spatial position of each cantilever was monitored. Upon introduction of aqueous Fe(ClO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small> (oxidant), the cantilever beams were found to bend upwards. Follow-up addition of ascorbic acid as a reductant brought the cantilevers back to their original positions. This behaviour was observed for up to 25 cycles (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2C</a>),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> with a slight attenuation that was ascribed to chemical and/or physical degradation of the applied monolayer of rotaxane molecules.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting discussion of the actual forces involved in the bending of the cantilever is given in a follow-up full paper.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> There, the mean compression per anchored molecule was estimated to be a mere 0.001 pm, even though the inter-ring distances are altered by an estimated minimum of 1.2 nm after switching (with a maximum of 2.8 nm – the switching distance depends on whether the axle is fully stretched when TTF is neutral). Altogether, this illustrates how many molecules working together can assert a macroscopic effect, even when they are randomly aligned on an unordered surface.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Additional methods for triggering ‘muscle’ contraction have been reported in more recent publications. The group of Huang, for example, have reported a [2]daisy chain that is based on two interlocked alkane-appended copillar[5]arenes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> When dissolved in chloroform, the muscle would be in its contracted state, controlled by dispersion forces between the alkane axles that drive the two rings away from each other. In a polar solvent such as DMSO, on the other hand, these forces were overcome by solvent–rotaxane interactions, and the rings would slide towards one another, extending the muscle. For this solvent-driven system, the occupation of stretched or contracted states was merely statistical, as opposed to the clear-cut switching in the systems described above. This probably stems from the lack of well-defined stations on the threaded axles. However, this lack of station-dependence concurrently offered an elegant upside: by varying the percentage of polar solvent, the muscle could be extended or contracted in an almost continuous fashion, just like natural muscle filaments can.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The last system we will discuss here once again uses a different mode of switching, namely by changes in pH. Romuald <span class="italic">et al.</span> recently described what practically amounts to a [1]daisy chain.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> This complex interlocked system, shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3A</a>, was obtained by conjoining the tails of a precursor [2]daisy chain. The resulting unimolecular system could be contracted and stretched, just like a linear [2]daisy chain, but in this case, the result was the widening or tightening of the macrocycle. In vertebrates, circular muscles such as sphincters are essential, which makes this unique example of a [1]daisy chain particularly interesting. Its molecular structure contains two dibenzo-24-crown-8 (DB24C8) rings that surround a single, interlinking thread. The thread contains two stations for each of the rings (four stations in total). At low pH, the two rings are located around the ammonium stations (green balls, see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3B</a>) and the circular muscle lies in its relaxed conformation. After deprotonation of the ammonium stations, the two DB24C8 cycles slide towards the triazolium stations (pink balls in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3B</a>) to dock there, which forces the molecule to adopt a contracted conformation. Reprotonation relaxed the circular muscle again. Such pH-switchable behaviour has been extensively covered by the group of Coutrot<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> (see references therein) and it offers a complementary alternative to other methods of switching the state of molecular muscles.</p>

        <span>The cantilevers that were described above as macroscopic objects that could be bent by linear rotaxane muscles (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2B</a>) can also be used to do the reverse: by precisely moving a cantilever attached to a rotaxane, the state of the rotaxane can be changed. In cases like this, the cantilever is part of an atomic force microscope (AFM). In AFM, minute cantilevers that bear a tiny tip at their extremity are slid over a surface. The degree of bending of the cantilever is monitored using a photodiode, which detects the light of a laser beam that is continuously aimed at the AFM tip. Any change in the tip's orientation results in a different deflection of the beam. Surface features that the AFM tip encounters will cause the tip to bend through inter-atomic forces, and this is detected in the same way. As a result, an AFM can be used to map the ‘force profile’ of a surface, which generally translates quite well into a height map, allowing AFM to even detect single molecules that lie on a sufficiently flat surface. The interaction between AFM and rotaxanes, however, does not focus on the microscopy, but on the force: an AFM is ideally suited to measure forces on the smallest imaginable scale.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In a collaboration between the groups of Leigh and Duwez, a surface-mounted rotaxane with two ‘stations’ in its axle was developed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> This [2]rotaxane, shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>, consisted of a benzylic amide macrocycle mechanically locked onto a thread bearing both fumaramide and succinic amide-ester sites. Each of these could bind the macrocycle through up to four hydrogen bonds, but the macrocycle had a preference for the fumaramide station. The axle was stoppered by a diphenylethyl ester moiety on one end and a disulphide that would graft to a gold substrate on the other, and the macrocycle was equipped with a long poly(ethylene glycol) chain which could aspecifically adsorb onto an AFM tip. This adsorption allowed the direct manipulation of the macrocycle by moving the AFM tip: it proved possible to move the macrocycle from its preferred station up to the lower-affinity succinic one, and to sense its attempts to diffuse back (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">If left to freely equilibrate, any macrocycle in this system that was positioned on the succinic station would diffuse back towards the preferred fumaramidic station. In a way, such a macrocycle would always move in the same direction, subsequently generating a directional force. And indeed, the authors demonstrated that such biased Brownian motion of the molecular ring does exactly that. By sensing the force exerted on the AFM tip by the macrocycle, an estimation was made of the forces involved in this biased sliding. By exerting a counterforce with the AFM tip, they revealed that the macrocycle travels back to its preferred station even against an external load of up to 30 pN. This result showed that individual rotaxanes can generate directional forces of a magnitude comparable to those generated by naturally occurring molecular machines such as real muscles, which typically generate forces in between 5 and 60 pN, as discussed in the original report.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting application of combining AFM and rotaxanes was reported three years earlier by the group of Lindsay.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> They described a nanomechanical molecular “tape reader” rotaxane that could be used to probe the secondary structure of DNA. Their setup was also based on a surface-grafted rotaxane (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5A</a>). To construct it, a linear axle containing an adamantane station was built up on a surface. Then, β-cyclodextrin spontaneously docked onto the adamantane station, after which a stopper was attached to the axle, creating the rotaxane. Instead of a conventional stopper, a specifically designed thread of DNA was used. In its stretched conformation, this DNA could be threaded by the β-cyclodextrin, yet the DNA still acted as a stopper: its secondary structure assumed hairpin conformations (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5B</a>). These large structural features were too sterically bulky for the macrocycle to thread over. The purpose of this setup was to gain insight into the forces needed to unfold these hairpins by means of forcing them to thread through a small pore, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> through the opening of the β-cyclodextrin.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">To perform their experiment, the β-cyclodextrin was equipped with a protected thiol group that could be unveiled just prior to the experiment. This allowed the direct conjugation of the macrocycle to an AFM tip featuring covalently linked PEG terminated with vinylsulfone groups. The resulting covalent linkage allowed the exertion of forces up to 400 pN, which would not have been possible with the non-specific adsorption method used in the system described above. The resisting forces registered by the AFM tip after the β-cyclodextrin was set in motion were closely monitored, and it was found that a difference between various sizes of hairpins could be detected based on the resulting force curves (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5C</a>). It is impressive that this complex setup could indeed provide information about the secondary structure of such an important molecule as DNA. Regrettably, oligomers that contained alternating blocks of purines and pyrimidines exhibited no composition-dependent signal above the noise level.

        <h3 id="sect359"><span class="b_heading">2.3. Polyrotaxane materials</span></h3>
        <span>Having just described a rotaxane system where a cyclodextrin acted as the macrocycle, it is now time to describe a special class of rotaxanes: polyrotaxane materials. As their name implies, they consist of long axles threaded with multiple macrocycles, and multiple CDs threaded on PEG is one of the most thoroughly studied polyrotaxane materials to date.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> Due to their low cytotoxicity and controllable size, CD-based polyrotaxanes have allowed the formation of interesting materials. For example, by using a variety of scattering techniques, Mayumi and Ito have shown that molecular dynamics in this polyrotaxane are much slower than in free PEG.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> By admixing a bicyclic cross-linker, presumably two connected cyclodextrins, the polyrotaxanes formed gels with appealing material properties: after uniaxial strain, no spatial inhomogeneities were formed, causing the gel to revert to its original shape. This elasticity probably finds its root in the large degree of molecular freedom the PEG chains have, as they are cross-linked by dynamic sets of rings that are free to slide or move to alleviate local strain.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">There are a variety of potential applications for CD-PEG polyrotaxanes in biotechnology. For example, by using drug-appended CDs threaded on a PEG with bio-degradable stoppers, the mechanically linked drugs were released when these stoppers were degraded inside cells, allowing multivalent delivery or controlled release, depending on the specifics of the polyrotaxane.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Gene delivery is another possibility, this time employing cationic CDs. For example, the group of Thompson has shown that a four-arm PEG loaded with multiple cationic CDs can be used as a DNA transfection vector, to effect gene silencing.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> In all these cases, the rotaxane architecture is essential to the functionality of the reported materials, mostly through the material properties imparted by a rotaxane's internal freedom of movement. We would like to refer to the cited review for readers who want to learn more about polyrotaxanes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The final class of polyrotaxane materials we discuss here does not yet have a function by itself, apart from being quite powerful at achieving the organisation of rotaxanes. Various metal–organic frameworks exist where the organic linkers that connect the metal centres are at the same time axles that carry a macrocycle, as exemplified by the report from the groups of Schurko and Loeb,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> with more examples cited therein. Effectively, the metal centres are linked by rotaxanes to form a framework of up to millimetre size, resulting in highly ordered arrays of myriad macrocycles (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig6">Fig. 6A</a>). This high degree of order allows various detection techniques to characterise the dynamics of the components. For example, solid state NMR was used to verify the dynamic movement of the rings inside the otherwise rigid framework. As predicted by the authors, “the ability to arrange mobile and functional molecular components in a highly dense and predictable array is a crucial step towards the generation of solid-state devices with multiple functions and properties,”<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> making such polyrotaxane frameworks promising precursors to actually functional ones.</p>

        <h3 id="sect380"><span class="b_heading">2.4 Other molecular machines</span></h3>
        <span>This final part of the section on rotaxanes and forces discusses a variety of molecular machines or motors,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> which in many cases are related to the artificial muscles described above. One of these systems is the molecular elevator developed by the groups of Stoddart and Credi.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> Their reported device consisted of a platform-like component that was mounted on a three-legged rig (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7A</a>). Reminiscent of switchable linear muscles at first, this molecular machine is far more complex due to its multivalent nature. This elevator employed DB24C8 rings that were initially mounted on ammonia stations, not on bipyridinium (BIPY<small><sup>2+</sup></small>) stations that were also available in the axles. The DB24C8 rings were fused <span class="italic">via</span> an aromatic core to form a trimeric unit. Their axles, too, were trimeric in nature, being linked <span class="italic">via</span> another aromatic core. In an acidic environment, the ammonia stations were preferred because they allowed for the formation of hydrogen bonds with the rings. On addition of base, the ammonia station was deprotonated, and the DB24C8 rings moved to the BIPY<small><sup>2+</sup></small> stations further away from the core. Exhibiting a clear-cut on-off reversible behaviour, reacidification would drive the platform back ‘up’ to the ammonia stations. Its microscopic reversibility makes this intricate rotaxane an exponent of current molecular machines.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">From thermodynamic considerations, it could be established that the energy available for the relevant upwards (acidification) and downwards (base addition) movements amounted to approximately &gt;4 and 21 kcal mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> Because the distance travelled by the platform upon each elevator trip was about 0.7 nm, the elevator thus potentially generated a force of up to 200 pN on its way down, which is more than one order of magnitude larger than the forces generated by natural actuators.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">This elevator would not be comfortable for passengers, though: titration experiments shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7B</a> revealed that the multivalent platform descends one ring at a time, as opposed to in one concerted slide (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7C</a>). Multivalency in recognition, as exhibited by this elevator, is a well-established concept, but its past investigation has often been restricted to the acquisition of thermodynamic parameters, not taking the timing of events into account. This elevator provided the opportunity to study how three equivalent recognition sites responded to being simultaneously addressed within a single molecularly constrained environment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> The results presented by Badjic <span class="italic">et al.</span> were a clear indicator of the one-at-a-time mechanism of multivalent processes. As described by the authors: “the molecular elevator is more reminiscent of a legged animal than it is of the passenger elevator.”</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The elevator described above had a well-defined directionality of motion because the ‘pillars’ of the ‘elevator shaft’ were all attached to the central core in the same direction. This motion was always highly discrete, because of the finite length of the axles. Theoretically, infinite motion would be obtainable if one end of an axle were to be connected to its other end. This semantically leads us to the realm of catenanes, mechanically interlocked macrocyclic molecules. In this connection, the unidirectional rotary motor described by Hernández, Kay and Leigh deserves mentioning here.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> It contains two macrocycles which are appreciably different: one is clearly the ‘track,’ which would be a rotaxane's axle, and the other is the ‘shuttle,’ or the ring. The authors achieved movement of the shuttle around the track by harnessing biased Brownian motion, combined with the erection or removal of kinetic barriers.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In effect, the track contained a fumarate station and a succinimate station, similar to the system used in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a> (see <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17">ref. 17</a> for the exact molecular structures). The fumarate station had a higher affinity for the benzylic amide shuttle ring as long as it was in its <span class="italic">e</span>-configuration. Photoisomerisation to the <span class="italic">z</span>-configuration lowered this station's affinity by such an amount that the succinimate station on the other side of the track became the shuttle's preferred docking site. However, this station had two serine-derived moieties flanking it, each carrying bulky protecting groups on their hydroxyl groups. These two protecting groups were not identical, but both of them were too large for the shuttle to slide over. Using orthogonal deprotection/reprotection chemistry, one of the kinetic barriers could be temporarily removed, opening the path for the shuttle to slide to its preferred succinimate station. Addition of piperidine allowed the <span class="italic">z</span>-fumarate station to revert to its energetically favourable <span class="italic">e</span>-configuration, and after another round of deprotection/reprotection reactions, the shuttle would slide back to this station. By choosing which protecting group was removed or reattached at which moment, the authors could determine which direction the shuttle would slide towards, achieving directional rotation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In this motor, the fuel spent to achieve locomotion was purely derived from Brownian motion. The energy that the system required from external sources was spent solely on achieving directionality and switching the motion's bias. The motor we describe next takes a green approach to this: it is solar-powered.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> Based on a bis-<span class="italic">p</span>-phenylene-34-crown-10 ring locked on an axle containing a bipyridinium and a dimethyl-bipyridinium station, this rotaxane was stoppered by a conventional stopper on the one side, but by a photosensitising Ru-complex on the other. Intuitively, the ring preferentially docked on the less bulky of the two abovementioned stations. To operate this motor, the photosensitiser would reduce the doubly charged bipyridinium station to a singly charged one. This strongly reduced its affinity for the ring, causing the latter to slide to the now more favourable dimethyl-bipyridinium site. Ingeniously, single electron reduction of this dimethyl-station never occurred due to poorer spectral overlap with the photosensitiser. Finally, as soon as the reduced station would decay back to its original state, the rotaxane's macrocycle diffused back to it, regenerating the original state of this elegant system. The authors calculated that the quantum yield of this sunlight-powered motor was 2%, but they also pointed out that the fuel was free.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The final system described in this section combines aspects of many of the approaches discussed above. Berná <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported an approach to carry a droplet of liquid uphill using nothing but the rotaxanes that covered the incline's surface and a light source.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> Their system was based on a now familiar rotaxane: a benzylamidic macrocycle locked on an axle containing both a succinic and a fumaric station. The fumaric station had the highest affinity for the ring as long as it was in its <span class="italic">e</span>-configuration. Irradiation with UV-light (254 nm) converted the station to its <span class="italic">z</span>-isomer, lowering the station's ability to form energetically favourable hydrogen bonds with the macrocycle, causing the latter to slide towards the more flexible succinamide station. This station, though, was tetrafluorinated. Therefore, irradiation would indirectly lead to the rotaxane effectively becoming less polarophobic, because after irradiation, the macrocycle would slide over the previously solvent-exposed fluorine atoms and shield them from contact with other molecules. These rotaxanes were then physisorbed to a surface, creating a surface with a light-responsive degree of fluorination.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The mechanism of drop transport was based on this degree of fluorination: many solvents are known to be sensitive to surface-bound halogens and adjust their surface tension accordingly. As one side of a drop of diiodomethane and an adjacent section of the unwetted surface was irradiated (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8</a>), that part of the surface eventually came to expose less fluorine. The drop responded by decreasing its contact angle at that side, and it started wetting the less polariphobic surface. To keep up with its extending front, the back of the droplet was continuously forced to decrease its contact angle, up to a point where it was eventually forced to slide towards the front of the droplet to be able to revert to more favourable angles. This shift resulted in a net transport of the droplet. The effect was so pronounced that droplets could even be goaded up a 12° inclined surface covered with these photoresponsive rotaxanes, against the pull of gravity. For this review, this system introduced the concept of sheltering a specific moiety from interactions with its environment by engirdling it with a macrocyclic protective ring. The next chapter will explore this concept in more depth.</p>

If no external scaffolding is present, sometimes multiple bicycles are locked together by a single lock to reduce their mobility. In effect, this common mechanically interlocked architecture of a ring around a stoppered bar regulates access to the bar: whoever controls the lock controls the bicycle. This simple philosophy has found its way into the molecular world as well, where we find demonstrations of rotaxanes with the macrocycle protecting the axle, or with the macrocycle keeping multiple axles in place. This section deals with systems where rotaxane architectures are used to control the location or accessibility of molecules.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect435"><span class="b_heading">3.1 Protective rings</span></h3>
        <span>The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a widely used fluorescent marker, and its success is partially due to its relative stability: a protective β-barrel encases the active fluorophore, shielding it from molecular interactions that may cause its quenching or bleaching. Compared to the encased fluorophore of GFP, squaraines may be even more desirable markers for they are near-IR dyes, enabling several biomedical applications. Unfortunately, the ‘naked’ dye (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9</a>) is inherently susceptible to nucleophilic attack, which leads to loss of the chromophore. Another drawback is its tendency to aggregate in water, which quenches fluorescence. Both of these problems were solved by the group of Smith,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> who encapsulated the cyclobutene core of the squaraine dye inside an amide-containing macrocycle, forming a rotaxane. They found a greatly enhanced stability, which was due to the surrounding macrocycle that sat perfectly over both faces of the electrophilic moiety and blocked nucleophilic attack. That same moiety templated the assembly of the macrocycle, which was formed in one pot from precursor acid chlorides and diamines.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">Increasing the complexity of the system even further, the macrocycle itself had also been upgraded to a version carrying an anthracene diamine instead of a phenyl diamine moiety (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> It is known that anthracenes are able to form endoperoxides, which emit visible light when they revert to their original state.

The resulting complex still had the same useful near-IR fluorescence of the rotaxane dyes described above. Thus, the properties of fluorescence and heat-activated chemiluminescence were combined in a single rotaxane system. Such self-illuminating systems are particularly attractive because no irradiation is necessary, and there is no background emission. Prior chemiluminescence strategies involved short-lived molecular species that had to be generated <span class="italic">in situ</span>, making this a sizeable improvement. Further modifications of this interesting system's macrocycle will be discussed in Section 3.3.

        <p class="otherpara">Other molecules that warrant protection are those that have a biological function that should only act in a highly localised fashion: a protected drug would not only be more stable, it would also be inactive as long as it was protected. For example, opioid growth factor (OGF) is a pentapeptide (YGGFM) that has a certain anti-tumour activity, but also influences pain perception. It would be beneficial if drugs such as this could be made available only in targeted tissues, as opposed to full systemic distribution. The groups of Leigh, Papot and Aucagne collaborated to develop a rotaxane with an OGF-based axle.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> Their synthesis started with a protected YGG that carried an N-terminal galactose stopper attached <span class="italic">via</span> a self-immolative linker. Benzylic amide macrocycles can be assembled around peptides with C-terminal glycines, and this was indeed done here (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10</a> gives a schematic representation using a different axle). Subsequently, the C-terminus was extended by the FM dimer, a bulky sequence that could function as a natural stopper. Upon treatment of this rotaxane with β-galactosidase, the galactose was cleaved from the complex, enabling the subsequent disassembly of the self-immolative linker. Thus, the enzymatic cleavage effectively removed one of the two stoppers, allowing the macrocycle to slide off of the peptide drug, making it biologically available.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> Such a strategy is promising, because antibody-mediated delivery of β-galactosidase is an established prodrug strategy, now granting the same specificity to this rotaxane prodrug.

        <h3 id="sect470"><span class="b_heading">3.2 Valves</span></h3>
        <span>Bicycles offer more analogies with rotaxanes than just locking them up with a chain: their pneumatic tires have compressed air in them, and this air is separated from the atmosphere by a valve. Such a valve may be nothing more than a tube with a little bolt protruding in the middle. A sufficiently large nut that is twisted tight onto this bolt seals the tube. Untwisting the nut reopens the valve. We have seen in the previous section how rotaxane macrocycles can form effective barriers on a molecular scale, and the section on molecular muscles has provided various examples of macrocycles that can be shuttled around an appropriately designed axle. These capabilities have been put to good use in the emulation of macroscopic valves by molecular rotaxane systems.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The first example of this type was reported by the group of Stoddart and Zink.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> They made use of a CBPQT<small><sup>4+</sup></small> macrocycle and an axle featuring a TTF and an NP station, shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11A</a> and similar to the ring and axles shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2A</a>. The axle had two different stoppers, of which one had a functional group that allowed its conjugation to the surface of mesoporous silica particles, in a setup similar to that shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11B</a>. Redox control over the position of the macrocycle thus caused it to be either close to the surface of the particle (valve ‘closed’) or further away from it (valve ‘opened’). It was demonstrated that in the ‘open’ state, a fluorescent iridium complex could diffuse into the pores of the particle, and that a later ‘closing’ of the valves would trap the dye. The closed state functioned as desired: no leakage of trapped dye was observed by fluorescence spectroscopy monitoring as long as the valve remained closed. The addition of ascorbic acid reduced the axle's distant TTF<small><sup>2+</sup></small> station and allowed the macrocycle to slide away from the surface-proximal NP station, opening the valves. An immediate and fast increase in Ir-fluorescence was observed, indicating that trapped molecules were once again free to diffuse into the solution. This nanovalve was based on an established molecular shuttle system, ensuring its reversibility and thus its reusability.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a></p>

        <p class="otherpara">A further development of this concept switched away from redox-responsive rotaxanes, opting to employ pH-sensitive pseudo-rotaxanes instead (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11B</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> After loading mesoporous silica particles with rhodamine B as a model cargo, surface-grafted amino-acetylenes were used in a cucurbit[6]uril-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition to extend the short stalks with a second amine under acidic conditions. This simultaneously trapped the cucurbituril macrocycles because they could not slide over the protonated amines, but they encircled the triazoles upon their formation. Thus, closed valves were created in a self-threading fashion. After washing away of excess reagents, the closed silica particles were assayed and were found to be non-leaking containers for the cargo when short axles were employed. On raising the pH to 10, the amines in the axle were deprotonated, and because there was no stopper on the far end of the axle, the cucurbituril could then freely slide off of its stalk. This opened the valved, and indeed released the cargo into the medium, establishing a nanovalve system that responded to changes in pH. The group of Kim reported an earlier version of this system,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> using a similar strategy and achieving the same goal; their system involved poly(ethylene imine) stalks, and multiple cyclodextrin macrocycles were threaded to close the valves.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An additional form of control was added to this system by Angelos and Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span>, who used a similar setup.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> As an additional feature, the nanopores in their silica particles had their surfaces covered with covalently linked azobenzene moieties. These light-responsive molecules can reversibly and repeatedly switch between <span class="italic">trans</span>- and <span class="italic">cis</span>-conformations when irradiated by specific wavelengths of light. When these so-called nano-impellers were irradiated with 488 nm light, they would undergo a wagging motion, increasing the mobility inside the pores. It was found that merely opening the valve did not lead to the release of cargo molecules, but neither did merely ‘activating’ the nano-impellers. Triggering of both release mechanisms, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> changing both the pH and the light irradiation, was required for cargo release, causing these controlled release particles to exhibit AND-logic responses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Later research by Liu and Du showed that the pH-based trigger for nanovalve opening could be either accelerated or even replaced completely by competition with alternate guest molecules for the cucurbituril.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> Using a cucurbit[7]uril, the addition of varying doses of a C16-alkylated ammonium bromide or a 1,6-hexanediamine shifted the supramolecular equilibrium of cucurbituril inclusion, allowing the opening of the valves even at near-neutral pH. (This competition for inclusion in the macrocycle is possible in these systems because they do not involve true rotaxanes, but pseudo-rotaxanes lacking a terminal stopper.) Combined, the competitor concentration allowed the nanovalves to be opened at any pH value between neutral pH and the same pH 10 that was needed to open the valve without competitors present.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a></p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect500"><span class="b_heading">3.3 Assemblers</span></h3>
        <span>A key step in the synthesis of many different rotaxanes is the moment where the different components assemble. It is either when the preformed macrocycle first threads over its preferred station before all stopper groups are put in place or when the components that will soon form a ring template themselves around a pre-formed axle. By their very nature, rotaxanes are assembled small organic molecules. This power of assembly has been exploited for various purposes. It has been used to enforce assembly of larger molecules, and it has found sensory applications, all of which are covered in this section. A single caveat: some of these systems are not true rotaxanes, but pseudo-rotaxanes. This is because many of the systems described in this section require a dynamic character, which as we will see is one of the advantages that pseudo-rotaxanes can have over actual rotaxanes.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Block copolymers are an important class of polymers, because their asymmetry gives them unique properties. Unfortunately, obtaining block copolymers is not always as trivial as obtaining the separate, unlinked blocks. The group of Fustin has devised a strategy that uses a rotaxane architecture to link separate blocks together in a modular fashion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> Their strategy starts off with a macrocycle carrying a 4-chloro-2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide motif. Through paladium-templating, this macrocycle could thread a singly stoppered axle featuring another pyridine moiety. The non-stoppered end of this axle terminated in an alkyne, so that any azide-terminated polymer block could be conjugated after threading using Cu(<span class="small_caps">I</span>)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). For their proof of concept, they used azido-poly(methyl acrylate) terminated with the same stopper group present on the initially templating axle, thus converting the pseudo-rotaxane to an actual rotaxane. Then, a substitution on the macrocycle's halogen by sodium azide enabled a second round of CuAAC conjugation to attach a second block, acetylene-terminated PEG in this case. The resulting block-copolymer's identity (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12A</a>) was confirmed by MALDI-TOF and size exclusion chromatography. While the authors only achieved roundabout conjugation of an azido-polymer to an alkyne-polymer, they presented a novel concept for block-copolymer formation, and their block copolymers are sure to have interesting but as of yet unexplored inter-block mobility.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a></p>

      <h2 id="sect530"><span class="a_heading">4. Information</span></h2>
      <span>The ability to discretely and reversibly switch between states is the principle on which many current microelectronic devices operate. Logic operations require gates that can give clear outputs of either one state or another and that can switch this output based on dynamically varying inputs. The storage of data requires a material that can similarly be set to 0 or 1 and which then maintains this state for as long as possible to enable a readout of the original setting at a later point in time. As we have seen before in this review and as will be covered in the next section, rotaxanes are outstanding candidates for this behaviour.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect534"><span class="b_heading">4.1 Molecular electronics</span></h3>
        <span>Molecular switch tunnel junctions (MSTJs) are a class of devices where a monolayer of switchable rotaxanes (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14A</a>) is embedded in between two conducting electrodes (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14B</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> Several reports exist where this switchable monolayer was based on a [2]rotaxane featuring the by now well-known CBPQT<small><sup>4+</sup></small> macrocycle on a two-station axle containing a TTF or TTF-like station and an NP station (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14A</a> shows the TTF-like rotaxane). In its ground state (the ground state co-conformation, or GSCC), this bistable rotaxane has its ring positioned predominantly around the TTF station. Electrochemical oxidation of this station to the TTF<small><sup>2+</sup></small> state drives the ring to the NP station, causing the rotaxane to adopt its metastable state co-conformation (MSCC). The electric conductivities of these two states, the GSCC and the MSCC, are not identical. This difference can be detected using the same electrochemistry that can switch the system, only at much lower voltages: by ‘interrogating’ the system with a small test voltage, the resulting current over the MSTJ can be measured. A rotaxane with a high conducting state (hypothesised to be the MSCC)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> will have a low resistance and thus produce a high current. Conversely, a rotaxane in its GSCC will not be as conductive, resulting in a lower current (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14C</a>). By repeating these experiments with just the unthreaded rotaxane's axle, no switchable behaviour was discovered.

        <p class="otherpara">An MSTJ is effectively a gate that can be opened or closed – it can respond to an applied voltage with conductivity or with resistance. This enables their application in logic gates, a fact that was recognised by the group of Heath when they published a pioneering proof of principle using a non-reversible rotaxane switch.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> By linking MSTJs in specific linear arrays, different types of logic gates were obtained, including an AND gate and an OR gate. Expanding the linear arrays to two-dimensional ones, an XOR gate was obtained using the reversible system described above.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> The creation of such molecular logic gates was hypothesised by the authors to have an excellent scalability, because the electronic properties of the solid state devices were very similar to those of the dissolved rotaxanes in dilute solution, implying that the operation of these devices remains similar when fewer molecules populate a junction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The precise molecular structure of these devices has a large influence on their operation. For example, by replacing the TTF station with a quasi-TTF station that has a lower affinity for the CBPQT<small><sup>4+</sup></small> macrocycle, the equilibrium between the GSCC and the MSCC is shifted.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> A more than 1000-fold difference in the relaxation rate was detected when the ring was allowed to slide back to its GSCC, which has many, but mainly negative implications for controlling the power efficiencies of eventual actual devices that employ these molecular switches. Interestingly, in the aforementioned report it was shown that the readout of the electronic device could also be based on the rotaxane's colour, which is green when it is in its GSCC and red when it is in its MSCC.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The two-dimensional arrays mentioned above were so-called crossbar systems, which are systems where multiple inputs are connected to multiple outputs <span class="italic">via</span> a matrix of individual switches. One of the most impressive achievements for rotaxane electronics is a report by Green and Choi and coauthors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> They describe a crossbar system that was made up of 400 16 nm broad silicon wires overlapping 400 similar titanium wires. Each junction contained rotaxanes to form an MSTJ, resulting in a 160 kilobit ‘chip’. The entire circuit had dimensions of 13 × 13 μm, which is so small that no readout system was readily available, causing the researchers to use test electrodes that contacted two to four nanowires at a time. When testing the memory, the researchers performed a massive write of “1” to all bits (they switched the rotaxane from its GSCC to its MSCC) by applying a +1.5 V pulse. A +0.2 V bias was then used to read each bit. Subsequently, a −2.0 V pulse was applied to reset all bits to “0”, and the bits were read once more. It was found that about 50% of the bits responded to this treatment, and that again 50% of those switched beyond a self-imposed threshold value. Bits could be switched up to ten times, and the volatility of the memory (which is a measure of how long data remain stored, so in this system it is the lifetime of the MSCC) was found to be in line with other switchable rotaxanes (medium decay 75 minutes). This was a clear indication that the molecular switching mechanism was the actual basis for the memory. Despite the growing pains described above, this report has set a powerful example of what can be achieved with modern nanotechnology.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> For an in-depth review of the current state of the art concerning similar molecular electronics, we recommend the cited recent review by Coskun and coauthors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Cavallini and coauthors presented an alternative [2]rotaxane-based method for data storage, which technically speaking does not count as molecular electronics because no voltages or currents were involved.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a> Their setup relied on an AFM and its interaction with a dropcast film of rotaxanes for the writing and the readout of the memory. These rotaxanes did not feature multiple stations (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15</a>). Instead, the system relied on interconversion between different rotational isomers of the rotaxane. Molecular modelling of the solid state rotaxane had revealed that two nearly degenerate surfaces existed, between which it was possible to switch with a relatively low activation energy (200.4 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). This energy could be supplied by an AFM tip tracking over the surface with a set point force of slightly more than 2 nN. Due to the peculiarities of nucleation, crystallisation and ripening, a series of dots appeared in response to the perturbation, with a dot size that was related to film thickness. When the AFM tip was tracked over the surface with a set point force lower than 2 nN, no such perturbation of the surface occurred, yet existing dots could be effectively detected. Once more the critical role of the rotaxane architecture was established through experiments where either the macrocycle or the axle was dropcast, and ‘ploughing’ of the AFM tip in the surface was also experimentally ruled out. The authors speculate that data densities of up to 15.5 Gbit per cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> should be possible with this system,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a> which are in the same range as the 100 Gbit cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> that was obtained with the MSTJs described above.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> While the preparation of the memory was much less technically demanding than for the MSTJs, readout by AFM is not as practical as integration in a microelectronic circuit.</p>

        <span>A more esoteric concept of information is the physical principle of knowing the exact location of a particle. However, this is not as distant from everyday life as one might perhaps imagine: the molecular memory chip described above, for example, derives its storage capacity from the ability to maintain and report the location of a particle, with the particle being the macrocycle of a rotaxane. It is digitisation that allows such Boolean knowledge to be converted into more traditional analogue forms. Thus, information regarding the location of a particle can be of fundamental interest.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In equilibrated systems, there is no way of knowing where an individual particular particle might be. For an ideal gas that fills a balloon one knows that all gas particles are inside the balloon, but their individual exact locations can only be described in probabilities. A situation involving less possible states is a [2]rotaxane where the axle features two docking stations with comparable affinities for the resident macrocycle. At a given moment in time, there is no telling on which station an individual cycle will be docked, but one can measure average distributions in terms of what percentage of macrocycles is where. Because the stations have similar affinities, there will be no clear predominance of one station's occupancy over the other.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The group of Leigh has presented a molecular information ratchet that was inspired by these ponderations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> Ratchets are simple yet ingenious mechanical devices where a cogwheel is continuously engaged by a pawl or a tooth, allowing it to rotate in one direction only. The rotaxane ratchet featured a dibenzo-24-crown-8-based macrocycle mechanically locked onto an axle that featured two ammonium stations (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16A</a>). An α-methyl stilbene unit divided the axle into two ‘compartments’: with the stilbene in its <span class="italic">e</span>-isomeric form, the macrocycle could shuttle between the two stations based on Brownian motion. The <span class="italic">z</span>-isomer, on the other hand, was sufficiently bulky to become a de facto stopper group which the macrocycle could not cross, trapping the ring in its current compartment. The stilbene ‘gate’ could thus effectively be ‘opened’ (<span class="italic">e</span>) or ‘closed’ (<span class="italic">z</span>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Stilbene moieties can be switched between their ‘open’ or ‘closed’ states through photon absorption.

        <p class="otherpara">The stilbene ‘gate’ was strategically placed asymmetrically in the axle so that it was much closer to one station (“near”) than to the other (“far”). Because energy transfer efficiency is strongly correlated to distance, the photosensitiser in the macrocycle could only be active when it was on the near station, and it would virtually not be active when the ring was on the far station. Because the sensitiser in the ring had an ‘opening’ effect on the gate, rings on the near station had a high chance of opening the gate and enabling their translocation to the far station. Rings on the far station, though, could no longer open the gate because they could no longer engage in phototransfer. The molecularly dissolved sensitiser predominantly ‘closed’ the gate, and its activity was independent of the position of the ring. Thus, a system was created where rings would automatically slide towards the far compartment without the affinities of the stations being influenced: their movement was ratcheted. In the equilibrium without freely dissolved benzil, 65% of the macrocycles occupied the near gate. Upon addition of one equivalent (compared to the amount of rotaxane) of the ‘closing’ benzil, this occupancy dropped to 58%. By moving up to 5 equivalents of benzil, only 45% of the macrocycles remained on the near station when a new equilibrium was reached. This clearly demonstrated that the equilibrium of the system could be perturbed without altering the system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a></p>

This hydroxyl ‘gate’ could be irreversibly closed by esterification with benzoic acid, which required a 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) type catalyst. It is not chiral as long as it is open, because both gates share equal time with the macrocycle, which is free to slide. Using DMAP, which is small and achiral, no ratcheting effect was observed: after closing the gate, the macrocycles had a 50<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>50 distribution over the two stations as evidenced by <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR (which was enabled by the tactical deuteration of one of the two stations) and chiral HPLC showed a 50<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>50 ratio of (r)/(s).

        <span>Processivity is a widely observed phenomenon in complex enzyme architectures in nature that facilitate the replication and degradation of biopolymers such as DNA and RNA.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> The principle of processivity ensures that the enzyme binds to the substrate and performs several catalytic rounds in a sequential manner before it dissociates from its substrate. The polymerases and λ-exonucleases that are responsible for DNA replication and degradation, respectively, embody the principles of processivity. Interestingly, these complex systems bear a rotaxane-like structure in which a long biomacromolecule is threaded through a protein macrocycle. In order to mimic these complex architectures found in nature by using synthetic rotaxanes, the challenge is the introduction of processivity to these small artificial molecular machines.</span>

The catalytic part, which was located on the macrocycle, was a tethered thiol group. The thread contained terminal blocking groups that prevented the sliding off of the macrocycle before the peptide synthesis could be completed. It also contained three amino acid building blocks, which were attached to the thread by weak phenolic ester linkages (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18A</a>).

        <p class="otherpara">An interesting question is now how the porphyrin catalyst finds the end of the polymer chain and threads on it. To elucidate this, threading studies were carried out with porphyrin clip <strong>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-1</strong> and a series of polymers. A polytetrahydrofuran chain (<strong>2</strong>) was equipped with an <span class="italic">N</span>,<span class="italic">N</span>′-dialkyl-4,4′-bipyridinium (viologen) unit, which is a ‘trap’ (a station with a high binding affinity) for the porphyrin, and with a bulky phenyl-based group that acted as a stopper (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19B</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> Fluorescence was found to be a sensitive tool to investigate the kinetics of the threading process: <strong>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-1</strong> is a fluorescent molecule and its fluorescence is fully quenched once it docks onto the viologen moiety.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Studies showed that the fluorescence quenching only occurs when the viologen bound to the porphyrin inside the cavity (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20</a>). The rate constants for threading and dethreading (<span class="italic">k</span><small><sub>on</sub></small> and <span class="italic">k</span><small><sub>off</sub></small>) and the corresponding free energy values (Δ<span class="italic">G</span><small><sup>≠</sup></small><small><sub>on</sub></small> and Δ<span class="italic">G</span><small><sup>≠</sup></small><small><sub>off</sub></small>) were determined by monitoring the fluorescence emission intensity as a function of time. Studies revealed that the threading was a second-order process while dethreading followed first-order kinetics. It was also found that sufficient energy and the right orientation and conformation of the polymer chains are needed for the threading to fully occur. Furthermore, temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the entropic values of activation were strongly negative for all polymers and that the absolute value of the entropy of activation was found to increase with the length of the polymer chain, which is in line with an earlier proposed nucleation mechanism for threading. By measuring the rate of the threading (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the rate of fluorescence quenching as a result of binding) as a function of the length of the polymers, the speed of the movement could be roughly estimated.

        <p class="otherpara">It was concluded that the threading mechanism of the polymeric chains could be described by a consecutive-hopping mechanism.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> In this model, initial binding is a second-order process and is described by a rate constant ‘<span class="italic">k</span><small><sub>initial</sub></small>’ which is independent of the chain length; thus entanglements do not play a role in the initial binding process in the present case. The macrocycle travels the whole chain, ultimately reaching the viologen trap where fluorescence is then quenched. The macrocycle can subsequently dissociate and return to sliding along the chain (<span class="italic">k</span><small><sub>v-off</sub></small>). In the consecutive-hopping mechanism the speed of movement (<span class="italic">k</span><small><sub>hop</sub></small>) and the dynamics of translocation are not specified. Computed curves led to the grey line in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21A</a> which depicts a good fit for the polymeric chains. The theoretical model describes the basics of the threading as well as the temperature dependency of the process; however it was not sufficient to describe the nonlinear trend in the rates of threading among the short chains and oligomers. To explain the different trend in the rates, the consecutive-hopping mechanism was combined with the so called ‘entron effect’ which suggests that a minimum number of atoms (entrons) in the chain are needed to fill the cavity of the macrocycle and that this is followed by the movement of the macrocycle through a hopping mechanism. According to this theory, 5 atoms are needed to initially fill the cavity. The predicted curve for rate constants as a function of number of atoms in the chain derived by using the new equation was found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental findings especially for <strong>H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-1</strong> (black line in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21A</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> The second region (8–22), where the rate remains constant, was described by an intramolecular threading mechanism. This mechanism held that threading is initiated by the interactions between the viologen and the macrocycle outside of the cage, leading to accelerated rates (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> lowering the transition state energy and energetically forcing the process downhill toward the viologen trap) by means of transition state stabilisation. For the chains bearing 8 and more atoms (8–22), the viologen trap binds to the macrocycle from outside and the open end of the chain subsequently loops inside the cavity like a dog biting its own tail. Interestingly, in this case there is a driving force for the macrocycle to move along the polymer chain, namely the fact that the size of the folded ring, which is formed between the macrocycle and the polymer chain, becomes smaller when the threading process proceeds. The formation of the viologen–macrocycle complex from the outside facilitates the process like a ring closure reaction; when the loop becomes too small at the last 8 atoms (C<small><sub>c*</sub></small> in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21B</a>), the viologen dissociates from the macrocycle and the last 8 atoms enter the cavity in a normal fashion. This implies that the insertion of the last 8 atoms of the polymer is rate-limiting, which is in agreement with the experimental data showing that the observed rates for chains with number of atoms between 8 and 22 are almost the same.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">This artificial system of threading a macromolecule through a hole is reminiscent of natural translocation systems in which initial interactions between a biopolymer protein and a receptor in the vicinity of the pore play an important role. Another natural system is that where clamp proteins encircle DNA, adopting a rotaxane-like configuration. Enzymes that associate with such a clamp automatically also associate with the DNA and can slide over it through the mobility of the clamp. These clamp–enzyme interactions enhance the processive behaviour of many DNA polymerases, such as that of the T4 bacteriophage.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> Clerx and van Dongen <span class="italic">et al.</span> have recently reported a mutated T4 clamp protein that was conjugated to an artificial catalyst: a manganese tripyridyl porphyrin that selectively oxidises the backbone of DNA after or before any AAA sequence. The resulting bio-hybrid catalyst could thus slide over DNA to nick it after specific sequences only, resembling an artificial endonuclease.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The T4 clamp protein is trimeric and by itself it does not form a perfect circle because one of the subunit interfaces remains ‘open’ in solution. It is through this open interface that the clamp protein loads onto DNA. Once loaded, the C-terminus of the T4 DNA polymerase docks into this open interface, simultaneously closing up the ring and binding the polymerase to its template. The authors employed a peptide analogue of this C-terminus in an attempt to also complete the circle for their catalytic clamp. They found that the peptide indeed closed the open interface, and that this closed circle could no longer load onto DNA (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22</a>). Thus, the peptide allowed control over the processivity of the catalytic clamp: without it, the clamp could load onto DNA to perform processive catalysis, but no complex-formation was possible in its presence. It is unfortunate that the peptide apparently could not lock the clamp protein onto the DNA after complexation had already occurred. As an additional feature, a dedicated clamp-loading enzyme was used. In nature, this clamp-loader bootstraps the loading of the clamp onto specific clamp-loading sites. By pairing both proteins with a DNA template containing appropriately designed clamp-loading sites, the sliding direction of the catalytic clamp could be controlled. Thus, this report demonstrates that naturally occurring rotaxane-like processivity factors can be used to confer processivity to artificial catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a></p>

      <span>Slowly but surely, mechanically interlocked architectures are starting to fulfil their promise as addressable components in all kinds of nanosystems that benefit from controlled motion between two or more defined states. On the waves of the nanotechnology revolution and the concomitant developments in new characterisation methods, such as scanning probe and fluorescence microscopy, unique insights into the working mechanisms of interlocked molecules are being obtained, even on the single molecule level. There is little doubt that this deeper understanding will lead to improvements in their molecular design and functionality. In addition, the gradual merging of the physical, chemical, and biological disciplines in the past decade has opened the way to a wealth of new opportunities to implement interlocked systems into new, hybrid materials and devices. It is here that the most exciting developments might be expected: by employing metallic or semiconductor scaffolds on which millions of interlocked molecules can make their movements cooperatively to create responsive materials on a macroscopic scale, and by taking nature as a blueprint to mimic processive enzymes, constructing a new generation of efficient catalysts.</span>
