Carbon dot (CD) is the youngest member of the carbon based nanomaterials family but it has emerged as the brightest in recent times, as now it is one of the most intensive research topics in the domain of materials science. The popularity is due to its excellent aqueous dispersibility, functionality, biocompatibility and ease of preparation from different carbon based resources. All such favorable attributes help CDs to find applications in the fields of optoelectronic, energy conversion, bio-imaging, drug delivery, sensors, catalysis, etc. Most recently, CD–metal based nanohybrids have been extensively employed for several photochemical and electrochemical applications due to their unique and interesting up-conversion photoluminescence and photo-induced electron/charge transfer properties. Therefore, the recent progress of CD–metal based nanohybrids in such applications needs to be compiled in the form of a review for highlighting their benefits to researchers in this field. In the present review, hence, fabrication methods, structural characterizations, properties and applications of CD–metal based nanohybrids are highlighted in a concise but systematic way to cover the desired information. Different photochemical and electrochemical applications like photocatalysis, solar cell or photovoltaic, energy storage, and photochemical and electrochemical sensors of the CD–metal based nanohybrids are focused in this article. This review thus tries to provide a decent and updated coverage on the topic.

His current research interest includes the synthesis of bio-based hyperbranched polymers, nanomaterials including carbon based nanohybrids and polymer nanocomposites for their different potential advanced applications.

Over the last two decades carbon based nanomaterials are gaining significant interest both in academic and industrial scenarios. A number of studies have been reported in the literature on different aspects of carbon based nanomaterials including fullerene as zero-dimensional, multi-walled/single-walled carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanofibers as one-dimensional, and graphene, graphene oxide, and reduced graphene oxide as two-dimensional materials. Recently, carbon quantum dots (also known as carbon dots, C-dots, CDs or CQDs) have emerged as a new class of attractive zero-dimensional nanomaterial in the carbon family. It is one of the youngest but the brightest nanomaterials in the carbon family. CD was first noticed accidentally by Xu et al. during the purification of single-walled carbon nanotubes in 2004. It was discovered by them while separating single-walled carbon nanotubes using gel electrophoresis from carbon soot produced by arc discharge. At that time it was named fluorescent carbon. Subsequently, Sun et al. synthesized similar fluorescent carbon nanoparticles with diameter less than 10 nm and the product was named as carbon dot (CD). The size range of this oxygenous carbon nanoparticle quantum dot lies within 10 nm and was popularized as carbon or carbogenic or carbon quantum/nanodot in the literature. It is superior to other semiconductor based inorganic quantum dots in terms of its easy and fast aqueous dispersibility, polar functionality, low toxicity, production simplicity, etc. It possesses fascinating physical, chemical, biological and optical properties, which make it an attractive material in the fields of biomedical science, sensors, optoelectronics, photocatalysis, energy devices and so on. However, subsequent research clearly demonstrated that the photoluminescence (PL) characteristic of CDs can be quenched efficiently either by electron acceptor or by electron donor molecules in solution. This result clearly indicates that photoexcited CDs can act as an excellent electron donor as well as an electron acceptor. This interesting photoinduced electron transfer ability of CDs offers exciting opportunities for them in light energy conversion devices and in photocatalysis. Current research further indicated that CD–metal based nanohybrids can dominate the fields of photochemical and electrochemical devices due to their interesting up- and down-conversion PL characteristics as well as electron or charge transport properties. These hybrid nanomaterials thus find potential applications in the fields of photochemistry and electrochemistry including photocatalysis, solar cells or photovoltaics, sensors, and energy storage. Most interestingly, over the last few years although several reviews have been published on the synthesis, characterization, properties and applications (mainly biological and photocatalysis) of CDs, such reviews have not discussed CD–metal based nanohybrids for photochemical and electrochemical applications. The present article, therefore, mainly reviews the preparation, characterization, properties and applications confined to the photochemical and electrochemical fields of CD–metal based nanohybrids to provide an updated coverage on the topic to researchers in the field.


CDs are prepared by using both top-down and bottom-up approaches. In the top-down method, CDs are prepared by breaking large carbon clusters through chemical oxidation or by physical cleavage. On the other hand, in the bottom-up approach CDs are prepared by using different carbon based precursors through a series of chemical reactions to form nanoscale fluorescent particles. Various preparative techniques of CDs by top-down and bottom-up approaches are schematically shown in Fig. 1.


The top-down approach for the preparation of CDs mainly includes arc-discharge, laser ablation, electrochemical or strong acid oxidation. The first synthesis process used for the preparation of CDs was arc discharge. CDs were produced during the purification of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) obtained from carbon soot by the arc discharge process. Carbon soot is oxidized with nitric acid (to improve its hydrophilicity) followed by separation of SWCNTs by the electrophoretic method to produce CDs. Actually, in this arc discharge process, two new classes of nanomaterials are produced from the crude soot. One of them is the short, tubular carbon nanotubes, while the other one is a mixture of fluorescent carbon nanoparticles or CDs. CDs are also prepared by laser ablation of a carbon target in the presence of water vapor with argon as the carrier gas followed by surface passivation by attaching simple organic species. This carbon target is prepared by hot-pressing of a mixture of graphite powder and cement, followed by stepwise baking, curing, and finally annealing under an argon atmosphere. However, researchers used different carbon based materials such as graphite, nano-carbons, etc. to prepare CDs by the laser ablation method. The electrochemical oxidation method is also used to prepare CDs using graphite as the working electrode along with platinum (Pt) as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in different aqueous electrolytes, like NaH2PO4, phosphate buffer, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, etc. Researchers also used a strong acid based oxidation method, where different types of carbon soots obtained from burning candles, combustion chambers, etc. were oxidized by strong nitric acid to produce CDs. In all these processes CDs of different sizes are commonly separated by a high-speed centrifugation technique using a water–ethanol–chloroform solvent mixture. However, these top-down methods suffer from several drawbacks including the necessity for a series of experiments, need for strong acids or electrolytes, and surface passivating agents for the improvement of fluorescence properties.


To address the drawbacks of top-down methods, researchers attempted to prepare CDs through different bottom-up approaches. These approaches are mainly established for polymerization reactions followed by carbonization of small organic molecules for the formation of quantum size CDs. Hydrothermal, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, ultrasonic, pyrolysis, and dehydration/direct heating methods are included in this approach. Carbon containing molecules such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, ascorbic acid, chitosan, glycerol, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, etc. are used as carbon based precursors for the preparation of CDs by the above methods. Some inexpensive bio-precursors are also reported for the preparation of biocompatible water soluble fluorescent CDs by this approach. Hydrothermal treatment is the most facile and self-passivation based one pot method for the preparation of water soluble fluorescent CDs containing a large number of oxygenous groups. In this method, carbonization of small organic molecules takes place at elevated temperature (150–200 °C) and pressure in the presence of water. In this vein, a microwave method has also been developed to prepare CDs using carbohydrates as a carbon source and PEG200 as both the solvent and coating agent. The reaction medium is irradiated using a 500 W microwave power for 2–10 min and the reaction medium gradually transforms to dark brown from a colorless solution. Similarly, an ultrasonic method has also been developed for the preparation of CDs. It is a simple approach for the large-scale synthesis of water-soluble green carbon nanodots from different kinds of food waste-derived carbon resources. Again, Lai et al. synthesized highly emissive CDs by the pyrolysis of glycerol under reflux (∼230 °C, 1 atmosphere air pressure) conditions for 30 min. In this work, the researchers also prepared PEG-modified CDs using the same procedure. Amphiphilic CDs have also been prepared by Wang et al. using low-cost, natural, edible chicken eggs by a plasma-induced pyrolytic technique. These CDs are highly soluble in a broad range of solvents from aqueous to organic, and also resistant to acids and bases. However, the recent trend to prepare CDs is mainly based on bio-precursors, like orange juice, banana juice, strawberry juice, sugarcane juice, chicken egg, oatmeal, silkworm, waste paper, waste food,etc. In this milieu, we have also developed a simple synthesis protocol to produce water soluble fluorescent CDs by direct heating of commercially available relatively low cost bio-based raw materials like banana juice, Colocasia esculenta extract, glycerol, citric acid, etc. in aqueous medium.

It is pertinent to mention here that in all these bottom-up approaches, the basic mechanism of formation of CDs is the same. It follows hydrolysis, dehydration and decomposition of different carbon precursors under suitable conditions and results in soluble compounds like furfural aldehydes, ketones and several organic acids like acetic, levulinic, formic, etc. The aromatization and carbonization of these products take place through polymerization, condensation and cycloaddition reactions in the subsequent steps. In the final step, CDs are formed from the aromatic clusters at a critical concentration of super-saturation point.

CD–metal based nanohybrids are mainly prepared by three basic approaches, physical mixing technique, chemical reduction technique and hydrothermal/solvothermal method.


In this approach CD–metal based nanohybrids are mainly prepared through the mixing of a solution of CDs with a dispersion of metal nanoparticles by mechanical shearing followed by sonication. Li et al. prepared a TiO2/CD nanohybrid by adding a TiO2 nanoparticles dispersion into the aqueous solution of CDs under constant stirring for 10 min followed by vacuum drying at 80 °C for 12 h. The same group also prepared a Cu2O/CD nanohybrid using an ultrasonic method. Bhattacharya et al. prepared hybrid nanostructured CDs decorated Fe3O4 by ultrasonic treatment. The solid Fe3O4 nanospheres are dispersed in aqueous solution of ‘as-prepared’ CDs using ultrasonication for 30 min. The mixture is then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h and finally the product is washed with ethanol followed by distilled water several times and finally dried at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain the desired nanohybrid. On the other hand, Tang et al. prepared CD/monoclinic BiVO4 nanosphere and nanoplatelet hybrids by refluxing a dispersion of BiVO4 powder inaqueous solution of CDs at 90 °C for 3 h. Mondal et al. reported a gold/CD nanohybrid using anisotropic gold nanospecies (GNS) in buffer medium in the presence of CTAB. These GNS are conjugated with long chain anionic carboxylate functionalized CDs by blending the mixture in phosphate buffer solution at different ratios, as shown in Fig. 2a. Similarly, Tian et al. prepared CD/hydrogenated TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures by simply refluxing H-TiO2 nanobelts in aqueous solution of CDs at 90 °C for 3 h. The obtained nanohybrid was washed with water followed by drying in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Yu et al. reported a nanohybrid of CD/TiO2 nanosheets, prepared through a simple low temperature process, in which TiO2 nanosheets are dispersed in aqueous solution of CDs followed by drying at 60 °C overnight. But Muthulingam et al. fabricated a carbon quantum dots/N-doped zinc oxide (N-ZnO) nanohybrid only by stirring at room temperature in ethanol. Briscoe et al. reported CDs coated ZnO nanorods by soaking the ZnO nanorods in ethanol solution of CDs for 24 h followed by rinsing with ethanol to remove the poorly adhered CDs.

However, due to the presence of poor interactions between the metal nanoparticles and CDs in the nanohybrids obtained by the physical mixing technique, currently, researchers are using chemical reduction and hydrothermal techniques to prepare various kinds of CD–metal based nanohybrids as alternative methods.

In this technique metal based nanoparticles are prepared using CDs as the reducing agent. Actually, a large number of peripheral oxygen containing groups like hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic acid and epoxy groups of CDs are capable of reducing metal ions to metals by transferring electrons. The important advantage of this reduction technique is that CDs can also act as a stabilizing agent during the formation of metal based nanoparticles due to the presence of these oxygenous polar functional groups on their surface. Therefore, in most of the cases the growth of metal nanoparticles starts on the surface of CDs to form the nanohybrid. In 2011, Mitra et al. utilized CDs for the first time as the reducing agent to prepare Au and Ag nanoparticles from their corresponding salts in the presence of PEG under microwave irradiation. Similarly, carbon-dot-supported silver nanoparticles are prepared by using CDs as the reducing agent for the reduction of silver ions under ultraviolet irradiation. In this reduction reaction, electrons are transferred to Ag+ ions from photo-excited CDs under UV light and the color of the solution is changed from yellow to dark brown, which indicates the conversion of Ag+ ions to silver nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 2b. Shen et al. utilized CDs for the direct reduction of Ag+ to elemental silver (Ag0) by incubating Ag+ with CDs for 5 min in a water bath at 50 °C. Ag-nanoparticles are simultaneously formed with an average size of 3.1 ± 1.5 nm and decorated on the surface of CDs. In this process, the oxidation of amine or phenolic hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring of CDs takes place and at the same time CDs protect and stabilize the Ag-nanoparticles from aggregation in aqueous medium, as shown in Fig. 2c. The prepared Ag-nanoparticles are stable at least for 45 days in aqueous medium. The researchers also prepared Au-nanoparticles by heating aqueous solution of CDs and HAuCl4 at 70 °C in a water bath for 10 min. Here also Au-nanoparticles are formed on the surface of CDs. Dey et al. reported CD reduced palladium nanoparticles, where CDs acted as a reducing as well as stabilizing agent for the synthesis of Pd nanoparticles. The surface hydroxyl, carboxylic and epoxy groups of CDs acted as the nucleation centers for the growth of Pd nanoparticles and CDs formed a thin shielding layer around the surface of Pd nanoparticles. In our previous report, a CD/Cu2O nanohybrid was prepared by simple reduction of CuSO4 solution by CDs at 70 °C in the presence of ammonia. In this reduction process also CDs acted as a reducing as well as capping agent, and mainly the peripheral polar groups such as hydroxyl and aldehyde of CDs helped to reduce Cu2+ to Cu+. The hydroxyl groups reduced Cu2+ by a polyphenolic mechanism and the aldehyde groups reduced Cu2+ by a Benedict reaction mechanism (the color of the solution changes to reddish brown after addition of the Cu2+ salt due to the formation of Cu2O). On the other hand, Gao et al. employed poly(amido amine) dendrimers capped-CDs as the reducing and capping agents for the preparation of a CD/Au nanohybrid and the reaction was performed at 100 °C for 2 h under constant stirring. Recently, Zhuo et al. utilized reduced-CDs as the reducing agent for the preparation of metal clusters. It is observed that reduced CDs exhibited excellent electron-donating capability thereby facilitating the fast reduction of metal ions to the corresponding metal nanoclusters or nanoparticles. Subsequently, other researchers also utilized CDs as the reducing agent for the preparation of various metal based nanohybrids.


Currently, this is the most widely used approach for the facile and one pot preparation of CD–metal based nanohybrids. In this technique, nanohybrids are prepared by the mixing of aqueous solution of the metals salts with either CDs or carbon precursors of CDs before performing the required hydro/solvothermal treatment. This technique is mainly used to achieve controlled size and shape of the nanohybrids as well as to establish strong interactions between the metal nanoparticles and CDs. Zhang et al. reported a facile fabrication of a Fe2O3/CD nanohybrid by a hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C using aqueous solution of FeCl3·6H2O and (NH2)2CO in the presence of CDs. It is observed that the dust color of CDs completely disappears in the resultant solution thereby confirming the formation of the Fe2O3/CD nanohybrid. On the other hand, Yu et al. prepared a CD/TiO2 nanohybrid by a solvothermal reaction at 140 °C for 4 h. Before the desired solvothermal reaction, TiO2 and CDs (with different ratios) are mixed together to obtain a homogeneous suspension in an aqueous ethanolic solvent by continuous stirring. Finally, the nanohybrid is collected by centrifugation followed by washing three times with distilled water prior to drying under vacuum at 40 °C overnight. Tang et al. reported the preparation of a CD/NiFe layered double-hydroxide nanohybrid by a solvothermal reaction, performed at 120 °C for 12 h followed by heating at 160 °C for 2 h in aqueous DMF (1:2 v/v, DMF:water). In this process first CDs are dispersed in DMF by sonication followed by mixing with aqueous solution of nickel acetate [Ni(OAc)2] and ferric nitrate [Fe(NO3)3] by vigorous stirring at 85 °C for 4 h. Finally, the product is collected by centrifugation after repeated washing with water and lyophilization. Wang et al. prepared a series of well-interfaced TiO2/CD nanohybrids from bidentate complexes of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanowires with vitamin-C by a simple hydrothermal process, carried out at 90 °C for 4 h. In this method, TiO2 is first dispersed in aqueous solution of vitamin-C by mechanical stirring, so that vitamin-C can be favorably anchored at the TiO2 surfaces due to the reaction between titanium ions and ortho-substituted hydroxyl groups of vitamin-C. As a result, the in situ transformed CD particles from vitamin-C are firmly attached to TiO2 and form benign interfaces between the two components by ultimate chemically coupled heterostructures, as shown in Fig. 2d. On the other hand, Zhang et al. prepared a nitrogen doped CD (NCD)/TiO2 nanohybrid by mixing NCDs with aqueous solution of TiCl3 and NaCl under stirring followed by performing a hydrothermal reaction at 100 °C for 12 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. However, Saud et al. fabricated CDs anchored TiO2 nanofibers by solvothermal treatment at 140 °C for 4 h after mixing TiO2 nanofibers and CDs in a mixed solvent of water and ethanol by stirring at room temperature. In our recent report, a CD–TiO2 nanohybrid has been prepared through a facile in situ hydrothermal technique, where aqueous solutions of citric acid and glycerol as the precursors of CDs are mixed with titanium butoxide as the precursor of TiO2 in the first step. This mixture is heated at 150 °C for 8 h in a muffle furnace after transferring into a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave. In another report, Zhu et al. synthesized a CDs decorated NiCo2O4 nanohybrid by a solvothermal treatment at 180 °C for 3 h using CDs, Ni(Ac)2·4H2O and Co(Ac)2·4H2O in an ethylene glycol solvent in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone). Recently, Ming et al. fabricated a dandelion-like ZnS/CD nanohybrid by a facile hydrothermal treatment, performed at 90 °C for 3 h. First dandelion-like ZnS is dispersed in deionized water containing CDs followed by refluxing in an oil bath to obtain the desired nanohybrid. Thus various types of CD–metal based nanohybrids are obtained under different conditions using different metal based precursors.


Generally, CD is a 2–10 nm size nanoparticle consisting of a sp2 hybridized graphitic core functionalized with polar oxygenous groups. In the UV-Vis absorption spectrum, two types of absorbance peaks are observed at around 235–240 nm and 280–320 nm due to the π–π* transition of sp2 core carbon and n–π* transition of carbonyl functional groups of CDs. From FT-IR analyses it is found that CDs mainly contain oxygenous functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic acid, and epoxy on their surface. Generally, from the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 3a) of CDs, the stretching vibrations are found at 3492, 2935, 1730, 1625, 1422, 1264 and 918 cm−1, due to the presence of –OH, C–H, CO, CC, C–O–C, C–O and epoxy linkages, respectively. XPS spectral analysis confirmed the presence of basic elements like carbon and oxygen in the structure of CDs, as the peaks at 384 and 532 eV indicate the binding energy of these elements (Fig. 3b). The high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s revealed the presence of C–C, CC, CO, C–O, C–OH in the structure of CDs. However, researchers have also reported nitrogen containing groups in CDs, which may appear due to the use of nitrogen containing precursors and/or doping or functionalizing agents in CDs. As an example, Zhang et al. synthesized N-doped CDs from CCl4 and NaNH2. The high resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s confirmed the presence of C–C, CN and C–N bonds, whereas the spectrum of N 1s core level electrons detected the presence of nitrogen in graphitic-, pyridinic-, and pyrrolic-like structures, as well as in N–H groups. The typical peaks at 284.4, 285.1, 286.0, and 287.6 eV are also found in the deconvoluted C 1s XPS spectrum, which are attributed to the graphitic CC and C–C, C–N, C–O and CO, respectively as shown in Fig. 3c. The typical peaks at 389.9, 399.6 and 400.6 eV in the N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d) reveal the presence of three different types of nitrides: pyridinic, pyrrolic, and N–H types. Again, from XRD, SAED and HR-TEM analyses, it is found that CDs are an amorphous to poorly crystalline nanomaterial. The graphitic (100) and (002) spacing of CDs synthesized by different approaches are found at around 0.2–0.23 and 0.32–0.34 nm respectively, from HR-TEM images, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The spacing of 0.33–0.41 nm of CDs for the (002) plane is also found in the XRD pattern (Fig. 3e) depending on preparative approaches. With the increase of the number of polar functional groups on the surface, the amorphous nature of CDs is increased and thus the d-spacing also increases. The Raman spectrum (Fig. 3f) of CDs obtained from different procedures using various carbon precursors showed the graphitic D and G bands at around 1300–1400 and 1500–1600 cm−1, respectively. However, the intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG), which is a measure of the extent of disorder and the ratio of sp3/sp2 carbon, is found to be more than 0.50 and is larger than that of graphite (always <0.50). This is due to the structural defects in CDs that arise from the presence of oxygenous groups (C–O, CO, O–CO) on the surface of CDs. Thus, the sp2 carbon site, vacant lattice sites and sp3 site are detected in the structure of CDs.

On the other hand, the structural morphology of the CD–metal based nanohybrid system mainly depends on the preparative approaches and the conditions used. The CD nanoparticles are always attached to metal based nanoparticles by physical interactions in the nanohybrids, obtained through the physical mixing technique. Fig. 4c and d show the surface protruding structures of the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid prepared by the ultrasonic method.Fig. 4e depicts the presence of good interactions in the constructed nanohybrid, where CDs are deposited on the surface of Cu2O. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 4f) of the nanohybrid shows lattice spacing of 0.25 nm and 0.32 nm, which correspond to the crystallographic (111) plane of Cu2O and (002) plane of CDs, which demonstrate that the CD particles are successfully loaded on the surface of Cu2O particles. This structure is further confirmed by EDS elemental mapping as shown in Fig. 4h–j. Fig. 5a shows the TEM images of CD/hydrogenated TiO2 nanobelt heterostructures. From this figure it is clear that the heterostructures retained the one-dimensional morphology after refluxing and the surface of the TiO2 nanobelts is homogeneously covered with a layer of dense CDs. Two different inter-planar spacing of 0.354 and 0.325 nm are observed from the HR-TEM image (Fig. 5b), which correspond to the (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 and the (002) crystal plane of graphite, respectively. Here, the surface-coarsened H-TiO2 nanobelts have a large specific surface area and thus provide numerous nucleation sites for the growth of CDs. Therefore, a large number of spherical CDs assembled on the surface of H-TiO2 nanobelts and retained the one-dimensional morphology of the heterostructure.
However, the growth of the metal nanoparticles start on the surface of CDs for the nanohybrids obtained through the chemical reduction technique, as the oxygenating functional groups of CDs take part in the reduction of metal ions. A representative HR-TEM image of CD–Ag nanoparticles is presented in Fig. 5c, as reported by Choi et al. Two types of lattice fringes are found in this image at 3.2 Å and 2.1 Å, which correspond to the (002) plane of CDs and (100) plane of Ag nanoparticles, respectively. The image also shows that the Ag nanoparticles are formed on the surface of CDs. Dey et al. prepared CDs reduced palladium, where a Pd@CD nanohybrid is formed by the deposition of an ultrathin CD layer of ca. 3.8 nm with Pd nanoparticles. From the TEM image (Fig. 5d), it is observed that each nanohybrid particle had a low contrast shell of continuous CD layers wrapping a high contrast Pd core, confirming the core–shell structure formation. Here, the growth of the Pd nanoparticles is initiated on the CD surface, as the Pd nanoparticles appeared to form chain-like structures embedded within a carbon matrix.
However, in the hydro/solvothermal technique CD particles are always attached to the metal surface, which is generally in contrast to the chemical reduction technique. Fig. 5(e–h) show the typical TEM images of the CD/TiO2 nanohybrid prepared by Wang et al. using a hydrothermal reaction.Fig. 5e clearly shows that an individual CD with a distinguished interplanar spacing of 0.342 nm is closely attached onto an anatase TiO2 nanoparticle surface (interplanar spacing of 0.355 nm), whereas from Fig. 5f it is observed that several CD nanoparticles (red circled area; interplanar spacing of 0.342 nm) adhere to the surfaces of the TiO2 nanowires. Here, after hydrothermal treatment, in situ transformed CD nanoparticles are immobilized on the surface of TiO2, producing the desired CD/TiO2 nanohybrid. Saud et al. prepared CDs anchored TiO2 nanofibers by solvothermal treatment, in which CDs are distinctly decorated on the surface of TiO2 nanofibers, as shown in TEM images (Fig. 5g and h). A dandelion-like ZnS/CD nanohybrid was prepared by Ming et al. using a low temperature hydrothermal reaction, as stated earlier. These dandelion-like ZnS are assembled by plenty of nanowires (diameter, ∼10 nm) in the hybrid nanostructure and the dark dots are distributed on the wires, implying that CD nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of the dandelion-like ZnS.
Further, FT-IR analysis of CD–metal based nanohybrids predicts the possible interactions between CDs and metal after the formation of nanohybrids. Wei et al. fabricated a CD/Ni–Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanohybrid through a hydrothermal reaction, in which pure CDs show peaks at about 3455 (–OH), 1630 (CO), 1386 (CC), and 1108 cm−1 (epoxide/ether C–O–C) in the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 6a). Pure NiAl-LDH shows a broad peak centered at about 3450 cm−1, which corresponds to the –OH stretching vibration of water molecules that exist in the interlayer and H-bonded –OH groups, accompanied by the bending mode at 1633 cm−1. The spectrum also shows a series of absorbance bands in the range of 1500–1300 cm−1 and the minor peak at 1000 cm−1 is due to the stretching mode of carbonate (CO32−). Other absorption bands below 800 cm−1 are assigned to metal–oxygen (M–O) stretching in the lattice, whereas, in the FT-IR spectrum of the CD/NiAl-LDH nanohybrid some dominant peaks show a slight shift. For example, the CO peak showed a ∼35 cm−1 red shift probably due to the strong electrostatic interactions between NiAl-LDH and CDs or the formation of a chemical bond C–O–Ni/Al. This crucial result indicates that not only physical adsorption but stronger interactions may also exist between CDs and NiAl-LDH.
The surface electronic states of the nanohybrids are studied from XPS analysis. The XPS spectrum (Fig. 7a) of the above-mentioned CD/NiAl-LDH nanohybrid shows the compositional analysis of Ni, Al and O stemming from pristine NiAl-LDH. The C peaks corresponding to CDs (content: ∼17%) can be distinctly detected in the CD/NiAl-LDH complex. In Fig. 7c, the dominant peak at 284.5 eV corresponds to the non-oxygenated ring C (C–C), along with two peaks at 286.6 and 288.8 eV corresponding to the oxygen single-bonded carbon (C–O) and carboxylic acid (O–CO), which are in agreement with the FT-IR results as mentioned above. In addition, the peaks corresponding to Al, Ni 2p3/2, and Ni 2p1/2 (Fig. 7b and d) also confirm the presence of NiAl-LDH in the nanohybrid. The surface area and the porous structure of the CD–metal based nanohybrids are analyzed by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements. Owing to the addition of CDs, the size of NiAl-LDH crystals becomes smaller and more exposed. Thus, the surface area of 77.9 m2 g−1 for the CD/NiAl-LDH composite is much higher than 24.1 m2 g−1 for pure LDH as shown in Fig. 7e and f. On the basis of the pore size distribution plot, two sizes of 2.4 and 7.1 nm can be observed indicating that the CD/NiAl-LDH composite is distinctive because of the existence of a well-defined mesoporous structure, which may be attributed to its internal voids and inter-particle spacing. Di et al. also analyzed the surface area of the CDs modified Bi2MoO6 (CD/Bi2MoO6) nanohybrid by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements as shown in Fig. 8a. The specific surface area of the pure Bi2MoO6 material is found to be 6.08 m2 g−1. However, with the incorporation of CDs into Bi2MoO6, the specific surface area increased gradually and was found to be 8.68 m2 g−1, 9.54 m2 g−1, 16.57 m2 g−1, and 22.39 m2 g−1 for 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt%, and 4 wt% CDs modified nanohybrids, respectively. Di et al. also analyzed the surface area of the CD/BiOCl nanohybrid in comparison with BiOCl using nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis as shown in Fig. 8b and c. From this analysis a type IV isotherm was observed, which indicates the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm) formed between BiOCl nanosheets. However, in this nanohybrid system the incorporation of CDs leads to the reduction of the BET surface area. The BiOCl nanosheets exhibited a BET surface area of 31.96 m2 g−1, whereas the BET surface areas of the CD/BiOCl nanohybrids were found to be 23.87, 17.68 and 9.94 m2 g−1 for 3, 5 and 8 wt% of CDs in the nanohybrids, respectively.

The most fascinating features of CDs are excitation wavelength dependent PL behavior, overall biocompatibility as well as water solubility (nanoscale stable dispersibility). PL is the classic signature of CDs. In spite of the diversity in structure, all types of CDs prepared by different approaches from various carbon precursors, exhibit a similar type of PL behavior. Generally, PL spectra of different types of CDs show the highest intense emissive peak in the visible region (400–500 nm) at an excitation wavelength of 340–380 nm. The most interesting feature in the PL of CDs is the emission wavelength-dependent excitation behavior. Thus the PL emission peak position and its intensity are always related to the excitation wavelength. A large number of studies demonstrated that this type of PL behavior of CDs is mainly controlled by the size of the graphitic core and the functional groups present on the surface, though the exact mechanism is still not very conclusive and hence needs more understanding and clarification. The quantum size graphitic core controls the PL behavior by the quantum confinement effect through the variation of band gap with the size of the quantum carbon dots. On the other hand, surface functional groups have different energy levels, which may result in a series of emissive traps. It is assumed that upon excitation of a certain wavelength of light, a surface state emissive trap dominates the emission, while upon excitation of some other wavelengths, other corresponding surface state emissive traps become dominant.

However, CDs exhibit a broader PL profile and lower quantum yield compared to semiconductor quantum dots. But still they display more fascinating PL behavior in the application point of view due to their photo-induced electron and charge transfer ability, and up-conversion luminescence properties. As the photo-excited CDs can act both as an excellent electron donor and an electron acceptor, the PL intensity of CDs could be quenched efficiently either by electron acceptor or electron donor molecules. Yu et al. investigated the transfer efficiency of photo-generated electrons in the CD/TiO2 nanosheets (CD/TNS) nanohybrid by transient photocurrent response measurements, as shown in Fig. 9a. The figure shows the photocurrent responses of three types of materials, namely pure TiO2 nanosheets (TNS) and the nanohybrids CD/P25 and CD/TiO2 nanosheets (CD/TNS) and the results are compared. It is observed that the CD/TNS nanohybrid exhibited stronger transient photocurrent response, which is about 3 times larger than that of the CD/P25 nanohybrid, while pure TiO2 did not show any transient photocurrent response. These results clearly indicate that the CD/TiO2 nanosheets nanohybrid exhibited the highest transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons. Di et al. also carried out the transient photocurrent response analysis for the CD/Bi2MoO6 nanohybrid to study its photo-induced electron transfer process. It is noticed that the photocurrent of the CD/Bi2MoO6 nanohybrid is almost three times higher than that of pure Bi2MoO6. This significant improvement of photocurrent response of the nanohybrid revealed that the photogenerated electrons in the conductance band (CB) of Bi2MoO6 are transferred to the CDs.
On the other hand, up-conversion PL is another most interesting optical property of CDs, which makes them a promising material for photocatalytic application, particularly after combining with different types of metal based nanomaterials. Up-conversion luminescence is a process in which the sequential absorption of two or more photons leads to the emission of light at a shorter wavelength than the excitation wavelength. Thus the emission of higher-energy photons occurs upon excitation with lower-energy photons. Cao et al. first introduced the two-photon emission of CDs under irradiation of an argon-ion laser in the visible region (458 nm) or a femtosecond pulsed laser in the near-infrared range (800 nm). Later, several researchers also observed up-conversion fluorescence emissions of CDs prepared by different synthesis approaches.Fig. 9b shows the typical PL spectra of CDs excited by long wavelengths of light at 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 and 1000 nm, where the emissions are located at shorter wavelengths of 300–650 nm, as reported by Zhang et al. The detailed emission energy distribution located in the range of 300–530 nm after up-conversion is also compared, as shown in Fig. 9c. It is found that upon excitation in the wavelength range of 700–1000 nm, a large distribution of shorter emission wavelengths in the area 300–530 nm results, which is much more useful. This up-conversion PL of CDs is very important for different photochemical applications based on metal semiconductor nanohybrids. The up-conversion PL of CDs is employed to transfer lower energy photons into higher energy ones, which can excite the conduction band electrons of the semiconductor materials according to their band gaps. Thus the CD metal based nanohybrids showed excellent photochemical properties compared to the pure semiconductor metal nanoparticles or even pristine CDs.

Recently, based on the photo-induced electron and charge transfer ability, and up-conversion PL properties of CDs, CD–metal based nanohybrids are gaining great attention in different photochemical and electrochemical applications including photocatalysis, solar-cell or photoelectric devices, energy storage, sensing, etc. These different types of applications of CD–metal based nanohybrids are described in this section.

Photocatalysis is one of the greenest techniques to prepare various substances as well as to degrade different types of anthropogenic organic chemicals. This is also useful for environmental remedy as well as production of H2 and O2 using solar energy. Generally, metal based semiconductor materials are widely used for the same purpose. However, efficiency, cost-performance ratio, toxicity, etc. are the major concerns for such catalysts. Again, the wide band gap (in the UV region) of the semiconductor metals also inhibits the total utilization of the solar energy (UV is only 3–4% of sunlight), because visible and infrared parts account for the majority in photocatalysis. Therefore, recently researchers have designed CD–metal based nanohybrids to increase the photocatalytic efficiency using the full spectrum of solar light. This enhanced photocatalytic effect is mainly due to the photo-induced electron transfer and up-conversion PL properties of CDs.

Li et al. designed a TiO2/CD and SiO2/CD nanohybrids based photocatalyst to harness the use of the full spectrum of sunlight, based on the up-conversion luminescence properties of CDs. These nanohybrids are used for the degradation reaction of methylene blue (MB) under visible light. It is observed that use of pure TiO2 or SiO2 without CDs as photocatalysts resulted in no or only a very limited amount (<5% for TiO2, <10% for SiO2) of degradation of MB. Thus it is proved that CDs are necessary for the efficient photo-degradation of MB under visible light. In contrast, under the same conditions, it is found that degradation of MB is nearly 0% when pure CDs are used as the catalyst. The results indicate that the excellent photocatalytic activities of TiO2/CD and SiO2/CD nanohybrids might be attributed to the interactions between CDs and TiO2 or SiO2 in the catalyst system. The mechanism of this photocatalytic reaction can be put forward as follows. When the nanohybrid based photocatalysts are illuminated by solar light, CDs absorb visible light and emit shorter wavelength of light (325–425 nm) by up-conversion PL, which in turn excites the electrons of TiO2 or SiO2 to generate electron/hole (e−/h+) pairs. These e−/h+ pairs react with the adsorbed oxidant/reductant (usually O2/OH−) to produce active oxygen radicals (e.g. ˙O2−, ˙OH), which subsequently cause degradation of the MB dye. Again, in the nanohybrids as CDs are situated on the surface of TiO2 or SiO2, the relative position of the CD band edge permits the transfer of electrons from the TiO2/SiO2 surface, which allows charge separation, stabilization, as well as hindered recombination. The electrons can shuttle freely with the conducting network of CDs, thus the longer-lived holes on the TiO2 or SiO2 account for the higher activity of the nanohybrid based photocatalysts.
Thus, based on this up-conversion PL of CDs different researchers reported different kinds of CD–metal based nanohybrids as photocatalysts. Li et al. further developed a CD/cuprous oxide (CD/Cu2O) nanohybrid catalyst based on the collective effect of the superior light reflecting ability of the Cu2O protruding nanostructures and the up-conversion PL property of CDs to harness the near infrared light. The diffuse reflectance spectroscopic (DRS) results demonstrated that the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid can absorb significantly more light in the 600–2500 nm region compared to the pure commercial Cu2O, as shown in Fig. 10a. Fig. 10b shows that the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid possesses lower reflectance (18.85–30.36%) than the commercial Cu2O (48.81–68.75%) in the range of 640–2500 nm, which further demonstrates that the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid possesses a better light restriction ability. These results define that the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid is NIR-sensitive, where the combination of two parts gives rise to synergistic properties arising from the beneficial interaction between CDs and Cu2O. A series of photoelectrochemical experiments are performed to evaluate the photoelectrochemical properties of CD/Cu2O. The CD/Cu2O nanohybrid indeed generates significant photocurrent even under NIR-light irradiation (red line in Fig. 10c), while pure CDs (blue line) and Cu2O (black line) display weak and no photocurrent, respectively. For the photocatalytic activity of the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid, the degradation of MB solution is performed under NIR light. The corresponding plot of MB concentration versus reaction time with different photocatalysts under irradiation of NIR light (λ > 700 nm) is shown in Fig. 10d, which shows that the photodegradation process by the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid is efficient and about 90% MB degradation is observed after 240 min of exposure. In contrast, with pure CDs or Cu2O as the photocatalyst, no or little (<3%) degradation of MB is only observed. The photocatalytic behaviors of the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid under different light irradiations (UV, visible and NIR lights) are also examined. Fig. 10e shows the photocatalytic ability of the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid under NIR light irradiation (150 W). The efficiency is found to be lower than the other two control experiments that are performed under 150 W UV and visible lights, but remarkably higher than the experiment using 18 W UV light as the irradiation light source. Thus the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid realizes the efficient usage of the full spectrum of sunlight. Fig. 10f shows digital images of MB solutions after different times of NIR light irradiation. On the basis of these results, the photocatalytic process of the CD/Cu2O nanohybrid under NIR light is shown in Fig. 10g. When the CDs/Cu2O nanohybrid photocatalyst is illuminated (1), the protruding nanostructures allow multiple reflections of NIR light between the vacant spaces of these protruding particles, which can make better use of the source light and therefore offering improved photocatalytic activity. On the other hand, CDs can absorb NIR light (>700 nm) and then emit a shorter wavelength of light (390–564 nm) by up-conversion PL, which in turn further excites Cu2O to form (e−/h+) pairs (2), and thus enhanced photocatalytic activity as described earlier.
In our previous study we have also utilized a polymer supported CDs reduced Cu2O nanohybrid as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the degradation of an organophosphate pesticide (ethyl paraoxon) under solar light. In this photocatalytic reaction though the mechanism of degradation is the same as described above by up-conversion luminescence, the functional groups of the polymer matrix also played a supporting role in interacting with the polar pesticide molecules. Further, recovery of the used catalyst from the reaction medium was very easy and thus it could be recycled. In that study we used 1 wt% CDs and 1 wt% nanohybrid in hyperbranched epoxy thermosets (coded as ECD1.0 and ECDCO1.0, respectively) as the photocatalysts for the degradation reaction under normal solar light. The plots of optical absorbance against wavelength for the degradation of the pesticide at different times for ECDCO1.0 are shown in Fig. 11a. The degradation of the pesticide with time for ECDCO1.0 (both in the dark and solar light), ECD1.0 and the pure nanohybrid is shown in Fig. 11b. From these results, it is clear that the time taken for 90% degradation of the pesticide is 5 h for ECDCO1.0, whereas only 50% degradation of the same is observed after 12 h for ECD1.0 under the same solar light. Furthermore, no degradation is observed under dark conditions. The examination of the photocatalytic activity of the pure nanohybrid (same amount as that of ECDCO1.0) revealed that the initial degradation rate was slightly slower than that of ECDCO1.0. This is due to the presence of different polar functional groups in hyperbranched epoxy that interacted with the polar organophosphate pesticide thereby adhering on the surface, which facilitates interaction with the active oxygen radicals, generated through a photochemical reaction as stated earlier. However, due to the presence of the active agent (1 wt% nanohybrid) in both the cases the same extent of degradation is observed over the same total period of exposure. The photo-degradation mechanism is schematically illustrated in Fig. 11c, based on the up-conversion PL property of CDs.
We have also comparatively studied the photocatalytic degradation of paraoxon pesticide, benzene and phenol by CDs, bare TiO2, in situ prepared CD–TiO2 (CD@TiO2) and ex situ prepared CD–TiO2 (CD/TiO2) nanohybrids under normal solar light.Fig. 11d–f show the rates of degradation of the pesticide, phenol and benzene by CD@TiO2 and CD/TiO2. Around 90% degradation of the pesticide is completed at 7.5 h with CD@TiO2, whereas only 70% degradation of the same is observed with CD/TiO2 even after 9 h. Similarly, around 90% degradation of benzene is found after 7 h of light exposure with CD@TiO2, whereas only 60% degradation by CDs/TiO2 of the same is observed after 9.5 h. On the other hand, the time taken for 93% degradation of phenol is 6.5 h with CD@TiO2, while CD/TiO2 degraded the same up to 65% after 9 h. We also observed that bare TiO2 and CDs exhibited only marginal photocatalytic activity for the degradation of these chemicals even after 9 h. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency in the nanohybrid system is due to the up-conversion luminescence of CDs and the reduction of e−/h+ recombination rate in the nanohybrid system. Again, CD@TiO2 showed a higher effect compared to CD/TiO2 due to the difference in structural morphology. TiO2 present in the CD@TiO2 nanohybrid is the anatase form, as CDs act as a better dispersing agent through in situ fabrication compared to the ex situ one. Thus, in the CD/TiO2 nanohybrid, TiO2 existed in the rutile form along with anatase. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 strongly depends on its crystallite size, phase structure, pore structure and specific surface area. The anatase form possesses a smaller size, superior surface adsorption capacity and higher specific surface area compared to the rutile form. Because of the smaller size anatase exhibits a larger band gap (3.2 eV) compared to rutile (3.0 eV) and thus it can absorb more solar light which apparently enhances the photocatalytic activity. Besides this, the lifetime of photogenerated e− and h+ in anatase is about an order of magnitude higher compared to the rutile phase. Thus the chance of participation of photoexcited e− and h+ of anatase in surface chemical reactions is greatly enhanced.
Tian et al. reported a CD/hydrogenated TiO2 nanobelt (CD/H-TiO2) heterostructure based broad spectrum photocatalyst under UV, visible, and near-infrared irradiation to remove organic contaminants and produce hydrogen fuel. The photocatalytic degradation of an organic dye (methyl orange, MO) in aqueous medium by the heterostructure and pure nanostructures CD/H-TiO2 under UV, visible and NIR light irradiation is shown in Fig. 12a–c, where C and C0 are the concentrations of MO at a wavelength of 465 nm after and before irradiation. Fig. 12a shows the photo-degradation of MO under UV irradiation, in which the efficiency of the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure is found to be more than 86% within 25 min. The photocatalytic activity of CD/H-TiO2 is also found to be superior compared to pure P25 (66%), TiO2 nanobelt (63%) and H-TiO2 nanobelt (82%). The UV photocatalytic activity of the H-TiO2 nanobelt is better than that of P25 and TiO2 nanobelt due to the oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, created by hydrogenation. Ti3+ species can serve as h+ scavengers. Also, oxygen vacancies on the surface of the TiO2 nanobelt would act as O2 binding sites and e− scavengers, thus suppressing the e−/h+ recombination and remarkably improve the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanobelt. Superior photocatalytic activity (50%) is also found for the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure under visible light irradiation for 25 min (Fig. 12b), compared to H-TiO2 nanobelts (45%), P25 (26%) and pure TiO2 nanobelt (17%). Here the enhanced photocatalytic activity is due to the fast electron transfer between CDs and the H-TiO2 nanobelt, which can effectively promote the efficient separation of e−/h+ pairs. In addition, the visible photocatalytic activity of the H-TiO2 nanobelt is better than that of P25 and TiO2 nanobelt because of the narrower band gap of the H-TiO2 nanobelt, which exhibited enhanced visible light absorption in the region of 400–800 nm. However, under NIR light irradiation (Fig. 12c) the photo-degradation is found to be significant (32% MO decomposed after 120 min) over the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure. But in the control experiments using P25, TiO2 nanobelt, and H-TiO2 nanobelt as photocatalysts, no or little degradation of MO is only observed. This is because of the fact that TiO2 nanobelt and H-TiO2 nanobelt photocatalysts do not respond to light beyond 740 nm, but after the formation of the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure, it can respond to NIR light. These results demonstrated that CDs play a key role in enhancing NIR photocatalytic activity. The H-TiO2 nanobelt can only excite and form photogenerated (e−/h+) pairs under light energy of wavelengths shorter than 530 nm, as its band gap is about 2.4 eV. So here the up-conversion PL behavior of CDs makes the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure useful in the NIR light region. The NIR light is harvested by CDs and converted to visible light, which subsequently excite H-TiO2 to complete the NIR-photocatalysis process of the nanohybrid. The enhanced photocatalytic property of the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure by photocatalytic hydrogen evolution through water-splitting is further demonstrated as shown in Fig. 12d. The TiO2 nanobelt shows poor photocatalytic oxygen production activity (0.65 mmol h−1 g−1) as it can only absorb UV light. However, the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate of about 7.42 mmol h−1 g−1, which is higher than that of the H-TiO2 nanobelt (6.01 mmol h−1 g−1). The significant photocatalytic oxygen production activities are due to the efficient visible light absorption by the H-TiO2 nanobelt. Again, the synergistic effect of CDs and the heterostructure formation enable higher photocatalytic hydrogen production of the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure than the pure H-TiO2 nanobelt. Therefore, in the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure, the H-TiO2 nanobelt is expected to act as an efficient light harvester and the heterostructure provides efficient charge separation to suppress the (e−/h+) recombination, which greatly enhances the photocatalytic activity in the production of hydrogen. On the basis of these results, the photocatalytic process of the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure under UV, visible and NIR light irradiation is described schematically in Fig. 12e. The heterostructure enhanced the photocatalytic activities by promoting the separation of photo-generated e−/h+ pairs. The large specific surface area of the CD/H-TiO2 heterostructure also helps to adsorb more pollutant molecules compared to other nanomaterials. Thus photo-induced e−/h+ pairs can easily degrade these adsorbed pollutant molecules. Further, CDs absorb NIR light (>700 nm) and emit shorter wavelength of light (390–564 nm) by up-conversion PL, which subsequently excites the H-TiO2 nanobelt to form e−/h+ pairs.
Yu et al. utilized a CDs modified TiO2 nanohybrid (CD/P25) photocatalyst for the evolution of H2 from aqueous methanol under exposure to UV and visible light (λ > 450 nm) at room temperature. In this study, pure P25 shows a relatively low photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (2.3 μmol h−1) under UV-Vis light irradiation may be due to the rapid recombination of photo-induced e− and h+. However, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate increases steadily with the increase of CD content in the nanohybrid as shown in Fig. 13a. The highest evolution rate (9.1 μmol h−1) is found for the nanohybrid with 1.5 wt% CDs, which is ∼4 times higher than that of pure P25. Unfortunately, on further increasing the content of the CDs a gradual decrease of H2 evolution rate is observed, which is most probably due to the decrease in the absorption of incident light resulting from the opacity and light scattering of CDs, and the reduction in catalytic active sites. On the other hand, under the visible light, pure P25 shows nearly no photocatalytic activity as it cannot be excited by visible light (λ > 450 nm) due to its large band gap (>3.0 eV, can only be excited by light of λ < 413 nm), whereas after the formation of the nanohybrid the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate increases gradually with the CDs loading under visible light irradiation, and the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (0.5 μmol h−1) is reached at 2 wt% CDs loading here, as shown in Fig. 13b. It is also found that CD/P25 can generate H2 in the pure water medium (without methanol) under UV light irradiation, but the evolution rate is about an order of magnitude lower than that in aqueous methanol medium. However, no H2 evolution takes place in pure water under visible light irradiation. These results revealed that methanol can scavenge the h+ in P25 effectively to improve the H2 evolution rate under UV irradiation, and the h+ photo-induced from CDs under visible light irradiation can oxidize methanol but not OH− in pure water. Electrochemical experiments are also conducted to show the photoinduced charge-transfer behaviour as shown in Fig. 13c and d. Both P25 and CD/P25 show sensitive photocurrent responses during repeated on/off cycles under UV-Vis irradiation (Fig. 13c). Further, the variation of the stable photocurrent density of CD/P25 is consistent with their photocatalytic H2 evolution activities. The enhanced photocurrent response of CD/P25 can be attributed to the coupling with CDs which served as the electron reservoir like the frequently used co-catalyst Pt in photocatalytic H2 production to trap the photo-induced electrons from P25 and thus enhance the separation efficiency of e− and h+. Significant improvement of photocurrent responses is also observed under visible light (λ > 450 nm) irradiation for CD/P25 compared with P25, as shown in Fig. 13d, which is also consistent with their photocatalytic H2 evolution activities. This suggests that CDs played an important role in the improvement of visible-light-driven photocatalytic activities of CD/P25. Here the π conjugated CDs act as a photosensitizer, like organic dyes, and thus the photo-excited electrons transfer from the CDs to P25. Based on these results, a possible mechanism is proposed for the photocatalytic H2 evolution by CDs/P25 as shown in Fig. 13e. The presence of CDs in CD/P25 plays important dual roles in the improvement of photocatalytic activity for H2 production. Firstly, under UV light irradiation, CDs serve as electron reservoirs to trap photo-induced electrons from the conduction band of P25, which facilitates the efficient separation of e− and h+, and therefore enhance the photocatalytic activity. Secondly, under visible light irradiation, the π-conjugated CDs act as a photosensitizer similar to organic dyes for sensitizing P25 into a visible light responsive ‘diode’ structure, where CDs donate the electrons to the conduction band of P25, thereby resulting in the visible-light driven photocatalytic H2 production activity. Wang et al. reported an inexpensive bidentate-complex-derived TiO2/CD photocatalyst for the evolution of H2 from water by a similar mechanism. The study showed that the nanohybrid photocatalyst exhibited up to 9.7 times higher H2 evolution rate than that of bare TiO2. Here CDs serve as both an electron acceptor and a donor, and the photo-induced electrons can transfer from CDs to the TiO2 surface, while the redundant electrons on TiO2 can transfer back to CDs.
Based on the same mechanism, researchers developed many more CD supported metal nanohybrid based photocatalysts with Fe2O3, ZnO, CdS, ZnS, Ag3PO4, BiVO4, Bi2MoO6, etc. Chai et al. reported CD/CdS heterojunction film with intimate interfacial contact that is beneficial for charge separation and transfer, and ultimately leads to a high photocurrent density. In addition, the electron donor–acceptor heterojunction also expedited charge separation and effectively suppressed e−/h+ pair recombination, which contributed to enhancing the photo-electrochemical and photocatalytic efficiency of the system. Based on the enhanced photocatalytic effect of CD/CdS, a mechanism is proposed as shown in Fig. 13f. Under visible light irradiation, both CDs and CdS are excited to separate e− and h+ that are generated within them. The lower-lying CB edge of CDs enables transfer of the electrons from CdS to CDs, and concomitant movement of holes in the valence band (VB) of CDs to CdS. Consequently, an efficient charge separated state is formed and the electrons are thereafter utilized in the reduction reactions. Meanwhile, the sacrificial reagent replenishes electrons to make the photocatalytic cycle sustainable.
CD supported metal nanohybrid based photocatalysts are not only utilized in photo-degradation or H2 evolution reactions, but researchers also used these nanohybrid catalysts in photochemical organic synthesis reactions. Liu et al. reported a gold/CD (Au/CD) nanohybrid photocatalyst for efficient catalytic oxidation of alkanes (cyclohexane) with high selectivity under visible light at room temperature. The nanohybrid based photocatalyst yields 63.8% conversion efficiency and 99.9% selectivity for the green oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone, using H2O2 under visible light at room temperature (Fig. 14a). Different types of light source are utilized as shown in Fig. 14b. The figure shows that the best conversion efficiency is obtained in green light, whose wavelength matches the surface plasma resonance zone of Au nanoparticles (490–590 nm). However, it is also found that under the same conditions (visible light, room temperature), the use of Au nanoparticles supported on SiO2 spheres or other carbon based materials as catalysts yielded very low conversion efficiency with low selectivity for the production of cyclohexanone. The high conversion and selectivity of this photocatalyst system is attributed to the collective contribution and interactions of CDs and Au nanoparticles. Here CDs act as both electron acceptors and electron donors that led to quenching of PL excitation under visible light (at 485 nm) with emission at 550 nm. The study showed that PL intensity is effectively quenched in the Au/CD system (Fig. 14c). Further, the electrocatalytic ability of the Au/CD nanohybrid is studied for H2O2 decomposition in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell and the results are shown in Fig. 14d. The bare glassy carbon electrode shows no obvious electrochemical response (black curve), while the Au/CD-modified glassy carbon electrode exhibits significant catalytic ability for H2O2 decomposition. The response of Au/CD-modified electrode for H2O2 decomposition is found to be stronger (onset potential at −0.2 V) under visible-light irradiation compared to that without light irradiation (onset potential at −0.6 V). Further it is noticed that Au/CD nanohybrid modified electrodes exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity for H2O2 decomposition among various modified electrodes (CDs, Au nanoparticles and their mixture). These electrochemical results for H2O2 decomposition suggested that the visible light-promoted catalytic activity of the Au/CD nanohybrid played a key role in the high catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane. Here, after decomposition of H2O2, the active radical HO˙ is produced, which is a strong oxidant, and can easily oxidize cyclohexane to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol.

CDs possess excellent photo-absorption capacity as well as electron accepting and transport properties, which provide new opportunities to use them for photo-energy conversion related applications like solar cells and photovoltaic devices. Recently, they have been used as a photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), counter electrode in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), hole transport material in perovskite solar cells; and for electron/energy transportation in polymer solar cells (PSCs) and photovoltaic devices. Zhang et al. utilized nitrogen doped CDs (NCDs) as a photosensitizer for TiO2-based DSSCs in which NCDs exhibited superior sensitization compared to pure CDs due to the more efficient transfer of photo-induced electrons to the CB of TiO2.Fig. 14e shows the current density–voltage characteristics of NCD and CD sensitized TiO2-based DSSCs under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation, in which the CD-sensitized solar cell exhibited a short circuit current (Jsc) of 0.33 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.37 V, a fill factor of 28% and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.03%, while the NCD sensitized solar cell exhibited a Jsc of 0.69 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.46 V, fill factor of 43% and overall PCE of 0.13%. It is also found that the same TiO2 solar cell in the absence of any photosensitizer shows a Jsc of 0.2 mA cm−2, which is apparently lower than those of CD and NCD sensitized solar cells.

Briscoe et al. reported hybrid materials consisting of ZnO nanorods sensitized with three different biomass samples (chitin, CT; chitosan, CS and glucose, G) derived CDs to build solid-state nanostructured solar cells. The current–voltage curves of the solar-cell are shown in Fig. 14f. The highest efficiency is found for the combination of relatively high Voc and Jsc associated with relatively low series resistance (Rs) and high shunt resistance (Rsh) for the CS-CD-sensitized device. This precursor dependent solar-cell performance indicates that the functionalization actually determines the binding of CDs to the ZnO surface and the nature of the charge transport in the layer, which ultimately influence the solar cell performance. It also alters the composition of the coating layer assembled by the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique (alternating layers of either CS- and CT-CD or CS- and G-CD to utilize the opposite charges of the amine and hydroxyl groups in solution) to increase the light absorption. Fig. 14g depicts a clear increase in optical absorption compared to the single-CD and the combination of CS- and CT-CDs produced an increased efficiency of 0.077%. These alternating layers of CDs led to high light absorption by increasing the loading on the ZnO surface. However, the effects of the functional groups of the two types of CDs on the transport properties of the film are complementary, which enable a high Jsc without increasing Rs or reducing the fill factor (FF) and Voc.
Recently, Choi and his research group exploited CD–gold nanoraspberries (CD–Au NRs) as a counter electrode material for ZnO nanowire/CdS/CdSe quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). The nanohybrid based counter electrode exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity, lower charger-transfer resistance, and larger exchange current density compared to the Au-sputtered counter electrode. The PCE of the cell improved up to 5.4% compared to the cells employing Au-sputtered and CD counter electrodes, where efficiencies are found to be 3.6% and 0.18%, respectively. The schematic diagram of the cell assembly is shown in Fig. 15a, where the working electrode and the counter electrode are assembled into a sandwich type ZnO NW/CdS/CdSe cell. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics obtained with various counter electrodes are shown in Fig. 15b, which clearly indicate that the solar cell performance is considerably influenced by the choice of the counter electrode materials. The CD–Au NR based counter electrode exhibited a Voc of 708 mV, Jsc of 16.6 mA cm−2, and FF of 46%, resulting in an average PCE of 5.4%. In contrast, the QDSC using the Au-based counter electrode exhibited a Jsc of 13.2 mAcm−2, FF of 39%, and PCE of 3.6%, while CDs alone are not a suitable material for the counter electrode, as they show a much lower PCE (0.18%). The high performance of QDSCs using the nanohybrid counter electrode is due to its much larger surface area than the Au electrode, which leads to an increase in the number of electrocatalytic active sites. In addition, the presence of many active sites on the CD surface also provides electrochemical active sites and improves charge transfer rate. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows the effect of the counter electrode materials on QDSC performance, which is closely related to their electrical conductivities and electrocatalytic activities towards regenerating the S2/Sx2− redox couple. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CD–Au NR counter electrode is found to be smaller (2.02 Ω cm2) compared to the CD (12404.81 Ω cm2) and Au-sputtered (14.12 Ω cm2) counter electrodes, as shown in Nyquist plots of the symmetric cells (Fig. 15c). This indicates the superior charge transfer and electrocatalytic ability of the CD–Au NRs at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The Tafel curves (Fig. 15d) also show higher limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) for the CD–Au NR counter electrode than the other counter electrodes from the diffusion zone. This also indicates that the CD–Au NR counter electrode shows the largest diffusion coefficient (D) compared to others. The Tafel-polarization analysis indicates that the CD–Au NR counter electrode exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of Sn2− to nS2− in comparison to CD or Au based counter electrodes.
Wang et al. reported nitrogen doped CDs (NCDs) as an interface material that was integrated with porous TiO2 for QDSCs due to their enhanced visible-light absorption. The enhanced absorption of light in the visible region (400 to 550 nm) by the NCD/TiO2 photoanode compared to the pure TiO2 photoanode is shown in Fig. 16a, which implies that the former can be used as a photosensitizer. In this case TiO2 impedes the recombination of photogenerated e− and h+ in excited NCDs and absorbs the photogenerated electrons. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve (Fig. 16b) of NCD sensitized solar cells under AM 1.5 G one full sun illumination shows a Jsc of 2.65 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.47 V, FF of 62.5%, and overall PCE of 0.79%. From the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted in Fig. 16c it is found that the overall photocurrent response closely matches the corresponding absorption spectrum of NCD-sensitized TiO2 film as shown in Fig. 16a. The IPCE value is found to be >10% between 400 and 550 nm. Again, Fig. 16d represents the schematic diagram of the photo-induced electron transition between NCD and TiO2. N-doping of CDs (NCDs) can introduce an additional energy level between the π of carbon and π* of oxygen compared to N-free CDs. Thus, NCDs can absorb the relatively low-energy photons after excitation in the visible light range and generate the photo-excited electrons, which resulted in the transfer of more electrons to the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in higher current density.
Very recently, Paulo et al. utilized CDs as a new h+ transport material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3%.Fig. 16e depicts the device structure (upper inset) and energy levels of the materials employed with the device architecture. The HOMO energy value lies above the MAPI (methyl ammonium lead iodide) perovskite valence band (VB) energy (−5.5 eV), which ensures efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to CDs. The inset (lower part) of Fig. 16e shows the J–V characteristics, which provide the evidence that the CD layer is beneficial compared to the absence of an HTM in the device. The reference cell with spiro-OMeTAD (which is right now the most used HTM in this type of cells) performs much better, in terms of Jsc, Voc and, thus PCE. The increase in VOC and FF upon insertion of a CD layer suggests that the latter fairly improves the contact between the perovskite and the Au electrode.
Pan et al. reported CD/p-type CuAlO2/n-type ZnO photoelectric bilayer nanohybrid film for photoelectric devices by exploiting the unique up-conversion photoluminescence behavior of CDs. The photoelectric properties of the nanohybrid films are shown in Fig. 17a, where samples exhibit high photosensitivity after incorporation of CDs on the surface of the devices. The photosensitivity increases gradually with increase in the amount of CDs from 0 to 2 mg mL−1 and then decreases at 3 mg mL−1. Fig. 17b shows the up-conversion PL spectra of CDs at the excitation wavelength range from 550 to 850 nm. The curves indicate that the up-converted emission is located near 360 nm and exhibits an excitation-dependent behavior. Fig. 17c describes the schematic diagram of the photovoltaic process in which after incorporation of CDs into the nanohybrid system, a part of the visible light is emitted as shorter wavelength, which may cause the photo-generated e−/h+ pairs to enhance the photoconductivity. In this device, the resistance of the p-type semiconductor, CuAlO2 is considered to be the main factor which is much greater than that of ZnO. The light (λ ≤ 360) could excite CuAlO2 to increase photo-generated holes, and the extra electrons drift to ZnO to promote the separation of photo-generated e−/h+ pairs, which is one of the most important reasons for the conductivity. CDs accept the photo-generated electrons from the semiconductor to promote the separation.
CD metal based nanohybrid systems are also gaining interest in polymer solar cell (PSC) devices. Choi et al. prepared CD-supported silver nanoparticles (CD–Ag nanoparticles) for the fabrication of solution-processable PSCs using the surface plasmon resonance effect. This effect of the nanohybrid allows significant radiative emission and additional light absorption that lead to remarkably enhanced PCE and internal quantum efficiency in PSCs. The CD–Ag nanoparticles are used as plasmonic materials in PSCs. The used PSC device structure is a glass/ITO/CD–Ag nanoparticles/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/Al as shown in Fig. 18a. In this case the active layer, PTB7 is poly[[4,8-bis-[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] and the PC71BM layer is [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and EQE of the devices with and without CD–Ag nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 18b and c. The device without CD–Ag nanoparticles showed Jsc: 14.4 mA cm−2, Voc: 0.75 V, FF: 0.70 and PCE: 7.53%, whereas the device with CD–Ag nanoparticles showed a Jsc of 16.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.75 V, FF of 0.70 and PCE of 8.31%. An improvement in the PCE can be primarily attributed to the increase in Jsc caused by EQE enhancement in the range 400–700 nm, as shown in Fig. 18c, whereas Voc and FF remained the same. The enhanced absorption (Δa) and EQE (ΔEQE) of the CD–Ag nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 18d to clarify the effect of CD–Ag nanoparticles on the photogeneration of charge carriers. These results demonstrate that the nanohybrid system constitutes a versatile and effective route for achieving high-performance polymer optoelectronic devices.

Energy storage is one of the most promising and attractive electrochemical applications of carbon based nanomaterials. Among these applications, supercapacitors are one of the most promising devices to store energy for the next-generation wearable electronics due to the transport of high power within a very short period. Generally, carbon based materials store energy by the electrical double layer capacitance (EDLC) mechanism, and thus they have low energy density. On the other hand, pseudo-capacitive materials such as transition metal oxides or sulfides exhibit high energy density by their faradaic reactions. However, they are associated with problems such as poor electrical conductivity and cycling instability in electrolyte solutions. Therefore, recently nanohybrid materials have gained more interest in electrochemical energy storage applications. In this context, CD–metal based nanohybrids and 3-D materials are widely used in supercapacitor and Li/Na-ion battery applications due to their zero-dimensional graphitic structures with good conductivity, rapid electron transfer, electron reservoir properties, easy large scale production and low cost. CDs also possess numerous functional groups on their surface, which enhance the capacitance values by facilitating the redox reaction during electrochemical performance. Zhu et al. first reported a CDs decorated RuO2 nanohybrid network based supercapacitor with ultrafast charge and discharge capability. The reported supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 460 F g−1 at a high current density of 50 A g−1, and excellent rate capability (88.6, 84.2, and 77.4% capacity retention rates at 10, 20, and 50 A g−1, respectively at a current density of 1 A g−1) and exceptional cycling stability (96.9% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1). The supercapacitor performances of the nanohybrid material and only RuO2 are shown in Fig. 19. The specific capacitance value of the hybrid is greatly improved compared to that of pure RuO2. The nanohybrid also exhibits much better rate capability and the capacity retention rate at a current density of 50 A g−1 significantly improved from 58.3% to 77.4%, which demonstrates the ultrahigh rate performance of the hybrid. The effective prevention of the agglomeration of RuO2 particles in the nanohybrid system greatly enhanced the electrochemical performance by decreasing the interparticle resistance of electron pathways and reducing the diffusion path, which facilitates the fast charge transport and ionic motion during the charge–discharge process and leads to rapid redox reactions. This is further supported by the Nyquist plot (Fig. 19c), in which the contact resistance of the hybrid is found to be smaller than that of pure RuO2, and thus the power performance especially high current charge and discharge performance of the hybrid is better than that of pure RuO2.

The same research group further developed an asymmetric supercapacitor based on a bimetallic system (NiCo2O4) tuned through CDs. This CD based nanohybrid material (CD/NiCo2O4) possesses a unique porous structure with a large specific surface area, high mesoporosity and superior electronic conductivity, and thus it exhibited high specific capacitance (856 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent rate capability (83.9%, 72.5% and 60.8% capacity retention rates at 20, 50 and 100 A g−1, respectively) and exceptional cycling stability (98.75% of the initial capacity retention over 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Further, the fabricated AC//CD/NiCo2O4 asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a high energy density (27.8 W h kg−1) at a power density of 128 W kg−1 or a high power density (10.24 kW kg−1) at a reasonable energy density of 13.1 W h kg−1 and remarkable cycling stability (101.9% of the initial capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 3 A g−1). The detailed performance of the asymmetric supercapacitor is shown in Fig. 20. This high performance supercapacitive behavior is due to the low resistance of the electrode and the ultrafast electronic and ionic transport rates between the CD/NiCo2O4 nanohybrid electrode and the conductive Ni foam substrate. Here, the strong chemical interactions between NiCo2O4 and residual oxygen-containing functional groups on CDs, or van der Waals interactions between NiCo2O4 and CDs also enhance the performance.
Recently, Xu et al. also reported a CD/nickel oxide (CD/NiO) nanorods based supercapacitor, where high specific capacitance (1858 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), exceptional rate capability (84.6%, 75.7%, 65.3%, 56.1% and 51.5% capacity retention rates at 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 A g−1, respectively) and excellent cycling stability (93% of the initial capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1) are observed, due to the coupled effect of faradaic pseudo-capacitance from the NiO nanorods and the excellent electrical conductivity of the CD nanohybrid. The nanohybrid electrode exhibited the synergistic effect of CDs and NiO through their unique 1D nanostructure and large specific surface area. The nanohybrid showed low ion diffusion resistance and fast faradaic reactions. Here, CDs reduced the charge transfer resistance of NiO and improved the electronic conduction during the charge–discharge cyclic process. Again, Wei et al. presented a CD/Ni–Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanohybrid, which exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1794 F g−1 (at 2 A g−1), high rate capability of 967 F g−1 (at 20 A g−1) and excellent cycle performance (about 93% retention over 1500 cycles) due to the unique structure and high conductive behavior, which are convenient for the rapid and reversible charge transfer during electrochemical reactions. The excellent specific capacitance is attributed to the collaborative effects of the CD/NiAl-LDH nanostructures, which possess a lamellar structure with enlarged interlayer spacing. This characteristic nanostructure not only ensures fast ion diffusion but also provides continuous electron pathways in the electrochemical reactions. Again, the pristine NiAl-LDH nanosheets become thinner during the self-assembly process by incorporating CDs, which facilitates the access of the electrolyte and easy exposure of active sites. The presence of nano-sized CDs also improves the electrical conductivity and surface roughness of the hybrid electrode, which further boost the ion transfer efficiency. The excellent cycle performance of the nanohybrid is due to the high conductivity of CDs and the network of the special porous structure in the hybrid. A CD-mediated manganese oxide decorated graphene nanosheets (MnOx–CDG) nanostructure based flexible solid-state supercapacitor was demonstrated by Unnikrishnan et al., as shown in Fig. 21. This solid state supercapacitor exhibited good capacitance properties (specific capacitance ∼ 280 F g−1) with outstanding charge–discharge cycle stability (>10000 cycles) and good capacitance retention at 90° bending angle. The presence of high porosity, charge transport and ionic motion during the charge–discharge process also ultimately improved the rate capability.
Very recently, Wei et al. fabricated a series of CD/NiCo2O4 nanohybrids with various morphologies for high performance supercapacitor application. The optimal nanohybrid exhibited high specific capacitance (2168 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and superior rate performance (75.2% up to current density 30 A g−1). The device fabricated using the optimal nanohybrid exhibited a high specific capacitance of 138.8 F g−1 corresponding to a high energy density of 62.0 W h kg−1, as well as the hybrid device showed 99.96% capacity retention rate after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 30 A g−1. The electrochemical performance of the device is shown in Fig. 22. Such remarkable electrochemical performances of this CD/NiCo2O4 nanohybrid result from the unique structures as shown in Fig. 23. The high surface area and mesoporous architecture of the nanohybrids increase the interface area of the electrode/electrolyte and provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. The surface structures of the nanohybrid spheres also facilitate the ion diffusion and electron transport, which improve the rate performances of the nanohybrid. In comparison with nanoneedles (urchin and chestnut structures with CDs incorporation of 0 and 0.25 mg mL−1), nanopetals (CDs incorporation of 0.5 mg mL−1) and nanodots (CDs incorporation of 0.5 mg mL−1) provide a shorter path for the carrier transfer, so that the latter two samples exhibited better rate performances. All of the four structures were beneficial for relaxing the volume expansion and relieving the structural damage during the cycles.
On the other hand, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are also favorable power source devices, which have been extensively used in electronics and electric vehicles because of their benefits of high capacity and environmental benignity. A CDs coated Mn3O4 nanohybrid (Mn3O4/CD) obtained through a green alternating voltage electrochemical approach (Fig. 24a) was reported by Jing et al. for an anode material in lithium ion batteries. The nanohybrid exhibited excellent electrochemical performances with an enhanced reversible discharge capacity of 934 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 which is almost five times higher than that of pure Mn3O4. The charge and discharge curves of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4/CD nanohybrid at different current densities with a voltage from 0.01 V to 3.0 V are shown in Fig. 24b. An identical phase transition reaction occurs for Li+ charge/discharge at a relatively high current density as the reversible capacities of the Mn3O4/CD nanohybrid are gradually decreased with the increase of current densities, but the shape of the voltage plateaus at various current densities remains almost the same. The rate capabilities of Mn3O4 and the Mn3O4/CD nanohybrid are shown in Fig. 24c, where it is clearly seen that the nanohybrid exhibits much better rate performance than pure Mn3O4 nanoparticles. This demonstrates that the electrical conductivity of Mn3O4 can be improved by introducing CDs. The Mn3O4/CD nanohybrid exhibited a reversible capacity of 492 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 500 mA g−1, which is much higher than the theoretical specific capacity of the graphite electrode (372 mA h g−1). Fig. 24d shows the cycle performance of pure Mn3O4 and Mn3O4/CD nanohybrid electrodes at a current density of 100 mA g−1, where the nanohybrid electrode displays much better cycling stability than the pure Mn3O4 electrode. Here the presence of CDs on the surface of Mn3O4 makes the nanohybrid lipophilic, which facilitates the penetration of electrolytes and ion transfer. Therefore, both the electrical conductivity and charge transfer are enhanced.
Yang et al. utilized CD supported nitrogen doped TiO2 nanorods (N-TiO2/CD) in both types of batteries, LIBs and SIBs. The hybrid anode material for LIBs can sustain a capacity of 185 mA h g−1 with 91.6% retention even at a high rate of 10C over 1000 cycles as shown in Fig. 25. The CV plots (Fig. 25a) of pure N-TiO2 and N-TiO2/CD nanohybrid electrodes reveal that the polarization is decreased with CD decoration. In both cases, three pairs of peaks observed near 1.69/2.06 V can be assigned to Li insertion/extraction into anatase TiO2, and two pairs of peaks at approximately 1.48/1.56 V and 1.54/1.65 V are characteristic of Li insertion/extraction into TiO2-B. Moreover, CV curves show a broad feature, which are characteristic of surface/interfacial Li+ storage contributed by the low-dimension N-TiO2 with high surface area. In GCD analysis (Fig. 25b and c), the discharge curves for the pure N-TiO2 and N-TiO2/CD electrodes demonstrate three different voltage regions, including the homogeneous Li+ insertion into the bulk TiO2 (>1.75 V), the diffusion-controlled intercalation of Li+ occurring within the anatase phase (∼1.75 V) and the slope region associated with the surface-confined charge-transfer process in the TiO2(B) phase and the surface/interfacial Li+ intercalation at the surface/interface of these nanomaterials (fast double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance, <1.75 V). From the comparative cycle and rate performances (Fig. 25d–f) between the N-TiO2/CD and N-TiO2 it is found that the nanohybrid exhibited much better performance than the pure N-TiO2. The hybrid anode materials for SIBs also exhibited excellent electrochemical performances, including substantial cycling stabilities (the capacity retention ratio after 300 cycles at 5C was 93.6%) and remarkable rate capabilities (176 mA h g−1 at 5C, 131 mA h g−1 at 20C) as shown in Fig. 26. The Na-ion insertion–extraction behaviors of N-TiO2/CD and pure N-TiO2 investigated through CV and GCD analyses are shown in Fig. 26a–c. Fig. 26d–f show the excellent rate capability, cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of N-TiO2/CD compared to the pure N-TiO2. This enhanced electrochemical performance in both LIBs and SIBs for the nanohybrid compared to the pure N-TiO2 was due to the enhanced electrical conductivity and faster charge-transfer after incorporating CDs. The EIS results (Fig. 27) also indicate that the charge transfer resistance of N-TiO2/CD in an LIB is 17 ohm, which is about two times lower than that of N-TiO2 (ca. 30 ohm). Similarly in an SIB, the charge transfer resistance of N-TiO2/CD (ca. 152 ohm) is about three times lower than that of N-TiO2 (ca. 480 ohm). These results clearly indicate that CDs improve the electrical conductivity and charge transfer reactions.
Recently, Balogun et al. also designed a new type of free-standing CDs coated VO2 (VO2/CD) interwoven nanowires through a simple fabrication process and demonstrated their potential application as a cathode material for LIBs and SIBs. The surface engineering of CDs serves the function of protecting the nanowire surface and plays an important role in the diffusion of electrons. Also, the 3-D carbon cloth coated with VO2 interwoven nanowires assisted in the diffusion of ions through the inner and the outer surface. Thus the CD nanosurface engineered VO2 electrode with the unique architecture exhibited capacities of 420 and 328 mA h g−1 at a current density rate of 0.3C for LIB and SIB, respectively.

Recently, CDs based photochemical and electrochemical sensors have gained tremendous attention due to the interesting photo-induced electron transfer and electrochemical charge transfer properties of CDs. Furthermore, CD–metal based nanohybrids are becoming an interesting research topic in the field of sensors because of their excellent static and dynamic fluorescence quenching; and excellent electrocatalytic performance. Li et al. designed non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors based on a CD/octahedral cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanohybrid for the detection of glucose and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The amperometric sensing of glucose is realized with good selectivity and a linear response range varied from 0.02 to 4.3 mM with a detection limit of 8.4 μM (S/N = 3). The nonenzymatic sensor also exhibits a linear response range from 5 μM to 5.3 mM with a detection limit of 2.8 μM (S/N = 3) to the electrocatalytic reduction of H2O2. Fig. 28a–c show the CV curves of the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the octahedral Cu2O/Nafion/GCE and the CD/octahedral Cu2O/Nafion/GCE in the absence and presence of H2O2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, where a strong redox couple is located between −0.3 and −0.02 V in both modified electrodes. The anodic and cathodic peaks can be ascribed to the oxidation of Cu2O to CuO and the reduction of CuO to Cu2O. Fig. 28d shows the CV curves of the bare GCE, octahedral Cu2O/Nafion/GCE and the CD/octahedral Cu2O/Nafion/GCE in the presence of 0.6 mM H2O2, where the electrocatalytic ability of CD/octahedral Cu2O is found to be much better than that of octahedral Cu2O. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (Fig. 28e) clearly indicate that the electron transfer resistance of CD/octahedral Cu2O is much less than that of octahedral Cu2O. Thus, CD/octahedral Cu2O/Nafion/GCE exhibited higher electrochemical activity than the bare GCE and octahedral Cu2O/Nafion/GCE.

A robust reusable fluoride sensor based on highly fluorescent CDs and magnetically separable nickel ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) complex bound-silica coated magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2–EDTA–Ni) has been reported by Mohapatra et al. The main principle of this sensor is the exchange reaction between CDs and F−, which induces the binding of fluoride to the magnetic receptor. The method is highly sensitive, fast, and selective for fluoride ion in aqueous solution with the linear response range of fluoride (R2 = 0.992) and the minimum detection limits are found to be 1–20 and 0.06 μM, respectively. Here, the PL property of CDs is used for the fluorescence monitoring of fluoride ion and the magnetic nature of the receptor is used for the recovery and reusability of the nanosensor. Fig. 29a shows that CDs exhibit a strong fluorescence signal at 420 nm at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm, which sharply declines after addition of Fe3O4@SiO2–EDTA–Ni to the aqueous solution of CDs. This is due to the binding of CDs to the magnetic receptor, which leads to fluorescence quenching by lowering of the CD level available in the analytical sample. However, on addition of the fluoride ion fluorescence intensity is recovered again and the PL intensity of CDs increases gradually with the increase of the concentration of F−. This is because of the replacement of the bound CDs in the solution by F−. Different concentrations of F− (1 μM to 1 mM) are used to evaluate the sensitivity of the system, and it is observed that 95% of the fluorescence intensity is recovered after addition of 1 mM F−. The relative intensity (F/F0) against fluoride concentration shows good linearity in the range 1–20 μM with R2 = 0.992 (Fig. 29c). The limit of detection is found to be 0.06 μM. Fig. 29d clearly indicates that the fluorescent intensity increases from time zero to about 15 min and remains constant when equilibrium is established. The suggested mechanism of this fluorescence sensing is that the –COOH groups on the surface of CDs interact with the positively charged Ni center and free amine groups present on the magnetic receptor through electrostatic interactions, which ultimately leads to diminished fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity is recovered on addition of F− due to its high binding affinity to the receptor. After adding F−, it occupies the binding sites and thus replaces CDs in the analytical solution.
Some strategies tune the surface chemistry of CDs by introducing heteroatoms through doping and functionalization. In these approaches edge groups, like carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, are used as reactive sites. The carboxyl groups induce non-radiative recombination of e−/h+ pairs, where the functionalization of CDs with amine groups decreases surface defects and consequently diminishes the non-radiative recombination process, resulting in fluorescence enhancement and a photoluminescence blue shift. Recently, PAMAM-NH2 dendrimer functionalized CDs (CD@PAMAM-NH2) have been used as a fluorescent ratiometric nanosensor for explosive nitrocompounds.Fig. 30a shows the effect of different chloronitroaniline compounds, 4C-2,6DNA, 6C-2,4DNA, 2,5DC-4NA and 2,6DC-4NA on the fluorescence spectra of CD@PAMAM-NH2. The spectra clearly depict that these species quenched the fluorescence in a noticeable way. Interestingly, the addition of 4-chloro-2,6-dinitroaniline (4C-2,6DNA) quenched the fluorescence of CD@PAMAM-NH2 differently compared to the other three compounds. The spectra have a unique emission band at 507 nm, which emerges at the expense of the decrease in the intensity of the band at 465 nm. On the other hand, the two shoulders of the emission bands at 465 and 507 nm decreased at different ratios because of the presence of 4C-2,6DNA that quenches the emission. The correlation between the intensity ratios of the emission at 465 nm and that at 507 nm (I465/I507) is shown in Fig. 30b. The quenching of CD@PAMAM-NH2 fluorescence by 4C-2,6DNA is rapid and sensitive to the presence of the target molecule, even at a very low concentration. The fluorescence quenching of CD@PAMAM-NH2 by 4C-2,6DNA is due to the charge transfer process. The maximum absorption band of 4C-2,6DNA at 440 nm overlaps with the emission band of CD@PAMAM-NH2, which gives rise to an energy transfer process. This results in the formation of a complex (Meisenheimer complex) in which the negative charge is delocalized over the cyclohexadienyl ring and the nitro group, whereas the positive charge is distributed over an iminium group, as shown in Fig. 30c. The formation of such a complex with amino groups is typical of nitroaromatic compounds, and here the amine groups of the PAMAM-NH2 dendrimer contribute to this complexation. The two electron-withdrawing nitro groups of 4C-2,6DNA make the aniline ring a poor electron donor, but electron-rich enough to form a stable complex, which is observed at 507 nm. Gao et al. reported a poly(amidoamine) dendrimer-capped CD/Au nanocrystal based nanohybrid (PAMAM-CD/Au) to fabricate a simple, label-free and ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The fabricated immunosensor showed high sensitivity, good repeatability and wide dynamic response to AFP. The amine-rich PAMAM played roles in passivating the surface of CDs as well as participating in the reduction of HAuCl4. Here, the main role of CDs is to accelerate the electron transfer process between the sensing interface and the electrode. In Fig. 30d, the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) curve shows the decrease of peak currents with the increment of AFP concentration. The calibration plots show a linear relationship in the range from 100 fg mL−1 to 100 ng mL−1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.996 and the detection limit for AFP is found to be 0.025 pg mL−1 (S/N = 3).

This article reviewed the recent progress in CD–metal based nanohybrids and their photochemical and electrochemical applications. The intentional research on CDs started in 2006, though it was discovered accidentally in the year 2004. Now it is widely entering in almost all aspects of materials science. The interesting up-conversion photoluminescence, photo-induced electron/hole or charge transfer properties of CDs make it a highly efficient and tunable nanomaterial for photocatalysis, solar cell or photoelectric, photodetector, energy storage or harvesting, photochemical and electrochemical sensor applications along with the metal based nanoparticles. A large number of CD–metal based nanohybrids have been prepared through different approaches and their application spectrum has also been widened. However, still the progress of research on CD–metal based nanohybrids remains in its early stage as compared to graphene based metal nanohybrids. Still many issues are waiting to be resolved for further development of CDs as well as their nanohybrids. The photoluminescence spectrum of CDs is generally too wide due to the large heterogeneity of the synthesized products. Thus, a genuine need to develop a better understanding of the tunable photoluminescence properties, controllable and scalable synthesis and surface engineering is very much expected from researchers in the field. The mechanisms of photoluminescence, up-conversion photoluminescence, electron and charge transfer demand for more studies and clarification. The electrical conductivity and crystallinity of CD based nanomaterials still remain as shortcomings for advanced electrochemical applications. More research needs to be performed on CD based nanohybrids in energy storage and harvesting applications like graphene based nanohybrid materials. However, early research clearly demonstrated the enormous potential of CD–metal based nanohybrids in the photochemical and electrochemical fields. Therefore, this review article tried to establish the recent progress in the field and also urged researchers to go further in the development and practical applications of CD based metal nanohybrids. In a nut-shell, a strong and collaborative interdisciplinary platform is very much essential for genuine exploitation of this novel material in various fields.
