Four novel methacrylate-based side chain donor–π-conjugated–acceptor (D–π–A) type polymers (AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4) were synthesized via free radical polymerization. Variations in the optical, redox and photovoltaic characteristics were introduced by the substitution of different electron-deficient groups and the polymers were employed in the triphenylamine–acridone system. These new push–pull systems are based on acridone (as a π-spacer), several electron-withdrawing anchoring/acceptor groups (malononitrile (MN), nitrobenzene (NB), picolinic acid (PA) and tetrazole (Tz)) and triphenylamine (TPA) as the donor group. A multidisciplinary study concerning the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic performances of the polymers reveals that the polymer bearing tetrazole acceptor group (AT-P4) exhibited the best overall conversion efficiency (4.20%) as a sensitizer in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2).

Modern civilization requires continued and sustainable economic growth to cope with ever-growing problems related to an explosion in world population and depleting fossil energy resources. As increasing demand for energy has attracted a growing interest in environmentally benign alternative energy sources, researchers have focused on solar energy due to its sustainability and ease of access. Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) and particularly dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a considerable scientific research attention in the past two decades as promising candidates for the next generation of solar cells due to their low manufacturing cost, flexibility of molecular design and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). To date, the commonly designed configuration of metal-free conjugated polymers is based on a donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) architecture, which is a key element in a DSSC device. This type of push–pull systems show efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) properties. In these systems, small variations in different parts of the molecule (mostly in the donor and the acceptor groups) play a crucial role in light-harvesting and electron injection, which greatly influence the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. To date, the PCEs of solar cells (using small molecules as donors) have exceeded 8%, making these materials ideal candidates for the solution-processed DSSCs.

Over the last few decades, various functional groups and their derivatives have been introduced as electron donors or acceptors. Triphenylamine derivatives are excellent electron donors due to their electron-donating properties and nonplanar molecular configurations, which prevents aggregation. In general, a strong electron withdrawing (EW) group near the anchoring site is required to pull the electron density from the donor fragment, thereby narrowing the band-gap through the mixing of donor–acceptor orbitals. This imparts absorption in the longer wavelength region and is thought to facilitate the electron injection into TiO2 substrates, as observed for several D–π–A molecules. Recently, electron-withdrawing anchoring groups, such as malononitrile, nitrobenzene, picolinic acid and tetrazole linked by acridone, have been introduced as alternative and efficient acceptor units in DSSCs; however, no studies comparing their properties have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, these species have not been utilized as sensitizers for DSSCs. These studies have led the authors to suggest that there is a more effective electron transport to the acceptor, which can be injected into the conduction band of a semiconductor through linking acridone to the anchoring acceptor units.
In the present study, a series of four new metal-free D–π–A type side chain polymethacrylates, AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4, with malononitrile, nitrobenzene, picolinic acid and tetrazole functionalized acridone moieties as the acceptor/anchoring groups and triphenylamine as donor, were designed and synthesized for DSSCs. The structure of the polymer is expected to enhance the adsorption of the sensitizer on the electrode surface and improve the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. The introduction of an acridone unit in the middle of the side chain also increases the planarity and improves the charge transport properties of the resultant materials. The schematic molecular structures of the polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 are given in Fig. 1.

Molecular weights and the polydispersity indices (PDIs) of polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were determined by a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) against polystyrene standards with THF as the eluent. Number average molecular weights (Mn) of 15400, 14900, 17500 and 22300 were obtained for AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4, respectively, with PDIs in the range of 1.43–1.90. The polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were analysed by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The initial decomposition temperatures (IDT) of polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were 238, 226, 218 and 231 °C, respectively. The polymers demonstrated high decomposition temperatures (Td, 10% weight loss) of 277, 264, 258, and 271 °C for AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4, respectively (Fig. S1). Degradation of the polymers occurred in two stages. The first stage of decomposition (290–430 °C) occurred due to the cleavage of the pendant substituted acridone, whereas the second stage (480–730 °C) of decomposition occurred due to the cleavage of the main chain bonds. TGA thermograms revealed that these two distinct behaviours depend on the substituted/acridone and triphenylamine ring substituents. Therefore, the incorporation of different anchoring units (bonded to acridone–triphenylamine in the polymer backbone) changed the rigidity and planarity of the molecule, thereby affecting the thermal properties of the polymers. The glass transition temperatures (Tg °C) of polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 and were found to be in the range of 88–110 °C (Fig. S2 and Table 1). All the polymers exhibited reasonably good thermal stability, as shown in Table 1. These results indicated that triphenylamine–acridone, containing side chain methacrylate polymers, possessed a high thermal stability, which could be exploited for photovoltaic cells (PVC) and other optoelectronic devices.

To determine the acceptor and π-spacer effects on the optical properties of acridone–triphenylamine containing polymethacrylates, the photophysical features were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption measurements in diluted DMF solutions (10−5 M). The optical parameters deduced from these spectral studies are summarized in Table 2 and their corresponding spectra are displayed in Fig. 2(a). All the synthesized polymers exhibited two distinct absorption bands: one weak band in the ultraviolet region (310–380 nm) corresponding to the π–π* electronic transitions and one strong absorption band lying in the visible region (430–550 nm) that was assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor unit and the acceptor end group. The absorption spectra were red-shifted (∼30 nm) and expanded when the acridone π-bridge was introduced to the polymers (AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4), which clearly indicated that the insertion of the acridone unit in between the donor and acceptor increased the π-bridge length and also the electron withdrawing nature of the acceptor group. In addition, compared with AT-P1 and AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 showed higher absorption intensities between 430 and 510 nm, which could be assigned to the efficient intramolecular charge transfers arising from the π-conjugation of PA/Tz (anchoring acceptor group) with the triphenylamine moiety. The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) for AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 are located at 438, 455, 468 and 470 nm, respectively. This property may be responsible for enhancing the light harvesting ability and photocurrent generation in DSSC. Among the synthesized polymers, those with PA and Tz as acceptors (AT-P3 and AT-P4) showed high maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) and had the highest molar extension coefficients (ε) when compared to the polymers with MN (AT-P1) and NB (AT-P2) as acceptors. This may be due to the extension of π-conjugated system, resulting from the strong electron withdrawing ability of tetrazole and picolinic acid. The optical band gaps (E0–0) determined from the onset of the optical absorption were 2.53, 2.32, 2.26 and 2.23 eV for AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4, respectively, and are illustrated in Table 2. Due to the change in the electron withdrawing nature of the acceptors, the band gap of the synthesized polymers decreased, which may be responsible for the broadening of the absorption band and higher light harvesting efficiency.

Interaction with the TiO2 surface: the functionalization of the nanoparticulate TiO2 thin films with polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 was evidenced by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Absorption spectra of the polymers adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface are shown in Fig. 2(b), and the corresponding λmax values are listed in Table 2. Regardless of the anchoring mode, the presence of a broad absorption band in the visible region indicates an effective photosensitization of the oxide layer by the chromophores. A similar trend was observed for tetrazole (AT-P4) and picolinic acid (AT-P3) bearing polymers upon grafting onto the TiO2 surface. In both cases, a blue shift of λmax was observed (∼45 nm), attributable to the deprotonation of the dye molecules and their interaction with the metal oxide. However, very little variation was observed in the absorption spectra of AT-P1 and AT-P2 thin films (only ∼15 nm), suggesting a different interaction mode with TiO2 compared to AT-P3 and AT-P4.

The electrochemical properties of the side chain D–π–A polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a solution of 0.1 M TBAP in a DMF medium to illustrate the thermodynamic feasibility of the electron injection from the excited polymeric dye molecule to the TiO2 conduction band, as well as the dye regeneration through the electrolyte. The CV data are summarized and presented in Table 2, and the representative cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 3. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the polymers can be calculated from the onset oxidation potential [Eox (onset)] based on the ferrocene reference energy level (4.8 eV below the vacuum level), using the following relationship: HOMO = −[Eonsetox − EFC + 4.8] eV, where EFC (calculated 0.53 V vs. Ag electrode) is the potential of the ferrocene/ferricenium ion (Fc/Fc+) couple used as the internal standard. The oxidation potentials (Eox) of AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were 0.68, 0.74, 0.79 and 0.88 V, respectively. All the polymers showed one irreversible peak arising from the oxidation potential around 0.60–0.90 V, which was due to the removal of an electron from the donor amine moiety. The HOMO values of the polymers were found to be between −4.95 and −5.15 eV (lower than the I−/I3− redox couple; −4.6 eV vs. vacuum), indicating that the oxidized polymeric dye molecules formed after the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 could be regenerated by the reducing species in the electrolyte solution. The energy band-gaps (E0–0) between HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra for AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4; they were found to be 2.53, 2.32, 2.26 and 2.23 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated by the addition of the optical band-gap (E0–0) and HOMO; the LUMO levels were estimated to be −2.42, −2.69, −2.80 and −2.92 V.

The schematic energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) of the synthesized dyes, the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of I−/I3− are illustrated in Fig. 4. Inserting the acridone unit as a π-spacer between the donor moiety and the anchoring group may have been beneficial in bringing down the LUMO energy level closer to the TiO2 conduction band and lifting up the HOMO energy level closer to the electrolyte potential, thereby narrowing the band-gap in the synthesized polymeric dyes. The calculated LUMO levels of the polymers were found to be in the range from −2.42 to −2.92 eV, which is sufficiently more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vacuum), suggesting a sufficient driving force for the electron injection from the excited polymeric dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, the electrochemical parameters suggested that these organic polymeric dyes could be efficiently used as good sensitizers in DSSCs.

Favorable characteristics emerged concerning the light harvesting capabilities and potential photovoltaic properties of the polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4. The photovoltaic characteristics of the fabricated DSSCs were sensitized with the synthesized polymeric dyes on nanocrystalline TiO2 films and using an electrolyte consisting of 0.05 M I2/0.5 M LiI/0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile solution. The performance parameters of the DSSCs under sun-simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding solar cell parameters, such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), efficiency (η), and other relevant data, are listed in Table 3. According to Fig. 5, it is clear that the efficiency of the fabricated DSSCs can be affected by the anchoring-acceptor groups and π-bridge modification in the synthesized polymer molecules. Compared to polymers AT-P1 and AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 polymer based DSSCs showed higher efficiencies due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of tetrazole and picolinic acid acceptor units, as well as their electron injection ability into the TiO2 conduction band.

Furthermore, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the fabricated DSSCs is plotted in Fig. 6, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 3. The IPCE spectra for all four polymers exhibited a broad spectral response over a large wavelength range (Fig. 6), indicating that all the polymeric dyes efficiently converted visible light into photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 6, AT-P4 and AT-P3 exhibited a better IPCE performance than the other two polymers, with IPCE values exceeding 25–40% in the 470 to 530 nm region and a maximum value of 37% at 520 nm. This result was highly consistent with the Jsc value obtained by J–V measurements. Moreover, AT-P1 and AT-P2 exhibited maximum IPCE values of 27% at 520 nm and 29% at 470 nm, respectively. Impressively, AT-P3 and AT-P4 (with more electron-deficient acceptors) showed much broader IPCE responses than the other two sensitizers. The IPCE as a function of wavelength is directly related to the light-harvesting efficiency, charge injection efficiency and charge collection efficiency. In addition, the HOMO levels were similar for each of the polymers (AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4). Therefore, the better IPCE performance of polymers in the order AT-P4 > AT-P3 > AT-P2 > AT-P1 should be ascribed to the introduction of different anchoring acceptor groups, which interrupted the intermolecular interactions and thus improved the electron injection efficiency. These results confirmed the higher Jsc values obtained for devices based on AT-P4 and AT-P3, with a broad and roughly constant photoresponse (∼37%, ∼33%) in the range between 510 and 530 nm. Polymers AT-P4 and AT-P3 presented maximum IPCE values of 37% and 33% at 510 and 530 nm and the highest Voc values (0.82 V, respectively) of all the molecules studied, suggesting a decrease in the charge recombination processes for these molecules. Obviously, the introduction of acridone as a π-bridge and tetrazole/picolinic acid units as acceptors was favourable for suppressing dye aggregation on the TiO2 films and also improved the electron injection efficiencies, thus AT-P4 and AT-P3 show the highest open voltage (Voc) of 0.76 and 0.82 V, respectively. As a result, AT-P4 and AT-P3 demonstrated DSSC efficiencies of 4.20% and 3.91%, respectively, higher than those of AT-P1 and AT-P2.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted to further elucidate the effect of acceptor and π-bridge modification on the synthesized polymers for DSSCs. The results of EIS illustrated the kinetics of the charge transfer processes at the interfaces of the fabricated DSSCs, such as charge recombination at the TiO2/polymeric dye/electrolyte interface, electron transport in the TiO2 electrode, electron transfer at the counter electrode, and I3− transport in the electrolyte. The impedance spectra (Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots) of fabricated DSSCs based on AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 polymers are shown in Fig. 7(a). In the Nyquist plots, the observed semicircle corresponds to the electron transfer resistance at the TiO2/polymeric dye/electrolyte interface. The semicircle with larger radius indicated a huge electron transfer resistance, increasing in the order AT-P2 < AT-P1 < AT-P3 < AT-P4, and a slower charge recombination between TiO2 and electrolyte. EIS analysis revealed that the introduction of the acridone moiety suppressed the charge recombination arising from the electrons in the TiO2 films with I3− ions in the electrolyte, thus considerably improving the open-circuit voltage (Voc). In addition, the electron recombination lifetime (τ) values were calculated from the Bode phase plots (Fig. 7(b)) for polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 as 9.81, 10.57, 12.29 and 15.96 ms, respectively. The relatively higher electron lifetimes of AT-P3 and AT-P4 sensitized DSSCs indicated that the introduction of picolinic acid and tetrazole units (bonded to the acridone acceptors) can effectively suppress the recombination of injected electrons with I3− in the electrolyte, which may have enhanced the photo-voltage, photocurrent and the device efficiency.


All reagents were utilized as received without further purification. Solvents were treated by standard methods. The NMR spectra were obtained by a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. FT-IR spectra were obtained in the 4000–400 cm−1 range by a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR spectrometer RXI using KBr pellets. UV-visible spectra were obtained by a UV-1650PC UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Fluorescence measurements were performed using an LS-55 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the polymer was carried out by a Mettler 851e TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The molecular weights and the corresponding polydispersity index values of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with tetrahydrofuran as an eluent and mono disperse polystyrene standards used for calibration. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to obtain GC-MS spectra by JEOL GCMATE II GC-MS. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were obtained by an AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, measured in a acetonitrile–dichloromethane (MeCN–DCM; 3:1, v/v) solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) as a supporting electrolyte (working electrode: glassy carbon; counter electrode: Pt; reference electrode: non-aqueous Ag/Ag+) under an argon atmosphere. The redox potentials were calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal standard. Electrical impedance spectra (EIS) under dark with bias 4.8 eV were also obtained using an AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation at frequencies of 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz at the open circuit potential (OCP).


A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO; sheet resistance 10 Ω sq. cm−1; bought from BHEL, INDIA) was cleaned with double distilled water and acetone. The prepared titania (TiO2) paste was coated on the cleaned conducting glass substrate according to the described method (reported in the literature) for the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells. The active area was 1 × 1 cm2. After heating the TiO2 thin film up to 80 °C, the film was soaked in a DMF solution containing 0.4 mM polymeric sensitizers for 24 h at room temperature to allow the dye to be adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. A platinized FTO was prepared by the chemical deposition of 0.05 M hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) in isopropanol, which acted as a counter electrode. After being rinsed with DMF, the photoanode was placed on the top of the counter electrode and tightly clipped together to form a cell. The electrolyte was composed of 0.05 M iodine (I2), 0.5 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile, which was injected in between the two electrodes. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode, the Pt counter-electrode and the electrolyte solution were assembled into a sealed sandwich type solar cell.

The photoelectrochemical characterizations were performed using a modified light source: 300 W Xenon Arc Lamp (Oriel, 6258) equipped with an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel, 81080 kit). The light intensity was 100 mW cm−2. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V curves) characteristics of the DSSCs were obtained using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat-84610. IPCE spectra of the solar cells were obtained as a function of wavelength under monochromatic irradiation with an Enlitech QE-T spectral response measurement system. The number of incident photons was calculated for each wavelength using a calibrated monocrystalline silicon solar reference cell (RC-S103011-E).

The synthetic routes for the polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 are shown in Scheme 1. TPA, AT1-4, monomers AT-M(1-4) and polymers AT-P(1-4) were synthesized according to the reported methods. Their 1H and 13C NMR spectra were consistent with the references. TPA was prepared by an Ullmann coupling reaction. ATPA was prepared by refluxing TPA, acridone, K3PO4/CuI/1 and 2-diaminocyclohexane in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 24 h under nitrogen atmosphere. The as-obtained ATPA was treated with the appropriate compound (MN, NB, PA or Tz) by condensation reactions to generate the precursors AT1-4 with the desired core triphenylamine–acridone. Esterification of the precursors AT1-4 using methacryloyl chloride afforded a methacrylate containing monomers AT-M(1-4). Finally, the desired polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were synthesized via free radical polymerization reactions using 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator. The synthetic procedures and NMR data of the new polymers, monomers and intermediates are given in the ESI.


Starting from the commercially available reagents and using simple and convenient procedures, metal free side chain D–π–A type methacrylate-based polymers AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 were designed and synthesized to investigate the effects of the anchoring electron-withdrawing groups on the light-harvesting, redox properties and performance of DSSC sensitizers. For the first time, new electron-deficient building blocks for D–π–A polymers, malononitrile (MN), nitrobenzene (NB), picolinic acid (PA) and tetrazole (Tz) bonded to acridone were introduced as acceptor/anchoring moieties as well as π-bridges. From the optical, redox and photovoltaic measurement results, the incorporation of acridone π-linker bonded with different electron-withdrawing anchoring groups was superior in the broadening of the absorption band with high molar extinction coefficients and negative shift of LUMO levels, which may be a sufficient driving force for the electron injection from the excited polymeric dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. Among AT-P1, AT-P2, AT-P3 and AT-P4 polymers, the tetrazole and picolinic acid bearing polymers (AT-P4 and AT-P3) showed maximum efficiencies of 4.20% and 3.91%. Consequently, this work indicates that tetrazole/picolinic acid-substituted acridone is one of the most promising electron-withdrawing anchoring/acceptor groups for the efficient D–π–A dye sensitizers.
