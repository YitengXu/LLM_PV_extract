Over the last ten years, the molecular architectures of p-type donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers designed for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaics, when mixed with fullerenes or n-type polymers, have progressed substantially from one-dimensional (1-D) to branched to two-dimensional (2-D) D–A conjugated structures. In the 1-D structures, alternating D and A units allow internal charge transfer along the conjugated backbone and increase the effective resonance length, as a result of facilitated π-electron delocalization. Upon progressing from 1-D structures to branched D–A conjugated polymers (comprising repeating donor units in the main chain with electron-withdrawing side chain units) to 2-D conjugated polymers (having D–A repeating units on their backbones as well as perpendicular electron-donating groups on their D units), the solubility, effective conjugation length, and photophysical and BHJ photovoltaic properties have all been altered dramatically. The ideal p-type 2-D conjugated D–A polymer for use in BHJ photovoltaic devices should possess a low band gap (to broaden the absorption range), excellent packing characteristics (particularly along the out-of-plane direction, ensuring good carrier transport), and suitable energy levels for efficient electron transfer (to fullerene moieties or n-type polymers). In this review, we discuss the effects of the structural characteristics and optical properties of these conjugated polymers as well as their packing characteristics on the device performances.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is a promising technology for the production of renewable energy, with the attraction of allowing the formation of large-area devices on flexible substrates through simple solution processing. In the current field of OPVs, the most prevalent and efficient active layer design is the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, comprising nanometer-scale-phase-separated blends of p- and n-type materials (defined in terms of their relative differences in electron affinity; e.g., polymers and fullerenes, respectively) that generate large interfacial areas. The fundamental mechanism of photon-to-electron conversion in a BHJ OPV device involves four sequential steps, each with its own conversion efficiency; the overall OPV efficiency is effectively the product of all these four independent step-efficiencies together. First, upon the absorption of a photon, an electron in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymer undergoes photoinduced excitation, moving to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polymer, forming a Frenkel exciton comprising a coulombically bound electron and hole. Second, some of the generated excitons can diffuse to the p–n (e.g., polymer–fullerene) interfaces within the diffusion length. Third, an exciton at the p–n interface that is subjected to the built-in internal field undergoes charge transfer (CT) at an ultrafast pace (ca. 100 fs) to form a CT exciton, where the hole and electron remain in the p- and n-type materials, respectively, held together through coulombic attraction. Fourth, the CT exciton dissociates into a free hole and electron, which are then transported through the p- and n-type materials, respectively, in the BHJ layer, to the anode and cathode, respectively, within a period of time ranging from nano- to microseconds. Because CT at the p–n interface is highly efficient, the most critical aspects affected by the polymer structure (p-type material) are the band gap (photoinduced excitation) of the polymer and the packing of the polymer (carrier transport) in the active layer. In this review, we focus on the effects of the molecular architectures of polymers on their band gaps and packing orientations.

The band gap of the polymer in the active layer largely determines the energy and amount of photons that the active layer can absorb (we note, however, that some fullerene derivatives also absorb a minor portion of the solar spectrum). Therefore, designing suitable polymer structures that absorb the maximum amount of photons remains a major approach toward the production of highly efficient OPVs. An effective way for tuning the band gap of the polymer is to give it a molecular structure in which an electron-rich donor (D) unit is conjugated with an electron-withdrawing acceptor (A) unit—herein termed a “D–A conjugated polymer”; such a D–A conjugated structure induces intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the D and A units, with the strength of ICT depending on the relative electron affinities of the two units. Because of the rigid nature of conjugated structures, D–A polymers typically pack into crystalline or ordered structures. The packing orientations of conjugated polymer molecules are, however, affected by their molecular architectures, which also affect their carrier (hole) transport, thereby influencing the photocurrents and efficiencies of the resulting OPV devices.
An ideal D–A conjugated polymer for BHJ photovoltaics would ideally exhibit four characteristics: (i) a suitable band gap to broaden the range of the absorbed solar spectrum; (ii) a molecular packing orientation that can conform to the direction of the electrodes to ensure good carrier transport; (iii) a low HOMO energy level to enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc); and (iv) a suitable LUMO energy level for efficient electron transfer to fullerene molecules. The backbone D–A repeating units of a conjugated polymer largely determine its HOMO and LUMO energy levels and, therefore, its band gap, although the side chains can also have influence to some extent. The molecular weight of the D–A polymer also has some influence on the band gap when it is below a threshold value (ca. Mn = 20000). Hence, a weak electron-donating unit conjugated to a strong electron-withdrawing unit is necessary to simultaneously decrease the HOMO energy level and band gap of a D–A conjugated polymer that results in simultaneously increasing the value of Voc and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the resulting device when blending the polymer with fullerenes. A relatively low photocurrent arises in an OPV device mainly from a relatively large optical gap of a molecule that absorbs a relatively small portion of the solar spectrum, typically 1.5–2 eV (cf. 1.1 eV for silicon). Therefore, it is necessary to develop D–A conjugated polymers with suitable band gaps to extend the absorption of light from the visible and into the infrared.

Fig. 1 displays the energy levels of D and A units and their corresponding D–A conjugated polymer. Based on the molecular perturbation theory, the HOMOs of the D and A units will interact to produce two hybrid HOMOs for the D–A conjugated polymer; similarly, two hybrid LUMOs will arise for the D–A conjugated polymer from the LUMOs of the D and A units. The redistribution of electrons from their original orbitals to the newly hybridized orbitals results in a higher lying hybrid HOMO and a lower lying hybrid LUMO, relative to that of the individual D and A units. Alternating D and A units allows an internal CT process along the conjugated chain and, therefore, increases the effective conjugation area of the π-electrons, leading to tunable band gaps as a result of facilitated π-electron delocalization (i.e., through planarization).
Because there are not only structural variations in conjugated D, spacer, and A units that constitute D–A conjugated polymers but also torsion angles between these units, the effective conjugated band gaps are largely determined by the energies of five structural factors. Fig. 2 presents the five energy structural factors that can contribute to the band gap energy (Eg) of a D–A conjugated polymer. The bond length alternation energy factor (Eδ) is defined as the energy difference between the average lengths of the nominally single and double bonds along the linear π-conjugated backbone. The resonance energy factor (Eres) is the energy required to switch from the aromatic form to the quinoid form through delocalization of moving π-electrons along the conjugated chain—converting double bonds into single bonds and synchronously transforming single bonds into double bonds. The value of Eg decreases upon increasing the quinoid character and decreasing the value of Eδ. The energy factor for the rotational disorder around inter-angular single bonds (Eθ) represents the effect of the mean dihedral angle θ between consecutive units contributing to delocalization of π-electrons along the conjugated backbone. The energy factor Esub is related to modulating the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with electron-donating or -withdrawing substituents. The energy factor Eint, which represents the intermolecular interactions of multiple individual polymer chains, has a considerable impact on the magnitude of the band gap energy. The value of Eg of a material derived from a conjugated polymer can be expressed by the sum contribution of the energies of these five structural factors (see eqn (1)).
Eg = Eδ + Eres + Eθ + Esub + Eint

Since 2006, linear low bandgap one-dimensional (1-D) conjugated D–A polymers have been developed widely for BHJ OPVs. In 2007, branched conjugated D–A polymers, comprising main-chain D units and side-chain A units, were also developed for OPVs; this particular molecular architecture can facilitate exciton dissociation when a strong electron-withdrawing group is incorporated in the side chain, with the dissociated electrons sequentially transferring to the side chain and then to the fullerenes. The first two dimensional (2-D) conjugated polymer—polythiophenes with conjugated bi(thienylenevinylene) side chains—for the application in polymer solar cells were first developed in 2006. But not until 2010 and later, a variety of structural modifications were further performed on the D units of 1-D conjugated D–A polymers to evolve into 2-D conjugated D–A polymers, which were designed to not only have tunable solubility and band gaps but also a tendency toward out-of-plane packing, as we will explain later. Recently, photo-crosslinking of p-type polymers has also been developed to stabilize the active layer morphology to achieve OPVs with longer lifetimes.Fig. 3 provides schematic representations of the molecular architectures of conjugated D–A polymers. A 1-D conjugated D–A polymer having D and A units alternating on the backbone allows delocalization of π-electrons along the backbone or through an ICT process—the overlapped π-electron wave functions between adjacent units allow intramolecular carrier transport. On the other hand, a branched conjugated D–A polymer incorporating A units on the side chains and attached to the D units constituting the main chain can improve the electron-withdrawing ability and, thus, the dissociation of excitons. The 2-D conjugated D–A polymer structure is based on the concept of introducing additional D units, albeit short, normal to the original D units in the 1-D D–A structure, creating another direction of conjugation that is normal to the direction of the polymer main chain. In 2-D conjugated D–A polymers, the π-electrons can further delocalize along the conjugated chains in the normal direction (even over a short conjugation length) in addition to the main chain direction, increasing the co-planarity and conjugated area and ensuring more effective π-overlap between neighboring polymer chains than that in 1-D conjugated D–A polymers.
In this review, we discuss these three types of molecular architectures: 1-D conjugated D–A polymers (characterized by conjugated alternating D and A units that from a linear main chain); branched conjugated D–A polymers (characterized by conjugated D units in a linear main chain and side-chain A units conjugated to the D units); and 2-D conjugated D–A polymers [characterized by additional D1 units linearly conjugated to the backbone D units (D1–D conjugation), with normal alignment of D–A and D1–D conjugation]. We also focus on the packing orientations of these different types of polymer architectures.

Because of the rigid nature of conjugated D–A polymer structures, D–A polymers readily pack into crystalline or ordered structures with different orientations. If we consider a single conjugated polymer chain as a lamella, there are three possible types of lamellar orientations based on the geometry of the lamella: edge-on, face-on, and end-on. Here, we use the molecular packing of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an example to illustrate edge-on, face-on, and end-on orientations of a polymer that is used in various organic electronic devices (e.g., organic field-effect transistors and OPVs), as demonstrated later. Fig. 4(a)–(c) display edge-on, face-on, and end-on packing structures of P3HT, as well as their 2-D (qzvs. qy) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns. Most reports adopted the notation of the qxy axis rather than the qy axis in their representation owing to the fact that spin-cast samples contained crystalline domains distributed in the xy plane, and the incident X-ray beam could align with either the x- or y-axis. The reason why 2-D GIWAXS analysis is required to resolve the various molecular packing directions within an active layer is that the typical active layer is rather thin, usually having a thickness between 100 and 200 nm. Fig. 4(a) reveals the location of the (100) reflection in the out-of-plane (z) direction, qz, and the (010) reflection in the in-plane (y) direction, qy, in the 2-D GIWAXS pattern that can be used to determine the chain-to-chain (lamellar stacking) and conjugated plane-to-conjugated plane (π–π stacking) distances, respectively. The d-spacings of the chain-to-chain stacking and the π–π stacking can be calculated using the equations d(100) = 2π/q and d(010) = 2π/q, respectively, where q is the wavenumber of the (100) and (010) reflections in the out-of-plane (z) and in-plane (y) directions, respectively. Fig. 4(b) reveals that (100) and (010) reflections appear in qy and qz, respectively, for face-on packing of the conjugated polymer. For end-on packing [Fig. 4(c)], the absence of a reflection in qz and the presence of (100) and (010) reflections in qy indicate that both the edges and the faces of the polymer lamellae are oriented parallel to the substrate. These oriented crystalline structures provide anisotropic carrier transport; carrier transport occurs more efficiently in the main chain direction (ICT) than in the π–π stacking direction (heavily overlapped orbitals of π-electrons) than in the chain-to-chain packing direction (the alkyl chains surrounding the conjugated planes). As a result, the ICT and π–π stacking direction of the polymers or fullerenes—which possess higher densities of π-electrons—more strongly dictates the optimal carriers' transport direction in the active layer than the chain-to-chain packing direction. Fig. 5(a) provides a schematic representation of a p-type organic field-effect transistor device with the source and drain electrodes in the same plane as the in-plane holes transporting in the P3HT layer. The hole mobility in the P3HT layer is two orders of magnitude higher for the edge-on packing orientation (μsat = 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) than for the face-on packing orientation (μsat = 0.001 cm2 V−1 s−1), because edge-on packing allows 2-D hole transport (along the main chain and the π–π stacking directions) while face-on allows only 1-D transport (along the main chain direction). On the other hand, Fig. 5(b) displays an OPV device with the anode and cathode aligned vertically to the plane of the active layer; here, face-on packing (π–π stacking along the out-of-plane direction), rather than edge-on packing, of P3HT lamellae is more suitable for hole transport to the electrodes when achieving optimal device performance. The face-on packing of a polymer structure, relative to the plane of the device, is potentially an important feature for high-performance BHJ polymer solar cells, because the effective conjugation length induces π-overlap for carrier transport.

Cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), a rigid coplanar structure that favors intermolecular π–π interactions, exhibits good electron-donating properties and allows side-chain manipulation to influence its solubility and processability when conjugated with benzothiadiazole (BT), resulting in a low band gap polymer PCPDTBT displaying HOMO and LUMO energies of −5.3 and −3.57 eV and a value of Eg of 1.46 eV. The molecular packing of the PCPDTBT (based on CPDT and BT) polymer results in an edge-on oriented crystalline structure with a high intensity of (100) crystal planes in the qz direction. Replacing one carbon atom in PCPDTBT with a silicon atom gives another crystalline polymer, PSBTBT, but with higher energy levels (HOMO/LUMO = −5.05/−3.27 eV; Eg = 1.45 eV), achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.6% for the PSBTBT:PC71BM device.Fig. 6(a) displays the 2-D GIWAXS patterns of a PSBTBT:PC71BM blend film; the (100), (200), and (300) reflections indicate that the molecular packing of PSBTBT is in the out-of-plane direction. Fig. 6(b) presents the GIWAXS out-of-plan profiles of neat PSBTBT films before (black line) and after (gray line) thermal annealing; a strong (100) peak appears at a value of qz of 0.404 Å−1, corresponding to a chain-to-chain spacing of 15.5 Å. For the drop-cast neat PSBTBT film (blue line), a longer solvent evaporation time induced a much stronger (010) peak with a π-stacking distance of 3.5 Å. For the PSBTBT:PC71BM blend films, thermal annealing (green line) resulted in a higher intensity of the (010) peak relative to that of the as-spun blend film (red line). Based on the out-of-plane GIWAXS profiles, a higher degree of edge-on packing [Fig. 6(c)] occurred in the PSBTBT film, as evidenced by the presence of a strong (100) peak in the out-of-plane direction. When bithiopheneimide (BTI) was copolymerized as an A unit with dithienosilole (DTS) to form PBTISi-C8, (HOMO/LUMO = −5.43/−3.68 eV; Eg = 1.75 eV), a device PCE of 6.4% was achieved when PBTISi-C8 was mixed with PCBM as the active layer. Fig. 6(d) reveals that PBTISi-C8 features predominantly a face-on packing orientation, differing greatly from the dominant edge-on packing orientation found in PSBTBT and thiophene-based polymers. We suspect that the reason for PSBTBT and PBTISi-C8 adopting different packing orientations—edge-on for PSBTBT and face-on for PBTISi-C8—most likely arises from the much higher planarity and larger effective conjugation area for PBTISi-C8 than for PSBTBT, because BTI and BT units have three and two fused rings, respectively. Thus, higher effective conjugated areas (larger and more planar, toward a graphene-like structure) seem to tune the packing orientation from edge-on to face-on.

Thienopyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) is an A unit that has been used in conjugated D–A polymers; it exhibits a symmetric, rigidly fused, coplanar structure and is strongly electron-withdrawing. The D units dithienosilole (DTS) and dithienogermole (DTGe) have been used to form conjugated structures with TPD, resulting in the polymers PDTSTPD (HOMO/LUMO = −5.57/−3.88 eV; Eg = 1.73 eV) and PDTGeTPD (HOMO/LUMO = −5.6/−3.5 eV; Eg = 1.69 eV), respectively, which have provided device PCEs of greater than 7% when blended with PC71BM. When a sulfur atom of the BT unit is replaced by an oxygen atom to form benzoxadiazole (BO), the resulting conjugated polymer PCySiTBO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.02/−3.38 eV; Eg = 1.64 eV)—note that both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels decrease—forms a PCySiTBO:PC71BM device achieving a value of Voc of 0.64 V and a PCE of 5.0%. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of PCySiTBO featured a (100) peak at 4.16°, corresponding to an edge-on structure with a chain-to-chain stacking distance of 21.2 Å, and a broad feature at 21.7° corresponding to a π-stacking in the (010) plane with a distance of 4.1 Å.
In summary, 1-D conjugated D–A polymers based on CPDT, DTS, and DTGe as D units have HOMO energy levels in the range from −5.02 to −5.6 eV and LUMO energy levels in the range from −3.27 to −3.88 eV and values of Eg in the range 1.46–1.75 eV. The polymer packing is an edge-on orientation for PSBTBT and a face-on orientation for PBTISi-C8, owing to differences in their molecular planarity. Device performance has been characterized by values of Jsc of 11–16.20 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.61–0.91 V, fill factors (FFs) of 47–70%, and PCEs of 3.2–7.5%.

Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is a weak D unit featuring a symmetrical and rigid fused aromatic system that can enhance electron delocalization. When BDT is conjugated with suitable acceptors it can result in low HOMO energy levels for the resulting polymers and improved charge mobility. Liang et al. synthesized a series of PTB polymers constituting BDT in conjugation with thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT); the TT units stabilize the quinoidal structure of the backbone and, thus, narrow the band gaps of resulting polymers. The ester-functionalized TT forms new polymers that are both soluble and oxidatively stable. The conjugated polymer PTB1 (HOMO/LUMO = −4.9/−3.2 eV; Eg = 1.62 eV) has been used to prepare a BHJ PTB1:P71CBM device exhibiting a value of Voc of 0.56 V and a PCE of 5.3%. Introducing electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms into the polymer PTB1 lowered the HOMO energy level and resulted in the polymer PTB4 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.12/−3.31 eV; Eg = 1.63 eV), leading to a significant increase in the value of Voc (to 0.74 V) and PCE (to 6.1%). The side-chain modification and fluorine substitution lowered the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTTT–CF to −5.22 and −3.45 eV, respectively, resulting in a slight decrease in the value of Eg to 1.62 eV. The PBDTTT–CF:PC71BM device displayed relatively high values of Voc (0.76 V) and PCE (7.73%). Another PTB-based conjugated polymer, PTB7, had HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.15 and −3.31 eV, respectively, and a band gap of 1.71 eV. The PCE of the PTB7:PC71BM device was 7.4%, which improved to 9.2% when an additional alcohol-/water-soluble conjugated polymer was adopted to tune the work function of the ITO substrate;Fig. 7(a) and (b) display 2-D GIWAXS patterns of PTB1 and a PTB1:PC61BM blend film, receptively. The PTB1 film featured chain-to-chain stacking and a distinctive π-stacking feature at values of qx–y of 0.23 Å−1 [d(100) = 27.3 Å] and qz of 1.71 Å−1 [d(010) = 3.7 Å], respectively. Fig. 7(c) presents the out-of-plane GIWAXS profiles (insets: in-plane profiles) of neat PTB1, as-spun PTB1:PC61BM, and annealed PTB1:PC61BM films. The chain-to-chain and π-stacking peaks in these films are identical in qx–y, but with lower intensity in the blend film, suggesting a slightly lower extent of π-stacking, possibly because of intercalation of PC61BM between the polymer chains. Additional broad scattering peaks from the PTB1:PC61BM blend film appeared at values of qx–y of 1.41 Å−1 and qz of 0.73 Å−1, attributable to the random orientations of PC61BM domains.Fig. 7(d) reveals that PTB1 formed a face-on packing structure in the PTB1:PC61BM blend film. A possible explanation for the face-on packing orientation of PTB1 is that the BDT unit is a symmetrical structure with alkoxy side chains on each side—the interaction between alkoxy side chains is beneficial for the face-on packing orientation. When a sulfonyl (strong electron-withdrawing group) was introduced, the resulting polymer PBDTTT-S featured lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.12 and −3.49 eV, respectively, and a band gap of 1.65 eV. The device incorporating the PBDTTT-S:PC71BM active layer exhibited a high value of Voc (0.76 V) and the highest PCE (6.36%). In summary, 1-D conjugated D–A polymers based on BDT as the D unit and TT as the A unit have HOMO energy levels in the range from −4.9 to −5.22 eV and LUMO energy levels in the range from −3.2 to −3.51 eV and values of Eg of 1.62–1.71 eV.

For 1-D conjugated D–A polymers featuring TPD as the A unit, PBDTTPD displays low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels (from −5.4 to −5.56 eV and from −3.4 to −3.75 eV, respectively) and values of Eg of 1.73–1.82 eV. The highest PCE of a device based on PBDTTPD:PC71BM as the active layer was 6.8%. Fig. 8(a) reveals that the neat PBDTTPD–P3 film (HOMO/LUMO = −5.4/−3.67 eV; Eg = 1.73 eV) has a prominent (010) reflection in the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to π-stacking or face-on packing; side chain structures (linear or branched) on the TPD moiety could alter the chain-to-chain stacking distance and the π-stacking distance. Among PBDTTPD polymers having branched alkyl side chains on the TPD moiety, PBDTTPD–P3 with linear n-octyl side chains has a particularly strong (010) reflection in the out-of-plane direction, suggesting a face-on-oriented packing in the majority, beneficial for carrier transport in the device. Using a mixture of chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (99/1, v/v) as the processing solvent, the device performance reached a maximum PCE of 6.8% and a value of Voc of 0.85 V. By adding the solvent additive DIO to CB, the scattering pattern [Fig. 8(b)] of the PBDTTPD–P3:PC61BM blend film featured a low-intensity signal for π-stacking, possible because the PC71BM molecules intercalated into the conjugated polymer. Adding 5 vol% of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive into CB improved the PCE of the PBDTTPD(2EH/C7):PC71BM device to 8.5% from 7.3% for the device prepared without CN.Fig. 8(c) and (d) display 2-D GIWAXS patterns of the neat PBDTTPD(2EH/C7) film and the PBDTTPD(2EH/C7):PC71BM blend film, respectively; both of these films were prepared from the CB/CN (5 vol%) mixed solvent. The GIWAXS patterns of PBDTTPD(2EH/C7) are similar to the scattering patterns of PBDTTPD–P3. Introducing TT as the spacer formed the PBDT-ttTPD conjugated D–π–A polymer displaying HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.28 and −3.38 eV, respectively, and a value of Eg of 1.9 eV. The PBDT-ttTPD:PC71BM device achieved a PCE of 6.1%. The D–A conjugated polymer PBDTTPD features intramolecular non-covalent bonding between the oxygen atom of the TPD unit and sulfur atom of the BDT unit in the vicinity, greatly increasing the molecular planarity for the face-on packing orientation.
The acceptor unit BO has a low-lying oxidation potential that may increase the open-circuit voltage, but provides lower PCEs, presumably because of the low molecular weight and low solubility of its polymers. The 1-D conjugated D–A polymer PBDTBO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.34/−3.45 eV; Eg = 1.68 eV) features an alternating rigid and co-planar structure; when two n-octyloxy side chains were attached to the BO unit, the solubility of PBDTBO was enhanced, thereby resulting in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.27 and −3.16 eV, respectively, and a value of Eg of 1.74 eV. The performance of a device incorporating PBDTBO:PC61BM was characterized by a value of Voc of 0.86 V, a value of Jsc of 10.4 mA cm−2, an FF of 64.4%, and a PCE of 5.7%.
When BDT was conjugated with fluorinated BT and thiophene, the polymer PBnDT–DTffBT exhibited HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.54 and −3.33 eV, respectively, and a value of Eg of 1.7 eV. The device incorporating PBnDT–DTffBT:PC61BM as the active layer displayed a value of Voc of 0.87 V and a PCE of 7.2%. After side-chain modification of the BDT, thiophene, and BT units, the PBDTHDO–DTHBTff film displayed chain-to-chain and π-stacking distances of 19.9 and 3.6 Å, respectively, and, when mixed with PC71BM, provided devices displaying PCEs as high as 8.3%. The other BDT-based D–A conjugated polymers with 2-alkyl-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazoles (TAZ) as the A unit exhibited HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.4 and −3.1 eV, respectively, and a value of Eg of 1.91 eV; the PCEs of devices incorporating PBnDT-FTAZ:PC71BM blend films reached as high as 7.1%. Replacing the alkyl side chains of the BDT unit with alkylthiol side-chains resulted in the polymer PBDTFBZS displaying HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.32 and −3.26 eV, respectively, and a value of Eg of 1.81 eV; the PBDTFBZS:PC71BM device exhibited a high value of Voc of 0.88 V, an FF of 71.2%, and the best PCE of 7.74%. Recently, difluorothiophene has been used in conjunction with BDT to form the polymer PBDT[2F]T displaying HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.05 and −2.95 eV, respectively, and a value of Eg of 2.1 eV. Because of the enhanced electron-withdrawing ability, the PBDT[2F]T:PC71BM device reached a PCE of 7.0% with a large value of Voc (0.9 V).
In summary, 1-D conjugated D–A polymers featuring BDT as the D unit have HOMO energy levels in the range from −4.9 to −5.56 eV, LUMO energy levels in the range from −2.95 to −3.75 eV, and values of Eg of 1.62–2.1 eV. The resulting BHJ OPV devices exhibited values of Jsc of 9.1–17.46 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.56–0.97 V, FFs of 50.8–72.9%, and PCEs of 5.3–9.2%. The packing of these BDT-based conjugated polymers features a face-on orientation, resulting in the PCEs of BDT-based devices being higher than those of CPDT-based devices.

The weak D unit naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT) with four fused rings has been conjugated with a strong A unit BT to form the polymer PNDT-4DTBT (HOMO/LUMO = −5.34/−3.29 eV; Eg = 1.61 eV). The PCE of the PNDT-4DTBT:PC61BM device was 5.1%. Another four-fused-ring D unit, benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-d′′]trithiophene (BTT), has been copolymerized with BO to form the polymer PBTTBO-C13C8 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.35/−3.58 eV), reaching a PCE of 6.2% for the PBTTBO-C13C8:PC61BM device. A cyclic imide has been attached to the BT unit in the form of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylic imide, which significantly lowers HOMO and LUMO energy levels because of its strong electron-withdrawing ability. The 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-dicarboxylic imide has been copolymerized with BTT to give the conjugated polymer BBTI1 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.2/−3.7 eV; Eg = 1.5 eV), achieving a device PCE of 8.3%. The five-fused-ring donor dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DBD), in conjunction with TT, gave the polymer PTDBD2 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.24/−3.56 eV; Eg = 1.68 eV), giving a value of Voc of 0.89 V and a PCE of 7.6% for the PTDBD2:PC71BM device. 2-D GIWAXS patterns revealed that PTDBD2 had a chain-to-chain and π-stacking distances of 15.4 Å (qx–y = 0.41 Å−1) and 4.0 Å (qz = 1.55 Å−1), respectively, suggesting that PTDBD2 had a preferentially face-on orientated structure. A seven-fused-ring D unit has been synthesized by hybridizing BDT and DTS units; in conjugation with naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]oxadiazole (NO), it formed the polymer PSiNO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.5/−3.94 eV; Eg = 1.56 eV), displaying broad absorption, a low-lying HOMO energy level, and high hole mobility.PSiNO has high rigidity and planarity of its backbone, inhibiting chain folding and extending its polymer chains; its device reached a high PCE of 8.37% along with a value of Voc of 0.90 V and an FF of 70.2%. Fig. 9(a) presents a 2-D GIWAXS pattern of PSiNO featuring a (100) reflection at a value of qz of 0.38 Å−1 with a chain-to-chain stacking distance of 16.8 Å; the higher intensity of the (100) reflection in the out-of-plane direction than that in the in-plane direction indicates that the molecular stacking preferred an edge-on orientation. The chain-to-chain stacking of PSiNO was maintained when blended with PC71BM [Fig. 9(b)]. The absence of signals for π-stacking in the 2-D GIWAXS patterns revealed that the PSiNO film and the PSiNO:PC71BM blend film had low polymer crystallinity, presumably because the six flexible alkyl side chains induced disorientation. A larger nine-fused-ring ladder-type polymer (PTR9c) achieved a PCE of 5.5% for the PTR9c:PC71BM device.

In summary, the 1-D conjugated D–A polymers featuring multi-fused-ring donor units gave HOMO and LUMO energy levels in the ranges from −5.2 to −5.5 eV and from −3.29 to −3.94 eV, respectively, and values of Eg of 1.50–1.68 eV. Corresponding BHJ OPV devices gave values of Jsc of 11.2–16.45 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.67–0.9 V, FFs of 54–70.2%, and PCEs of 5.1–8.37%. The more fused rings in the D units led to higher molecular planarity and larger conjugated areas, leading to more efficient CT to n-type fullerene materials. The device incorporating the conjugated polymer presenting a nine-fused-ring donor did not display the highest PCE because the value of Voc (0.72 V) was lower than that (0.9 V) of the seven-fused-ring D unit PSiNO. The values of Eg (1.50–1.68 eV) of the multi-fused-ring conjugated polymers were lower than those (1.62–2.1 eV) of BDT-based conjugated polymers. This result is consistent with the trend that high molecular planarity can decrease the band gaps of conjugated polymers.

The low band gap polymer PTTTBO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.28/−3.06 eV; Eg = 1.72 eV) comprises mainly thiophene spacers and electron-rich thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units in conjugation with electron-withdrawing BO units. The XRD pattern of PTTTBO featured a chain-to-chain stacking distance of 19.8 Å and a π-stacking distance of 3.8 Å. The BHJ OPV device based on PTTTBO:PC61BM achieved a value of Voc of 0.85 V and a PCE of 5.3%. The TPD unit was copolymerized with two thiophene donors to give the polymer PBTTPD (HOMO/LUMO = −5.56/−3.1 eV; Eg = 1.82 eV) and with 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DTT) to give the polymer PDTTTPD (HOMO/LUMO = −5.54/−3.0 eV; Eg = 1.84 eV). The PBTTPD:PC61BM device achieved a PCE of 4.7% and a high value of Voc (0.95 V), resulting from a low-lying HOMO energy level. The PCE improved to 7.3% after replacing PC61BM with PC71BM and incorporating 1,6-diiodohexane (DIH) as the solvent additive.Fig. 10(a) displays the detailed GIWAXS out-of-plane and in-plane intensities of PBTTPD:PC71BM blend films processed with and without various additives. The strong out-of-plane (100) peak at a value of qz of 0.24 Å−1 resulted from the edge-on packing of PBTTPD; a very weak out-of-plane (010) peak appeared at a value of qz of 1.7 Å−1, resulting from face-on packing; such face-on packing would also result in an in-plane (100) peak. The introduction of additives during processing enhanced the crystallinity of both the edge-on and face-on packing structures.

A D–π–A conjugated polymer PT-ttTPD (HOMO/LUMO = −5.56/−3.9 eV; Eg = 1.75 eV), with TT units as π-spacers, provided a device with a promising PCE of 9.2% and well-ordered interchain orientation in a blend film with PC71BM.Fig. 10(b) and (c) present 2-D GIWAXS patterns of a neat PT-ttTPD film and a PT-ttTPD:PC71BM blend film, respectively; the spin-cast PT-ttTPD film provided an intense X-ray (100) reflection at a value of qz of 0.40 Å−1 and a (010) reflection at a value of qz of 1.65 Å−1, corresponding to an edge-on stacking distance of 15.7 Å and a face-on π-stacking distance of 3.81 Å. The inset schemes reveal both edge-on and face-on stacking in the neat PT-ttTPD film, and a change to face-on stacking in the PT-ttTPD:PC71BM blend film. A possible reason for this transformation is that the PC71BM molecules tuned the dihedral angle between TPD and TT to favor intramolecular noncovalent bonding between the oxygen atom of the TPD unit and the sulfur atom of the TT unit, increasing the conjugated area for the face-on packing orientation.
The diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor unit has been polymerized with three thiophene units to give the polymer PDPP3T (HOMO/LUMO = −5.17/−3.61 eV; Eg = 1.3 eV) and increase the photocurrent in the visible region, achieving a PCE of 4.7% for the PDPP3T:PC71BM device. Four thiophene units have been copolymerized with a DPP unit to form the polymer DT-PDPP4T (Eg = 1.43 eV), resulting in a PCE of 7.1% for the DT-PDPP4T:PC71BM BHJ OPV device. Changing to furan moieties in the backbone of the TPD-thiophene conjugated polymers enables the use of relatively small solubilizing side chains, because of the significant contribution of the furan rings to overall polymer solubility in common organic solvents. After blending with PC71BM, the furan-containing low band gap polymer PDPP2FT (HOMO/LUMO = −5.4/−3.8 eV; Eg = 1.41 eV) provides a device displaying a PCE of 5.0%; using the derivative polymer PDPP2FT-C14 further improved the PCE to 6.5% for the BHJ OPV device. Recently, a heterojunction device involveing a DPP-based polymer, D-PDPP4T-HD, with branched alkyl side chains on thiophene, has provided a PCE of 6.3%. The values of Eg (1.3–1.43 eV) of the conjugated polymers with DPP as the A unit were lower than those of other conjugated polymers (1.45–2.1 eV), presumably because of intramolecular noncovalent bonding between the oxygen atoms of the DPP unit and the sulfur atom of the thiophene unit.
We had reviewed the electrochemical (HOMO/LUMO) and optical band gap properties of 1-D conjugated D–A polymers incorporating various D units (CPDT, BDT, multi-fused-ring, thiophene) as well as the performances of their BHJ OPV devices. In summary, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels have been in the range from −4.9 to −5.65 eV and from −2.95 to −3.94 eV, respectively, giving values of Eg of 1.3–2.1 eV. The BHJ OPV devices have displayed values of Jsc of 8.02–17.46 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.56–0.97 V, FFs of 47–72.9%, and PCEs of 3.2–9.21%.

Incorporating electron-withdrawing moieties as A units in branched conjugated polymers that comprise repeating D units can not only improve the dissociation of the excitons but also lower the band gap to match the wavelength of the maximum photon flux of sunlight (ca. 1.77 eV).Table 2 lists BHJ OPV devices that have been prepared incorporating branched conjugated D–A polymers. Covalently attaching phenanthrenyl-imidazole moieties as side units to main-chain thiophene units has resulted in regioregular copolymers displaying low band gaps—tunable depending on the content of phenanthrenyl-imidazole moieties—and enhanced probabilities of electron transfer. Because of the poor solubility of the phenanthrenyl-imidazole moiety, 3-octylthiophene (presenting a long alkyl chain) was used as the thiophene monomer to form copolymers exhibiting improved solubility. Controlling the molar fractions (m and n) of the two monomers, the polymer P82 comprising 80% of monomers with phenanthrenyl-imidazole moieties had HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.15 and −3.75 eV and a value of Eg of 1.77 eV; the P82:PC61BM device displayed a PCE of 2.8%. Introducing two octyl chains on the phenanthrenyl-imidazole moiety improved the solubility of the polymer P91 (HOMO/LUMO = −4.65/−3.05 eV; Eg = 1.8 eV), which comprised 90% of monomers with phenanthrenyl-imidazole moieties; the resulting P91:PC61BM device achieved a PCE of 3.45%. When the molar fraction of the monomer with hexylphenanthrenyl-imidazole moieties was increased to 100%, forming PHPIT (HOMO/LUMO = −4.7/−2.9 eV; Eg = 1.85 eV), a PCE of 4.1% resulted for the PHPIT:PC61BM device. The acceptors of PFDCN,EH-PCzDCN, and PSiFDTA were located at the ends of the side chains and were connected to the triphenylamine donors on the main chain through a styrylthiophene π-bridge. These three polymers had HOMO and LUMO energy levels in the ranges from −5.23 to −5.35 eV and from −3.4 to −3.61 eV, respectively, and values of Eg of 1.74–1.83 eV. Another novel branched D–A conjugated copolymer, PBDT-TDPP-S, featured a backbone formed of BDT units conjugated with thiophene moieties and had thiophene-DPP units appended onto the thienyl units to build the side chain through the linkage of a 2-vinylthiophenyl unit. Devices based on these branched conjugated D–A polymers achieved PCEs of 3–5%. In summary, the branched conjugated D–A polymers had HOMO and LUMO energy levels in the ranges from −4.65 to −5.35 eV and from −2.9 to −3.75 eV, respectively, and values of Eg of 1.73–1.85 eV. Their BHJ OPV devices provided values of Jsc of 6.22–14.20 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.61–0.99 V, FFs of 31.1–60%, and PCEs of 2.8–4.89%. Thus, devices based on branched D–A conjugated polymers that do not undergo good molecular packing display poorer performances (in terms of short-circuit current density, FF, and, thus, PCE) relative to devices based on 1-D conjugated D–A polymers. Accordingly, 2-D conjugated D–A polymers have been developed to improve the device performance.

In this section we review the 2-D conjugated D–A polymers that have been used in fullerene-based BHJ OPVs (Table 3). The 2-D conjugated structure has a distinct feature of conjugated side chains on the D building blocks to further extend the area of conjugation and, thus, enhance the intermolecular π–π interactions of the conjugated surfaces of the polymers. The development of 2-D conjugated D–A polymers has been based primarily on the use of BDT as the D unit. The 1-D conjugated D–A polymers without conjugated side chains on the BDT units feature π-electron delocalization only on their conjugated backbones. When alkylthienyl groups were introduced as side chains of the BDT units, the π-electrons also delocalized over the conjugated side chains; therefore, the 2-D conjugated D–A polymers possessed higher coplanarity and larger conjugated areas, ensuring more effective π-overlap and, thus, facilitating exciton diffusion and CT.

Thienyl-substituted BDT was copolymerized with TT to form the polymer PBDTTT-C-T (HOMO/LUMO = −5.11/−3.25 eV; Eg = 1.58 eV); the PBDTTT-C-T:PC61BM device achieved a PCE of 7.6%. Replacing the alkyl–thienyl side chains on the BDT units with alkylthio-thienyl side-chains, along with a fluorinated TT unit, improved the resulting device's PCE to 9%. Thiophene units were introduced on the BDT side position and between the BDT and TT units to enlarge the area of π-overlap both parallel and normal to the chain axis and also to minimize the effects of the steric bulk of the side chains. Compared with the 1-D polymer PBDTTT-S (HOMO/LUMO = −5.10/−3.51 eV; Eg = 1.65 eV), the 2-D conjugated polymer PBDTDTTT-S-T provided higher device performance, with a value of Voc of 0.69 V and a PCE of 7.8%. Fig. 11(a) presents out-of-plane GIWAXS profiles of spin-cast PBDTTT-S and PBDTDTTT-S-T films (HOMO/LUMO = −5.04/−3.57 eV; Eg = 1.59 eV). The film of PBDTDTTT-S-T exhibited a pronounced (100) reflection at 0.26 Å−1 [d(010) = 24.2 Å], in contrast to a quite weak broad peak at 0.29 Å−1 [d(100) = 21.6 Å] for PBDTTT-S. A weak (010) reflection was also observed at 1.79 Å−1 [d(010) = 3.51 Å], corresponding to packing through (010) π-stacking. Fig. 11(b) reveals that the profile of the PBDTTT-S:PC71BM blend film (processed with DIO) was almost identical to that of the neat PBDTTT-S film, suggesting an amorphous state for this polymer. For the PBDTDTTT-S-T:PC71BM blend film, the structural ordering of the polymer was recovered, similar to that observed for its neat polymer film. Based on the GIWAXS profiles, the 1-D conjugated D–A polymer PBDTTT-S had quite low crystallinity, while that of the 2-D conjugated D–A polymer PBDTDTTT-S-T was higher. Introducing the thiophene side chains onto the BDT units made the polymer chains quite crowded, hampering side-chain interdigitation and organization, and thereby, decreasing the overall order of the polymer chains. This effect could be mitigated after introducing thiophene rings as spacers in the main chain. We have observed that enlarging the π-conjugated area parallel and normal to the backbone can effectively induce the face-on packing orientation, as revealed by the peak intensities in GIWAXS profiles. Comparing the BHJ film with the neat polymer film, the intensity of the (010) peak of PBDTDTTT-S-T decreased in the presence of PC71BM, due to the small molecules intercalating in the polymer and hindering its π-stacking in the out-of-plane direction.

Replacing the alkythienyl side chains on the BDT units with m-alkoxyphenyl side chains, giving PBT-OP, decreased the HOMO energy level from −4.95 to −5.17 eV and gave a LUMO of −3.14 eV. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage of the device improved significantly (from 0.60 to 0.78 V), while the PCE increased from 5.5 to 7.50%. Introducing TT units onto the BDT building blocks (D units) provided the polymer PTTBDT-FTT (HOMO/LUMO = −5.31/−3.76 eV; Eg = 1.55 eV) displaying improved π-overlap between conjugated polymer chains and greater molecular ordering and hole mobility. The PCEs of conventional and inverted PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM devices were 7.4 and 7.7%, respectively. Fig. 11(c) and (d) present 2-D GIWAXS patterns of the neat PTTBDT-FTT film and the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM blend film, respectively. The neat PTTBDT-FTT film provided diffraction peaks at qz (0.26 Å−1) and qx–y that corresponded to a value of d(100) of 24.6 Å. Very strong (010) π-stacking was observed at a value of qz of 1.70 Å−1, corresponding to a value of d(010) of 4.0 Å. Thus, the neat PTTBDT-FTT film featured predominantly a face-on packing orientation. The pattern of the PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM blend film lacked the signal of the (010) reflection but featured enhanced (200) and (300) reflections, indicating that the polymer stacks in the film had high structural organization but lacked π-stacking in the presence of PC71BM.
In summary, both PBDTDTTT-S-T and PTTBDT-FTT featured face-on packing orientations of their crystalline polymers in neat films as a result of their conjugated side chains having large areas of conjugation. The 2-D conjugated D–A polymers based on BDT and TT as D and A units, respectively, resulted in values of Jsc of 13.4–18.0 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.69–0.89 V, FFs of 58.7–71.8%, and PCEs of 7.44–9.97%—all higher than those (13.00–17.46 mA cm−2, 0.56–0.76 V, 58–70%, and 5.3–9.2%, respectively) of 1-D conjugated polymers based on the same D and A units.

The copolymerization of alkylthienyl-substituted BDT (a weak electron-donating unit) with BT units has produced 2-D conjugated D–A polymers having large areas of π-conjugation and good planarity, such as PBDTTBT (HOMO/LUMO = −5.31/−3.44 eV; Eg = 1.75 eV) and BDT-FBT-2T (HOMO/LUMO = −5.33/−3.63 eV; Eg = 1.72 eV). Replacing the alkyl-thienyl units on BDT with alkyl-phenyl side chains gave the polymer PBDTP-DTBT (HOMO/LUMO = −5.35/−3.34 eV; Eg = 1.7 eV); the resulting PBDTP-DTBT:PC71BM device exhibited a PCE of 8.0% with a value of Voc of 0.88 V. Using fluorinated BT as a strong A unit, alkyl-thiothienyl-substituted BDT (BDTTS) as a D unit, and TT as a π-bridge resulted in the π-extended 2-D conjugated D–A polymer PBDTTS-TTffBT (HOMO/LUMO = −5.45/−3.69 eV; Eg = 1.59 eV), which provided broader light absorption, strong interchain interactions, and efficient CT. Fig. 12 reveals that the PBDTTS-TTffBT:PC71BM blend film exhibited an intense (100) reflection at a value of qx–y of 0.39 Å−1 and a (010) reflection at a value of qz of 1.61 Å−1 that is very close to the reflection contributed by PC71BM. This GIWAXS pattern suggested a predominant face-on crystallite orientation in the PBDTTS-TTffBT:PC71BM blend film. The 2-D conjugated D–A polymers based on BDT and BT as D and A units, respectively, resulted in values of Jsc of 10.70–15.43 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.80–0.92 V, FFs of 57.5–72.0%, and PCEs of 5.66–9.44%.


As a 2-D conjugated D–A polymer with TPD as the A units, the alkylthienyl-substituted polymer PBDT(T)TPD exhibited a faint scattering intensity in the out-of-plane direction, suggesting a modest preferential face-on orientation relative to the substrate. The conjugated D–π–A polymer featured TT as the π-bridge between the alkylthienyl-substituted BDT and TPD to increase the absorption coefficient. Kim et al. employed 2-D GIWAXS to investigate the packing orientation in 1-D and 2-D conjugated D–A polymer films. Fig. 13(a) and (b) present 2-D GIWAXS patterns of PBDT-ttTPD (1-D) and PBDTT-ttTPD (2-D) films, respectively; Fig. 13(c) and (d) display corresponding patterns of their BHJ blend films. The patterns of both films feature pronounced (100) reflections in the in-plane direction (qxy = 0.3 Å−1) and (010) reflections (qz = 1.68 Å−1). In comparison, the film of PBDTT-ttTPD (HOMO/LUMO = −5.30/−3.44 eV; Eg = 1.86 eV), with alkylthienyl conjugated side chains for π-electron delocalization, featured a higher-intensity (010) reflection than that of PBDT-ttTPD, suggesting a highly face-on packing orientation in the film of the 2-D conjugated D–A polymer. Both polymer:PC71BM blend films display enhanced (100) reflections and reduced (010) reflections, suggesting that fewer face-on lamellae formed in the presence of PC71BM. The 2-D conjugated D–A polymers based on BDT and TPD as D and A units, respectively, resulted in values of Jsc of 9.79–13.70 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.84–1.00 V, FFs of 58–73%, and PCEs of 6.2–7.71%.


For the 2-D conjugated D–π–A polymer with BO as the A unit, fluorine atoms were incorporated on the alkoxyphenyl side chains to give the polymer PBO-m-FPO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.53/−3.87 eV; Eg = 1.66 eV); the resulting PBO-m-FPO:PC71BM device, prepared using zirconium acetylacetonate as the electron transport layer, provided a PCE of 8.0%. Fig. 14(a)–(c) present the scattering patterns of neat PBO-m-FPO, the PBO-m-FPO:PC71BM blend film, and the PBO-m-FPO:PC71BM blend film processed with DIO, respectively. The film of pure PBO-m-FPO provided an intense π-stacking (010) reflection at a value of qz of 1.70 Å−1 [d(010) = 3.69 Å], suggesting a majority face-on packing orientation. After blending with PC71BM, all the (010) reflections in the blend (prepared with or without DIO) disappeared, suggesting that the π-packing had been disrupted. Moreover, the chain-to-chain (100) reflection of the PBO-m-FPO film was weak, but became more pronounced in the in-plane direction after blending with PC71BM. Further treatment with the DIO additive induced an even stronger (100) reflection for the PBO-m-FPO:PC71BM blend film. Jiang et al. synthesized PBDTSTBO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.46/−3.68 eV; Eg = 1.78 eV) with selenophene units as side chains on the BDT moieties; the corresponding device exhibited a PCE of 7.6% with a high value of Voc (0.86 V). A Se atom is much larger and less electronegative than an S atom; thus, Se-containing polymers are generally more effective at extending the absorption spectrum toward the infrared region. The 2-D GIWAXS pattern of PBDTSTBO features a strong (010) reflection along the out-of-plane direction [d(010) = 3.63 Å] and a (100) reflection for chain-to-chain stacking along the in-plane direction, indicating that these lamellae had a face-on orientation. After replacing the branched alkyl side chains of the thiophene-substituted BDT building block with linear alkyl groups, Fig. 14(e) and (f) reveal that PBDTSTBO and PBDTT-C-BO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.42/−3.65 eV; Eg = 1.77 eV) have strong (010) π-stacking along the out-of-plane direction and (100) interchain stacking along the in-plane direction, indicative of face-on orientations in their structures. The 2-D conjugated D–A random copolymer PBDTT-BO-DPP based on BDT as D units and both BO and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.32 and −3.54 eV, respectively, and a value of Eg of 1.78 eV. The optimized PBDTT-BO-DPP:PC71BM OPV device exhibited a value of Jsc of 17 mA cm−2, a value of Voc of 0.73 V, an FF of 55%, and a PCE of 6.8%.


The conjugated polymer PBDTBDD (HOMO/LUMO = −5.23/−3.18 eV) based on the A unit benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) featured an optical band gap of 2.05 eV and a HOMO energy level of −5.23 eV. When substituted with fluorine atoms, the resulting polymer PM6 exhibited a narrower optical band gap (1.80 eV) and a lower HOMO energy level (−5.45 eV), with the PM6:PC71BM inverted device revealing a high value of Voc (0.98 V) and a PCE of 9.2%.Fig. 15 displays the in-plane and out-of-plane GIWAXS profiles of the neat PM6 film and PM6:PC71BM blend films prepared with different concentrations of DIO as a solvent additive. The GIWAXS out-of-plane profile of the neat polymer film features a pronounced (100) peak at 0.31 Å−1 [d(100) = 20.3 Å], whereas the in-plane profile also exhibits strong (100) and weak (200) peaks at 0.31 and 0.62 Å−1, respectively. In addition, the out-of-plane profile reveals a (010) π-stacking peak at 1.66 Å−1 [d(010) = 3.78 Å], indicating that a majority of the polymer molecules had a face-on packing orientation. When blended with PC71BM, the intensity of the in-plane (100) peak decreased and the (010) peak was completely absent. In the presence of DIO, the intensities of the (100) peak and the π-stacking (010) peak increased significantly; upon increasing the amount of DIO, the intensity of the (100) peak continued to increase, but the (010) peak remained almost unchanged. Recently, alkylthio-thienyl-substituted BDT was copolymerized with BDD to form the polymer PDST-BDD featuring a relatively low HOMO energy level (−5.52 eV) and a value of Eg of 1.83 eV. Compared with a PCE of 6.67% for the PBDTBDD:PC71BM device, this PDST-BDD:PC71BM device displayed a significant increase in the value of Voc (from 0.86 to 1.0 V) but decreases in the value of Jsc and the FF, resulting in a lower PCE (5.95%). In addition to alkyl-thienyl and alkylthio-thienyl-substituted BDT side chains, Huang et al. also copolymerized 4-methoxy modified thiophene substituted BDT with the acceptor unit (BDD) to form PMOT5 that exhibits a Voc of 0.96 V and a PCE up to 9.3% based on the PMOT5:PC71BM device.

Huo et al. synthesized the conjugated polymer PBDF-T1 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.43/−3.54 eV; Eg = 1.83 eV) using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']difuran (BDF), which has a similar molecular structure to BDT in the backbone, as a building block D unit. The PBDF-T1:PC71BM device displayed a PCE of 9.4% and a value of Voc of 0.92 V—higher than those (8.1% and 0.86 V, respectively) of the PBDT-T1:PC71BM device. As neat films, the polymers PBDF-T1 and PBDT-T1 (HOMO/LUMO = −5.32/−3.52 eV; Eg = 1.81 eV) both adopted preferential face-on orientations (strong π-stacking signals in the out-of-plane direction) and very weak chain-to-chain packing. When mixed with PC71BM, the intensity of the scattering peak representing the π-stacking of PBDF-T1 decreased, revealing that PC71BM severely altered its molecular packing.
Recently, DPP units were also used to copolymerize with 2-D structured BDT donor units to form PDPP-CH or with BDD to form P266, and can result in PCE of 8.1% and 9.2% for the PDPP-CH:PC71BM and P266:PC71BM devices, respectively. A new D–A polymer PThBDTP comprising thiophene and [7,7′-bidithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridine]-5,5′(4H,4′H)-dione (BDTP) has increased the PCE up to 10.2% based on the PThBDTP:PC71BM device with a single junction structure. In addition to DPP units, BDT-based small molecules blended in PTB7-TH:PC71BM forming the ternary active layer can also improve the PCE to 10.4%.

In summary, BDT-TT conjugated polymers having 1-D structures displayed HOMO and LUMO energy levels ranging from −4.9 to −5.22 eV and from −3.2 to −3.51 eV, respectively, with values of Eg of 1.62–1.73 eV. For BDT-TT conjugated polymers having 2-D structures, the ranges of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were from −5.04 to −5.44 eV and from −3.14 to −3.76 eV, with values of Eg of 1.51–1.7 eV. BDT-TPD conjugated polymers having 1-D structures exhibited HOMO and LUMO energy levels ranging from −5.28 to −5.56 eV and from −3.38 to −3.75 eV, with values of Eg of 1.73–1.9 eV. In 2-D structures, the ranges of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for the BDT-TPD conjugated polymers were from −5.30 to −5.61 eV and from −3.44 to −3.56 eV, with values of Eg of 1.85 eV. The dihedral angles between the furyl, thienyl, and selenophenyl conjugated side groups and the BDT units in the BDT-TT conjugated polymers having 2-D structures were 34.1, 59.4, and 61.1°, respectively; for BDT-TPD conjugated polymers, these dihedral angles were 33.9, 56, and 56.8°, respectively. The conjugated polymers having selenophenyl moieties on their side chains had the largest dihedral angles because selenium atoms are larger than oxygen and sulfur atoms. The dihedral angles in the conjugated polymers of BDT–π–BO having furyl, thienyl, and phenyl moieties as side-chain groups were 33.9, 56.8, and 58.3°, respectively, and 70.1–82.6° for the m-fluoro-p-alkoxyphenyl moiety. Thus, it appears that a six-membered ring could twist with a larger dihedral angle than that of a five-membered ring.

In order to discern the effect of the differences between 1-D and 2-D polymer architectures on the photovoltaic devices' performances, we prepare a figure for the PCEs of the devices of 1-D and 2-D conjugated structures that incorporate the same D and A units in their main chains. Fig. 16 displays the PCEs of BHJ OPV devices featuring 1-D and 2-D conjugated D–A polymers having the same D and A units in their main chains (selected from Tables 1 and 3), namely the polymers BDT-TT, BDT-TPD, BDT-BO, and BDT-BT. Devices incorporating BDT-TT conjugated polymers having 1-D structures provided values of Jsc of 13–17.46 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.56–0.76 V, FFs of 58–70%, and PCEs of 5.3–9.2%. For devices based on BDT-TT polymers having 2-D structures, the values of Jsc were 13.4–18.0 mA cm−2, values of Voc were 0.69–0.89 V, FFs were 58.7–71.8%, and PCEs were 7.4–10%. The devices featuring BDT-TPD polymers having 1-D structures gave values of Jsc of 9.1–12.6 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.82–0.97 V, FFs of 53.8–72%, and PCEs of 4.2–8.5%. For BDT-TPD polymers having 2-D structures, the devices had values of Jsc of 9.79–13.70 mA cm−2, values of Voc of 0.84–1.00 V, FFs of 58.0–73.0%, and PCEs of 6.2–7.7%. Except for OPV devices based on BDT-TPD, the PCEs of the best devices based on the 2-D structures obtaining from different research groups were higher than those of the devices based on 1-D structures. The average PCEs of the devices incorporating the 2-D polymers were always higher than those of the devices incorporating the 1-D polymers, indicative of greater stability. Such enhancements presumably arose from the 2-D conjugated polymers having greater areas of conjugation of the D units (broadening the range of visible light absorption) as well as complete face-on packing, resulting in better charge carrier transport to the respective electrodes. In the future, it is quite possible that additional reaction functional groups can be attached to these 2-D conjugated D–A polymers to provide crosslinking, resulting in longer life time of the organic photovoltaic devices that incorporate these conjugated polymers.

The band gaps and molecular packing orientations of 1-D, branched and 2-D conjugated D–A polymers are determined primarily by the effective conjugation areas of the polymer structures. The band gaps of D–A conjugated polymers having 2-D structures are slightly lower than those of 1-D structures having similar chemical units, but the molecular packing can differ significantly in terms of either the packing orientation or the intensity of packing, both of which influence the photocurrent and, thus, the PCE of the device. For example, for 1-D D–A conjugated polymers, the edge-on orientation is favored when the side chains are on the same side of the CPDT (D) unit, but the face-on orientation is preferred when the CPDT donor is copolymerized with an A unit having greater molecular co-planarity and a larger effective conjugated area (e.g., BTI). For conjugated polymers with BDT as D units, two side chains located symmetrically on each side of the D unit result in preferential face-on-oriented packing. Further evolution from branched to 2-D structures led to BDT-based conjugated polymers having extended conjugated side chains that increased the effective conjugated areas and resulted in symmetrical molecular structures for preferred face-on packing. Compared with BHJ OPV devices based on 1-D and branched conjugated D–A polymers, devices incorporating 2-D conjugated D–A polymers had higher short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltages, resulting in larger PCEs as a result of better charge carrier transport to the respective electrodes. Except for OPV devices based on BDT-TPD, the PCEs of the best devices based on the 2-D structures were higher than those of the devices based on 1-D structures. The average PCEs of the devices incorporating the 2-D D–A polymers were always higher than those of the devices incorporating the 1-D D–A polymers, indicative of greater stability. In future studies, 2-D conjugated D–A polymers should be prepared not only to ensure face-on packing but also to have additional functional groups that can be involved in crosslinking reactions to enhance the stability of their OPV devices. Hence, 2-D conjugated D–A polymers will remain in the mainstream of molecule design for improving the performance of BHJ OPV devices.
