Slot-die coating being compatible with the roll-to-roll technique has been regarded as a promising tool for upscaling the manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, there has been a significant gap between the efficiencies of the state-of-the-art spin-coated devices and the scalable processed devices. The active layer morphology is crucial to achieve high efficiency in OSCs, which depends on the conditions of film fabrication. To figure out and optimize the slot-die coating process, a deeper understanding of the film formation kinetics is important. Herein, in situ measurements of the slot-die coating process based on the PM7:IT4F system are demonstrated to illustrate the aggregation and crystallization evolution at various die temperatures and substrate temperatures. OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency of 13.2% are achieved at 60 °C die temperature/60 °C substrate temperature due to the improved exciton dissociation, charge transport and suppressed non-radiative charge recombination. The optimized morphology is attributed to the balanced polymer pre-aggregation and small molecule crystallization kinetics. The unsuitable die temperature leads to overlarge phase separation and consequently inefficient exciton dissociation while the improper substrate temperature results in weak crystallization and the following shrunken carrier lifetime with strong non-radiative combination. This work provides fundamental understanding on the correlations among processing methodology, solution pre-aggregation, morphology formation kinetics, device physics and device performance and affords guidance for device optimization in scalable manufacturing.

Over the past years, great progresses have been made to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) to be over 17% in single-junction devices. However, the PCE of the scalable processed devices still lags behind of the state-of-the-art in lab-scale spin-coated devices which limits the commercial application of OSCs. Slot-die coating exhibits great compatibility with roll-to-roll setting and has been considered to be the potential tool to realize the large area manufacturing. Morphology optimization is crucial to the device performance but the morphology evolution of slot-die coating is complicated due to the manifold processing parameters, thus it's hard to acquire the optimized morphology. In this report, we implement detailed ex situ and in situ morphology measurements to illustrate the aggregation and crystallization kinetics under different temperatures in slot-die coating process and revealed the effects of temperature on the morphology evolution and photo physics process. Our results provided fundamental understandings on the correlations among processing methodologies, solution pre-aggregation, morphology formation kinetics, device physics and photovoltaic performance and afford guidance for the device optimization in large area manufacturing of OSCs.


Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a prospective approach for energy harvesting due to their superior merits of light weight, flexibility and up-scalable processibility. Recently, with the intensive efforts on novel materials synthesis, interfacial engineering and morphology optimization, the state-of-the-art OSCs have achieved record power conversion efficiency (PCE) values over 17%. However, these breakthroughs are mostly made in lab-scale spin coating devices. To be commercially available, OSCs should be able to be manufactured by scale-up methods. Among the investigated printing techniques in the field of OSCs, slot-die coating as a feasible process exhibits glorious compatibility with the large-area roll-to-roll setting. As a pre-metered method, slot-die coating shows superiority in technique control and stripe pattern processing compared with the spin coating methodology. Therefore, this method has been regarded as a promising tool for large scale production of OSCs and has been used widely in the OSC community. However, highly efficient OSCs over 10% processed by slot-die coating are rarely reported due to the challenges in the absence of a fundamental understanding of the active layer morphology control of this special coating method. Even though a highest efficiency of 13.5% has been achieved presently in ternary systems, champion devices still lag behind the development of the field. To solve the critical problems of PCE improvement and future applications, the relationships among film formation kinetics, active layer morphology and photo physics need to be thoroughly investigated to understand the mechanism of photovoltaic performance enhancement.

Compared to spin coated films, the morphology of slot-die coating devices is more difficult to modulate because of the complex processing parameters such as striping speed, inking speed, processing temperature, etc. Substantial research studies on the relationship between processing parameters and photovoltaic performance have been investigated to obtain high PCE values. For example, Min et al. reported the effects of coating speed and flowing rates on the device performance and demonstrated highly efficient OSCs with 12.9% in a binary OSC system. Doojin Vak et al. optimized the device using temperature-controlled slot-die deposition and found that a hot substrate and hot solution resulted in improved crystallization and phase separation. However, lacking the fundamental knowledge of film formation kinetics, device optimization is still a process of trial and error so far. In addition, the thermodynamic state of the solution, pre-aggregation for instance, also exerts non-negligible effects on the final active layer morphology. Amassian's group observed seeded fibrils in the P3HT pre-aggregated solution and therefore the pre-aggregation of P3HT solutions promoted the charge transport due to the formation of the interconnected network of crystalline fibrils. The thermodynamic state can be adjusted conveniently as the advantages of slot die coating such as altering the solution temperature. Therefore, more efforts should be proposed to guide how to regulate the slot-die coating thermodynamics and kinetics. For this purpose, in situ characterizations are required to illustrate the structure evolution and clarify how the ideal morphology is formed and influenced under diverse processing conditions. Pröller et al. explored the formation of polymer:fullerene active layers during a slot-die coating process using in situ grazing incidence wide angle and small angle X-ray scattering and revealed a unique five-stage growth and assembly process with two observed crystal growth rates, indicating the characteristic dynamics of slot-die coating. Nevertheless, more profound investigations on the film formation kinetics of polymer:small molecule systems are demanded to help to transform the highly-efficient lab-scale spin coating devices into an up-scale fabrication.
Detailed active layer morphology and photovoltaic performance relationship have been established in case of spin-coating systems in the past few years. Recently, prominent efforts have been made on revealing the relationship of the morphology and device physics including charge generation and recombination. Impressive photovoltaic parameters have been realized by controlling the interfacial and bulk morphology. Recombination losses originating from interfacial transfer limit the short-current density while those from bulk transport of charges limit the fill factor, which also contributes to the open-circuit voltage losses. Durrant and coworkers demonstrated that smaller geminate recombination can be achieved with enhanced crystallization length due to the enlarged diffusion length of excitons. Hou et al. reported the suppressed non-radiative recombination in PM6:Y6:PCBM ternary systems due to the increscent transport channels and decreased phase separation with the addition of PCBM. However, photo physics investigations in slot-die coated devices are still rarely reported which is unfavorable to understand the mechanism of device improvement. The rather poor performance in slot-die coated devices is attributed to the imbalanced crystalline donor/acceptor phases in the bulk heterojunction inhibiting exciton diffusion and free charge transport. Thus, intensive crystallization control in the slot-die coating process needs to be further explored. Understanding the correlations among processing methodology, pre-aggregation, morphology formation kinetics, device physics and device performance will provide general guidance on the effective optimization of slot-die coated devices.
In this work, we fabricate slot-die coated OSCs with a wide bandgap polymer donor (PM7) and a non-fullerene acceptor (IT4F). A series of die temperatures (DTs) and substrate temperatures (STs) are controlled to modulate the thermodynamics and film formation kinetics. Therefore, highly efficient OSCs with a PCE of 13.2% are achieved which is the highest reported efficiency in binary slot-die coating systems. Ex situ and in situ characterizations of the morphology are presented to investigate the effects of the processing temperature on the active layer structure and the corresponding device performance. Detailed measurements on the charge recombination/transport behaviors are executed to reveal the mechanism of device performance improvement caused by the morphology. The best photovoltaic properties are acquired at 60 °C DT/60 °C ST because of the balanced donor and acceptor pre-aggregation and crystallization kinetics, which induces improved charge generation and transport, and suppressed non-radiative charge recombination losses. Our study on the relationship between morphology evolution and device photophysics caused by processing temperature will provide effective guidance on the prospective up-scale manufacturing.

The chemical structures of polymer donor PM7 and small molecule acceptor IT4F are shown in Fig. 1a. The OSCs are fabricated with an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al. To figure out the effects of processing temperature, various DTs (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 °C) and STs (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 °C) are used to fabricate the slot-die coated devices (25 processing conditions, summarized in Table 1 and Table S1, ESI). Fig. 1b and c show the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) distributions under disparate processing temperature combinations. Enormous difference can be observed from the contour maps. Concluded from Fig. 1b, a larger Jsc value can be achieved by using high DT or high ST. Interestingly, both high DT/ST and low DT/ST combinations are not beneficial to the Jsc values. The larger Jsc value under high DT partly results from the relative thicker film (130 versus 110 nm). On the other hand, FF value exhibits completely different trends where high FF can be realized when ST is higher than DT. Distinguished from Jsc and FF, delicate difference (0.02 V) can be observed from the open circuit voltage (Voc) values at different temperatures as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). Due to the differential Jsc and FF values, device performance shows great distinction and the best performance is achieved at 60 °C DT/60 °C ST with the record power conversion efficiency of 13.2%.

To illustrate the tremendous performance diversity caused by DT and ST, devices processed with diverse DTs and STs (20/60 °C, 60/60 °C, 100/60 °C, 60/20 °C and 60/100 °C, the former one is the die temperature and the later one is the substrate temperature) are investigated systematically. The J–V curves are depicted in Fig. 1d and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The 60/60 °C devices show the best performance among all the devices and exhibit an average PCE of 12.7% with the highest PCE of 13.2%, which is the highest efficiency of slot-die coating binary devices to date. The average Voc, Jsc and FF values are 0.87 V, 21.3 mA cm−2 and 68.5%, respectively. When increasing the DT from 20 to 100 °C and keeping the ST at 60 °C, the Jsc value increases first (from 19.1 to 21.3 mA cm−2) and then decreases slightly (from 21.3 to 20.8 mA cm−2) while the FF value displays a decreasing trend (from 69.2% to 68.5% and 57.0%). Thus, the 20/60 °C and 100/60 °C devices show relatively lower PCEs compared to the 60/60 °C devices. When boosting the ST, all four parameters increase first then decrease again, where the 60/20 °C device shows an average PCE of 10.0% with the Voc of 0.86 V, Jsc of 20.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 57.3%. The 60/100 °C device shows an average PCE of 10.7% with the Voc of 0.85 V, Jsc of 20.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.3%. Large-area devices of 0.95 cm2 are also fabricated and the highest PCE of 11.6% is achieved with the Voc of 0.85 V, Jsc of 20.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.8% at 60/60 °C as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 1e. The 60/60 °C device shows an overall higher EQE value than those of devices processed at other temperature conditions while the 20/60 °C device shows lower EQE value at the full spectrum range, consistent with the lower Jsc value.
To account for the better photovoltaic performance of 60/60 °C devices, the dependences of Voc and Jsc on the light intensity are investigated. The semi-logarithmic plot of Voc as a function of light intensity exhibits the linear relationship with a slope of kT/q. A stronger dependence of Voc on light intensity with a slope larger than kT/q will be observed if Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is involved. As depicted in Fig. 1f, the small slope of 1.58kT/q suggests a low SRH recombination for the 60/60 °C devices. Quantitatively, the light intensity dependent Jsc is employed to detect the bimolecular recombination under a short circuit condition. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI), the fitted slopes (α) are 0.89, 0.90, 0.85, 0.86 and 0.87 for the devices processed at 20/60 °C, 60/60 °C, 100/60 °C, 60/20 °C and 60/100 °C, respectively. The largest α value of 60/60 °C devices indicates the lowest bimolecular recombination losses among those conditions. The charge carrier mobilities are investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. As shown in Fig. S4, ESI and Table 1, when increasing the DT, the hole mobilities decrease while the electron mobilities increase (9.10 × 10−4, 7.71 × 10−4 and 5.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole mobilities and 1.42 × 10−4, 3.81 × 10−4 and 4.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron mobilities). However, both hole mobilities and electron mobilities enlarge first and decrease later (shown as a reversed “V” shape) when increasing the ST (1.74 × 10−4, 7.71 × 10−4 and 2.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole mobilities and 2.66 × 10−4, 3.81 × 10−4 and 3.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron mobilities). Notably, the 60/60 °C devices exhibit high and relatively balanced carrier mobilities which are beneficial to improve charge transport, and the photovoltaic performance. Consequently, the excellent photovoltaic properties of the 60/60 °C devices can be attributed to the suppressed charge recombination and ameliorative charge transport.
Further investigations on charge generation, transport and recombination are carried out to understand the performance discrepancy resulting from the varied processing temperatures. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the corresponding films (shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S5, ESI) is measured to clarify the exciton dissociation behavior. According to the absorption spectra of the pure films (Fig. S6, ESI), there is an absorption band in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm for IT4F with the peak at 740 nm, and thus the excitation wavelength of 730 nm is used to excite IT4F principally. The PL emission is in the range of 740–850 nm with a peak at 804 nm. For the films processed at 60 °C DT, excitons are efficiently quenched by the PM7 in the blends. The 60/20 °C and 60/100 °C devices show a dominant quenching rate close to unity (97.9% and 96.9%, respectively), which likely is due to the morphology. However, when increasing the DT from 20 to 100 °C, the quenching rate gets reduced distinctly (91.5%, 92.5% and 87.6%, respectively). These results indicate that the exciton dissociation and charger transfer between IT4F and PM7 are less efficient at high DT. Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements are conducted to investigate the charge carrier lifetimes (τ). As shown in the Fig. 2b, for the devices processed at elevated DT, the charge carrier lifetime gets enhanced, while for the devices processed with different ST, a maximum carrier lifetime is obtained at 60 °C. As a result, the poor Jsc values of the 20/60 and 100/60 °C devices are caused by the inefficient exciton dissociation, while the poor FF values of the 60/20 and 60/100 °C devices result from the short carrier lifetime. The relatively higher quenching rate and longer carrier lifetime are responsible for the better performance of the 60/60 °C devices.
The detailed energy losses are subsequently investigated to verify the influence on recombination of charge carriers caused by the fabrication methodology. According to the literature, the total energy loss (ΔE) can be attributed to three parts (noted in the ESI for details) using the following equations:
ΔE = Eg − qVOC = (Eg − qVSQOC) − (qVSQOC − qVradOC) − (qVradOC − qVOC) = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3
where
q is the elementary charge and VSQOC is the maximum voltage by the Shockley–Queisser limit.VradOC is the open-circuit voltage when there is only radiative recombination. ΔE1 is the radiative recombination loss originating from the absorption above the bandgap, ΔE2 is the additional radiative recombination loss below the bandgap and ΔE3 is the non-radiative recombination loss. The bandgap (Eg) of the corresponding devices is estimated by the intersection of the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum and sensitive-EQE spectrum. Extracted from the plots shown in Fig. S7 (ESI), the Egs are summarized in Table 2. The results show that all the blends have bandgap energy around 1.57 eV, mainly because of the low bandgap IT4F in the blend. As the DT increases, the Eg gets smaller while the Eg shows a “V” shape trend as the ST increases, which may result from the different crystalline properties caused by the processing conditions. As shown in Table 2, all the devices exhibit similar values of ΔE1 of about 0.285 eV, which is coincident with the reported value of IT4F-based systems. For devices processed at various DT, the radiative recombination losses below the gap are almost the same while a reversed “V” shape trend can be seen for the devices processed at elevated ST. The third part of energy loss, ΔE3, can be evaluated by measuring the EQEel. As shown in Fig. 2c, the 60/60 °C device shows the highest EQEel value, which gives the smallest non-radiative recombination energy losses. Devices processed at unsuitable ST and high DT (60/20 °C, 60/100 °C and 100/60 °C) show smaller EQEel values, indicating more severe non-radiative recombination losses, which explains the FF disparity of the devices. The three parts of the energy losses of different devices are demonstrated in Fig. 2d. The 60/60 °C devices exhibit the smallest ΔE3 and consequent smallest energy losses, contributing to the superior photovoltaic properties, which should be related to the nanoscale morphology of the active layer.

To illuminate the relationship between device properties and active layer morphology, detailed morphology characterizations are performed. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are measured to account for the correlation between molecular ordering and photovoltaic device performance. The one-dimensional GIWAXS profiles of the pure PM7 and IT4F films are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI). The PM7 film exhibits a (100) peak (q ≈ 0.30 Å−1) in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, suggesting a mixed molecular orientation. In contrast, the IT4F film shows a sharp (100) peak (q ≈ 0.32 Å−1) in the in-plane direction and a broadened (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction, indicating a preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial to the charge transport. The corresponding blend films are further investigated and the one-dimensional profiles and two-dimensional patterns are shown in Fig. 3a and d. The in-plane (100) peaks and out-of-plane (010) peaks are formed by combining the donor and acceptor peaks while the peak at q ≈ 0.38 Å−1 is assigned to the (001) peak of IT4F, according to our previous report. The (100) peaks can be divided into two peaks by Gaussian fitting according to the lattice parameters of the pure films and the results are summarized in Table 3. The effects of DT on the crystallization behavior of the components are investigated first. It's demonstrated that the increasing DT leads to the weakened crystallization of the polymer donor and an enhanced crystallization of the small molecule acceptor. The coherence length (CL) of PM7 decreases from 23.8 to 19.8 nm as the DT increases from 20 to 100 °C since an obviously broadened (001) peak of IT4F can be observed. The recede ordering of PM7 may be due to a reduced aggregation caused by the high temperature, which in turn weakens the restriction to the IT4F crystallization. The influences of the ST are further considered. The crystallization of both, PM7 and IT4F increases first and then decreases with elevated substrate temperature, as evidenced by the strongest (001) peak at 60 °C and the related crystal parameters. The CL values of the PM7 (100) peaks increase from 15.5 to 20.1 nm first and then decrease to 17.2 nm. The synergetic variation of PM7 and IT4F may be attributed to the crystallization kinetics such as nucleation and film formation time.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements are further taken to explain the interaction of the polymer on the small molecule crystallization. As reported in our previous work, an exothermic peak belonging to the small molecule acceptor can be observed during the first round of heating. The first heating DSC curve involves the history of film thermodynamics. The frozen chains regain energy and start to recrystallize when heated, thus the peak reflects information of the incomplete crystallization. The cold crystallization temperature,Tcc, is influenced by the crystallization of the polymer. The strong crystallization of the polymer will extrude the small molecules out of the donor and thus have a finite limitation on the small molecule, so that the amorphous small molecules begin to crystallize at a low temperature, namely low Tcc. The peak area of the DSC represents the amount of recrystallization, signifying the capacity of the further complete crystallization of small molecules when acquiring energy. As shown in Fig. 3b, an increased Tcc is surveyed when increasing the DT, which is consistent with the impaired packing of the polymer as seen in the GIWAXS data. In addition, the peak area shows a decreasing trend, which means a reduced non-crystallized amount of small molecule, that is to say, enhanced IT4F crystallization. As for the ST, Tcc and peak area exhibit a reversed trend compared to the CL values calculated from the GIWAXS profiles. The enhanced crystallization of the polymer leads to a lower Tcc while the improved crystallization of the small molecule results in a narrower peak area. The DSC data coincide with the GIWAXS data commendably and reveal that polymer crystallization exerts huge limitation on the small molecule packing at various DTs because of the temperature-dependent aggregation of PM7.
Further characterizations on the phase separation are done with resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to interpret the distinct performance caused by the processing temperature. For the RSoXS measurements, the X-ray energy of 285.2 eV is selected due to the high scattering contrast of PM7 and IT4F. The domain spacing is calculated by ξ = 1/smode, where ξ is the corresponding log-normal distribution in real space and smode is spatial distribution frequency determined by smode = q/2π. As shown in Fig. 3c and Table 4, films processed from different DTs show multi-length phase separation. The 20/60 and 100/60 films display both large and small length-scale domain sizes (obtained by half of the domain spacing, ξ/2, the domain sizes of 20/60 °C film are 32.6 and 135.8 nm while the domain sizes of 100/60 °C film are 32.3 and 116.7 nm). In contrast, the 60/60 °C film exhibits moderate phase separation with the domain sizes of 19.9 and 52.1 nm. According to the TEM pictures shown in Fig. 3e, large aggregates can be observed in the 20/60 °C TEM pattern while the 100 °C/60 °C TEM pattern exhibits large dendritic crystals. Considering the strong crystallization of PM7 in 20/60 °C film and IT4F 100/60 °C film, a reasonable speculation is that the large phase separation in the 20 °C/60 °C film is caused by the strong aggregation of PM7 while that in the 100 °C/60 °C film is induced by the wild packing of IT4F molecules. The bi-continuous morphology observed in the 60/60 °C TEM pattern is in good agreement with the RSoXS data. The phase separation and crystallization behavior exert great influence on the stability of the PM7:IT4F system, which has been demonstrated by Du et al. Due to the poor intrinsic miscibility, the acceptor will separate from the donor in the mixed region under illumination. Improving the initial crystallinity of the small molecule and keeping the composition close to the thermodynamic equilibrium will increase the device photostability. Du's work provides fundamental understanding on the effects of microstructure on the device stability and guides the morphology optimization methodology towards stable OSCs. Accordingly, the stronger IT4F crystallization at elevated DT will suppress the further IT4F diffusion under illumination. As a result, ameliorative photostability may be acquired by processing at high DT (100/60 °C). Concerning the films processed at various STs, the low and high temperatures lead to similar but slightly smaller domain size (45.8 nm for 60/20 °C film and 42.7 nm for 60/100 °C film). A miscible morphology can be surveyed from the 60/20 °C and 60/100 °C TEM patterns, which may be due to the weak crystallization of both the donor and acceptor. Low ST (60/20 °C) ensures the sufficient phase separation driven by the incompatibility of components, thus the devices may acquire much better stability. In contrast, devices processed at high ST (60/100 °C) will exhibit the worst stability since the composition is kinetically quenched, which is far from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Only single-length scale phase separation can be observed under these conditions which can be attributed to the weak crystallization since the multi-length scale phase separation may occur when the small molecule acceptors penetrate into the polymer phases and local crystallization phases are formed.

Since the detailed active layer morphology (orientation, crystallization and phase separation) is characterized, the correlation between device performance and manufacturing technique can be established and the reason why a moderate temperature (60/60 °C) coating is beneficial to the photovoltaic property can be given. On one hand, the unsuitable DT during slot-die coating leads to a severe phase separation because of the wild crystallization of the donor or acceptor. Thus, controlling the DT leads to an appropriate phase separation by controlling the temperature-dependent aggregation of the polymer donor; on the other hand, a too high/low ST results in a poor crystallinity of the blends, leading to a poor Jsc and FF. When the processing temperature is controlled at 60/60 °C, the enhanced crystallinity contributes to the improved FF. Moreover, the donor crystallinity is restrained due to the suppressed aggregation when heating. Thus, an improved amorphous donor-ordered acceptor interface is realized. Therefore, higher Jsc values can be achieved without sacrificing the Voc, and the balanced crystallinity gives rise to suitable domain size, which also contributes to exciton separation and charge transport. As a result, an excellent device performance is obtained.
To further understand the temperature dependence of the molecule packing, in situ GIWAXS (sketched in Fig. 4a) is performed to probe the crystallization kinetics during slot-die coating. On account of the various film formation time and to avoid beam damage, different sampling intervals are adopted. Time-dependent one-dimensional GIWAXS line-cuts are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI). Due to the violent disturbance of the solvent at q ≈ 1.3 Å−1, (100) peaks are conducted in batch to obtain global crystallization and the morphology evolution during film formation. The extracted lattice parameters (peak location, CL and peak area calculated from Fig. S9 by Gaussian fitting, ESI) are summarized in Fig. 4b–f. The crystallization process can be separated into three stages following reports from the literature. The first stage is the solvent evaporation stage, the second stage is the nucleation and crystal growth stage and the third one is the dried film stage. As shown in Fig. 4b, when the film is processed at a low ST (60/20 °C), solvent evaporates slowly and reaches its solubility limit at about 27 s, then starts to nucleate. As time goes on, the peak location value gets larger, while the CL and peak intensity increase at the same time, indicating the crystallization process in the film. The crystallization stops at about 35.8 s after which all the parameters remain constant. For the film process at high ST (60/100 °C), a rapid crystallization process can be observed where the peak location appears as soon as the coater moves away and stops quickly at about 3.8 s. Compared to the 60/100 °C film, the 60/20 °C film shows a tardy trend of crystallization, suggesting a tough nucleation/growth process. We speculate that nucleation is hard to occur at a low temperature. To verify this hypothesis, films processed at different ST are annealed at 60 °C for two hours and the DSC measurements are used to research the change of enthalpy. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI), the 60/100 °C sample shows no obvious exothermic peak which means all the nuclei have grown up after long time annealing. Taking the limited film formation time into consideration, we conclude that it is the short crystal growth time that leads to the weak crystallization. In contrast, the 60/20 °C sample shows an obvious exothermic peak which means further nucleation and growth during the DSC heating process. Since the crystallinity for the 60/20 °C sample is low even after a long film formation time, we speculate that the low substrate temperature processing is harmful to crystal nucleation. In conclusion, the weak crystallization at a low ST is caused by the few nucleation sites while the tight film formation time restricts the growth-up of nucleation, leading to the limited crystallization at high ST. Fig. 4d–f exhibit the morphology evolution at different DTs. As the DT rises, the crystallization time is extended from 5.0 s at 20 °C to 9.3 s at 100 °C. The stage of nucleation and growth is prolonged which may also be due to the restricted movement of the acceptor caused by the growing amorphous donor. However, the crystallization behavior of the donor and acceptor cannot be separated here. Thus, we cannot investigate the diverse crystallization trends of donor and acceptor induced by the DT.
To explain the crystallization and phase separation distinction caused by the raised DT, in situ UV-vis absorption measurements (as shown in Fig. 5a) are done to clarify the polymer aggregation evolution during the film formation. Due to the restriction of the detector, a much larger sampling interval (0.5 s) is adopted here. The raw UV-vis line-cuts and the time-dependent absorption contour maps are exhibited in Fig. S11 and S12 (ESI). Clear donor and acceptor absorption peaks can be obtained. Thus, the aggregation evolution of both components can be investigated. The peak intensity and location evolution of the corresponding devices are demonstrated in Fig. 5b–f. The whole film formation process can be divided into four stages. At the first stage, the intensity of both the donor and acceptor increases which exhibits two different increasing rates. We defined the later increasing rate as pre-aggregation rate because the rapid enhancement of intensity at first is induced by the increased concentration due to the evaporation of solvents. The intensity of the acceptor reaches its maximum at the end of the first stage and begins to decrease at the second stage due to the transformation of acceptor aggregates. At the third stage, the location of the acceptor begins to red shift, while the location of the donor remains constant during the whole process. Finally, all the parameters are fixed at the fourth stage. For films processed at 60/20 °C and 60/100 °C, the evolution results of the UV-vis absorption spectrum are similar to those of in situ GIWAXS. At the low ST, the intensity increases tardily, indicating the slow aggregation rate of the polymers (shown in Fig. 5b). In contrast, high ST manufacturing leads to a rapid film formation process (shown in Fig. 5c). No obvious IT4F peak location change (only 1 nm difference derived from the measurement error) can be detected under such high DT. However, films fabricated at various DTs exhibit different kinetic processes. For the low DT fabrication, stage two disappears and the change of acceptor peak location happens with a decrease of the peak intensity. While the acceptor peak intensity decreases first at the moderate temperature, then the transformation of the aggregates occurs. The period of the third stage enlarges as the DT rises. We hypothesize that amorphous polymers at an elevated DT confine the movement of the small molecules. Thus, the acceptors first come out from the donor region and then turn into other aggregates during the film formation. The pre-aggregation rates of the relevant devices are fitted (shown as the red lines in Fig. 5b–f) and summarized in Fig. 6c. When enhancing the DT from 20 to 60 °C, the donor pre-aggregation rate decreases while the acceptor pre-aggregation rate increases and more balanced pre-aggregation rates are obtained consequently. Thus, the DT exerts influence on the aggregation of polymers and acceptors which further affects the crystallization and phase separation. As for the effects of the ST, the low and unbalanced pre-aggregation rates lead to the low crystallinity at low ST. The high ST does not result in unsuitable pre-aggregation rates; instead, the rapid film formation time causes the inadequate crystallization and phase separation.
The in situ characterization demonstrates the morphology evolution during the film formation and explains how the distinctive morphology is formed at different manufacturing temperatures. According to the aforementioned results, proper aggregation state, balanced donor/acceptor pre-aggregation/crystallization kinetics and sufficient film formation time are required to obtain an optimized morphology. To give guidance on the fabrication conditions in future industrial-scale manufacturing, the solution state and film formation time are further characterized to describe the accurate thermodynamic state and kinetic process. The temperature-dependent UV-vis spectra of PM7 are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI), and a damped 0–0 peak and blue shift can be surveyed as reported in the literature. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to probe the solution behaviors of PM7 (shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. S14, ESI). When reaching the semi-dilute regime, polymer chains start to overlap, and the solution structure can be statistically characterized by a mesh size, which is an averaged length of a net surrounded by chain segments. The SANS profile can be fitted using the Ornstein–Zernike (OZ) model shown as follows:

I(0) is the scattering intensity at q = 0. It is proportional to the squared-mean of the density fluctuation, which is a measure for the structural inhomogeneity. ξ is the mesh size. The fitting results are shown in Table 5. The mesh size remains at the same level, without large-scale aggregation, nor is it a gelation or phase separation, which will produce much stronger intensity upturns. As a result, the different DTs won’t cause a direct imparity on aggregation size and shape. The enormous difference in the UV-vis spectra is induced by the intra-chain interaction. Thus, the DT gives rise to diverse chain movement ability, which appears as the various pre-aggregation rates. Fig. 6b shows the film formation time of films processed at different DT and ST. About 8–11 s film formation time is required to ensure the sufficient crystallization and phase separation. According to the temperature-dependent UV-vis spectra, I0–0/I0–1 ≈ 1 of the donor can be observed at the range of optimized DT, which may guide the choice of processing temperature in future industrial-scale manufacturing. An equal ST to the DT enables suitable pre-aggregation rates and sufficient film formation time. The schematic diagrams of morphology are shown in Fig. 6d and f–i. The overlarge phase separation caused by unsuitable DT and weak crystallization caused by improper ST lead to perishing device performance. Thus, as shown in Fig. 6e, admirable photovoltaic properties are acquired at the moderate DTs and STs.

In conclusion, we fabricate efficient PM7:IT4F devices by slot-die coating with a PCE of 13.2% at 60 (DT)/60 °C (ST). Ex situ and in situ morphology characterizations are performed to illustrate the effects of processing temperature on the morphology evolution. On the one hand, unsuitable DTs lead to severe phase separation due to the strong aggregation of the polymers at low DT and a wild crystallization of the small molecule at high DT, which gives rise to the inefficient exciton dissociation. On the other hand, the ST has a great influence on the crystallization process. Low ST results in a limited number of nucleation sites, while high ST restrains the crystal growth on account of the rapid solvent evaporation. As a result, low crystallinity happens at improper ST which does harm to the carrier lifetime. An ideal morphology with appropriate phase separation and crystallinity as much as possible can be acquired when fabricating at a moderate temperature, which contributes to the outstanding photovoltaic performance with an efficient exciton dissociation, prolonged carrier lifetime and suppressed non-radiative recombination losses. The applicable DT can be estimated by the equal intensity of polymer's 0–0 and 0–1 peaks according to the temperature-dependent UV-vis spectrum, in which case donor and acceptor exhibit balanced and suitable pre-aggregation rates, leading to the optimized morphology. In addition, the ST should be similar with the DT to ensure the adequate crystallization and phase separation. These results can provide guidelines on the processing technology of the future industrial-scale manufacturing since the donors of most current highly-efficient systems are polymers with temperature-dependent aggregation. Thus, our work on the relationship between structure evolution and photo physics in the slot-die printing process provides fundamental knowledge for the up-scale fabrication of organic solar cells.
