Cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots (QDs) utilized as additives have been incorporated intopolymer solar cells (PSCs) composed of poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazolealt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-ben-zothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.94% has been achieved, corresponding to 33% enhancement compared with the control devices. The introduction of CdSe QDs allows not only the improvement of charge transport properties but also tuning of the energy levels, which leads to a higher short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and open-circuit voltage (Voc).

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been widely investigated since 1995 due to their advantages of flexibility, light weight, low-cost and easy processing. However, due to the narrow absorption band width, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is difficult to improve, because only some of the photons of the solar spectrum can be utilized efficiently, leading to a small short-circuit density (Jsc). To date, the best PCE has been reported to be 10.8% by using a low band gap polymer as an electron donor. Compared with the commercial solar cell technology, achieving a higher PCE is still a challenge for PSCs.

Furthermore, because of the low mobility of polymer semiconductors, there is competition between the sweep-out of the photogenerated carriers by the built-in potential and recombination of the photogenerated carriers within the thin bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film, useful film thicknesses are limited by recombination. Thus, intensive research efforts have been devoted to enhance light harvesting and improve charge carrier transport properties without increasing the film thickness, such as active layer doping, buffer layer doping, tandem and ternary cascade structure; especially the ternary cascade solar cells have attracted great interest due to their good performance. Some polymers have been previously reported as additives to constitute cascade solar cells with the P3HT:PCBM blend. Two criteria must be fulfilled for the additive: firstly, energy levels of the additive should have an appropriate offset with respect to the donor and the acceptor; secondly, the additive could be used as both an electron acceptor and a transporter, as well as an electron donor and a transporter. Hence, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the additive are required to be intermediate to those of the donor and the acceptor, creating a cascade energy band structure. A quantum dot (QD) material possesses theoretical potential to improve the performance of PSCs because of its quantum effect and unique optical properties, which have attracted a great deal of interest. In addition, the HOMO and LUMO levels of a QD material can be adjusted via controlling its size to make it adaptable for ternary cascade cells. Many inorganic QDs have been used to replace fullerenes as electron acceptors to fabricate hybrid solar cells, which proposed an important approach to enhance the performance of PSCs.
In this paper, we achieved positive effects due to the addition of CdSe QDs to BHJ polymer solar cells based on a blend of poly [N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazolealt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-ben-zothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). In terms of optimizing the performance of PCDTBT:PC71BM photovoltaics cells, cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs were blended into a solution to form an assembling ternary cascade structure with various weight ratios (wt) and finally enhanced Jsc, open-circuit (Voc), and fill factor (FF) simultaneously.

The synthesis of CdSe QDs has been described elsewhere, and the diameter of CdSe QDs is 10–15 nm. The steady-state absorption and emission spectra of CdSe QDs are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that CdSe QDs have a strong ability of absorbing ultraviolet photons and emitting visible photons in the range of 600–650 nm, which is located in the absorption region of the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend. All devices in this work were fabricated with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/nano-crystal titanium dioxide (nc-TiO2)/PCDTBT:PC71BM:CdSe QDs/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag). The schematic structure and energy level of PSCs are shown in Fig. 2. The substrates were firstly cleaned by acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water. Then a TiO2 layer was spin coated onto the substrate as an electronic transport layer followed by postannealing at 450 °C for 2 h in the muffle furnace, and then allowed to cooled naturally. The solution containing 7 mg of PCDTBT and 28 mg of PC71BM in 1 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) doped with CdSe QDs was spin coated at 2000 RPM on top of the TiO2 layer in air as an active layer, and then postannealed at 70 °C for 20 min in the glove box. The doping ratios of QDs and the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend are 1.09 wt%, 2.18 wt%, 3.27 wt%, 4.36 wt%, and 6.54 wt% respectively. Subsequently, MoO3 and Ag were thermally evaporated as hole transport layer and anode, respectively. All the experimental conditions were optimized on the basis of previous experience. Every active area of the PSC devices was about 0.064 cm2.


The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of fabricated devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The photocurrent was measured under Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) solar illumination with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was measured using a photometer (International light, IL1400) and corrected using a standard silicon solar cell. Fig. 3 shows the J–V characteristics of the fabricated devices with different amounts of CdSe QD doping. Those values of control and doped devices were optimally obtained through several experiments and a typical average of 80 devices. The control devices without CdSe QDs exhibit a Jsc of 11.69 mA cm−2, a voltage of Voc of 0.83 V and a FF of 53.2%, leading to a PCE of 5.22%. As expected, the performance of devices doped with CdSe QDs was greatly improved, the PCE of cells with an optimum ratio of 2.18 wt% is 6.94%, with a Jsc of 12.98 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V and a FF of 60.8%. Jsc, Voc and FF are all improved, it is observed that Jsc increases from 11.69 mA cm−2 to 12.98 mA cm−2, Voc increases from 0.83 V to 0.88 V and FF increases from 53.2% to 60.8%, which directly lead to the enhancement of the PCE of 33% higher than control devices. At the same time, the devices doped with ratios of 1.09 wt%, 3.27 wt%, 4.36 wt%, and 6.54 wt% were also conducted, and some of them demonstrated a relatively higher PCE than undoped devices, such as the doping of cells with 1.09 wt%, 3.27 wt%, and 4.36 wt% gave PCEs of 5.98%, 6.47%, and 6.30%, respectively. We also found that 6.54 wt% doped devices produced a negative effect, which shows that excess doping damages photovoltaic properties. The detailed data of the performance of all the devices are summarized in Table 1.

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of all devices are shown in Fig. 4. As we can see, the IPCE of control devices shows a maximum of ∼62% at 600 nm. When 2.18 wt% QDs was incorporated, the IPCE of doped cells shows a maximum of ∼70% at 400 nm, a little higher than that of the control device. It is noted that the IPCE peak of the doped devices appeared to be blue-shifted compared to undoped ones. The IPCE peak movement is derived from the introduction of QDs, because the light absorption of CdSe QDs is focus in the region of 300–500 nm, which is shown in Fig. 1. The higher IPCE band width is larger than the lower IPCE band width of doped devices.
In order to shed light on the role of CdSe QDs in improving the performance of doped PSCs, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was performed for PCDTBT:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM:CdSe films at 400 nm excitation (Fig. 5). After excited by the pump light, the photoexcited electrons in the excited state could further absorb probe light and reach high energy levels or return to the ground state under stimulated radiation due to disturbance in probe light. Only excited-state absorption gives positive signals; others give negative signals.Fig. 5(a) and (b) are the transient absorption spectra of PCDTBT:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM:CdSe films respectively. All this information indicates the reasons for the change in photogenerated carrier population at corresponding energy levels. Fig. 5(c) displays the photoexcition signal decay in PCDTBT:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM:CdSe films. The signal response of PCDTBT:PC71BM:CdSe exhibits a faster decay than that of PCDTBT:PC71BM, which indicates that the ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer has occurred. Fig. 5(c) shows that not only do the doped cells exhibit a large number of initial mobile carriers than the undoped cell, but the carriers are also extracted more rapidly, which is consistent with having more balanced charge transport, and hence, there is no space charge buildup affecting the internal field as in the case of undoped devices. This process is beneficial for electron transfer across the whole active layer, which may explain the improvement of Jsc and FF of doped devices.
To further confirm the effect of QDs on charge transport properties, we fabricated two kinds of single carrier devices. The hole-only device configuration is ITO/MoO3/active layer/MoO3/Ag, and the MoO3 connected with ITO is the electron blocking layer. The electron-only device configuration is ITO/TiO2/active layer/BCP/Ag, the BCP is a hole blocking layer. The J–V characteristics of these two kinds of devices in the dark are shown in Fig. 6. We observed that the Jsc values of the doped devices in Fig. 6(a) have been enhanced irrespective of doping amounts for the hole-only devices, which indicates QD doping into the active layer is beneficial to enhance hole transport properties thus increasing the Jsc of doped devices. At the same time, the largest Jsc value with the doping amount of 2.18 wt% was obtained, which is consistent with the tendency of the photocurrent curves in Fig. 3. Fig. 6(b) demonstrates good electron transport capacity of the doped devices, and presents a similar effect as in Fig. 6(a), which suggests that both hole and electron transport properties are substantially improved. To investigate the effect of CdSe QDs on the hole and electron transfer properties, we made a realistic evaluation on the apparent charge carrier mobility in the active layer according to J–V characteristics of single charge carrier devices. The charge carrier mobility was calculated from the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, which includes field dependence. At a typical applied voltage of 1.0 V, corresponding to an electric field of 105 V cm−1 across the bulk of a 100 nm device, apparent hole mobilities of 1.46 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and apparent electron mobilities of 4.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been determined for the 2.18 wt% QD doped and control devices, respectively. That is to say, upon the introduction of CdSe QDs, mobilities of both holes and electrons increase and a more balanced charge transport in the cells can be achieved. These are direct evidence that charge transport capacity is largely enhanced by CdSe QD doping and contributes to the improvement of Jsc.

Fig. 7(a) shows the dark J–V curves of PSCs with 2.18 wt% CdSe doping and without doping. It can be seen that the diffusion current dominated regime is shifted toward higher forward bias in the case of the incorporation of QDs, suggesting that the built-in potential increases with the introduction of QDs. Impedance spectra were also recorded for these two kinds of devices, which is shown in Fig. 7(b). The impedance of the doped devices is much smaller than that of the undoped devices. The series resistance is listed in Table 1. The doped devices possess smaller series resistance, which corresponds to the improved FF of PSCs. The Voc of PSCs is limited by the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. But most of the PSCs could not reach this fundamental limit under standard testing conditions, the energy loss being typically attributed to charge carrier recombination at the interfaces. From the energy levels in Fig. 2(b), it is very clear that the HOMO and the LUMO of CdSe QDs are located between the corresponding values of PCDTBT and PC71BM, which will create a large energy difference between HOMODonor–LUMOAcceptor of PCDTBT:CdSe and CdSe:PC71BM than that of PCDTBT:PC71BM contributing to the increase of Voc. Meanwhile the charge transfer barrier between the electron donor (PCDTBT) and the electron acceptor (PC71BM) can also be reduced when doping CdSe QDs into the PCDTBT:PC71BM matrix, and excitons can be dissociated effectively into the junction of PCDTBT:CdSe and CdSe:PC71BM. The enhanced Voc upon doping of CdSe QDs is a direct consequence of reduced recombination at PCDTBT/PC71BM interfaces. In our previous work, PFDTBT QDs have been introduced into an active layer of polymer solar cells, which enhances charge transport. Compared to PFDTBT QDs, CdSe QDs not only contribute to the charge transfer but also increases Voc. The doped QDs block the recombination of electrons in PC71BM with holes in PCDTBT, which leads to a decrease in dark current in cascade devices, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The reduction in dark current is correlated with the enhancement of Voc. Moreover, the ternary cascade structure can accelerate the carrier transfer, resulting in an increase in the extraction of charge carriers. When the doping concentration of QDs is greater than 2.18 wt%, the performance of the cells gets a reduced trend. The heavy doping may result in greater roughness compared to that obtained from light doping of a layer with a lower QD concentration, which indicates that some QDs directly come into contact with the MoO3/Ag electrode and a more serious charge recombination is obtained. Fig. 8 presents tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (surface area: 5 × 5 μm2) of films with 0, 1.09%, and 2.18 wt% QDs. Note that the blend films incorporating 1.09 wt% and 2.18 wt% of QDs [Fig. 8(b) and (c)] possessed a rather uneven surface [root-mean-square (RMS) roughness: 12.3 nm and 15.5 nm] relative to that obtained from PCDTBT:PC71BM (RMS roughness: 8.7 nm) (Fig. 8(a)). A rougher active surface layer is more suitable for charge transport to the relative electrodes, thus a great portion of the photogenerated electrons and holes reduced recombination within the blends.

In summary, we have demonstrated that simultaneous enhancement of Voc, Jsc and FF can be achieved in highly efficient PSCs by simply incorporating CdSe QDs into the PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer, resulting in a PCE of up to 6.94%. The effects of the additive on the improvement of the device performance are shown to be increased twofold: an enhancement of Voc is due to the increase of the energy difference between the acceptor and the donor and the reduced recombination of electrons and holes; the increase of Jsc and FF is attributed to the improvement of charge carrier transport properties. We believe that further improvements in the performance of devices incorporating quantum dots are possible. The approach here provides a simple and versatile method to optimize PSCs and may set a goal to increase the efficiency of devices to 10%.
