A simple one-pot method to prepare complex morphology-tunable hierarchical TiO2 microspheres consisting of radially assembled single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods is developed by combining an acid thermal crystallization process and a self-assembly process of the nanorods via a solvothermal amphiphile–water microreactor strategy. Using P25 nanoparticles as void fillers to generate a mesoporous electrode film, the microsphere based photoanode exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.95% at an anode film thickness of 27.2 μm, highlighting the importance of material architecture tailoring in improving the electron transport properties of dye-sensitized solar cells.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively investigated as one of the most promising low-cost alternatives to conventional silicon based photovoltaics. The main components of DSSCs are a Pt cathode, a redox-active electrolyte and a photoanode consisting of a dye-sensitized semiconductor nanocrystalline film deposited on a transparent conducting substrate. A high-performance photoanode is expected to possess a large specific surface area for sufficient dye loading, a strong scattering effect to compensate the low light absorption efficiency of the sensitizer (typically N719 or N3) in the red region, and effective electron transport to reduce charge recombination. However, the above features usually negate each other for nanocrystalline based anode films. For instance, thick photoanode films prepared using TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit a large specific surface area, inevitably accompanied by a large number of grain boundaries, which is unfavourable for efficient electron transport in the TiO2 matrix. Besides, the strong scattering effect requires large particles, the specific surface area of which is usually low, leading to reduction of dye loading.

Recently, hierarchical TiO2 microspheres have been synthesized and investigated as photoanode materials. The microspheres are capable of enhancing the scattering effect of the photoanode due to their micron size while maintaining or even increasing the surface area due to their nanoscale primary units, such as nanoparticles and nanosheets, thus improving the DSSC performance. Single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods exhibit a fast electron transport due to their low density of sub-bandgap defect states, which increases the electron diffusion length in DSSC photoanodes. To integrate the effects of large specific surface area, strong scattering and efficient electron transport into a single photoanode, hierarchical microspheres constructed with single crystal rutile TiO2 nanorods have been developed and utilized to prepare the DSSC anodes through direct growth and screen printing of the microspheres on a transparent conducting substrate. However, the former approach may face challenges in production scale up and film thickness control. For the latter, Na+ residues derived from sodium salts involved in the microsphere synthesis process can limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs, therefore displaying a modest PCE of 3.57%, only 13% enhancement compared to that of P25 based anodes at a film thickness of 16 μm. Besides, big rod bundles with a diameter of more than 100 nm formed by densely packed nanorods in microspheres decrease the surface area of the photoanodes, only giving a PCE of 2.94% at an anode film thickness of ∼20 μm.
Herein, we demonstrate a facile solvothermal strategy to prepare single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod constructed microspheres. The nanorods are radially assembled without the formation of rod bundles and their diameters are carefully controlled for high specific surface area. The conceived strategy involves the use of n-butanol as an amphiphile for the formation of microreactors in which an acid thermal crystallization process and a self-assembly process of the TiO2 nanorods into microspheres occur during the one-step solvothermal reaction. Instead of titanium alkoxides, TiCl3 is utilized as the Ti source, which has the attractive attributes of high water solubility to enable rutile TiO2 nanorod formation in the water-rich microreactors, as well as high stability and low cost. In addition, the current method does not require any pre-treatment, such as the mixing of the reaction precursor by stirring or sonication, thus making this approach very simple for particle morphology tunability and economical for large scale production. Briefly, TiCl3 acidic aqueous solution diluted with an equal volume of DI water was added into a Teflon-lined autoclave, followed by the addition of n-butanol. Subsequently, the autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven at 150 °C for 4 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, the product was washed using a centrifuge and dried in air (please find experiment details in the ESI). The obtained powder, labelled as T150, was used as the photoanode material and the device performance was systematically evaluated.
TEM images of the as-prepared T150 in Fig. 1a and b exhibit a dandelion-like spherical morphology, consisting of numerous TiO2 nanorods radiating from the center with an average diameter of 14 nm. From the HRTEM image, the lattice distance highlighted in Fig. 1c was determined to be 0.328 nm, which corresponds to rutile (110) planes, indicating that the nanorod growth direction is along the [001] orientation. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 1d confirms the single-crystalline nature of the TiO2 nanorods, which is very crucial for DSSCs, as fast electron transport through the single-crystalline nanorods can be achieved for enhanced charge collection efficiency at the photoanodes. Besides, the smooth side surfaces and high crystallinity of the nanorods are capable of suppressing the electron trapping at surface defects.Fig. 2a shows the FESEM image of T150 microspheres with radially assembled nanorods but without the formation of rod bundles, which brings about a high specific surface area. The size distribution of the microspheres was also examined and the result is displayed in Fig. 2b, showing that the mean diameter of T150 microspheres is 831 nm.
The TEM image in Fig. S1a exhibits a rod-like morphology of a control sample synthesized under the same conditions as for the T150 but without the addition of n-butanol. The diameter of the TiO2 nanorods is ∼14 nm and the rod length varies in the range of 14–80 nm. Based on the comparison of the morphology of T150 and its control sample (labelled as T150B-), a formation mechanism of the hierarchical microspheres is proposed and presented in Scheme 1. The water-rich microreactor droplets formed by an amphiphile–water system is an ideal soft template for self-assembly of the nanocrystals into a three dimensional microstructure. Highly acidic conditions and selective adsorption of Cl− on the rutile (110) plane favour the formation of the rutile phase and promotes the anisotropic growth of TiO2 into nanorods along the [001] orientation. Therefore, random TiO2 nanorods form in the water phase in the presence of HCl (from the acidic TiCl3 solution) at the beginning of the reaction. Cl− adsorption on the (110) plane gives rise to repulsive forces between the side walls of the nanorods. Consequently, the nanorods join on the (001) plane (the highest energy plane of rutile TiO2) and assemble into a spherical structure in the microreactors to minimize their surface area and reduce the total free energy. The repulsive force between the nanorods avoids the aggregation of the nanorods into rod bundles, hence resulting in a more loosely packed structure and a larger specific surface area of the microspheres, laying the foundation for high performance DSSCs. The grooves at the edges and joints of the assembled nanorods are favourable sites for adatom attachment to form new atomic layers and eventually new single crystals with smooth side surfaces. As the reaction progresses, microspheres increase in size, finally forming hierarchical TiO2 microspheres consisting of radially assembled single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods. In contrast, without the restriction of the microreactors, the random TiO2 nanorods can move freely in Brownian motion within the reaction precursor and thus are unable to assemble into the microspheres.
To investigate the effect of reaction temperature, solvothermal syntheses were carried out at 110, 130, 170 and 190 °C to prepare a series of samples, which were labelled with the corresponding reaction temperature. We observed a temperature-dependent morphological evolution of the microspheres (evident in Fig. S2 and Table S1). As the reaction temperature increases, the particle size of the microspheres decreases while the diameter of the nanorods increases, which can be attributed to the enhanced mixing of water and n-butanol to generate a smaller water phase “microreactor” and a faster growth kinetics of nanorods induced by high temperature. Moreover, the spacing of the nanorods was observed to become larger with increasing temperature, and destruction of the spheres occurred at 190 °C, indicating the loss of stability of the microemulsion at this temperature. The specific surface area of the microspheres is inevitably affected by the above morphological changes and determined to be 84.69, 97.07, 89.24, and 63.68 m2 g−1 for T110, T130, T150 and T170, respectively. The surface area of T190 is 49.28 m2 g−1, lower than that (58.18 m2 g−1) of P25, while the T150B- shows the highest surface area of 97.54 m2 g−1. XRD patterns of T110, T130, T150 and T150B- primarily exhibit characteristic peaks of rutile TiO2 as shown in Fig. S3, which is consistent with HRTEM observation. For T170 and T190, the peaks corresponding to anatase TiO2 appear. We speculate that at higher temperatures, there may be less HCl for the anisotropic growth of rutile nanorods due to the increased dissolution of HCl in n-butanol. The crystallinity of the microspheres is improved at high reaction temperature, which is revealed by the decreased full width at half maximum of the diffraction peaks. UV-Vis DRS in Fig. S4 shows that the reflectance of the microspheres is more than 80% in the range of 450–800 nm, which is higher than those (around 70%) of P25 and T150B-, confirming the enhanced light-scattering properties of the microspheres.
The five hierarchical TiO2 microspheres, as well as the P25 and T150B- (as reference), were utilized to prepare photoanodes using a doctor-blade technique. The active area and film thickness of the anodes were controlled to be 0.2 cm2 and 9 μm, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of seven devices, the performance parameters of which are summarized in Table S2 for comparison. For the hierarchical microspheres, the trend of short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the photoanodes corresponds to their specific surface areas, indicating that Jsc is mainly determined by the dye loading. With the highest specific surface area, the T130 based device gives the highest Jsc of 9.48 mA cm−2, while the Jsc of the devices based on T110, T150, T170 and T190 is 8.89, 9.32, 7.91 and 7.36 mA cm−2, respectively. The P25 based photoanode delivers a Jsc of 8.31 mA cm−2, higher than that of the T170 based photoanode and close to that of the T150 based device. Anatase TiO2 nanoparticle-based anodes usually exhibit a high surface area per unit film volume and consist of high surface –OH group density, which enhance dye loading. These reasons may contribute to the high Jsc of the P25 based device. Rutile nanocrystals, in general, show superior light-scattering characteristics and single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods, with a length up to several hundreds of nanometers, are capable of enhancing the charge collection efficiency of DSSC photoanodes. Although T150B- exhibits the highest specific surface area, its photoanode only delivers a Jsc of 7.66 mA cm−2. The lower current density may be resulted from the relatively lower scattering effect and electron transport rate through the randomly arranged TiO2 nanorods with smaller diameter and length, reinforcing the importance of the hierarchical structure of the microspheres in photoanode performance enhancement. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the microsphere based devices are generally higher than those of P25 and T150B- reference cells, which indicates efficient electron transfer in the photoanodes consisting of hierarchical microspheres of single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods with a length of a few hundred nanometers. Voc and FF increase from T110 to T150 based photoanodes, which reflects the reduced internal resistance probably resulting from the enhanced electron transport in TiO2 nanorods with improved crystallinity at higher temperature. Compared to those of T150, the Voc and FF of T170 and T190 based devices decrease, which is ascribed to the formation of the anatase phase in these two samples, which probably increase the grain boundaries and sub-bandgap defects and reducing the charge collection efficiency. With a large surface area (89.24 m2 g−1), the enhanced scattering effect (∼18% reflectance improvement compared to that of P25), and efficient electron transport (highly crystalline rutile TiO2 single-crystalline nanorods), the T150 based device delivers the highest PCE of 4.90%, more than 20% higher than that of the conventional P25 reference cell (4.06%).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of T150, T150B- and P25 based devices were measured to offer a physical insight into the effect of the TiO2 microspheres on DSSC performance enhancement. Fig. 4a displays the IPCE curves as a function of wavelength. The enhanced IPCE of the T150 based device over a wide range of 400–750 nm is attributed to the increased light harvesting efficiency from improved dye loading, light reflectance and electron transport. Nyquist plots of the devices in Fig. 4b illustrate three semicircles, the diameters of which represent the impedance of the corresponding processes. The first semicircles measured in the high-frequency (kHz) range represent the Faraday resistance of the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The second semicircles in the medium-frequency (1–100 Hz) range reflect the electron transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, which is the most decisive factor in DSSCs. The third semicircles obtained in the low-frequency (mHz) range are related to the Warburg diffusion process of I3− in the electrolyte. As the counter electrodes are exactly the same for all devices, the Faraday resistance of the three cells exhibits similar diameter values. Compared to the second semicircle diameter of P25 (∼22.3 ohm) and T150B- (∼35.9 ohm) reference cells, an obvious decrease in that of the T150 device (∼14.7 ohm) is observed, which indicates enhanced charge transport of the T150 based photoanodes, attributed to the fast electron transport in the long (>800 nm) single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods with less grain boundaries and lower density of sub-bandgap defect states. The inefficient electron transport in the T150B- anode is confirmed by the large diameter of its second semicircle. The high impedance may be associated with the large number of grain boundaries between the small-sized nanorods which disfavours electron transport. The third semicircle of the T150 based device exhibits a slightly smaller diameter compared to those of P25 and T150B- reference cells, which could be attributed to the bigger inter-particle pores that facilitate the diffusion of I3− in the photoanode.
From the SEM images of the anode films (Fig. S5), numerous voids can be observed in the T150 based photoanode. The presence of these large voids generates dead space and reduce dye adsorption. We therefore undertook a strategy to use P25 as a void filler, due to its smaller size and ∼80% of anatase phase which could improve dye loading of the T150 based photoanode. The weight ratio of T150 to P25 was adjusted to 60:40 to achieve a mesoporous electrode film of high void filling (Fig. S5d). The devices prepared using this ratio were optimized by adjusting the anode film thickness and the photovoltaic performances of all the devices are summarized in Table 1. The Jsc increases while the Voc and FF decrease with increasing film thickness. The composite photoanode with the thickness of 9.1 μm gives a PCE of 5.69%, ∼16% and 40% higher than those of T150 and P25 based solar cells with the same thickness. The optimal PCE (7.95%) is obtained at an anode film thickness of 27.2 μm, with the Jsc of 18.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.745 and FF of 56.7%. The optimal film thickness of the nanoparticle based photoanodes is generally 10–14 μm corresponding to the typical electron diffusion length of such films. The increased optimal film thickness of the current T150 based composite anode reflects the improved electron diffusion in the anode film due to the incorporation of the hierarchical TiO2 microspheres. Therefore, this study has shown that the electron transport properties of DSSC photoanode films can be enhanced through careful material architecture tailoring and design.

We have developed a simple synthetic method to prepare complex hierarchical TiO2 microspheres constructed with radially assembled single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods by combining an acid thermal crystallization process and a self-assembly process of the nanorods via a solvothermal amphiphile–water microreactor strategy. The morphology and crystallinity of the hierarchical microspheres are temperature dependent, which allows the control of the diameter and spacing of the nanorods by adjusting the reaction temperature to endow the microspheres with high specific surface area. A significant improvement (20%) in the PCE of the T150 based device is achieved compared to that of the conventional P25 reference cell, which is attributed to the synergistic effects of the large specific surface area, enhanced scattering effect, and efficient electron transport properties of the T150 microspheres. Using P25 nanoparticles as void fillers, the T150 based photoanode exhibits a maximum PCE of 7.95% at an anode film thickness of 27.2 μm. The current one-pot solvothermal synthetic strategy may be extended for the preparation of other types of metal oxide microspheres with nano/micro hierarchical structure.
