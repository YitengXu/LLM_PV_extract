Poly(selenylene vinylene) (PSV) is a close analog to the extensively studied poly(thienylene vinylene) (PTV) polymers, and possesses unique properties originating from the larger, more polarizable Se atoms. Currently, little is known about the structure–property relationships of PSV derivatives, caused by the lack of efficient synthetic methods that are capable of producing systematically varied polymer structures beyond the prototypical alkylated version. We report herein a facile synthetic methodology, combining acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) and post-polymerization modification (PPM) techniques, for the preparation of a series of novel PSV polymers bearing different aromatic units cross-conjugated with the main-chain. Such structural modification allows fine-tuning of PSV electronic properties through main-chain/side-chain interactions and leads to fundamental understanding on the structure–property relationships of this class of unique materials. Our methodology is highly versatile in installing tailor-designed cross-conjugated side-chains to PSVs, as well as to other poly(arylene vinylene)s containing different heteroarenes.

Since the discovery of metallic conductivity in doped polyacetylene that led to the Nobel Prize in 2000, conjugated polymers (CPs) have evolved into a vast research field and been considered promising to revolutionize next-generation optoelectronics including organic superconductors, biological sensors, organic field-effect transistors, nonlinear optics, organic memory devices, thermoelectrics, and organic photovoltaics. Poly(arylene vinylene)s (PAVs), with main-chains consisting of alternating aromatic and double bond moieties, are a prototypical class of CPs but have received much less attention than conventional polyaromatic systems. The insertion of a small-sized double bond between adjacent aromatic units can greatly release steric hindrance and lead to better main-chain coplanarity in PAVs. So far, only two types of PAVs have been extensively studied, i.e., poly(phenylene vinylene)s (PPVs) and poly(thienylene vinylene)s (PTVs). Compared with poly(para-phenylenes) (PPPs) and poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs), comparably substituted PPVs and PTVs respectively possess reduced bandgaps and enhanced crystallinity. Intriguingly, replacing the phenyl units in PPVs with thiophene as in PTVs generates new properties not found in PPVs, including the disappearance of fluorescence caused by the existence of a low-lying dark 2Ag excited state and activated singlet fission process that is promising for overcoming the Shockley–Queisser limit in solar cell efficiencies. Thus, introduction of other heteroarenes into the main-chain of PAVs may generate new materials with unexpected properties, and improve our fundamental understanding in previously under-explored areas of CP research.

Substituting thiophene with selenophene has recently become an attractive strategy in CP synthesis. Compared with S atoms, the Se atom possesses larger atomic radius and polarizability, leading to less aromaticity in selenophene rings and enhanced electron accepting ability caused by σ*–π* interactions between the Se atom and ring double bonds. As a result, Se-containing CPs typically display reduced optical bandgaps than their S analogs. The more polarizable Se atoms can also lead to stronger intermolecular interactions between neighboring polymer chains, resulting in a higher degree of overall rigidity and higher charge carrier mobility. As the close analogue of PTVs, poly(selenylene vinylene) (PSV) has been rarely explored. The only examples of PSVs were prepared by Heeney et al. and Qin et al., through cross-coupling reactions and acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization, respectively, and possess linear alkyl groups as the only side-chains. These PSVs have shown reduced bandgaps and enhanced field-effect mobility when compared with similarly alkylated PTVs, and are thus promising materials for optoelectronic applications. However, current synthetic methodologies have not been able to diversify the PSV structures for a better understanding in structure–property relationships nor toward tailored adjustment of physical and electronic properties. Such ability of structural modification is intriguing as previously demonstrated in PTV derivatives by installing conjugated side-chains onto the main-chain thiophene moieties, which resulted in lower bandgaps, turn-on of fluorescence, and improved device performance. Other examples of using AMDET and PPM methodologies for the synthesis of substituted poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and poly(fluorenylene vinylene) (PFV) derivatives have been reported previously. In this account, we describe a facile synthetic methodology that first produces a novel brominated PSV polymer intermediate through ADMET, from which a series of cross-conjugated side-chains are then installed through cross-coupling reactions in a post-polymerization modification fashion.

All reagents and solvents were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar unless otherwise noted. 2,3,5-Tribromoselenophene and (5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)trimethylstannane were synthesized according to literature procedure. THF was distilled from Na/benzophenone prior to use. The 300.13 MHz 1H and 75.48 MHz 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III Solution 300 spectrometer. All solution 1H and 13C NMR spectra were referenced internally to solvent signals. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses were performed in chloroform with 0.5% (v/v) triethylamine (1 mL min−1) using a Waters Breeze system equipped with a 2707 autosampler, a 1515 isocratic HPLC pump, and a 2414 refractive index detector. Two styragel columns (Polymer Laboratories; 5 μm Mix-C), which were kept in a column heater at 35 °C, were used for separation. The columns were calibrated with polystyrene standards (Varian). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC spectrometer over a wavelength range of 240–900 nm. Raman spectra were obtained on a DXR SmartRaman spectrometer over a frequency range of 50.5–3350 cm−1. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at 25 °C on a CH Instrument CHI604xD electrochemical analyzer using a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode calibrated using ferrocene redox couple (4.8 eV below vacuum). GC-MS measurements were performed on an Agilent 7820A system.


Polymer/PC61BM blend solutions were prepared by dissolving the polymer and PC61BM at predetermined weight ratios in chlorobenzene at a polymer concentration of 1 wt% and stirred at room temperature for 3–4 hours in a nitrogen glovebox (Innovative Technology, model PL-He-2GB, O2 < 0.5 ppm, H2O < 0.5 ppm). Solar cell devices were fabricated according to the following procedure: ITO-coated glass substrates (China Shenzhen Southern Glass Display Ltd; 8 Ω □−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in detergent water, DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, each for 15 min. These ITO-coated glasses were further treated by UV-ozone (PSD Series, Novascan) for 60 min before being transferred to a nitrogen glovebox (Innovative Technology, model PL-He-2GB, O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm) for MoO3 deposition. MoO3 (10 nm) was deposited using an Angstrom Engineering Amod deposition system at a base vacuum level of <4 × 10−7 Torr. The PSVs/fullerene blend solution was first filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter and spin-coated on top of the MoO3 layer at 800 rpm for 30 s. Al (100 nm) was thermally evaporated through patterned shadow masks as cathodes, the size of the active areas is ca. 7.1 mm2. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measuring unit under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) generated by a Xe arc-lamp based Newport 67005 150 W solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated using a Newport thermopile detector (model 818P-010-12) equipped with a Newport 1916-C Optical Power Meter.


CH3COOH (10 mL), H2O (26 mL) and zinc powder (11 g, 168.3 mmol) were charged into a round-bottom flask and heated up to 114 °C to reflux for 10 min. 2,3,5-Tribromoselenophene (10.2 g, 27.7 mmol) was added into the flask after the reaction mixture was cooled down, and then the mixture was put back into the oil bath to reflux for 4 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with diethyl ether (2 × 50 mL); the combined organic phase was then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After solvent removal under reduced pressure, the residue was further purified by vacuum distillation to give a colorless liquid (3.8 g, 66%). 1H NMR (300.13 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 7.27 (dd, 1H), 7.87 (dd, 1H), δ (ppm) = 7.92 (dd, 1H). 13C NMR (75.48 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 110.66, 126.20, 131.39, 132.47.

The reaction mixture was covered with aluminum foil and kept at room temperature for 24 h.

Grubbs second-generation catalyst (16 mg, 0.019 mmol) in 5.5 mL of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was then added, and the reaction mixture was kept under dynamic vacuum while the condenser was cooled to 5 °C using a circulating chiller. The reaction mixture was gradually heated to 60 °C over 1 h and refluxed for 24 h. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature, 16 mg of Grubbs second-generation catalyst in 3 mL of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene was added, and the reaction mixture was refluxed at 60 °C under dynamic vacuum for another 24 h. Such a process was repeated for a total of five times, and the mixture was poured into Acetone (200 mL) to precipitate the polymer, which was purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexanes, and chloroform to give the title compound as a black solid (0.60 g, 79% yield). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 0.88 (t, 3H), 1.25 (m, 18H), 1.53 (m, 2H), 2.52 (t, 2H), 6.72 (m, 2H). 13C NMR (125.75 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 14.16, 22.74, 29.75, 31.98, 117.71, 123.86, 138.61, 143.02.

The reaction mixture was dried under high vacuum to get rid of the solvent, and the residue was used in next step without further purification. The residual polymer from the previous step, THF (25 mL), H2O (5 mL), and HCl (0.5 mL) were added into a one-neck flask. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h.

SEC (CHCl3, 1 mL min−1): Mn = 13.1 kDa, Mw = 21.7 kDa, Đ = 1.7.

Synthetic procedures of monomers and cross-conjugated PSVs are summarized in Scheme 1. The starting material, 2,3,5-tribromoselenophene, was prepared according to reported literature. De-bromination at the 2- and 5-substitution positions through reduction reaction using metallic zinc in acetic acid led to 3-bromoselenophene (1). Nickel-catalysed Grignard cross-coupling reaction of 1 with n-dodecylmagnesium bromide produced 3-dodecylselenophene (2). The long alkyl chain was chosen in order to ensure sufficient solubility of resulting PSV polymers without compromising efficient monomer synthesis and purification. Monomer 3 was obtained by bromination of 2 with an excess of bromine, which was subsequently subjected to Stille coupling reaction with 2 equivalents of tri-n-butyl(1-propenyl)tin to install propenyl groups selectively onto the 2- and 5-positions leading to monomer SV-Br. The selectivity of the reaction originates from the higher reactivity of the bromine atoms at the 2- and 5-positions, similar to that of thiophene derivatives we demonstrated previously, and was confirmed by de-bromination reaction using isopropylmagnesium bromide followed by quenching with H2O, leading to 3-dodecyl-2,5-dipropenylselenophene with similar NMR spectra as that of 3-decyl-2,5-dipropenylselenophene we prepared previously through a different route. Further evidence came from GC-MS analyses of SV-Br as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). Three peaks are resolved in the GC trace of SV-Br, representing the different stereoisomers caused by trans and cis configurations of the double bonds at the asymmetric 2- and 5-positions, although we are unable to identify the relative abundance of each isomer due to the overlap of NMR signals. All three GC peaks gave exactly the same mass isotope patterns that match the calculated ones for SV-Br.


SV-Br was then subjected to acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization toward the brominated intermediate poly(3-bromo-4-dodecylselenylene vinylene) (PSV-Br). ADMET is a versatile polymerization technique on diene monomers, which has been shown to tolerate a wide variety of functional groups and applied for the preparation of precision-substituted polyolefins and poly(arylene vinylene)s. The ADMET polymerization of SV-Br was conducted in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) under dynamic vacuum at 60 °C in the presence of Grubbs second generation catalyst (G2) that was added in portions during 5 days in order to achieve high monomer conversion and polymer molecular weight. It's worth noting that the addition of 10 mol% CuI into the reaction mixture could greatly facilitate the polymerization rate, similar to the case of brominated PTV synthesis we demonstrated previously. Such metathesis rate acceleration effect by adding Lewis acids is likely caused by the phosphine sponge effect previously studied by Wagener et al. on olefin metathesis assisted by boron-containing compounds.PSV-Br was isolated in high yields by precipitation into methanol and extensively purified by Soxhlet extractions as a black powder. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements against polystyrene standards (Fig. S2) gave a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of ca. 13.2 kDa, corresponding to an average degree of polymerization (DP) of ca. 33, and a dispersity index (Đ) of 3.0, consistent with the step-growth nature of ADMET polymerization. The absence of any visible signals from terminal propenyl groups in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S5) of PSV-Br also suggests relatively high molecular weight of the polymer. The overall very broad signals indicate regio-random nature of PSV-Br, caused by the similar reactivity of propenyl groups at the 2- and 5-positions, similar to that of PTV derivatives we demonstrated previously.
The unique feature of our synthetic method is the preparation of PSV polymers with a bromine substituent at every selenophene unit along the polymer backbone, which is incompatible with the previously employed Stille coupling polymerization, and can be conveniently used for the installation of functional side-chains through post-polymerization modification (PPM) reactions. As shown in Scheme 1, we have successfully attempted to install thienyl derivatives as the cross-conjugated side-chains, leading to PSV-Th, PSV-ThCHO, and PSV-ThCN, respectively containing simple thienyl, aldehyde functionalized thienyl, and thienyl groups bearing strongly electron-withdrawing cyanoester substituents. Conversions of such PPM reactions through Stille coupling on polymeric substrates are studied by 1H NMR spectra of these PSVs as shown in Fig. 1. Careful analyses and integrations of these NMR signals suggest close to quantitative, if not 100%, conversions of the PPM reactions. For example, by setting the integration value of the 1H NMR signal from the CH2 group directly attached to selenophene to 2.00, the integration values of signals from the aldehyde protons in PSV-ThCHO (Fig. S14) and ester methyl protons in PSV-ThCN (Fig. S16) are 1.01 and 3.00, respectively, comparing favourably with the theoretical values for quantitative substitution at 1.00 and 3.00. Noticeably, the post-polymerization modified PSVs displayed sharper and more resolved proton signals compared with that from PSV-Br, presumably due to less aggregation caused by the larger aromatic side-chains when compared with the single bromine atoms in PSV-Br. SEC traces of these cross-conjugated PSVs (Fig. S2) show very similar profiles as that of PSV-Br, suggesting the absence of any significant polymer cross-linking or degradation during the PPM reactions. DPs of these cross-conjugated PSVs are estimated from the SEC Mn values, and the physical and electronic properties of all polymers, including PSV-H (i.e. poly(3-decylselenylene vinylene) we synthesized previously) are summarized in Table 1. The slightly different DPs among the cross-conjugated PSVs were likely caused by the different interactions between the functional groups and SEC column materials and/or different polymer aggregation behaviours in solution. It is also noticed that PSV-Br has a higher dispersity (Đ) than those of the cross-conjugated PSVs caused by high molecular weight shoulders in its SEC profile, which is presumably due to pronounced aggregation effects in this polymer induced by the smaller Br substituents when compared with larger aromatic side-chains in the other PSVs studied.

The newly prepared PSVs were first characterized by Raman spectroscopy in chlorobenzene solutions (ca. 10−5 M, Fig. S3). All PSVs display similar Raman scattering profiles. The three major peaks from 1200 to 1600 cm−1 (insert, Fig. S3), which have been previously assigned respectively to vinyl C–H bend, ring CC stretch and vinyl CC stretch, are slightly red-shifted in cross-conjugated PSVs relative to those from PSV-H. This observation is consistent with the structures of cross-conjugated PSVs in which the electron withdrawing bromine atoms and cross-conjugated side-chains all effectively weaken the strengths of these chemical bonds through inductive and delocalization effects.
The optical properties of the PSVs were assessed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy in both dilute chlorobenzene (CB) solutions and as thin films, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2. Compared with PSV-H, PSV-Br and the cross-conjugated PSVs exhibit slightly red-shifted absorption maxima, likely resulted from the electron-withdrawing effect and the enlarged conjugated systems respectively, consistent with Raman scattering observation. For the cross-conjugated PSVs, the absorption signals emerge between 300 and 400 nm, which were assigned to the conjugated side-chains and that of PSV-ThCN is the most prominent at ca. 369 nm due to the cyanoester's strongly electron-withdrawing effect. The main absorption peaks of all PSVs in the red to near-IR regions are structured even in dilute solutions, which become slightly red-shifted and enhanced in thin films. We believe such phenomena are very similar to the case of PTV derivatives, and caused by aggregation effects even in very dilute solutions. Such effect is further confirmed by variable temperature absorption studies as shown in Fig. S4. The vibronic features and intramolecular charge transfer peak of PSV-ThCN all disappear upon heating to 120 °C, which, on the other hand, become more enhanced when the solutions are cooled down to 0 °C. A noticeable difference is that the vibronic features in the absorption peaks from brominated and cross-conjugated PSVs are less pronounced than that from PSV-H, indicating less efficient π–π interactions between polymer chains and reduced main-chain coplanarity in these modified PSVs, which is presumably caused by the steric effects from large side-chains leading to more amorphous polymers and is consistent with 1H NMR observations. The amorphous nature of these PSV polymers are further confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements as no thermal transition could be observed for all polymers except for PSV-Br at reduced scanning rate of 2 °C min−1, revealing only a glass transition temperature (Tg) at ca. 40 °C. All PSVs are relatively low bandgap materials displaying absorptions extending beyond ca. 800 nm in thin films, the bandgaps (Table 1) of which are respectively smaller than similarly functionalized PTV derivatives, confirming the bandgap lowering effects from Se atom substitution. Intriguingly, PSV-ThCN displays a unique low-energy peak beyond 800 nm that is absent in other PSVs and results in a further reduced bandgap at ca. 1.43 eV in solution and ca. 1.39 eV in the solid state. We assign this structure-less low energy peak to main-chain to side-chain intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) electronic transition according to the similar phenomenon observed in cross-conjugated PTV derivatives.
In order to corroborate with the optical properties observed, we performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on thin films of these PSVs in order to estimate their frontier orbital energies, as shown in Fig. S6 and summarized in Table 1. All films showed quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction events, from the onsets of which we can respectively estimate the relative positions of their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). It is clearly seen that the HOMO and LUMO levels of brominated and cross-conjugated PSVs are all significantly lower than those of PSV-H, originating from the inductive and conjugation effects of these side-chains. PSV-ThCN displays the deepest LUMO level as expected from the strongly electron-withdrawing cyanoester groups but surprisingly the highest HOMO level among the modified PSVs, giving rise to the apparent smallest bandgap. This observation is also similar to those from cross-conjugated PTV derivatives.
In addition, we have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations (B3LYP, 6-31G*) on oligomers containing three repeat units of PSV-ThCN with alkyl side-chains replaced with protons, and the results are shown in Fig. S20. From the optimized structure, the main-chain of the oligomer is largely coplanar while the side-chain thiophene rings are all twisted out of plane with an average dihedral angle of 18°, which can potentially prevent close packing between polymer chains, leading to the observed amorphous nature of the polymer. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is delocalized along the main-chain and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is localized on one of the side-chains, confirming the hypothesized main-chain to side-chain charge transfer interactions. Indeed, the simulated UV-vis absorption spectrum displays a low energy peak at 852 nm, corresponding to the HOMO to LUMO excitation, which agrees very well with the absorption spectroscopy measurements discussed earlier.
All PSVs studied here are non-emissive within the detection limit of our fluorescence spectrometer, and we are currently investigating in more detail the excitonic dynamics in these polymers by using ultra-fast transient absorption spectroscopy and will report any findings in future accounts.
Organic solar cell (OSC) devices have attracted significant research interests in recent years as alternative energy sources that possess unique properties including light weight and flexibility when compared with their inorganic counterparts. We have fabricated OSC devices using the newly synthesized PSV polymers as electron donors in combination with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as electron acceptor as the active layers. All devices adopt the basic ITO glass/MoO3 (10 nm)/active layer (100 nm)/Al (80 nm) structures and were optimized by varying the donor/acceptor weight ratios, concentrations, spin coating conditions, and thermal annealing conditions. The results of optimized devices are summarized in Table S1. The open circuit voltage (VOC) values, closely related to the energy differences between the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO levels, are consistent with the HOMO levels of polymers (Table 1), since PSV-Br has the deepest HOMO level of −5.07 eV, leading to the highest VOC of 0.73 V. All devices suffer from relatively low short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) values, leading to the best performing devices employing PSV-Br displaying power conversion efficiency at ca. 1.25%. Such relatively low performance is likely caused by the amorphous nature of these polymers, which can severely limit the conductivity of devices under light irradiation. Thus, our future efforts will be focused on improving polymer crystallinity by imparting regio-regularity and coplanarity of such cross-conjugated PSVs.

In summary, we have developed a facile methodology, by combining ADMET and PPM techniques, to prepare PSV derivatives containing cross-conjugated side-chains. A series of novel PSVs with thiophene-based substituents on selenophene rings along the polymer backbone were synthesized, which offered detailed structure–property relationship studies on these unique polymers for the first time. Our methodology is highly versatile in that differently functionalized cross-conjugated side-chains can be systematically installed to the common polymeric precursor PSV-Br; and is expected to be applicable to other poly(arylene vinylene) polymers containing various heteroarenes, thus opening great opportunities in this relatively less explored field in conjugated polymer synthesis.
