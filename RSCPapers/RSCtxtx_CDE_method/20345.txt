By applying the concept of an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure, we have designed a new linear-conjugation perylene diimide (PDI) derivative Th-4PDI that contains four PDI units connected at different reactive positions. Th-4PDI is constructed via a coupling reaction between two heterologous PDI dimers (2PDI) as the acceptor parts and a thiophene as the donor unit. Th-4PDI possesses a broadened absorption spectrum in the region of 400 to 700 nm and a deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of −4.03 eV. More importantly, the active layer films based on Th-4PDI exhibit a higher charge mobility, more balanced carrier transport and more favorable nanomorphology than those of the prototype 2PDI, which are important factors for achieving high efficiency in organic solar cells (OSCs). As a result, the device based on PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.17%, which is 3 times higher than that of 2PDI. The results demonstrate that constructing A–D–A type conjugated structures based on 2PDI is a feasible strategy to achieve high PCEs in OSCs and also, with a rational design, the heterologous PDI arrays could be developed into high efficiency non-fullerene electron acceptor materials.

Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated compounds have been extensively studied because of their advantages of varied molecular structures and highly tunable physical properties, such as controllable absorption spectra, molecular orbital energy levels, and charge mobilities, which are crucial factors in organic electronics. Especially for organic solar cells (OSCs), different chosen functional D- or A-units and their various combinations could be constructed into compounds that could be used as electron donor or acceptor materials. In recent years, with the development of novel D–A structured materials, including electron donors and acceptors, such as the predominant donors of PTB7-Th, PBDB-T, and their derivatives, and the superstar acceptors of ITIC and its derivatives, OSCs have achieved great success. For instance, Hou et al. recently explored a new donor and acceptor pair, both of which incorporated electron-deficient F-atoms to enhance the inter/intramolecular interactions, obtaining a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the single junction device of over 13%, highlighting the potential commercial applications of OSCs. That is to say, the design of new structured materials is still a key issue for OSCs.

As typical N-type semiconductor materials, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives were used very early as electron acceptors for OSCs. However, due to the strong intermolecular aggregation property, the utilization of planar PDI derivatives as electron acceptor materials was majorly hindered in bulk heterojunction (BH-) OSCs. Fortunately, the twisted PDI derivatives, especially for D–A type structures, could efficiently inhibit strong π-stacking and excimer formation, and they yielded high PCEs in BH-OSCs. Recently, we endeavored to develop a series of single-bond connected PDI arrays for OSCs, which also twist the conjugated planarity and demonstrate some important results: compared with PDI dimer arrays, the corresponding series of trimer ones, owing to higher molar extinction coefficients, higher electron mobilities, and furthermore, the more favorable nanophase separation, realized higher PCE values under the same processing conditions. However, at the same time, we found a new phenomenon but intractable problem that the PCEs of devices based on heterologous PDI arrays are much lower than those of the homologous ones, which is mainly attributed to the low and unbalanced charge mobilities, unfavorable thin film morphology, and exciton quenching effect of the heterologous PDI arrays. From the point of view of molecular design, how to design a molecular system of heterologous PDI derivatives to efficiently inhibit intramolecular charge transfer and realize high charge mobility and favorable blend film nanomorphology for achieving a high efficiency is challenging but urgent. Therefore, we hope, with the feature of the D–A structure that electrons and holes could efficiently transport from the A and D units, respectively, to construct a new D–A modified heterologous PDI type acceptor to realize high PCEs in OSCs.
In this work, an A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptor, namely, Th-4PDI (Scheme 1), was constructed with thiophene as the central bridge and heterologous PDI dimer (2PDI) as the acceptor building blocks. Compared to 2PDI, the new compound Th-4PDI not only exhibits a red-shifted absorption spectrum, a unique property of the D–A conjugated structure, but it also extends the molecular conjugation and leads to a more favorable nanomorphology for high efficiency. As a result, the device based on PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI shows a high PCE of 7.17%, which is 3 times that (2.07%) of 2PDI, which indicates that heterologous PDI arrays can realize high PCEs via constructing a D–A structured PDI derivative for OSCs.

As shown in Scheme 1, Th-4PDI was efficiently synthesized in high yields. The structures of the heterologous PDI dimer 2PDI and the electron donor PTB7-Th are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The thiophene bridge, due to the advantages of the strong electron-rich property with lower aromaticity, extending the conjugated skeleton, and the intermolecular interaction of weak sulfur–sulfur bonds, was previously developed to construct D–A type PDI derivatives between PDI monomers at the bay positions and the device performance improved greatly. Moreover, the longer effective conjugation of the new compound, with four PDIs and one thiophene unit, makes it greatly probable to obtain high charge mobility and favorable morphology of the thin films. With these considerations, herein, we have designed this new A–D–A type compound Th-4PDI. Firstly, we utilized the classical Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to obtain the important intermediate Br-2PDI. Then, through the Stille cross-coupling reaction, we synthesized the compound Th-4PDI as a dark violet solid. The two steps of the synthesis are efficient with high yields. The target compound was fully characterized by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and it exhibits excellent thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (with 5% weight loss) of 395 °C (Fig. S2, ESI).


The ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the compounds in dilute dichoromethane solution (10−5 M) and thin film are shown in Fig. 1. In solution (Fig. 1a), 2PDI shows a narrow band from 400 nm to 600 nm, while Th-4PDI shows a red-shifted absorption band in the range of 400 to 700 nm. Compared with 2PDI, Th-4PDI has a weak and broad absorption in the wavelength range of 550–700 nm, which is attributed to the increase of the conjugation skeleton owing to the introduction of the thiophene to construct the A–D–A system of the molecule. In addition, the two compounds exhibit strong absorption in the visible region at the same maximum absorption peak of 529 nm with the high maximum molar extinction coefficients of 9.3 × 104 and 8.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for 2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively. In thin film (Fig. 1b), the two compounds show broadened absoption spectra and have about a 5 nm red shift from solution to solid film. In addition, the donor polymer PTB7-Th strongly absorbs in the wavelength range from 550 to 750 nm, which is well matched with the acceptors and will enhance light harvesting in the range of the solar spectrum.


Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties (Fig. 2). The compounds 2PDI and Th-4PDI exhibit five and three reversible reduction waves in dichloromethane, which are beneficial to accept more electrons when generating charge, and no oxidation waves were detected (Fig. 2a). From the onset reduction potentials, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated to be −4.01 and −4.03 eV for 2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively. The similar LUMO levels are attributed to the maintained complete planarity property of the ortho-connected PDI derivatives. Due to the red shift of the absorption spectrum, the optical band gap (Eg) (1.94 eV) of Th-4PDI is smaller than that (2.21 eV) of 2PDI. Combined with the LUMO levels, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels could be estimated to be −6.22 and −5.97 eV for 2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively. At the same time, PTB7-Th, the electron donor material used in the OSC devices, has well matched electronic energy levels with the LUMO value of −3.64 eV and the HOMO value of −5.22 eV. All the electronic energy levels could be clearly illustrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP functional and a 6-31G(d,p) basis set. From the optimized ground-state geometries (Fig. 2b), their LUMO electron densities mainly distribute on the ortho-connected PDI units, while the HOMO ones are mainly located on the bay-connected PDI unit and thiophene bay-connected PDI unit for 2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively, which demonstrates the similar LUMO levels and different HOMO levels. The calculated LUMO levels of −3.85 and −3.86 eV, and HOMO levels of −6.12 and −5.95 eV for 2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively, were calculated using DFT, which are consistent with the experimental data.


In order to estimate the photovoltaic properties, non-fullerene OSCs were fabricated with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI or 2PDI/MoO3/Al, where ITO was indium tin oxide, and ZnO and MoO3 were used as the n- and p-type interfacial layers, respectively, to facilitate charge transport and collection. PTB7-Th, which has complementary absorption with the electron acceptors and well matched energy levels, was chosen as the electron donor. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the photovoltaic performance data are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. Firstly, controlling the varying donor/acceptor mass ratio from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5, the devices were initially tested. Obviously, the optimal D/A weight ratio is 1:1, and the optimum PCE of the Th-4PDI- based device reaches 5.42% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.765 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 13.49 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 52.5%.

Then, some solvent additives such as chloronaphthalene (CN), diphenyl ether (DPE), and 1,8-diodooctane (DIO) were used for the optimal devices with the optimal D/A weight ratio of 1:1, and the details of the device optimization processes are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). All solvent additives could improve the PCEs of the devices, but when utilizing 1% DIO as the processing additive, the device gives the best photovoltaic performance. Besides the improved VOC and FF, JSC has a big increase from 13.49 to 16.75 mA cm−2, and therefore the device exhibits the best PCE of 7.17% (over 20 independent devices). Under the same conditions, the devices based on 2PDI were taken for comparison and only gave an inferior performance with a PCE of about 2%, which is much lower than that of the Th-4PDI-based OSCs. The main reason is the lower current density of the device, which corresponds to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Fig. 3b). Both devices exhibited broad EQE spectra from 300 to 800 nm, which correspond to the absorption spectra of blend films (Fig. S3, ESI). For the Th-4PDI-based device with 1% DIO, the EQE values in the wavelength range of 500–700 nm were observed to be higher than 60% and the maximum value was about 75%, indicating efficient photon harvesting and charge collection. The JSC value calculated from the EQE spectrum was 16.14 mA cm−2, which is in agreement with the current obtained from the J–V measurement.

The photoluminescence (PL) quenching of the thin blend films was measured to determine the percentage of excimers that can reach and dissociate at the donor/acceptor interface (Fig. 4a). The fluorescence quenching values of PTB7-Th of 91.5% and 92.9% were obtained for the blend films based on 2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively, which indicates that the non-radiant electron transfer occurs efficiently at the interfaces of the donors and the acceptors and therefore the OSC devices could generate a high JSC.

To further investigate the carrier transport properties, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole and electron mobilities with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. In the pure film SCLC electron-only devices (Fig. 4b), Th-4PDI gives a higher electron mobility of 3.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that (2.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of 2PDI. In their blend film SCLC devices (Fig. 4c), similar high hole mobilities of 1.47 × 10−4 and 1.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for PTB7-Th:2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively.
In their electron-only devices, the relatively low electron mobilities of 1.69 × 10−5 and 3.17 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for PTB7-Th:2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively. All these results indicate that Th-4PDI has the higher carrier mobility and the more balanced charge transport, which can explain the enhanced JSC and FF in the OSC devices.

To better understand the charge recombination processes of the OSCs based on the blend films, light-intensity-dependent characteristics were studied. Exciton generation rates and the charge collection probabilities (PC, determined by the normalized Jph at the saturated current density) were revealed by using plots of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) at JSC conditions, as shown in Fig. 5a. The resulting PC was determined to be 85.1% and 92.9% for PTB7-Th:2PDI and PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI blend films with the corresponding best beneficial additives, respectively. The higher PC value of 92.9% is consistent with the superior photovoltaic performance. The light intensity (P) dependences of JSC were also measured to investigate nongeminate recombination losses of the devices. The relationship between JSC and light intensity followed the relation JSC ∝ PS. The S values were calculated to be 0.89 and 0.94, respectively, from the JSC–P curves in Fig. 5b for the PTB7-Th:2PDI and PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI blend films. The higher value of 0.94 for the device based on Th-4PDI indicated that the bimolecular recombination was negligible in the device, which is superior to the other device. All these data suggest that the device based on Th-4PDI exhibited less charge-trapped recombination, which was consistent with the higher JSC in the OSCs, and therefore improving the photovoltaic properties.


To gain insight into the morphology of the active films, tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed. As shown in Fig. 6, the AFM image of the PTB7-Th:2PDI blend film suggests a well-mixed state of the donor and acceptor components at the mesoscopic length scale with a root-mean-square (RMS) of 1.23 nm, while the blend film of PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI gives a decreased rough surface with a smaller RMS of 0.77 nm, which indicates that the blend film based on Th-4PDI tends to segregate into smaller domains and there is a better mixing of the donor and acceptor components. Also, the TEM image of Th-4PDI exhibits an obvious fibrillar structure and no large-size aggregation was observed, which is similar to the results of the AFM images. All these results shed light on the optimum electron mobility of the blend film of PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI in the SCLC characterization experiments and agree well with the increased FF and JSC observed and therefore the higher PCE of the PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI devices.


In summary, using a D–A structure, we have designed and synthesized a new linear-conjugation PDI electron acceptor, containing one thiophene as the donor unit and four PDI monomers as the acceptor building blocks, to demonstrate that heterologous PDI derivatives can realize high efficiency in non-fullerene OSCs. Because of the D–A effect, Th-4PDI gives an additional tail peak in the region of 600–700 nm and broadens the absorption spectra, which is beneficial for more effective utilization of the sunlight spectrum and therefore improving the efficiency of the OSCs. The CV spectra give similar LUMO levels of −4.01 and −4.03 eV for 2PDI and Th-4PDI, respectively, which is attributed to the same LUMO electron densities distributing on the ortho-connected PDI unit. Compared with that of PTB7-Th:2PDI, the thin film of PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI exhibits a higher electron mobility, more balanced charge transport and favorable morphology. Importantly, Th-4PDI could efficiently transfer excitons from the thiophene unit and therefore improve the efficiency of the exciton separation. As a result, the device based on PTB7-Th:Th-4PDI gives the best PCE of 7.17%, which is three times that (2.07%) based on 2PDI. These observations demonstrate that constructing a D–A structure is an effective and facile method to modify heterologous PDI arrays for improving the efficiency of non-fullerene OSCs.

For the OSC devices, ITO glass plates were cleaned in a sonication bath in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water sequentially, dried by blowing nitrogen, and then treated with O2 plasma for 15 min before use. About a 25 nm thick ITO-modifying layer of ZnO was spin-coated on top of ITO and then baked for 30 min at 200 °C. Then, the PTB7-Th:2PDI (or Th-4PDI) blend liquid was spin-coated on the ZnO layer to get about an 85 nm thick film. Finally, MoO3 and Al layers were evaporated on top of the active layer. The device area, the overlap section between the ITO and Al electrodes, was 7 mm2. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit under illumination of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator (Newport USA, Model: 94023A) with an AM 1.5 filter in ambient air. The IPCE characterization of all devices was performed in ambient air by using a Hypermono-light (SM-25, Jasco Co. Ltd, Japan). A calibrated Si photodiode (818-UV Newport) was used as a reference in order to determine the intensity of the light incident on the device, allowing the IPCE spectrum to be deduced.

For the SCLC devices, we used the device architectures of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al for the electron-only and hole-only devices, respectively. The ITO glass plates with 15 Ω cm−2 resistance were cleaned and then treated with O2 plasma for 15 min before use. A thin layer of ZnO (∼25 nm) or PEDOT:PSS (∼45 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO glasses and then transferred into a glove box immediately. Active layers were spin-coated using the prepared solutions at 1000 rpm for 30 seconds in a glove box, and the thickness was about 300 nm. After that, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum thermal evaporator, followed by deposition of the Ca/Al (10 nm/100 nm) or MoO3/Al (10 nm/100 nm) cathode at a base pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. All SCLC devices were characterized with a computer-controlled Keithley 2420 source-measure unit.
