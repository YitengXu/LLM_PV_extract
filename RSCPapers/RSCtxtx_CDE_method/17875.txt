Electron-accepting solution-processable conjugated polymers consisting of perylene diimide moieties alternating with dithienothiophene, oligo(dithienothiophene), or N-dodecyl dithienopyrrole units have been synthesized. All these polymers possess excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures over 400 °C. The glass-transition temperatures vary from 155 to 263 °C. These polymers show broad absorption extending from 250 to 900 nm with electrochemical and optical bandgaps as low as 1.4 eV; the maximum absorbance increases and the bandgap decreases with increasing the conjugation length of oligo(dithienothiophene), while the bandgap can also be decreased by the replacement of dithienothiophene by dithienopyrrole. The electrochemical onset reduction potentials range from −0.8 to −1.0 V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene, suggesting that the electron affinities are essentially unaffected by the specific choice of donor moiety, while the onset oxidation potentials (+0.6 to +1.0 V) are a little more sensitive to the choice of donor. The mono dithienothiophene and the dithienopyrrole polymers were found to exhibit electron mobilities as high as 1.3 × 10−2 and 1.2 × 10−3 cm2V−1s−1, respectively, in top-contact organic field-effect transistors. Power conversion efficiencies in the range 0.77–1.1% were obtained under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW/cm2 irradiation for all-polymer solar cells using the dithienothiophene-based polymers as acceptors in a 1 : 1 ratio with a polythiophene derivative as a donor. The device performance varies with the conjugation length of oligo(dithienothiophene) in the polymer acceptors, and for the best-performing material it can be further optimized to give a power conversion efficiency of 1.5% by increasing the donor/acceptor weight ratio to 3 : 1.

Organic solar cells have attracted considerable attention due to their potential for use in low-cost, light-weight, and flexible large-area panels. So far, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) for polymer solar cells (PSC) is 6.5%, still far below the 10% that is often regarded as being a prerequisite for large-scale commercial applications. The synthesis of new conjugated polymers with smaller bandgaps, wider bandwidths, optimized energy levels, and higher carrier mobilities will be the key to allowing plastic solar cells to become a viable energy source for this century.

Although fullerenes, particularly the solution-processable derivative known as PCBM, are the most commonly used acceptors in organic solar cells, due to their good electron-accepting and electron-transporting properties, conjugated polymer acceptor materials have recently attracted interest as alternative electron-transport materials. However, the PCE of the devices has been low relative to that of polymer/fullerene solar cells. To date, the highest PCE of an all-polymer PSC was 1% without thermal annealing; it was further improved to 1.5–1.8% with optimized device structure and fabrication conditions especially thermal annealing. One of the reasons for low efficiency of the all-polymer PSCs is presumably a lack of good polymer acceptors with high electron affinity, high electron mobility, and good sunlight-harvesting properties.
Perylene diimides (PDI) represent a class of electron-transport materials with comparable electron affinities to fullerenes and, in some cases, excellent electron mobilities. In addition, they have excellent chemical, thermal, and photochemical stabilities. PDI small molecules are widely used in organic photovoltaic cells. However, there have been few reports on the application of PDI polymers in PSCs. Janssen and coworkers reported donor–acceptor polymers, consisting of alternating PDI and oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) units connected via saturated spacers, for solar cells. Zhu and coworkers also reported copolymers containing PDI and OPV or triphenylamine moieties, connected through ether linkages at the 1,7 “bay” positions of PDI, for photovoltaic applications. However, the device performance of these two examples was poor.
The planarity and S⋯S interaction of fused thiophenes have been found to promote highly-ordered π-stacked structures and high hole mobilities. Recently, we synthesized a polymer acceptor (1, Fig. 1) based on alternating dithienothiophene (DTT) and PDI units. The presence of the planar dithienothiophene units may benefit an ordered structure, while the donor–acceptor character of the polymer suggests the possibility of low-energy charge-transfer transitions, potentially leading to increasing coverage of the solar spectrum. The polymer was found to exhibit high electron mobility (1.3 × 10−2 cm2V−1s−1 according to field-effect transistor measurements), high electron affinity (estimated as 3.9 eV from electrochemical measurements), and broad absorption ranging from 250 to 850 nm. A power conversion efficiency of over 1%, under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW/cm2, was measured for all-polymer PSCs using this polymer as acceptor and a bis(thienylenevinylene)-substituted polythiophene (5, Fig. 1) as a donor. More recently we have also reported a study of PSCs based on a related donor (6) and a related acceptor containing two DTT units between each PDI (2): we found that by optimizing the ratio of 2 : 6 (Fig. 1) a PCE as high as 1.5% could be obtained. In this paper, we report more fully on the synthesis of polymers 2 and 6, as well as new polymers 3, containing three DTT units, and 4, with a N-substituted dithienopyrrole (DTP) in place of the DTT of polymer 1. DTPs have recently been incorporated into a range of conjugated polymers; compared to DTTs they are more electron rich and also offer the possibility of tuning the polymer solubility and ordering through the N-substituents without disrupting the polymer backbone. We compare the effects of increasing the number of DTT units and of replacing DTT with a DTP unit on the electronic properties of the polymers. We also compare the PSC performance of 1–3 used in conjunction with 6 as a donor. We also compare n-channel field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 1 and 4.

The synthesis of polymer 1 was reported in our previous paper. Synthetic routes to the polymers 2–4 are shown in Scheme 1. Monomer II was synthesized by Stille coupling of the N,N′-dialkyl-1,7-dibromo-3,4:9,10-perylene diimide with a monostannyl derivative of dithienothiophene, followed by bromination. Polymer 2 was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed homocoupling of the dibromide II in the presence of hexabutylditin. Stille coupling of II with a distannyl dithienothiophene derivative afforded polymer 3. Polymer 4 was synthesized in a similar manner to 1, i.e., by the Stille coupling of the dibromo-perylene diimide derivative with a distannyl derivative of N-n-dodecyldithienopyrrole. As in our previous synthesis of a distannylated N-aryl DTP, the appropriate distannyl precursor was obtained by lithiation of the parent N-dodecyl DTP, following by treatment with nBu3SnCl; it has previously been reported that the related compound 2,6-di(tri-n-butylstannyl)-N-n-octyl-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole could not be isolated pure due to its instability; however, it was possible to obtain both the present compound and an N-aryl analogue analytically pure after silica gel chromatography. Polymer 6 was synthesized by Wittig–Horner olefination, followed by Stille coupling (Scheme 2). All the polymers have good solution processability and are soluble in chloroform, THF, and chlorobenzene. The molecular weights of these polymers were estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards as calibrants and are listed in Table 1. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of the polymers 1–3 are in the range 15000–43000 with polydispersity indices (Mw/Mn) of 1.5–2.2; the measured Mw for polymer 4 was somewhat lower (8000).

The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Table 1, the polymers 1–3 possess excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) (5% weight loss) over 400 °C. The glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of 1–3 range from 215 to 263 °C. The DSC data suggest that the Tgs and therefore, morphological stability of the polymers increase with the number of DTT units. While 4 appears to show a similar thermal stability to its DTT analogues, the glass transition temperature is significantly lower, with the low molecular weight and the long N-alkyl substituents perhaps contributing to this observation.

A critical factor for improving the efficiency of photovoltaic devices is to match the absorption spectra of the photovoltaic materials with the solar spectrum which extends from <350 to >1500 nm with a maximum photon flux around 700 nm. Thus, conjugated polymers with broad absorption bandwidths, in addition to narrow bandgaps, are desirable for PSCs. However, such organic materials, especially electron acceptors, are scarce.

UV absorption spectra of the polymers 1–4 in chloroform are shown in Fig. 2(a). All the polymers exhibit 3–4 absorption maxima. In all cases, the highest energy maxima are observed at ca. 309–330 nm. In the case of 1 and 4, these maxima appear as shoulders of bands at ca. 350 and ca. 370 nm, respectively. In addition, compounds 1 and 4 exhibit considerably intense bands at ca. 480 nm and low-energy bands at 619 and 726 nm, respectively. Overall, the spectra of 1 and 4 are reminiscent of those of PDIs with oligothiophenyl, DTT,p-(diphenylamino)phenyl, and p-(amino)phenylethynyl groups in the 1,7 positions. These similarities suggest that the band at ca. 350–370 nm can be assigned to a DTT/DTP-centered transition, the 480 nm band to a principally PDI-based transition, and the low-energy band to a transition with significant DTT/DTP-to-PDI charge-transfer character. The significant red-shift in the low-energy band seen on replacing DTT with DTP is consistent with a charge-transfer-type assignment given the more electron-rich character of DTP vs. DTT. In the case of 2 and 3 the transition assigned to the donor is successively red-shifted, overlapping with the PDI-based transition in 3, as is the low-energy band assigned to charge-transfer, consistent with raising the HOMO on inclusion of additional donor groups.
UV absorption spectra of the polymers 1–3 in thin films are shown in Fig. 2(b). The absorption bands in films extend from 250 to 900 nm, similar to those in solutions. The UV-vis spectra of thin films of 1–3 show absorption throughout the visible region; indeed, the films appear black to the eye. Moreover, there is significant absorption extending into the near-IR region (as far as ca. 900 nm, equivalent to optical band gaps as low as ca. 1.5 eV), i.e., to a considerably lower energy than those of cyano-substituted poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (CN-PPVs, <600 nm), which have been widely used as polymer electron acceptors in photovoltaics. The maximum absorption coefficient of the polymers in films increases with DTT number.

A high electron affinity (EA) of the acceptor polymer is essential for efficient photoinduced charge-transfer/separation in donor/acceptor polymer heterojunctions, while an excessively high EA can reduce the open-circuit voltage. To estimate the electron affinities and ionization potentials of the polymers, we studied electrochemical properties using cyclic voltammetry of films drop cast onto glassy carbon working electrodes; an example of a cyclic voltammogram is illustrated in Fig. 3. 3 shows one quasi-reversible oxidation peak and two quasi-reversible reduction peaks. The estimated EAs for 1–4 (3.8–4.0 eV, Table 2) are somewhat higher than that estimated for the polymer acceptor CN-PPV (3.20 eV) using a similar method.

The estimated EAs are relatively insensitive to the number of DTT units. However, the estimated ionization potentials (IPs) decrease suggesting that the bandgap decreases with increasing the number of DTT units, which is consistent with the optical data, while the DTP derivative, 4, is more readily oxidized than its DTT analogue, 1, consistent with previous reports of the relative electron richness of DTT and DTP derivatives.

For use in organic electronic devices it is important to know whether the polymers function as hole- and/or electron-transport materials, with high charge-carrier mobilities being essential for efficient devices. The carrier mobilities of 1 and 4 have been examined in field-effect transistors in which octadecyltrichlorosilane-treated SiO2 was used a gate dielectric and Al was used for top-contact source and drain electrodes. Both materials were found to function as electron-transport materials in n-channel transistors under these conditions. As we have previously described, polymer 1 functions as an electron-transport material, with a saturation electron mobility of 1.3 × 10−2 cm2V−1s−1 in a device with a channel width and length of 1000 µm and 100 µm, respectively. This is a very high value for a solution-processable material. Analogous devices incorporating 4 as the active layer were fabricated and yielded an electron mobility of 7.4 × 10−4 cm2V−1s−1, which increased to 1.2 × 10−3 cm2V−1s−1 on annealing at 100 °C for 60 min under an inert atmosphere (see Fig. 4). The lower mobility observed for 4 may be related to a dilution of the electron-transporting PDI units by the presence of the additional N-substituents of the DTP donors, or due to the disruption of PDI–PDI interactions due to these groups. The threshold voltages for these devices (7.1 and 8.6 V before and after annealing, respectively) were higher than that for comparable devices based on 1 (4.4 V). The on/off current ratios for these devices (>103) were lower than that for comparable devices based on 1 (>104). Devices in which 4 was used, with the lower work-function metal Ca as source and drain electrodes, were also fabricated and yielded mobility values identical to those measured in devices with Al electrodes.


All-polymer PSCs were fabricated using blends of 1–3/6 (1 : 1, w/w). As shown in Fig. 5, the estimated LUMO level of the donor 6 is 0.9–1.1 eV higher than that of acceptors 1–3, while the estimated HOMO level of the donor 6 is 0.4–0.8 eV higher than that of acceptors 1–3, indicating that the energy level positions of the donor and acceptor are appropriately aligned for thermodynamically favorable charge separation at the interface between these two polymers. Indeed, we have previously found that the fluorescence of 6 is completely quenched in films of blends with 2 at a variety of ratios, consistent with efficient charge-transfer from photoexcited 6 to 2.


Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of thin films composed of blends of 1–3 with 6 (1 : 1, w/w); comparison of the thin film spectra of 6 (also shown in Fig. 6) and of 1–3 (Fig. 2b) indicates that these blends can be understood as the sum of the spectra of the constituent parts. Specifically, all the blends show a broad absorption throughout the visible and extending into the near-IR region (to ca. 800 nm), although the absorbance in the range 600–800 nm is relatively weak and the dominant absorption band is in the range 350–600 nm. The maximum absorption coefficient of the blends increases with DTT number, consistent with that of the neat polymer acceptors.
The all-polymer solar cells were characterized by spectrally resolved measurements of the incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) and by the current–voltage characteristics under simulated white light illumination at AM 1.5, 100 mW/cm2. The IPCE curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 7. The blends exhibit broad photoresponses extending up to 700 nm with maxima of 20–27% at 520–540 nm; the IPCE of the 2/6 device is the highest among all the devices. For all devices based on the blends of 6 with 1–3, the IPCE curves show a main peak at ca. 520–540 nm with a shoulder at ca. 430–500 nm. The relative insensitivity of the shape of the IPCE curve to the acceptor suggests that excitation of the donor is the dominant contributor to the photocurrent conversion of the devices, although the shoulder, and the slight variation in responses between devices with different PDI-based polymers, may suggest some contribution from the acceptor as well. This observation is consistent with our previous report of a relatively short excited-state lifetime for 1 and with our finding that intramolecular charge-transfer-type behavior in small-molecule perylene diimide derivatives hampers intermoleculer charge separation.

Fig. 8 shows the current density (J) versus voltage (V) curves of the PSCs under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 at 100 mW/cm2. The open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices are summarized in Table 3. The Voc (0.67–0.69 V) and FF (0.40–0.43) of the devices change only a little with the acceptors. The similarity in Voc values is consistent with the negligible variation in acceptor EAs (see above), since the energy difference between the IP of donor and EA of acceptor is an important factor affecting this parameter. However, the Jsc and PCE of the devices are dependent on the acceptors in the active blend layers. Jsc and PCE follow the sequence: 2 > 1 > 3, consistent with the IPCE trend. The PSC device based on the 2/6 blend exhibits the best performance; Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE reach 0.67 V, 3.71 mA/cm2, 0.43 and 1.08%, respectively. The optimized device with 6 and 2 in the ratio 3 : 1 (w/w) without thermal annealing gives a Jsc of 5.02 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 1.5%, under simulated AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. These values are among the highest reported for all-polymer PSCs.

We have shown that electron-accepting and transporting polymers with good solution processability, excellent thermal stability, and high electron affinities can be obtained based on the copolymerization of perylene diimide and oligo(dithienothiophene) or N-dodecyl dithienopyrrole building blocks. These polymers show broad absorption spectra extending into the near-IR, the details of which can be varied either by increasing the number of DTT units in the repeat unit of the polymer or by replacing DTT with the stronger donor, DTP. Increasing the number of DTT units, or replacing DTT with DTP, leads to more facile oxidation (lower IP), but affects the ease of reduction (EA) to a lesser extent, suggesting that the LUMOs are strongly PDI-localized. FET measurements on two of these materials show n-channel behavior, with one of the polymers showing one of the highest electron mobilities reported for a solution-processable material. The electron-transport properties of these polymers can also be exploited in bulk-heterojunction all-polymer solar cells in combination with a polythiophene-based donor; these devices show good power conversion efficiencies, as high as 1.5% under simulated AM 1.5.


Unless stated otherwise, starting materials were obtained from Aldrich or Acros and were used without further purification. N,N′-Bis(2-decyl-tetradecyl)-1,7-dibromo-3,4:9,10-perylene diimide, 2,6-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]-thiophene, 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene,N-(n-dodecyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole, and (E,E)-2-(5-formyl-2-thienylvinyl)-5-(5-butyl-2-thienylvinyl)-thiophene were prepared according to the published procedures.


The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Varian Mercury 300 MHz or a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer using MALDI mode or on a GCT-MS micromass spectrometer using the electron impact (EI) mode. Elemental analyses were carried out by Atlantic Microlabs using a LECO 932 CHNS elemental analyzer or on a FLASH EA1112 elemental analyzer. Solution (chloroform) and thin film (on quartz substrate) UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on JASCO V-570 and CARY 5E spectrometers. The film thicknesses necessary to determine the absorption coefficients were measured by Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out under nitrogen on a deoxygenated solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in acetonitrile using a computer-controlled BAS 100B electrochemical analyzer, a glassy-carbon working electrode coated with polymer films, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and a Ag wire anodized with AgCl as a pseudo-reference electrode. Potentials were referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene (FeCp2+/0) couple by using ferrocene as an internal standard. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (model TGA-50) under a nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on Shimadzu differential scanning calorimeter (model DSC-50) under a nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity indices (defined as Mw/Mn) of the polymers were estimated on a PL-GPC Model 210 chromatograph at 35 °C, using THF as eluent and polystyrene standards as calibrants.


The PSCs were fabricated in the traditional sandwich structure. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated from an aqueous solution (Bayer AG) on a pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate, and was dried subsequently at 150 °C in air for 10 min, giving a thickness of ca. 30 nm as measured by a Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer. The photosensitive blend layers were prepared by spin-coating a chlorobenzene solution containing both 1, 2, or 3 and 6 with the polymer total concentration of 18 mg/mL on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode, followed by drying at 80 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the active layer is about 60 nm. Finally, the cathode consisting of 10 nm of calcium and 150 nm of aluminium, was thermally deposited on the top of the polymer film at 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of one cell was 4 mm2. These experiments were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box.

The current–voltage (I–V) measurements of the devices were conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A Xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the white light source, and the optical power on the sample was 100 mW/cm2. The incident photon-to-converted current efficiency (IPCE) was recorded by Stanford Research Systems Model SR830 DSP Lock-in Amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and 500 W Xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

Top-contact OFETs were fabricated on n-doped silicon substrates (also serving as the gate electrode) using thermally grown SiO2 (200 nm) as the gate dielectric insulator. The backside of the substrates was coated with Ti/Au (20 nm/100 nm) as the external gate contact.

Octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was used as a self-assembled surface modifier for SiO2. The substrates were oxygen-plasma treated for five min immediately followed by dipping in a 5 mM of OTS in toluene overnight in a N2-filled glove box to grow a self-assembled monolayer (SAM).
The semiconductor films were spin-coated on top of the OTS-treated SiO2 from a 10 mg/mL chloroform solution of 4. The source and drain electrodes (150 nm) using aluminium or calcium were evaporated through a shadow mask under high vacuum level below 10−7 Torr.
The samples were transferred in a vacuum tight vessel without being exposed to atmospheric conditions into a nitrogen glove box (O2, H2O < 1 ppm) for electrical testing. The electrical measurements were performed using an Agilent E5272A source/monitor unit. The samples were tested before and after annealing at 100 °C for 60 min followed by rapid cooling. The electrical parameters, i.e. mobility, threshold voltage, and on/off current ratio, were extracted from the saturation region using the square-law model based on metal-oxide-field-effect-transistors.

To a 100 mL three-neck round-bottomed flask were added N,N′-bis(2-decyl-tetradecyl)-1,7-dibromo-3,4:9,10-perylene diimide (1.32 mmol, 1.6 g), 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)-(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene) (4.0 mmol, 1.92 g), and dry toluene (40 mL); the mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (80 µmol, 93 mg) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated up to 90 °C to give a red solution. After stirring at 90 °C for 2 days, the resulting black solution was cooled down to room temperature. A solution of KF (5 g) in water (10 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h to remove the tin side products. The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 100 mL), washed with water (2 × 250 mL), and dried over anhydrous MgSO4.
