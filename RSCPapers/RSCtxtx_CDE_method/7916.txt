Novel SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials have been designed and synthesized by in situ coating a layer of TiO2 on the surface of the SnO2 nanorods using a modified flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) approach. The as-prepared SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials have a length of up to about 150 nm and a diameter of about 40 nm. TiO2 is uniformly coated on well-crystallized SnO2 nanorods with a thickness of about 10 nm. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) properties of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials were investigated. Owing to the superior light scattering effect, advantages of suppression charge recombination, and increased dye loading, the power conversion efficiency (η) of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid material electrode is 6.98%, much higher than that of the SnO2 nanorods electrode (3.95%) and P25 electrode (5.27%).

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), with the benefits of being environmentally friendly, of low-cost, and having a facile fabrication process, have attracted great attention as an excellent source of future green energy. Since the first great effort on DSCs by Grätzel, much work has been done to improve their efficiency. Conventional DSC photoelectrodes are fabricated using films of TiO2 nanoparticles, which have a high surface area for dye loading, resulting in an outstanding power conversion efficiency. However, a major weakness of the conventional TiO2 nanoparticles photoelectrode in DSCs is the slow electron transport speed. This drawback can be overcome by using 1-D nanostructured metal oxides (TiO2, SnO2, ZnO2 (ref. 7)) in the film, such as nanotubes, nanorods and nanowires. For instance, the electron lifetime in films using nanorods or nanotubes can be enhanced by almost 3 times to that in nanoparticle films.

SnO2 is a highly favourable material for applications in DSCs. Compared to TiO2, it has two advantages. Firstly, SnO2 exhibits a band gap of 3.8 eV, much larger than that of TiO2 (3.2 eV). Furthermore it generates much fewer oxidative holes under illumination, therefore improving the long-term stability of the DSCs and minimizing the degradation rate of the dye. Secondly, electron mobility in SnO2 is much faster than in TiO2. Therefore, developing 1-D structured SnO2 in DSCs is a hot topic in the DSCs field nowadays. S. Ramakrishna et al. used nanoflower-shaped SnO2 in DSCs with no further post-treatment, and achieved an energy conversion efficiency of about 3%. W. Tremel et al. reported that the use of tunable anisotropic SnO2 nanocrystals could improve the power conversion efficiency of DSCs to up to 3% without any TiCl4 post-treatment. Nonetheless, the DSCs based on 1-D SnO2 show inferior energy conversion efficiency (about 3–4%) compared to recent examples based on TiO2. The weak photovoltaic properties of DSCs based on SnO2 are attributed to the poor dye loading capacity and the fast charge carrier recombination. These shortcomings have been partly overcome by coating the SnO2 with a barrier layer using metal oxides, for example ZnO, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO and Al2O3. They have been widely used to enhance the efficiencies of SnO2-based DSCs (4–6.5%) along with a titanium tetrachloride post-treatment. Li et al. synthesized Mg-doped SnO2 with a TiO2 coating layer, and obtained a highest power conversion efficiency of 4.15%. Ducati et al. investigated the influence of coating the SnO2 surface with MgO and TiO2, and achieved good DSC performance. Desai et al. used ZnO nanowires as a sacrificial template and synthesized hybrid TiO2–SnO2 nanotube arrays, with the best performance of their cells being 3.53%. Considerable attention has been focused on 1D core–shell structures for the purpose of speeding up electron transport and slowing electron recombination to achieve a high charge collection efficiency.
Many different approaches, such as the hydrothermal method, chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, have been applied to prepare 1D core–shell structured metal oxides. Conventional approaches for the synthesis of semiconductor oxide materials usually suffer from the need for complicated processes and low yield. Due to the advantages of low cost, being a continuous process, lack of a post-treatment and so on, flame synthesis is becoming a promising way to routinely produce a series of semiconductor oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2. A variety of nanostructured semiconductor oxides with different morphologies have been prepared (e.g., SnO2 1-D nanowires, SnO2/TiO2 hybrid material, TiO2@SiO2 nanospheres). Rutile TiO2 particles coated with SiO2 layers were made in a single step in a modified flame reactor. The in situ coating was achieved via a hollow metal ring delivering hexamethyl disiloxane vapor through multiple pores in a swirl cross-flow to a freshly synthesized TiO2 aerosol. Well-crystalline SnO2 nanorods were obtained using a scalable and continuous iron-assisted flame method with a high yield of 50 g h−1 by Liu et al.
In this work, SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials were designed and prepared using a modified FSP approach. A coating of TiO2 was applied by simply introducing the appropriate amount of TiCl4 vapor above the flame in which the SnO2 nanorods were formed. The DSC properties of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials were investigated.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. A modified FSP reactor was applied to synthesize the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials. As described in detail elsewhere, a FSP reactor was encircled by a long stainless steel metal tube with a diameter of 5 cm. A metal torus pipe ring (D = 10 mm) was positioned right above the nozzle at a distance of 40 cm for applying the TiO2 coating. 16 openings (D = 1 mm) were uniformly distributed on the ring, 20° from the up-centerline.

Briefly, the liquid precursor for the SnO2 nanorods was obtained by dissolving SnCl4·5H2O and FeCl3·6H2O in ethanol with a mole ratio of 20:1. The total metal salt concentration was fixed at 0.5 M. The resulting precursor solution was fed into the central capillary at a flow rate of 5 mL min−1, and dispersed into a fine spray by the gas-assisted nozzle. The flow rate of the dispersed oxygen was 300 L h−1, and the gas pressure at the nozzle tip was modified to be 1.5 bar. Then the spray was evaporated and ignited via a supported diffusion H2/O2 flame (H2: 760 L h−1, O2: 1500 L h−1). The H2 flowed through 8 symmetrical pores (D = 1 mm) surrounding the spray nozzle.
The TiCl4 vapor was provided by bubbling 100 L h−1 N2 through a 500 cm3 glass flask with 100 mL liquid TiCl4 at a temperature of 30 °C. The TiCl4 vapor carried with N2 was injected with an additional 500 L h−1 N2 into the reaction room through the openings of the ring. The TiCl4 molecules reacted with H2O molecules generated from the combustion of H2 and ethanol, and hydrolyzed into TiO2. Subsequently, the TiO2 coated on the SnO2 nanorods formed at a high temperature of about 500 °C, which was supplied by the flame. The products were collected on a filter membrane of glass filters, with the assistance of a vacuum pump. The theoretical yield of our experiment was about 45 g h−1. The flow rates of all of the gases were controlled by calibrated rotameters. All the reagents were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China.
The amount of TiCl4 vapor can be calculated approximately by the saturated vapor pressure, supposing the TiCl4 vapor was saturated. The saturation partial pressure of TiCl4 vapor can be calculated by log10 (P) = 4.84969 − (1990.235/(T−1 + 2)), in which P is the saturation partial pressure of the TiCl4 vapor and T is the temperature of the glass flask (303 K). The velocity of the TiCl4 vapor supplied was calculated to be about 0.28 mol h−1, indicating that the molar ratio of Sn/Ti was about 1:2.

To prepare the DSC photoelectrodes, a slurry was first prepared by mixing 1.0 g SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 with 0.1 g PEG 20000, 1.0 mL terpinol, 0.2 mL acetylacetone and 0.2 g ethyl cellulose. The slurry was coated on FTO glasses (15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) by a doctor-blade approach; beforehand the FTO was treated with 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C. The P25 and SnO2 nanorods films were prepared by the same process. Then the films were calcined in air for 30 min at 450 °C. To obtain a double-layer film, a SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 layer was printed on the P25 film and then calcined in air for 30 min at 450 °C. Then 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution was used to treat the films for 30 min at 70 °C, which were then washed with water and anhydrous ethanol. At last, the films were annealed for 30 min at 450 °C. The film thickness was modified to be nearly 12 μm, and the active area was 0.25 cm2.

An ethanol solution containing 0.5 mM Ru dye (N719, Solaronix) was used for the uptake of the dyes. The resulting films were soaked in the solution at room temperature for 24 h. The counter electrode was fabricated by spin coating 0.50 mM H2PtCl6 solution on the FTO glass, which was followed by calcining in air for 20 min at 380 °C. Then the as-prepared dye-sensitized electrodes and counter electrodes were assembled into DSCs. Finally, the redox electrolyte, prepared by dissolving 0.03 M I2, 0.60 M BMII (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), 0.50 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate in a mixture of valeronitrile and acetonitrile (volume ratio 15:85), was added.

The structure of the samples was measured via X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2550). The morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2010). Diffuse-reflectance spectra were studied on the films using a spectrophotometer (UV-vis, Cary-500 spectrometer, 200–800 nm wavelength, Varian Ltd.). The I–V investigations of the DSCs were measured at 1 sun conditions (100 mW cm−2 at AM1.5) by a Newport I–V tester (Oriel Class A 91160A). The IPCE was tested by a 300 W Xe light source (Oriel) with a monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectra were studied by a potentiostat (Versastat, Ametek). NaOH aqueous solution (0.05 M) was used to desorb the dye and the amounts of desorbed dye were measured by UV-vis spectroscopy.


The SEM image shown in Fig. 2a indicates that the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials with a length of up to about 150 nm and a diameter of about 40 nm are obtained. Furthermore, as TiCl4 vapor gas is believed to be in an excess, some TiO2 nanoparticles are seen to exist on the surface of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials. The SnO2 nanorods with a length of 150 nm and an average diameter of 20 nm are uniformly coated by TiO2 with a thickness of about 10 nm (Fig. 2b). An adjacent interplanar spacing of 0.33 nm is observed perpendicular to the growth direction, which corresponds to the (110) plane (Fig. 2c), indicating that [001] is the preferential growth direction of the SnO2 nanorods. In addition, there are no lattice fringes found in the TiO2 shell, suggesting that the TiO2 shell is amorphous. The EDS mappings of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI).

All the peaks in the X-ray powder diffractogram (Fig. 2d) of the as-prepared SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials are directly indexed to SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445), suggesting the good crystal nature of the SnO2 nanorods. From the (110) and (101) crystal planes, the lattice parameters can be estimated by the relation 1/d2 = (h2 + k2)/a2 + l2/c2. The results are a = 4.735 Å and c = 3.183 Å, in accordance with the standard values of bulk SnO2 (a = 4.740 and c = 3.190 Å) from JCPDS card 41-1445. The width of the peaks is consistent with a 28.0 nm particle size, calculated by the Scherrer equation from the full-width at half maximum of the SnO2 (110) peak. No peaks of TiO2 are found, indicating that the TiO2 is amorphous, which is in good agreement with the TEM image. The TiCl4 vapor was introduced at a temperature of about 500 °C, at a very fast speed (∼0.4 m s−1), and then TiCl4 molecules hydrolyzed into TiO2 and were coated on the SnO2 nanorods. As this happened quickly, TiO2 did not have enough time to turn into crystals. In addition, after annealing for 30 min at 450 °C (required in the DSC fabrication process), there is no obvious change to the XRD pattern, indicating that the structure of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials has not obviously changed during the fabrication of the photoelectrode. The SEM image of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 materials after annealing at 450 °C for 30 min is given in Fig. S2, suggesting that the morphology of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials has not obviously changed in the annealing process.

To gain further insight into the band gap energy of the samples, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy characterization was performed (Fig. 3a). As expected, the pure SnO2 nanorods show an absorption edge at about 320 nm, while that of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 materials is at about 380 nm. The band gap energy of the samples can be estimated by the relationship between hν and (αhν)2, where α is the absorption coefficient and ν is the light frequency (Fig. 3b). The band gap energy of the SnO2 nanorods is 3.56 eV and that of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials is 3.28 eV. It is well known that the band gap energy of conventional TiO2 is 3.2 eV; in our experiment, owing to the presence of SnO2 nanorods, the band gap energy shifts to a slightly higher value.

To distinguish the chemical composition of the SnO2 nanorods and the coated TiO2 layer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out (Fig. 4). There are three obvious differences after the coating of TiO2. The XPS spectra of SnO2 nanorods for Sn 3d shows two peaks in the Sn 3d region: 484.43 eV assigned to Sn 3d5/2 and 492.78 eV corresponding to Sn 3d3/2. After coating with TiO2 the intensity of the peaks became much lower, and the location of the peaks shifted to a higher region. Then, after the coating of TiO2, the two XPS peaks of Ti 2p emerge: the first one at 456.63 eV corresponds to Ti 2p3/2 and the other one at 462.33 eV is assigned to Ti 2p1/2. Finally, the peak of 528.23 eV for O 1s shifts to 527.88 eV, which is a 0.35 eV shift to a lower bending energy.
It can be concluded that, before coating with TiO2, the SnO2 nanorods show the normal peaks of rutile SnO2. After coating, the intensities of the peaks of SnO2 become much lower, and the peaks of TiO2 emerge, suggesting that the SnO2 nanorods are uniformly coated by TiO2, which is in good agreement with the TEM image. The peaks of TiO2 shift towards lower bending energies compared to other reports (459.4 eV for Ti 2p3/2, 465.1 eV for Ti 2p1/2), indicating that the existence of SnO2 affects the chemical composition of TiO2.

In order to demonstrate the DSC performance of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials, a SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 film was fabricated. Films of P25 nanoparticles and SnO2 nanorods were also fabricated for comparison. The morphology (Fig. S3, ESI) and chemical composition (Fig. S4, ESI) of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 materials was not significantly changed during the DSC fabrication process.

The I–V curves of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 5, and Table 1 summarizes the resultant photovoltaic parameters. The electrode derived from the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials shows a highest short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.15 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.78 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.55. The remarkable improvement of the Jsc may be attributed to the high dye loading amount, high light harvesting efficiency and the fast electron transport process. The increase of the Voc is attributed mainly to the low charge recombination rate due to the SnO2 and TiO2 hybrid. These factors are verified and discussed later. As a result, the electrode shows the highest power conversion efficiency of 6.98%, 76.7% higher than the SnO2 nanorods electrode (3.95%), and also much higher than the P25 electrode (5.27%). The SnO2 nanorods electrode shows the lowest power conversion efficiency, which is mainly a consequence of the lowest Jsc of 8.64 mA cm−2. Table 1 also summarizes the N719 dye loading. The dye loading capacity of the SnO2 nanorods film is much lower than SnO2 nanorod@TiO2, the dye loading capacity of which is almost the same as the P25 film. The BET specific surface area (Fig. S5, ESI) of the SnO2 nanorods is 11.9 m2 g−1, smaller than that of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 (34.7 m2 g−1) and P25 (49.6 m2 g−1) electrodes. The larger specific surface area of SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 over the SnO2 nanorods is derived from the coating of TiO2 which is beneficial for increasing the dye loading amount.

Fig. 5b shows the diffuse-reflectance spectra of the three films, revealing the difference in the light-scattering capacity. Higher reflectivity means better light-scattering capacity, indicating the higher light harvesting efficiency of the photoelectrodes. The SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 film shows the highest reflectance value over the range of 350–500 nm, almost the same as the SnO2 nanorods. However, over the range of 500–800 nm, the SnO2 nanorods film shows the highest reflectance value, even a little higher than that of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 film. The SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 and SnO2 nanorods films have a higher light-scattering ability, resulting in more trapped light. More trapped light improves the quantity of electrons produced in the electrode, which greatly enhances the Jsc.
To further investigate the enhanced properties of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid electrode, the electron transport properties were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark. Two semicircles are observed from the Nyquist diagrams (Fig. 5c). The semicircles at high frequency (>1000 Hz) represent the charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface, and the semicircles at mid-frequency (10–100 Hz) are associated with the process of charge transfer across the photoelectrode/dye/electrolyte interface. The size of the semicircle represents the resistance to electron and hole recombination. The largest semicircle in the mid-frequency range is observed for the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid photoelectrode, which means increased recombination resistance at the photoelectrode/dye/electrolyte interface, and suppression of the recombination rates for DSCs using the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid photoelectrode. In addition, as shown in the Nyquist diagrams from EIS under illumination (Fig. S3, ESI), the semicircle diameter of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 electrode is bigger than that of the SnO2 nanorods electrode, but much smaller than that of P25, indicating that the charge transfer ability of SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 is much higher than that of P25.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the cells based on the three films are shown in Fig. 5d. Over the whole spectral range, the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 cell shows the highest IPCE values and the cell of SnO2 nanorods shows the lowest values. The increased IPCE value is mainly due to the increased dye loading amount and the suppression of electron combination provided by the TiO2 and SnO2 hybrid.

Fig. 6 shows the Bode diagrams in which the frequency peak position (fmax) can be observed. The electron lifetime (τr) associated with the charge recombination process at the electrode/electrolyte/dye interfaces can be calculated from the maximum frequency peak position of the impedance semicircle at low frequencies, using the equation τr = 1/2πfmax. A longer electron lifetime means less recombination of electrons and holes. The SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 electrode significantly shifts fmax to 6 Hz, compared to 26 Hz for the SnO2 nanorods electrode and 11 Hz for the plain P25 electrode, which equates to 4.33 and 1.83 times the electron lifetime. The results indicate that the coating of TiO2 suppresses the combination of electrons and holes, which provides a longer electron lifetime. A longer electron lifetime means a longer electron diffusion length, resulting in increased charge collection and a higher Jsc.

Table 2 summarises the parameters estimated from EIS. The charge recombination resistance at the photoelectrode/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct) is associated with recombination between the electrons and holes at the electrolyte and the conducting band of the photoelectrode, and is estimated from the Nyquist diagrams from EIS in the dark at the mid-frequency. The Rct value of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 photoelectrode is estimated to be the highest (493.8 Ω). This means that the hybrid materials are better in suppressing the recombination between electrons and holes. The electron transport resistance (Rt) is estimated from the Nyquist diagrams under illumination (Fig. S6, ESI). The Rt of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 photoelectrode is 26.2 Ω, smaller than P25 photoelectrode, but higher than the SnO2 nanorods photoelectrode, indicating faster electron transport in comparison to that of P25, but slower than that of the SnO2 nanorods. Suppression of the charge recombination rate and fast electron transport in the photoelectrode results in a long electron lifetime, and as a result, the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 photoelectrode shows the longest electron lifetime of 26.5 ms. Therefore, from the EIS analysis, it can be concluded that the hybrid structure decreases the charge transfer resistance compared to P25 and significantly improves the recombination resistance compared to the SnO2 nanorods, leading to a dramatic increase of the power conversion efficiency.

There are three factors which contribute to the outstanding DSC performance of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 electrode. Firstly, when the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials are used, the film possesses a better light scattering effect (Fig. 7a–c), which can be observed from the diffuse-reflectance spectra. The scattered light can obviously increase the quantity of electrons produced in the electrode and enhance the DSC performance. Secondly, the 1-D structure can provide shortened electron transfer routes, which can facilitate the fast electron transport process. Because of the difference of the conduction band edge positions which generates the potential gradient at the interface of the composite, hybrid structure semiconductor materials are beneficial for the charge transfer and separation. As the conduction band edge of SnO2 is much more positive than that of TiO2 (Fig. S7, ESI), an efficient energy cascade is formed (Fig. 7d). The electrons in TiO2 can be easily injected into the SnO2 nanorods, leading to fast electron separation to the current-collecting surface. These factors favor charge separation and suppress charge recombination, leading to a considerably improved Voc and power conversion efficiency. Thirdly, compared to SnO2 nanorods, the introduction of the TiO2 coating can significantly enhance the amount of dye loading for increased light absorption, and then a remarkable energy conversion efficiency is achieved.

In summary, SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials were designed and prepared by coating a layer of TiO2 on the surface of SnO2 nanorods using a modified flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) approach. The coating of TiO2in situ was carried out by simply introducing TiCl4 vapor above the flame in which the SnO2 nanorods were formed. The TiCl4 vapor hydrolyzed at high temperature, supplied by the flame, and then the obtained TiO2 was coated on the SnO2 nanorods. The as-prepared SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials have a length of up to about 150 nm and a diameter of about 40 nm. TiO2 is uniformly coated on the well-crystallized SnO2 with a diameter of about 10 nm. The DSC properties of the SnO2 nanorod@TiO2 hybrid materials were studied. The power conversion efficiency (η) is 6.98%, which is increased by 76.7% and 32.4% compared to those of the SnO2 nanorods (3.95%) and P25 (5.27%) films. There are three factors which contributed to the outstanding DSC performance: a superior light scattering effect, suppression of charge recombination, and an increased dye loading amount.
