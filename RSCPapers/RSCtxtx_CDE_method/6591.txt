Two regioisomeric indolo[3,2-b]carbazoles end-substituted with diketopyrrolopyrrole dyes (3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC) were synthesized, and their solid-state properties and performance as donor materials for bulk heterojunction solar cells using [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor material were evaluated. Depending on the regiochemistry of backbone linkages (3,9- or 2,8-linkage), these two compounds showed quite different solid-state aggregation behaviors (crystalline versus amorphous), leading to a significant difference in the degree of phase separation upon blending with PCBM. As a result, a distinct effect of thermal annealing on the device parameters of solar cells (Voc and Jsc) was observed for these compounds although both the devices showed almost the same power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ca. 0.7% with thermal annealing at 130 °C. For 3,9-TDPPIC, the highest PCE of 1.8% was achieved by further optimization of the device.

Small-molecular materials for solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have attracted increasing attention in the past few years due to their well-defined molecular structures that enable construction of OPV devices with molecular level precision. For the design of such small-molecular materials, not only their intrinsic electronic properties, but also their solid-state properties, particularly aggregation properties, are important because they directly affect the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures widely used for solution-processed OPV devices. To overcome the relatively low short-circuit current density (Jsc) of small molecular materials, planar π-conjugated compounds are used as the core unit to make continuous charge carrier pathways through π–π stacking interaction. For instance, benzodithiophene, naphthodithiophene, pyrene, hexabenzocoronene, and dibenzotetrathienocoronene have been applied to small molecular semiconductors for OPV devices with relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE). For these π-systems, their relatively low light-absorption capabilities are compensated by conjugation with dye compounds such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives. In this context, the molecular design of such conjugated π-systems particularly focusing on their linkage positions of different molecular parts plays an important role in the device performance because their molecular geometries strongly affect molecular packing in the solid state.

Indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (IC) derivatives have a fused structure of two carbazoles, and thereby exhibit higher hole transporting properties in field effect transistor (FET) devices compared to carbazole derivatives. They also show high electron donating properties while having high thermal and photochemical stabilities. These properties make IC derivatives promising donor modules for a new class of low-band-gap polymer materials for solution-processed solar cells. Furthermore, functional groups can be introduced at the 2,8- or 3,9-positions of IC, enabling control of the molecular packing. Despite these attractive properties, IC derivatives have not been applied to a segment of small-molecular materials for OPV devices. It is expected that the regioisomeric molecular variation on the IC core could control the aggregation of the resulting materials in BHJ thin films, providing useful insight into the structure–property relationship in organic photovoltaics. In the present study we synthesized two regioisomeric IC-based small molecular materials, 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC (Fig. 1a), and investigated their solid-state physical properties and device performances. Different molecular packing is expected for these two regioisomeric materials as a result of different molecular shapes, which could affect the performance of the devices.

3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC are end-functionalized with thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) dyes, which have unique potential as electron-accepting modules for small-molecular and polymer OPV materials. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the electron density of the HOMO is delocalized over the whole molecules, while that of the LUMO is on the TDPP groups for both compounds (Fig. 1b). The electron density distributions of the two compounds are almost the same, indicating that the position of the TDPP-substitution at the IC core has no effect on their electronic properties.

3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC were synthesized according to Scheme S1 in the ESI. Briefly, 3,9- and 2,8-bis(dioxaborolan-2-yl)-indolo[3,2-b]carbazoles were reacted with monobrominated TDPP compoundsvia Suzuki coupling reaction to give 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC, respectively. Purification was performed by recycling gel permeation chromatography, and 1H NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, and elemental analyses showed that the target compounds were obtained in high purity. 2,8-TDPPIC showed good solubilities for chloroform (>20 mg mL−1) and chlorobenzene (>10 mg mL−1). However, 3,9-TDPPIC is less soluble in chlorobenzene (<1 mg mL−1), and only chloroform could dissolve this compound up to ca. 10 mg mL−1. These results already indicate that 3,9-TDPPIC has stronger intermolecular interaction compared to 2,8-TDPPIC.
The thermal properties of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both compounds showed single endothermic peaks at around 250 °C, which are ascribable to the melting transition (Fig. 2a). While 3,9-TDPPIC showed an exothermic crystallization peak at 195 °C in the subsequent cooling scan, 2,8-TDPPIC did not show such a peak up to room temperature, suggesting the formation of the glassy state. This was supported by the absence of any endothermic peak in the 2nd heating scan of 2,8-TDPPIC. The different solidification behaviors of these two compounds, combined with the different solubilities described above, suggest that the molecular geometry of 3,9-TDPPIC has higher crystalline packing efficiency compared to that of 2,8-TDPPIC. This finding was supported by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the two compounds (Fig. 2b). Upon casting the chloroform solution of 3,9-TDPPIC, the resultant film showed an intense diffraction at d = 15.3 Å. However, no notable diffraction was observed for the film of 2,8-TDPPIC prepared by the same method.

UV/vis absorption spectra of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC were recorded in chloroform and in the film state obtained by evaporating the solvent (Fig. 3). In chloroform, both compounds show an absorption band at around 600 nm, attributable to the charge transfer (CT) transition of TDPP units. A weaker absorption band was observed at 392 nm for 3,9-TDPPIC, which can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the IC backbone. For 2,8-TDPPIC, this band was observed at much higher-energy region (321 nm).

When chloroform solutions of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC were drop-cast to form thin films, a red-shifted absorption band appeared at 635 nm for both compounds due to intermolecular excitonic interaction between TDPP units. This absorption band could be related to a slipped (J-type) π–π stacking arrangement of the TDPP chromophores. Because 2,8-TDPPIC displays this band in higher intensity compared to that of 3,9-TDPPIC, it is suggested that nonlinear molecular geometry tends to form less-overlapped (or slipped) π–π stacking arrangements. When the 3,9-TDPPIC film was annealed at 160 °C, the absorption spectra showed almost no change (Fig. 3a), indicating the formation of thermodynamically stable aggregates upon solution-casting. In contrast, the 2,8-TDPPIC film showed a decrease of the red-shifted band after annealing, and the spectra obtained with annealing temperatures above 130 °C are almost similar to those of the 3,9-TDPPIC film (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that 2,8-TDPPIC can be trapped in a kinetically stable aggregated state through solution-casting, probably due to its more S-shaped molecular structure. The formation of kinetic aggregates by 2,8-TDPPIC is consistent with the results of DSC and XRD.

The charge carrier mobilities of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC were evaluated by fabricating top contact field-effect transistors (FETs). The device with an as-cast film (chloroform) of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC showed almost comparable hole mobilities of 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Thermal annealing of the films at 130 °C caused only a negligible increase of the mobility for 3,9-TDPPIC (1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) whilst for 2,8-TDPPIC a clear increase to 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was observed. The visible impact of the thermal annealing for the latter material is consistent with a larger π–π overlapping upon annealing as demonstrated by the UV/vis study (Fig. 3). The hole mobilities of the two compounds are more than one order of magnitude lower than the FET electron mobility of PCBM (measured in the range of 10−3 to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1).



Table 1 summarizes optical and electrochemical properties of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC. The HOMO levels of these compounds were evaluated by using photoelectron yield spectroscopy under atmospheric pressure. Both compounds exhibited very similar HOMO levels, i.e., 5.20 eV for 3,9-TDPPIC and 5.28 eV for 2,8-TDPPIC. From these HOMO levels and the HOMO–LUMO gaps estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra (1.78 eV for both compounds), the LUMO levels of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC were calculated to be 3.42 eV and 3.50 eV, respectively. These energy levels are appropriate for photovoltaic devices using PCBM as an n-type semiconductor. Because the LUMO of PCBM has been reported to be 4.30 eV, the difference between the LUMO of PCBM and the HOMO of TDPPICs is about 1.0 eV, which is expected to give open circuit voltage (Voc) values of roughly 0.7 V by taking into account the empirical difference between theoretical and experimental Voc reported by Scharber et al. In addition, the energy difference between the LUMO levels of TDPPICs and PCBM is about 0.8 eV, which is sufficient for efficient charge separation.

The photovoltaic properties of 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC were evaluated as donor materials for BHJ solar cells using PCBM as an acceptor material with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TDPPICs:PCBM/Ca/Al. The BHJ films were prepared by spin-coating of chloroform solutions of the mixtures (20 mg mL−1). The annealing temperature of the resultant films and the blending ratio of the donor and the acceptor materials were varied to optimize device performance, and Jsc, Voc, and fill factors (FF) of the fabricated devices are summarized in Table 2 (3,9-TDPPIC) and Table 3 (2,8-TDPPIC).

The devices with the blend ratio of 5:5 showed that thermal annealing at a specific temperature is effective for both 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC. The devices using as-cast films showed PCEs of only ca. 0.4% for both compounds. The increase of the annealing temperature to 100 °C did not improve Jsc values. However, abrupt increases of Jsc were observed when the annealing temperature was raised to 130 °C (Fig. 4), showing 3.83 mA cm−2 for 3,9-TDPPIC and 2.86 mA cm−2 for 2,8-TDPPIC. These improvements in Jsc resulted in the increases of PCE to around 0.7% for both compounds. The effective thermal annealing at 130 °C for both the 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC devices might be due to the glass transition of PCBM (Tg = 110–130 °C) that promotes the phase separation with the donors. A more pronounced increase of the Jsc values of 2,8-TDPPIC (1.73 → 2.86 mA cm−2) compared to those of 3,9-TDPPIC (3.50 → 3.83 mA cm−2) implied that the former compound undergoes a certain degree of structural ordering upon annealing at 130 °C, which is also supported by the UV/vis and FET study. Indeed, we observed an abrupt emergence of a diffraction peak at d = 16.4 Å after annealing the blend film of 2,8-TDPPIC:PCBM at 130 °C (Fig. S1). In contrast, the blend film of 3,9-TDPPIC:PCBM displayed an intense diffraction already in the as-prepared state (Fig. S1).
Although 3,9-TDPPIC showed higher Jsc than that of 2,8-TDPPIC in the 130 °C annealed devices, they showed only a minor difference in PCE. This can be explained by the lower Voc of the former device despite the fact that both materials have almost the same HOMO levels. Confocal laser scanning microscope observation showed that the as-cast film of 2,8-TDPPIC:PCBM has a relatively smooth surface with a small amount of crystallites (Fig. 5a), whereas that of 3,9-TDPPIC:PCBM showed the formation of micrometer size crystallites (Fig. 5b). Although various factors could determine Voc of OPV devices, the rougher film surface of 3,9-TDPPIC:PCBM compared to that of 2,8-TDPPIC:PCBM might be one of the reasons to decrease Voc due to insufficient contact between the electrode and the active layer. When the BHJ films were annealed at 160 °C, a large drop of the device performance was observed for both 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC. This is most likely due to the increase of the molecular mobility of the donor materials, which promotes phase separation.
Further improvements of the device performance were achieved for both 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC upon increasing the donor content from donor/PCBM = 5:5 to 7:3, while keeping the annealing temperature at 130 °C (Tables 2 and 3). The J–V response and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. S2. Upon increasing the donor concentration, Jsc increased from 3.82 to 5.00 mA cm−2 (FF: 33.5 → 41.5%) for 3,9-TDPPIC, and from 2.86 to 3.92 mA cm−2 (FF: 36.1 → 50.8%) for 2,8-TDPPIC. The notable impact upon increasing the donor content is ascribable to their lower hole mobilities compared to PCBM as demonstrated by the FET study, and a larger amount of the donor materials is required to balance the charge carrier mobilities in the devices.
Because TDPPICs have relatively low mobilities, we decreased the total concentrations of the 7:3 mixtures of TDPPICs:PCBM in chloroform from 20 to 12 mg mL−1 to decrease the internal resistance of the devices. For 3,9-TDPPIC, the highest PCE of 1.8% was achieved with these conditions (Fig. 4 and Table 2). In contrast, a decrease of PCE from 1.4 to 0.7% was observed for 2,8-TDPPIC upon decreasing the total concentrations of the materials (Fig. 4 and Table 3). The increase of PCE upon decreasing the material concentration for the 3,9-TDPPIC device is consistent with the lower mobility of this material that increases the internal resistance of the active layer upon increasing the film thickness. However, in the case of 2,8-TDPPIC, which has a higher mobility than 3,9-TDPPIC, the decrease of the material concentration has a negative impact because it might lower the light absorption efficiency.

In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized two novel donor materials 3,9-TDPPIC and 2,8-TDPPIC, containing indolocarbazole units as the core and TDPP moieties as dye units for application in solution-processed organic solar cells. Although the two donor materials have almost the same optical and electrochemical properties, they showed quite different packing behavior and inverse structural ordering upon thermal annealing. 3,9-TDPPIC with more linear molecular geometry shows higher crystallinity, and therefore thermal annealing effectively decreases the degree of phase separation. In contrast, 2,8-TDPPIC with more S-shaped molecular structure forms an amorphous structure through solution-casting, and thereby thermal annealing increases the degree of phase separation. The clear correlation between the solid-state properties and the impact of thermal annealing on the device performance, as demonstrated by the two compounds with well-defined structural features (linear and S-shapes), provides useful insight into the design of small molecular materials for high-performance BHJ-OPV devices.
