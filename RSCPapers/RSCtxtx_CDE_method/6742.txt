As a new generation of solid-state film cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) have become the research focus in the field of renewable energy sources, and the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been boosted to 18%. Hole transport layer (HTL) materials, a critical component of OSCs, exert a tremendous impact on the PCE and stability of OSCs. At present, the HTL materials used in OSCs can be divided into two main categories, which are inorganic HTL materials and organic HTL materials. Although, OSCs with inorganic HTL materials can achieve satisfactory PCE, they are not suitable for large-scale commercial roll-to-roll production due to the unavoidable process of high-temperature vacuum evaporation. Recently, a great number of organic HTL materials have been designed, synthesized, and successfully applied in OSCs. Herein, we review the recent advances in organic HTL materials in single-junction OSCs and systematically discuss the relationships between the structure and properties of various HTL materials, and highlight the design rules of HTL materials for highly efficient and stable OSCs.

Solar energy is an inexhaustible green energy. Converting solar energy into electrical energy is one of the most effective methods to solve the energy and environmental problems and develop a low-carbon economy. Nowadays, many kinds of solar cells are being explored and studied, such as silicon solar cells, polycrystal silicon solar cells, cadmium telluride solar cells, CIGS solar cells and organic solar cells (OSCs). The first several inorganic solar cells have been commercialized, with power conversion efficiency (PCE) between 22% and 31%. Unfortunately, despite the advantages of acceptable PCE, inorganic solar cells have the fatal disadvantages of high production cost, high energy consumption and heavy pollution, which significantly limit their further commercial application. In contrast, OSCs have attracted increasing attention owing to their outstanding properties such as abundant raw materials, low cost roll-to-roll printing, light weight, flexibility, etc.

The first OSCs were prepared with a sandwich structure by Kearns and Calvin in 1958. Magnesium phthalocyanine was inserted between two different work function (WF) electrodes, but the PCE of the cell was very low. In 1986, Kodak's Dr Deng designed the first double-layer heterojunction OSCs, and the PCE reached 1%. In 1995, Heeger put forward the concept of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs. Shaheen et al. achieved BHJ OSCs with a PCE of 2.5% based on the MDMO-PPV:PC61BM active layer system in 2001. In 2003, Sariciftci et al. reported BHJ OSCs based on the P3HT:PC61BM system, with a PCE of up to 3.5%. In 2010, Yu et al. obtained a PCE value of up to 7.4% with a PTB7:PC71BM active layer. And in 2016, Xiaowei Zhan and Jianhui Hou explored many valuable non-fullerene acceptor materials, which boosted the PCE of OSCs to over 13%. With the rapid development of high-performance donor materials (PBDB-T-SF, PBDB-T, PffBT4T-2OD, J71, PM6, PTQ10, PDTB-EF-T, T1, and D18 (ref. 18)), acceptor materials (ICBA, MEH-CN-PPV, ITIC, IM-4F, IT-4F, NFBDT, PBDT-TT, Y6, and Y11 (ref. 25)) and interfacial materials (ZnO, LiF, PFN, WOx:PEDOT:PSS, and CPE-K), the PCE of state-of-the-art single-junction OSCs has increased by leaps and bounds, and the value of the PCE is up to 18.22% in January 2020. The progress of the PCE of OSCs is shown in Fig. 1. The research of Brabec group's demonstrated that the lifetime of OSCs can be up to 10 years. With the continuous exploration of high-performance materials and the outstanding achievements obtained by numerous research groups, the PCE and lifetime of OSCs will be further dramatically enhanced.
The best single-junction OSCs reported to date are composed of an active layer BHJ film sandwiched between an anode, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), and a metal cathode. Under light conditions, excitons generated by the active layer diffuse to the interface between the donor and the acceptor, and then the excitons separate to form charges, which could move to the corresponding electrode under the inherent electric field caused by the work function difference between the electrodes. Ultimately, the charges will be collected by the electrode to form photocurrent. The hole transport layer (HTL) is a significant constituent of OSCs and plays a crucial role in enhancing the PCE and long-term stability of OSCs. From the viewpoint of interfacial contact, proper modification of the anode electrode by inserting an HTL is an effective and facile strategy to dramatically enhance the PCE of OSCs. Firstly, the HTL can enhance the WF of the ITO anode and decrease the interfacial energy barrier between the anode and active layer, thus promoting the formation of an ohmic contact between the ITO anode and the active layer. Secondly, the HTL can also block the electrons and reduce the recombination of interfacial charge. Thirdly, the HTL can physically modulate the surface of the ITO anode, passivate the surface defects and pinholes, and reduce the leakage current. Finally, the HTL can regulate the morphology and absorbance of the active layer and increase the PCE of OSCs. From the viewpoint of the device, selecting an appropriate HTL can effectively increase the built-in potential of the device and significantly enhance the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the device. Meanwhile, a suitable HTL would drastically improve the apparent carrier abstraction and collection efficiency, and then directly affect the short-circuit current (Jsc) of the device. In addition, an appropriate HTL can efficiently prevent the formation of space charges in the working state of the device, thereby improving the photogenerated current and the fill factor (FF) of the device. Consequently, it's of crucial importance to choose the right HTL to improve the PCE of OSCs.
Early HTLs were mainly inorganic p-type transition metal oxides or metal sulfides, such as MoO3, NiO, WO3, Fe3O4, RuO2, MoS2 (ref. 42) and so on. Inorganic HTLs have good optical transparency in the visible and near-infrared regions, excellent ambient stability, prominent hole collection efficiency and electron-blocking capability, and suitable WF. However, these inorganic HTLs need to be prepared by a vacuum deposition process, which is impossible to realize for future large-area printing processes. In sharp contrast to the early inorganic HTLs, organic HTLs have many merits, such as low price, no toxicity or low toxicity, and a wide range of performance adjustable parameters (the energy level, hole transport characteristics and molecular stacking mode can be effectively regulated by chemical cutting). In addition, organic HTLs can also be processed by inkjet printing or roll-to-roll printing, which solves the interface problems faced by OSC solution processing and offers great convenience for the fabrication of large-area flexible OSC devices. This review summarizes the latest progress in organic HTLs for high performance OSCs, including conducting polymers, graphene oxides and other emerging organic materials. By analyzing the relationship between the structure and properties in various HTLs, the design rules of HTLs towards high efficiency and stable OSCs have been highlighted. In the end, we summarized the research status of the HTLs of OSCs and proposed prospects for future development.

The conducting polymer of PEDOT:PSS (P VP Al 4083) is the most commonly used solution-processable HTL for conventional single-junction OSCs. PEDOT:PSS is prepared in an aqueous emulsion with the presence of PSS by the oxidative polymerization of ethylenedioxythiophene. Water-soluble PEDOT:PSS with unique solubility characteristics possesses many superiorities when acting as a HTL for OSCs, such as: (i) based on the difference of solubility between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer, OSC devices are processed by orthogonal solvent to avoid interfacial miscibility; (ii) the use of environmentally friendly water solvents for processing is beneficial for the industrial large-scale production of OSCs; (iii) the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be adjusted by changing the composition ratio between PEDOT and PSS, which provides great flexibility for modulating the electrical properties of the interface between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer; (iv) PEDOT:PSS has outstanding optical transparency in the visible and near-infrared ranges, minimizing absorption loss; (v) the WF of PEDOT:PSS is −5.10 eV, which can be well-matched with the quasi-Fermi levels of holes of many donor materials, promoting the formation of an ohmic contact between the ITO anode and active layer (see Fig. 2). Taking these benefits into consideration, PEDOT:PSS has attracted growing attention and has been rapidly developed.

However, as a conventional OSC HTL, PEDOT:PSS also has some shortcomings and they need to be solved: (i) acidic PEDOT:PSS will corrode the ITO anode, resulting in the diffusion of In ions into PEDOT:PSS and the active layer, thereby impairing the stability of OSCs; (ii) PEDOT:PSS can absorb moisture and oxygen from the air, which will accelerate the degradation of the interface between ITO and PEDOT:PSS; (iii) the WF of PEDOT:PSS needs to be further deepened to match the very deep HOMO levels of the donor materials to create an ohmic contact; (iv) the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is low, which impairs the PCE and is incompatible with large-scale printing processes; (v) the electrical and structural inhomogeneities of PEDOT:PSS may limit the collection of holes. In order to overcome the above shortcomings of PEDOT:PSS, a lot of improvement work has been conducted and achieved fruitful results.

Conductivity is an important factor that should be considered when selecting the HTL, because a highly conductive HTL can minimize the resistive losses of OSCs, reduce the voltage drop in the interface layer, and maximize the internal field of the active layer, thereby improving field-dependent exciton dissociation. However, PEDOT:PSS has a low conductivity of only 10−4 to 10−3 S cm−1. The optimum thickness needs to be controlled at 30–40 nm to ensure that holes can efficiently transport between the active layer and the ITO anode, while small thickness fluctuations often seriously affect the PCE of the OSC devices. In the future, it is difficult to control the thickness of PEDOT:PSS in the range of 30–40 nm without obvious thickness deviation for large-area OSC device preparation technologies, such as inkjet printing, blade scraping, roll-to-roll printing, etc. Therefore, only PEDOT:PSS with dramatically improved conductivity can be used in large-area OSC devices. There are three appealing methods for improving the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS: (i) changing the phase separation structure of PEDOT and PSS to increase the conductivity; (ii) reducing the content of insulating PSS to enhance the conductivity; (iii) adding highly conductive additives to improve the conductivity.

Many reports have shown that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be greatly enhanced by adjusting the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS. Ouyang et al. promoted the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS by blending PEDOT:PSS with polar organic solvents, thus increasing the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Eom et al. found that when PEDOT:PSS was mixed with glycerol, glycerol promoted the expansion and aggregation of the PEDOT phase, and the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was increased from 7.82 × 10−1 S cm−1 to 1.52 × 102 S cm−1. With the glycerol blended PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, the P3HT:PC61BM devices delivered a PCE of 3.20%, which was superior to that of the device with bare PEDOT:PSS. Adding 2-propanol into PEDOT:PSS, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was enhanced from 5.18 × 10−4 S cm−1 to 2.42 × 10−3 S cm−1. The PCE of P3HT:PC61BM devices with 2-propanol blended with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL reached an unprecedented value of 4.70%. Kadem and colleagues investigated the effects of metal chlorides on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, manifesting that metal chlorides could promote the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Among them, blending PEDOT:PSS with LiCl yielded conductivity as high as 0.48 S cm−1, and the PCE of P3HT:PC61BM devices was improved from 3.90% to 6.80%. Zhao et al. weakened the coulombic attractions between PEDOT and PSS components to facilitate the phase separation between them by blending PEDOT:PSS with CuBr2. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was enhanced from 1.90 × 10−4 S cm−1 to 8.40 × 10−3 S cm−1, and the PCE of PCDTBT:PC71BM devices was improved from 5.80% to 7.00%. Chen et al. spin-coated low-cost sulfonate poly(aryl ether sulfone) onto PEDOT:PSS. The research demonstrated that poly(aryl ether sulfone) could replace most of the insulating PSS to form a continuous PEDOT conductive area, thereby enhancing the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS remarkably. Additionally, Chen's group also spin-coated liquid crystal ionic liquids on the surface of a PEDOT:PSS film to induce an ordered PEDOT microstructure, which could also effectively improve the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film.
The post-treatment technology of reducing the insulating PSS content is also a feasible strategy to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Lee et al. demonstrated that partially insulating PSS has been removed by adding p-toluene sulfonic acid, and the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS has been increased by 30%. Ouyang's group reported post-treatment of PEDOT:PSS with an inorganic salt CuBr2 aqueous solution. Fractional insulating PSS was removed by the association of Br− anions with PEDOT, and the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS increased to 187.50 S cm−1. Li et al. got rid of partially insulating PSS via the post-treatment of PEDOT:PSS with methanol and the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was improved from 5.5 × 10−4 to 4.0 × 10−2 S cm−1. Compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS HTL, the methanol post-treated PEDOT:PSS HTL promoted the Jsc and PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based devices from 14.46 mA cm2 to 16.48 mA cm2, and 8.23% to 9.28%, respectively. The strong acid post-treatment technique is also currently a prevailing approach to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, but the environmental problems related to strong acids should not be ignored. Besides, the impact of corrosion caused by strong acids on the lifetime of OSCs must be taken into consideration seriously. In contrast to strong acid treatment, organic solvent post-treatment, especially the methanol post-treatment technique, is simple, environmentally friendly, and efficient, and is a promising method for improving the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Nevertheless, all the reported methanol post-treatment techniques adopted a spin-coating process. In-depth research of spraying- or scrape-based methanol post-treatment is of vital importance to increase the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and facilitate the roll-to-roll printing of OSCs.
The third common strategy to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is adding a highly conductive additive to PEDOT:PSS. Li et al. manifested that when multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were added into PEDOT:PSS, the MWCNTs can overlap into a net-like structure and form conductive channels. The PEDOT:PSS conductivity was enhanced from 0.28 S cm−1 to 9.16 S cm−1 owing to the contribution of conductive channels. Wang et al. fabricated a PEDOT:PSS:MWCNT blend material via the dissolution of MWCNTs into the PSS solution, followed by polymerization with EDOT. The PEDOT:PSS:MWCNTs exhibited a special structure, with MWCNTs as the core and PEDOT:PSS as the wrapping layer. The chains of MWCNTs and PEDOT:PSS can form a larger conducting system via π–π conjugation, which dramatically increased the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Wang et al. reported that the conformation of PEDOT could be changed from coil to linear by adding nano-WS2. Consequently, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS has been improved up to 1.40 × 10−3 S cm−1. With PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the active layer, the Jsc and PCE of the device with the PEDOT:PSS:WS2 HTL were obviously superior to those of the device with the bare PEDOT:PSS HTL (Jsc: 15.67 mA cm2vs. 14.25 mA cm2 and PCE: 7.20% vs. 6.60%). By blending PEDOT:PSS with 2,3-dihydroxypyridine, Jiang et al. enhanced the hole mobility of PEDOT:PSS from 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 8.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the PCE of P3HT:PC61BM based devices was improved from 2.90% to 3.50%. By blending PEDOT:PSS with sulfonated carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs), Chen et al. increased the hole mobility of PEDOT:PSS from 7.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, the PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM based devices was improved from 3.10% to 3.90% (Table 1).

Considering that acidic PEDOT:PSS would corrode ITO electrodes and shorten the lifetime of OSCs, Chen's team introduced a MoO3 layer between ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers, which not only can effectively protect the ITO from corrosion by the acidic PEDOT:PSS, but also can significantly improve the lifetime of OSCs, thus guiding the fabrication of highly stable OSCs. Rafique et al. inserted a GO layer between ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers, which can effectively protect the ITO from corrosion by the acidic PEDOT:PSS and dramatically prolong the lifetime of OSCs. Shao et al. fabricated a neutral MoO3–PEDOT:PSS composite HTL to defend ITO from damage by the acidic PEDOT:PSS. Under the same conditions, MoO3–PEDOT:PSS based OSCs could retain 80% of their pristine PCE while the PEDOT:PSS based OSCs completely lose their performance. The above literature manifests that the ITO corrosion by PEDOT:PSS can be avoided by introducing a functional interfacial layer between PEDOT:PSS and ITO to increase the lifetime of OSCs, which is of practical significance for commercial OSC products.


PEDOT:PSS absorbs moisture and oxygen from the air, which will speed up the degradation of the interface between ITO and PEDOT:PSS. Choi et al. formed a crosslinking system within PEDOT:PSS by incorporating a photo-crosslinking agent into PEDOT:PSS via fast photopolymerization to convert the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS into hydrophobic PEDOT:PSS, thereby effectively avoiding the moisture absorption by PEDOT:PSS and significantly improving the stability of OSCs. After 570 hours, the crosslinking system devices retained 60% of their PCE, while the pristine PEDOT:PSS devices retained only 40% of their PCE. Hilal et al. incorporated GO into PEDOT:PSS to form a PEDOT:PSS:GO composite, which reduced the moisture absorption of PEDOT:PSS and enhanced the stability of OSCs. Moreover, the stability of OSCs can be improved by inserting a self-assembled monolayer with alkyl siloxanes between ITO and PEDOT:PSS layers. Nardes et al. increased the density of PEDOT:PSS by adding sorbitol into PEDOT:PSS, which also significantly reduced the absorption tendency of PEDOT:PSS towards moisture from the air.

PEDOT:PSS has many advantages, but it also has many shortcomings, such as strong acidity, easy moisture absorption, low conductivity and so on. If the above shortcomings can be solved, PEDOT:PSS will show a comprehensive application prospect.

The deficiency of PEDOT:PSS promotes the vigorous development of new HTL materials. In 2014, Nobel laureate Heeger first proposed the idea of using conjugated polyelectrolytes as HTLs for OSCs. Conjugated polyelectrolytes are composed of a conjugated backbone and side chain bearing ionic functional groups. The conjugated backbone provides the skeleton and determines the optical and electrical properties of the materials, while the side chain bearing ionic functional groups determines the aggregation behavior, solubility and film-formation properties of the materials. The chemical, optical, and electrical properties of conjugated polyelectrolytes can be effectively regulated by tuning the conjugated backbone or side chain. Compared to PEDOT:PSS, conjugated polyelectrolytes are neutral and don't corrode the ITO anode, which can enhance the stability of OSC devices. Secondly, the composition of conjugated polyelectrolytes can be easily modulated according to actual requirements, which provides great flexibility for adjusting their chemical, optical and electrical properties. Thirdly, conjugated polyelectrolytes can deepen the WF of the ITO anode more effectively, which can facilitate Fermi-level pinning to the positive integer charge-transfer state (EICT+) of the active layer and facilitate the formation of an ohmic contact. The selectivity and efficiency of hole transport and collection can be improved by the formation of an ohmic contact with a diminished interfacial energy barrier. The better the ability of electron blocking, the more beneficial it is to suppress the recombination of interface charges and improve the PCE of OSC devices. The above merits of conjugated polyelectrolytes offer an opportunity for developing HTL materials of OSCs with excellent performance.

Heeger reported the first conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, CPE-K (chemical structure shown in Fig. 3). CPE-K was neutral and pH was 7.56, and the ITO anode was therefore not corroded, leading to the improved stability of OSCs. The WF of CPE-K was −5.1 eV, which promoted the formation of an ohmic contact and improved the efficiency of hole extraction and collection. CPE-K exhibited excellent water/alcohol solution processing properties and film-formation properties. In particular, the self-doping effect between the conjugated backbone and side chain of CPE-K can effectively eliminate the inhomogeneity of the charge transport, reduce the Rs, and improve the Jsc and FF of the OSCs. The self-doping effect can also induce the generation of a built-in electric field, and the formation of the dipole direction of the built-in electric field pointing to the ITO anode, which was helpful to improve the Voc of the OSCs. The PCE of PTB7:PC71BM devices with CPE-K as the HTL was 8.20%, which was higher than that of PEDOT:PSS based devices under the same conditions. (The device characteristics are summarized in Table 2). However, the conductivity of CPE-K was lower than that of PEDOT:PSS, so it must be processed as very thin (∼8 nm) in order to obtain the best PCE. In 2015, Heeger et al. reported another kind of conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, CPEPh-Na. CPEPh-Na was neutral and could be processed using water/alcohol solution. The WF was deepened to −5.2 eV, which further improved the efficiency of hole extraction. The PCE of PTBT-Th:PC71BM devices using 8 nm CPEPh-Na as the HTL reached 9.00%, which was much higher than that (7.10%) of PEDOT:PSS devices under the same conditions. However, the conductivity of CPEPh-Na was also lower than that of PEDOT:PSS, so CPEPh-Na was processed with a very thin film (∼8 nm) to obtain the best PCE. Hou et al. reported a HTL material named PCP-Na, the pH of which was measured to be 7.34, and the WF was deepened to −5.22 eV. The PCE of PTDT-TS1:PC71BM devices using 5 nm PCP-Na as the HTL reached 9.90%. Notably, the PCP-Na HTL exhibited excellent thickness insensitivity in fabricating OSC devices; i.e., the OSC devices with very thick PCP-Na HTL layers over 300 nm still demonstrated a high FF of over 70%. In 2018, Hou et al. reported another HTL PCP-H. The PCP-H-modified ITO has the highest WF and the corresponding device exhibits an outstanding PCE of 12.80% with a high Voc of 0.96 V. This was the first report on the application of a conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL in non-fullerene OSCs. For non-fullerene systems with very deep HOMO levels, the WF of PEDOT:PSS needs to be further downshifted to generate an ohmic contact for maximizing the Voc. However, the WF of PEDOT:PSS is difficult to change by current synthesis or post-processing techniques. In contrast, the performance of WF can be greatly regulated by simple molecular design, which makes CPE become more attractive as a HTL material. The 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene unit has strong electron-donating capacity and can produce self-doping effect through side chain, which is beneficial to increase the conductivity and reduce Rs, thus improving the Jsc and FF. The 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene unit has strong electron-donating capacity and can produce a self-doping effect through side chain opposition, which is beneficial to increase the conductivity and reduce Rs, thus improving the Jsc and FF. The built-in electric field generated by the self-doping effect is also helpful to improve the Voc. Using the self-doping effect of 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene unit, Chen's group prepared a new conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, PCPDT-T. The hole mobility of PCPDT-T reached 9.1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was higher than that of PEDOT:PSS. The PCE of PTBT-Th:PC71BM devices with 11 nm PCPDT-T was 9.30%. When the thickness of PCPDT-T increased to 50 nm, the PCE still remained at 7.10%, which was of great significance to the manufacture of large-scale printing cells. Recently, Chen's group reported another kind of 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, PCPDTffPhSO3K, and its hole mobility was 5.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The WF of PCPDTffPhSO3K was −5.16 eV, which improved the efficiency of hole extraction and collection. A PCE of 9.50% was obtained for PTBT-Th:PC71BM devices using PCPDTffPhSO3K as the HTL. Moon et al. also reported a 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, CPE-PCPDT-K. The conductivity of CPE-PCPDT-K was up to 0.01 S cm−1. Therefore, 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL materials provide a reference for thedevelopment of thickness insensitive HTL materials.

The WF of 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolytes is generally not deep, which hinders the effective modification of the WF of the ITO anode effectively. Compared with the 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene unit, the HOMO level of the fluorene unit is lower, which determines the deeper WF of the conjugated polyelectrolyte composed of fluorene units. Hou et al. synthesized a fluorene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, PFS. The WF of PFS was −4.92 eV, and the Voc and PCE of PBDT-TS1:PC71BM devices using 7 nm PFS as the HTL reached 0.79 V and 9.60%, respectively. Hou et al. further reported a HTL material, PFSF. The WF of PFSF reached −5.10 eV. The Voc and PCE of PBDB-T:IM-M devices using 7 nm PFSF as the HTL were 0.90 V and 9.0%, respectively. Lee et al. also synthesized two kinds of fluorene-based poly[9,9-bis(1-sulfonatobutyl-3-yl)-fluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-1,4-phenylene] conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL materials, p-PFP-HD and p-PFP-O. The WF of p-PFP-HD and p-PFP-O was −5.14 eV and −5.26 eV, respectively. The Voc and PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices using 2 nm p-PFP-HD as the HTL were 0.78 V and 9.0%, respectively. The Voc and PCE of PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices with 2–4 nm p-PFP-O as the HTL were 0.78 V and 9.20%, respectively. The WF of p-PFP-O was deeper relative to that of p-PFP-HD, indicating that the hole transport and collection of the ITO anode modified with p-PFP-O was more effective, thus obtaining higher PCE. Tang et al. synthesized a fluorene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte P1. The P1 exhibited an ultradeep WF of −5.4 eV. Under the same conditions, the Voc of the PBDTTPD:PC71BM device with P1 as the HTL reached 0.93 V, which was far superior to that of PEDOT:PSS devices (0.90 V). Choi et al. synthesized PSFP-DTBTP, with WF up to −5.37 eV. The incorporation of PSFP-DTBTP into PEDOT:PSS can effectively regulate the WF of PEDOT:PSS. When the proportion of PSFP-DTBTP reached 5 mg mL−1, the WF of PEDOT:PSS shifted from −4.95 eV to −5.14 eV. The down-shifted WF significantly improved the PCE of PCDTBT:PC71BM devices to 5.30%. This was the first report concerning conjugated polyelectrolyte materials blended with PEDOT:PSS to modulate the WF of PEDOT:PSS.


In addition to 4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene units and fluorene units, conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL materials with new structural units have emerged in recent years. Jen et al. synthesized benzene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL materials, PhNa-1T, PhNa-2T, PhNa-3T and PhNa-1P. The WF of PhNa-1T reached −5.21 eV, which can induce a higher internal field in the OSC device, facilitating efficient hole collection to the ITO anode, and improving the Voc of the OSCs. The Voc and PCE of PTB7:PC71BM devices using 9 nm PhNa-1T as the HTL were 0.75 V and 8.3%, respectively, significantly higher than those of PEDOT:PSS devices. Regardless of the thickness in the range between 4 and 20 nm, the devices consistently show a high PCE of over 7.0%. Inganäs et al. synthesized a 3,4-ethoxylene dioxy thiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, PEDOT-S. PEDOT-S has a WF of −4.9 eV and a notably high conductivity of 0.7 S cm−1. The PCE of P3TI:PC71BM devices with a 25 nm PEDOT-S HTL is as high as 5.1%. When the thickness of PEDOT-S is increased to 50 nm, the value of PCE can remain at 4.4%. A thiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL material, P3CPenT, with a WF of −4.86 eV was synthesized by Li et al. The PCE of P3HT:PC61BM devices with P3CPenT as the HTL was 3.4%, which is comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS based devices under the same conditions. Sulfonated poly (diphenylamine) (SPDPA) which possessed deep WF (−5.24 eV), moderate conductivity (1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1) and high transparency in the visible region was reported. The PCE of the devices based on the P3HT:PC61BM active layer was 4.20%. After 400 hours, the devices still maintained a PCE of 2.80%, demonstrating excellent stability. Park et al. reported an RG1200 HTL with WF similar to that of PEDOT:PSS, but its wetting properties are better than those of PEDOT:PSS. The PCE of P3HT:PC61BM devices based on RG1200 as the HTL is 2.80%.

In addition, a variety of other conjugated polyelectrolytes have also been reported as HTLs for OSCs, showing good processing properties of water/alcohol solution, excellent thermal stability, high transmittance in the visible region and suitable WF, such as PFBTSO3Na, PPP-ORSO3, PPBP-ORSO3, PPV derivative, MPS-PPV, polymer II, PPE-Ar-SO3Na, PPE-PO3Na, PPE-Ar-CO2Na, PBS-PFP and so on.
Nowadays, the PCE and the stability of OSCs modified with conjugated polyelectrolytes are generally superior to those of OSCs modified with PEDOT:PSS. However, there are still some problems needed to be solved urgently. First, the conductivity of conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL materials is low, and is very sensitive to thickness and incompatible with large-scale printing production. Secondly, the long-term stability of conjugated polyelectrolyte modified OSCs has been almost ignored. Again, the interfacial dynamics of conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL materials and the mechanism of the effect of conjugated polyelectrolyte HTL materials on the performance of OSCs are not quite clear.

Graphene oxide (GO) is another very interesting type of HTL material for OSCs. GO is neutral and can be processed in solution and has high light transmittance, and its WF is similar to that of PEDOT:PSS. Especially, the LUMO of GO is −1.6 eV, which possesses excellent electron-blocking capability and can effectively decrease the charge recombination.

In 2010, Li et al. first used 2 nm GO as the HTL for P3HT:PC61BM devices and demonstrated that GO-modified devices had comparable performance to PEDOT:PSS-modified devices. However, the PCE of the devices will decrease significantly with the increase of GO film thickness. Mahmoudi et al. investigated the charge recombination kinetics by performing transient open-circuit voltage delay measurements. They demonstrated that the charge recombination rate of GO devices was lower than that of PEDOT:PSS devices, indicating that GO could efficiently transport holes and block electrons. In 2010, Gao et al. for the first time used 2 nm GO as a HTL in P3HT:PC61BM inverted devices to obtain a PCE of 3.60%. Zou et al. prepared inverted structure PIDT-PhanQ:PC71BM devices with 2–3 nm GO as the HTL. With the usage of the GO modifier, the electron-blocking properties of the ITO electrode have been improved and the optimized OSCs based on this electrode showed a high PCE of 5.90%, which is superior to the performance of the control device based on PEDOT:PSS. Chris and colleagues using GO as the HTL for large-area (0.64 cm2) devices of PCDTBT:PC71BM, and obtained an excellent PCE of 5.00%. However, owing to the insulation of GO, the Rs of the above devices increased rapidly with the increased thickness of the GO HTL, leading to a rapid decline in PCE and difficult in printing production.
GO can be modified by partially reducing it (pr-GO) by chemical reduction, which will decrease the number of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of GO and increase the plane conjugation of GO. So far, this strategy has been considered to be an effective approach to improve the conductivity of GO. Yun et al. synthesized pr-GO through a chemical reaction between GO and p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (p-TSH), and obtained a conductivity of 1.64 S cm−1. The Jsc and PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM device using 5 nm pr-GO as the HTL were 9.33 mA cm−2 and 3.60%, respectively. By annealing of GO, Jeon's group acquired pr-GO with a conductivity of 1.8 S cm−1. With 3 nm pr-GO as the HTL, the PCE of the device was enhanced to 3.98% when using P3HT:PC61BM as the active layer. Moreover, the device showed excellent stability. The conductivity of pr-GO prepared via sulphuric acid chemical reduction of GO reported by Liu et al. was 1.3 S cm−1, and the PCE of P3HT:PC61BM devices using over 6 nm pr-GO as the HTL was 4.23%. By treating GO with 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylhydrazine, Kim et al. successfully synthesized pr-GO with a high conductivity of 3.5 S cm−1. When using the synthesized pr-GO as the HTL for a PTB7:PC71BM device, the Jsc was up to 14.84 mA cm−2, and the PCE reached a delightful value of 6.71%. Murray et al. got rid of partial oxygen groups on the surface of GO by treatment with UV–ozone, and the high conductivity of pr-GO boosted the PCE of the device to 7.39%. In particular, the thermal aging lifetime of the above pr-GO device was 5 times higher than that of PEDOT:PSS devices. The humid ambient lifetime was 20 times longer compared to that of PEDOT:PSS devices, showing excellent application potential. Xia et al. and Rafique et al. have also prepared high conductivity pr-GO by UV–ozone treatment as a HTL material for OSCs. Chen's group prepared high conductivity pr-GO by a chemical reduction of GO with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylhydrazine as a HTL material for PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices with a PCE of up to 6.60%.
Compared with PEDOT:PSS-modified devices, GO-modified devices exhibit higher PCE and stability. However, the low conductivity of GO immensely limits its wide application in OSCs. Due to the charge transport properties of GO depend strongly on their microstructure and composition, the research and development of new modification methods to improve the conductivity of GO has become the focus of attention (Table 3).

Cross-linkable materials are a rising star in the field of HTL materials and can be thermally or photochemically crosslinked to form a robust hole-transport film, showing better stability in the subsequent solvent treatment of the BHJ active layer. This characteristic gives them a unique advantage in the solution process of fabricated OSCs. Alexander et al. reported a kind of cross-linkable HTL material, TPDSi2:TFB blend (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. 4). Compared with PEDOT:PSS, TPDSi2:TFB has stronger electron-blocking performance and higher hole-transporting ability and transmittance. The PCE and thermal stability of TPDSi2:TFB-modified MDMO-PPV:PCBM devices were dramatically enhanced compared to those of PEDOT:PSS-modified devices. Hains et al. reported a cross-linkable HTL material, PABTSi2:TFB blend, with a higher HOMO level than TPDSi2:TFB. The PCE of P3HT:PC61BM devices with the PABTSi2:TFB HTL was 3.10%, which is comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS-modified devices under the same conditions. Sun et al. also reported a kind of cross-linkable HTL material, namely tetraphenyldiamine-containing (TPD-BVB). The P3HT:PC61BM devices fabricated with the TPD-BVB HTL exhibited comparable PCE and superior long-term air stability to the devices fabricated with PEDOT:PSS. Tsai et al. also reported a kind of cross-linkable HTL material, DVTPD. After heating at 180 °C for 30 minutes, DVTPD could be thermally cross-linked to form a solvent-resistant HTL, enabling the preparation of solution-treated OSCs. The hole collection and electron-blocking capability of DVTPD were also better than those of PEDOT:PSS. The PCE of PBDCPDTFBT:PC71BM devices using DVTPD as the HTL was 5.30%. Sun et al. reported another cross-linkable HTL material, IDT-BTPA. The electron-blocking capability of IDT-BTPA was better than that of PEDOT:PSS. Thus, simple and useful solution processed cross-linkable HTL materials are an attractive alternative to PEDOT:PSS as HTLs in OSCs. Sun et al. synthesized a kind of thermal cyclodimerization HTL material, triphenylamine-containing polyperfluorocyclobutane (TPA-PFCB). The energy levels of HOMO and LUMO are −5.2 eV and −1.7 eV, respectively. The insertion of a thin TPA-PFCB layer between ITO and P3HT:PC61BM can prevent the entry of electrons from the active layer into the ITO anode, thus enhancing the PCE of the devices. The discovery of cross-linkable HTL materials is expected to promote the development of new HTL materials for OSCs. Wang et al. used fluoro-alkyl and hydrogenated-alkyl phosphonic acid derivatives (FmSAM and HmSAM) as the HTL to modify ITO; it could form a self-assembled monolayer and induce a barrier of 2.4 eV for carrier transport, which effectively increases carrier selectivity at the ITO anode and increases the Voc (Table 4).

At present, the main challenge in the OSC field is realizing devices with both high PCE and long lifetime. In response to this challenge, great progress has been made in the design and development of new active layer materials, optimization of device structures, renewal of manufacturing processes, and advancement of interfacial engineering. This review mainly focuses on the capabilities of the HTL and its impact on the PCE and stability of OSCs. Meanwhile, this paper also summarizes a wide range of HTL materials, including conductive polymers, graphene oxides and other organic emerging materials. Although all of these HTL materials are potential candidates in OSCs, there is still a long way to go for these HTL materials to realize the commercialization of large-scale printing due to their shortcomings in electrical, optical, and chemical properties. Systematic research should be concentrated on the preparation and application of HTL materials for large-scale devices. Consequently, it is of great significance to explore a new type of HTL material to further understand and control the performance of the HTL material and promote the large-scale printing process of OSCs. To better integrate the high PCE and stability of the HTL with OSCs and promote the commercialization of OSCs, three issues should be deeply studied. Firstly, it's very important to investigate the mechanical behavior of HTL materials, which is crucial for large-scale and stretchable OSCs. Nevertheless, few efforts have been focused on it. Thus, large-area processing technology of HTL materials and the influence of the mechanical behavior of HTL materials on the performance of OSCs need to be urgently investigated. Secondly, it is quite essential to explore HTL materials with adjustable WF and conductivity. The WF and the conductivity of the HTL exert a profound influence on the PCE of OSCs. A HTL with adequate WF and conductivity can dramatically improve the selectivity and the efficiency of hole extraction and collection, reduce the interface energy barrier between anode and active layer, and facilitate the formation of an ohmic contact between the anode and active layer, which is beneficial to increase the PCE. Thirdly, developing HTL materials with adjustable adhesion is necessary. The HTL materials with adequate adhesion not only can form conformal contacts, but also can improve the adhesion between the electrode and active layer, and reduce thermally induced interfacial dewetting and delamination resulting from surface energy mismatches, which is decisive to enhance the stability of OSCs.

Although some problems still exist in the application of organic HTL materials, their solution-processing and flexible modification can provide wide scope for the development of OSCs. The coexistence of challenges and opportunities in this field suggests that with the innovation of organic HTL materials, OSCs with high PCE, long-term stability, and large-scale manufacturing will emerge in near future, and such OSCs possess excellent commercialization prospects.
