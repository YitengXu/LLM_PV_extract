Three conjugated random copolymers comprising benzodithiophene and thiophene as the donor units and benzooxadiazole as the acceptor unit, spaced with thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges, were designed and synthesized. The effects of different linkers on the optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. The polymer containing a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge revealed a red shifted absorption compared to its thiophene analogue. Morphological and photovoltaic properties of a polymer:fullerene blend film were investigated. The blend of one of the random copolymers (P2) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) revealed a photovoltaic performance efficiency of 5.17% due to the high short-circuit current density and fill factor.

Photovoltaics enable harvesting of energy directly from sunlight, hence they are considered as an important solution to the ever increasing demand for energy. In recent years, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have become very popular due to their low-cost, lightweight, flexibility, and solution processability. Among PSCs, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type PSCs have been widely studied, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased rapidly to 7–11% in single junction PSCs. In bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type PSCs, electron-donating conjugated polymers and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives are mixed together to form a bicontinuous interpenetrating network with a large interfacial area for efficient exciton dissociation. The development of new conjugated polymers which exhibit broad light absorption, high charge carrier mobility, suitable energy level matching with the electron acceptor (fullerene derivatives) provides the rapid enhancement of PCE. The main prerequisite to achieve high efficiency solar cells is a broad absorption of solar radiation by polymers. Since conjugated polymers have typically quite narrow absorption bands, only a small portion of the solar radiation is harvested. In order to broaden the absorption process several strategies were developed. The donor–acceptor strategy, which is the incorporation of electron poor and rich moieties into the polymer backbone, is one of the most effective strategies to develop new polymers with a reduced band gap and enhanced light harvesting. Generally, donor–acceptor configuration is the combination of electron rich donor and electron poor acceptor units. In 2010 Bo and coworkers synthesized alkoxy-substituted benzothiadiazole and [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline moieties as the acceptors and used the fluorene unit as the donor to obtain polymers with broader absorption in the solar spectrum. Combination of three units along the polymer chain did not give very high efficiencies in organic solar cells. This strategy allows the synthesis of narrow band gap polymers for efficient polymer solar cells. The terpolymer approach is the combination of two electron rich or electron poor building blocks with one electron poor or electron rich building block. This approach has been explored as a tool to control the optoelectronic properties of donor–acceptor type polymers. The three components in the main chain provide broadening of the absorption spectra, which can be more beneficial to harvest photons in photovoltaics. Another opportunity is to alter the molecular packing by introducing components that favor π–π stacking. In the literature, random copolymers based on the terpolymer approach revealed the broadening of the absorption spectrum. Li and coworkers synthesized a random copolymer with a broad absorption and they reported a high PCE over 5%. Moreover, McCulloch et al. also reported a random copolymer with 5% PCE. A semi-random copolymer having a very high current density over 16 mA cm−2 has also been reported by Thompson and coworkers. In random copolymers, spectral broadening of the energy levels stems from the various sections with different chemical composition which may result in the formation of trap sites. Some studies showed that random terpolymers predominate corresponding alternating copolymers. There is no any limitation to synthesize either random copolymers or regular polymers to obtain high performance solar cells at the moment. This inspired us to combine benzodithiophene, thiophene and benzooxadiazole units with different spacers to have extended absorption in the longer wavelengths with an increased device efficiency. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is one of the most employed fused-ring building blocks for the synthesis of semiconducting polymers. BDT allows the incorporation of substituents on the central benzene core, while also maintaining planarity of the two thiophene units. In addition, the symmetric nature of the BDT monomers eliminates the need to control the regioregularity during the polymerization process. Polymers comprising benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the electron donor tend to have promising photovoltaic properties. Its planar conjugated structure, regioregularity, easy modification and high hole mobility make benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) one of the most successful electron-donor units for the synthesis of semiconducting polymers. Moreover, the rigid coplanar structure of the BDT unit provides strong π–π intermolecular interactions, and also the ease of side chain addition results in soluble and processable polymers. BDT-based conjugated polymers gave high performance photovoltaic devices with PCBM acceptors since their symmetric structure could enhance the electron delocalization and interchain interaction. Conjugated polymers with different conjugated linkers have different optical, electrochemical, charge transport and photovoltaic properties. Conjugated linkers contribute to the π-electron density, increase the electronic interaction between the donor and acceptor units, and hence they affect the spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals over the polymer backbone. Vinylenes, ethylenes, thiophenes, furans and selenophenes are some examples of conjugated spacers in the literature. Lately, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene has gained much interest since such fused aromatic units provide enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking and charge mobility with a red shift in absorption and a lowered band gap. Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ensures a high delocalization of π-electrons over the polymer chain due to its symmetric, rigid and coplanar structure. For these reasons, this π-conjugated bridge has been successfully applied as a spacer in donor–acceptor polymers. 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BT) is one of the strongest acceptor moieties mostly used in PSCs. Its capability to adopt the quinoid structure in the polymer backbone results in a low-band gap and coplanar structure. On the other hand, 2,1,3-benzooxadiazole (BO) has a low-lying oxidation potential than its sulfur based counterpart. Polymers comprising benzooxadiazole have higher Voc values but provide lower PCEs, presumably due to the low molecular weight and low solubility of polymers. Introducing two octyloxy chains on the BO moiety allows the synthesis of highly soluble polymers which is crucial for purification and high-quality film formation with higher molecular weights.

In this study, benzodithiophene and thiophene were used as the donor and benzooxadiazole as the acceptor building blocks in the polymer chain bridged by different heteroaromatic rings as shown in Schemes 1 and 2. Thiophene and thienothiophene units were selected as the conjugated linkers. The effects of different conjugated linkers on the electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated.

Indium tin oxide (ITO) (Visiontek 15 ohm square−1) coated glass substrates were cleaned with toluene, detergent, water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath and dried with a N2 gun. After oxygen plasma treatment, poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevious P VP Al 4083) was spin-coated (3000 rpm) onto the ITO substrates. Right after baking at 130 °C for 15 min in air, the substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glove box. Polymer PC71BM blends were prepared in 1:1 to 1:3 ratio in dichlorobenzene (DCB). Blends were filtered through a 0.2 μm pore size PTFE filter. The thickness of the active layer was optimized by changing the concentration of the blend from 2% to 3% and controlling the spin coating speed. Active layer thicknesses were determined by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy). Lithium fluoride (0.6 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated on top of the active layer with an average deposition rate of 0.08 Å s−1 and 1 Å s−1, respectively. The active layer of the device was of 0.06 cm2. The current density voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of solar cell was determined using an Oriel Quantum Efficiency Measurement Kit. The calibrated silicon diode was used as the reference.


The electronic and optical properties of polymers play a crucial role in the application areas of polymers. Low oxidation potentials, low band gaps or a broad absorption spectrum are some of the requested qualifications for polymers for several applications especially in organic photovoltaics. Cyclic voltammetry is used to investigate the redox behaviors of polymers. It is performed via a three electrode system where the potential is scanned at a working electrode relative to a known reference electrode while recording the resulting current. The system has a potentiostat and a cell consisting of a silver wire as the reference electrode, an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass as the working electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode.

A solution of polymers with a 5 mg mL−1 concentration in a chloroform solvent was spray coated onto the working electrode using a spray gun. Cyclic voltammetry studies were performed in a 0.1 M NaClO4–LiClO4/ACN supporting electrolyte/solvent system with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Single scan cyclic voltammetry runs were performed in the range of −2.00 V/1.30 V for P1, −1.90 V/1.30 V for P2 and 0.00 V/1.75 V for P3, respectively. Corresponding oxidation/reduction potentials in the p-doped state were recorded as 1.15 V/0.75 V for P1, 0.90 V/0.80 V for P2 and 1.10 V/0.90 V for P3 (Table 1). Recently, the insertion of π-bridges between donor–acceptor units is a straightforward way in structural modifications of polymers which leads to enhancement of the electronic and optical properties of polymers. In this study, thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene linkages eliminate the torsion angle and allow the polymer to adopt a planar structure. By inserting spacers between A and D moieties polymers with lower band gaps can be obtained. As seen in Fig. 1, P2 has a lower oxidation potential than P1 as a consequence of more efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor–acceptor units through the thiophene unit. Trang et al. stated that as the number of thiophene rings in the polymer back bone increases oxidation potential of the polymers comprising the 2,1,3-benzooxadiazole unit decreases.

Although it seems that P3 has a higher oxidation peak than P1 and P2, it starts to get oxidized around 0.8 V and shows a broad redox behavior compared to P1 and P2. Thus, introducing the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit rather than thiophene as a π-linker enhances the ICT and doping/dedoping processes can be performed more easily. Due to its more rigid and fused structure, thienothiophene provides more π-electron delocalization on the polymer chain and higher charge mobilities. The oxidation potentials of P1 and P2 in the cathodic region cannot be observed clearly; however, they show a reversible color change during the redox processes. Cyclic voltammetry studies were also performed at different scan rates to prove electroactivity of polymer films (Fig. 2). This study also showed that polymers were well adhered to the working electrode. As the scan rate increases, the current response of the polymers increases as supported by the Randles–Sevcik equation. The linear dependence of the anodic/cathodic current peak as a function of the scan rate proves the non-diffusion controlled mass transfer during the redox processes. Scan rate studies of P1 could not be performed since it is not as stable as P2 and P3. Due to the lack of the π-bridge unit in P1, the intermolecular interactions between donor–acceptor units decrease. HOMO energy levels were calculated from the onset values of the oxidation potentials of the polymers from the cyclic voltammetry studies. NHE was taken as −4.75 eV against the vacuum level. Accordingly, the HOMO energy level was calculated using eqn (1).
HOMO = −(4.75 + Eonsetox) (eV)
(1)
HOMO energy levels were calculated as −5.55 eV, −5.35 eV and −5.15 eV while corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated as −3.73 eV, −3.58 eV and −3.43 eV for P
1, P2, and P3 respectively using optical band gap values as recorded by spectroelectrochemistry studies. P2 has a lower band gap compared to similar studies in the literature with benzodithiophene and benzooxadiazole units. Thus, it was shown that coupling of strong electron donor and acceptor units with efficient bridging agents can produce polymers with lower band gaps. HOMO energy levels of polymers increased as the electron transporting ability of the π-bridge unit increases. It was shown that the thienothiophene unit is richer in electron density compared to the thienyl substituent, and thienothiophene containing polymers show high lying HOMO energy levels compared to thiophene containing ones. Thus P3 has a higher HOMO energy level than P2 and P1 due to conjugation and charge transport between D–A units.


Spectroelectrochemical studies were performed to observe the optical properties of polymers such as maximum absorption wavelength of the neutral polymer film which is correlated with its neutral state color and used to calculate the optical band gaps of the polymers. Polaron/bipolaron bands formed are regarded as the charge carriers on the polymer backbone. In order to investigate the optical properties, polymers were dissolved in chloroform and then spray coated on the ITO coated glass electrode. All the experiments were performed in the 0.1 M NaClO4–LiClO4/ACN supporting electrolyte/solvent system. Starting from the neutral state, absorption spectra were scanned through the Visible-NIR region up to the most oxidized state of polymers by step wise increasing the potential. As shown in Fig. 3, P1 and P2 have absorption peaks around 350–400 nm in the visible range due to the π–π* transition in the conjugated polymer back bone. The maximum absorption bands of polymers were observed at around 610 nm with a 560 nm shoulder for P1, at around 560 nm for P2 and 520 nm for P3, which can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between benzodithiophene (donor) and benzooxadiazole (acceptor) segments. The neutral state colors of polymers were similar to each other, and they reveal λmax values in the visible region. The optical band gap of polymers was calculated using the onset value of these maximum absorption wavelengths which are 680 nm for P1, 700 nm for P2 and 720 nm for P3. Corresponding optical band gaps were calculated as 1.82 eV for P1, 1.77 eV for P2 and 1.72 eV for P3, respectively. Lower band gaps could be achieved via introducing stronger π-bridges into the polymer backbone. The optical properties of three polymers are summarized in Table 1. As seen from Fig. 3a, polaron/bipolaron band formation could not be observed clearly for P1 compared to P2 and P3. This might be due to the fact that the polymer cannot be fully oxidized as the neutral band could not be depleted completely via applying a higher potential than 1.0 V. Moreover, it can be explained by the structures of the polymers. As the conjugation of the backbone is increased via introducing thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene linkages into the chain, charge transport is increased through the polymer chain hence more clear polaron/bipolaron bands are formed (Fig. 3a). In addition, as seen from Fig. 3a the oxidation process of the neutral P1 is not complete since the band at 600 nm does not deplete completely. As to P2, the oxidation process is rather successful revealing polarons at 800 nm and bipolarons at ca. 1400 nm. Regarding P3, the oxidation process is almost complete yielding high intensity polarons and bipolarons. P1 and P2 exhibit a light blue color whereas P3 has a light purple color in their neutral states (Fig. 3b). Upon applied potential, polymers revealed a gray-transparent color in their oxidized states. For further characterization, colorimetry studies were performed and results were summarized in Table 2 according to the CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) standards. In CIE coordinates, L represents the luminescence (brightness) of a color, a represents the color between red/magenta and green, b represents the color between yellow and blue.

Kinetic studies were performed to investigate the percent transmittance change (ΔT%) and the switching time of the polymers. The switching time can be defined as the time required for switching between the two extreme states i.e. neutral and oxidized/reduced states of the polymer at a 95% optical contrast. The measurements were done between neutral and fully oxidized/reduced states by applying square-wave potential within a 5 s time interval at wavelengths in which maximum absorption values were obtained in Vis-NIR regions. The wavelengths for neutral, polaron and bipolaron regions were chosen from the spectroelectrochemical studies. Corresponding percent transmittance values were recorded as 10% at 560 nm, 6% at 800 nm and 24% at 1265 nm for P2 whereas P3 revealed an optical contrast of 27% at 520 nm and 17% 1230 nm for P3, respectively. The results of kinetic studies show the stability of polymers, their response to potential after several cycles and how fast they switch between two states. As seen from other studies P2 and P3 have enhanced properties compared to P1. Since P1 is not stable as P2 and P3 kinetic studies of P1 cannot be performed. The addition of π-bridges may lead to interchain spacing thus allowing improved ion diffusion and dopant insertion with better kinetic results. Results were calculated from Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 3.

The photovoltaic properties of P2 were investigated in BHJ solar cells with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. Active layers were obtained from DCB, in order to optimize the morphology of the active layer a high boiling point additive DIO (1,8-diiodooctane) was added. The polymer:PC71BM weight ratio was optimized between 1:1 and 1:3. 1:1 weight ratios with 3.0% weight concentration giving the highest efficiency. Device current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are depicted in Fig. 5 and photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. Without any post-treatment, the P2 incorporated device spin-coated from dichlorobenzene exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.48% with a JSC value of 8.88 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.79 V, a FF of 64%. 0.5 vol% DIO addition improved the device performance to 4.79% through a rise in current density. DIO dissolves PC71BM selectively hence PCBM can intercalate into the polymer rich domains, promoting the donor acceptor interfacial area, resulting in interpenetrated networks. Further optimizations in the DIO amount were carried out; 1.0 vol% DIO was found as the optimum amount. The use of 1.0 vol% DIO led to an improvement in PCE to 5.17% with an open circuit voltage of 0.79 V, a short-circuit current density of 10.24 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 64%.

The nanoscale morphologies of the active layers were investigated with AFM in tapping mode. Active layer root mean square roughnesses (rms) were determined as 1.97 nm and 2.60 nm for the active layers spin coated from dichlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene with 1.0% DIO, respectively. Upon evaporation of DIO, PC71BM molecules tend to aggregate near the top surface leading to an increase in roughness. For further understanding the active layer morphologies, TEM (transmission electron microscopy) analysis was carried out. Fibril-like domains with an enhanced donor acceptor interfacial area are seen in the TEM image of P2:PC71BM (1:1) films spin coated from dichlorobenzene with 1.0% DIO (Fig. 6).
By using the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) method, the ratio of the number of charges collected by electrodes to the number of incident photons was investigated. 57% IPCE was obtained at 530 nm for the best performance solar cell as depicted in Fig. 7.
P3 has very low solubility in common solvents due to its high molecular weight, therefore device construction of this polymer could not be achieved. For the ease of device construction, monomers possessing solubilizing alkoxy chains were used to synthesize random copolymers. However, P1 has no π bridge between the donor and acceptor moieties and the alkyl chains may lead to a very low interaction between PC71BM and the polymer. This may as well be the reason for not getting proper film coating on the substrate. Therefore, we could not obtain an I–V curve for the devices using this polymer.

2,1,3-Benzooxadiazole, thiophene and benzodithiophene based random copolymers were synthesized via a Stille polycondensation reaction. Thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene were used as the π-conjugated linkers. P1 and P2 exhibit a light blue color whereas P3 has a light purple color in its neutral states. P1 has an optical band gap of 1.82 eV whereas optical band gaps of P2 and P3 are 1.77 eV and 1.72 eV, respectively. Incorporation of conjugated linkers into the polymer backbone allowed us to obtain lower band gap polymers due to an increase in the π-electron density. Without any post-treatment, the blend of P2 and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) exhibited a value of PCE of 4.48% with a Jsc value of 8.88 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.79 V, a FF of 64% under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The addition of DIO improved the device performance to 5.17% through a rise in current density. As stated in the Photovoltaic studies section, photovoltaic characteristic evaluations for P1 and P3 could not be done. For further studies, P3 will be synthesized with a lower molecular weight, solar cells based on this polymer will be constructed.
