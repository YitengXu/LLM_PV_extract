FAPbI3 perovskite is an ideal candidate for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, attaining photoactive α-phase FAPbI3 under humid conditions is rather difficult due to the structural and moisture instability of α-phase FAPbI3. To obtain high quality α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite in ambient air, a strategy of incorporating methylamine thiocyanate (MASCN) as a stabilizer is introduced in this study. Due to its close effective ionic radius to I−, SCN− is successfully incorporated into the lattice. The strong bond between SCN− and Pb2+ and the strong hydrogen bonds between the N atom in SCN− and FA+ lead to a high quality and stable α-phase FA-based perovskite at ambient 50 ± 5% RH even at room temperature. With this high quality film, air-processed PSCs with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.06% can be realized in a p–i–n device. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that the stronger chemical bonding interaction between SCN− and Pb2+ as well as the stronger hydrogen bonds between SCN− and organic groups also improve the stability of PSCs. More than 90% of the initial efficiency is retained after 2000 hours of operation with maximum power point tracking under full sunlight illumination without an ultraviolet filter.

Metallic halide perovskites with a general formula ABX3, where A = CH3NH3+ (MA+), HC(NH2)2+ (FA+), and Cs, B = Pb2+, and Sn2+, and X = I−, Br−, and Cl−, have attracted a considerable amount of attention due to their high photovoltaic performance and the tremendous advance in stability. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high efficiency are usually fabricated in a glovebox under inert conditions or a low-humidity atmosphere (relative humidity < 30%) to avoid the adverse impact of humidity in the film formation process. Such an environment can only be achieved by using a sophisticated air/humidity-controlling system and inevitably increases the capital costs of setting up the fabrication facilities, which is not desired for mass production. In order to promote the commercialization of PSCs, air-processed perovskites that allow perovskite fabrication under ambient conditions without the strict control of environmental humidity have attracted considerable attention because of its compatibility with state-of-the-art large-scale fabrication such as slot-die coating, doctor blading, spray coating,etc. However, the device performance of PSCs prepared in air is still inferior to that prepared in a glove box, which is due to the adverse effects of moisture on the crystallization process of the perovskite films. For example, water molecules can bind with PbI2 to form lead complexes and lead to uncontrolled growth of lager 1D intermediates, which leads to incomplete coverage films. The hygroscopic perovskite precursor solution can adsorb moisture in a humid environment, which prolonged the evaporation of solvents and delayed the supersaturation of the solution. The reduced supersaturation induced low nucleation density and a large critical nucleus radius, resulting in an isolated perovskite crystal. In our previous work, we adopted an anti-solvent bathing method to solve the problem of incomplete coverage films in air. At the same time, it was found that the moisture in air affected not only the morphology of the film, but also the composition. The Cl ion preferred to remain in the perovskite film when fabricated in ambient air compared to that in a glovebox.

At present, a MA-based perovskite is widely used for the air-processed perovskite under high humidity (RH > 40%), where MA+ is dominant in the A site. Nevertheless, the MA-based perovskite is reported to be unstable against light and heat due to its low formation energy. Replacing the MA+ by FA+ to form the FAPbI3 perovskite achieved better photo-thermal stability and a lower bandgap that is closer to the optimum bandgap for a single junction solar cell derived from the Shockley–Queisser limit. Thus, FAPbI3 perovskite could be an ideal candidate for efficient and stable PSCs. Unfortunately, attaining photoactive α-phase FAPbI3 under humid conditions is rather difficult due to the structural and moisture instability of α-phase FAPbI3. The preparation of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite in air with high RH is rarely reported. Recently, Wang et al. succeeded in fabricating PSCs by using α-phase FAPbI3 as the light absorber under an elevated RH level of 40% and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.29%. They used N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as an additive into the FAPbI3 precursor and they found that NMP assists in reducing the crystallization rate by forming an FAI–PbI2–NMP intermediate. In the annealing stage, NMP is rapidly detached from the intermediate phase, which leads to the conversion from an intermediate to α-phase FAPbI3 while avoiding the conversion route from an indirect δ-phase to the α-phase, which could leave δ-phase residues in the film. Alternatively, to fabricate α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite at a high humidity level with a simpler procedure, the photoactive α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite at room temperature must be stabilized. This objective is realizable by partially substituting FA+ with MA+ or Cs+ (ref. 21 and 22) to create a double- or triple-cation perovskite and alternatively substituting I− with Br− or Cl− to create a double anion perovskite. A preliminary study by Miyasaka et al. confirmed that PSCs utilizing a double-cation/double-anion perovskite {(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15} as the light absorber can still provide a reasonably high PCE that reaches 15.7% when fabricated at 40% RH. Cs+ incorporation can also stabilize the α-phase FAPbI3 at high humidity, which was pioneered by Xu et al. The PSCs fabricated at 70% RH showed a PCE of 15.56% with improved thermal stability and moisture resistance. This performance was achieved by Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite obtained through two-step spin-coating in which hot FAI solution was added dropwise onto a preheated PbI2–CsI0.15–FAI0.3 complex substrate. Considering the hygroscopicity of FAI, preheating the solution and substrate can remove moisture ingress from the growing perovskite layer during the spin-coating process.
Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in stabilizing α-phase FA-based perovskites. Enhancing hydrogen bonding between organic ammonium cations and [PbI6]4− octahedra has been shown to be an effective strategy to stabilize α-phase FA-based perovskite. For example, partially replacing the FA+ with the stronger dipole moment MA+ can enhance the hydrogen bonding between the organic ammonium cation and [PbI6]4− octahedron, thus stabilizing the 3D arrangement of the [PbI6]4− octahedron with a pseudo-cubic symmetry. Water in air is prone to bond with the Pb atom, which weakens the hydrogen bonding between the organic ammonium cation and [PbI6]4− octahedron, resulting in the formation of an δ-phase in a humid environment. Therefore, reducing the bonding of water molecules with lead and enhancing the hydrogen bonding between organic ammonium cations and octahedrons are the key to obtaining a high quality α-phase FA-based perovskite in air.
In this work, methylamine thiocyanate (MASCN) is introduced to stabilize α-phase FA-based perovskite in ambient air. SCN− has an effective ionic radii of about 217 pm, which is very close to that of the iodine's effective ionic radii of 220 pm. Therefore, SCN− is expected to substitute a fraction of iodine atoms in the perovskite lattice. Comparing the spherical shape of I− with the linear shape of SCN− from their Lewis structures, the lone pairs of electrons from S and N atoms in SCN− can interact strongly with Pb2+ and N atoms can form strong hydrogen bonds with FA+, which will stabilize the frame structure of the perovskite even under a moist environment. Under optimized conditions, the PSCs with a planar p–i–n structure obtain a maximum PCE of 19.06% and show superior stability. Under full sunlight illumination without an ultraviolet filter, the corresponding devices maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000 hours of operation.

We prepared the perovskite films using a modified two-step method similar to our previous work in ambient air at 50 ± 5% RH. Firstly, PbI2 dissolved in DMF and DMSO mixed solvent was spin on a substrate for 4 s to get a transparent intermediate phase film. This film was dipped into IPA anti-solvent to product a smooth and fully covered PbI2 film. Secondly, FAI with different stabilizers dissolved in IPA solvent was spin coated on the prepared PbI2 film to form a FA-based perovskite film. Here, we used MA+ as the cation of stabilizers because of its larger dipole moment and stronger interaction with [PbI6]4− octahedrons, which can stabilize the 3D arrangement of α-phase FAPbI3. We adjusted the type and content of anions to further enhance the interaction between the organic ammonium cation and octahedrons so that α-phase FAPbI3 can be stabilized under ambient conditions. The mole ratio of MA+ and FA+ is maintained at 24:76 and I− will be partially substituted by SCN−. For the control sample, MA+ is originated from MAI (regarded as 0 MASCN). For the target sample, 50 mol% MAI is replaced by MASCN (regarded as 50 MASCN). It has been demonstrated that the edges of the band-gap are mainly occupied by inorganic matrices rather than organic cations, where the organic cations act to maintain charge neutrality and the band gap closely depends on the angle of inorganic metal-halide bonds. However, the size of organic cations plays an important role in the expansion or contraction of the whole lattice arising from the substitution doping of large or small organic cations. Replacing the large size FA+ cation with the small size MA+ cation will increase the band gap (1.48 eV for FAPbI3 and 1.57 eV for MAPbI3). Then, the bandgap of the alloyed MA+ and FA+ in the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite should be between 1.48 eV and 1.57 eV. Based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, Chang et al. found that the more FA+ doping into the lattice is, the narrower the bandgap is. Thus, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission of the film with more FA+ will red shift, otherwise it will blue shift. However, there is one case that does not conform to this rule, that is, x = 0.5 and the direction of FA+ doping is along with the crystal plane [110]. In this case, the perovskite bandgap is even larger than that of pure MAPbI3 perovskite. Based on the above analysis, we recorded the PL emission spectra of an unannealed perovskite film to evaluate the degree of FA+ incorporation into the lattice. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the PL emission peak of the 0 MASCN sample is located at 788 nm, which is very close to the emission of pure MAPbI3 (775–780 nm), indicating that the organic cations that participated in the formation of the perovskite are mainly MA+. FA+ is not well incorporated into the lattice. According to the 2theta of 11.2° from X-ray diffraction (XRD) results in Fig. 1(b) that corresponds to δ-phase FAPbI3, FA+ is involved in the formation of the δ-phase rather than the α-phase. To further prove that the formation of the δ-phase is mainly ascribed to the influence of water molecules in ambient air, we eliminated this influence by completing the whole preparation process in a glovebox with a water amount less than 0.1 ppm. The corresponding film shows PL emission at 796 nm, as shown in Fig. S1. Meanwhile, the XRD pattern in Fig. S2 shows the disappearance of the δ-phase, indicating that more FA+ is incorporated into the lattice and water molecules are the main cause of the δ-phase in the mixed MA+ and FA+ perovskite. Surprisingly, when 50 mol% MAI is replaced by MASCN, the perovskite film prepared in the same air environment (50 ± 5% RH) shows the emission peak of 819 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(a), indicating that a large amount of FA+ is involved in the formation of the 3D perovskite. The XRD in Fig. 1(b) also shows the disappearance of the δ-phase, and the significant increase of (110), which corresponds to a 2theta value of about 13.9°, further demonstrating that MASCN has successfully stabilized the α-phase FA-based perovskite under ambient conditions at room temperature. The entire process of perovskite formation is summarized in Fig. 1(c). The precursor which contains MAI and FAI would separate into MA-based perovskite and δ-phase FAPbI3 when fabricated in ambient air because of the low formation energy of MAPbI3 (ref. 11 and 12) and the strong coordination ability of water to lead atoms, which interferes with the hydrogen bond between FA+ and I− and produces the more energy stable δ-phase. When the perovskite is fabricated in a glovebox with a N2 atmosphere to avoid the influence of water molecules, the δ-phase disappears and more FA+ is incorporate into the perovskite lattice. Surprisingly, the introduction of MASCN can greatly enable FA+ to enter the perovskite lattice even in a moist environment. Such an impact can be ascribed to the stronger ionic interaction between SCN− and Pb2+ than that between I− and Pb2+, which reduces the coordination ability of water to lead compounds, thus reducing the effect of water on hydrogen bonding between the inorganic octahedron and organic ammonium cation. What's more, strong hydrogen bonds are also formed between SCN− and FA+, further enhancing the 3D framework of the perovskite. Fig. 1(d) shows the XRD patterns of the films after the thermal annealing treatment. There is still a small amount of δ-phase perovskite in the 0 MASCN sample, but not in the 50 MASCN sample, indicating that the transition from the δ-phase to the α-phase is not complete in the thermal annealing process, so it is necessary to stabilize the α-phase at room temperature. Furthermore, the 50 MASCN sample shows the strengthening of the (110) peak from 2382 cps to 3436 cps and the narrowing of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak from 0.28° to 0.23° compared to the 0 MASCN sample, indicating the improved crystallinity of the perovskite film.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were further employed to investigate the coordination interaction between SCN− and Pb2+ and the strong hydrogen bond between SCN− and FA+, which are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c). In order to eliminate the influence of solvent, the films were treated by thermal annealing in advance. Although the evaporation temperature of MASCN is as low as 92.4 °C, which is assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and shown in Fig. S3, we find that SCN− can still exist in the film after 150 °C annealing by comparing the FT-IR of the film with that of MASCN powder. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the 50 MASCN sample shows a 2066 cm−1 wavenumber corresponding to the stretching vibration of SCN−, as compared to pure MASCN powder with the stretching vibration of SCN− at 2048 cm−1. The existence of SCN− in the 50 MASCN sample and the shift of its peak to a higher wavenumber indicate that SCN− should be incorporated into the perovskite lattice. As seen from Fig. 2(c), the shift of Pb 4f peaks from XPS results further reveals the existence of SCN− strong binding with Pb2+. For the 0 MASCN sample, the peaks at 143.0 eV and 138.2 eV correspond to Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2, respectively, and they shift to 143.3 eV and 138.4 eV in the 50 MASCN sample, which is originated from the strong binding of Pb2+ and SCN−. The electron cloud on Pb2+ is biased towards SCN−, weakening the shield and increasing the binding energy. In addition, from the FT-IR pattern in Fig. 2(a), the absorption at 3264 cm−1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of the N–H bond in the 0 MASCN sample, while it shifts to 3260 cm−1 in the 50 MASCN sample. We attribute this shift to the formation of stronger hydrogen bonds N–H⋯N between SCN− and FA+ than N–H⋯I. This hydrogen bond results in a delocalization of the electronic cloud of the N–H bond, which weakens the N–H chemical bond and decreases the corresponding vibrational frequency.
To further verify whether the SCN− replaces the I− and incorporates into the lattice or not, optical properties are carefully investigated by a range of techniques with different x mol% MASCN (abbreviated as x MASCN) that replaces the same mole of MAI in films, where x = 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100, respectively. From the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and PL spectra in Fig. 2(d), the blue-shifts of both the absorption edge and emission are observed with the increased amount of MASCN. By adopting the Tauc calculation method:
αhν = K(hν − Eg)n
where
α is the optical absorption coefficient, K is a constant, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light, Eg is the optical band gap, and the exponent n characterizes the nature of the electron transition, which can be assigned to 1/2 because of the direct bandgap semiconductor nature of the perovskite. The bandgap of the perovskite increases from 1.53 eV to 1.56 eV with the increase of MASCN from 0 mol% to 100 mol%, as shown in Fig. S4(a)–(e). The increase of the bandgap clearly indicates that I− is partly replaced by SCN− with a smaller ionic radius, which further demonstrates the incorporation of smaller SCN− in the perovskite lattice and the corresponding crystal structure is illustrated in Fig. 2(e), in which SCN− connects adjacent Pb2+ by S and N bonds, respectively.

In general, when the composition or coating process of perovskite thin films is changed, the surface morphology may change and in turn change the device performance. Therefore, the surface morphology in FA-based perovskite with different amounts of MASCN is investigated using top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 0 MASCN and 50 MASCN samples are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. 25 MASCN, 75 MASCN and 100 MASCN samples are shown in Fig. S5(a), (b) and (c), respectively. The grain sizes of perovskite films are closely related to the amount of the incorporated MASCN. The grain size obtained from 0 MASCN is approximately 290 nm in average. 25 MASCN produces a film with a larger grain size of 574 nm. The grain size obtained from 50 MASCN is 943 nm. However, 75 MASCN decreases the grain size to 825 nm, and 100 MASCN further decreases it to 548 nm, indicating that the optimum concentration of MASCN should be 50 mol%. The cross-sectional SEM images of 0 MASCN and 50 MASCN films deposited on an ITO/PTAA substrate are also shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively. ITO is indium tin oxide and PTAA is poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]. A perovskite film with a rough surface is constructed by compactly packing random small crystalline grains in 0 MASCN. However, the perovskite film with 50 MASCN shows single grains throughout the whole film, which is beneficial to the fast transport of charge carriers.
The blue shift of PL emission, high crystallinity, large grain size and fewer grain boundaries are always accompanied by the reduction of trap density, which is proved by our time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement as shown in Fig. 4(a). In this measurement, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) under low intensity pulsed excitation was used, for which the decay dynamics mostly reflect the nonradiative trap assisted recombination. The carrier lifetime values are obtained by using the biexponential equation:
Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)
where
A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes, and τ1 and τ2 denote the fast and slow decay times, which are related to the trap-assisted nonradiative and radiative recombination processes, respectively. The fitting carrier lifetime can be seen in Table S1, and both τ1 and τ2 of the perovskite film with MASCN as a stabilizer are longer than those of the perovskite film with only MAI. The increased lifetimes are consistent with the suppressed nonradiative recombination by reducing the number of trap states.

We further investigated the performance of the corresponding PSCs. All PSCs were fabricated using the configuration of ITO/PTAA/perovskite/C60/BCP/Cu, as shown in Fig. 4(b). C60 is buckminsterfullerene and BCP is bathocuproine. Fig. 4(c) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the best PSCs with different amounts of MASCN. 14.39%, 16.76%, 19.06%, 18.06%, and 16.11% PCE was obtained from 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 MASCN devices, respectively. This result also demonstrates that 50 MASCN is the optimum concentration. The detailed parameters are shown in Table 1. Specifically, the 50 MASCN device shows a 19.06% PCE with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.08 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.04 V, and fill factor (FF) of 76.24%. This device also exhibits negligible hysteresis under both forward scan from 0 V to 1.2 V and reverse scan from 1.2 V to 0 V, in which the forward scan shows a PCE of 18.56% and the reverse scan shows a PCE of 19.06%, as shown in Fig. S6. The details on the reproducibility of this method are provided in Fig. S7. We fabricated 10 devices for each condition and all the PSCs show a narrow distribution of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE, further demonstrating the reliability of our preparation method. In addition, we fabricated perovskites under different RH conditions, and the corresponding device performances are shown in Fig. S8. The 50 ± 5% RH device shows the highest PCE, demonstrating that 50 ± 5% RH is the most suitable environment for the growth of a MASCN modified α-phase FA-based perovskite. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the PSCs fabricated with different amounts of MASCN are shown in Fig. 4(d). A strong absorption from 300 nm to 850 nm is observed, and the spectral response shows a slightly blue-shifted cut-off with the increase of MASCN, which is consistent with the blue-shift of absorption and PL spectra shown in Fig. 3(a) due to the incorporation of SCN− into the lattice. The calculated JSC values from EQEs are 22.63 mA cm−2, 23.02 mA cm−2, 23.48 mA cm−2, 22.78 mA cm−2 and 22.31 mA cm−2 for 0 MASCN, 25 MASCN, 50 MASCN, 75 MASCN and 100 MASCN devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with the JSC derived from J–V curves.

We also measured the photostability of the devices and the thermal stability of the perovskite powder. The 0 MASCN and 50 MASCN devices were under one sun illumination without an ultraviolet filter and a voltage was applied at the maximum power output, and then the current density was recorded every ten minutes. The room temperature is about 25 °C, but the surface temperature of our devices is 46–47 °C, as shown by the temperature measurement in Fig. S9. As given in Fig. 5(a), the 50 MASCN device can maintain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 2000 hours of operation. However, the 0 MASCN device only kept 68% of the initial efficiency after 294 hours. The J–V curves and parameters of the initial device and the aging device are shown in Fig. S10. The significant enhancement of the light stability is attributed to the strong binding of Pb2+ and SCN− and strong hydrogen bonding between SCN− and FA+. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the perovskite powder was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TG). As shown in Fig. 5(b), 0 MASCN perovskite powder loses its 5% mass ratio only at 162 °C, while 50 MASCN perovskite powder loses its 5% mass ratio at 270 °C. The above results demonstrate that the introduction of SCN− can improve both the photo- and thermodynamic stability.

Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.8%), formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.8%) and PTAA (Mn = 3200 and Mw = 4900) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp (China). Methylamine thiocyanate (MASCN, >97%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI). Bathocuproine (BCP, 99.9%) and buckminsterfullerene (C60, 99%) were purchased from OLED Material Tech Co., Ltd (China). N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.8%), isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%), ethyl alcohol (99.5%) and chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Acros Ltd.


PTAA was dissolved in chlorobenzene (1.5 mg mL−1) and then stirred for 30 min at room temperature. PbI2 (1.36 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v, 1 mL) and stirred at 75 °C for a whole night to get a clean solution. FAI (0.234 mmol), MAI (0.074–x mmol), and MASCN (x mmol) (x = 0, 0.0185, 0.037, 0.0555, and 0.074 corresponding to 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mol% MASCN respectively) were dissolved in ethyl alcohol (1 mL), and extra acetonitrile (8 μL) was added into the solution.


Pre-patterned ITO substrates were cleaned via sequential sonication with diluted detergent, deionized water, acetone, and IPA for 20 min each and then baked at 120 °C in an oven for 30 min. The as-cleaned ITO substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 15 min. The preparation of the hole transport layer and perovskite layer was accomplished in ambient air with 50 ± 5% RH. PTAA solution was spin coated onto the prepared ITO glass at 6000 rpm (with a ramp rate of 2000 rpm s−1) for 30 s, and then heated at 120 °C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature. To obtain a uniform and fully covered PbI2 thin film under ambient conditions, PbI2 solution was spun on the PTAA substrate for only 4 s with a ramp rate of 1000 rpm s−1 and the spinning was stopped as soon as 4000 rpm was reached. The formed transparent liquid films were quickly dipped into IPA solution and bathed for about 12 s to ensure complete crystallization. After bathing, the films were blown-dry by using an air gun. After mixing the solution (280 μL) with FAI, MAI and MASCN at different ratios were added dropwise at the centre of the substrates and spun at 4000 rpm with a ramp rate of 1000 rpm s−1 for 3 min. After complete reaction, the films were transferred to a hot plate at 150 °C for 40 s, and then transferred to a 120 °C hot plate for another 12 min. Finally, the prepared films were transferred into a vacuum chamber. C60 (30 nm)/BCP (7 nm) were successively thermally evaporated in the vacuum chamber with a base pressure of <1 × 10−4 Pa. Subsequently, a metal electrode of 100 nm Cu was thermally evaporated through a metal shadow mask with an aperture area of 8 mm2.


The infrared spectrum test was performed on an FTIR-650. The perovskite powder was obtained from films and sampled by the potassium bromide tablet method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a K-ALPHA+ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using monochromated Al Kα (hν = 1486.68 eV) to produce radiation. The measurement pressure was 3.0 × 10−9 torr and the charge was calibrated with C 1s (284.8 eV). The XPS core-level spectra were collected using a step size of 0.1 eV and pass energy of 50 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a ZEISS Merlin. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was characterized by using a D8 Bruker equipped with a ceramic tube (Cu anode, λ = 1.54060 Å). The photoluminescence spectra were obtained using a Fluorolog 322 (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ltd) in the range of wavelengths from 620 nm to 850 nm by exciting at 460 nm. The samples were mounted at 60° and the emission was recorded at 90° from the incident beam path. The time-resolved PL decays were recorded by using an FLS980 steady-state/transient fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh). The pump light wavelength was 442 nm and the probe light wavelength was 810 nm. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under AM 1.5 G one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination from a Model XES-300T1 (SAN-EI ELECTRIC), which was simulated by using a solar simulator and recorded by using a PGSTAT302N Autolab. The current–voltage data were obtained by applying an external voltage bias and the current response was measured with a digital source meter 2636B SYSTEM (KEITHLEY). The light intensity was adjusted by the means of a Newport-calibrated monocrystalline Si solar cell equipped with a BK7 filter. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1. The devices were covered with a black and non-reflective metal mask with an aperture area of 4.18 mm2. The light soaking stability was tested under one sun (100 mW cm−2) continue illumination without an optical filter at the maximum power point. The currents were recorded by using a digital source meter 2636B SYSTEM (KEITHLEY). All the photovoltaic measurements were conducted under ambient air conditions. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an EQE system (PV measurement). The monochromatic beam was generated from a 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO) and used to acquire the spectrum from 300 to 850 nm. The UV-vis measurements were recorded using a UV/Vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600) in the 500–900 nm range. The thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a TGA-601 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25 °C to 500 °C.


It is known that water molecules in ambient air hinder the formation of α-phase FA-based perovskites and promotes the formation of the δ-phase at room temperature. To fabricate high-quality α-phase FA-based perovskites in ambient air (50 ± 5% RH), we introduced MASCN as an effective stabilizer and found that SCN− can be doped into the perovskite lattice. Due to the strong bonding of SCN− with Pb2+ and the hydrogen bond between SCN− and FA+, α-phase FA-based perovskites can be obtained in ambient air even without annealing. Impressively, the optimized perovskite solar cells show a PCE as high as 19.05%, which is much higher than the maximum PCE of 14.39% of the device without MASCN. Moreover, the perovskite devices with MASCN exhibit an excellent photo- and thermal stability. The encapsulated devices maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000 hours of illumination under one sun at 46–47 °C and the perovskite powder keeps 95% of its initial mass at 270 °C.
