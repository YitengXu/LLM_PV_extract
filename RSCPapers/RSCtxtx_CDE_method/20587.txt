A series of solution processable conjugated polymers containing the benzotriazole unit have been synthesized and studied. The benzotriazole unit can be considered a moderately electron deficient building block that can readily incorporate a convenient alkyl substituent for solution processability. By varying the electron accepting strength of co-monomer partners, a series of polymers with different photophysical properties were obtained. Some polymers exhibit relatively high fluorescence quantum yields while others were able to quench the fluorescence of electron donor polymers in blends consistent with their ability to act as electron acceptors. The performance of these polymers as the active material in organic light emitting diode (OLED) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is reported.

Optoelectronic and electronic devices with organic semiconductors as active materials, such as in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), have received great attention both in academic research and the electronics industry in recent years. Combining the mechanical properties of plastics and optoelectronic performance of inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors provide unique opportunities that are now being realised in consumer electronic devices. Thanks to the amenability of polymers for solution-based processing, polymeric semiconductors are attractive materials, which opens the possibility of large area fabrication of electronic devices at minimal cost. Interestingly, most research efforts have been focused on developing electron donor materials mainly because of their ease of synthesis and more robust ambient properties. There are relatively few examples of electron acceptor polymers described in the literature. The application of electron acceptor polymers in OPV devices has only achieved limited success.

Benzotriazole is a moderately electron-deficient unit due to the diimine structure and can be easily modified with solubilising alkyl groups at one of the nitrogen atoms on the triazole unit. This makes it an attractive building block for achieving solution processable polymers. Since the first synthesis of the benzotriazole polymer by Tanimoto and Yamamoto, benzotriazole-based polymers have been used in electrochromics, OLED, OPV, and OFET applications. Recently, an electron deficient polymer consisting of alternating benzotriazole and benzothiadiazole units has been reported. This polymer has been shown to exhibit an electron acceptor character and moderate performance as the electron transport material in OPV devices. In the present study, we describe the synthesis and properties of a series of electron deficient polymers P1–P4 based on the benzotriazole building block (Scheme 1). By varying the electron accepting character of the co-monomer units, changes in the photophysical and semiconducting properties of the polymers were observed. The performance of these polymers as the active materials in OLED and OPV devices are reported.

Polymers P1–P3 were synthesised through Suzuki–Miyaura polycondensation of known building blocks (Scheme 1). It should be noted that polymer P2 has been reported previously and was prepared for comparison with the other polymers in this study. The benzotriazole bis(trifluoroborate) unit 1 has been shown to be a stable and easily purified boronic acid precursor for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions. Coupling of 1 with dibromo-benzotriazole 2 gave poly(benzotriazole) P1 in near quantitative yield while reactions of 2 with dibromobenzothiadiazole 3 and dibromoquinoxaline 4 gave polymers P2 and P3 in 87% and 93% yield respectively (Scheme 1). Polymer P4 was synthesised by the Stille coupling of bis(trimethyltin) derivative 5 and dibromobenzobisthiadiazole 6 (Scheme 1). It is interesting to note that the benzobisthiadiazole monomer 6 is sensitive to base and is therefore unsuitable for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions. Polymerisation was achieved under microwave heating and a blue polymer was isolated in 73% yield. All polymers were appropriately endcapped and were purified by Soxhlet extraction.

The molecular weight of the polymers was determined using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in toluene at room temperature calibrated against polystyrene standards. A good molecular weight range was obtained for polymers P1–P3 (Table 1). Polymer P4 was of low molecular weight and can be considered oligomeric. Thermal properties of the polymers were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers show high decomposition temperatures >350 °C as observed from the TGA analysis (Table 1). No significant thermal transitions were seen in DSC analysis.

The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the polymers in chloroform solution is shown in Fig. 1a. There is a clear bathochromic shift in the absorption maximum with increasing electron deficiency of the co-monomers when comparing polymers P1, P2 and P4 (Fig. 1a). Although the benzotriazole unit is often considered a moderately electron deficient unit, the use of more electron deficient benzothiadiazole and benzo-bisthiadiazole co-monomers changed the role of benzotriazole into a weak electron donor unit. Interestingly, the absorption maximum of P3 is blue shifted relative to the benzotriazole homopolymer P1 even though the quinoxaline co-monomer unit is more electron deficient than benzotriazole. One possible reason for this observation is the increased distortion between the adjacent six-membered rings of the quinoxaline and the benzotriazole unit. Moreover, steric hindrance of the more bulky quinoxaline units would force the adjacent rings to twist out of plane decreasing the degree of π-conjugation along the polymer backbone. A twisted configuration within the polymer chain has been shown previously to increase the gap between the two frontier orbitals. The thin film absorption profile of polymers P1–P3 was red-shifted compared to their solution spectrum. The most prominent change was observed for homopolymer P1 with the emergence of a vibronic shoulder structure in the thin film spectrum (Fig. 1b). The structured absorption in thin films for P1 could arise from the polymer chromophores adopting a uniform highly planarized arrangement. The optical energy gap was determined from the onset of absorption in solution (Table 2). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the polymer films was determined using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA). PESA provides an interesting alternative to cyclic voltammetry and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in determining the HOMO of polymer films in an ambient environment. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was calculated using the HOMO energy level and optical energy gap (Table 2). It should be noted that the polymers were also examined using electrochemical techniques. However, the measurements suffered from film delamination and low response issues and were not reliable. Interestingly, the HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers did not vary significantly compared to the LUMO energy levels (Table 2). This behaviour has been observed in several donor–acceptor (D–A) type polymers and electron acceptor polymers, wherein changing the acceptor does not shift the HOMO energy level strongly. The opposite is true for the LUMO energy levels of the polymers. The electron withdrawing groups, benzothiadiazole and benzobisthiadiazole, shifted the LUMO considerably compared to the quinoxaline.

Strong photoluminescence was observed for polymers P1–P3 (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Solution emission maxima of 541, 604 and 486 nm were recorded for P1, P2 and P3 respectively. The thin film PL spectrum of polymers P1–P3 was slightly red-shifted compared to their solution spectra (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Only very weak emission was observed for polymer P4 in solution while no PL response was detected for the thin film sample. It is interesting to note some vibronic structure in the spectra for polymers P1 and P2. Similar structured emission spectra have been observed for phenylene–vinylene polymers and attributed to fluorescence from low energy planar chromophore segments.
Fluorescence lifetimes of the polymers in solution were determined using time-correlated single photon counting. The fluorescence quantum yields (φf) and lifetimes (τf) of polymers P1–P3 are provided in Table 2. The rates of radiative (kf) and non-radiative (knr) decay were determined from the φf and τf data using the relationships kf = φf/τf and knr = (1 − φf)/τf. The relatively high quantum yields suggest that the polymers are potential electroluminescent materials in OLED devices. While the fluorescence decay data for P1 and P2 gave good single exponential fits to yield a single lifetime, the P3 decay was found to better fitted by a double-exponential function yielding lifetimes of 0.52 ns and 1.04 ns with relative initial intensities of 85% and 15%, respectively. It is possible that the longer-lived minor component arises from defects in the polymer. In this case, a weighted average lifetime was used to calculate the rate constant data presented in Table 2.
Energy transfer is one of the key processes in organic conjugated materials used in OLED and OPV devices. In the case of an OLED, efficient energy transfer in polymer–polymer blends leads to enhanced EL quantum efficiency. For OPV devices, excitons are usually required to migrate to the donor–acceptor interface to allow formation of charge carrier species. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells require short exciton diffusion lengths to allow dissociation of excitons before radiative relaxation occurs. The work by Yu and Heeger demonstrated that when two conjugated polymers with offset energy levels were blended together the photoluminescence of each of the polymers was quenched. This implies that the excitons generated on the donor polymer reached the donor–acceptor interface and dissociated before radiative decay. Ideal electron acceptor polymers should be able to quench the PL of electron donating polymers, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT. Fig. 3 shows the PL spectra of 1:1 blend films of polymers P1–P4 with P3HT with an excitation wavelength of 503 nm. The fluorescence of P3HT was quenched in 1:1 blends with polymers P1, P2 and P4 indicating electron transfer from the electron rich P3HT to the electron deficient polymers. In contrast, polymer P3 did not effectively quench the fluorescence of P3HT in the 1:1 blend film (Fig. 3). From the frontier orbital energy levels of the polymers, it is apparent that the offsets between the LUMO of P3HT and polymers P1 and P3 are least appropriate for electron transfer from the electron donor to the electron acceptor (Fig. 4).

From the photophysical analysis, it is clear that the electron deficient polymers P1–P4 are potentially suitable active materials for OPV and/or OLED applications. Polymers P1 and P2 showed high fluorescence quantum yields (Table 2) and could be suitable in polymer light emitting diodes. From the frontier orbital measurements and fluorescence quenching experiments, polymers P2 and P4 are suitable electron acceptor materials in OPVs with P3HT as the electron donor.

To explore the electroluminescence (EL) properties of the electron deficient polymers, polymer light emitting devices (PLEDs) were fabricated using the polymers P1, P2 and P3. The typical PLED device structure consists of a transparent, patterned indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode on a glass substrate, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) as a hole injection layer, a 70 nm thick light-emitting polymer layer, a 25 nm thick ZnO nanoparticle layer, and an Al cathode. The ZnO nanoparticles were employed as an electron injector taking advantage of their high electron affinity and high electron mobility.Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PLED with various emitting layers of P1, P2 and P3. Devices with polymers P1 and P2 exhibited good EL properties with turn-on voltages of 1.6 V and 2.4 V, respectively. The device containing P3 experienced a rapid degradation when the voltage was applied with EL only fleetingly observed. The EL spectrum of the polymers P1 and P2 at a driving voltage of 3 V is shown in Fig. 5b (inset shows a photograph of the light emission from PLED devices).
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells (Fig. 6) were fabricated using P3HT as the electron donor material and P2 (or P4) as the electron acceptor material. It should be noted that the solar cell device performance of P2 has been investigated previously and devices were fabricated for comparison in this study. A schematic diagram of the solar cells with conventional device architecture [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ZnO/Al] is shown in Fig. 6a. The current density–voltage characteristics of the devices under simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2) are shown in Fig. 6b and the photovoltaic performances of these devices are summarized in Table 3. The P3HT:P4 device showed the best device performance with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 0.56 V, a fill factor (FF) of 43%, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) value of 1.65 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 0.40%. The device with the P2 polymer exhibits a higher Voc of 0.80 V due to the higher LUMO energy level of the acceptor polymer and PCE of 0.3%. The morphology of both active layers was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Phase separation between the donor P3HT polymer and the acceptor polymer P2 or P4 was evident in the AFM images (ESI, Fig. S7). However, domains of the donor and acceptor materials were inhomogeneous in size despite the use of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive during thin film processing.

A series of electron deficient conjugated polymers containing the benzotriazole building block were synthesised and characterised. As the benzotriazole unit can be considered a moderate electron acceptor, copolymers with stronger electron acceptor units such as benzothiadiazole and benzobisthiadiazole showed reduced frontier orbital energy levels and narrowed HOMO–LUMO energy gap. A high fluorescence quantum yield (φf = 0.9) was recorded for homopolymer P1 while photoluminescence was not observed for copolymer P4. Fluorescence quenching experiments with the electron donor material P3HT indicated that P2 and P4 were suitable electron acceptor components in BHJ solar cells. In device applications, P1 and P2 functioned as the emissive layer in PLED devices. Polymer P2 was also incorporated as the electron acceptor material in BHJ solar cells giving a modest power conversion efficiency of 0.3%. The most electron deficient polymer P4 gave the most promising solar cell device performance of 0.4% in combination with P3HT. Studies are in progress to determine the charge transport properties of these electron deficient polymers.
