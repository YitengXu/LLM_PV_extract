Ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) have demonstrated great potential in promoting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs. Generally, the introduction of a third component with redshifted absorption spectra can broaden the absorption spectra and thereby potentially enhances short-circuit current density (JSC), but reduces open circuit voltage (VOC). Herein, a small-molecule acceptor (SMA) named N7IT with a high LUMO energy level and a redshifted absorption spectrum, is employed as the third component in the PM6:IT-4F-based binary host. Unlike previous results, the introduction of N71T enhances both the VOC and the JSC relative to the PM6:IT-4F host binary system. The champion ternary device (PM6:IT-4F:N7IT = 1:0.7:0.3) demonstrates an outstanding PCE of 15.02%, significantly higher than its binary counterparts. This strategy is further validated in PM6:Y6 blends, where the addition of SY3 featuring near-infrared absorption and high LUMO effectively boosts the PCE from 16.49% to 17.07%. Our result proves the effectiveness of an appropriate third component and demonstrates the potential of red-absorbing, high-LUMO SMAs in further promoting the efficiency of single-junction binary OSCs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have multiple advantages such as light weight, low cost, low temperature printing fabrication and flexibility. The active layer of OSCs is usually made up of an electron donor and an electron acceptor. In recent years, a series of nonfullerene small molecular acceptor (SMA) materials have shown promising potential in achieving high efficiency due to their strong light absorption, tunable electronic energy levels and range of absorption. Generally, a ternary system is an efficient strategy to improve device efficiency. In this work, a SMA named N7IT with a high LUMO energy level and a redshifted absorption spectrum, is employed as the third component in the PM6:IT-4F-based binary host. The champion ternary device demonstrates an outstanding PCE of 15.02%, significantly higher than its binary counterparts. This strategy is further validated in PM6:Y6 blends, where the addition of SY3 featuring near-infrared absorption and high LUMO effectively boosts PCE from 16.49% to 17.07%. Our work shows that it is possible to employ a red-absorbing, high-LUMO SMA to concurrently increase the voltage and current of the nonfullerene OSCs, which could guide the molecular design for ternary blend OSCs.


In the past few years, the field of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) has witnessed significant progress with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) surpassing 17%. The emergence of nonfullerene small-molecule acceptor (SMA) materials plays an important role in promoting device performance due to the synthetic flexibility that offers easily tunable chemical structures, electronic and optical properties to these materials. To date, most of the state-of-the-art single-junction BHJ OSCs comprising one acceptor and one donor in the active layer, which is called a “binary” system, are based on the combination of a conjugate polymer and a nonfullerene SMA. Recent research has demonstrated that adding a third component into the binary system to make a ternary OSC can provide multiple benefits to the device and thus enhance the performance. Apart from the original goal that the third component broadens the absorption spectra, it has been shown by different material systems that the ternary strategy could result in many other favourable properties such as ameliorating exciton dissociation, enhancing charge carrier transport and collection, modifying material crystallinity and improving both the bulk morphology and vertical phase segregation.

From the energetics point of view, some SMAs with higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels than the acceptor in the host binary system were selected as the third component to enhance the VOC of the ternary device. For example, Cui and coworkers introduced IBC-F into the PBDB-T:IE4F-S binary system and the PBDB-T:IE4F-S:IBC-F-based ternary device showed a higher open circuit voltage (VOC) and a higher PCE than the host binary system though the relatively blue absorption of IBC-F did not lead to an enhancement of JSC. Additionally, Hou's group incorporated PC61BM into the efficient PM6:Y6 binary system to improve VOC and JSC simultaneously. To complement the absorption and harvest more red photons, some nonfullerene acceptors with lower bandgaps have been employed as the third component. For instance, our group employed an ultra-low band gap acceptor named IXIC-4Cl (Eg = 1.24 eV) as a third component to broaden the absorption range and improve the morphology of the PM7:ITC-2Cl-based binary system. As a result, the PM7:ITC-2Cl:IXIC-4Cl-based ternary devices realized higher PCEs than the binary counterpart. However, the ternary device showed a lower VOC relative to that of the binary device based on PM7:ITC-2Cl due to the fact that the bandgap of IXIC-4Cl was too narrow to afford a high LUMO level. As a matter of fact, employing a third component with blue-shifted absorption can achieve simultaneous enhancement in both JSC and VOC. Theoretically, if an SMA with a smaller band gap and a higher LUMO energy level than the existing acceptor is used as the third component, it is possible to concurrently increase VOC and JSC and improve the overall device performance. Compared with the former strategy to improve VOC and JSC simultaneously, the latter one can significantly broaden the absorption spectrum and absorb more sunlight, thereby greatly increasing the JSC. Additionally, developing a new strategy will increase our understanding of the working mechanism and facilitate the emergence of new design routes of nonfullerene ternary OSCs. However, such a ternary system has not been reported due to the difficulty in designing a new acceptor with red-shifted absorption and higher LUMO energy level compared with the first acceptor for the ternary system. As an attempt to clearly understand how to successfully design a new acceptor with red-shifted absorption and higher LUMO energy level compared with the first acceptor, we present the following standard as being important: (i) when the central cores of the two acceptors are the same, it is important to choose asymmetric end groups; (ii) when the central cores of the two acceptors are different, choosing an asymmetric core with strong electron-donating ability is beneficial for obtaining high LUMO energy level and red-absorbing acceptors.
In this contribution, an SMA named N7IT is employed as the third component in the PM6:IT-4F-based host binary system. In comparison with the acceptor of IT-4F, N7IT exhibits significantly redshifted absorption (about 50 nm) and a shallower LUMO energy level, and thus the PM6:N7IT-based binary device has a higher VOC and a higher JSC than the PM6:IT-4F-based device. When N7IT is added into the PM6:IT-4F-based binary system, the PCEs of the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT ternary OSCs increased dramatically. The champion ternary device (PM6:IT-4F:N7IT = 1:0.7:0.3) realizes an outstanding PCE of 15.02%, which is significantly higher than those of the binary devices based on PM6:IT-4F (13.62%) and PM6:N7IT (13.91%). The higher PCE of the ternary device is ascribed to the enhanced VOC and JSC relative to the PM6:IT-4F host binary system. It is worth mentioning that the optimal ternary device yields an even larger JSC than that of the PM6:N7IT-based device. Through morphology characterization such as GIWAXS and AFM, device physics studies, and molecular dynamics simulations, the improvement of device performance is mainly attributed to the excellent morphological compatibility between the donor and the two acceptors, the enhanced and balanced charge transport, and the high charge collection and dissociation efficiencies. Additionally, this strategy can also be applied to a PM6:Y6 system, employing an SMA named SY3 with lower bandgap and higher LUMO as the third component relative to Y6 promotes the optimal PCE over 17%. This work offers a new perspective on the third component for constructing highly efficient ternary OSCs.

The synthesis of PM6, IT-4F, and N7IT has previously been reported, and Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the three molecules, as well as the scheme of the device structure used in this work. As exhibited in Fig. 1b, the maximum absorption peaks of PM6, IT-4F, and N7IT are located at 618, 726, and 780 nm, respectively, demonstrating a good absorption complementarity among the materials that makes the blend absorption cover the entire visible region. The absorption spectra of the ternary blend films with different N7IT contents were also measured (Fig. 1c). The PM6:IT-4F:N7IT (1:0.7:0.3, w/w) blend film apparently shows a stronger absorption than the PM6:IT-4F binary film, which is conducive to obtaining a larger JSC in devices. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of the three materials were investigated via an electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. S1 in the ESI). As shown in Fig. 1d, N7IT gives slightly shallower HOMO and LUMO energy levels relative to IT-4F (HOMO/LUMO = −5.54/−4.01 eV for N7IT; HOMO/LUMO = −5.61/−4.06 eV for IT-4F). In addition, the HOMO and LUMO levels of N7IT are between those of PM6 and IT-4F, which could lead to the formation of an energy cascade to facilitate charge transfer.

The photovoltaic performance of the binary or ternary blend were examined by fabricating OSC devices using the conventional device architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/active layer/ZrAcac (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al. The weight ratio of PM6 to the total acceptors was kept constant (1:1) as the composition of the acceptors varied. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimal binary and ternary devices are illustrated in Fig. 2a, with the detailed photovoltaic parameters presented in Table 1. The PM6:IT-4F-based binary device delivers a PCE of 13.62%, with a VOC of 0.869 V, a JSC of 20.26 mA cm−2, and an impressive fill factor (FF) of 0.774. In contrast, the PM6:N7IT-based binary device shows a slightly higher PCE of 13.91%, with a significantly enhanced VOC (0.923 V) and JSC (21.83 mA cm−2), but a reduced FF (0.691), which are comparable to the results we reported recently. The higher VOC and JSC in the PM6:N7IT-based device are mainly related to the shallower LUMO energy level and the redshifted absorption of N7IT. Next, ternary OSCs with different N7IT contents were prepared. Apparently, as the content of N7IT increases, the FFs of the ternary OSCs gradually decrease. Differently, the JSCs of the ternary devices increase first and then decrease along with the increase of N7IT. When the weight percentage of N7IT in the total acceptor is 0.3, the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT-based device achieves the best PCE of 15.02%, with a VOC of 0.890 V, a JSC of 22.54 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.748. It is worth noting that the VOC, JSC, and FF in the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT (1:0.7:0.3)-based devices are not only the highest among all the binary and ternary devices, but also the balance of these three parameters creates the highest PCE. Apparently, as shown in Table S1 (ESI), although employing a third component with blue-shifted absorption can achieve simultaneous enhancement in both JSC and VOC, the JSC increase is very limited. In contrast, our strategy of employing a third component with red-shifted absorption and higher LUMO value can not only increase the VOC, but also significantly broaden the absorption spectrum and thereby greatly increase the JSC. The certified PCE by the National Institute of Metrology in China is 14.08% (Fig. S2 in the ESI), which confirms the reliability of the champion efficiency of the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT-based ternary device. Apart from the device efficiency, the shelf-life and photostability of the binary devices and the optimal ternary device were investigated (Fig. S3, ESI). The packaged PM6:IT-4F:N7IT-based ternary device in air can maintain 68% of its PCE after 30 days, which is slightly lower than that of the PM6:N7IT-based binary device (72%) but higher than that of the PM6:IT-4F-based ternary device (60%). The three packaged devices under continuous LED illumination show a similar trend to that tested in the air. These results indicate that adding the N7IT into the PM6:IT-4F host system can improve the device stability.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices is measured and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. It can be easily observed that the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT-based ternary device shows higher IPCE values in the range of 550–760 nm relative to those of the reference binary devices. In addition, the integrated JSCs from the IPCE spectra are consistent with those obtained from the J–V curves with deviations of less than 3%.
To gain insight into the exciton dissociation and charge collection in different blends, we investigated the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 2c), and the corresponding data are shown in Table S2 (ESI), including the saturated current (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss), and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll). Under the short circuit conditions, the ηdiss values are calculated to be 96.2%, 95.0% and 92.9% for the PM6:IT-4F, PM6:IT-4F:N7IT, and PM6:IT-4F:N7IT-based device, respectively. The ηcoll follows the same trend as ηdiss, indicating that the charge collection and exciton dissociation efficiency are slightly reduced after adding NTI7. These results can account for the gradually decreased FF as the content of N7IT increases. Furthermore, the bimolecular recombination in the two binary and the optimal ternary device were investigated by measuring the J–V curves under different illumination intensities (P). The relationship between JSC and P can be described by a power-law formula of JSC ∝ PSlight, where the exponent S can reflect the bimolecular recombination degree. As exhibited in Fig. 2d, the exponent S values of PM6:IT-4F, PM6:IT-4F:N7IT and PM6:N7IT-based devices are 0.978, 0.965 and 0.943, respectively, which follows the trend of the FF in the solar cell devices. We further studied the trap-assisted recombination mechanisms by plotting VOC as a function of Plight. The relationship between Plight and VOC can be described as VOC ∝ lnPlight (Fig. S4, ESI). The slope is calculated to be 1.27 kT/q for the PM6:IT-4F blend, 1.54 kT/q for the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT blend, and 1.81 kT/q for the PM6:N7IT blend, respectively, indicating that the monomolecular recombination mechanism was gradually dominated with the increase of N7IT in the ternary blend.
To investigate the effect of incorporation of N7IT on the charge transport properties of the devices, the hole (μh) and electron morbidities (μe) were evaluated by a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. As displayed in Fig. S5 and Table S3 (ESI), in the PM6:IT-4F blend film, the hole and electron mobilities are 6.71 × 10−4 and 4.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio (1.51). The PM6:N7IT blend shows higher hole and electron mobilities (8.56 × 10−4 and 4.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), but a less balanced μh/μe ratio (1.84), resulting from the strong crystallinity of N7IT (as discussed below). As expected, the PM6:IT-4F-N7IT-based ternary blend displays an intermediate hole mobility (8.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μh/μe ratio (1.66), while the electron mobility of 4.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in this ternary blend is the highest, which could be attributed to the interaction between IT-4F and N7IT. The gradually increasing μh/μe ratio is consistent with the trend of FF.
To understand the interplay between IT-4F and N7IT, we first investigate the charge (or energy) transfer between the two acceptors via measuring the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of IT-4F, N7IT neat films and the IT-4F:N7IT (0.7:0.3) blend film (Fig. 2e). IT-4F and N7IT neat films show strong PL emission in the range of 800–1000 nm, and the maximum emission peaks of IT-4F and N7IT are at about 798 nm and 842 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2e, in the IT-4F:N7IT (0.7:0.3) blend film, the incorporation of N7IT into IT-4F makes the PL intensity of IT-4F decrease, and at the same time, compared with the PL intensity of pure N7IT film, the PL intensity of the IT-4F:N7IT blend in the low energy region increases. This result clearly indicates that energy transfer from IT-4F to N7IT occurs. In addition, a series of organic solar cells were constructed with neat IT-4F or N7IT or IT-4F:N7IT (0.7:0.3) blend as the active layers to further survey the interaction between IT-4F and N7IT. As exhibited in Fig. 2f, the JSC values of the devices based on IT-4F and N7IT neat films are 0.22 and 0.33 mA cm−2, respectively. Surprisingly, the solar cell employing IT-4F:N7IT (0.7:0.3) as the active layer shows a JSC of 0.87 mA cm−2, much higher than the single-component devices, Which also indicates that charge-transfer exists between IT-4F and N7IT.
To correlate device performance with the morphology of the active layers, we first performed grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments on the single component and blend films (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6, ESI). As shown in Fig. 3, both neat IT-4F and N7IT films show a preferential face-on orientation, favourable for charge transport in the vertical direction. Besides, in comparison with IT-4F, the π–π stacking of N7IT exhibits a much greater crystal coherence length (CCL, 2.01 nm) than that of IT-4F (1.07 nm), indicating the stronger crystallization propensity of N7IT. The larger peak area and higher scattering intensity in the in-plane direction for the (100) peak also demonstrates the stronger crystallinity of N7IT. Similarly, the PM6:IT-4F and PM6:N7IT-based binary blends show the same trend as that in the neat films. The CCLs of the PM6:N7IT blend for the (100) scattering (lamellar stacking) in the in-plane (IP) direction at qr of ∼0.30 Å−1 is 12.1 nm, and that in the out-of-plane (OOP) for the π–π (010) stacking peak at qz of ∼1.72 Å−1 is 3.3 nm, which are higher than the corresponding values of the PM6:IT-4F blend (7.1 nm for the (100) scattering at qr of ∼0.29 Å−1 and 2.1 nm for the π–π (010) stacking peak at qz of ∼1.73 Å−1). Upon adding N7IT into the PM6:IT-4F binary blend, the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT ternary blend exhibits intermediate morphology characteristics, the CCLs of the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT blend in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) direction are 8.5 and 2.5 nm, respectively, and the parameters are more biased towards the PM6:IT-4F blend, which can be confirmed by different scattering intensity in the IP and OOP direction. The gradually reduced CCLs are consistent with the data of mobility (as discussed above).
In addition to GIWAXS, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the surface morphology of the optimal ternary and two binary blend films (Fig. 4). In AFM height images, the PM6:IT-4F and PM6:N7IT blends display root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.33 and 2.55 nm, respectively. The larger RMS value of PM6:N7IT is ascribed to the strong crystallinity of N7IT. In comparison with the two binary blend films, the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT ternary blend shows a moderate RMS value of 1.66 nm. These results agree with the GIWAXS data. In AFM phase images, all the blends show clear nanofibre network structures, particularly for the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT ternary and the PM6:N7IT binary blend. In addition, the size of the nanofibril structures becomes larger with increasing N7IT contents.
The molecular interaction between IT-4F and N7IT was also investigated by the molecular dynamic (MD) method, and three configurations with interaction from the dynamic trajectory were randomly extracted (Fig. 5 and Fig. S7, ESI). The binding energies (ΔG), including the molecular mechanics (MM) and the density functional theory (DFT) interaction energies of IT-4F, N7IT and IT-4F:N7IT, were calculated with the basis set superposition error corrected, and the corresponding data are shown in Table S4 (ESI). IT-4F:N7IT shows stronger binding energies, i.e., ΔG (MM) of −28.65 kcal mol−1 and ΔG (DFT) of −25.14 kcal mol−1, than N7IT:N7IT, indicating a stronger tendency of binding between IT-4F and N7IT, which could be used to explain the morphology results from the AFM and GIWAXS experiments. Moreover, ΔG (MM) are consistent with the ΔG (DFT), proving the reliability of the configuration.
The domain sizes of the binary and ternary blends are further investigated by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments (Fig. 5b and Fig. S8, ESI). The pure phase domain sizes (2Rg) for the PM6:IT-4F, PM6:N7IT and optimal ternary blends are calculated to be 30.6, 54.8 and 43.3 nm, respectively. The lowest pure phase domain size in the PM6:IT-4F-based binary blend contributes to the charge transport and exciton dissociation, agreeing with the highest FF in the PM6:IT-4F-based device. Additionally, the corresponding intermixing domain sizes for the PM6:IT-4F, PM6:N7IT and optimal ternary blends are estimated to be 14.5, 28.0 and 24.0 nm, respectively. These results are also in agreement with the GIWAXS and AFM results.
Apart from applying this strategy to the traditional “acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)”-type SMA of IT-4F system, we have also employed this strategy to the Y6 system, a special A–D–A-type SMA (or an A–DAD–A-type SMA). A SMA named SY3 (Fig. 6a) was synthesized according to the literature. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI), the absorption onsets for Y6 and SY3 are located at 930 nm and 935 nm, respectively. SY3 exhibits slightly higher HOMO and LUMO energy levels relative to Y6 (HOMO and LUMO are −5.73 and −4.00 eV for Y6, HOMO and LUMO are −5.69 and −3.97 eV for SY3). Consequently, SY3 is employed as the third component in the PM6:Y6-based binary host. As shown in Fig. 6b and Table S5 (ESI), the champion ternary device (PM6:Y6:SY3 = 1:1:0.2) realized an outstanding PCE of 17.07%, which is higher than those of the binary devices based PM6:Y6 (16.49%) and PM6:SY3 (16.63%). The higher PCE for the PM6:Y6:SY3 ternary device is ascribed to the enhanced VOC and JSC relative to the PM6:Y6 host binary system. The integrated JSC value of the optimal ternary device is 25.09 mA cm−2, respectively, matching well with the JSC values (25.51 mA cm−2) obtained from the J–V curve (within 2.0% mismatch) (Fig. 6c). The device stability of PM6:Y6- and PM6:SY3-based binary devices and the PM6:Y6:SY3-based ternary device were investigated (Fig. S10, ESI). Similar to the results discussed above, introducing a red-absorbing SMA with high LUMO level can enhance the device stability of the binary host system.

In conclusion, high-efficiency ternary OSCs have been demonstrated with two nonfullerene SMAs (N7IT and IT-4F). Compared to the IT-4F, N7IT has a significantly redshifted absorption and a shallower LUMO energy level. The addition of N7IT into the PM6:IT-4F-based host binary system significantly enhances the PCE where the champion ternary device (PM6:IT-4F:N7IT = 1:0.7:0.3) realized an outstanding PCE of 15.02%, which is significantly higher than those of the binary devices based on PM6:IT-4F (13.62%) and PM6:N7IT (13.91%). Notably, the higher PCE for the PM6:IT-4F:N7IT ternary device is ascribed to the concurrent enhancement in VOC and JSC, which has been considered extremely challenging for highly efficient nonfullerene OSCs. It is also worth mentioning that the optimal ternary device yields a JSC larger than that of either binary device, which may result from the excellent morphology compatibility between the acceptors that is confirmed by GIWAXS, GISAXS and MD simulations, which reveals a strong tendency of binding between IT-4F and N7IT. Importantly, this strategy can also be applied to a PM:Y6 system, employing an SMA named SY3 with lower bandgap and higher LUMO values as the third component relative to Y6 promotes the optimal PCE over 17%. This work shows that it is possible to employ a red-absorbing, high-LUMO SMA to concurrently increase the voltage and current of the nonfullerene OSCs, which could guide the molecular design for ternary blend BHJ solar cells.
