The acceptor in organic solar cells (OSCs) is of paramount importance for achieving a high photovoltaic performance. Based on the well-known non-fullerene acceptor Y6, we designed a set of asymmetric A–D1A′D2–A type new acceptors Y6–C, Y6–N, Y6–O, Y6–Se, and Y6–Si by substituting the two S atoms of one thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit with C, N, O, Se, and Si atoms, respectively. The electronic, optical, and crystal properties of Y6 and the designed acceptors, as well as the interfacial charge-transfer (CT) mechanisms between the donor PM6 and the investigated acceptors have been systematically studied. It is found that the newly designed asymmetric acceptors possess suitable energy levels and strong interactions with the donor PM6. Importantly, the newly designed acceptors exhibit enhanced light harvesting ability and more CT states with larger oscillator strengths in the 40 lowest excited states. Among the multiple CT mechanisms, the direct excitation of CT states is found to be more favored in the case of PM6/newly designed acceptors than that of PM6/Y6. This work not only offers a set of promising acceptors superior to Y6, but also demonstrates that designing acceptors with asymmetric structure could be an effective strategy to improve the performance of OSCs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their low-cost, light weight, simple manufacturing process, and flexible preparation. The photoactive layer blending donors and acceptors, which absorbs sunlight, generates excitons, separates excitons, and transports charges, is the key component of special relevance to OSCs. In the past few years, acceptors are at the forefront of research and development in the domain of the photoactive layer. Besides fullerene-based acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have received a boost alongside the progress in materials engineering. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NFAs-based OSCs has been improved to over 18%. Compared to fullerene acceptors, NFAs can adjust energy levels more effectively through chemical modification, thus forming effective complementary absorption with the donor and performing better charge separation at the interface.

On the experimental side, various NFA acceptors have been developed to increase the PCE. Zhan and Hou et al. synthesized a large number of NFAs based on an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core or a dithiophene[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core. Among them, the star acceptor ITIC with the IDTT core had a PCE of 6.8%, which was the highest PCE with NFAs at that time. In 2019, a single-junction OSC using the ITIC-modified acceptor Y6, which featured a fused-ring with an electron-deficient core in the structure, achieved a PCE of 15.7%. After that, several series of symmetric Y6-based NFAs of the A–DA′D–A type have been synthesized and characterized. In recent years, significant breakthroughs have also been made on asymmetric NFAs. Bo et al. reported a non-fused ring acceptor o-4TBC-2F with near-IR absorption, and the o-4TBC-2F-based device displayed higher charge mobility, low energy loss, and a high PCE of 10.26%. Sun and co-workers synthesized a symmetric acceptor TPT-2F and asymmetric NFAs TPTT-2F, TPTTT-2F, and SePTTT-2F, where the obtained PCE followed the order of TPT-2F (8.33%) < TPTT-2F (9.98%) < TPTTT-2F (12.03%) < SePTTT-2F (12.24%). In 2020, Yan's team synthesized the asymmetric acceptor BTP-2F-ThCl by replacing one IC-2F of Y6 with CPTCN-2Cl, and the BTP-2F-ThCl-based device afforded a boosted PCE of as high as 17.06% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.869 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 25.38 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 77.4%.
On the theoretical side, a number of computational studies have disclosed plentiful information about the optoelectronic properties of NFAs and the CT processes at the D/A interfaces of OSCs. In both donor/C60 and donor/NFAs systems, it has been found that the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) difference between the donor and the acceptor at the D/A interface could result in an intermolecular electric field (IEF), which provides the driving force for the splitting of CT states into free charges. Su and co-workers found that the higher Frenkel exciton (FE) states in biazulene diimides-based NFAs could promote charge separation at the D/A interface by the hot exciton mechanism, and multiple CT channels (IEF, hot exciton, and direct excitation of CT states) may co-exist in the same D/A interface. Yi et al. underlined the importance of multi-channel exciton dissociation in D18/Y6 complexes, barrierless charge separation electronic due to electronic polarization in OSCs based on typical A–D–A acceptors (ITIC, IT-4F, and Y6), and revealed that end-group π–π stacking is an effective way to achieve both small energy loss and efficient light absorption for high-efficiency organic photovoltaics. Our group studied the effects of modifying π-bridge units and end-capped groups on the optoelectronic properties of A–π–D–π–A type NFAs. Moreover, our recent work on ITIC-based heterojunctions illustrated that there exist more opportunities for producing CT states via the IEF mechanism in PBDB-TF/A5_h than those in PBDB-TF/ITIC. It is worth noting that most of the above mentioned studies are about the acceptors with symmetric structures.
In this work, considering the push–pull electron effects of asymmetric structures, we designed and characterized a series of A–D1A′D2–A type NFAs (Y6–C, Y6–N, Y6–O, Y6–Se, and Y6–Si) by substituting one thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit of Y6 with 1,4-dihydropentalene, 1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole, furo[3,2-b]furan, selenopheno[3,2-b]selenophene, and 1,4-dihydrosilolo[3,2-b]silole, respectively (see Fig. 1). Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations have been carried out to explore the optical and electronic properties of Y6 and the newly designed Y6-based asymmetric NFAs. The interfacial properties and CT mechanisms at the D/A interfaces composed by the donor PM6 and the studied Y6-based acceptors have been discussed in detail.

The geometries of the investigated molecules were relaxed to their potential energy minima without imaginary frequency using the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. The TD-DFT method at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level was used to evaluate the properties related to excited states. The empirical D3 dispersion corrections were included using the Becke–Johnson damping potential in DFT and TDDFT calculations. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) was employed to consider the solvation effect in chloroform. The above calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 code. The analysis of both optical properties and ESP was done using the Multiwfn software.

To predict the crystal structures of the studied acceptors, the starting geometries were constructed from the experimental crystal structure of Y6. The crystal structures were firstly optimized using the Materials Studio software package employing the Forcite module using the Dreiding force field with the setting in fine. Then, further structure optimizations were performed by the periodic DFT calculations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with a plane-wave energy cutoff of 450 eV, where the exchange and correlation effects were described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) of the acceptor is of the utmost importance for achieving a high PCE by determining the Voc of the device. ΔED–A/LUMO defined as the difference of ELUMO between the donor and the acceptor, is one of the driving forces for exciton dissociation and subsequently affords high PCE. The ELUMO and ΔED–A/LUMO values of the donor PM6 and the studied acceptors are shown in Fig. 2. Y6–Si has quite a low-lying LUMO energy level (−4.09 eV), which is ascribed to the σ*–π* conjugation in the ring of silole, that is, the orbital interaction between the σ* orbital of the two exocyclic σ bonds on the silicon atom and the π* orbital of the conjugation. The larger inductive electron-withdrawing effect from oxygen compared to sulfur and selenium results in a slightly lower-lying LUMO (−4.05 eV) for Y6–O compared to its sulfur counterpart Y6 (−4.04 eV) and selenium-based counterpart Y6–Se (−4.04 eV). The largest upshifted LUMO energy level (−3.94 eV) of Y6–N is due to lone pair electrons of nitrogen increasing the electron donating strength as a result of low n–π* transitions. The LUMO energy levels of Y6 and Y6–Se are equivalent (−4.04 eV) due to the balance of the strong spin–orbital coupling of Se and the better planarity of the conjugated backbone of the bithiophene linker in Y6. In all, the ELUMO values of the newly designed acceptors are lower than that of the donor PM6. This satisfies the matching principle and is conducive to the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor during the charge transfer process. The ΔED–A/LUMO data range from 0.44 eV to 0.59 eV, ensuring effective exciton dissociation. Among them, the smallest ΔED–A/LUMO of 0.44 eV between Y6–N and PM6 is expected to suppress the voltage loss (Eloss).

The exciton (electron–hole pair) binding energy (Eb) is one of the sources of Eloss, which determines exciton dissociation and Jsc.Eb is represented by the following formula:
Eb = Ege − Ego = Egf − Ego = VIP − VEA − E1
where the electronic bandgap (
Ege) can be approximated to the basic bandgap (Egf) of the difference between the vertical ionization energy (VIP) and the vertical electron affinity energy (VEA), and the optical bandgap (Ego) is treated as the energy of the first excited state (E1). Generally, the smaller the Eb, the smaller the driving force for exciton dissociation into free charge, leading to a reduction of Eloss, and thus an increase of Voc, and finally an improvement of the device performance. The Eb of the studied molecules is 0.37 eV for Y6, 0.32 eV for Y6–C, 0.35 eV for Y6–N, 0.36 eV for Y6–O, 0.36 eV for Y6–Se, and 0.34 eV for Y6–Si. It shows that the Eb of the newly designed asymmetric A–D1A′D2–A type acceptors is 0.01–0.05 eV smaller than that of the symmetric A–DA′D–A type acceptor Y6. In addition, all the obtained Eb values are smaller than the computed ΔED–A/LUMO data in Fig. 2, implying enough driving force for electron–hole separation.

The distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the LUMO, are important aspects of electronic properties. As shown in Fig. 3, the newly designed molecules have a wider delocalization range in the LUMO than that in the HOMO like Y6, indicating that they are suitable acceptors for receiving electrons from the donor or delivering holes to the donor. Both the HOMO and the LUMO of Y6 are symmetric because of its symmetric backbone. For the newly designed acceptors, the FMOs of Y6–N, Y6–O, and Y6–Si are obviously asymmetric, while the HOMO and the LUMO of Y6–C and Y6–Se are very similar to those of Y6 with symmetric distribution. This could be explained by the similar electronegativity of C (2.5), S (2.5), and Se (2.4), which is clearly different from that of Si (1.8), N (3.0), and O (3.5). The asymmetric distribution of FMOs in Y6–N, Y6–O, and Y6–Si is expected to enhance the carrier mobility by an electronic push–pull effect.

The optical characteristics of acceptors are widely concerned with because the absorption of sunshine is the first step of photoelectric conversion in OSCs. As shown in Fig. 4, the computed maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of Y6 is 728 nm, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (731 nm). It is clear that the absorption spectra of the newly designed acceptors are red-shifted relative to that of Y6, which is partly attributed to the evident intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) due to the push–pull effects in asymmetric structures. For Y6–Si, the lower electronegativity and larger atomic radius of Si, and the particular σ*–π* conjugation interactions between the Si atom and the π-electron system lead to a higher quinoid resonance character, which in turn reduces the aromaticity and results in a large bathochromic shift. The C in Y6–C has the smallest atomic radius, which keeps the planarity and conjugation of the molecule, which is conducive to bathochromic shift.

To further demonstrate the effect of the asymmetric structure on excited states, we calculated the charge difference density (CDD) and the amount of ICT at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-311(d,p) level. In Fig. S2 (ESI), we can see the CDD maps of Y6 are symmetrical and have even distribution, whereas those of the five newly designed acceptors manifest the characteristics of uneven distribution, especially in the high-lying excited states. We split the molecule skeleton into two parts as depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI) to quantitatively explore the characteristics of the charge distributions. The transferred charge amounts from fragment 1 to fragment 2 are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI) for the five and twenty lowest excited states. It can be seen that there is no charge transfer from fragment 1 to fragment 2 in Y6 among the five lowest excited states. For the newly designed acceptors, there are noticeable transferred charges between fragment 1 and fragment 2, verifying that asymmetric A–D1A′D2–A molecules can enhance the ICT.

The electrostatic potential (ESP) is another important factor affecting ICT. The maximum ESP, minimum ESP, and the difference between maximum ESP and minimum ESP of the studied molecules are given in Table 2. It can be seen that both the maximum ESP and the minimum ESP of Y6 and Y6–Se are almost the same, resulting in a similar difference (about 79 kcal mol−1). The difference between the maximum ESP and the minimum ESP of Y6–C, Y6–O, and Y6–Si is 86.3, 82.3, and 80.1 kcal mol−1, respectively. Pyrrole is a strong electron donor owing to the lone pair electrons of nitrogen increasing the electron donating strength, resulting in a strong push–pull effect. As a result of more positive maximum ESP and more negative minimum ESP of Y6–N allow the difference of up to 101 kcal mol−1, indicating a stronger intramolecular electron push–pull effect in Y6–N.

It is known that the stacking structures of the acceptors are closely related to the film morphology assignment and charge transport properties. We can see all the studied acceptors pack in a grid-like fashion (Fig. S4, ESI) and crystallize in a monoclinic unit cell (Fig. 5), which are in good accordance with the single crystal structure of Y6 reported by recent experiments. As depicted in Fig. 5, all the studied acceptors form tight co-facial π–π interactions, where the average distances between adjacent molecular planes are 3.79 Å for Y6, 3.56 Å for Y6–C, 3.55 Å for Y6–N, 3.60 Å for Y6–O, 3.62 Å for Y6–Se, and 3.60 Å for Y6–Si. The evident reduction of the intermolecular distances from Y6 to the newly designed acceptors suggests stronger intermolecular interactions after structure modification and thus may facilitate the electron transport among the acceptors.


The donor/acceptor (D/A) interface controls the exciton dissociation, which is a key step in OSCs. We constructed the D/A interfaces of PM6/Y6, PM6/Y6–C, PM6/Y6–N, PM6/Y6–O, PM6/Y6–Se, and PM6/Y6–Si by combining the donor PM6 and the studied Y6-based acceptors. The optimized structures of the D/A interfaces are shown in Fig. 6, in which the overlapping parts of the donor and the acceptor are fitted as a plane on the donor and the acceptor respectively. The average distances between PM6 and the newly designed acceptors (3.26 Å, 3.28 Å, 3.32 Å, 3.30 Å, and 3.32 Å in PM6/Y6–C, Y6–N, Y6–O, Y6–Se, and Y6–Si) are about 3.30 Å, which is similar to that of 3.26 Å in PM6/Y6. The D–A interaction energy Einteraction was calculated according to the formula Einteraction = ED/A − ED − EA + EBSSE, where ED/A, ED, EA, and EBSSE denote the energy of the combined D/A system, the donor, the acceptor, and the basis set superposition error, respectively. The computed Einteraction values vary from −1.29 eV to −1.50 eV, indicating strong D–A interactions between the donor PM6 and the studied Y6-based acceptors. Similar large D/A interactional energy were found in previous reports, which is favourable for charge transport in OSCs.

The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) is a crucial factor, which dominates Jsc and thus affects the PCE of solar cells.Fig. 7 shows the computed LHE of the investigated D–A interfaces by employing the equation of LHE = 1 − 10−f (f is the oscillator strength). We can see that the LHE values of the interfaces with the newly designed acceptors are larger than that of PM6/Y6, especially in the over 800 nm region, demonstrating enhanced light harvesting ability for the newly designed A–D1A′D2–A type acceptors.
To get more information about the CT mechanisms at the D/A interfaces, the energy levels and oscillator strengths of the 40 lowest excited states of the studied PM6/Y6-based acceptor interfaces were computed at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level and are shown in Fig. 8 and 9. The charge transfer (CT) state between the donor and the acceptor at the D/A interface is a paramount intermediate state to realize charge separation.Fig. 8 shows the percentage of the CT states in the 40 lowest excited states. We can see the percentage of CT states in PM6/Y6 is 55%, which means that there are more CT states than the localized FE states and justifies why Y6 is an efficient acceptor. Regarding the newly designed acceptors, the CT state percentages in PM6/Y6–C (52.5%), PM6/Y6–Se (55%), and PM6/Y6–Si (57.5%) are almost equivalent to that of the PM6/Y6 system. Importantly, the percentages of CT states in PM6/Y6–N and PM6/Y6–O are 67.5% and 62.5%, which are 23% and 14% higher than that of the PM6/Y6 system. Many more CT states in PM6/Y6–N and PM6/Y6–O are expected to facilitate charge separation at the D/A interfaces.
As shown in Fig. 9, the S1 state is a FE state localized on the acceptor and the S2 state (either the CT state or the FE state) is at least 0.3 eV above the S1 state in all the studied systems, suggesting that promoting charge separation at the D/A interfaces by IEF or hot exciton mechanisms from S1 state can be ruled out. We also considered the FE1 dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface proceeds via a hole transfer mechanism from acceptor to donor, which is determined by the energy difference in HOMO energies of the donor and the acceptor (ΔEHOMO = EHOMO,D − EHOMO,A). As shown in Table S2 (ESI), the ΔEHOMO values are negative, indicating unfavored hole transfer for the S1 state. The ESP surfaces in Fig. S5 (ESI) illustrate that the average ESP is about 17 kcal mol−1 in Y6 and the newly designed acceptors, so the probability of the IEF mechanism depends on the energy difference between the FE state and the above CT state. For the interfaces of PM6/Y6–C, PM6/Y6–N, and PM6/Y6–Se, the CT2 or CT1 state lies 0.06 eV, 0.11 eV, and 0.09 eV above the lower FE2 state, suggesting large charge separation probability via the IEF mechanism. As for the hot exciton mechanism, in which the charge is transferred from the high-energy FE state to the low-energy CT state followed by further separation into free charges, it must be possible for the studied PM6/Y6-based acceptor systems since the FE states and CT states are staggered and densely distributed especially in the high-energy (above 3 eV) region. It is worth noting that there is only one CT state (CT1) in the low-energy (below 3 eV) region of Fig. 9 for the PM6/Y6 system, while there are two CT states (CT1 and CT2) for PM6/Y6–N and PM6/Y6–Si and three CT states (CT1, CT2, and CT3) for PM6/Y6–C, PM6/Y6–O, and PM6/Y6–Se.
Moreover, the oscillator strengths of the CT states for the interfaces with the newly designed acceptors, such as 0.80 (CT2 for PM6/Y6–C), 0.48 (CT1 for PM6/Y6–N), 0.60 (CT2 for PM6/Y6–N), 0.44 (CT2 for PM6/Y6–O), 0.94 (CT3 for PM6/Y6–O), 0.95 (CT2 for PM6/Y6–Se), 0.74 (CT1 for PM6/Y6–Si), and 0.64 (CT2 for PM6/Y6–Si), are markedly larger than that of 0.03 of CT1 in PM6/Y6. The increased oscillator strengths of the CT states indicate that these CT states are hybrid FE-CT states that could borrow some oscillator strengths from the FE state. Thus, direct excitation to the CT states is easier to take place in the low-energy excitation region for the systems with the newly designed acceptors than that with Y6. In short, multiple CT mechanisms, including IEF, hot exciton, and direct excitation mechanisms are found to be feasible for the studied PM6/Y6-based acceptor interfaces. The direct excitation of CT states is found to be more favored in the case of newly designed acceptors than that of Y6. It is worth noting that the presence of CT states with large oscillator strength may result in fast charge recombination. However, a complete picture of charge separation has to involve both the effects of D/A morphology and the influence of charge separated state and thus is beyond the scope of this work.

In this work, we designed five A–D1A′D2–A type Y6-based acceptors (Y6–C, Y6–N, Y6–O, Y6–Se, and Y6–Si) with an asymmetric structure and theoretically investigated the electronic properties, optical properties, crystal structures, and interfacial properties with the donor PM6. Thanks to the properties of heteroatoms such as lone pair electrons of N, vacant d-orbitals of Se and Si, aromatic–quinoidal transformation of Si, and strong electronegativity of O, the newly designed acceptors possess appropriate energy levels, enhanced light absorption ability, and improved interfacial properties with more CT states. Multiple charge transfer mechanisms including IEF, hot exciton, and direct excitation mechanisms are feasible for the studied PM6/Y6-based acceptor interfaces, where the direct excitation of the CT state is predominant for the systems with the newly designed acceptors. Our calculations not only put forward a set of promising non-fullerene acceptors, but also provide the theoretical basis for the synthesis of asymmetric acceptors for high efficiency OSCs. The rapid development of asymmetric organic synthetic chemistry makes the synthesis of Y6 derivatives theoretically designed in this work very promising.
