To tailor the Au@Ag@SiO2 LSPR effect by varying the Ag shell thickness, the Au@Ag@SiO2 core–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles are fabricated and introduced into DSSC for improving light harvesting and decreasing the recombination of photo-carriers. The Au@Ag@SiO2 electrode exhibits a photo-conversion efficiency of 23.42% (486.7 nm, 10 mW cm−2).

The considerable scientific importance of gold and silver nanoparticles is attributable to a great extent to their fascinating optical properties known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The size and shape dependent optical properties of gold and silver nanoparticles (NPs) render them suitable candidates for applications in diverse fields. Gold and silver are attractive for optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and sensing, because of a high plasmonic efficiency and superior electromagnetic enhancement in the visible range. Compared to Au nanomaterials, Ag nanomaterials exhibit higher solar energy conversion efficiencies and refractive index sensitivities. Besides, spherical silver and gold nanoparticles display in optical absorption spectroscopy a size dependent plasmon resonance wavelength between 395–430 nm and 505–560 nm, respectively. While, Au@Ag core–shell nanomaterials own a board absorption region between 400 nm and 550 nm with the changed thickness of the Ag shell. Therefore, many researchers have explored the possibility of combining Au and Ag into one single system to obtain a stronger LSPR for broadening their applications (including catalysis, sensing, imaging, and biomedicine). Significantly, Au@Ag for those applications is closely dependent on their LSPR effect, which needs to be finely tailored and tuned by varying the Ag shell thickness.

As known, Au@Ag core–shell nanomaterials with various morphologies have been synthesized using an epitaxial growth process that involves the conformal deposition of Ag on the surface of Au seeds. In most studies to date, the Ag shell is not evenly deposited on the entire surface of the Au core because of the highly anisotropic shapes of Au seeds used in the syntheses. It is important to synthesize the uniform Au@Ag core–shell nanostructure. In addition, due to the high surface recombination velocity of the bare metallic NPs, Au@Ag core–shell nanoparticles need an ultra-thin insulator (SiO2) on the surface to prevent from the recombination of photo-carriers and corrosion in the electrolyte. Here, we report a facile route to synthesize Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. The uniform quasi-spherical Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles possess diameters ranging from 70 nm to 110 nm by varying the Ag shell thickness. Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles own the changed LSPR properties. Therefore, the enhanced light-harvesting and the triggered LSPR effect of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles by exactly adjusting the Ag shell thickness are utilized to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency in DSSCs.
The schematic representation of the LSPR effect of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles on the changed thickness of the Ag shell is shown in Fig. 1. A series of uniform Ag shells are formed on the Au nanoparticles by L-ascorbic acid reducing AgNO3 under alkaline conditions. The growth of the silver shell onto Au NPs led to color changes from different tones of red to orange (Fig. 1). The experimental details of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles are provided in the ESI.
The synthesized Au@Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles with the controllable Ag shell thickness were based on the addition of the Ag resource. As reported, due to the presence of Au seeds at low pH, L-ascorbic acid could not reduce AgNO3. It was critical to adjust the pH to 8.5 with 0.1 M NaOH after each dropwise AgNO3 addition. The formation of free Ag nuclei was inhibited through a mild reducing agent and the gradual AgNO3 addition under low speed stirring. The Au@Ag core–shell nanoparticle size could be adjusted by tuning the thickness of Ag shells (a series of the gradual AgNO3 addition). Au@Ag core–shell nanoparticles were coated by the SiO2 ultra-thin shell, which was formed by (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APS) and sodium silicate solution under 100 °C (see the Experimental section). Therefore, the SiO2 ultra-thin shell as the protective layer could expand its applications.
The controllable Ag shell thicknesses of quasi-spherical Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2a–f. The size of citrate-stabilized Au nanoparticles was ∼50 nm and subsequently used as seeds for silver growth (the thickness of the Ag shell: 5–25 nm). Varying volume of AgNO3 was added for controlling the thickness of the Ag shell. Upon increasing the volume of AgNO3 from 180 μl to 900 μl, the thickness of the deposited silver shell also increased, from 5.5 ± 2.5 nm, 10.2 ± 3.1 nm, and 14.7 ± 3.8 nm to 25.1 ± 2.7 nm, respectively.
As previously reported, an electron density image of the Au core was darker than that of the Ag shell because the different electron densities of Au and Ag atoms provided sufficient contrast to distinguish the Au core and the Ag shell. But, it was also hard to observe the SiO2 shell under low magnification because of the ultra-thin shell and low contrast compared with Au and Ag. To further characterize the Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles, SiO2 ultra-thin shell nanoparticles were observed under high magnification as shown in Fig. 2g–h. As shown in Fig. 2h, the diameter of the Au core, the thickness of the silver shell and the thickness of the SiO2 outer shell were ∼50 nm (yellow area), ∼15 nm (purple area) and ∼5 nm (blue area), respectively. It was directly proved that the Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell structure was fabricated successfully.
The silver shell formation effect of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles on the light absorption spectra was also monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3a. Au@SiO2 and Ag@SiO2 NPs absorption peaks were 540 nm and 420 nm, which were attributed to their LSPR effect. The absorption intensity was improved with the increased Ag shell thickness, along with a significant blue shift. This feature (blue shift) was explained by the increased particle volume and the dielectric properties of silver.31 In addition, by increasing the thickness of the Ag shell, the absorption intensity of the broad shoulder peak at around 400–500 nm (indicative of Ag shells) was improved. This broadening phenomenon was attributed to the LSPR effect of Au@Ag, which controlled the absorption peak by adjusting the thickness of the Ag shell. Using the unique plasmonic cooperation effect of Au@Ag@SiO2, they could improve the light absorption. In particular, the maximum absorption peak of Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 was at ∼490 nm, which located the strongest irradiance in the visible light region. Therefore, Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 could efficiently enhance the light absorption utilized LSPR effect. However, a significant shift of the max absorption position occurred when the series of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles were anchored to the electrodes. The absorption spectra for electrodes (electrodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7: pure TiO2; TiO2/Au@SiO2; TiO2/Ag@SiO2; TiO2/Au@Ag(5 nm)@SiO2; TiO2/Au@Ag(10 nm)@SiO2; TiO2/Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 and TiO2/Au@Ag(25 nm)@SiO2) are depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI). In Fig. S2 (ESI), there was not obvious absorption in the visible light region for electrode 1. At λ = 525–575 nm, the TiO2/Au@SiO2 electrode showed stronger absorption than that of electrode 1. It was worth noting that the electrode 6 anchored Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 also presented stronger absorption centered in the visible region (λ = 532 nm, see Fig. S2, ESI) than that of electrode 1.
In order to exploit the potential applications of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra thin shell nanoparticles, the photovoltaic performances of photo-anodes with a series of Au@Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles were evaluated. The thickness of all of the electrodes is the same (∼12 μm, as shown in Fig. S1, ESI). The photo-voltage and photocurrent of DSSCs based on these electrodes were characterized under the simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) and monochromatic illumination with 486.7 nm and 532.4 nm (10 mW cm−2). The related I–V curves and parameters of electrodes are summarized in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI). It was concluded that the power conversion efficiency of the electrode with the hybrid metal structure (Au@Ag@SiO2) was better than those of the single metal (Au or Ag)@SiO2. From Fig. 3b, a control photo-anode (electrode 1, pure TiO2) was fabricated using only TiO2, and the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), the energy conversion coefficient (η), and the fill factor (FF) were 13.89 mA cm−2, 678.75 mV, 6.55% and 68.82%. While, the power conversion efficiency of electrode 6 (Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2), the cell showed that Jsc, Voc, η, and FF were 16.67 mA cm−2, 675.75 mV, 7.72% and 68.16%, respectively. The short-circuit current density and photo-electric conversion efficiency of electrode 6 increased by 20.01% and 17.86% compared with electrode 1, respectively. The related I–V curves and parameters of electrodes are summarized in Table S1. Besides, due to the LSPR effect of the Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2, electrode 6 under an excitation of 330 nm obtained the highest PL intensity and a lot of excited electrons compared with others, which was beneficial to improve the photocurrent for DSSCs as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). Furthermore, considering the effect of excited monochromatic illumination on the LSPR of Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2, monochromatic illumination (486.7 nm and 532.4 nm) was chosen as a light source to research on the response of monochromatic light. From Fig. 3b, for electrode 6, Jsc, Voc and η were obtained under 486.7 nm and 532.4 nm, as shown in Table S1 (ESI). Compared to electrode 1 with pure TiO2, electrode 6 with Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 had a higher photo-electric conversion efficiency (23.42% under 486.7 nm; 20.55% under 532.4 nm). The photo-electric conversion efficiency of electrode 6 under 486.7 nm and 532.4 nm increased by 59.97% and 52.90% than electrode 1, respectively. In addition, we found that the improvement of Jsc and η under 486.7 nm was higher than under 532.4 nm. It is also illustrated the LSPR of Au@Ag@SiO2 under 486 nm is better than 532 nm, which corresponds to their UV-vis absorption.
The LSPR of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles not only enhanced the light harvesting but also improved the electron–hole separation. It was verified by the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI), the IPCE measurements further determined the monochromatic light response and the enhancement in light harvesting efficiency. The TiO2/Au@SiO2 electrode 2 showed the enhancement at 550 nm, which was consistent with the strong UV-vis absorption spectrum. At the same time, the TiO2/Ag@SiO2 (electrode 3) showed the enhancement at 400–450 nm, which was attributed to the LSPR effect of Ag nanomaterials. When Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 was introduced into the TiO2 photo-anode, the highest IPCE value was obtained because the LSPR of Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 promoted light absorption in the visible light region. And, it was further proved that the monochromatic light response and the enhancement in light harvesting efficiency of electrode 6 (Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2) at 486 nm and 532 nm are better than that of electrode 1, as shown in Fig. 3c. The lower maximum IPCE for electrode 7 (Au@Ag(25 nm)@SiO2) should be attributed to its lower dye adsorption. The effect of Au@Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles on electron transfer could be confirmed by EIS under illumination of one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) at an open circuit bias (Voc, the values are listed in Table S1, ESI), which shows the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the electrodes and the electrolyte as shown in Fig. S6a (ESI). As the charge transfer resistance (Rw) was our main concern, the tendency of Rw with series of Au@Ag@SiO2 is shown in Fig. S6b (ESI). It was worth noting that when the thickness of the Ag shell reached 15 nm, the semicircle size in the middle frequency for electrode 6 obviously decreased from 37.48 Ω for the conventional electrode to 25.24 Ω, as shown in Fig. 3d. When the Ag shell thickness reached 25 nm, the charge transfer resistance was increased. Therefore, an appropriate Ag shell thickness was vital for an efficient DSSC. Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 not only efficiently reduced the electron–hole recombination, but also decreased the charge transfer resistance.
In summary, Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles with the controllable thickness of the Ag shell were fabricated and applied into photo-anodes. The absorption peak position of the core shell structured Au@Ag@SiO2 could be tuned by the Ag shell thickness. Utilizing the Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 response to the monochromatic light (486.7 nm, 10 mW cm−2), the electrode with Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 had high photo-electric conversion efficiency (23.42%) while the electrode with Au@Ag(15 nm)@SiO2 just obtained the efficiency (7.72%) under light (100 mW cm−2). The enhancement of the photo-electric conversion efficiency was attributed to the LSPR of Au@Ag@SiO2 core–shell–ultra-thin shell nanoparticles. It is worth researching further under monochromatic illumination to broaden the applications.
