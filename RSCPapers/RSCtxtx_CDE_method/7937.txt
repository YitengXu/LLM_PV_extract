Synthesized niobium oxides (Nb2O5 and NbO2) were applied for the first time as counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The DSC using NbO2 CE showed a higher power conversion efficiency of 7.88%, compared with that of the DSC using Pt CE (7.65%).


Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are widely considered as environment-friendly, low-cost, and high power conversion efficient (η) photovoltaic devices. A DSC usually comprises a photoanode (a nanocrystalline semiconductor film sensitized by a dye), an electrolyte containing triiodide/iodide redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE, commonly Pt). Pt CE in the DSC system has been optimized thoroughly and exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward reducing triiodide. However, the scarcity and high cost of this CE greatly restrict its large-scale application in DSCs. In recent years, substantial efforts have focused on the replacement of the expensive Pt CE with readily available and highly efficient catalysts to reduce the cost of DSCs. To date, carbon materials, inorganic compounds (e.g., CoS, NiS), and conductive polymers have been introduced into DSC systems as CEs, and these materials demonstrate decent catalytic performance. Very recently, transition metal carbides and nitrides, such as Mo2C, WC,Mo2N, W2N, TiN, have also demonstrated high catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. However, only a few studies have reported on the use of metal oxides, except for WO2 developed by our group as CE in DSCs.

Niobium oxides, particularly Nb2O5, have attracted considerable attention as promising catalysts due to their excellent chemical stability and intrinsic catalytic activity. And NbO2 has been demonstrated to exhibit oxygen reduction reaction activity and used as cathode electrocatalysts for platinum-free polymer electrolyte fuel cells. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no report yet on niobium oxides as CEs in DSCs. In this communication, three Nb2O5 crystalline structures and one NbO2 crystalline structure were synthesized via a simple method. In the present study, NbO2 is synthesized for the first time without reducing gas. Then, Nb2O5 and NbO2 were used as CEs in DSCs. Results show that the synthesized niobium oxides exhibit excellent catalytic activity for triiodide reduction, and the performance of the NbO2 surpasses that of the conventional Pt.
In a simple synthesis, 1.35 g NbCl5 was dissolved in 60 mL anhydrous ethanol, followed by the addition of 0.3 g urea. The solution was vigorously stirred for 2 h and allowed to stand overnight in an open Petri dish at 50 °C, and then a gel was obtained. The as-prepared gel was annealed at 500, 800, 1000, and 1100 °C for 3 h under nitrogen, resulting in H-Nb2O5 (hexagonal), O-Nb2O5 (orthorhombic), M-Nb2O5 (monoclinic), and T-NbO2 (tetragonal), respectively. Fig. 1 shows the power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of resultant compounds. The diffraction peaks of Nb2O5 and NbO2 can be indexed to the corresponding PDF (Table S1, ESI). No other peaks of impurities were detected. The detailed peak assignments and SEM images of these samples are summarized in the ESI. In the present work, Nb2O5 underwent phase transformation during annealing, in accordance with a previous report. However, the present paper is the first to report on the transformation of Nb2O5 to NbO2 by merely increasing the annealing temperature.
To investigate the catalytic activity of the as-prepared Nb2O5 and NbO2 toward the reduction of I3−, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 acetonitrile solution with three electrodes at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Fig. 2 shows the CVs of the five (three Nb2O5, an NbO2, and a Pt) electrodes. The H, M-Nb2O5, and T-NbO2 electrodes, as well as the Pt electrode, exhibit two typical pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks, implying a high catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. The relative negative pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−, whereas the positive pair is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I2/I3− according to the literature. The profile and location of the two pairs of redox peaks for NbO2 are markedly similar to those of the Pt electrode, indicating that the former can behave similar to the latter in DSCs as a CE. The peak locations of O-Nb2O5 relatively shifted to right, and the compound also manifested the lowest current density, signifying that O-Nb2O5 has a poor catalytic activity. The CV results show that NbO2 can match the performance of Pt as a triiodide reduction catalyst, surpassing those of the three Nb2O5. From the CV results, the crystalline structures of Nb2O5 can be deduced to have a strong impact on the catalytic activity in reducing triiodide.
Subsequently, five DSCs were fabricated using three Nb2O5, an NbO2, and a Pt as CEs. Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curves of these DSCs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, and the errors are within 0.1%. The DSC with Pt CE exhibits an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 790 mV, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.06 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.69, and power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.65%. The Voc and FF of the DSC with T-NbO2 CE are slightly higher than those of the DSC with Pt CE, resulting in a higher η of 7.88%. The higher Voc could be attributed to the higher electron density that remains in the conduction band of the TiO2, raising the Fermi level, similar to the authors' previous research. Meanwhile, the DSC with O-Nb2O5 CE shows a low η of 4.55%, indicating a poor catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−, which is in good agreement with the CV results. H-Nb2O5 and M-Nb2O5 exhibit moderate photoelectric properties, and the values of η for the DSCs using CEs with these two compounds are 5.68% and 5.82%, respectively. The photovoltaic performance proves that T-NbO2 can match the performance of Pt. T-NbO2 is expected to replace the expensive Pt in the DSC as a promising CE catalyst.

To interpret the catalytic activity of the five fabricated CEs in the DSC system, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured with symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical CEs. Fig. 4a shows the EIS results in the form of Nyquist plots, which are fitted with an equivalent circuit (Fig. S2, ESI). For the two arches, the left arch represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and the corresponding double layer capacitance (Cμ), whereas the right one reflects the diffusion impedance (ZN) of the triiodide/iodide redox couple in the electrolyte. The detailed values of the EIS are summarized in Table 1. The Rct of NbO2 is merely 1.6 Ω, smaller than the value of the conventional Pt (2.5 Ω), demonstrating that NbO2 has a high catalytic activity in reducing triiodide to iodide. The detailed magnified Nyquist plots for T-NbO2 and Pt are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). In contrast, the Rct of O-Nb2O5 is 16.8 Ω, indicating a poor catalytic activity that led to a low FF and η, according to the aforementioned I–V results. The Rct of H and M-Nb2O5 are 6.1 and 3.8 Ω, respectively, indicating both compounds possess good catalytic activity. Furthermore, the four niobium oxides CEs have larger capacitance than the Pt CE due to their porous structure (Fig. S1, ESI). This property is advantageous in improving the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs. Moreover, a larger ZN is observed from the three Nb2O5 due to their mesoporous structure and thicker layer. This condition is the major factor for the relatively lower photovoltaic performance of the DSCs using Nb2O5 CEs than those using Pt CE. Similar to Pt, NbO2 has a smaller ZN, which may be attributed to the surface morphology of NbO2. As shown in the SEM image (Fig. S1, ESI), a typical honeycomb structure with a number of porous channels was molded during the NbO2 formation at high temperature. Such structures can make the redox couple diffuse smoothly in the electrolyte, confirmed by the low ZN.
To elucidate the results more accurately, Tafel-polarization was also measured using the symmetrical cells similar to those used in EIS measurements. Fig. 4b demonstrates the Tafel curves of the cells based on the five fabricated electrodes and the logarithmic current density (log J) as a function of the voltage (U). The slope of a tangent to the T-NbO2 curve is slightly higher than that of Pt, indicating that T-NbO2 shows a larger exchange current density (J0), which is in good agreement with the EIS values in terms of eqn (1). H and M-Nb2O5 also show a decent J0, whereas O-Nb2O5 shows the smallest J0, indicating a poor catalytic activity.

In summary, a simple method was used to synthesize four crystalline structures of niobium oxides (Nb2O5 and NbO2). The present work was the first to use Nb2O5 and NbO2 catalysts as CEs in the DSC system. The effect of crystalline structures on the catalytic activity was investigated. H-Nb2O5 and M-Nb2O5 showed a decent catalytic activity in reducing triiodide to iodide. The DSCs using the aforementioned materials as CEs showed higher power conversion efficiencies of 5.68% and 5.82%, achieved to 74% and 76% of that of the DSC based on Pt CE, respectively. The DSC using T-NbO2 CE exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 7.88%, matching the performance of the conventional Pt electrode. The results demonstrate that the NbO2 catalyst is a potential low-cost alternative to the noble metal Pt in the application of DSCs.
