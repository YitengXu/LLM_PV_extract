An acridine-based hole transporting material (ACR-TPA) without the spirobifluorene motif is synthesized via non complicated steps. The ACR-TPA film including Li-TFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) additives exhibits a hole mobility of 3.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the mobility of the classical spiro-MeOTAD (2.63 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and its HOMO level of −5.03 eV is slightly lower than that of spiro-MeOTAD (−4.97 eV). ACR-TPA layers with different thicknesses are applied to MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells, where power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases as the ACR-TPA layer thickness increases due to increased recombination resistance and fast charge separation. The best PCE of 16.42% is achieved from the ca. 250 nm-thick ACR-TPA, which is comparable to the PCE of 16.26% for a device with spiro-MeOTAD in the same device configuration. It is thus anticipated that ACR-TPA can be a promising alternative to spiro-MeOTAD because of its lower cost and comparable photovoltaic performance.

The first report on a solid-state perovskite solar cell with 500 h-stability without encapsulation and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% was published in 2012, which followed two pioneering studies on perovskite-sensitized solar cells reported in 2009 (ref. 2) and 2011, thus triggering perovskite photovoltaics. As a result, a certified PCE of 22.1% was demonstrated in 2016. From the device architecture point of view, perovskite solar cells can be usually constructed either using the normal or inverted layout, where the normal configuration consists of TCO/ETL/perovskite/HTL/metal (TCO = transparent conductive oxide, ETL = electron transport layer and HTL = hole transport layer), whereas the inverted configuration is composed of TCO/HTL/perovskite/ETL/metal. These structures can be further classified into mesoscopic structures or planar structures in the presence or absence of a mesoporous charge transport layer. It was also confirmed that perovskite solar cells work even without ETL or HTL. However, HTL-free perovskite solar cells demonstrate a relatively lower PCE mostly due to a lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), which suggests that the HTL is essential and a prerequisite for high efficiency perovskite solar cells. A number of hole transporting materials (HTMs) have been tested including inorganic oxides or halides, polymers and small molecules. Among the studied HTMs, polytriarylamine (PTAA), fluorine-dithiophene (FDT) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) demonstrated PCEs as high as 20–21%. HTMs for high efficiency perovskite solar cells contain similar molecular units, such as spirobifluorene or triphenylamine, which indicates that their structure and property are strongly correlated. Nevertheless, thus far, the most studied HTM is spiro-MeOTAD probably since it is commercially available, relatively inexpensive and easily forms films. In addition, the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells based on spiro-MeOTAD was reported to mostly outperform the others because the spiro-linkage offers better film quality due to its propensity not to aggregate and also suitable energy levels for better hole transfer from perovskite to the metal electrode. However, further developments of novel arch-rival HTMs to spiro-MeOTAD are needed because highly intricate synthetic strategies are required to synthesize HTMs based on the spiro-linkage, which could hamper their large scale application in perovskite solar cells. In this scenario, it is worth mentioning that HTMs based on the design approach that does not contain the spiro-linkage are an alternative solution to the widely used spirobifluorene motif. There are not many HTMs without the spiro-linkage; however they are continuously reported for perovskite solar cells such as phenoxazine based POZ2, TIPS-pentacene, carbazole based V886, X19, and SGT405, indolocarbazole based C12-carbazole, triazatruxene based HMDI and KR131, Zn phthalocyanine based TT80, diacetylide triphenylamine-based MeODATPA, tetrathiafulvalene-based TTF-1, pyrene-based Py-C, quinolizino acridine-based Fused-F, bifluorenylidene-based KR216, azomethine-based EDOT-OMeTPA, and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-based H101.

Herein, we report a novel organic small molecular HTM without the spirobifluorene motif, i.e., 4,4′-(10-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (ACR-TPA) for high efficiency perovskite solar cells. High purity ACR-TPA is successfully synthesized with yields of 60–65% using inexpensive chemicals. ACR-TPA is composed of 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (ACR) as a core unit to which two triphenylamine (TPA) groups are attached on both sides, as shown in Fig. 1. The ACR building block is extensively used in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence for organic light-emitting diodes; however, the emitting properties of ACR-based small molecules are not pertinent to this study. Nevertheless, ACR is found to be well-suited for the perovskite solar cell application. From the structural point of view, the sp3 carbon atom at the 9th position in ACR bears two methyl groups for solubility in common organic solvents. Due to the presence of both C and N atoms at the 9th and 10th positions, respectively, between the two phenyl rings, the delocalization of π-electrons between adjacent phenyl units is restricted to attain low lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and significant oxidative stability. The TPA groups ensure a good hole transporting nature as well as extend the conjugation length for the overall molecular structure. In addition, the incorporation of five methoxy (OMe) groups at the outer positions of ACR-TPA is anticipated to have a positive effect on the electronic properties, which behave as effective anchors for the interface between perovskite/HTM. ACR-TPA is applied to a normal structured perovskite solar cell and demonstrates a PCE of 16.42%, which is comparable to the PCE of 16.26% for the spiro-MeOTAD based device.

The synthetic scheme (Fig. 1) and procedures used to prepare ACR-TPA are presented in the Experimental section. First, 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine was reacted with 4-iodo anisole under Buchwald–Hartwig coupling to give the key intermediate 1 in 70% yield. Intermediate 1 was brominated using NBS, followed by effective boronation of compound 2 using bis(pinacolato)diboron to provide the key predecessor compound 3. Eventually, ACR-TPA was obtained by the Suzuki coupling of compound 3 and 4-bromo-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline in yields exceeding 60%. The molecular structure of ACR-TPA was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1). The NMR data is consistent with the desired structure. Herein, it is worth noting that the cost for the synthesis of ACR-TPA is much cheaper than that of spiro-MeOTAD. Spirobifluorene (∼131.7 USD per g) is an expensive core unit because the synthesis of this material requires several synthetic steps and an expensive starting material (2-aminobiphenyl: 12.3 USD per g). However, in the case of ACR-TPA, the cost for the synthesis of the ACR backbone is quite cheaper using N-phenylanthranilic acid (∼1.8 USD per g) than that using spirobifluorene, which makes ACR-TPA an efficient and inexpensive material compared to spiro-MeOTAD. The lab synthesis cost of ACR-TPA is calculated to be approximately half of the cost of spiro-MeOTAD. Therefore, ACR-TPA can be readily prepared in larger quantities with high yield against the commonly used spiro-MeOTAD. Despite the non-spiro structural architecture of ACR-TPA, which differs from the 3D structure of spiro-MeOTAD, ACR-TPA possesses excellent solubility in organic solvents, which makes it an efficient HTM for solution processable perovskite solar cells.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of ACR-TPA in chloroform (CF) and thin film state are shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption bands of ACR-TPA in the wavelength region between 300 and 400 nm are considered as the π–π* transitions of the π-conjugated system. ACR-TPA shows an absorption maximum at 366 nm in solution and 371 nm in the film state and a weak vibronic shoulder peak at 302 nm in both solution and film states. It is interesting to note that the absorption pattern of ACR-TPA is similar in both the solution and film states, which indicates that little aggregation is expected in the form of thin film. It is worth stating that the slightly weak absorption of ACR-TPA in the visible region compared to spiro-MeOTAD is truly beneficial in terms of subduing the incident photon loss absorbed by the HTM. In comparison with the absorption maximum of spiro-MeOTAD (385 nm), the maximum of ACR-TPA (366 nm) is moderately blue shifted, which indicates slightly weakened conjugation in ACR-TPA than that of spiro-MeOTAD. From the abovementioned absorption profiles, it could be confirmed that ACR-TPA will not interfere with the perovskite layer in the light absorbing process. The band gap of ACR-TPA is estimated from the onset of the thin film absorption spectrum and found to be 2.98 eV. In the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of ACR-TPA, shown in Fig. 2a, the emission maximum of ACR-TPA in CF solution is observed at 418 nm with a small Stokes shift of 52 nm. The HOMO level of ACR-TPA is important when considering hole transfer from perovskite to ACR-TPA, which is determined from cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 2b. Based on the HOMO and optical band gap, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be estimated. The optical data and HOMO–LUMO energies are listed in Table 1.

Thermal stability is also a key aspect for the stability and robustness of HTMs. The thermal properties of ACR-TPA are shown in Fig. 2c. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques were used to estimate the thermal stability of ACR-TPA. The TGA and DSC measurements demonstrate that ACR-TPA displays excellent thermal stability with a high thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of 430 °C and glass transition temperature (Tg) of 120 °C. The abovementioned thermal results specify that ACR-TPA is amorphous and has a thermal stability analogous to that of spiro-MeOTAD.
The energy level diagram of the perovskite and ACR-TPA with respect to the electrode contacts is shown in Fig. 3. The HOMO and LUMO of ACR-TPA are calculated to be −5.03 and −2.05 eV, respectively. The HOMO of ACR-TPA (−5.03 eV) is slightly lower than that of spiro-MeOTAD (−4.97 eV) and higher than the valence band maximum (VBM) of the MAPbI3 perovskite (−5.43 eV), which indicates that ACR-TPA has favorable energetics for hole extraction. Since the HOMO level is determined for the HTLs including additives, there is a slight discrepancy in the HOMO level (−5.22 eV) for the pristine spiro-MeOTAD reported elsewhere. The proper alignment of the HOMO energy level with the VBM of perovskite also permits holes to be extracted from the perovskite layer to the metal electrode. In addition, the large energy barrier of about 1.88 eV between the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MAPbI3 and LUMO energy level of ACR-TPA is anticipated to lock the electron backflow.
For testing ACR-TPA as the HTL layer in a perovskite solar cell, the normal planar structure was adapted, where PCBM is inserted between the TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2) and MAPbI3 in order to reduce J–V hysteresis. Devices based on FTO/bl-TiO2/PCBM/MAPbI3/ACR-TPA/Au were prepared and their photovoltaic performances were compared with those composed of spiro-MeOTAD. First, we investigated the thickness effect of ACR-TPA on photovoltaic performance, where the thickness of the ACR-TPA layer was varied by controlling the precursor concentration from 60 mM to 120 mM without changing the spin-coating speed. The cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 4 clearly show that the ACR-TPA layer increases with precursor concentration. The mean thickness of the ACR-TPA layer is determined to be 160 nm, 200 nm, 250 nm, and 300 nm for the concentration of 60 mM, 80 mM, 100 mM, and 120 mM, respectively. The HTL layer increases by about 50 nm as concentration increases by 20 mM at the given spin-coating condition. Pinhole-free ACR-TPA layers are formed in the relatively thin ACR-TPA layers, whereas pinholes are developed as the thickness increases, probably due to gas bubbles and/or solvent-free aggregates formed in the high concentration solution. The MAPbI3 layer thickness is determined to be about 440 nm for all the samples. Since the presence of pinholes in the thicker ACR-TPA layer is likely to affect stability, we investigated the stability of the device with a 250 nm-thick ACR-TPA layer with pinholes under continuous illumination in air atmosphere, where the device is not encapsulated. Fig. S2 shows the photovoltaic parameters as a function of exposure time. After continuous exposure for 170 min, the power conversion efficiency of the ACR-TPA based device is degraded by about 48%, whereas the spiro-MeOTAD based perovskite solar cell shows relatively smaller degradation. The rapid degradation of the ACR-TPA case is probably attributed to the presence of pinholes in the ACR-TPA layer. Moisture can penetrate into the perovskite layer through the pinholes, which might lead to the acceleration of degradation or decomposition of the perovskite. Removal of the pinholes is expected to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells with ACR-TPA.
For the photovoltaic studies, additives were added to ACR-TPA to increase the mobility. The hole mobility of the ACR-TPA film with additives of Li-TFSI and tBP is estimated to be 3.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the hole mobility of 2.63 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the additive including spiro-MeOTAD (Fig. S3). Fig. 5 shows the effect of the ACR-TPA thickness on the photovoltaic parameters. The data shown in Fig. 5 are the mean values of the forward and reverse scanned short-circuit current density (Jsc), Voc, FF and PCE at the voltage settling time of 200 ms under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination. The average Jsc is 20.4 mA cm−2 for the 160 nm-thick ACR-TPA, which increases to 22 mA cm−2 for the 200 nm-thick ACR-TPA and then slightly decreases to 21.7 mA cm−2 for the 250 nm-thick ACR-TPA and subsequently to 20.7 mA cm−2 for the 300 nm-thick ACR-TPA. On the other hand, the Voc increases with ACR-TPA thickness, is maximized at 250 nm and then slightly decreases. The highest Voc of 1.07 V is obtained from the 250 nm-thick ACR-TPA layer. Except for the 300 nm-thick ACR-TPA layer, FF is not significantly altered by the ACR-TPA thickness. The low FF of 0.57 at the 300 nm-thick layer is due to the increase in series resistance. The average PCE of 15.6% is achieved from the 250 nm-thick ACR-TPA layer.
In order to understand the Voc enhancement with ACR-TPA layer thickness, an impedance spectroscopic study was carried out. The high frequency resistance (Rh) and recombination resistance (Rrec) are extracted from the Nyquist plot (Fig. S4). The Rh in Fig. 6a is related to the carrier transport in selective contacts or their interfaces. No significant difference in Rh with ACR-TPA layer thickness indicates that the carrier transport at the selective contacts is not influenced by the ACR-TPA layer thickness. The Rrec in Fig. 6b reflects a recombination process closely related to the perovskite material, where Rrec at a low bias potential correlates with the perovskite interface or perovskite bulk. A higher Rrec is expected to lead to a higher Voc due to lower recombination. The Rrecs for the 200 nm- and 250 nm-thick ACR-TPA layers are five times higher than that for the 160 nm-thick layer, which is responsible for the increase in the mean Voc from 0.99 V for the 160 nm-thick layer to 1.03 V for the 200 nm and 1.045 V for 250 nm-thick layers. The highest Rrec is observed for the 300 nm-thick ACR-TPA layer, which may not explain the mean Voc of 1.035 V. However, 75% of the data (3rd quartile in the box chart corresponding to the upper edge of the box) shows a Voc of 1.055 V for the 300 nm-thick ACR-TPA layer, which correlates with the high Rrec. It can be thus said that recombination at the MAPbI3/ACR-TPA interface can be suppressed by increasing the ACR-TPA layer thickness. Nevertheless, the optimal thickness of ACR-TPA ranges between 200 nm and 250 nm when considering Jsc and FF.
To understand charge separation depending on ACR-TPA layer thickness, steady-state and time-resolved PL (TRPL) were measured, and the results are displayed in Fig. 7. The PL of MAPbI3 is quenched upon contacting ACR-TPA, as can be seen in Fig. 7a, where the PL intensity decreases as the ACR-TPA thickness increases. This indicates that the holes in MAPbI3 are more efficiently separated as the ACR-TPA layer thickness increases, which is consistent with increase in Voc. However, the PL is abnormally less quenched for the 300 nm-thick ACR-TPA, which may be related to the optical interference effect observed in organic light-emitting diodes. The charge separation kinetics is studied from the TRPL in Fig. 7b, where the PL decay is fitted with the biexponential decay eqn (1):
I(t) = I0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2
(1)
where
τ1 and τ2 denote the fast and slow decay times, respectively, A1 and A2 represent the amplitude factor and I0 is the offset. In the biexponential decay process, PL decay is related to the recombination kinetics, where the short-lived life time (τ1) in the fast component correlates with the surface property and/or non-radiative recombination whereas the long-lived life time (τ2) in the slow component is related to the bulk property. The best fitted results are listed in Table 2. Pristine MAPbI3 without ACR-TPA shows a τ1 of 1.7 ns (R1 = 77%) and τ2 of 11.8 ns (R2 = 23%), whereas both τ1 and τ2 decrease when MAPbI3 is in contact with ACR-TPA due to charge separation. In addition, the τ1 of 0.85 ns and τ2 of 3.6 ns for the 160 nm-thick ACR-TPA decrease to 0.67 ns and 3.4 ns for the 200 nm-thick ACR-TPA, and 0.48 ns and 2.4 ns for the 250 nm-thick ACR-TPA. Such a decrease in carrier life time with an increase in ACR-TPA layer thickness is indicative of more efficient and faster charge separation, except for the 300 nm-thick ACR-TPA, which is well consistent with the change in Voc with ACR-TPA thickness. The average PL life time (τPL), calculated from the amplitude fraction, is estimated to be 4.0 ns for pristine MAPbI3, which decreases to 1.4, 1.1 and 0.9 ns as the ACR-TPA layer increases to 160, 200 and 250 nm, respectively, which indicates that hole extraction is more accelerated not only at the surface but also in the bulk perovskite upon contacting the thicker ACR-TPA. For the case of the 300 nm-thick ACR-TPA layer, the τPL of 1.7 ns is still faster than that of perovskite without ACR-TPA but unexpectedly slower than that with the other thicknesses. Since this unusual behavior is hard to explain when considering the Voc change, we measured the TRPL several times with different samples but observed similar results. Further study is thus required to explain such an abnormal phenomenon.

Fig. 8 compares the J–V curves of the ACR-TPA based perovskite solar cell with the conventional spiro-MeOTAD based solar cell, where the cell configuration is identical for both devices. The optimized thickness of the HTL is 150 nm for spiro-MeOTAD and 250 nm for ACR-TPA, where the Li-TFSI and tBP additives are included. The average photovoltaic parameters obtained from the forward and reverse scanned data are listed in Table 3. Both devices show almost negligible J–V hysteresis because of the presence of PCBM. The perovskite solar cell based on ACR-TPA demonstrates an average Jsc of 22.00 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.032 V, FF of 0.72 and PCE of 16.42%, whereas the cell with spiro-MeOTAD shows an average Jsc of 21.71 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.018 V, FF of 0.74 and PCE of 16.26%. The photovoltaic performance for ACR-TPA is comparable to that for spiro-MeOTAD. It is noted that the ACR-TPA based cell exhibits a 14 mV higher Voc than the spiro-MeOTAD based cell, which is ascribed to its lower HOMO level. Moreover, steady-state PL confirms better charge separation at the MAPbI3/ACR-TPA interface than at MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD (Fig. S5), which also contributes to the higher Voc.

Fig. 9 shows the statistical comparison of the photovoltaic parameters for the ACR-TPA based device with the spiro-MeOTAD based device. The average values of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are determined to be 20.86 mA cm−2, 1.03 V, 0.68 and 14.68%, respectively, for the ACR-TPA based device. Although its FF is lower than spiro-MeOTAD (0.70), the PCE for ACR-TPA is slightly higher than that of the spiro-MeOTAD based device (14.42%) due to the higher Jsc and Voc compared to that for spiro-MeOTAD (20.15 mA cm−2 and 1.02 V, respectively). Along with the best performing data, the average photovoltaic performance for the ACR-TPA based devices is comparable to or slightly higher than that for the spiro-MeOTAD based devices.

We successfully synthesized a new, simple and non-spiro small molecule HTM (ACR-TPA) with a 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine core for high performance perovskite solar cells. The hole mobility and band energetics of ACR-TPA are well suited for its use as a hole transporting material in perovskite solar cells. The charge separation kinetics and recombination resistance were found to be dependent on the thickness of ACR-TPA layer contacting with the perovskite film, from which the ACR-TPA thickness of about 250 nm is proposed to be optimal. Since the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell employing the cost-effective ACR-TPA is comparable to that with the more expensive spiro-MeOTAD, ACR-TPA is expected to be a promising alternative to spiro-MeOTAD for perovskite solar cells.


9,9-Dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine and 4-bromo-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline were synthesized according to the reported literature procedures.


9,9-Dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (0.5 g, 2.3 mmol), 4-iodoanisole (0.6 g, 2.3 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.066 g, 0.12 mmol), P(t-Bu)3 (0.1 mL, 0.18 mmol) and NaOt-Bu (0.463 g, 4.63 mmol) were dissolved in 40 mL of toluene and stirred at 120 °C for 12 h. After termination of the reaction, the mixture was neutralized with distilled water and extracted with ethyl acetate (EA). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. Subsequently, the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/EA (10:1) as the eluent to afford 10-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine as a white solid. Yield (0.52 g, 70%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.44 (d, 4H), 7.22 (s, 1H), 7.14 (d, 2H), 6.94 (m, 5H), 6.32 (d, 2H), 3.92 (s, 3H), 1.67 (s, 6H).



N-Bromosuccinimide (94.5 g, 3.17 mmol) was added in portions to a solution of 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (0.5 g, 1.58 mmol) in chloroform (CF) (30 mL) at 0 °C under dark conditions, and the mixture was stirred at this temperature for 2 h. 60 mL of water was subsequently added to the mixture. The reaction was quenched with water, extracted with CF, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/EA (5:1) as the eluent to afford 2,7-dibromo-10-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine as a colorless solid. Yield (0.6 g, 80%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.48 (d, 2H), 7.14 (m, 4H), 7.04 (dd, 2H), 6.18 (d, 2H), 3.92 (s, 3H), 1.67 (s, 6H).


A solution of 2 (1 g, 2.1 mmol), bis(pinacolato)diboron (1.18 g, 4.6 mmol ratio), KOAc (1.03 g, 10 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (30 mg, 0.14 mmol) in dry toluene (20 mL) was refluxed at 110 °C under an N2 atmosphere for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water (20 mL) and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Then the solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/EA (3:1) as the eluent to afford 10-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,10-dihydroacridine as a colorless solid.

To a solution of 3 (0.8 g, 1.41 mmol), 4-bromo-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (1.38 g, 3.59 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (95 mg, 0.08 mmol), and tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (1.36 g, 3.5 mmol) in distilled tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) was added aqueous Na2CO3 (2 M, 10 mL) under an N2 atmosphere, then the mixture was refluxed for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 30 mL deionized water and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (60 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Then the solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane/EA (1:1) as the eluent to afford ACR-TPA as a yellow solid.

A compact blocking TiO2 layer (bl-TiO2) was spin-coated on cleaned FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) using the precursor solution of 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in 2-propanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) at 2800 rpm for 20 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 h, on which a PCBM solution (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 1200 rpm for 1 min prior to the deposition of the perovskite layer. A 52 wt% perovskite solution was prepared by mixing CH3NH3I (0.159 g), PbI2 (0.461 g) and DMSO (71 μL) in the DMF (521 μL), which was spin-coated on the PCBM layer at 4000 rpm for 25 s. While spinning, diethyl ether was dripped on the substrate to induce an acid–base adduct intermediate. The adduct film was heated at 65 °C for 1 min to eliminate the DMSO and finally at 100 °C for 9 min to form a perovskite phase. 120 mM ACR-TPA stock solution was prepared by dissolving 110.65 mg ACR-TPA in 1 mL chlorobenzene, which was diluted to make different concentrations of 60, 80 and 100 mM. Additives were added to the ACR-TPA stock solution with 38 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) and 48.4 μL tBP. The ACR-TPA layer was formed by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. For comparison, a spiro-MeOTAD coating solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD (Merck) in 1 mL chlorobenzene, where 17.5 μL Li-TFSI and 28.8 μL tBP were added. Finally, an Au counter electrode with a thickness of about 60 nm was deposited using a thermal evaporator.



1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury Plus 300 MHz spectrometer (USA) in CDCl3 using tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. The chemical shifts were recorded in ppm relative to the singlets of CDCl3 at 7.26 and 77 ppm for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer (USA). Thermal analysis was carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e (Switzerland), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out using a DSC 3822e analyzer under an N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were carried out with a CHI 600C potentiostat (CH Instruments), which was equipped with a platinum disc as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in a 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) in anhydrous acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte. The J–V curves were measured under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3 A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. One sun light intensity was adjusted using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-2 filter. Time-integrated and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) were measured using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, HAMAMATSU). Films were photo-excited with a 464 nm laser (PLP-10, HAMAMATSU) pulsed at the frequency of 2 MHz. PL was detected by high sensitivity photon counting near the IR detector. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) characterization was conducted using a PGSTAT 128N (Autolab, Eco-Chemie) in the dark. The DC bias voltage range was from 0 V to 1.0 V and the potential step was 0.1 V.
