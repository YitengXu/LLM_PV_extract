Recently, all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite solar cells have stimulated enormous research interest due to their numerous merits including superior thermal and light stability and have become one of the most prominent research domains. In the past decade, the reported power conversion efficiency exhibited a rapid rise increasing from 2.9% to the present 20.8%. This review provides a summary of the recent exciting advancements in film quality optimization engineering and the investigations of the film formation mechanism of CsPbX3 perovskites, aiming to further promote the device performance towards the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit. We begin with the introduction of the fundamental mechanism analysis of perovskite crystallization kinetics and evaluate the predominant pathways that contribute to non-radiative recombination losses. We subsequently summarize the promising strategies for fabricating high-quality CsPbX3 perovskite films with a particular focus on film formation regulation engineering and defect suppression approaches. Furthermore, we highlight state-of-the-art characterization techniques such as in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to probe the film formation kinetics to fulfill the purpose of understanding the underlying film formation mechanism. Finally, we provide an outlook on the challenges and opportunities for further promoting the device performance and cover the issues relating to the commercial application of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells in the future.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in recent years owing to their impressive photovoltaic performance. However, potential obstacles of future commercialization still need to be explored in view of the stability issues. It is worth noting that all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) materials exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties and outstanding thermal stability. The tunable optical band gap (1.7–2.3 eV) of CsPbX3 offers wide application domains, such as being the top cell in tandem devices and semitransparent solar cells. The power conversion efficiency has increased from 2.9% to 20.8% up to now. In order to further optimize the photovoltaic performance of CsPbX3 PSCs, it is important to optimize the perovskite film quality, but this has proven challenging from the point of crystallization kinetics modulation and defect suppression. This review gives an insightful overview of recent progress in all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite solar cells, and proposes topical issues of optimization engineering of film quality and the investigations of the film formation mechanism. It is also the first comprehensive summary of the literature on defect physics mechanism and the state-of-the-art characterization techniques. Especially, in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) in the all-inorganic perovskite research field has been highlighted and discussed.


In recent years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to their impressive photovoltaic performance. To date, they have achieved a certified champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of greater than 25%, outperforming copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) (PCE = 23.4%), CdTe (PCE = 22.1%), and multicrystalline Si (PCE = 22.8%) solar cells. The perovskite materials are highly favorable for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties such as the superior long carrier diffusion length and high optical absorption coefficient. Despite the stellar rise of the organic–inorganic PSCs, their long-term stability is still poor when compared with the established photovoltaic technology and conflicts with the practical commercialization requirements. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials would be prone to decompose under moisture and thermal stresses owing to the employment of highly volatile organic cations like methylammonium cations (MA+) or formamidinium cations (FA+). On the other hand, all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites exhibit superior thermal stability and photoelectric properties when replacing the unstable organic cations with robust inorganic cesium (Cs+) ions. Besides, their optical band gap is tunable within 1.7–3.0 eV via the halogen composition regulating engineering which provides large flexibility towards light management. This can enhance the utilization ratio of the solar energy and offer great application potential of being semitransparent PSCs in the area of building-integrated photovoltaics and tandem solar cells (Fig. 1c). Thus, CsPbX3 based PSCs have become a research hotspot in the field of photovoltaics.

Since Snaith et al. reported the initial 2.9% PCE of CsPbI3-based PSCs in 2015, significant progress has been made in all-inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs during the past decade and the PCE has rapidly surged to over 20% up to now. Nonetheless, the all-inorganic PSCs are still at the early stage of development and face challenges for commercial employment. The observed PCE still lags far behind that of the organic–inorganic PSCs and falls short of the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) radiative limit theoretical value (∼30%). One significant feature of CsPbX3 PSCs is the large open-circuit voltage (Voc) deficit (Eg/q − Voc, where Eg is the optical bandgap and q is the elementary charge). It is noted that the Voc deficit of CsPbX3 PSCs (∼0.6 eV) is much larger than that of FA or MA based organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs (∼0.3 eV), indicating that Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is much serious in the photoactive layer or the interfaces in these devices. Optimizing the quality of the perovskite films (coverage, morphology, crystal orientation) and suppressing the defect-related nonradiative recombination are the basis of mitigating the Voc deficit. The high film coverage is believed to promote adequate light absorption and avoid current leakage. The large crystal domains and high orientation of the crystals ensure efficient carrier transportation. Besides, numerous research reports have also confirmed that the CsPbX3 quality is strongly associated with phase structure stability. The high-quality CsPbX3 film could hinder the structural collapse from the black perovskite phase (α-phase, β-phase, γ-phase) into the non-perovskite phase (δ-phase) to some extent (Fig. 1a and b). In this regard, the fabrication of high-quality CsPbX3 perovskite films is regarded as an essential pathway for effectively boosting the PCE towards the S–Q radiative limit and simultaneously enhancing the perovskite phase structure stability.
The CsPbX3 perovskite films are feasibly obtained by a cost-effective and facile solution-processable manufacturing method, while the nucleation and growth process are largely uncontrollable and the defects inevitably arise from the conventional coating procedure. The underlying film formation evolution mechanism in terms of the nucleation and growth process needs to be identified, which is an important prerequisite for precisely tuning the film crystallization kinetics and obtaining the high-quality CsPbX3 film. State-of-the-art synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) is a powerful technique to dig into the thin film ordered structures at the molecular level. In situ GIWAXS could collect the real time crystal diffraction information and be utilized for probing the underlying film crystallization kinetics, which enable us to obtain an in-depth understanding of the basic film formation mechanism. According to the above-mentioned analysis, therefore, it is urgently imperative to summarize the current development of the CsPbX3 PSCs in terms of film quality optimization engineering and the investigations of the film formation mechanism and its correlated characterization techniques.
Herein, we focus on reviewing a specific aspect of the recent efforts in developing crystal growth modulation and defect passivation methodologies in all-inorganic PSCs and discuss the advanced measurement techniques that can be utilized to quantify the perovskite crystallization kinetics. In the first section, the fundamental mechanism including the film nucleation and growth mechanism and defect-assisted non-radiative recombination losses are briefly introduced. In the second section, we summarize the practical strategies for preparing high-quality perovskite films including solvent engineering, additive engineering, component engineering, dimension engineering, and interface engineering. In the third section, we outline the in situ GIWAXS characterization technique that can be utilized to analyze the film formation process. In the last section, we discuss the steps that should be undertaken to optimize the film quality and boost PCEs towards the S–Q radiative limits and offer the perspectives for promoting the commercial development of all-inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs in the future. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current challenges regarding the film growth process modulation and defect passivation in the field of CsPbX3 PSCs, aiming to further optimize the film quality and stability and promote the future investigation of the underlying film growth mechanisms.

In this section, we briefly retrospect the fundamental mechanisms of film formation and material defect generation/suppression, which are the basis of how to optimize the crystal growth and passivate material defects. These theories can offer pivotal guidance for film growth modulation and high-performance device fabrication.


The perovskite crystal growth is a kinetic process of nucleation and crystallization, relying on LaMer and Ostwald ripening models. An in-depth understanding of the models is a prerequisite for modulating the all-inorganic perovskite film morphology.


An in-depth understanding of the fundamental film formation process is primary for modulating the perovskite crystal growth kinetics. Generally, the perovskite film formation process is a combination of the nucleation and crystal growth process. Nucleation is triggered in a supersaturated state (the solute concentration is higher than the solubility limit). Nucleation can be classified into homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation. In homogeneous nucleation, nuclei are formed in solution without preferential nucleation sites and can be considered in thermodynamics terms. As shown in Fig. 2a, the total free energy (ΔG) of a nucleus is defined as the sum of the surface free energy (ΔGs) and the bulk free energy (ΔGv). The surface free energy is the energy between the particle bulk and surface and is correlated to the radius (r) of the nucleus and per unit area (γ). ΔGv is defined as the free energy difference between the monomer in crystal and in solution and is dependent on the r of the nucleus, the molar volume of the nucleus (ν), and the degree of supersaturation in solution (S). The free energy of a nucleus can be defined as given by equation 1. Taking the positive ΔGs and the negative bulk free energy ΔGv into consideration, the classical free energy diagram for homogeneous nucleation as a function of particle radius is plotted. The critical radius (r*) is the marginal value that determines the nucleation behavior. When the nucleus size is larger than r*, the nuclei are thermodynamically stable and grow further; on the other hand, when the nucleus size is smaller than r*, the nuclei would redissolve into solution. In the case of heterogeneous nucleation, nuclei are formed at nucleation sites like the substrate or suspended particles. Compared with the homogeneous nucleation, the nucleation process is much easier due to the reduced nucleation barrier.

J = 4πr2k[C]s − [C]r

Upon the formation of nuclei, crystal growth subsequently occurs through two processes including solute diffusion-controlled growth and surface reaction. Concerning diffusion-controlled growth, the monomer diffusion from the solution to the nucleus surface is described by Fick's first law as shown in eqn (2), where J, r, D, and C refer to the total flux of monomers, the particle radius, the diffusion coefficient, and the monomer concentration at a distance from the surface (x), respectively. Given the steady state of the solute diffusion, J at the surface of the particles can be further derived as eqn (3), where [C]b indicates the bulk concentration of monomers in solution and [C]s denotes the concentration of the solute at the particle/solution interface.
In the case of attachment of the monomer through the surface reaction, the monomer consumption rate at the particle surface by the particle growth can be described as eqn (4), where k is the rate of surface reaction and [C]r denotes the solubility of the spherical particle with radius r. It implies that the larger nucleus would have an accelerated surface reaction rate. As shown in the diffusion- and reaction-controlled growth modes (Fig. 2c), the diffusion-controlled growth has an obvious effect on promoting the formation of uniform size particles on the basis of the steady state of solute diffusion. Conversely, the monomer concentration at the particle surface is nearly the same as in the bulk solution indicating the slow surface reaction rate.

The overall nucleation and crystal growth processes can be depicted by a classical LaMer mechanism, which can be divided into three stages: (I) pre-nucleation stage; (II) nucleation stage; and (III) growth stage. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the precursor concentration changes as a function of time along with the constant solvent evaporation. In stage I, the monomers are initially accumulated in solution but nucleation has not yet taken place. In stage II, the supersaturation environment is created for nucleation upon the monomer concentration reaching a critical level (Cmin). The nucleation rate is accelerated when the monomer concentration reaches the maximum level (Cmax). In stage III, with the monomer concentration reaching levels lower than Cmin due to the consumption of monomers, nucleation is terminated accompanied by crystal growth in the meantime. Eventually, the crystal growth is terminated, when the concentration of monomers is close to the solubility level (Cs). The LaMer mechanism offers a basic understanding of the film formation process. The overall nucleation and crystal growth processes both complement each other. From the thermodynamics point of view, it can be deduced that the short nucleation step accompanied by a deferred crystal growth process would give rise to high-quality films with large grains and fewer defects, which in turn increase both efficiency and stability of the PSCs.


The Ostwald ripening mechanism is another fundamental model which could be employed to elucidate the perovskite grain growth process. Particles of different size dispersed in solution show competitive growth due to the different monomer concentrations surrounding the particles. As depicted in Fig. 2d, based on the thermodynamic Gibbs–Thompson mechanism, the small-size particles with a high chemical potential tend to dissolve and re-deposit on the surface of the large-size particles. The large particles with a lower chemical potential could grow further. Therefore, the average radius of the particle increases during this coalescence process.


Given the simple processability of perovskite materials, unintentional defects are inevitably formed during the nucleation and crystal growth process. We offer an in-depth understanding of the all-inorganic perovskite materials’ defects and defect-related non-radiative recombination principles, which indicate that the defect suppression is an essential factor in constructing high-performance PSCs.


For a perfect ideal crystal, all atoms in the lattice of the perovskite are on their equilibrium sites. Nevertheless, in realistic conditions, diverse defects are inevitably formed during the solution procedure and annealing treatment at high temperatures. Generally, the material defects can be distinguished into three categories: point defects (zero-dimensional (0D) defects), line defects (one-dimensional (1D) defects), and plane defects (two-dimensional (2D) defects). The point defects include vacancy defects (atoms missing from the lattice), interstitial defects (atoms occupying the lattice interstitial), and anti-site substitution defects (atoms occupying the site of other atoms in the lattice). Line defects are pertaining to the dislocations in perovskite crystals. Plane defects include grain boundary and surface defects. Taking CsPbX3 as an example, the possible point defects are vacancies (VCs, VPb, VX), interstitials (Csi, Pbi, Xi), and anti-site substitutions (CsPb, CsX, PbCs, PbX, XCs, XPb) (Fig. 3a).

The defects can also be distinguished into shallow-level defects and deep-level defects according to the state of the defect energy level in the energy band gap. Although the shallow level traps may not be detrimental to photovoltaic performance, they induce hysteresis and phase segregation due to the migration of point defects under an electric field. The deep-level defects are in the middle levels within the band gap where the electrons or holes could be captured and have been identified as Shockley–Read–Hall nonradiative-recombination sources. Chen et al. presented a systematic study of defect physics in the CsPbI2Br perovskite via the density functional mechanism (DFT) calculations (Fig. 3b). Only six point defects including ICs, IPb, BrCs, BrPb, PbBr, and PbI induce deep level defects and all others are related to shallow level defects. Further deep analysis confirmed that VCs, VPb, Bri, Ii and CsPb play the role of shallow acceptors whereas PbCs, Pbi, VBr, VI, Csi, CsBr and CsI are shallow donors. Park et al. carried out theoretical studies to analyze the trap states at grain boundaries in the CsPbI3 perovskite. They point out that the grain boundaries can promote point defect formation and facilitate the charge carrier recombination at deep trap levels (Fig. 3c).
It is thermodynamically favorable to form the defects within the film spontaneously when its formation energy is negative. Both atomic chemical potential and electronic chemical potential exert a synergistic effect on the formation energy. It is noted that the atomic chemical potential is contingent on the concentrations and activity of reactants. From this point of view, the crystal would possess varied defect structures under the different film formation processes and growth conditions. Thus, the crystal growth modulation and defect suppression are pivotal to facilitate the formation of a high-quality perovskite film with large grains and fewer defects.

We go over the current understanding of the origin of the carrier recombination loss in PSCs with a particular focus on intrinsic defect-assisted recombination and its effect on device performance.

For a device in ideal working conditions, the carriers could be excited under continuous sunlight illumination and separated under the driving force from the built-in electric field originating from the potential difference between quasi-Fermi levels for electrons and holes. Whilst the photogenerated carriers also undergo defect-assisted recombination process (Fig. 3d). The time-dependent carrier population neglecting the diffusion effect can be given by eqn (5), where k1, k2, and k3 are the rate constants that represent defect-assisted (monomolecular), radiative (bimolecular) and Auger (three-body) recombination processes, respectively. n is the photo-generated carrier density. Theoretically, both defect-assisted recombination and Auger recombination contribute to non-radiative recombination losses. While Auger recombination in PSCs may be the secondary effect which predominantly occurs under limited conditions of high carrier concentrations (>1017 cm−3), the defect-assisted recombination is the major non-radiative recombination pathway that drastically impairs the carrier dynamics. The long carrier recombination lifetime contributes to a larger Voc, thereby enhancing the overall PCE of the operation device, which is described by eqn (6).k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elemental charge, JSC is the short-circuit current density, Jsc is the initial current density, ND is the doping concentration, τeff is the effective carrier recombination lifetime, ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration and d is the thickness of the light absorber. In addition, the defect-assisted recombination is highly related to the defect state level depth within the band gap and the defect density. Deep-level traps are the predominant sources that capture electrons and holes leading to severe non-radiative recombination losses. Shallow-level traps have a negligible impact on non-radiative decay but still affect the hysteresis and phase segregation of perovskite materials. Therefore, in order to minimize the energy loss triggered by unwanted non-radiative recombination, optimizing the perovskite film quality and passivating the extended defects are desirable, ultimately acting to mitigate the Voc deficit and improve the device performance.

Controlling the perovskite growth process and suppressing defect formation are desirable for constructing high-quality perovskite films. In this section, key insights into a variety of appealing strategies for fabricating high-quality all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite films including crystallization regulation and defect passivation have been summarized.


In the solution-processed fabrication method of perovskites, the first nucleation step is highly related to the supersaturation condition of the solute in the precursor solvent. The following crystal grain growth is driven by solvent evaporation. To fulfill the purpose of engendering a high-quality perovskite film with a larger crystalline grain size, facilitating the formation of dense nucleation sites and controlling the crystal grain growth rate within a suitable range are critical. Hence the preparation technology should be first taken into consideration since it affects the resultant morphology of the prepared film. Some effective methods in terms of solvent engineering have been summarized in this section.


The conventional perovskite precursor solution with slow evaporation typically generates low-density nuclei during the spin coating procedure due to a limited degree of supersaturation, which is detrimental to the formation of compact film morphology. The introduction of an anti-solvent treatment during the spin-coating procedure effectively induces instant supersaturation of the precursor owing to the non-polar solvent that is insoluble with the perovskite precursor. Thereby, it contributes to accelerating the nucleation and ensures uniform film formation with full surface coverage. Chen et al. developed effective anti-solvent engineering for fabricating a high-quality inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite absorber by using a green solvent, namely, ethyl acetate (EA) (Fig. 4a). The perovskite morphologies are remarkably improved after the EA anti-solvent treatment due to the accelerated film formation procedure. They also compared the treatment effectiveness of EA solvent and conventional chlorobenzene (CB) solvent. The perovskite film with EA treatment presents better crystalline quality compared with the CB treatment because CB has a higher boiling point than EA which may hence remain as a residue in the perovskite precursor film and affect the crystal growth during the annealing process. Chen et al. utilized green anti-solvent isopropanol (IPA) to optimize the morphology of the CsPbI2Br film (Fig. 4b). They claimed that IPA could wash away the residual DMSO and eliminate the edge solvent effect due to its appropriate volatility and viscosity. A champion PCE of 16.07% was achieved for CsPbI2Br PSCs. Zhang et al. systematically dug into the roles of six kinds of antisolvents including CB, IPA, EA, dichloromethane (DCM), toluene (TOL), and diethyl ether (DEE). The CsPbIBr2 film with DEE antisolvent treatment exhibited the best morphology with a homogeneous, pin-hole-free and well-crystallized surface.


Controlling the crystal growth process is essential to the formation of perovskite films of ideal morphology with larger grains and fewer pinholes. Based on this concept, solvent-controlled growth engineering is proposed to balance the solvent evaporation and defer the crystal growth rate. Trace solvent diffusing around the perovskite film is soluble with the perovskite precursors and creates a wet environment. Wang et al. allowed the precursor film to stand in a dry nitrogen environment for several ten minutes before annealing (Fig. 4d). They claimed that this method could slow down the solvent evaporation rate. The residual DMSO enhances the mass transport and diffusion which could favor uniform and high-quality film formation (Fig. 4e). A 15.7% power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 PSCs was achieved. The film growth atmosphere also determines the film morphology. Rao et al. developed solvent annealing treatment involving coordinated DMSO solvent to control the film crystallization dynamics and induce room-temperature formation of the CsPbX3 perovskite (Fig. 4c). The DMSO vapor molecules could condense on the perovskite film during the film growth process and launch the Ostwald ripening process. Highly uniform and void-free perovskite films were formed which originated from the perovskite boundary dissolution and rearrangement process. Yin et al. developed an approach for slowing the crystallization of the perovskite film by judiciously designing the Lewis base adducts PbI2(DMSO) and PbBr2(DMSO). The functional group SO guaranteed the successful coordination between DMSO and PbI2 or PbBr2. The DMSO adducts effectively prolonged the crystallization process by retarding the rapid reaction between PbI2, PbBr2 and CsI. The perovskite film derived from DMSO adducts exhibited large and dense grains which contributed to improved device photovoltaic performance and humidity stability. Besides, the Lewis base adducts constituted a low-activation energy route with a low annealing temperature of 120 °C to form the perovskite film.


With the solution-processing technique, the growth process and morphology of all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite films are greatly determined by precursor solvent components. The physical properties of solvent such as viscosity, surface tension, and density would strongly affect the homogeneous nucleation process. Likewise, the existence of solute–solvent crystalline intermediate phases has an impact on chemical reaction kinetics. A good control over the solvent properties is therefore necessary to reproducibly manufacture high-quality thin films. Intensive research efforts have led to the successful development of solvent composition regulation of the perovskite precursors to optimize the perovskite crystallinity and morphology. Zhang et al. conducted a systematic study of the influence of solvent composition on the CsPbI2Br crystallization process (Fig. 5c). They developed a solvent-engineering technology to optimize the perovskite quality by tuning the ratio of DMF:DMSO. Perovskite precursor solvent with pure DMF leads to the formation of small crystal grain size and cracks due to the fast volatilization of DMF and a high reaction rate. It was possible to optimize the film morphology by adding a small amount of DMSO. It was unveiled that the DMSO molecules could intercalate with adjacent PbX2via weak van der Waals-type interactions and form the intermediate PbX2–DMSO–CsI, which proved beneficial for deferring the growth rate and promoting the formation of large crystal grain size. However, excess DMSO led to decreased crystal grain size and increased pinholes, because DMSO with high hydrophobicity and low viscosity could affect the wettability of droplets and reduce the adhesion to the substrate. Liu et al. focused on fabricating an inorganic perovskite based on 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent. NMP displayed better solubility for inorganic perovskite precursors and weak coordination affinity for lead compounds compared with DMF and DMSO (Fig. 5a and b). In combination with the vacuum-assisted method, they could prepare inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite films at room temperature in air on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. Recently, the ionic liquid solvent has begun to be applied in the preparation procedure of the perovskite film. Distinct from the commonly used solvents such as DMSO, DMF, and NMP, the ionic liquid solvent not only dissolves the solute but also participates in the chemical reaction. Wang et al. fabricated high-quality all-inorganic CsPbI3−xBrx perovskites by involving the ionic liquid solvent methylammonium acetate (MAAc) (Fig. 5d). The MAAc component effectively retards the crystallization via the tailoring component interaction. They observed strong Pb–O interactions and the NH⋯I hydrogen bonds between MAAc and PbI2, which are responsible for the improved component interaction effect in MAAc solvent over DMF:DMSO solvent. Highly efficient and stable all-inorganic perovskite devices based on MAAc solvent with a PCE of 17.10% and a Voc over 1.30 V were obtained.


For perovskite film preparation, the perovskite precursor solvent evaporation could be accelerated by increasing the preparation temperature, which induces a profound impact on the crystal growth evolution process. Nam et al. systematically investigated the crystal growth behavior of the CsPbI2Br perovskite with the annealing temperature ranging from 100 to 350 °C. The perovskite crystal coalesced to form large grains within the Ostwald ripening process upon annealing above 230 °C. The films exhibited the best morphology with a pinhole-free surface and superior crystallization when annealed at 280 °C (Fig. 5f). Upon further increasing the temperature to 350 °C, the surface morphology was severely damaged. Besides, the film quality also determined the phase structure stability. The less (260 °C) and over-annealed (330 °C) films were chemically unstable against moisture. Gao et al. achieved a high-quality CsPbI2Br film with good coverage and uniformity using a flash annealing technique. The optimized flash annealing process for 10 s at 240 °C was developed to engender the desired CsPbI2Br black phase. Bai et al. proved that the elevated precursor solution temperature affected the nucleation step and the crystal growth rate during the crystallization process (Fig. 5e). The solubility of the perovskite precursor and solvent evaporation were correlated with the precursor solution temperature. They claimed that the restrained nuclei formation and increased crystallization rate were crucial for obtaining the film with a large grain size. Upon increasing the precursor solution temperature from 25 °C to 75 °C, the grains could gradually grow. The stabilized efficiency of 14.81% could be realized for CsPbI2Br PSCs via this temperature-assisted crystallization strategy.


Apart from optimizing the preparation technology, tremendous efforts have been devoted to modulate the crystallization kinetics and stabilize the perovskite phase via adding a small amount of functional organic additive materials. Some representative methods would be introduced in this section.

Wang et al. added a small amount of sulfobetaine zwitterions to facilitate the formation of a black-phase and improve phase stability. Besides, they discovered that the zwitterions impeded the fast crystallization process because an electrostatic interaction could be formed between the ions and CsPbI3 colloids in the precursor. The functional groups including an amine (N+) group and a sulfonate group (SO3−) in sulfobetaine zwitterions played an important role in the formation of the amorphous phase and maintained the grain size by impeding further grain growth. Jia et al. developed a new additive method for fabricating high-quality perovskites by adding the tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) additive into the CsPbI2.4Br0.6 precursor solution. The CsPbI2.4Br0.6 perovskite films with the TBAB additive exhibited higher crystallinity, larger grain size, and fewer defects. They ascribed the beneficial effects of additives to the functional groups on the TBAB molecule. The alkyl chain altered the crystallization process and the ionized halide atoms participated in the perovskite crystal growth process which enabled the formation of large grain size crystals and good surface coverage. Wang et al. successfully fabricated high-quality CsPbBr3 films with good crystallinity and low trap state density via adding a judicious amount of NH4SCN, which contains NH4+ and pseudohalide ion SCN−. They identified self-passivation at the grain boundaries and an optimized carrier transport behavior by surface potential mapping. The NH4SCN doped CsPbBr3 film displayed smaller dark regions indicating lower surface potential barriers. The PSCs based on a molar ratio of 1.5% achieved a champion efficiency of 8.47%, which is higher than that of the pure one (7.12%). You et al. adopted polymer poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a polymer additive to modify the CsPbIBr2 film. PSCs based on pure CsPbIBr2 suffered from low efficiency due to their low film coverage, high density of defects and unfavorable band energy level. PEG as a Lewis base molecule formed a strong interaction with the Lewis acid PbBr2 by C–O–C functional groups, which obviously slowed down the crystallization rate, yielding a pinhole-free perovskite film with reduced defect states. Besides, PEG as a moisture protection barrier physically covered the perovskite surface, contributing to the resistance of the film against heat and moisture. Gong et al. synthesized high quality and stable cubic phase CsPbI2Br films via hybridizing with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) (Fig. 6a). The BPQDs functioned as effective heterogeneous nucleation sites to facilitate the nucleation and growth of CsPbI2Br perovskite films, allowing an optimized film morphology, and induced phase transition to obtain a pure α-phase CsPbI2Br (Fig. 6b–g). The lone-pair electrons of BPQDs enabled strong electron donor–acceptor-like binding between CsPbI2Br and phosphorus atoms, leading to superior electron-extraction efficiency as well as stabilization of the inorganic perovskite framework. A PCE of 15.47% as well as excellent moisture stability could be achieved for BPQD embedded CsPbI2Br based PSCs. Tan et al. regulated the nucleation and crystallization of the CsPbI3 films by introducing the NH4I additive (an ammonium halide) into the precursor solution (Fig. 6k). With the interaction effect between the ammonium group and the Pb–I frameworks, large-size colloids comprised of Pb–I frameworks in the precursor solutions could be disassembled, thereby retarding the fast nucleation and promoting the perovskite crystal growth process. With these benefits, grain boundaries and interfacial contact of the CsPbI3 film could be optimized. Yu et al. synthesized a urea-ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt by mixing a certain ratio of NH4SCN and urea powders together and then heating, realizing the purpose of releasing free coordination-active SCN− groups and exploiting coordination activities (Fig. 6h–i). They confirmed that the coordination of SCN− to the Pb–I octahedra improves the CsPbI3 film morphology and suppresses defects and the non-radiative charge recombination of the film. A high efficiency of 20.08% with a high fill factor of 0.84 was obtained (Fig. 6j).

CsPbX3 has an intrinsically unstable phase stability, and the black perovskite phase (α-phase, β-phase, γ-phase) is prone to transform to the non-perovskite phase (δ-phase). The formation of the perovskite structure can be predicted from the empirical formula, where Goldschmidt tolerance factor t is given by eqn (7). RCs, RPb, and Rx are the ion radius of Cs, Pb, and halide ions, respectively.

t = (RCs + Rx)/(21/2 [RPb + Rx])
(7)
For CsPbX3, the undesirable phase transition occurs because the Cs+ cation is relatively too small to hold the framework of share-cornered lead-halide octahedra and t is outside the ideal range between 0.9 and 1, and therefore the perovskite structure is prone to distortion.
Apart from solvent engineering and additive engineering to optimize the film quality and stabilize the phase structure, there are other routes such as A-, B-, and X-site doping to stabilize the perovskite lattice structure and improve the unideal Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t). In addition, doping ions have a great impact on the crystal growth process and significantly alter the morphology of the perovskite film which is associated with the device performance.

At the early stages, CsPbI3-based inorganic PSCs exhibited non-working photovoltaic properties mainly because of unsatisfactory phase stability. In 2015, Eperon et al. pioneered the study for fabricating the working CsPbI3 based PSCs with 2.9% efficiency via incorporating the HI additive in the precursor to stabilize the black perovskite phase at room temperature (Fig. 7a). They proposed that HI minimized the grain size with high surface energy due to the faster crystallization process. Compared with the DMF solvent, HI could be driven off more rapidly and reduce the solubility of the Cs precursor. The film with HI also caused a strain in the lattice which is responsible for allowing the phase transition under lower temperatures. Subsequently, numerous works for stabilizing the perovskite phase by introducing the “HPbI3” additives have been reported, which play a pivotal role in supporting the formation of CsPbX3 with a black perovskite phase and lowering the annealing temperature. Recently, the “HPbI3” has been redressed to be DMAPbI3 (DMA = dimethylammonium), which is the product of DMF dissociation induced by HI. Meng et al. further investigated the chemical composition and phase evolution of the mixed DMAI−xCsxPbI3 layer during thermal treatment and demonstrated that DMA could be embedded into the crystal lattice and formed the intermediate state like DMA0.15Cs0.5PbI3 through a solid reaction between DMAPbI3 and Cs4PbI6. A further thermal annealing procedure could transform the film into γ-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3. Compared with γ-CsPbI3, the DMA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 phase exhibited a more symmetrical structure, a narrower bandgap, and superior phase stability. Wang et al. confirmed that DMAPbI3 could decrease the crystallization energy barrier and stabilize the perovskite black phase. They carefully scrutinized the role of DMAI in the CsPbI3 perovskite fabrication process and demonstrated that DMAI was an effective crystal growth additive to manipulate the crystallization process of the CsPbI3 film (Fig. 7c). Besides, DMAI can be completely removed by a suitable annealing process (Fig. 7b). Optimal DMAI doped CsPbI3 based PSCs exhibited an efficiency beyond 19% with high stability. Enlightened by the positive effects from the introduction of DMA in A-site, further methods involving the introduction of alternative amine cations like MA+ and GA+ have been adopted to stabilize the perovskite phase and regulate the film formation process. Lau et al. reported a cation exchange growth method for fabricating inorganic high-quality CsPbI3 by adding the methylammonium iodide (MAI) additive in the precursor. The multi-stage film formation processes were investigated. The intermediate MAPbI3 first formed at a low temperature (200 °C) and acted as a perovskite template for promoting the ion exchange. As the temperature ramped up, the MA+ ions in MAPbI3 were gradually replaced by Cs+ and formed γ-phase perovskite CsPbI3 with a uniform grain-size distribution after the high-temperature annealing process. Yoon et al. developed a method of sequential dripping of a methylammonium chloride (MACl) solution to control the intermediate stages of the crystallization process (Fig. 7d). The MACl solution accelerated the crystallization that enabled obtaining a highly uniform and pinhole-minimized thin film. The CsPbI3 based PSCs delivered an excellent PCE of 20.37% (Fig. 7e). Our group demonstrated that introducing GA+ cations effectively improved the structural stability and orientational order of CsPbI2Br. In situ GIWAXS measurements unveiled that the crystallization of the perovskite phase could be advanced with the assistance of GA+.

Aside from the organic ions, some inorganic alkali metal ions have also been explored to optimize the film quality via A-site doping engineering. Nam et al. optimized the photoexcited charge carrier transportation and phase stability by partial substitution of Cs+ by the smaller potassium cation (K+) to form the Cs0.925K0.075PbI2Br film. They demonstrated that the doped K+ cation led to the contraction of the PbX6 octahedral volume and improved the crystalline quality. Patil et al. revealed that the Rb+ cation incorporation provided a promising passivation effect and enabled a longer electron lifetime. The PSCs based on Cs0.99Rb0.01PbI2Br compositions produced a high PCE of 17.16% with an excellent FF of 80.03%. Meng et al. investigated the CsPbI2Br crystal formation behavior by adding excess CsI. The excess CsI engendered spontaneous co-crystallization of CsPbI2Br and dramatically improved the film quality with better coverage and fewer halide vacancies.

B-site doping has been widely studied to improve the crystal quality and phase stability by partially substituting Pb2+ ions with other metal ions. Xiang et al. incorporated Eu3+ as a substituent for Pb2+. Eu3+ was incorporated into the perovskite lattice at the atomic level and it stabilized the α-phase, providing exceptionally high thermodynamic stability. Lau et al. incorporated the less toxic strontium (Sr2+) ion to partially substitute Pb2+ in CsPb1−xSrxI2Br (Fig. 8a). The incorporation of Sr2+ was enriched on the surface and resulted in the appearance of “snowflakes”, providing a passivation effect and leading to a higher effective carrier lifetime. Sun et al. replaced PbI2 with ZnI2 to reduce the Pb content. Compared with Pb2+, Zn2+ exhibited stronger interactions with Br/I anions, accounting for the enlarged crystallites with an enhanced orientation by manipulating crystal growth. Besides, the traps in grain boundaries have also been passivated by the Cs–Zn–Br/I compound that benefits the charge transport (Fig. 8c and d). Wang et al. developed a strategy to retard the CsPbI2Br crystallization dynamics process by incorporating CuBr2, giving rise to enlarged grain size, improved carrier mobility and mitigated trap states of the perovskite film. Besides, the polycrystalline CsPbI2Br/CuBr2 film was grown with good orientation relative to the substrate plane, which was proven by the plots of azimuthally integrated scattering intensities as shown in Fig. 8b. The optimized device delivered a champion PCE of 16.15%. Yang et al. prepared the all-inorganic CsPb1−xGexI2Br perovskite at ambient temperature at high humidity. Ge2+ stabilized the cubic phase and reduced the trap densities. Moreover, the incorporation of Ge2+ achieved the highest Voc of up to 1.34 V for CsPb0.7Ge0.3I2Br perovskite solar cells. Liu et al. demonstrated that In3+ and Cl− co-doping could give rise to a structural reconstruction of the CsPbI3Br perovskite. The InCl3:CsPbI2Br material exhibited better phase stability, which was associated with the enhanced spatial symmetry and closely packed atom arrangement.


Another strategy for modulating perovskite composition is incorporating halide ions at the X site, which is capable of effectively optimizing the electronic and optical properties of perovskite materials. Sutton et al. investigated the iodide–bromide mixtures between CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3. The introduction of Br significantly improved the ambient stability, as compared with the neat triiodide perovskite, while the optical band gap was also increased (Fig. 8e–h). The CsPbI2Br based PSCs delivered stabilized power output with balanced phase stability and optical absorption properties. Wang obtained the chlorine doped CsPbI3 based PSCs with efficiency beyond 16% (Fig. 8i). They claimed that chlorine incorporation optimized the crystallization dynamics that was favorable for morphological and crystallite orientation and had beneficial effects on the conductivity and carrier mobility of the perovskite film. Fu et al. claimed that the introduction of fluorine at the X site could modulate the α-/δ-phase bulk heterojunction formation with an energy band offset that was beneficial for exciton dissociation and transport. The structural stability was also improved by increasing the tolerance factor due to the presence of the small F atom (Fig. 8j).


The all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has an unstable phase structure under ambient conditions. Reducing the perovskite dimension to zero-dimension and two-dimension is shown to be an effective approach to enhance the phase stability, because of the high micro-strain on the crystals and high surface energy. Owing to the hydrophobicity of the long-chain organic cations, the low-dimension perovskite also demonstrated strong moisture tolerance. Aside from the advantage of stability, dimension engineering also exhibits superiority in optimizing the growth process and driving the formation of highly oriented crystals. In the following these aspects including zero-dimension engineering and two-dimension engineering are summarized.


Reducing the film dimension via synthesizing the quantum dots (QDs) has been proved to be an effective method to impede the unwanted phase transition and suppress the film trap states due to the controllable surface properties and reduced surface strain caused by reducing the size of perovskites. The hydrophobic ligands attached to the surface protect the QDs from humidity and aggregation effects (Fig. 9a). Moreover, the layer-by-layer preparation process offers the possibility for precisely controlling the film thickness. The perovskite QDs exhibit near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) indicating fewer traps over their bulk film counterparts, which offers great promise to surpass the Shockley–Queisser limit and offers an alternative for application in PSCs (Fig. 9b). Protesescu et al. synthesized monodisperse colloidal nanocrystals of the CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskite, and found the nanocrystal-induced stabilization phenomenon, in that the nanocrystals with large size (100–200 nm) were prone to degrade into the δ-phase, while the nanocrystals with small size (4–15 nm) were more stable with the α-phase. The small size with hydrophobic ligand-induced high surface micro-strain could be responsible for stabilizing the crystal structure. It was notable that the perovskite QDs exhibited fascinating quantum size effects and their photoluminescence emission spectra could be tuned over the visible spectral region within 410–700 nm through compositional modulations. Swarnkar et al. demonstrated that the CsPbI3 QDs can be employed as an active absorber in PSCs. The synthetic CsPbI3 QDs could retain the cubic phase for months in ambient air and displayed a perfect perovskite lattice. The fabricated CsPbI3 QD based PSCs exhibited an efficiency of 10.77% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.23 V. The ligands capping on the QD surface enhance the hydrophobicity and protect the nanocrystals from segregation but also block the long-range electron transport to some content. Remarkable efforts such as replacing the long-chain oleic acid/oleylamine ligands with a short ligand or treatment by an antisolvent like methyl acetate were made to enhance electronic coupling. But these treatments in turn introduced surface defects, and thus accelerated nonradiative recombination. Sanhira further developed CsPbI3 QDs with tuned surface chemistry with A-site posttreatment using organic halide salts (e.g. FAX) (Fig. 9c). The posttreatment constituted an effective method to enhance the carrier mobility by tuning the coupling between CsPbI3 QDs, enabling increased photocurrent and yielding a high efficiency of 13.43%. Jia et al. introduced a “surface matrix curing” strategy to restore the surface matrix of inorganic CsPbI3 QDs and constructed high-performance solar cells with a PCE of 16.21%. Sufficient ions could be produced through a novel nucleophilic substitution reaction of tert-butyl iodide (TBI) and nucleophile trioctylphosphine (TOP), which effectively filled in the iodide vacancies and largely improved the optoelectronic properties and stability of the PQDs. Bian et al. developed a 3D/0D integrated graded bandgap structure comprising a CsPbI2Br bulk film and CsPbI3 QDs (Fig. 9d–f). The stability and carrier transport of QDs could be enhanced by the synergistic effect from Mn2+ substitution, SCN− ligand capping and FA+ surface modification. The QDs enabled the suitable band-edge bending that was beneficial for carrier collection. The optimized device delivered a PCE of 14.45%.


Long-chain organic cations could isolate the corner-sharing lead halide octahedral sheets and promote the conversion of the perovskite from a three-dimensional (3D) structure into a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure. A variety of small long-chain ammonium functionalities were introduced in all-inorganic PSCs and have been explored to optimize the film quality and stability. Zhang et al. introduced a small amount of the two-dimensional (2D) EDAPbI4 perovskite into CsPbI3 (Fig. 10a). The terminal NH3+ groups could cross-link with the perovskite crystal units, avoiding the unwanted phase conversion from δ-phase. Furthermore, they found that the moderate EDAPbI4 also contributed to reduce the pinholes and passivate the surface defects, which was in favor of suppressing carrier non-radiative recombination. CsPbI3· CsPbIiatio4 based PSCs delivered a PCE of 11.8%. Liao et al. employed dimension engineering to converting the 3D CsPbI3 into a 2D BA2CsPb2I7 structure. Compared with 3D CsPbI3, 2D BA2CsPb2I7 possessed superior structural stability under heat and humidity conditions (Fig. 10d). In addition, the 2D BA2CsPb2I7 exhibited prominent optoelectronic properties with favorable charge transportation, which mainly originated from the preferentially oriented growth direction and well-defined film morphology. Jiang et al. reduced the dimension of the α-CsPbX3 perovskite via introducing a judicious amount of phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The quasi-2D PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1 greatly inhibited the undesirable phase transition. The absorbance spectra of perovskite films with different values of n (n ≤ 5) exhibited multiple absorption peaks indicating the mixed grain comprising a variety of distinct values (Fig. 10b). The 2D perovskite also displayed a double-edged-sword effect. The energy band increased with increasing n values, which may weaken the light absorption (Fig. 11b). Yang designed a 2D–3D–2D composite perovskite heterostructure (Fig. 10c). Novel 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 nanosheets were employed to achieve double side (top and bottom surfaces) passivation and enhance the stability of the perovskite film by modifying the upper surface hydrophobicity properties. Zhang et al. constructed a dimensionally graded heterojunction comprising of bulk-nanosheet-quantum dots or a 3D–2D–0D dimension interface structure (Fig. 10e). The multiple graded structures established an electric field in the rear side of the device that allowed for better carrier extraction and increased current. In addition, the hydrophobic terminal groups on the graded nanostructure surface further improved the entire device stability in the ambient environment.


The crystal lattice defects and atomic periodicity perturbation at the surface generate a number of nonradiative recombination paths and are detrimental to device performance. It is unraveled that the defect induced nonradiative recombination is more prominent at the surface than in the inner bulk. In addition to the effect of the defect, the contact interface between the perovskite and the transport layer also dominates the film growth kinetics and the thin-film microstructure by affecting the heterogeneous nucleation. This section would describe the interface treatment engineering associated with chemical post-treatment and the employment of the interface optimization layer in PSCs, providing an insight into the relationship between the interfacial structure and device performance.


To suppress the detrimental effects of the perovskite surface defects, surface modification strategies have been carried out via the chemical post-treatment process. The under-coordinated ions at surface or grain boundaries could be passivated by molecular functional groups via coordinating bonds or ionic bonds. Besides, the wet chemical environment also plays an important role in tailoring the film formation process and indicates the secondary growth of the perovskite film. A surge of related progress will be introduced in the following part.

Wang et al. implemented the chemical post-treatment via employing phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTA) organic molecules (Fig. 11a). PTABr induced the Br/I ion exchange reaction on the perovskite surface, where the trend of Br count decreased while I count increased from the surface to the bottom which was confirmed by the cross-section element profiling measurement. PTABr post-treatment  could achieve synergistic effects including gradient Br doping and surface passivation. After such treatment, the crystal size could be increased with reduced pin-holes. The champion PTABr–CsPbI3 exhibited a high PCE of up to 17.06%. They further fabricated the βhe 6%.3 perovskite with choline iodide surface treatment and achieved efficiencies over 18% (Fig. 11c). The cracks and pinholes on the perovskite surface could be mitigated after chemical treatment which increased the charge-carrier lifetime and optimized energy level alignment between the perovskite absorber layer and the carrier transport layer. Wang et al. employed a sport layer. Wang e perovskite surface (6TIC-4F) to suppress non-radiative recombination of the CsPbBrxI3−x film (Fig. 11b). They implemented theoretical calculations and experiments to reveal that the nitrile (C–N) groups possessing the lone-pair electron directly could coordinate with the lead ion (Pb2+) through the formation of Lewis adducts and delocalize the valence electron density, thereby passivating the uncoordinated defects on surface/grain boundaries. The derived PSCs based on an inverted device structure achieved a champion efficiency of 16.1% with improved photostability. Zeng et al. promoted the extrinsic ionic grain boundary functionalization by adding Pb(Ac)2 in a CsPbI2Br precursor. It was unveiled that Ac− strongly coordinated with CsPbI2Br and reduced the formation energy, facilitating the fast nucleation. After high-temperature annealing, Pb(Ac)2 would decompose to semiconducting PbO and in situ form at the grain boundary, which effectively passivated the trap states and reduced the interface recombination. Wu et al. proposed a strategy of controlling the steric hindrance of surface organic terminal groups to prevent the lattice distortion and inhibit the phase transition of CsPbI3 (Fig. 11d). Three molecules with organic terminal groups with different substituted phenyl units and cyanoacetic acid were judiciously designed. They demonstrated that the applied large phenyl units constituted a strong steric-hindrance effect that could effectively hinder the octahedral tilting of corner-sharing [PbI6]4−. In addition, cyanoacetic acid as an anchor could bond with the Pb–I framework and passivate the surface Pb0, which enabled reducing the nonradiative recombination. Zhu et al. adopted a trace of MABr on the surface of CsPbI2Br prior to an annealing process. These MABr molecules served as nuclei seeds and could regulate the growth of CsPbI2Br grains, leading to the formation of CsPbI2Br film with full coverage, larger grains, higher crystallinity, and fewer electronic defects. Besides, MABr also provided additional Br− to form a thin Br− rich layer, which enabled the residual compressive strain along the horizontal direction in the film and thus markedly boosted its phase stability and humidity tolerance (Fig. 11e). Gu et al. reported a successful selective defect passivation strategy by using an environmentally friendly material histamine (HA) on top of the 3-dimensional (3D) CsPbI3−xBrx inorganic perovskite layer to prevent non-radiative recombination in the device. The imidazole ring in HA preferentially interacted with the iodine vacancy (VI) on the surface of the perovskite film through the Lewis acid–base reaction, while the ero2 group could interact with adjacent halides through the formation of a H-bond, strengthening the adsorption of the HA molecule on the surface of the perovskite. This synergistic effect significantly reduced the number of uncoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters, resulting in a significant reduction in the surface trap density of the perovskite film and prolonging the charge lifetime. In addition, HA passivation also caused upward movement of the energy band edge of the perovskite layer, which promoted hole transfer at the interface. By optimizing the concentration of HA, the inorganic PSC based on the CsPbI3−xBrx active layer achieved a champion PCE of 20.8%, which has been the highest reported PCE for all-inorganic PSCs up to now.

Li et al. carried out surface passivation engineering by capping the perovskite surface with poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) molecules (Fig. 12a). They proposed that the chemical bonding between the acylamino group in PVP and CsPbI3 enhanced the surface chemical states of electron cloud density and surface tension of the perovskite crystals, which were conductive to lower the surface energy, thus stabilizing the cubic CsPbI3 phase. With the assistance of PVP, the obtained CsPbI3 film exhibited an extra-long carrier diffusion length greater than 1.5 μm and excellent thermal/moisture stability. Ye et al. inserted an insulated shunt-blocking layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) between CsPbI3−xBrx and SnO2 (Fig. 12b). The LiF modification pushed forward the conduction band from 4.3 eV to 4.01 eV of the electron transport layer, leading to better energy level alignment with the perovskite, thus enhancing the built-in potential within the device and mitigating interfacial recombination. Besides, the interfacial effect was also attributed to the interface defect passivation, increasing the carrier lifetime of the perovskite. The fabricated device exhibited a high PCE of 18.64%. Tian et al. developed a synergic interface judicious design for enhancing the efficiency and stability of CsPbI2Br PSVCs. An amino-functionalized polymer (PN4N) and a dopant-free hole-transporting polymer poly[5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-al 5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene] (PDCBT) were employed as the cathode and anode interlayer respectively. The hydrophobic PN4N could tune the surface wetting property, thereby suppressing heterogeneous perovskite nucleation and promoting better growth of the perovskite film with larger grains and improved crystallinity. Besides, PN4N and PDCBT can both interact strongly with the perovskite crystal. Thus, the electronic surface trap states could be effectively passivated. The as-optimized CsPbI2Br PSCs achieved an encouraging PCE of 16.07%. Zhou et al. inserted 2D WS2 nanoflakes between the perovskite and the electron-transport layer to construct a van der Waals heterostructure (Fig. 12c). Perovskite tensile strain could be reduced owing to the weak interaction and lubricant property of WS2. Besides, WS2 with matched crystal lattice acted as a growth template to regulate the growth process, leading to a uniform perovskite with low defect density. An ultrahigh Voc up to 1.7 eV could be obtained.


In order to obtain a high-quality perovskite film, understanding the film formation mechanism is the most important prerequisite for the precise control of the crystallization dynamics during the film-forming process. Based on this concept, performing systematic in situ characterization of the film crystallization process is highly demanded. In this section, we highlight the powerful GIWAXS characterization technology for probing the film formation process which could help us to unveil the underlying crystallization kinetics of the CsPbX3 perovskite.


Synchrotron-based X-ray scattering is a powerful modern technique that offers guidance for an in-depth understanding of the all-inorganic perovskite materials. GIWAXS is a powerful characterization technique to detect the film microstructure information at a molecular-scale. As depicted in Fig. 13, the incident X-rays were incident on the sample surface at a grazing angle (close to the critical angle of the material). The scattered X-rays in different directions could be collected by a two-dimensional detector which is placed behind the sample. The collected Bragg diffraction in two-dimensional patterns reveals orientation information (in and out of plane with respect to the substrate) referring to the microstructure. Due to the small incidence angle of X-rays, the footprint of X-rays on the sample could be elongated which is beneficial for increasing the scattering intensity as well as the statistics.

The common wave vector geometry relationship is depicted in Fig. 14. The scattering wave vector can be defined as q = kf − ki. The wave vector ki referring to the incident beam is kept at a grazing angle α. The outgoing beam of the wave vector kf is collected at an out-of-plane angle β and in-plane angle Φ with respect to the sample surface and incident beam plane respectively.
The q in x, y, z direction components can be expressed by eqn (8)–(10), where k0 = 2π/λ is the modulus of the elastically conserved wave vector.
qx = k0[cos(ϕ)cos(β) − cos(α)]
(8)
qy = k0[sin(ϕ)cos(β)]
(9)
qz = k0[sinβsinα]

The synchrotron-based in situ GIWAXS characterization has been widely applied to monitor manifold perovskite formation procedures. Benefiting from the high flux and brilliant synchrotron radiation X-ray beam, the complete GIWAXS patterns of the samples could be measured within milliseconds, thus enabling in situ detection of the crystallization kinetics and real-time observation of the structural evolution process. Therefore, the time-resolved film formation mechanism could be elucidated by analyzing the detailed scattering signals from the crystallization process. Besides, the samples could be placed in an airtight chamber. The atmosphere (e.g., N2, O2, moisture) and temperature could be manipulated according to the research requirements, allowing the examination of the influence of the environmental factors on the film formation pathways.

Fan et al. performed in situ time-resolved GIWAXS characterization aiming to explore structural evolution and the film formation mechanism with the blade coating method (Fig. 14a). It was unveiled that the processing temperature was a critical factor that determined the film formation dynamics and led to distinct dynamical structure evolution. With the temperature increasing from 25 °C to 130 °C, the crystallization occurred much earlier and the sol–gel state was significantly altered and mediated by evaporation of the solvent. The three stages of the precursor crystallization process that rely heavily on the coordination between metal ions and I− or Br− ions are clearly unveiled. Stage I only exhibits the CsPbBr3 (100) diffraction at q = 10.8 nm−1, then the diffraction peak gradually shifts to lower q values with an increased crystallinity in stage II, and finally the diffraction peaks are fixed at the CsPbI2Br plane. The shift of the peaks confirmed that the noticeable halide composition is changing during the sequential crystallization process. With the assistance of in situ GIWAXS, Zhou et al. investigated the underlying impact of EA fumigation on the nucleation evolution of colloidal perovskite species at the low-temperature annealing stage. The crystal texture evolution process over the entire monitoring time could be obtained via analyzing the azimuthally integrated in situ GIWAXS patterns of the reference and fumigated film. It was revealed that EA triggered a retarding effect on perovskite ripening. They conjectured a ripening model wherein EA molecules with dual O-donor could interact with the metal Pb2+ cations and adhere to the nuclei so as to impose a higher barrier on perovskite nucleation and triggered the homogeneous nucleation. The tailored crystallographic features facilitated the formation of large grain size and oriented perovskite lattices. Our group provided the fundamental understanding of all-inorganic perovskite formation pathways and carried out an in-depth study of the role of the halide element (I, Br, Cl) in crystallization evolution and phase transition dynamics by utilizing the state-of-art in situ GIWAXS technique (Fig. 14b). We observed an obvious trend with the black phase advancing and the yellow phase deferring along with increasing Br content during the crystallization process, indicating that the Br ion facilitated the formation of the black α perovskite phase and suppressed the unwanted phase transition to the yellow δ phase (Fig. 14c). We attributed this to the critical role of Br ions in compensating the lattice distortion caused by the small Cs+ ions. Combined with the LaMer mechanism, the nucleation and crystal growth kinetics process can be identified to occur in three stages including (I) pre-nucleation stage; (II) nucleation stage; and (III) growth stage. The Br ions could lower the nucleation barrier so as to enter stage II earlier, giving rise to the formation of sufficient nucleation sites. The morphology of the resultant film could be significantly altered due to the expedited crystallization kinetics. Moreover, with the assistance of Cl− ion doping, crystallinity and orientation order within the bulk film could be improved, which contributed to inhibit nonradiative recombination. We further systematically studied the mechanism of the light soaking (LS) effect in all-inorganic CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 by in situ GIWAXS and clarified the origin of lattice expansion under light irradiation for the first time (Fig. 14d). We found that in all-inorganic PSCs, the LS effect is mainly caused due to photo-activated halide migration leading to defect passivation. Therefore, fewer halide vacancies, larger crystal grains and higher crystallinity all helped to shorten the curing time of the device under LS. To confirm this hypothesis, we studied the LS behavior of CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 PSCs with different Br/I ratios (x = 0, 0.2, and 0.33). As the ratio of Br/I increased, the curing time of the device was significantly shortened, which was consistent with the higher mobility of Br compared to I and the lower activation energy. By fine-tuning the content of excessive PbI2 in the precursor, we successfully suppressed the LS effect of PSCs based on CsPb(I0.8Br0.2)3 and obtained a PCE of 18.14%. Steele et al. resolved the structural state evolution of CsPbI3 with the thermal quenching treatment based on the in situ GIWAXS technique. Meanwhile, the crystal distortions and strain-driven texture formation within black CsPbI3 thin films could be tracked. They found that clamping and interfacial strain in combination acted as key driving forces that affect the structural texture and thermal phase relations. Based on the GIWAXS measurement analysis, they developed a method to render stable, black phase CsPbI3 perovskite films by the use of substrate clamping and biaxial strain at room temperature.


In summary, all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 has made significant progress and ignited increasing interest from the field of energy materials science and photovoltaics. A summary of the reported crystal growth modulation and defects suppression strategies of CsPbX3 PSCs is shown in Table 1. So far, the all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite exhibits over 20% efficiency (Fig. 15), but still lags far behind the MA or FA based organic and inorganic hybrid PSCs. To further enhance the device performance and speed up the commercial feasibility, the following aspects should be taken into account.

First of all, an in-depth understanding of the intrinsic film formation mechanism is primary to precisely regulate the kinetics of perovskite crystallization and improve the perovskite quality with fewer defects. Different from the traditional organic–inorganic perovskite material, the all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite shows a different crystallization behavior owing to the different material properties. Therefore, more investigations should be carried out to unveil the underlying all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite film formation mechanism. From this point of view, much more studies and techniques regarding the systematic in situ characterization are expected.
Secondly, much more efforts are still imperative to deeply understand the underlying physics mechanism of the phase structure transition between the perovskite phase (α-, β-, γ-phase) and the non-perovskite phase (δ-phase). The phase stability drawbacks impede the outdoor durability of the devices and need to be effectively unraveled. Most of the previous studies are merely based on experimental investigations, while the intrinsic phase structure transition mechanism still needs deep understanding at a theoretical level, which could guide us to understand the intrinsic properties of all-inorganic perovskite materials. Although the appropriate encapsulation could postpone the material degradation to some extent, new effective technologies for improving the device stability and preventing the unwanted intrinsic phase transition are still imperative to develop in the future.
Thirdly, the most efficient all-inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs are made in small areas within 0.1 cm2 in the laboratory. For the commercialization requirement of all-inorganic PSCs, upscaling the photovoltaic device and developing large-area module manufacturing technology is inevitable. Currently, Chang et al. printed CsPbI3 solar cells based on blade-coating at a low temperature. High quality CsPbI3 films were obtained via a combination of air-flow-assisted drying and the functional additive Zn(C6F5)2. A high efficiency of over 19% for printable PSCs could be obtained. This work proved the feasibility for ambient scalable manufacturing of all-inorganic PSCs. Nevertheless, there still remain significant challenges for optimizing the film quality and uniformity and unraveling the energy loss mechanism upon scaling up the device scale. Several aspects with respect to controlling the rheological properties of a liquid film before drying and crystallization kinetics should be taken into consideration. New scalable deposition methods for CsPbX3 perovskite growth including, but not limited to, blade coating, slot-die coating, inkjet printing, and spray coating should be explored for further module construction.
Fourthly, it is meaningful to expand the practical application field of all-inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs. The CsPbX3 perovskite is an ideal alternative that could be applied as a top cell when constructing tandem solar cells due to its large tunable optical band gap (1.7–2.3 eV). The theoretical calculation has shown that the PCE of two-junction and three-junction solar cells is ∼46% and ∼50% under 1 sun irradiance, respectively, which is much higher than the limit PCE of a single junction CsPbX3 PSC. CsPbX3 perovskite/organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, CsPbX3/Si, and CsPbX3/CIGS tandem solar cells show great promise in the future. To achieve high PCE in two-junction tandem PSCs, the internal recombination layers (RL) need to be carefully designed, which play a critical role in providing a low electrical resistance and optically low-loss connection between subcells. The ideal RL need to be transparent to the wavelengths absorbed in the subcell and low resistive to the carriers. In addition, the Jsc match should be taken into consideration. Achieving the maximum Jsc (e.g., >20 mA cm−2) independently in both subcells would be a future challenge. Besides the tandem PSCs, the semitransparent all-inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs also need to be referred. This kind of PSC can be applied in windows or roofs of buildings, which is promising for making the buildings more energy-efficient and more environmentally friendly. The competitiveness between the PCE and device transmittance should be taken into account. For a device with high transmittance, it is difficult to engender a high Jsc due to reduced film thickness. In addition, photomanagement strategies in terms of reducing the light reflection and increasing the light absorption need to be further explored to offer paths for reducing energy loss. Currently, Wang et al. fabricated semitransparent perovskite solar cells based on CsPbI2Br film through intermediate-adduct-assisted growth and electrode optimization. The PCE could reach 14.01% and 10.36% under an average visible transmittance of 31.7% and 40.9%. This work exhibited the great application potential of all-inorganic PSCs in high-efficiency semitransparent solar cells. With the gradual maturity of preparation technology, more advanced works are desired in the future.
Overall, although massive progress has been made, a huge discrepancy between the experimentally obtained PCE and the S–Q limit still needs to be mitigated. Improving the CsPbX3 perovskite film quality via crystal growth modulation engineering along with defect suppression strategy not only benefits the device photovoltaic performance, but also their long-term stability. Reducing the Voc loss is expected by suppressing the nonradiative recombination, which could result in higher PCE. Exploring the underlying film crystallization mechanism that gives rise to guidance for the crystal growth modulation engineering techniques should be paid more attention. The phase transition mechanism should be given serious attention which is the crucial factor that impedes practical employment. The commercial exploration for large-scale techniques should be advanced. In the meantime, the tandem device and semi-transparent PSCs still need further exploration which will broaden the commercial application scope of all-inorganic PSCs. With the substantial efforts towards developing all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite materials, it is believed that a bunch of encouraging breakthroughs could be obtained in the near future.
