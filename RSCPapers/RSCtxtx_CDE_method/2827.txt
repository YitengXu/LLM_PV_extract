Ideal morphological features are of particular importance to produce high performance all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), in which active blends generally involve unfavorable phase separation due to complicated intermixing. Developing a suitable processing solvent and additive is an effective and versatile approach to manipulate the morphology of the blends. This study demonstrates the synergistic effects of the processing solvent and additive on the photovoltaic performances of all-PSCs composed of a conjugated copolymer J71 donor and a typical N2200 acceptor. A low boiling point chloroform (CF) solvent combined with 1% 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) additive was identified as the optimal processing condition to treat the J71:N2200 blends. Consequently, the all-PSCs prepared from CF + 1% DIO processing achieved an outstanding efficiency of 9.34% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 77.86%, which is among the top values for the current all-PSC systems. Owing to the low JSC, just a moderate efficiency of 7.28% was achieved for the device prepared from chlorobenzene (CB) + 1% DIO processing despite its high FF. The electron microscopy tests revealed that the CF solvent was superior to the CB solvent to obtain uniform morphologies and the addition of the DIO additive could further lead to more favorable phase separation and domain size. Moreover, the results of charge generation, transport, and recombination analysis correlate well with the remarkable photovoltaic properties. Our results highlight the critical significance of selecting the appropriate processing solvent and additive to produce high performance all-PSCs.

Over the past few decades, solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention owing to their unique merits such as low cost, light weight, rapid energy payback, and roll-to-roll compatible device manufacturing. The collaborative efforts of material synthesis, device engineering, and theoretical studies have driven the remarkable developments in device efficiency and stability of PSCs, for which the photoactive blends usually comprise either fullerene acceptors or non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (SMAs). Meanwhile, tremendous progress has also been achieved for the all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) that incorporate conjugated polymers both as an electron donor and as an acceptor in the photoactive layer. Typically, compared to their photovoltaic counterparts, all-PSCs may provide superior thermal and mechanical endurance, presenting promising application in flexible and portable optoelectronic devices in the future.

To promote the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, most research efforts have been dedicated to designing and synthesizing novel conjugated polymeric donor/acceptor materials. Taking some successfully developed polymer donors as examples, the fluorine substituted benzodithiophene-alt-benzotriazole copolymer (J51) has been reported in efficient all-PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.27%. The widely used two-dimensional (2D)-conjugated polymer PBDB-T, which was efficient for SMA-based PSCs, was introduced in all-PSC systems as well, and high PCEs of above 8.5% have been realized by several independent groups. Huang et al. developed a wide bandgap donor PTzBI-Si with a siloxane-terminated side chain, and obtained record device efficiency via green-solvent-processed fabrication. Most recently, our group found that the copolymer J71 incorporating trialkylsilyl side chains is superior to J61 with linear alkylthio substituents in all-PSC systems. As for polymer acceptors, numerous n-type materials have been developed based on building blocks such as perylene diimide (PDI), naphthalene diimide (NDI), B ← N bridged bipyridine units, and bithiophene imide (BTI). To date, all-PSCs have shown the highest PCE of up to 11%, an exceptionally high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of > 1.2 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of > 16 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of > 75%. However, their photovoltaic performances still lag behind those of fullerene-based and non-fullerene SMA-based counterparts. Generally, the unsatisfactory PCEs of all-PSCs are related to the difficulty in controlling the morphology of the photoactive blends, mainly due to the reduced entropic contribution and complicated macromolecular chain entanglements, thus leading to poor phase separation and unfavorable charge carrier generation/transport.
Indeed, controlling the bulk-heterojunction morphology of blend films is a critical prerequisite to realize desirable device performances for all-PSC systems. An extremely effective strategy for obtaining ideal morphologies is to select a suitable processing solvent and additive. Halogenated solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB), o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and chloroform (CF), which typically exhibit great solubility in most photoactive blends, are widely utilized in common research. It is well acknowledged that the boiling point and volatility of processing solvents play an important role in the film formation of active blends during the spin-coating procedure. Besides, the use of additive is beneficial for the improvement of the device performance in diverse all-PSC systems by tuning the morphological length scales and domain purity since the additive allow long polymer chains to aggregate easily. Nevertheless, a large amount of the additive could result in severe phase separation and poor photovoltaic properties in all-PSCs. Interestingly, several research groups have also reported efficient all-PSCs with PCEs over 7% without any additive processing. To some extent, the fundamental operating mechanism and regulation of the morphology of all-polymer blends with the processing solvent and additive should be further elucidated. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for in-depth investigation on the roles of the solvent and additive to produce high photovoltaic parameters for all-PSCs.
Herein, we utilize the common solvents CB and CF as the processing solvent in combination with 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) as a solvent additive to treat the active blends, in which a medium bandgap copolymer donor J71 pairs with the established electron-withdrawing polymer acceptor N2200 (poly[[N,N-9-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,50-(2,20-bithiophene)]). Although CB and CF are both chlorinated solvents, they differ significantly in their boiling points (CB: 132 °C and CF: 61 °C) and volatility, which could lead to differences in their film formation kinetics and microstructures. The effects of different combinations of the processing solvents and additive on film morphologies and device performances were comprehensively explored. Morphological characteristics revealed that the low boiling point CF along with 1% DIO was the best option to treat the J71:N2200 blends, and favorable uniform morphologies with appropriate phase separation could be obtained. As a result, the J71:N2200 all-PSCs showed an outstanding PCE of 9.34% with an FF of 77.86%. This ultrahigh FF is one of the best values among the currently reported all-PSC systems. In addition, the results of charge generation, transport, and recombination analysis correlate well with the remarkable photovoltaic properties.

The medium bandgap 2D-conjugated copolymer J71 is based on a benzodithiophene-alt-benzotriazole unit with a trialkylsilyl substituent on the side chains, and has been described as a successful donor candidate both in the non-fullerene SMA-based and all-polymer-based solar cells. Considering the high electron affinities and electron mobilities as well as suitable energy levels, the commercial n-type semiconductor N2200 (i.e. P(NDI2OD-T2)) was employed as an acceptor, possessing a high number-average molecular weight of 75.6 kg mol−1, which is greatly beneficial for achieving the desired blend film morphology, electrical properties and photovoltaic performance. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the pristine J71 film and the N2200 film are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI. It can be seen that the pure J71 film exhibits two absorption peaks at 541 and 585 nm, located in the range of 380–635 nm. This absorption profile complements the absorption profile of the N2200 film, which shows two distinct absorption bands located at 300–445 nm and 500–840 nm. Therefore, the J71:N2200 blends appear to be promising photoactive materials to fabricate all-PSCs.


Fig. 1a shows a schematic diagram of the J71:N2200 all-PSCs, which adopts a regular configuration consisting of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/J71:N2200/aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO)/Al. The robust AZO layer was used as an electron transport layer according to our previous work. CB and CF were individually used as a host solvent to dissolve the J71:N2200 (w/w, 2:1) blends, and then different amounts of DIO were added into them with various volume ratios (w/o, 0.5%, 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively) before depositon. The thickness of photoactive layers spin-coated from all of the solvent/additive systems was around 100–120 nm by controlling the blend concentration and spinning conditions, which reduces the variation in the contribution of light absorption of the active layers. All the chemical structures of J71, N2200, and processing solvents and additive used in this study are shown in Fig. 1b.
We systematically investigated the impacts of the CB or CF solvent along with different DIO contents (w/o, 0.5%, 1%, 3% and 5%) on the photovoltaic performances of the J71:N2200 all-PSCs. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices under AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. S2, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table S1. With the appropriate amount of DIO (0.5%–1%), both the J71:N2200 all-PSCs prepared from CB and CF host solvents showed improved PCEs compared to those without any additive. When the amount of DIO was excessive (∼5%), the device efficiency rapidly decreased owing to the decreased JSCs, FFs and VOCs. Under identical conditions, all the CF-based devices showed better performances than the CB-based devices mainly attributing to the higher JSCs. Simultaneously, it can be found that the J71:N2200 devices could achieve a relatively high FF of > 70% more easily compared with the previously reported all-PSC systems. The best performance devices could be obtained by adding a DIO content of 1% for both CB- and CF-based all-PSCs.
In order to clearly explore the synergistic effects of CB and CF solvents along with/without a DIO additive, four kinds of solvent/additive systems (CB, CB + 1% DIO, CF, CF + 1% DIO) were investigated in depth in the following sections. Fig. 2a shows the optimal J–V curves of the J71:N2200 all-PSCs processed with various treatments (CB, CB + 1% DIO, CF, and CF + 1% DIO). Without adding any DIO, modest PCEs of 5.50% and 7.48% were realized for the devices prepared from the pure CB and CF solvents, respectively. After adding 1% DIO additive, an outstanding PCE of 9.34% (VOC = 0.909 V, JSC = 13.19 mA cm−2, and FF = 77.86%) was obtained when the J71:N2200 active layer was deposited from CF + 1% DIO. To the best of our knowledge, this high FF value is one of the best results to date among the reported all-PSC systems. The device prepared from CB + 1% DIO processing could also achieve a high FF of up to 76.75% and only a low JSC of 10.45 mA cm−2, resulting in a moderate PCE of 7.28%. The corresponding dark J–V characteristics (Fig. S3) show better diode properties with a lower leakage current for those devices with 1% DIO, and are also consistent with the obtained RS and RSh. All the critical photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1, and the PCEs from 20 independent devices are plotted in a box chart (Fig. S4) for a direct comparison. Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the four J71:N2200 all-PSCs. The EQE results are consistent with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. Obviously, the J71:N2200 devices using CF as a host solvent exhibit a higher photo conversion efficiency than the devices prepared from CB. In particular, the device prepared from CF + 1% DIO treatment exhibits a strong response from 350 to 750 nm, resulting in a higher JSC value than those of other devices. Overall, the CF solvent is superior to CB for the J71:N2200 all-PSC systems mainly in achieving higher JSCs, although the device prepared from the CB solvent can also achieve a high FF. On the other hand, the addition of the DIO additive into both CB and CF can significantly enhance the device JSC and FF. These results indicate that synergistically optimizing the processing solvent and additive is an effective approach to boost the all-PSC performance. Moreover, we also investigated the effect of active layer thickness (ranging from 74 to 346 nm) on the photovoltaic performance of the J71:N2200 all-PSCs prepared from CF + 1% DIO processing. The corresponding J–V curves and device parameters are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2. The all-PSCs with a small film thickness of 74 nm could achieve a moderate PCE of 8.42%, mainly due to the relatively low JSC caused by insufficient light harvesting. When the film thickness was increased to 158 nm, an increased JSC value (13.38 mA cm−2) could be obtained. However, a significant decrease in JSC and FF for the all-PSCs was observed simultaneously with large film thicknesses (278 and 346 nm), resulting in greatly decreased photovoltaic efficiencies, which may be ascribed to the increased transport resistances and charge recombination caused by the very thick active layer.

Considering the vital correlation between the photovoltaic properties and the morphology of the blend films, we comprehensively examined the morphological characteristics of the J71:N2200 blend films prepared from different solvent/additive treatments (CB, CB + 1% DIO, CF, and CF + 1% DIO) by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Firstly, the AFM measurement in the tapping mode was performed to characterize the evolution in surface topography. As shown in the height images of Fig. 3 (2 μm × 2 μm), the film spin-coated from the pure CB solvent shows a distinct and coarse morphology with a root-mean square (RMS) roughness of 2.36 nm. These features were caused by strong aggregation during the film deposition process. Upon adding 1% DIO additive, a slightly uniform J71:N2200 film (CB + 1% DIO) was formed with a decreased RMS roughness of 1.19 nm. In contrast, homogeneous and smooth surfaces with a small RMS roughness <0.8 nm were observed for the CF-based blend films when the DIO content was ≤1% (Fig. 3c and d). In particular, for the film prepared from CF + 1% DIO processing, the nanoscale network and reduced phase separation became more apparent, suggesting that the two polymer matrices created fine domains and better-connected pathways. It is noted that relatively serious phase separation would occur with an increase in the DIO content to above 3% (Fig. S6 and S7), which is unfavorable to the device performance. Obviously, the processing solvents and additive have a significant impact on the morphology and phase separation of the J71:N2200 blends.
These phase separation features of the J71:N2200 blend films prepared from different solvent/additive treatments were further investigated by TEM characterization (Fig. 4). It is clear that the blend films prepared from CB processing exhibit serious phase separation with stripe aggregates and large domains across the entire film. The addition of 1% DIO could slightly reduce the nanophase separation and decrease the domain size, ameliorating charge generation and transport. In comparison, the blend films processed from CF show distinct interpenetrating networks with smaller domain sizes in the film, which is favorable for efficient exciton dissociation, thus giving rise to higher JSC and FF values in devices. Our results are in good accordance with the previous work, in which Kim et al. indicated that the domain sizes of all-polymer blends were strongly correlated with the JSCs of devices. These drastic morphological variations resulted from different solvent volatilities and material solubilities. The highly volatile CF solvent would quickly freeze the morphology of the blends at an early stage of phase separation before considerable demixing of the polymer donor and polymer acceptor happens. Conversely, the less volatile CB solvent plasticizes the film for a longer duration during spin-coating and allows for phase separation into large aggregates. Meanwhile, the DIO additive having different solubilities for the two polymers may modify the aggregation kinetics during the film formation process. Therefore, the synergistic effects of the processing solvent and additive promote the generation of favorable blend film morphology.
To gain insight into the charge carrier generation and dissociation behavior of J71:N2200 all-PSCs under different processing solvent/additive conditions, the relationships between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the effective voltage (Veff) of devices were examined. Jph and Veff are defined by the equations Jph = JL − JD and Veff = V0 − Va, where JL and JD are the current densities measured in the presence and absence of light, respectively, V0 is the voltage when JL = JD, and Va is the applied bias. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Jph values of the devices with 1% DIO increase more rapidly and almost saturate at a relatively lower Veff than those without the additive, indicating more efficient exciton dissociation and carrier collection. Generally, it is believed that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes to produce a saturated current (Jsat) when Veff is high enough. And the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) is linearly correlated to Jsat, which can be evaluated from Jsat = qGmaxL, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The devices prepared from CB + 1% DIO treatment show an improved Gmax value of 6.37 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 112.3 A m−2) compared to that of the devices processed from the pure CB solvent with a Gmax value of 5.58 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (Jsat = 98.2 A m−2). The devices prepared from CF and CF + 1% DIO treatments exhibit higher Gmax values of 7.28 × 1027 and 7.89 × 1027 m−3 s−1, respectively, compared to the CB-based devices. These results show that the CF solvent combined with 1% DIO additive is the most efficient solvent in enhancing exciton generation and dissociation, partially contributing to the best photovoltaic performance (JSC and FF).
The charge transport properties of the J71:N2200 devices prepared from different solvent/additive treatments were determined for hole-only devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive blends/MoO3/Al and electron-only devices of ITO/AZO/photoactive blends/Ca/Al by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method according to the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. S8). The apparent hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities are calculated to be 0.86 × 10−4/0.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices prepared from the pure CB solvent and 1.40 × 10−4/1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices prepared from CB + 1% DIO treatment. For the devices prepared from CF as the host solvent, the μh/μe values are estimated to be 1.59 × 10−4/0.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the J71:N2200 devices. After adding 1% DIO into CF, the devices exhibited remarkable mobilities of 2.03 × 10−4/1.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The detailed μh and μe values are shown in Fig. 5b and are listed in Table S3. Apparently, the devices prepared from CF + 1% DIO treatment show relatively higher mobilities with an extremely balanced μh/μe value of 1.09, which is beneficial for facilitating charge transport and suppressing charge recombination, thus helping to realize an excellent FF of 77.86% and a PCE of 9.34%. It is worth noting that the devices spin-coated from CB + 1% DIO also possessed a well-balanced μh/μe value of 1.19, which plays a key role in realizing a high FF. The above results indicate that adding a DIO additive into the host solvent is a facile and effective approach to promote the FF of all-PSCs.
The JSC and VOC dependence on illumination light (Plight) with varied intensities (from 6 to 100 mW cm−2) was measured to probe the underlying charge recombination mechanism in the J71:N2200 solar cells. In principle, JSC follows a power-law dependence on Plight (JSC ∝ (Plight)α), where the exponential factor (α) represents the degree of bimolecular recombination. If all free charges could be swept out and collected at the electrodes effectively prior to recombination, the α value should be close to 1. As shown in Fig. 5c, the devices prepared from pure CB processing yielded a relatively low fitted α value of 0.939, implying that undesirable bimolecular recombination has occurred in the all-PSCs, and an increased α value of 0.981 was obtained for devices prepared from CB + 1% DIO. For the all-PSCs using CF as a host solvent, the devices prepared from CF + 1% DIO processing showed a higher α value of 0.992 compared to 0.963 for the pure CF-based devices, indicating that the bimolecular recombination behavior was efficiently suppressed due to the addition of 1% DIO additive, resulting in the highest JSC and FF. We also plotted VOCversus the logarithm of Plight as per the equation: VOC ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), where k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, the absolute temperature, and the elementary charge, respectively.Fig. 5d shows that the J71:N2200 all-PSCs prepared from CB + 1% processing exhibit a slope of 1.44kT/q, while a slightly decreased slope of 1.32kT/q was obtained for the devices spin-coated from pure CB, suggesting that the addition of the DIO additive could lessen the interfacial traps. Comparatively, the J71:N2200 all-PSCs under CF + 1% conditions showed the lowest slope of 1.22kT/q and implied the weakest dependence of VOC on the light intensity. These results are completely related to the favorable morphology where the J71:N2200 blends prepared from CF + 1% processing can offer better structural morphology and phase separated network, thus balancing the charge transport and suppressing the charge recombination, eventually contributing to excellent device FF and efficiency.

In summary, the synergistic effects of the processing solvent (CB or CF) and the DIO additive on the device performances of J71:N2200 all-PSCs were comprehensively investigated. It was found that the CF solvent combined with 1% DIO additive was the optimal processing condition to treat the J71:N2200 blends. An impressive PCE of 9.34% with a high FF of 77.86% was achieved for the all-PSCs when the blend layer was deposited from CF + 1% DIO. Although the devices prepared from CB + 1% DIO processing could also achieve a high FF of 76.75% but only achieved a low JSC of 10.45 mA cm−2, it resulted in a moderate PCE of 7.28%. The related measurements demonstrated that CF was superior to CB as a host solvent to obtain uniform morphologies, and the addition of the DIO additive could further lead to more favorable phase separation and domain size. Our results highlight the particular importance of finely selecting the processing solvent and additive to boost the performance of all-PSCs.
