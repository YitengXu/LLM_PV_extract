We have designed and synthesized a new thiocyanate-free sensitizer coded as SPS-01 and used it as the sensitizer in a TiO2 based nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). SPS-01 exhibits strong visible absorption properties with maximum peak around at 532 nm. The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a DSSC sensitized with SPS-01 (7.96%) is higher than that of N719 (7.30%) under identical experimental conditions. This high PCE is attributed mainly due to the improvement in the short circuit current.

The development of cost effective renewable energy alternatives to current power generation methods is an urgent need because of the increasing demands and concerns over global warming. Among several new energy technologies, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) pioneered by O'Regan and Grätzel, have attracted significant attention because of their low cost and high performance. A DSSC is a photo-electrochemical device which contains a photoelectrode, iodine–iodide redox coupled electrolyte and counter electrode. The photoelectrode consists of a tailor made light absorbing sensitizer attached to the surface of a large band gap nanocrystalline TiO2 film to absorb the light. In light harvesting, the choice of a sensitizer should be capable of efficient absorption in the visible to NIR light region of the solar spectrum and is a crucial factor. Therefore, many efforts have been focused on the design and synthesis of various dyes, including metal complexes and organic dyes. Among them Ru(II) polypyridine complexes have been extensively pursued as a potential candidate for efficient sensitizers because of their favorable photophysical properties such as intense charge transfer absorption in the visible region and electrochemical properties which can be systematically fine tuned to achieve optimal characteristics. With the certified PCEs more than 11% for DSSCs based on stable Ru(II) dyes as the light harvesting component, this remains the frontier of chemical discovery.

However, thiocyanate ligands are incorporated in most of the Ru(II) based sensitizers, which reduce the synthetic yield and also deteriorate the lifespan of the as-fabricated cell units due to the weak Ru–NCS dative bonding under excessive thermal stress or light soaking. Few attempts have been made to replace the SCN donor ligands, however they gave only limited success, a superior conversion efficiency of 10.1% is now documented by the Grätzel group. It is know when extended π-conjugation is incorporated between the chromophore and the anchoring group, ruthenium sensitizers are afforded with increased molar extinction coefficients and enhanced red response in the visible regions.
Recently, Chou et al. reported a PCE of 9.54% for DSSCs based on a thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizer containing both 4,4′-carboxy-2,2′-bipyridine and 2-pyrazolate ancillaries. As part of our research program in the development of thiocyanate-free sensitizers, here we report the synthesis of a thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizer, incorporating a phenylethenyl moiety into the anchoring bipyridine, represented as SPS-01(Scheme 1) and used it as a potential sensitizer for DSSCs. The DSSC based on the SPS-01 sensitizer with 20 μm thick transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 layer produced an overall PCE of 7.96% which is higher than the DSSC based on an N719 sensitizer (7.30%), under identical conditions.

2-(3-(Trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridine (149.76 mg, 0.70 mmol) and [Ru(4,4′-bis(p-methylcarboxystyryl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(p-cymene)Cl]·Cl (250 mg, 0.33 mmol) were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (30 mL), and the reaction mixture was heated to 130 °C under stirring for 12 h. After evaporating the solvent, the aqueous phase was separated and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 25 mL). The crude compound was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2–EtOAc = 5:1). Finally, the resulting solid was dissolved in a mixture of acetone (5 mL) and 1 M sodium hydroxide (5 mL). The solution was heated to 100 °C under N2 for 24 h. After completing the hydrolysis, the solvent was removed and the solid was dissolved in basic H2O solution (10 mL) and was titrated with 2 M HCl to pH 3 to afford a brown precipitate. This brown product was then taken into a minimum amount of methanol and purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as the eluent. The main band was collected and solvent was evaporated to dryness. After then, the brown precipitate was washed with deionized water and diethyl ether in sequence, giving SPS-01 as a powdery material. The procedure of the synthesis of SPS-01 is shown in Scheme 2. 1H NMR (CD3OD, 600 MHz): δ 8.1 (s, 2H), 8.0 (m, 3H), 7.94 (t, 2H), 7.86 (d, 2H), 7.57–7.78 (m, 12H), 7.35 (3H, d), 7.2 (d, 2H), 7.07–6.93 (m, 2H); FR-IR (KBr, cm−1): 3418, 1587, 1540, 1383, 1249, 1137, 991; ESI-MS (M−): 972 (expected 973).

Electrochemical data were recorded using Autolab potentiostat/Galvanostat PGSTAT30 having three electrodes. The cyclic voltammogram curves were obtained from a three electrode cell in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, using a dye coated on glassy carbon as a working electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and calibrated with ferrocene. All the measured potentials were converted to the NHE scale. The optical spectra of SPS-01 in solution and adsorbed onto TiO2 surface were recorded with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimarzu).

Nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrodes of about 20 μm thickness (area: 0.25 cm2) were prepared using a variation of a method reported by Grätzel and co-workers. Fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated (FTO) glass electrodes (Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) with a sheet resistance of 8–10 ohm m−2 and an optical transmission of >80% in the visible range were used. Anatase TiO2 colloids (particle size ∼13 nm) were obtained from commercial sources (Ti-Nanoxide D/SP, Solaronix). The nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films of approximately 20 μm thickness were deposited onto the conducting glass by screen-printing. The film was then sintered at 500 °C for 1 h. The film thickness was measured with a Surfcom 1400A surface profiler (Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd). The electrodes were impregnated with a 50 mM titanium tetrachloride solution and sintered at 500 °C. The dye solutions (2 × 10−4 M) were prepared in 1:1 acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol solvents. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) as a co-adsorbent was added to the dye solution at a concentration of 20 mM. The electrodes were immersed in the dye solutions and then kept at 25 °C for 20 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface.


Photovoltaic measurements were performed in a two-electrode sandwich cell configuration. The dye-deposited TiO2 film was used as the working electrode and a platinum-coated conducting glass as the counter electrode. The two electrodes were separated by a surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed up by heating the polymer frame. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, and 0.1 M LiI and TBP 0.5 M in acetonitrile.


The current–voltage characteristics were measured using the previously reported method with a solar simulator (AM-1.5, 100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co., Japan). Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cell, plotted as a function of excitation wavelength, was recorded on a CEP-2000 system (Bunkoh-Keiki Co. Ltd). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) at each incident wavelength was calculated from eqn (1), where Jsc is the photocurrent density at short circuit in mA cm−2 under monochromatic irradiation, λ is the wavelength of incident radiation in nm, and Pin is the incident radiative flux in W m−2.

The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were carried out by applying bias equivalent to the Voc of the device and recorded over a frequency of 0.01 Hz to 105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The above measurements were recorded with an electrochemical impedance analyser equipped with FRA.


SPS-01 structural drawing is depicted in Scheme 1. SPS-01 was prepared by direct treatment of [Ru(4,4′-bis(p-methylcarboxystyryl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(p-cymene)Cl]·Cl and 2-(3-(Trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridine in refluxing 2-methoxyethanol. After chromatographic separation, it was then hydrolyzed with 1 M NaOH solution at 100 °C for 24 h.

The normalized absorption spectra of SPS-01 in 1:1 acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol solvents is shown in Fig. 1a along with the absorption spectra of N719 for comparison. In addition to higher energy π–π* absorption around 334 nm, the SPS-01 exhibits two absorption at 418 nm and 532 nm attributable to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands mixed with a small amount of ligand to ligand charge transfer contribution. The optical band gap of the SPS-01 is estimated from the onset of the optical absorption which is 1.83 eV. The absorption spectra of SPS-01 adsorbed on TiO2 film is shown in Fig. 1b, along with the N719. After adsorbing these dyes on the TiO2 film, the optical absorption shows the redshift in the absorption band and an increase in intensity of the red tail. This was considered desirable as it increases the overlap with the solar spectrum and should result in a larger photocurrent.
In order to check the photo-stability of SPS-01, we have also measured the optical spectra of SPS-01 in solution at different time intervals as shown in Fig. S1, ESI. There was little observed change in the shape of the absorption band and any shift in the absorption edge. These observations indicate that SPS-01 is photostable.
Cyclic voltammetry was also performed to ensure that the LUMO level of SPS-01 is suited for injecting electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and to verify whether the HOMO level match the redox potential of electrolyte. The cyclic voltammograms of SPS-01 for three cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, are shown Fig. 2a. The onset oxidation potential is about 0.90 V (vs. NHE) which is due to the Ru(II) metal oxidation. This indicates that the oxidation potential of I−/I3− redox couple (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE) is more negative than the oxidation potential (HOMO level) of SPS-01 and is able to regenerate the dye effectively. The LUMO energy level of SPS-01 estimated from the difference between the HOMO level and the onset of the optical energy gap is −0.93 V, sufficiently more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE). We have not observed any shift in the peak at different cycles, which shows that the material is electrochemically stable in solution.
The cyclic voltammograms of SPS-01 were also measured at different scan rates i.e. 50 mV s−1, 200 mV s−1, 500 mV s−1 and 1000 mV s−1 and are shown in Fig. 2b. The oxidation onset potential does not change with the scan rate, however, the anodic current increases linearly with the scan rate voltage. This observation also indicates the electrochemical stability of SPS-01.
The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs based on SPS-01 and N719 sensitizers are shown in Fig. 3. The onset of IPCE spectra for the DSSCs based on SPS-01 and N719 are close to 810 nm and 780 nm, respectively and excellent IPCE performance was observed from 380 nm to 760 nm, for with 92.3% at 500 nm and 83% at 550 nm, for DSSCs based on SPS-01 and N719, respectively. These results indicates that the SPS-01 dye exhibits superior light harvesting capability than that of N719.

Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs under AM 1.5 G simulated light of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters i.e. short circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 1. Under standard AM 1.5 solar conditions, the SPS-01 sensitized solar cell gave a Jsc value of 17.74 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.66 V, and FF of 0.68, yielding an overall PCE of 7.96%. Under the same conditions, the N719 sensitized solar cell gave a Jsc value of 15.35 mA cm−2, Voc value of 0.67 V and FF of 0.71, yielding a PCE of 7.30%. The PCE of DSSCs sensitized with N719 dye is inferior to that of SPS-01, although FF for the former is higher. The higher PCE value of the SPS-01 solar cell compared to that of its N719 counterpart comes from the higher Jsc value, which can be rationalized by the high absorption coefficient and red shifted absorption of the MLCT band.

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis was also performed to elucidate the above photovoltaic findings.Fig. 5 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra for the DSSCs based on SPS-01 and N719 dyes under a forward bias of −0.65 V in the dark. Two semicircles are observed in Nyquist plots (Fig. 5a). The small and large semicircles respectively located in the high and middle frequency regions are assigned to the charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2 surface can be deduced by fitting curves from the range of middle frequency using Z-view software. Rrec is related to the charge recombination rate between injected electron and I3− ions in the electrolyte, estimated from the large semicircle width. A large Rrec means the small charge recombination rate and vice versa. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 5a) in the dark under a forward bias of 0.65 V show the radius of the middle semicircle to increase in order SPS-01 > N719, indicating that the electron recombination resistance is higher for the DSSC based on SPS-01 than that for N719. The higher value of the recombination resistance leads to slower recombination process in the DSSCs which is beneficial for a higher PCE value. The electron lifetime values derived from these curves fitting are 35 ms and 28 ms for SPS-01 and N719, respectively. The Bode phase plots shown in Fig. 5b also supports the difference in the electron lifetime for TiO2 films sensitized with these two dyes. The middle frequency peaks of the DSSCs based on SPS-01 shift to lower frequency relative to that of N719, indicating shorter recombination lifetime for the latter dye. The increase in recombination lifetime in the TiO2 film is associated with a pronounced rise in the charge transfer resistance, implying that the sensitization with SPS-01 decrease the interfacial rate constant for electron capture by I3− ions. In addition, at a high frequency region (103–105 Hz), the peak maximum is slightly shifted towards a lower frequency for SPS-01 than N719, which corresponds to the slower charge transfer at the counter electrode.

In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new thiocyanate-free sensitizer coded as SPS-01 and used it as the sensitizer for a TiO2 based nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The sensitizer has characteristic broad absorption MLCT band and high absorption coefficient. SPS-01 exhibits strong visible absorption properties with a maximum peak around at 532 nm. The overall power conversion efficiency of the DSSC sensitized with SPS-01 (7.96%) is higher than that for N719 (7.30%) under identical experimental conditions. The data presented in this paper strongly suggest that SPS-01 is indeed a viable sensitizer for nanocrystalline TiO2 based DSSCs.
