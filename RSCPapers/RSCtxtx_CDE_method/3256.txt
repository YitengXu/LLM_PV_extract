Adhesive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films were developed to increase the performance of photovoltaic devices. The films combined two separate features of moth-eye patterns to reduce the reflection of incident light at the film surface and luminescent down-shifting (LDS) CdZnS/ZnS-core/shell quantum dots (QDs) to convert ultraviolet (UV) radiation into visible light at 445 nm. The films were both flexible and self-adhesive, easily attachable to any surface of a solar cell module. By simply attaching the developed films on high-efficiency GaAs solar cells, the short circuit current density and power conversion efficiency of the solar cells increased to 33.8 mA cm−2 and 28.7%, by 1.1 mA cm−2 and 0.9 percentage points in absolute values, respectively. We showed that the enhancement of the GaAs solar cells was attributed to both the anti-reflection (AR) properties of the moth-eye patterns and the LDS of QDs using a scattering matrix method and external quantum efficiency measurements. The developed films are versatile in application for solar cells, and expected to aid in overcoming limits of material absorption and device structures.

Various concepts and techniques have been researched and developed for photovoltaic (PV) devices to improve their power conversion efficiency (PCE), which have resulted in progress in the last few decades. Among these concepts, optical approaches reducing reflection loss, and thus increasing the absorption of the incident light, are essential. Antireflection coatings (ARCs) are among the most common optical technologies for enhancing PV performance. Traditionally, ARCs were composed of layered structures of single or multiple dielectric thin films utilizing refractive index (RI) differences between the films and the substrates, following the optical interference modelled by the Fresnel equation. However, these layered thin film structures, simply using optical interference, were limited compared to ideal ARCs because the degree of optical interference depended on the wavelength, angle, and polarization of the incident light, which was difficult to resolve with only the traditional layered ARCs. Fortunately, nanotechnology inspired by biological structures not only overcomes these aforementioned limits but also provides multi-functionalities, such as broadband and quasi-omnidirectional antireflection, hydrophilic antifogging, or super-hydrophobic self-cleaning features, along with other optical, mechanical, and adhesive properties. In particular, the moth-eye nanostructure exhibits exceptional broadband and wide-angle performance compared with that of conventional ARCs. Therefore, the nanostructure is being commercially used for various applications such as camera lenses, light-emitting diodes, surface-emitting lasers, flat-panel displays, photodetectors, and solar cells. As a powerful ARC, it enhances the sensitivity, accuracy, or efficiency of the devices.

Another optical approach to improve PV performance utilizes the conversion of photons’ energies; when a photon's energy is either too high or too low for a solar cell to absorb, it must be converted to an energy easily absorbed by the cell. Photons with energies lower than the cell's bandgap cannot be absorbed, resulting in transmission loss for the solar cells. Up-conversion changes these low-energy photons into photons with energies absorbable by the solar cell. Meanwhile, high-energy photons, although captured in the front or window layers of solar cells, cannot contribute to photo-currents but add to thermal release. Down-shifting transforms these high-energy photons into photons which may not be easily absorbed in the front layers, but which are absorbable in the cell's active layers, thereby reducing both recombination and thermalization losses. Quantum-cutting splits a single extremely high-energy photon into two or more photons of moderate lower energy, which can eventually create a quantum efficiency (QE) greater than unity. For luminescent down-shifting (LDS) or quantum-cutting materials, organic dyes, rare-earth-doped organic complexes, and quantum dots (QDs) are used. Among these, QDs have the potential to perform as ideal converting materials, with their high absorption coefficient, high luminescence quantum efficiency, and long-term stability. As for QD-encapsulating host materials, polymers, inorganic crystalline materials, and organic molecule silicates with characteristics of both high transmittance and low scattering are commonly used.
In the present study, we fabricated a multifunctional polymer film for GaAs solar cells, capable of both down-shifting photons with embedded QDs and reducing reflections with moth-eye nanopatterns as ARC layers. For the QD-hosting material, a commonly used Si-based organic polymer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was chosen, because it is already widely used as a component in ARC materials. Since the morphology of polymers is easy to control, and as they are easily adhered to flexible substrates, they can be fabricated into adhesive sticker-like films, potentially permitting low-cost and large-area film production.
Generally, core/shell structures are known to be able to control the absorption and emission spectra, as well as enhance the so-called Stokes shift by engineering the geometry of the structure and dopants. The proper selection of ligands can help the uniform dispersion. The CdZnS/ZnS core/shell-structured QDs we selected in this work have strong absorption for UV light, high quantum yield, and good stability.
We embedded LDS QDs on the top of the PDMS films, imprinted moth-eye nanostructures on the surface of the QD-hosting PDMS layer, and then simply attached the fabricated films to the front surface of highly efficient GaAs solar cells. In comparison with other previous investigations of ARC and LDS, this work is novel in two respects. First, LDS materials are incorporated with an ARC into one film. Using this film, we improved the PCE of the high-performance GaAs solar cell by 0.9%, to 28.7% from 27.8%. Most previous LDS materials showed relative improvements only in low-efficiency solar cells because little room remained in the highly efficient solar cells for LDS-induced improvement. Second, most previously reported ARCs or LDS layers were fixed in the cell through patterning or encapsulation. However, our developed all-in-one film (LDS and ARC) is fabricated separately from the devices. It can be easily attached and detached, and even repeatedly attached to any solar cell surface without additional adhesives, similar to a sticker. Thus, this sticker-like film can be applied to various types of PV devices under their as-fabricated conditions, as well as to the cover glass of conventional crystalline Si solar modules, because of the manufacturing capability of large-area films. The present achievement is expected to address the applications of GaAs cells in space; the improvement by LDS will be enhanced without air mass, and the devices under the LDS/ARC films will be protected from damage by UV light irradiation.

A Si mold was nanopatterned by a polystyrene (PS) bead monolayer using a self-assembly method, and using the Si mold, biomimetic moth-eye-like patterns were imprinted on a PDMS film by the imprinting process shown in Fig. 1. The detailed processes of fabricating the nanopatterned PDMS films are described in the Experimental section. The film itself used two varieties of PDMS of very thin hard PDMS (h-PDMS) and thick soft PDMS (s-PDMS) in dual layers. The h-PDMS, necessary to hold protuberant moth-eye patterns with an aspect ratio >1 (1.38 in this work), permits the creation of high-quality nanopatterns, preventing the collapsing or clustering of protuberant shapes during the fabrication. The s-PDMS aids in controlling the fabrication process, permitting easy handling of the films. Because of the thick s-PDMS layer, the fabricated film can maintain its sheet form, and can be repeatedly and manually attached to or detached from the surface of the GaAs solar cell devices.

For the LDS material, we selected CdZnS/ZnS core/shell-structured QDs (Nanosquare, Inc.), which absorb UV light and emit blue light centered at 445 nm with a quantum yield of more than 50%. The absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the QDs in solution is shown in Fig. 2a, showing that absorption mainly occurs in the wavelength range below 445 nm and the centering of the PL emission peak at 445 nm. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Fig. 2b shows that the average diameter of QDs is approximately 7 nm. After the imprinting Si mold was prepared, the QD-dispersed h-PDMS was coated on the mold to form the moth-eyes; the thickness of the h-PDMS layer was ∼2 μm. Over the h-PDMS-coated Si mold, transparent s-PDMS layers of ∼100 μm in thickness were coated, and finally, the h/s-PDMS film with both moth-eye nanopatterns and LDS QDs was peeled away from the Si mold.
Flaws frequently occur in imprinted structures during the peeling-off process. Notably, in our work we overcame this common failure by peeling off the films in a CH3OH solution bath. The fabricated moth-eye-nanopatterned and QD-embedded PDMS film remains transparent to visible light, while it emits strong blue light under UV irradiation, as shown in Fig. 2c and e, respectively. The final fabricated moth-eyes of the QD-embedded h-PDMS are corn-shaped with average bottom diameters of ∼240 nm and heights of ∼340 nm, as shown via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Fig. 2d. Therefore, both nanopatterned and QD-embedded PDMS film is expected to function dually and effectively as both a down-shifter and an ARC, thus improving the solar cell efficiency.
To evaluate the effects of LDS and ARC on PCE, we fabricated highly efficient single-junction GaAs solar cells grown sequentially on an n-type (n-) GaAs substrate in the following order: 300 nm n-GaAs contact and buffer, 50 nm n-GaInP back-surface-field (BSF), 3500 nm n-GaAs base, 500 nm p-type (p-) GaAs emitter, 30 nm p-GaInP window, and 60 nm Si3N4 ARC as a reference cell. The thickness of the Si3N4 ARC was optimized to achieve 27.8% efficiency for the reference cell. The reference cell was compared with a flat PDMS cell (a cell covered by a flat PDMS film with neither patterns nor down-shifting QDs), a patterned PDMS cell (a cell with a moth-eye nanopatterned ARC PDMS film but without down-shifting QDs), and patterned QD-embedded PDMS cells (cells covered by a nanopatterned PDMS film with various wt% of down-shifting QDs). A schematic of the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film on the GaAs solar cell is shown in Fig. 3a, and the cross-sectional TEM images of the GaAs cell are provided in Fig. S1. We measured the performance variation for the different types of PDMS films on the same reference cell. In Fig. 3b and c, the cells’ PV performances improve sequentially in the order of flat, patterned, and patterned QD-embedded PDMS cells. Compared to the reference cell, the short circuit current density (JSC) and the PCE increase by 0.2 mA cm−2 and 0.2% in the flat cell; a further increase by 0.7 mA cm−2 and 0.6% occurs in the patterned PDMS cells. This indicates that the moth-eye structures effectively reduce the reflection at the surface, as shown in Fig. 3d. The presence of moth-eye patterns gradually increases the effective refractive index in the patterned PDMS layer, thus enhancing the incident light's coupling into the solar cells. Furthermore, the 0.3 wt% QD-embedded patterned PDMS cell shows the highest JSC and PCE values. The open circuit voltage (VOC) and the fill factor (FF) remain constant regardless of the cell type. Thus, the LDS by the QDs embedded in the h-PDMS layer are expected to have increased the number of photons absorbable by the solar cells. Notably, the blue PL of the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film is much stronger than that of the flat QD-embedded PDMS film (a cell covered by a non-patterned PDMS film with down-shifting QDs) as shown in Fig. S2a. This is mainly because the patterned film not only minimizes surface reflectance, but it also enhances the light extraction efficiency. In Fig. S2b, photons of shorter wavelengths were effectively absorbed in the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film. Therefore, the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film very effectively enhances the UV absorption and extracts the emitted blue light out of the film.
However, the increments in JSC and PCE do not fully explain how the LDS or reflection reduction contributed to the efficiency improvement. Therefore, we analyzed the external quantum efficiency (EQE) response of the GaAs cells both with and without the PDMS films using a scattering (S-) matrix method. In the S-matrix method, the behavior of light in an optical device is expressed as lightwave vectors, consisting of both coherent waves and incoherent light-intensity components. The components of the S-matrix are the functions of wavelength, angle and polarization of incident light, refractive indices of materials, and scattering effects at the material boundaries, which represent the reflections and transmissions occurring at a material boundary or the amplitude and phase changes for the components of the lightwave vectors in specific materials. The S-matrix can analyze coherent and incoherent light simultaneously, which is very useful for actual applications under the recommended conditions of air mass 1.5 ground (AM1.5G) irradiating 80% direct normal (coherent) and 20% diffuse (incoherent) incident light. The S-matrix demonstrated that the analyzed photocurrents in thin-film amorphous Si solar cells were matched well with the measured results.
In this work, we modelled the GaAs solar cells characterized in Table 1 using S-matrices. The LDS efficiency is not only affected by the internal quantum efficiency (conversion efficiency down-shifting absorbed photons) of LDS materials but also by the optical structure of the device's front or rear sides of the LDS layer. Therefore, the LDS effect solely measured from an LDS layer could only be different from that of an LDS layer used in an optical device as a part of an optical system. Rothemund and Alonso-Álvarez et al. approached the modeling of LDS based on the measurements for sequential layered structures assuming that their LDS process was somewhat independent of the device structure. Our S-matrix's differentiation is to treat the LDS process considering the optical effects of other layers in the device. Since the LDS effect was an output component of the S-matrices for the GaAs solar cell, we could find the LDS effect on the EQE characteristics of the GaAs cells, as shown in Fig. 4. The refractive index of PDMS is between that of air and Si3N4. The EQEs of the flat and patterned PDMS cells exceed those of the reference and bare (without the Si3N4 ARC) cells. The patterned PDMS cell has one more layer with the intermediate effective refractive index of air and PDMS; the EQE of the patterned PDMS cell slightly exceeds that of the flat PDMS cell. In general, luminescent light is easily coupled into higher-refractive-index materials; we assumed that 75% of emitted light entered into the GaAs cell direction. In Fig. 4a, the EQE in the UV (300–400 nm) range is enhanced for the patterned QD-embedded PDMS cell, while the EQE in the visible range is similar to that of the patterned PDMS cell. The relatively higher response in the UV region can be attributed to the LDS of the embedded QDs. The QD LDS converts UV light into light centered at 445 nm, suppressing the absorption loss in the p-GaInP layer. Fig. 4b shows the simulated optical losses in p-GaInP layers and the LDS emission spectra, demonstrating that the loss in the patterned QD-embedded PDMS cell is lower than that of the patterned QD-free PDMS cells. The photons absorbed in the QD-embedded PDMS layer are converted into DS photons. To consider the internal scattering of emission for QDs in the PDMS films, the DS photons are modeled as light with the angular distributed intensity of the Lambertian cosine function in the S-matrix method, and we assumed that the initial emission of the DS photons in the QD-embedded PDMS film was equally out in both the forward (toward the cell) and backward (toward air) direction. The S-matrix can trace the journey of the DS photons in the cell for the emission wavelength considering the optical structure of the devices and calculate the LDS effects for the device structure. Fig. 4c shows that the DS photons escaped to air, were absorbed into the cell (gain or loss), and re-absorbed into the QD-embedded PDMS layer. In Fig. 4d, although the initial emission ratios of the forward and backward directions were equal, after bouncing back and forth, the overall forward emission ratios (the photons absorbed in the cell side for total emitted photons) are higher than the backward emission ratio. The average forward emission ratio was approximately 59% in our calculation, which corresponds to reports that the luminescent light is easily coupled into higher-refractive-index materials (to the cell) in general. In this way, the S-matrix can calculate the structural effect on the LDS process; in our calculation, the LDS efficiency was approximately 48% for the absorbed photons in the UV range.

The LDS converts UV light into photons favored for absorption in the GaAs cell's active layer, suppressing loss in p-GaInP and enhancing EQE in the patterned QD-embedded PDMS cell, as shown in Fig. 4. It can also be confirmed from the measurements of reflectance and EQE as shown in Fig. 3d and e, where more increments of JSC and PCE in the UV region were observed rather than in the visible region. In order to more clearly demonstrate the LDS effect, we introduced the EQE enhancement factor (EF). The EQE EF compares two cells’ EQE values by dividing the EQE value of one cell by that of the other cell. In Fig. 3f, we compare the EQE EFs of the patterned QD-embedded PDMS cell with the reference cell, and the patterned QD-embedded PDMS cell with the patterned PDMS cell. The EQE EF is higher than unity in the UV region, in contrast with that in the visible region (500–800 nm). The calculated JSC (integrating the EQE over the solar spectrum) for the reference, flat, patterned, and patterned QD-embedded PDMS cells of Fig. 3e are 26.13, 26.18, 26.49, and 26.54 mA cm−2, respectively. JSC thus increased by 0.2, 1.4, and 1.5% from the reference for the flat, patterned, and patterned QD-embedded PDMS cells, respectively. Although these values are smaller than those given in Table S1 due to the imperfections in the light sources used in the EQE and J–V measurements, the measurement results are coherent for the type of cells. We may therefore conclude that LDS by the embedded QDs enhances the cell performance in the UV region.
Some differences are found between the measured and calculated results of EQE shown in Fig. 3 and 4, which could be due to the following reasons. Our calculations used the optical parameters (n–k values) of materials in the cell from the literature. However, during the fabrication process, mismatches in the material compositions of the binary and ternary materials or lattice stress can be introduced that would alter the n–k values, which are not easy to measure and quantify in general. In addition, in the LDS process, it was assumed that the absorbed photons were down-shifted into the longer wavelength range at an identical rate because in this work, we did not control the interactions between the energy levels of the electron–hole carriers at the QDs. Thus, the enhancement of LDS was higher for shorter wavelengths in Fig. 4a in comparison with Fig. 3e, although Fig. 4a is still in accordance with the experimental results for the absorption of the LDS material (PL of Fig. 2a and EQE of Fig. 3e). Considering secondary effects such as re-absorption in the LDS layer or emission quenching at local aggregates of QDs, the performance at shorter wavelengths could be overestimated in the calculation. However, we want to note that the S-matrix explains the behavior of DS photons and the LDS effect in the whole device structure well, as shown in Fig. 4.
In addition, PV performance varies with QD concentration; however, factors detrimental to the cell's PCE, which might be attributed to denser distributions of QDs, are also to be considered. Such detrimental factors are film opacity, re-absorption, in which QDs re-absorb previously emitted photons from other QDs due to some overlap between the emission region and the absorption region, and quenching, which is a non-radiative luminescence process where excitation energy is not converted into photons but rather dissipated by thermal energy. QDs might easily aggregate with increasing QD concentration, which worsens the detrimental factors to the PCE. Thus, a trade-off between PCE and QD concentration is expected. In Fig. S3 and Table S1 for the range of 0.2–1.2 QD wt% (0.0013–0.0139 kg m−2 of the area density of QDs), the best performance of GaAs cells is obtained with the patterned PDMS film containing 0.3 wt% QD; a further increase of the QD concentration decreases JSC and PCE.
Further, we want to discuss the reliability of the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film in both attachment and detachment. In attaching a PDMS film onto a cell, if a small amount of air is trapped in the gap between them, according to the calculation of the S-matrix, the EQE response of the cells with the PDMS film approaches that of the reference cell. Thus, we carefully attached the films onto the cell in order to avoid making air bubbles. We attached and detached the identical films used for Fig. 3 ten times on three different cells. We then measured PCE, JSC, and EQE, which were consistent in the different cells, as shown in Fig. S4. Also, the EQEs of the cell using the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film did not change after repeating the attaching/detaching experiment three times, as shown in Fig. S5. Therefore, the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film is highly reproducible in terms of improving the GaAs cell. For the stability of QDs in PDMS films, we investigated the degradation in PL of the QD-embedded PDMS films using accelerated stress test conditions: UVA (325 nm) irradiation in air. Under these conditions, photo-oxidation easily occurred at the surfaces of both the QD core and the shell. Although the shell protects the QD core from oxygen, the structural incompleteness of the shell (dislocations or grain boundaries) allows oxygen diffusion into the core. The QDs degraded, losing PL after 64 h, as shown in Fig. S6, which is somewhat better in terms of sustainability in comparison with previous reports because of the PDMS encapsulation of the QDs.

We developed adhesive PDMS films capable of both down-shifting high-energy photons into low-energy photons absorbable by solar cells and reducing incident light reflections to improve the performance of high-efficiency solar cells. The developed PDMS films were embedded with luminescent CdZnS/ZnS core/shell-structured QDs, which absorbed UV light and emitted blue light with peak emission at 445 nm. The films were additionally patterned with nanoscale moth-eye ARC shapes on their surfaces. The fabricated films were both flexible and adhesive, permitting easy attachment and detachment, as well as repeated use on any surface of a PV device. By adhering the developed PDMS film onto highly efficient GaAs solar cells, we achieved improved JSC and PCE values of 33.8 mA cm−2 and 28.7%, respectively, which represent increments of 1.1 mA cm−2 and 0.9% in absolute values over the original 27.8% PCE of the GaAs cell. Using S-matrix analysis and the results of EQE measurements, we showed that the moth-eye patterns effectively reduced the reflection of incident light at the surface of the PDMS films, while LDS by the embedded QDs enhanced the photocurrent of the GaAs solar cells in the UV wavelength range. The patterned QD-embedded PDMS films developed in this work are independent of the type or structure of the solar cells to which they can be applied. Using these PDMS films, solar cells with performances overcoming material absorption limits and structural constraints could be developed in the near future.


B-doped p-Si wafers (Waferbiz, Inc.) of 275 ± 15 μm thickness and 2 inch diameter were prepared and divided into 1 cm2 substrates to form the bases of the imprinting molds. Chloromethyl latex PS beads (CureBio, Inc.) of 0.42 μm diameter and 4% w/v were diluted by 1:1 in ethanol to coat the Si base, forming a compact PS monolayer which created a self-assembled mask, according to the Langmuir–Blodgett method. The PS beads were etched by O2 plasma in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etcher (Oxford Instruments Inc.) with 70 sccm O2 flow until the filling ratio of the PS monolayer reached ∼60%. A 100 nm thick Cr layer was deposited by an electron beam evaporator (ULVAC Inc.) onto the bare Si in the empty spaces among the etched PS beads. After rinsing the PS beads with CHCl3 and etching the surface of the Si base for ∼200 s with mixed Ar and Cl2 gases in the ICP etcher, the intaglio of moth-eye shapes was formed on the Si mold. Finally, the Cr mask was removed with the (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 + HNO3 Cr etchant. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film was added to the nanopatterned Si mold as an anti-adherent layer to ease the peeling away of the prepared PDMS films from the mold.


An h-PDMS compound was prepared using copolymers (Gelest, Inc.) as follows: 0.5 g VDT-731 (vinylmethylsiloxane–dimethylsiloxane copolymers terminated with trimethylsiloxy) was mixed with 2.648 μL SIP6831.2LC (platinum–divinyltetramethyl–disiloxane complex in xylene) and stirred for 30 s. Then, 17.645 mg SIT7900.0 (1,3,5,7-tetravinyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane) was added to the mixture, which was stirred again for 30 s. Lastly, 0.145 g HMS-301 (methylhydrosiloxane–dimethylsiloxane copolymers with trimethylsiloxy terminated) was added, with a further stirring of 30 s. Before blending with the h-PDMS compound, a solution of toluene-dissolved CdZnS/ZnS 445 core/shell-type QDs (Nanosquare, Inc.) of 10 mg mL−1 was diluted by 1:2 with toluene to reach the density of 3.333 mg mL−1. Then, 350 μL, 500 μL, 1000 μL, and 2000 μL of the diluted QDs were injected into h-PDMS compounds and stirred for 2 h. After removing bubbles from the h-PDMS mixed with QDs in a vacuum chamber, 100 μL of each sample of the compound was spin-coated onto the nanopatterned Si mold at 6000 rpm for 6 min. After baking at 60 °C for 30 min on a hot plate, the QD-embedded h-PDMS layer remained on the mold with a thickness of 1.5–2 μm. The s-PDMS compound was 1 mL of the Sylgard-184 elastomer base mixed with 100 μL of the Sylgard-184 curing agent (Dow Corning Co.). After removing bubbles from the s-PDMS compound in the vacuum chamber, 100 μL of the s-PDMS compound was spin-coated over the QD-embedded h-PDMS layer on the Si mold at 1000 rpm for 30 s. Baking at 90 °C for 1 h caused a 100 μm thick s-PDMS layer to form on the h-PDMS layer. We peeled off the patterned QD-embedded PDMS film from the mold after submerging it in a CH3OH solution, which prevented the collapsing and clustering of the PDMS film's nanopatterns during the peeling-off process.


For the GaAs solar cells, we modelled the S-matrices of all individual layers in the reference cell as listed in Table 1; the refractive indices of GaAs-based materials were obtained from the literature, and those of the PDMS films were used as measured in Fig. 2a. All the components of the S-matrix and their relationships with the components of the lightwave vectors are described in ref. 53. For the nanopatterned region of the PDMS, we used the effective refractive index of PDMS with air, considering the volume ratio. Using the initial input of solar irradiation, and iterating by re-using the S-matrix output as the iterated S-matrix input, the EQE responses of the GaAs cells were calculated. The outputs of the S-matrix representing the QD-embedded PDMS region correspond to the lightwaves propagating through this region, where some part of UV-lightwaves absorbed by QDs, was converted into visible lightwaves emitted by the LDS effect. In this way, the contribution of the patterned QD-embedded PDMS films to the enhancement of the photocurrent was calculated.


In this work, absorbance was measured by using a Cary 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc.) with an integrating sphere; the PL signal was generated and detected with an IK3452R-F He–Cd 325 nm laser source (Kimmon Electric Co., Ltd), a KR1801C power supply (Kimmon Koha Co., Ltd), and a SP2150 spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, Inc.).

The electrical properties of the GaAs cells were measured under 1 Sun conditions (100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5G) with an XES-301s Xe lamp (San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd), an XEC-301s lamp controller (San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd), and an SMU 2400 source meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc.).
The reflectance and the EQE were measured with a K3100 spectral IPCE measurement system, K102 signal amplifier, K240 XE 300 lamp source, K401 CW500 lamp controller (McScience Co., Ltd), and an optical chopper (Thorlabs, Inc.).
