Wide band gap polymers (Eg > 2 eV) are essential to polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to their potential applications in tandem solar cells. In this study, three wide band gap polymers, P1, P2, and P3, were synthesized by Stille coupling of the electron-acceptor unit of phthalimide (PhI) and the electron-donor unit of 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy), 4,8-bis(n-dodecyloxy) and 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) benzodithiophene (BDT), respectively, and then were physicochemically characterized. Optical tests found that all these three polymers displayed a film absorption peak around 500 nm and their optical band gap is in the range of 2.07–2.13 eV. Electrochemical tests indicated that the three polymers possess deeply layered HOMO energy levels (−5.36 eV to −5.57 eV). P1 is poorly soluble, however P2 and P3 were both applied in PSCs with PC71BM as the electron-acceptor material. The photovoltaic tests indicated that both the polymers exhibited a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V (P2) and 0.89 V (P3) because of their deeper HOMOs than P3HT. Polymer P2 with 4,8-bis(n-dodecyloxy) BDT as the electron-donor unit exhibited poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.50%, while P3, containing 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) BDT and PhI, exhibited a promising PCE of 3.70%. This significant increase of the PCE is mainly from the nearly 2-fold increase of the short-circuit current density, Jsc (7.01 mA cm−2vs. 3.43 mA cm−2) and also from an improvement in both the fill factor, FF (58.6% vs. 54.7%), and Voc (0.89 V vs. 0.80 V). We attribute the promoted photovoltaic performance of P3 with respect to P2 to its broader absorption, deeper HOMO level, weaker molecular aggregation, better miscibility with PC71BM, optimized film morphology, and finally, better hole mobility compared to P2, all of which originated from the structure differences between alkoxyl and alkylthienyl BDT. The PCE for P3 is, to the best of our knowledge, among the top 2 efficiencies for the wide band gap polymers (the highest one is 5.04% reported very recently in Polym. Chem., 2013, 4, 57) and the highest efficiency reported to date for PhI-based polymers. Our results enriched the tool-box for wide band gap polymers with enhanced efficiencies higher than 3.5%. Accordingly, the wide band gap polymer, P3, should be a potential candidate for applications in tandem solar cells.

Active research devoted to the field of conjugated polymers has led to a rapid increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs), which has been enhanced to as high as 9.2% very recently. Currently, most research is focused on design and synthesis of low band gap polymers (Eg< 2 eV), with deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and raised highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which possess red-shifted UV-vis absorption spectra by up to 600–900 nm and usually afford an enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, wide band gap polymers (Eg > 2 eV), overlooked by the mainstream subject of conjugated polymers, are still of vital importance to the photovoltaic devices. For example, a wide band gap polymer usually represents a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) because of its deep HOMO energy level. Moreover, broad band gap polymers also have important applications, for example, in tandem solar cells, which involve two stacking active layers, absorbing different part of the solar spectrum. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a typical medium band gap (Eg = 2.0 eV). Its PCEs is typically in the range of 3.0–4.0% when blended with PCBM and it can be improved by up to 5.0% after various processing optimizations and device modifications. Currently, most of the tandem solar cells utilize P3HT as the medium band gap component to harvest solar radiation from 300 nm to 600 nm. However, its red-shifted absorption edge usually overlaps with the counterpart, the low band gap polymer, which has been proved to have negative effects on the efficiency of tandem solar cells. So, development of highly efficient wide band gap polymers with the compromised blue-shifted absorption, is emergent for the advances of tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, the reported efficiency is still low, typically, <3.0%, except the very recently reported value of up to 5.04%.

Copolymers based on the phthalimide (PhI) unit have been widely reported for organic electronic applications due to their symmetric, rigidly fused, coplanar structure, and weakly electron-withdrawing ability, all of which benefit PhI as a promising electron-acceptor unit for constructing wide band gap polymers. However, the photovoltaic performance of those copolymers are still poor and the highest PCE based on those polymers reported to date is still 2.0%. The low efficiency is strongly related to the poor Jsc. Therefore, designing wide band gap polymers, for example, with a strong light harvesting ability, weak aggregation effect, good miscibility with PCBM, and efficient carrier transport will be the key way toward high efficiency.
Recently, we have reported that incorporation of a thienyl unit onto the 4,7-positions of the PhI unit may enhance the coplanarity of the polymer backbone through the S⋯O interactions and thus improve the hole mobility and further PSC's efficiency. Following this design strategy, we selected benzodithiophene (BDT) derivatives as the electron-donor unit because they were recently reported to have excellent charge transport ability and enhanced Voc when incorporated into the copolymers. Accordingly, we synthesized three wide band gap copolymers of P1, P2, and P3 by using 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy), 4,8-bis(n-dodecyloxy) and 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) benzodithiophene (BDT) as the electron-donor unit, respectively, and using PhI as the electron-acceptor unit (Scheme 1).
Firstly, P1 with 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy) BDT as the donor unit was synthesized. Unfortunately, it has poor solubility in the commonly used organic solvents such as toluene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and chloroform (CF), due to the limited bulk volume of 2-ethylhexyl side-chains and strong dipolar interactions between the bisalkyloxyl BDT. So no further characterizations were carried out for P1 except for FTIR, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-vis absorption and electrochemistry. Then, n-dodecyloxyl was introduced onto the 4,8-positions of the BDT unit for the purpose of improving solubility to obtain P2. To be further, the two-dimensionally conjugate BDT with 2-ethylhexylthienyl as the side chains was introduced to obtain P3 for the purpose of reducing the aggregation effect from the bisalkyloxyl BDT. After various physiochemical characterizations, we found that these PhI-based copolymers have a wide optical band gap (2.07–2.13 eV) and show film absorption at ca. ∼500 nm. P2, with n-dodecyloxyl BDT as the electron-donor unit, exhibited poor efficiency of 1.50% with a poor Jsc of 3.43 mA cm−2, while P3, containing 2-ethylhexylthienyl BDT as the electron-donor unit exhibited a promising PCE of 3.70% with a significantly improved Jsc of 7.01 mA cm−2.

Scheme 2 shows the synthetic routes toward the three polymers. The starting materials of distannyl monomers of BDT were purchased from Solarmer company and the dibrominated monomers were synthesized according to the literature methods. A typical Pd-catalysed Stille coupling reaction was applied to obtain the three copolymers. Unfortunately, the solubility of P1 was too limited in the commonly used organic solvents to purify and further characterize. P2 and P3 exhibit good solubility in the commonly used organic solvents such as CF, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and o-DCB. Compared to P1, the improved solubility of P2 can be attributed to the elongation of side chains without changing the conjugated backbone. Otherwise, with respect to P1, although P3's conjugation was enlarged without elongating the side chains, it also exhibited good solubility, which can be ascribed to the weakly polarized thiophene compared to oxygen and the distortion between the thiophene and BDT units, leading to weak aggregation effect, as will discussed in XRD data.
The thermal stability of the three polymers was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1.Td of the polymers, which represents the 5% weight loss temperature under an inert atmosphere, was found to be 338 °C, 337 °C, and 425 °C for P1, P2, and P3, respectively, indicating that the three polymers are stable enough for other characterization.
The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of P2 and P3 was 8.5 and 15.5 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.4 and 2.8, respectively. The average number of repeating unit deduced from Mn for P1 and P2 was 9.0 and 15.5, respectively. We have to note that the effective conjugation length for P3HT is 9–11 thiophene units. Herein, the average conjugation length for P1 and P2 is long enough for charge delocalization and transportation.

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of P1, P2, and P3 in chloroform and in the solid state, respectively, and the optical data of P1–P3 are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the three polymers P1, P2, and P3 showed an absorption maximum (λamax) at 471 nm, 485 nm, and 486 nm, with a full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) of 145 nm, 150 nm, and 177 nm in solution, respectively. Compared to P1 and P2, the enlarged fwhm of P3 can be attributable to the introduction of 2-ethylhexylthienyl BDT unit, which enlarged the conjugation and led to the enhanced absorption from 300 nm to 400 nm. After spin-coated into the thin film, λamax of P1, P2, and P3 located at 490 nm, 505 nm, and 507 nm (Fig. 1b), with a red-shift of 19 nm, 20 nm, and 21 nm, respectively, compared to their solution absorption peak, indicating that the polymeric backbones form π–π stacks in the solid state. The fwhm of P1, P2, and P3 in the film was 169 nm, 175 nm, and 199 nm, respectively. Compared to P1 and P2, the enhanced fwhm of P3 can be readily ascribed to regular alkyl chain and enlarged conjugation of 2D-BDT. Compared to P2, P3 exhibited similar absorbance at per 100 nm film thickness but broader absorption in film, indicating its slightly stronger light-harvesting ability, which is an important factor affecting the current density of PSCs. Optical band gaps (Eoptg) calculated from the film absorption edge (λaedge) were 2.13 eV, 2.10 eV and 2.07 V, respectively, decreasing from P1 to P2 and P3. Accordingly, solutions of P1, P2 and P3 all show red color in 5 mg mL−1 concentration (Fig. S2).

Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the three polymers with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The three polymers exhibit quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction processes. Empirical equation of EHOMO/LUMO = −(4.4 + Eonset(ox/red)) eV was applied to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, using the onset of oxidation/reduction potentials. As displayed in Table 1, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P2 were −5.36 eV and −3.02 eV, which were close to that of P1 (HOMO = −5.42 eV, LUMO = −3.05 eV), implying that the alkyl chains imposed little impact on the energy levels of polymers. Compared to P2, P3 showed similar LUMO, but deeper HOMO, which was consistent with the literature results. As the PSCs based on P3HT/PCBM usually give a Voc of 0.6 V, higher Voc than 0.6 V can be anticipated due to the deeper HOMOs of P1–P3 compared to P3HT's HOMO. We have to note that the electrochemical band gaps (ECVg) of P1–P3 were estimated to be 2.37 eV, 2.34 eV, and 2.50 eV, and all were somewhat larger than their corresponding optical band-gaps (Eoptg), presumably resulting from the relatively higher binding energy of the excitons in the polymer film when applied to the CV measurements.

Except for the poorly soluble P1, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of P2 and P3 and P2/PC71BM and P3/PC71BM (Fig. 3) were tested by drop-casting the respective o-DCB solutions on the silica substrates. Diffraction peaks at 3–5° are ascribed to the interchain distance separated by the alkyl side chains (100), while weak peaks at ∼25° can be assigned to the π–π stacking between polymeric backbones (010).Table 2 shows the diffraction degrees and the corresponding periodic distances, derived from the Bragg formula of 2dsin θ = λ, herein λ = 1.5418 Å. For the pristine films, P2 displayed the largest edge–edge distance of 24.3 Å, due to its long side chain of n-dodecyl. P3 showed a shorter edge–edge distance of 21.3 Å because of its short side chains. P2 and P3 exhibited similar π–π stacking distances of 3.61 Å, and 3.60 Å.

After blending with PC71BM, the stacking order of P2 in (100) and (010) directions was not obviously interrupted by the PC71BM, with the (100) distance of 24.4 Å and the (010) distance of 3.63 Å. However, for P3, the (100) distance was altered to be 19.9 Å after blending with PC71BM. Moreover, the π–π stacking order of P3 was apparently interrupted by PC71BM with a rather weak (010) diffraction peak. These differences can be explained by the structure diversity of alkoxyl substituted BDT and 2-ethylhexylthienyl substituted BDT. For P2, the strong dipolar interaction between the bisalkyloxyl BDT offer strong intermolecular interaction between polymer chains, leading to enhanced aggregation for P2. When the alkoxyl was replaced by 2-ethylhexylthienyl, the intermolecular interaction was weakened due to the weakly polarized thiophene compared to oxygen and the distortion between the thiophene and BDT units. Compared to P2, the relatively weaker aggregation ability of P3 resulted in better miscibility with PC71BM, as shown by AFM, which is partially responsible for its high fill factor (FF).

The photovoltaic performance of P2 and P3 was evaluated by fabricating PSCs using PC71BM as the electron-acceptor material and with the conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. After the donor/acceptor ratio was optimized (Table S1), the best device results for P2 and P3 were obtained, as shown in Table 3, and Fig. 4 shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the champion devices prepared from P2 and P3, which were obtained under illumination of an AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The best devices based on P2/PC71BM were obtained when the D/A ratio was 1:1 and showed a Jsc of 3.43 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V, an FF of 54.7%, and a PCE of 1.50%, which are close to the results of polymers with a similar structure reported in the literature. Polymer P3 with 2-ethylhexylthienyl BDT as the electron-donor unit exhibited a promising photovoltaic performance, and the champion devices were fabricated when the D/A ratio was 1:2 and showed a PCE of 3.70%. The improved efficiency mainly originates from the more than 2-fold increase of the Jsc (7.01 vs. 3.43 mA cm−2). Also, P3 shows an increasing Voc of 0.89 V and an improved FF of 58.6% compared to P2. The increase of Voc is consistent with the deeper HOMO of P3 than P2 (−5.57 vs. −5.36 eV). We have to note that the PCE of P2 is, to the best of our knowledge, among the top 2 efficiencies for the wide band gap polymers, which is lower than that value of 5.04% reported very recently from the bithiazole (BTz)-based polymers, and is the highest value reported to date for the PhI-based copolymers and that result enriched the tool-box for wide band gap polymers with PCEs higher than 3.5%.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized devices based on P2 and P3 were tested and shown in Fig. 5. Both the curves exhibited a broad response from 300 nm to 700 nm and are consistent with their respective UV-vis absorption profile of the blended films (Fig. S3), indicating that the absorbed photons contribute to the photovoltaic conversion. The maximum monochromatic EQEs are 20% and 48% for the devices based on P2 and P3, respectively. The current density calculated from the integral of the EQE curves are, respectively, 2.97 mA cm−2 and 6.20 mA cm−2, both consistent with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves.

We tested the hole mobilities of pristine P2 and P3 in films by fabricating organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) with bottom-contact configurations, as detailed in the experimental part. As shown in Fig. 6, both P2 and P3 show typical p-channel semiconducting properties with clear current modulations and well-defined linear and saturation regions. P2 exhibited a hole mobility (μh) of 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 4). Replacement of the alkoxyl BDT with the alkylthienyl BDT yielded a significant increase of μh: P3 showed a hole mobility of 1.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was augmented by more than one order of magnitude.

To get more insight into the hole transporting properties in the photovoltaic devices, the hole mobilities of P2/PC71BM and P3/PC71BM were further evaluated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S4). The test details are described in the experimental section. The average hole mobility for P2/PC71BM and P3/PC71BM were collected in Table 4. P2 showed a hole mobility of 3.0 × 10−9 cm2 V−1 s−1 in blending film. The poor hole mobility is partially responsible for the low Jsc and PCE. When the 2-ethylhexylthienyl BDT was incorporated, P3 exhibited an improved hole mobility of 1.0 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 in blending film, which is consistent with its well-defined film morphology, as will discussed in AFM and TEM data. It is worth noting that the large difference between the values evaluated from the OTFTs and SCLC method may be due to, on the one hand, the interruption resulting from PC71BM in the blending films compared to the pristine films, and on the other hand, the different orientations of the polymeric backbones in the OTFT devices and in the photovoltaic devices.
We have to note that although the XRD patterns of P2 are more significant than P3, both the pristine P3 and P3/PC71BM film exhibit higher hole mobility than that of P2 and P2/PC71BM. We attribute that improvement to the enlarged conjugation of 2D-BDT with respect to 1D-BDT and the higher molecular weight of P3 compared to P2. It is rationally concluded that the enhanced Jsc of P3 was partially owing to its relatively higher hole mobility compared to P2. Although the balance of hole mobility and electron mobility is an essential factor that can affect the photovoltaic performances, we failed to test the electron mobilities of P2/PC71BM and P3/PC71BM with ITO/TIPD/active layer/Al configuration because of the breakdown of the devices under low voltage (<3 V), as shown in Fig. S5.

Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was tested to study the surface morphology of the P2/PC71BM and P3/PC71BM films. Fig. 7a and b show the AFM height images collected from the best devices prepared with P2 and P3 as the electron-donor materials. The root mean square (rms) roughness of the three blend films were 3.17 nm and 0.65 nm, respectively. The lower rms value of P3/PC71BM implied the better miscibility between P3 and PC71BM, which resulted from the weaker molecular aggregation of P3, as shown in the XRD data. The AFM phase images of the two films are displayed in Fig. 7c and d. It's known that the domain size should be on the order of exciton diffusion length, typically, tens of nanometers, to ensure the exciton reaches the donor/acceptor boundary for dissociation before it decays to ground state.P2/PC71BM and P3/PC71BM exhibited uniform phase separation with domain scale of 30–50 nm and 20–40 nm, which are both approaching the exciton diffusion length, and the small domains also produce a high donor/acceptor interface area, which is essential for the efficient exciton separation.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was tested to investigate the phase separation in the bulk-heterojunction film. As shown in Fig. 8, the bright regions can be attributed to the polymer domains, while the dark regions can be attributed to the PC71BM domains due to its high electron scattering density. The P2/PC71BM films exhibited domains with the sizes in the range of 30–50 nm (Fig. 8a), which is consistent with its AFM phase image. Otherwise, P3/PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 8b, displayed featured and optimum phase separation with smaller phase domain in the range of 20–40 nm, which agrees well with the exciton diffusion length. The smaller phase scale presumably resulted from the relatively weaker aggregation effect of 2-ethylhexylthienyl substituted BDT, as discussed in the XRD data. The optimized film morphology of P3/PC71BM is consistent with its enhanced hole mobility and photovoltaic performance.

We synthesized three wide band gap polymers P1, P2, and P3 containing phthalimide (PhI) as the electron-acceptor unit and 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy), 4,8-bis(n-dodecyloxy) or 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) benzodithiophene (BDT) as the electron-donor unit, respectively. All three polymers exhibited large optical band gaps of 2.07–2.13 eV. Optical tests found the wide band gap polymers P1–P3 displayed a film absorption peak at about 500 nm. Electrochemical tests indicated that the four polymers possess deeply layered HOMO energy levels (−5.36 eV to −5.57 eV). Except for the poorly soluble P1, P2 and P3 were applied to fabricate polymer solar cells (PSCs), respectively, with PC71BM as the electron-acceptor material. The photovoltaic tests indicated that the large band gap polymer P2, with 4,8-bis(n-dodecyloxy) BDT as the electron-donor unit, showed a relatively poor photovoltaic performances with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 3.43 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V, a fill factor (FF) of 54.7%, and a PCE of 1.50%. However, the large band gap polymer P3, with 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) BDT as the electron-donor unit, exhibited significantly increased PCE of 3.70%, with a nearly 2-fold increase of the short-circuit current density, Jsc (7.01 mA cm−2vs. 3.43 mA cm−2), an increased Voc (0.89 V vs. 0.80 V) and an improved FF (58.6% vs. 54.7%), respectively. The high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V and 0.89 V is consistent with their deep HOMOs (−5.36 vs. −5.57 eV). We attribute the promoted photovoltaic performances of P3 with respect to P2 to its broader absorption, deeper HOMO level, weaker aggregation effect, better miscibility with PC71BM, optimized film morphology, and finally, better hole mobility. Accordingly, our results suggest that small structural diversity was a proper way toward highly efficient wide band gap polymers, and also, enriched the tool-box for wide band gap polymers with enhanced efficiencies higher than 3.5%. The wide band gap polymer, P3, should be a potential candidate for application in tandem solar cells.


The 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer. FTIR spectra were recorded on a TENSOR-27 spectrometer using KBr pellets. Elemental analysis was performed on a flash EA1112 analyzer. The molecular weight of the polymers was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in THF using polystyrene as a standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. UV-vis absorption was recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 spectrometer. The electrochemical measurements were carried out in a deoxygenated solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in acetonitrile with a computer-controlled Zennium electrochemical workstation. A glassy carbon electrode, a Pt wire, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. AFM images were obtained from the PSC samples using a Nanoscope V AFM (Digital Instruments) in tapping mode. TEM tests were performed on a JEM-2011F operated at 200 kV. The TEM specimens were prepared by transferring the spin-coated films to the 200 mesh copper grids. X-ray diffraction (XRD) samples of pristine polymer films or polymer/PCBM blending films were prepared by drop-casting of solutions on silica slides. The XRD pattern was recorded by a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer operated at 40 kV voltage and a 200 mA current with Cu Kα radiation.


The polymer solar cell (PSC) devices were fabricated with the traditional configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/PCBM/Ca/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was precleaned with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol and treated in a Novascan PSD-ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 30 min. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass with spin-coating speed of 2000 rpm and baked at 150 °C for 10 min. A 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of polymer/PCBM (30 mg mL−1) subsequently spin-coated on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer (ca. 100 nm). Then, the Ca/Al cathode was deposited on the photoactive layer by vacuum evaporation (ca. 20/80 nm). The effective area of one cell is 6 mm2. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp with AM1.5 filter was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. EQE measurements were carried out on an oriel IQE 200 (Newport).


An n-type heavily doped Si wafer with a SiO2 layer of 300 nm (with a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2) served as the bottom gate electrode and dielectric layer, respectively. The bottom Au contacts were prepared by photolithography and the device channel lengths, defined as the distance between source and drain was 5 μm. The channel width was 1400 μm. Before deposition of the organic semiconductor, the gate dielectrics were treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 120 °C, forming an OTS self-assembled monolayer. The treated substrates were rinsed successively with heptane, ethanol, and chloroform. A polymer layer was deposited on the OTS-treated Si/SiO2 substrates by spin-coating of a chlorobenzene (CB) solution (10 mg mL−1). The resulting thin films were annealed at 80 °C for 60 minutes in a vacuum to dry the solvent and improve the film quality and morphology. The field-effect mobility was calculated in the saturation region using the following equation: Ids = (WCi/2L)μ(VG − VT)2, where Ids is the drain–source current, W and L are the channel width (1400 μm) and length (5 μm), respectively, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer (SiO2, 11 nF cm−2), VG and VT are the gate and threshold voltages, respectively.


The devices were fabricated with configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au. The active layers were spin-coated under the conditions that afford the best photovoltaic results. The following equation was applied to estimate the hole mobilities: ln(JL3V2) = 0.89(1/E0)0.5(V/L)0.5 + ln(9εε0μ0/8), where ε is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 the permittivity of the vacuum, μ0 the zero-field mobility, E0 the characteristic field, J the current density, L the thickness of the films, and V = Vappl − Vbi; Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode (in this device structure, Vbi = 0.2 V). The hole mobility of the blending films were deduced from the intercept value ln(9εε0μ0/8). Herein ε is 3, ε0 is 8.85419 × 10−12 CV−1 m−1.


All of the starting materials and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and were used without further purification, unless otherwise stated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl under nitrogen before use. The starting materials 1, 2, and 3 were purchased from Solarmer and 4 was synthesized according to the literature method.


The three copolymers, P1, P2, and P3 were synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction (Scheme 2). A typical procedure toward the four copolymers was as follows. The dibrominated monomer (4), distannyl monomer (1 or 2 or 3), and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (16 mol%) were dissolved in dry toluene and degassed with N2 for 10 min. Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (3 mol%) was added and the solution was degassed with N2 for another 10 min. The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 24 h under the N2 atmosphere. 2-Tributylstannylthiophene and 2-bromothiophene were added individually to the reaction solution to end-cap the copolymer. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was added dropwise into methanol. The precipitates were filtered and collected. The collected solid was then washed successively with acetone, hexane, and chloroform in Soxhlet apparatus, respectively. The final chloroform fraction was concentrated to 10 mL and then added dropwise to methanol (100 mL) and the precipitates were collected and dried under vacuum to afford the desired copolymers.
