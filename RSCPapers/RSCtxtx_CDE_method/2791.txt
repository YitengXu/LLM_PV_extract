Polymer/polymer blend solar cell with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) have been fabricated using a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly[2,7-(9,9′-octyl-fluorene)-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-bis(hexyloxy)-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PFDTBT-OC6) as the active layer. The influence of thermal annealing on the early time excited state dynamics, the morphology of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films and the resulting photovoltaic performance have been investigated in detail. The thermally annealed P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend solar cell demonstrates a power conversion efficiency of 1.80% with a VOC of 1.36 V, much higher than the as-cast solar cell (0.02%). Transient absorption experiments disclosed that thermal annealing does not show a significant influence on the early time excited state dynamics of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend. The severe geminate recombination of the charge pairs shortly after the charge transfer in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film still exists even if the blend film is subjected to thermal annealing, possibly due to the intrinsic donor/acceptor interfacial nature and the impure donor/acceptor phase separation. The enhanced photovoltaic performance after thermal annealing can be mainly attributed to the formation of interconnected networks of P3HT crystallites within the PFDTBT-OC6 matrix, which helps to improve the collection of photo-generated charges. The results implicate that restraining the dominant geminate recombination in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films is a key issue to boost the photovoltaic performance of polymer/polymer blend solar cells further.

Solution-processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential low-cost, light-weight and roll-to-roll processing on flexible substrates. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 8% has been achieved for polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), are currently the best electron acceptor materials in BHJ polymer solar cells. In addition to fullerene derivatives, organic/polymer electron acceptors have been developed in combination with polymer donors to fabricate polymer/polymer blend solar cells. Compared to the polymer/fullerene derivative blends, polymer/polymer blends possess some potential advantages. For example, in contrast to the low extinction coefficient of fullerene derivatives, polymer/polymer blends have the ability to tune the absorption profile and optical density of the active layer via chemical tailoring of the polymer donor and acceptor materials. Increasing the optical density and extending the spectral coverage of the active layer to the solar spectrum for efficient photon harvesting is becoming increasingly important to further boost the efficiency of polymer solar cells. Another issue for polymer/fullerene blends are their low open-circuit voltage (VOC) values due to the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of fullerene derivatives. It is well known that an offset between the LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor is required to provide a driving force for efficient exciton dissociation due to the large binding energies of the excitons in organic semiconductors. However, the VOC values of the BHJ polymer solar cells are mainly determined by the energy difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor. The high-efficiency OPVs based on fullerene derivatives generally have a large LUMO offset in the range of 0.6–1 eV due to the large electronegativity of fullerene. However this squeezes the VOC, and thus limits the PCEs. To minimize photon energy loss in the electron-transfer process and to increase the VOC of fullerene-based devices, many efforts have been devoted to developing new fullerene derivatives. For example, a novel fullerene derivative indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) shows a high LUMO level of −3.74 eV, resulting in a solar cell with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor material having a high VOC of 0.84 V and an increased PCE of 6.5%. Reported polymer/polymer blend solar cells with P3HT as the donor material can achieve a VOC as high as 1.26 V. Hence, semiconducting polymers with higher LUMO levels are promising candidates for electron acceptors as they may help to increase VOC in addition to enhancing the photon absorption. Very recently, encouraging results have been obtained where the LUMO level offset between the donor and acceptor can be as small as 0.12 eV for efficient charge transfers.

Herein, we demonstrate a polymer/polymer blend solar cell with P3HT as the electron donor and poly[2,7-(9,9′-octyl-fluorene)-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-bis(hexyloxy)-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PFDTBT-OC6) as the electron acceptor. This kind of polymer/polymer blend solar cell shows a VOC as high as 1.36 V owing to the high LUMO level (−3.22 eV) of the PFDTBT-OC6 acceptor, which is about 0.8 eV higher than that of the PCBM counterpart. The thermally annealed P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend solar cell demonstrates an overall PCE of 1.80%, much higher than the as-cast solar cell (0.02%). The influence of thermal annealing on the morphology, the early excited state dynamics and the resulting photovoltaic performance of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film have been investigated in detail. We found that thermal annealing does not show a significant influence on the early time excited state dynamics of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend compared to the as-cast blend, even though phase separation between P3HT and PFDTBT-OC6 is distinctly observed after thermal annealing. We reveal that the geminate recombination of charge pairs shortly after charge transfer dominates in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films even after thermal annealing. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of the annealed device is mainly due to the formation of interconnected networks of P3HT nanocrystallites within the PFDTBT-OC6 matrix, which helps to improve the collection of photo-generated free charges. If the geminate recombination can be better restrained, the photovoltaic performance of this kind of polymer/polymer blend solar cell will be improved further.

P3HT with a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 30000 and a regioregularity higher than 96% was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. and was used as received. PFDTBT-OC6 was synthesized according to a literature procedure. A 1H NMR spectrum of PFDTBT-OC6 was recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. Spectral data: δH 8.57 (s, 2H), 7.74 (d, 6H), 7.55 (d, 2H), 4.24 (s, 4H), 2.43–1.83 (m, 8H), 1.57 (s, 4H), 1.48–1.34 (m, 8H), 1.26–1.04 (m, 20H), 0.99–0.91 (m, 6H), 0.88–0.58 (m, 10H). The Mw and the polydispersity index are 263000 and 2.6, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). GPC analysis was conducted on a PL-GPC 220 system with polystyrene as the standard.


The polymer/polymer blend solar cells had a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6/LiF/Al. Poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P4083) was first spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO substrate (20 Ω square−1) to produce a 35 nm thick anode buffer layer. A solution containing a mixture of P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 (1:2, w/w) in chloroform was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to produce an active layer. The sample was then transferred into a vacuum evaporator and a cathode with a structure of LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) was thermally deposited on top of the active layer to produce an active area of 0.16 cm2 for each device. The electron-only device with a structure of Al/P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6/LiF/Al and the hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6/Au were also fabricated. Thermal annealing was carried out in a glove box at a range of temperatures for 10 min after the devices were completed. The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G simulated solar light illumination. The light intensity was determined by a calibrated silicon diode with a KG-5 visible color filter. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were measured under short-circuit conditions with a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research System) at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz during illumination with a monochromatic light from a Xenon lamp.


UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3100 UV-vis spectrophotometer on quartz substrates. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were taken on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer on quartz substrates. The optical bandgap (Eg) of the polymers was calculated according to the absorption onset of the UV-vis absorption spectra.


The femtosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements were performed at room temperature and the excitation spot was about 300 μm in diameter. The optical excitation wavelength was 450 nm for the samples and the details for the system setup can be found in the literature. The samples were encapsulated under a nitrogen atmosphere.


Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the blend films was conducted on a JEOL JEM-1011 TEM operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 KV. The thin active layers of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blends were taken from the solar cell devices directly. The samples were dipped into de-ionized water. The thin active layer uncovered by aluminum peeled off from the water-soluble PEDOT:PSS layer. Then the floating active layer was transferred onto a copper grid.


The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the blend films were obtained from a Bruker D8 Discover thin film diffractometer equipped with a copper target (Kα line, λ = 1.54056 Å) in a scattering angle range of 2θ (2–30 degrees). The P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films were deposited on a polished silicon wafer via spin-coating. The spin-coating conditions were the same as those used for the deposition of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend active layer in the device.


The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 using an He–I (21.2 eV) discharge lamp. For the UPS measurements, a sample bias of −8 V was applied in order to separate the secondary edge for the analyzer.


Fig. 1 presents the chemical structures of P3HT and PFDTDT-OC6, and the schematic energy level diagram of the polymer/polymer blend solar cells. P3HT is a commonly used donor material in BHJ polymer solar cells. PFDTBT-OC6 is a kind of polyfluorene copolymer. The hexyloxy side chain on the 2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole units not only provides PFDTBT-OC6 with good solubility, but also a more planar conformation. As shown in Fig. 1, the offset between the LUMO levels of P3HT and PFDTBT-OC6 is ca. 0.46 eV, and the offset between the HOMO levels is ca. 0.60 eV. Thus, both the electron transfer from P3HT to PFDTBT-OC6 and the hole transfer from PFDTBT-OC6 to P3HT can occur upon photoexcitation. The absorptions of P3HT, PFDTBT-OC6 and P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 (1:2, w/w) blend films are shown in Fig. 2(a). PFDTBT-OC6 exhibits a strong absorption between 300–600 nm with two peaks at 390 and 526 nm. The absorption of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend is a superimposition of the P3HT and PFDTBT-OC6 films. Fig. 2(b) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the P3HT, PFDTBT-OC6 and P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 (1:2, w/w) blend films. The PFDTBT-OC6 film exhibits a more efficient red emission compared to the P3HT film. After mixing with P3HT, the PL of PFDTBT-OC6 is quenched, implying that the photoinduced hole transfer from PFDTBT-OC6 to P3HT occurs based on the energy level diagram shown in Fig. 1. The PL intensity of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film increased after thermal annealing, possibly due to an increased phase separation with domain sizes beyond the exciton diffusion length.

The illuminated J–V characteristics of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 (1:2, w/w) polymer solar cells with thermal annealing at different temperatures and without thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the photovoltaic parameters of the cells are summarized in Table 1. With increasing annealing temperature, the short-circuit current (JSC) increases from 0.07 mA cm−2 for the as-cast cell to 2.22 mA cm−2 for the cell annealed at 150 °C and then decreases. The VOC was slightly reduced from 1.33 to 1.20 V when the photovoltaic cell was subjected to thermal annealing at 150 °C. The fill factor (FF) was gradually enhanced from 0.25 to 0.38–0.39 with thermal annealing at high temperatures (150–170 °C). When the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 active layer thickness was decreased from 100 to 80 nm, the resultant cell exhibited a JSC of 2.93 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.36 V and an FF of 0.45, leading to an overall PCE of 1.80%. Due to the similar absorption profiles for the cells with a 100 nm thick P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 active layer, the enhanced photovoltaic performance with thermal annealing at 150 °C may originate from the improved P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 morphology. This will be discussed later. When the active layer thickness was reduced to ca. 80 nm, both the JSC and FF values were further improved. As the series resistance was not distinctly reduced, the possible reasons for the enhancement may be attributed to two factors: (1) an optical field redistribution of the incident light within the active layer results in an enhanced optical absorption, and (2) a decreased bi-molecular recombination in the active layer results in an enhanced FF. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized cell is shown in Fig. 3(b). The cell exhibits a broad response at 350–600 nm with a maximum EQE of ca. 22%. The strong response at 350–450 nm should mainly originate from the PFDTBT-OC6 absorption, indicating that a hole transfer from PFDTBT-OC6 to P3HT occurs in addition to the electron transfer from the P3HT donor to the PFDTBT-OC6 acceptor. However, it is noted that the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 solar cells show S-kink illuminated J–V curves, which decrease the FF significantly. Generally, S-kinks are attributed to barriers at the electrode interfaces or imbalanced charge mobilities. To investigate the origin of the S-kinks, UPS measurements were carried out to detect the top surface component of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films. UPS is a surface-sensitive technology, which can only collect 1–2 nm depth information of the films. The low binding energy edge of the valence band of the polymer corresponds to the HOMO position. The measured HOMO levels of P3HT and PFDTBT-OC6 are −4.7 and −5.3 eV, respectively. The P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film shows a “HOMO” level of −4.6 eV, similar to that of the pure P3HT film. In agreement with the observation by Yana Vaynzof et al. in a P3HT:F8TBT blend film, a thin P3HT-enriched layer on top of the active layer exists. Generally a barrier is formed at the metal/semiconductor interface if the work function of the metal lies within the energy gap of the semiconductor. Due to a lower work function of the LiF/Al cathode compared to the LUMO of PFDTBT-OC6, an ohmic contact can form if the LiF/Al cathode comes into contact with PFDTBT-OC6. However, in our case, the top surface of the active layer is enriched with P3HT, which possesses a LUMO level of −2.7 eV, so the photogenerated electrons within the PFDTBT-OC6 domains cannot be collected efficiently by the LiF/Al cathode due to the P3HT at the cathode interfaces. Thus, electron accumulation occurs at the cathode interfaces, resulting in the S-kink J–V curves.

In the BHJ polymer solar cells, the formed excitons on the donor or acceptor upon photoexcitation undergo ultrafast charge transfers to form the bound hole–electron pairs (charge-transfer states) at the donor/acceptor interfaces with holes located on the donor and electrons on the acceptor. The bound electron–hole pairs either recombine or dissociate into free charge carriers to generate the photocurrent. The dissociation of bound electron–hole pairs is very crucial to obtaining a high PCE. As the recombination of bound electron–hole pairs occurs within nanoseconds, ultrafast spectroscopic techniques are powerful tools to study the photophysical processes occurring within the first few nanoseconds. Here, ultrafast pump-probe TA measurements were employed to investigate the formation and recombination processes of the charge-transfer states in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film with and without thermal annealing. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the TA spectra of the as-cast and thermally annealed P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films, respectively. The spectra from 450 to 630 nm represent the ground state bleaching and the stimulated emission of the blends, and the spectra from 630 to 850 nm represent the charge-transfer state absorption. Fig. 4(c) shows the early time recombination dynamics of the charge-transfer states in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blends between 100 femtoseconds (fs) and 1.2 nanoseconds (ns). The photo-induced absorption (PIA) signal at 830 nm corresponds to the absorption of charge-transfer states. It can be seen that both the as-cast and annealed films exhibit a two-stage decay process with an initially rapid decay within 100 picoseconds (ps), followed by a slow decay to almost 20% in the first 1 ns. The dynamics of the ground state bleaching are almost identical to the decay of the charge-transfer state absorption, indicating that a large fraction of the charge-transfer states recombine geminately. Thermal annealing did not show a significant influence on the early excited state dynamics of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film compared to the as-cast blend film. It is well known that a fast geminate recombination of a large fraction of charge-transfer states results in a large photocurrent loss in polymer solar cells. Many factors influence the geminate charge recombination, such as low dielectric constants of the organic semiconductors (typically between 2 and 4), an impure donor/acceptor phase separation, low charge mobilities, etc. Here, the morphological variance did not show an obvious effect on the early time dynamics of the charge-transfer states in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film, similar to the P3HT:F8TBT blend reported by Hodgkiss, whereas the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 photovoltaic cells exhibited a remarkable enhancement upon thermal annealing. It is inferred that the donor/acceptor network for the hole–electron transport in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend improved after thermal annealing. Well-connected individual pathways of the donors and acceptors are required to efficiently extract the photo-generated charges for BHJ polymer photovoltaic cells. The TEM images of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blends with and without thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 5. Thermal annealing is a widely used method to manipulate the active layer morphology. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the as-cast P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film shows a more homogenous morphology due to the good miscibility between P3HT and PFDTBT-OC6, indicating that a clear phase separation between P3HT and PFDTBT-OC6 was not formed. The corresponding XRD profile shown in Fig. 5(b) verifies that both P3HT and PFDTBT-OC6 are amorphous. When the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film was subjected to thermal annealing, needle-like nano-aggregates were presented in the resulting blend film, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The corresponding XRD result (Fig. 5(d)) verifies that the needle-like aggregates can be attributed to P3HT crystallization from the amorphous PFDTBT-OC6 matrix after thermal annealing. This result is consistent with the increased PL intensity of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film after thermal annealing as shown in Fig. 2(b). Although a limited PL quenching of PFDTBT-OC6 and a large phase separation in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend were observed after the blend film was subjected to thermal annealing, it is still not sure whether the amorphous matrix is pure PFDTBT-OC6 domains. Based on the analysis of early time dynamics, there exists severe geminate recombination of the charge-transfer states in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films. Only a small fraction of charge-transfer states are dissociated into long-lived free charges that can be extracted via the individual pathways by the respective electrodes. In the case of the thermally annealed devices, the hole-transport pathways are well constructed via inter-connected P3HT nanocrystallites within the amorphous PFDTBT-OC6 matrix. Thus, the interpenetrating pathways of the donors and acceptors account for the increased JSC and PCE values. This assumption is further supported by the J–V characteristics of the so-called single carrier devices based on the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blends shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the hole current in the thermally annealed P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film was higher by about 2 orders of magnitude compared to that for the as-cast blend film, due to the formation of crystalline P3HT networks. The electron current in the thermally annealed P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend film also increased at a low electric field compared to that for the as-cast blend film (Fig. 6(b)). This also helps to improve the charge collection at a low built-in field.

A kind of polymer/polymer blend solar cell with a VOC as high as 1.3 V was fabricated using a combination of P3HT (donor) and PFDTBT-OC6 (acceptor) as the active layer. The thermally annealed P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend solar cell demonstrates a PCE of 1.80%, much higher than the as-cast solar cell (0.02%). The thermal annealing effect on the early excited state dynamics, the film morphology and the charge-transport properties of the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blends were investigated. It revealed that thermal annealing did not show any significant effect on the ultrafast geminate recombination of the charge-transfer states at the donor/acceptor interfaces. The enhanced photovoltaic performance after thermal annealing is mainly attributed to the formation of interconnected networks of P3HT nanocrystallites within the PFDTBT-OC6 matrix, which helps to improve the charge extraction. The results implicate that geminate recombination is still dominant in the P3HT:PFDTBT-OC6 blend films and hence restraining geminate recombination is a key issue to further boosting the photovoltaic performance for this kind of polymer/polymer blend solar cell.
