Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention in the last two decades. Sequentially solution processed BHJ (s-BHJ) have been developed in recent years. s-BHJ not only maintain some advantages of mixed BHJ (m-BHJ), but also exhibit other advantages over m-BHJ. However, to date, s-BHJ OSCs exhibit relatively lower efficiency and have received much less attention compared with m-BHJ OSCs. Moreover, there have been rare systematic comparisons between m-BHJ and s-BHJ OSCs. In this work, we systematically compare the m-BHJ and s-BHJ OSCs based on a classical system PTB7-TH/PC71BM in terms of film morphology, domain size and purity, molecular orientation and aggregation, vertical phase separation, charge transport, efficiency and stability. The s-BHJ OSCs without additives exhibit efficiencies as high as 8.6%, which is similar to that of m-BHJ OSCs with additives (8.5%) and is the highest reported for s-BHJ OSCs. More importantly, the s-BHJ OSCs show much better device stability than the m-BHJ OSCs. This study demonstrates that employing s-BHJ is a promising strategy towards efficient and stable OSCs.

In the 21st century, developing renewable clean energy technologies has become the focus of research. In particular, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention because they have some advantages, such as low cost, light weight, flexibility, simple preparation, semi-transparency and large-area fabrication.

In 1995, Heeger and coworkers reported the first mixed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSC. The mixed BHJ (m-BHJ) is processed by solution and has some advantages: the ability to use thermally unstable materials; efficient exciton dissociation and photoinduced charge transfer at large D/A interfaces; relatively low energy consumption and low cost. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction m-BHJ OSCs is ca. 11%. However, m-BHJ OSCs also have some disadvantages, such as an indefinite D/A ratio in the active layer after spin-coating, difficult control of the morphology and insufficient device stability. For m-BHJ OSCs based on polymer donors and fullerene acceptors, high PCEs (>10%) were generally achieved by using high boiling point (BP) solvent additives: for example, poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]-thieno-[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7)/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM)-, poly[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene]3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl (PTB7-TH)/PC71BM-, poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD)/PC71BM- and poly[4,8-bis(5-(octylthio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-bis(trimethylstannane)-alt-(4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate)] (PBDT-TS1)/PC71BM-based OSCs. Although these solvent additives in the m-BHJ film increase the PCE, they decrease the device stability due to the metastable morphology of the active layer. For example, Kim et al. fabricated OSCs based on PTB7/PC71BM m-BHJ without or with 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). After being stored in air for 300 h, devices without or with 3% DIO preserved 61% and 39% of the original PCEs, respectively.
Sequentially processed bulk heterojunction (s-BHJ), i.e. layer-by-layer solution processed BHJ (subsequently spin-coated with donor and acceptor materials), has been developed in recent years. s-BHJ not only presents some advantages over m-BHJ (able to use thermally unstable materials, relatively low energy consumption and low lost), but also exhibits other advantages over m-BHJ (definite D/A ratio, efficient vertical phase separation). However, these successful examples remain rare and the best PCE of s-BHJ OSCs is only 7.59%. It's a challenge to achieve high-efficiency and high-stability s-BHJ OSCs. In particular, there have been rare systematic comparisons between m-BHJ and s-BHJ OSCs.
In this work, we systematically compare the m-BHJ and s-BHJ OSCs based on a classical system PTB7-TH/PC71BM (Fig. S1, ESI) in terms of film morphology, domain size and purity, molecular orientation and aggregation, vertical phase separation, charge transport, efficiency and stability. The best PCE of s-BHJ OSCs without solvent additive is 8.6%, similar to that of m-BHJ OSCs with solvent additive (8.5%), and is the highest reported for s-BHJ OSCs and the highest reported for PTB7-TH/PC71BM-based OSCs without solvent additives. More importantly, after continuous heating at 130 °C for 120 min, the PCE of s-BHJ OSCs is still as high as 8.4 ± 0.1%, while the PCE of m-BHJ OSCs sharply decreases to only 4.7 ± 0.1%, indicating that the s-BHJ OSCs exhibit much better device stability than the m-BHJ OSCs.

m-BHJ and s-BHJ OSCs with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/calcium (Ca)/aluminum (Al) were fabricated by spin coating. The active layer of m-BHJ OSCs consisted of a blend of PTB7-TH:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w), while the active layer of s-BHJ OSCs was fabricated by subsequent spin coating with PTB7-TH and PC71BM. For better readability, we simplify the device names (Fig. 1): m-BHJ-0 (blend without DIO); m-BHJ-1 (blend with DIO); m-BHJ-2 (blend with DIO after stability test); m-BHJ-3 (blend with DIO and pre-annealing); m-BHJ-4 (blend with DIO and pre-annealing after stability test); s-BHJ-1 (layer-by-layer); s-BHJ-2 (layer-by-layer after stability test); s-BHJ-3 (layer-by-layer with pre-annealing); s-BHJ-4 (layer-by-layer with pre-annealing after stability test). Fig. 2a and b show the J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of devices m-BHJ-0, m-BHJ-1 and s-BHJ-1 under the illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator, at 100 mW cm−2. For accelerated degradation, we heated the devices at 130 °C for 120 min. Stability curves of the devices under continuous heating are shown in Fig. 2c. Table 1 summarizes the device data based on m-BHJ films without or with 3% DIO and s-BHJ films before and after stability tests; the data were calculated from 25 individual devices.

Device m-BHJ-0 exhibits the best performance at a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.5 and an active layer thickness of 100 nm; the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE are 0.81 ± 0.01 V, 14.8 ± 0.2 mA cm−2, 60.7 ± 0.9% and 7.3 ± 0.1%, respectively. After the addition of 3% DIO, JSC, FF and PCE of device m-BHJ-1 increase to 15.8 ± 0.3 mA cm−2, 68.8 ± 1.0% and 8.3 ± 0.1%, respectively, but VOC decreases to 0.76 ± 0.01 V. The best PCE of device m-BHJ-1 is 8.5%. In the s-BHJ structure, since the solubility of PC71BM in dichloromethane (DCM) is less than 5 mg mL−1, the film quality of the second layer PC71BM processed with DCM is poor, and the average PCE is only 1.1% (Table S1, ESI). Therefore, we employed a mixture processing solvent consisting of 5% o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and 95% DCM to improve the solubility of PC71BM. The different DCB contents (3%, 5% and 7%) in mixed solvent have a slight influence on the performance of device s-BHJ-1. The thicknesses of donor and acceptor layers strongly affect the JSC and FF of device s-BHJ-1 (Table S1, ESI). The OSC with 80 nm donor layer and 50 nm acceptor layer exhibits the best performance; VOC, JSC, FF and PCE is 0.81 ± 0.01 V, 16.6 ± 0.2 mA cm−2, 62.7 ± 0.5% and 8.5 ± 0.1%, respectively. Compared with the m-BHJ devices, the s-BHJ devices yield lower FF but higher VOC and JSC. The best PCE of s-BHJ devices without solvent additive is 8.6%, which is similar to that of m-BHJ devices with solvent additive (8.5%) and is the highest reported for s-BHJ OSCs.
As shown in Fig. 2b, the trend for EQE is similar to that for JSC. The EQE in the range 450–800 nm is mainly attributed to PTB7-TH, while that below 450 nm is mainly contributed by PC71BM. In m-BHJ devices, the EQE in 450–800 nm is enhanced by the use of DIO. The EQE in 600–800 nm is further enhanced in the s-BHJ structure. The calculated JSC values obtained from the integration of the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum are close to the measured values (the average mismatch is 1.9%, Table 1).
As shown in Fig. 2c, s-BHJ-1 shows better stability than m-BHJ-1. The s-BHJ-1 yields a PCE of 5.1 ± 0.2% after heating at 130 °C for 120 min, preserving 60% of its original value. In contrast, the PCE of m-BHJ-1 decays to 3.6 ± 0.1% after heating at 130 °C for 120 min, preserving only 43% of its original value. The device stability of s-BHJ-1 is similar to that of m-BHJ-0 (preserving 63% of its original value) which is also processed without DIO (Fig. S2, ESI). Fig. S3 (ESI) shows stability curves of s-BHJ-3 with different pre-annealing temperatures: 80 °C and 100 °C give better device performance. After pre-annealing at 100 °C for 20 min, the PCE of s-BHJ device slightly decreases from 8.5 ± 0.1% to 8.3 ± 0.1%, but the device stability significantly increases. Compared with m-BHJ without pre-annealing (m-BHJ-1), m-BHJ with pre-annealing (m-BHJ-3) and s-BHJ without pre-annealing (s-BHJ-1), the pre-annealed device s-BHJ-3 shows excellent stability. The s-BHJ-3 yields a PCE of 8.4 ± 0.1% after heating at 130 °C for 120 min, preserving 100% of its original value. Without or with pre-annealing, the s-BHJ device shows better stability than the m-BHJ device.


Fig. 3 shows the energy filter transmission electron microscope (EF-TEM) images of m-BHJ and s-BHJ films of PTB7-TH: PC71BM without or with pre-annealing before and after the stability tests. s-BHJ-1 shows relatively dense polymer networks (the light part in EF-TEM) relative to m-BHJ-1. The polymer networks in s-BHJ-1 are clear and continuous; the width of these networks is about 10 nm. The polymer networks in pre-annealed s-BHJ do not change after the stability test (s-BHJ-3 and s-BHJ-4, the polymer networks are still dense and continuous), while the polymer networks in m-BHJ without pre-annealing (m-BHJ-1 and m-BHJ-2) and with pre-annealing (m-BHJ-3 and m-BHJ-4), and in s-BHJ without pre-annealing (s-BHJ-1 and s-BHJ-2) are not stable during continuous heating.

To examine the molecular arrangement of polymers and fullerenes in m-BHJ and s-BHJ films under different processing conditions, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed. The GIWAXS 2D patterns of m-BHJ and s-BHJ films are shown in Fig. 4. For all the samples, PTB7-TH shows a weak (100) peak at q near 0.3 Å−1 in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The fullerene aggregation peaks locate at q near 0.65, 1.3 and 1.95 Å−1. It is known that thermal annealing can induce fullerene crystallization/aggregation in the film, which is deleterious for the device performance. Therefore, we focus on the fullerene aggregation peaks in GIWAXS results. Compared with m-BHJ-1, m-BHJ-2 exhibits stronger fullerene aggregation peaks at 0.65, 1.3 and 1.95 Å−1, which is consistent with the most rapid device degradation rate, as shown in Fig. 2c. Relative to m-BHJ-3 and s-BHJ-1, the fullerene aggregation peaks in m-BHJ-4 and s-BHJ-2 are also enhanced, respectively, but to a lower extent. This suggests that pre-annealing and s-BHJ structure reduce device degradation rate. It's interesting to observe that from s-BHJ-3 to s-BHJ-4, the fullerene aggregation peaks are almost identical, which is responsible for the best stability of pre-annealed s-BHJ devices. To quantitatively describe the aggregation, the fullerene coherence length (CL) (extracted from the in-plane peaks near 1.95 Å−1) is calculated and listed in Table 1. Larger CL indicates stronger fullerene aggregation. The CL data are consistent with our qualitative analysis.
Domain size and average domain purity were probed by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS, Fig. 5). Profiles were acquired at 283 eV to avoid K-shell absorption, which can induce a fluorescence background and cause beam damage. In the m-BHJ structure, adding a solvent additive significantly reduces the median domain spacing from 70-90 nm (m-BHJ-0) to 30–40 nm (m-BHJ-1), which is similar to that in the previous report. In the s-BHJ-1 structure, the phase separation domain is close to the m-BHJ-0 structure. The average composition variation and relative average domain purity can also be revealed by R-SoXS via integration of the scattering profiles. Completely mixed domains result in no scattering over the q-range probed; a two-phase morphology with pure phases will yield maximum scattering. The relative domain purity of the films is 100%, 100%, and 82.5% for the m-BHJ-0, m-BHJ-1 and s-BHJ-1 films, respectively. The relative lower domain purity and bigger domains of s-BHJ-1 films can induce lower FF. Although s-BHJ film has big domains, the sufficiently mixed domains can yield enough distributed D/A interface and thus efficient charge transfer state generation.
The molecular orientation relative to the D/A interface is another important parameter in OSCs. To investigate molecular orientation in m-BHJ and s-BHJ films, polarized resonant soft X-ray scattering (P-SoXS) was employed. Fig. 5b shows the 2D P-SoXS scattering patterns and profiles with horizontally polarized X-rays at 285.8 eV for films processed by different methods. Scattering intensity in the vertical direction (perpendicular to the electric field direction) is more intense than in the horizontal direction (parallel to the electric field direction). This has been previously reported and interpreted as a polymer backbone orientated “face-on” at the interface of polymer/fullerene domains. More diverse intensity in these two directions means more ordered face-on orientation. We find in Fig. 5b that the s-BHJ-1 structure shows the highest diversity. To analyze the scattering anisotropy more quantitatively, we define an experimental scattering anisotropy parameter as the difference in sector scattering intensity (SSI) perpendicular and parallel to the electric field direction over their sum . The anisotropies for m-BHJ-1, m-BHJ-0 and s-BHJ-1 are 0.14, 0.17 and 0.19, respectively. This suggests that the s-BHJ film yields more ordered “face-on” orientation with respect to the D/A interface than the m-BHJ film. Such an orientation provides more electronic orbital overlap at the interface and will be beneficial to charge dissociation, resulting in higher JSC.

Under the best device conditions of m-BHJ-1 and s-BHJ-1 films, the s-BHJ-1 film exhibits much stronger absorption in the range of 550-750 nm than the m-BHJ-1 film (Fig. 6a), due to more donor content, which makes the s-BHJ device absorb more light and yield higher JSC. The photoluminescence (PL) of polymer donor PTB7-TH is quenched by a factor of >95% in s-BHJ and m-BHJ films of PTB7-TH:PC71BM (Fig. 6b). However, in the vacuum evaporated bilayer film formed by subsequently evaporating donor and acceptor materials, a sharp, well-defined interface leads to an increase in the PL quenching by a factor of 30–40%. According to the results of R-SoXS and P-SoXS, the s-BHJ structure yields sufficient mixed domains and more ordered “face-on” orientation with respect to the D/A interface of the active layer, which results in efficient exciton dissociation, photoinduced charge transfer at D/A interfaces and PL quenching.


In order to investigate the vertical phase separation of m-BHJ and s-BHJ structures, we used depth analysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to measure the ratio of atoms at different depths. Since both PTB7-TH and PC71BM contain oxygen (O) and only PTB7-TH contains fluorine (F), we attribute the O1s spectral line (∼530 eV) to PTB7-TH and PC71BM, and the F1s spectral line (∼684 eV) to PTB7-TH. One PTB7-TH repeat unit contains one F atom and two O atoms, while one PC71BM molecule contains two O atoms. We calculated the polymer weight content at different depths from the O/F ratio (ESI). The polymer weight content of m-BHJ-0 and m-BHJ-1 films (D/A = 1:1.5, 120 nm) and s-BHJ-1 film (120 nm) at different depths are calculated and listed in Table S2 (ESI) and shown in Fig. 7. In the m-BHJ-0 film, the polymer donor tends to aggregate on the top surface due to its relatively low surface energy compared with the fullerene acceptor. The weight content of the polymer is 62% at the top surface and 44% at the bottom surface, which is harmful for the extraction of charge carriers at the correct electrodes. After the addition of 3% DIO, the vertical phase separation of the active layer gets better: 46% polymer locates at the top surface and 56% at the bottom surface. In comparison with the m-BHJ-0 and m-BHJ-1 structures, the s-BHJ-1 structure has a higher PC71BM content in the top 20 nm and a higher polymer content in the bottom 20 nm. The PC71BM weight content is 92% (54% for m-BHJ-1, 38% for m-BHJ-0) on the top surface, while the polymer weight content is 82% (56% for m-BHJ-1, 44% for m-BHJ-0) on the bottom surface. Thus, compared with the m-BHJ structure without or with DIO, the s-BHJ structure has better vertical phase separation, which is beneficial to charge transportation and charge collection at the correct electrodes, resulting in higher JSC.


The hole and electron mobilities of PTB7-TH:PC71BM films with m-BHJ and s-BHJ structures were measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4, ESI). Hole-only and electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/gold (Au) for holes and Al/active layer/Al for electrons. The hole mobility and electron mobility were calculated from equations of the Mott–Gurney relationship (Table S3, ESI). The s-BHJ-1 devices exhibit higher hole mobility (8.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and similar electron mobility (2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared with m-BHJ-1 devices (μh = 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher hole mobilities of s-BHJ-1 devices are attributed to the relatively dense polymer networks and efficient vertical phase separation and are responsible for better device performance. The hole mobility of s-BHJ-3 devices slightly changes before and after the stability test (7.9 × 10−4vs. 8.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is consistent with good device stability; while the hole mobilities of m-BHJ-1, m-BHJ-3 and s-BHJ-1 films significantly decrease and thus decrease the JSC and FF of devices during continuous heating.


In summary, s-BHJ OSCs based on PTB7-TH/PC71BM were successfully fabricated without the use of a solvent additive. Compared with the m-BHJ OSCs with a solvent additive, the s-BHJ film exhibits stronger absorption, larger but mixed domains along with more ordered “face-on” molecular orientation near the D/A interface, higher hole mobility and efficient vertical phase separation for charge extraction, which play equally important roles in its better performance. As a result, the s-BHJ devices exhibit a PCE of 8.5 ± 0.1%, higher than that of the m-BHJ devices without DIO (7.3 ± 0.1%) and similar to that of the m-BHJ devices with DIO (8.3 ± 0.1%). The best PCE of the s-BHJ OSCs is 8.6%, which is the highest reported for s-BHJ OSCs. Moreover, the s-BHJ OSCs show much better device stability than the m-BHJ OSCs. Without pre-annealing, the s-BHJ device shows better stability than the m-BHJ device, while with pre-annealing, the s-BHJ device shows much better stability than the m-BHJ device. After continuous heating at 130 °C for 120 min, the PCE of pre-annealed s-BHJ OSCs is still as high as 8.4 ± 0.1%, while the PCE of pre-annealed m-BHJ OSCs sharply decreases to only 4.7 ± 0.1%. The pre-annealed s-BHJ structure can keep stable polymer networks and hole mobility, and suppress the excessive aggregation of PC71BM during continuous heating. Our results demonstrate that sequentially processed bulk heterojunction is a promising strategy towards efficient and stable OSCs.


Unless stated otherwise, solvents and chemicals were obtained commercially and used without further purification. PTB7-TH (MW = 124 kDa, PDI = 1.7) and PC71BM (purity >99.0%) were purchased from One-Materials Inc. and American Dye Inc., respectively. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO), dichloromethane (DCM) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were obtained from J&K Chemical Inc. m-BHJ or s-BHJ organic solar cells were fabricated with the structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) /PTB7-TH:PC71BM/calcium (Ca)/aluminum (Al). The ITO glass (sheet resistance = 10 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. A thin layer (35 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 20 min. For m-BHJ devices: PTB7-TH (10 mg mL−1) and PC71BM (15 mg mL−1) in DCB without or with 3% DIO was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form an active layer; pre-annealing was used after the spin-coating of the active layer. For s-BHJ devices: PTB7-TH in DCB (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a donor layer; PC71BM in DCM (6 or 10 mg mL−1) with 3–7% DCB was subsequently spin-coated on the donor layer; pre-annealing was used after the spin-coating of the acceptor layer. The thicknesses of the active layers ranged from 80 to 140 nm, as measured by an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A Ca (ca. 20 nm) and Al layer (ca. 80 nm) was then evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured using a computer-controlled B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit (Agilent Technologies) without a mask. An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photo beam size) coupled with AM 1.5G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The EQE spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.


Stability tests of the solar cells were carried out under continuous heating at 130 °C and the J–V was measured using a B2912A source meter every 15 min in 120 min under AM 1.5 G illumination. These tests were carried out in a glove box. Thin-film (on quartz substrate) UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Thin-film (on quartz substrate) emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorophotometer. The energy filter transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) characterization was carried out on Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN. The samples for the EF-TEM measurements were prepared as follows: The active layer films were spin-cast on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates, and the substrates with the active layers were submerged in deionized water to make the active layers float onto the air–water interface. Then, the floated films were picked up on unsupported 200 mesh copper grids for the EF-TEM measurements. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) transmission measurements were performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, USA. Samples for R-SoXS measurements were prepared on a PEDOT:PSS modified glass/ITO substrate under the same conditions as those used for device fabrication, and then transferred by floating in water to a 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane (Norcada Inc.). Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, USA. GIWAXS samples were prepared on Si substrates. The incident angle was 0.14°, which maximized the scattering intensity from the samples. The scattered X-rays were detected by using a Dectris Pilatus 2 M photon counting detector. Hole-only or electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au for holes and Al/active layer/Al for electrons. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi using 200 W monochromated Al Kα radiation. The 500 μm X-ray spot was used for XPS analysis. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was about 3 × 10−10 mbar. Typically, the hydrocarbon C1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon was used for energy reference. Depth profiling experiments were performed using an Ar+ sputtering gun operated at 500 V, rastering a 1.5 × 1.5 mm2 area with 240 s etch delays.
