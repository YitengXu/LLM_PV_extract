We extend thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and naphthalene cores in our previously reported fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) F6IC and IHIC2 to benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene and naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene, respectively, and synthesize two new isomeric FREAs BTIC and NTIC. Both BTIC and NTIC exhibit strong absorption from 500 to 800 nm with high extinction coefficients (2.4–2.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and electron mobilities of 1.8–3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Paired with the polymer donor PM6, the BTIC and NTIC-based organic solar cells (OSCs) show power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.5–12.2%, much higher than those of the control devices based on IHIC2 and F6IC (7.21–7.31%). The PM6/NTIC-based OSCs afford a higher PCE of 12.2% than PM6/BTIC-based OSCs (11.5%), due to the red-shifted absorption and up-shifted HOMO of NTIC.

Low-cost solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received unprecedented attention in the past decade due to their advantages of light weight, easy processing, mechanical flexibility and semitransparency. Compared with fullerene derivatives, nonfullerene acceptors present several advantages, for example, easy synthesis, tunable molecular energy levels and enhanced optical absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions.

In 2015, we reported the first fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA), 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC). The molecular structure of a FREA is generally composed of three building blocks, electron-donating planar fused-ring cores, side chains and strong electron-withdrawing end groups. In recent 4 years, thanks to the great advance in chemical structure tailoring for the ITIC family, FREA-based single-junction OSCs have realized power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 15%.
Recently, we reported two FREAs, IHIC2  and F6IC, with a fused hexacyclic core based on naphthalene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, respectively (Fig. 1). Compared with IHIC2 bearing naphthalene, F6IC bearing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene exhibits a red-shifted absorption of 118 nm, benefiting short-circuit current density (JSC). On the other hand, IHIC2 exhibits 0.16 eV up-shift of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) relative to F6IC, benefiting open-circuit voltage (VOC).
Herein, we combine naphthalene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to take advantages of IHIC2 and F6IC, extend the fused-ring cores, and design and synthesize two new isomeric FREAs, BTIC and NTIC (Fig. 1). The core of BTIC is benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene fused with diarylcyclopentadienylthiophene, while that of NTIC is naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene fused with diarylcyclopentadienylthiophene. The two isomers have the same side chains (4-hexylphenyl) and the same end groups (3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone (2FIC)). Comparison of NTIC and BTIC shows that NTIC exhibits red-shifted and broader absorption and a higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), while BTIC displays higher electron mobility (μe). Paired with the mid-bandgap polymer donor PM6, the BTIC and NTIC-based OSCs show PCEs of 11.5–12.2%, much higher than those of the control devices based on IHIC2 and F6IC (7.21–7.31%); the OSCs based on NTIC show a champion PCE of 12.2%, outperforming the BTIC-based devices (11.5%).

The synthetic routes to BTIC and NTIC are illustrated in Scheme S1. The chemical structures of the intermediates and final products were fully characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), and elemental analysis (see the ESI).

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted on BTIC and NTIC at the B3LYP/6-31G* level to investigate their molecular geometries and electronic properties (Fig. S1). Isomerization hardly affects the geometries but slightly influences the energy levels. The molecular backbones of both molecules exhibit a planar configuration, which is beneficial for intermolecular π–π stacking and electron transport. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BTIC are −5.62 eV and −3.40 eV, respectively, while NTIC shows a higher HOMO level of −5.56 eV and a lower LUMO level of −3.42 eV.
BTIC and NTIC are readily soluble in common organic solvents at room temperature, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, etc. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2) shows that BTIC and NTIC possess decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 362 and 397 °C in nitrogen, respectively (Table 1), indicating good thermal stability.

The normalized absorption spectra of BTIC and NTIC in chloroform solution (10−6 M) and in thin film are shown in Fig. S3 and 2a, respectively. BTIC and NTIC exhibit strong absorption ranging from 500 to 750 nm in solution with high molar extinction coefficients of 2.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 655 nm and 2.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 687 nm, respectively. The absorption maxima of BTIC and NTIC films are located at 710 and 737 nm, respectively, 55 and 50 nm red-shifted relative to those in solution, respectively, suggesting strong molecular aggregation in their films. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of BTIC and NTIC is 1.62 and 1.55 eV, respectively, calculated from the absorption edge of the thin films (Table 1). NTIC exhibits red-shifted and broader absorption and smaller optical bandgap relative to BTIC.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BTIC and NTIC are estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, obtained by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S4). Compared with BTIC (HOMO = −5.60 eV; LUMO = −3.82 eV), NTIC exhibits a higher HOMO of −5.56 eV and a similar LUMO of −3.83 eV (Fig. 2b). The trend of energy levels estimated from CV resembles the DFT calculations. The electron mobilities of BTIC and NTIC are 3.4 × 10−4 and 1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table S3), measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5).

The mid-bandgap polymer donor PM6  (Fig. 1) displays strong absorption ranging from 300 to 700 nm, which complements that of BTIC and NTIC very well (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC pairs show a small ΔEHOMO of 0.10 and 0.06 eV (Fig. 2b), respectively, which is beneficial for reducing the energy loss during the exciton dissociation and realizing higher VOC in OSCs. PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC blends exhibit a ΔELUMO of 0.21 and 0.22 eV, respectively, providing adequate driving force for charge separation. Thus, we adopted the inverted device architecture consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass/ZnO/PM6:BTIC or NTIC/MoOx/Ag to fabricate BHJ OSCs. The as-cast devices based on PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC show the best performance at a donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1/1 (Table S1). To optimize the morphologies of PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC blend films and enhance the device performance, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive was employed when the D/A weight ratio is 1/1, and the optimized DIO content in chloroform is 0.2% (v/v) (Table S2). The best OSC based on PM6/NTIC shows a VOC of 0.941 V, JSC of 18.0 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 71.6%, and PCE of 12.2%. The best OSC based on PM6/BTIC shows a VOC of 0.962 V, JSC of 16.6 mA cm−2, FF of 71.9%, and PCE of 11.5% (Fig. 3a and Table 2). The slightly higher VOC of PM6/BTIC is related to the slightly higher LUMO of BTIC. The main difference between PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC-based OSCs is JSC; the higher JSC of PM6/NTIC-based OSCs is attributed to the red-shifted absorption of NTIC, which is confirmed by the broader external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the PM6/NTIC-based OSCs (Fig. 3b). The JSC of PM6/NTIC-based OSCs calculated from integration of EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum is 18.0 mA cm−2, higher than that of PM6/BTIC-based devices (16.7 mA cm−2), which is almost the same as the JSC measured from J–V curves.

For comparison, PM6/IHIC2- and PM6/F6IC-based control devices were also fabricated and characterized. The PM6/IHIC2-based devices exhibit a VOC of 0.915 V, JSC of 10.9 mA cm−2, FF of 72.3%, and PCE of 7.21% (Table 2). The PM6/F6IC-based devices exhibit a VOC of 0.682 V, JSC of 16.9 mA cm−2, FF of 63.5%, and PCE of 7.31%. The PM6/IHIC2-based devices yield much higher VOC and FF, while the PM6/F6IC-based devices yield much higher JSC. The higher VOC of PM6/IHIC2 is related to the higher LUMO of IHIC2, while the higher JSC of PM6/F6IC-based OSCs is related to the red-shifted absorption of F6IC, which is confirmed by the broader EQE spectrum of the PM6/F6IC-based OSCs (Fig. S6). The PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC-based OSCs combine advantages of PM6/IHIC2 and PM6/F6IC-based OSCs together and exhibit high VOC, JSC and FF, leading to high PCE.
We investigated the initial thermal stability of the optimized PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC OSCs under continuous heating at 80 °C. After heating at 80 °C for 60 min, the PCEs of PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC OSCs decrease by ca. 7% and 13%, respectively, and then remain almost stable (Fig. S7).
We plotted the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of OSCs to study charge generation, dissociation and extraction properties (Fig. 3c). Jph reaches saturation when Veff > 2 V, suggesting that all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes, and the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) is only limited by the absorbed incident photons; thus JSC/Jsat characterizes the charge extraction under short-circuit conditions. The JSC/Jsat for the optimized PM6/BTIC- and PM6/NTIC-based devices is calculated to be 91.6% and 90.5%, respectively, indicating efficient charge extraction in both devices.
In addition, we also measured JSC under illumination with different incident light intensities (Plight) to study charge recombination behavior in the active layers. The relationship between JSC and Plight is described by JSC ∝ Plightα. The α values of PM6/BTIC- and PM6/NTIC-based optimized OSCs are 0.982 and 0.987 (Fig. 3d), respectively, suggesting negligible bimolecular charge recombination in these OSCs.
The charge transport properties of the optimized PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC blends were measured using the SCLC method (Fig. S8 and Table S3). The PM6/BTIC blend film exhibits a hole mobility (μh) of 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 5.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 0.84, while the PM6/NTIC blend film exhibits a μh of 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 6.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 0.51. Both PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC blends exhibit similar and balanced mobility values, consistent with similar FFs.
The energy of the charge transfer (CT) state was measured using highly sensitive Fourier-Transform Photocurrent Spectroscopy (FTPS). We do not observe extra features in the low energy part of the FTPS spectra, implying that CT state absorption is very close to the absorption of the pure D/A material. This agrees well with our energy level analysis which suggests that the HOMO energies of the donor and acceptor materials are very similar. To determine the CT energy (ECT) of the material system with a small difference between the singlet and CT state, electroluminescence spectroscopic measurements were performed. We find that the ECT of the BTIC-based OSC is 1.66 eV, 0.05 eV higher than that of the NTIC-based OSC (Fig. S9). However, the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) results suggest that non-radiative recombination voltage loss (Vnr) in the BTIC-based device is 0.05 eV higher than that in the NTIC-based device (Fig. S10). Therefore, the VOC of the BTIC-based OSC is only slightly higher than that of the NTIC-based OSC.

The surface morphology of the optimized PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC blend films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S11); both films display a smooth surface with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.30 and 1.21 nm, respectively. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to study the molecular packing information in the thin films. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding intensity profiles in the out-of-plane (qz) and the in-plane (qr) directions of PM6, BTIC and NTIC pure films and PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC blend films are presented in Fig. S12 and 4, respectively. Both BTIC and NTIC pure films show preferential “face-on” oriented scattering features with the π–π peak located at qz = 1.77 Å−1 (d = 0.355 nm) and the lamellar peak at qr = 0.310 Å−1 (d = 2.03 nm) (Fig. S12). PM6 shows a strong lamellar peak (qz = 0.32 Å−1; d = 2.03 nm) and a weak π–π peak at qz = 1.73 Å−1 (d = 0.363 nm) in the out-of-plane direction and a weak lamellar peak (qr = 0.29 Å−1; d = 2.17 nm) in the in-plane direction, implying that it has bimodal packing with the edge-on orientation preferred. For PM6/BTIC and PM6/NTIC blend films, the lamellar peaks in the in-plane direction appear at qr = 0.280 Å−1 (d = 2.24 nm) and qr = 0.290 Å−1 (d = 2.17 nm), while those in the out-of-plane direction appear at qz = 0.300 Å−1 (d = 2.09 nm) and qz = 0.310 Å−1 (d = 2.03 nm), respectively. The π–π peaks of both the blend films appear broad and weak in the out-of-plane direction at qz = 1.73 Å−1 (d = 0.363 nm), which can be attributed to the crystalline domains of PM6 and acceptors. This suggests that the face-on ordering of PM6 is slightly enhanced in the blend films.


We extend naphthalene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene cores in IHIC2 and F6IC to naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene and benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene, respectively, and design and synthesize two new isomeric FREAs, NTIC and BTIC, to take advantages of both IHIC2 and F6IC. Indeed, NTIC and BTIC combine the high LUMO of IHIC2 and red-shifted absorption of F6IC together and have a high LUMO of −3.82 to −3.83 eV and strong absorption from 500 to 800 nm. The absorption spectrum of NTIC red-shifts by 30 nm relative to that of BTIC. Finally, paired with the polymer donor PM6, the BTIC and NTIC-based OSCs show PCEs of 11.5–12.2%, much higher than those of the control devices based on IHIC2 and F6IC (7.21–7.31%). The PM6/NTIC-based OSCs afford a higher PCE of 12.2% than PM6/BTIC-based OSCs (11.5%), due to the red-shifted absorption of NTIC, demonstrating that the isomerization strategy can effectively fine-tune the properties and performance of FREAs.
