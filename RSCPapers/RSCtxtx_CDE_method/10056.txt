Electron-deficient end groups (EGs) are very important for non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) to tune their absorption, energy levels, and crystallization properties. Herein, we designed and synthesized three SMAs, namely, BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M by adding the methyl unit into 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN). Methyl group, with its slight electron-donating ability, significantly elevates the LUMO energy levels but does not seriously affect the bandgaps of the CPTCN-based SMAs, which helps to reduce the energy loss (Eloss). In-depth dynamic theoretical simulations of the donor–acceptor (D–A) complex reveal that the exciton bonding energy (BE) can be fine-tuned by continuously increasing the methyl groups on the end groups of the SMAs. Methyl-substituted EG reduces the driving force and also enhances the BE of the charge transport (CT) state exciton, leading to a decrease in the exciton dissociation efficiencies. However, we found that one methyl-functionalized CPTCN enables PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M-based organic solar cells (OSCs) to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.15%. Though PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M-based OSCs exhibit a slightly lower exciton dissociation efficiency than those of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M, a more favorable superficial and internal morphology is attained in the PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M bulk-heterojunction layer, which balances the electron and hole mobilities and diminishes the bimolecular recombination. Comparatively, BTTIC-4M failed to realize a high performance owing to its adverse interactions with the polymer chain and the multiscale phase separation in the blend films. Actually, adjusting the number of methyl groups on the end group is done to compensate the current–voltage losses within the OSC devices with complicated contributions from absorption spectra, LUMO energy levels, exciton bonding energies, and morphologies.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) composed of donor and acceptor materials can be used to fabricate flexible and large-area devices using high-throughput solution processing method, making them a promising photovoltaic technology. The past two decades have witnessed a rapid growth in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs: from an initial PCE of less than 1% to a PCE of more than 12% in fullerene-based system today. The tremendous advances in the field of OSCs can be attributed to the innovations in photoactive materials, device optimization, and interface engineering. Emerging as a new dawn, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) featuring an electron-rich core end-capped with two electron-deficient groups, have caught a wide range of interests to make further PCE breakthroughs. The most representative example is 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC), which was first reported by the Zhan group. The merits of such kind of molecules lie in their modifiable structures, which have allowed precise optimization of the absorption spectra, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, and the crystallization/aggregation properties. In the past three years, research progresses have been so rapid that open-circuit voltage (VOC) of over 1 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 25 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 78%, and PCE of 14% (ref. 36, 51, 56 and 58) have been achieved separately in single-junction devices via judicious molecular design.

It is well known that the PCE of an OSC device is equal to the product of VOC, JSC, and FF, which means that the most straightforward way to improve the PCE is to increase these three parameters simultaneously. However, it is very challenging at the current stage because of the trade-off between VOC and JSC. Besides, although we can compensate the loss of VOC and JSC in one cell, it is still difficult to control the active-layer morphology to obtain a better FF. The methyl group as a weak electron-donating group with a small steric effect has been successfully introduced into the design of organic semiconductor materials. Theoretical calculations indicate that the LUMO level of the ITIC family is mainly determined by the end group. Therefore, replacing the hydrogen atom on the terminal group with a methyl weakens the electron-withdrawing ability of the end group and thereby increases the LUMO energy level of the whole acceptor molecule, leading to a smaller energy loss (Eloss) without strongly affecting the absorption. Furthermore, the LUMO energy level of the SMA can be finely adjusted by the number of the methyl groups. It is worth mentioning that methyl group reduces the reorganization energy between the packing fractions and thus effectively enhances the crystallinity, which helps to achieve a regular morphology and a high FF in the OSCs.
Taking the advantages of methyl group into consideration, we applied this methyl substitution strategy on 2-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN), which first reported by our group, has been proved as a powerful end group to construct efficient SMAs. For instance, ITCPTC as a CPTCN-based SMA realized a PCE of 12.3% when paired with PM6. Herein, we designed and synthesized three SMAs namely, BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M by stepwise methylation of CPTCN. As the number of methyl groups increased, the LUMO energy levels of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M were gradually elevated without excessive increase in the bandgap. When blended with a commercially available polymer PBDB-T, the BTTIC-2M-based OSCs gained a better performance than their BTTIC-0M and BTTIC-4M counterparts; a high PCE up to 13.15% was produced from a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 19.40 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.3%. The BTTIC-4M based OSCs exhibited a high VOC but very low JSC and FF. The BTTIC-0M based OSCs exhibited a moderate PCE of 11.87%. To further explore the effect of the methyl group on the device efficiency, we performed the dynamic theoretical simulations of the donor–acceptor (D–A) complex. We found that the methyl groups increase the charge transfer (CT) state energies and the bandgaps (electronic affinity (EA)–ionization potential (IP)) of the donor–acceptor (D–A) complex, thus causing an enhancement of bonding energies of the CT state excitons, especially for PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M, and thus seriously affect the exciton dissociation upon the D–A interface. Adding methyl groups can optimize the superficial and internal morphology of the blends to balance the carrier mobility and reduce bimolecular recombination. On the other hand, an excessive number of methyl groups cause multiple crystal phases and weaken the intermolecular π–π stacking, which significantly affect the carrier transport and bimolecular recombination, and thus result in lower JSC and FF in the OSCs. Finally, this work provides a high-performance EG and gains insights into the important roles of exciton BE and bulk-heterojunction morphology on the performance of OSCs.

The detailed synthetic procedures of the end groups and SMAs are shown in Scheme 1. The 3,4-dibromo compound of 2,5-dimethylthiophene (or 2-methylthiophene) first underwent a nucleophilic substitution reaction and was then hydrolyzed to give compound 3a (or 2a). One of the more general methods for synthesizing such active methylene compounds (CPTCN, CPTCN-M, and CPTCN-2M) is to convert the dicarboxylic compound (compound a) into an acid anhydride (compound b), and then react the anhydride with tert-butyl 3-oxobutanoate to obtain 4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophene-4,6(5H)-dione derivatives (compound c). CPTCN-2M (CPTCN or CPTCN-M) was yielded through a condensation reaction between 1,3-dimethyl-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophene-4,6(5H)-dione and malononitrile. Facile Knoevenagel condensation reactions between BTTDC-CHO and CPTCM, CPTCN-M, and CPTCN-2M were conducted to obtain BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M in high yields, respectively. The three SMAs were fully characterized by 1H/13C NMR and mass spectrometry (MS), and all of them show excellent solubility in commonly-used solvents, thus meeting the basic requirements for OSCs devices.


The UV-Vis absorption by BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M in chloroform solution, neat films, and blend films are shown in Fig. S1,1a and b, respectively. In the dilute chloroform solution (10−6 M−1), BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M exhibit wide absorption ranges with maximum absorption located at 727, 723, and 714 nm, and large molar extinction coefficients of 2.95 × 105, 2.33 × 105, and 2.20 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. As the number of methyl groups increase, the absorption spectra of these SMAs see a gradual blue shift, and the molar extinction coefficient decreases (Table 1). A large red shift of the absorption edge from solution to films and strong vibration shoulder peaks can be observed in film absorption, indicating intense intermolecular packing in these neat films. The absorption edges of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M neat films are estimated to be 842, 841, and 833 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.47, 1.47, and 1.49 eV, respectively. Interestingly, a special phenomenon occurred in the blend films where the absorption by the PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M blend displayed a very large blue shift of over 50 nm relative to that of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M blend, while the absorption by PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M was slightly blue-shifted compared with that of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M (Fig. 1b). We suspected that BTTIC-4M has interactions with the PBDB-T polymer chain due to the large spatial steric hindrance effect between the dicyano group and the ipsilateral methyl group in CPTCN-2M, disrupting the ordered packing of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M blend (this issue will be discussed below). Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were conducted to test the electrochemical properties of the three SMAs. From the CV plots, the LUMO/HOMO energy levels were measured to be −3.89/−5.62 eV for BTTIC-0M, −3.86/−5.60 eV for BTTIC-2M, and −3.79/−5.55 eV for BTTIC-4M. Adding two methyl groups in BTTIC-0M elevates its LUMO energy level by 0.03 eV without substantially narrowing its absorption range. Although the addition of four methyl groups in BTTIC-0M causes a blue shift of 9 nm (about 0.007 eV), the LUMO energy level is significantly promoted by 0.07 eV, which enhances the VOC and thus reduces the Eloss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVOC).

To gain a deep insight into the role of methyl, in-depth theoretical calculations on both the single and dimeric molecules of these SMAs were performed (Fig. 2). The long alkyl chains were simplified to methyl groups. The molecular geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/def2-SVP level by using ORCA 4.0 program with RIJCOSX approximation. Grimme's D3 dispersion correction with Becke–Johnson damping and Grimme's geometrical counterpoise correction (gCP) were used during the optimization. The wave functions were obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level by using the Gaussian09 program. The calculated LUMO/HOMO energy levels are −3.65/−5.74 eV for BTTIC-0M, −3.60/−5.71 eV for BTTIC-2M, and −3.51/−5.63 eV for BTTIC-4M, which are consistent with the CV results and suggest that the methyl group effectively promotes the LUMO energy levels of the SMAs. The dihedral angles between the end group and the core of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M are 1.1°, 0.5°, and 2.7°, respectively. BTTIC-2M exhibits better planarity than BTTIC-0M and BTTIC-4M, which is beneficial for π–π stacking and electron transport. The ipsilateral methyl and cyano groups in BTTIC-4M cause a large steric effect with an increase in the dihedral angle up to 40.7°, which is much greater than that of BTTIC-2M (0.6°). This larger steric hindrance is like a jaw that may provide a possibility for interaction with the polymer chain (Fig. 2). The optimal geometric configurations of the dimeric molecules of the three SMAs are displayed in Fig. 2. The dimeric molecules prefer an anti-parallel stacked form with the end groups as the main stacking units, which is conducive for the extension of the π–π stacking. The intermolecular interaction energies of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M dimers were calculated to be −37.5, −41.1, and −45.4 kcal mol−1, respectively. Adding the methyl groups can significantly reduce the molecular reorganization energy and thus promote a stronger tendency for intermolecular stacking. Although BTTIC-4M exhibits the lowest molecular binding energy, however, poor planarity of the whole molecular skeleton may affect the regularity of the intermolecular packing. Hence, BTTIC-2M possesses a better crystallization/aggregation tendency than that of BTTIC-0M or BTTIC-4M in their neat and blend films.

The ultrafast exciton dissociation provides a solid foundation for the organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology, which dominates over all other photophysical processes. It is generally acknowledged that the exciton dissociation is related to the exciton binding energy and the driving force provided by the energy offsets between the LUMO (and/or HOMO) of the donor and acceptor in the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface. To better understand the impact of the methyl group on this process, we simulated the D–A complexes via molecular dynamics to evaluate the exciton bonding energy of these SMAs. The repeating unit of PBDB-T stacks upon a half wing of the SMA with a benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) moiety on the central core of the SMA and a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) moiety on the end group of the SMA, in the optimal conformation of these D–A complexes. These D–A complexes have nearly the same bonding energy of about −56 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2), which offers an indirect evidence for the occurrence of interactions between BTTIC-4M and PBDB-T because the parallel stacking between the three SMAs and PBDB-T exhibits the same bonding energy. The relationships between the local state (LE) energy, charge transfer state (CT) energy, exciton binding energy (BE), electronic affinity (EA), and ionization potential (IP) of the D–A complex are depicted in Fig. 1d. The CT energies of the D–A complexes based on BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M were calculated to be 1.38, 1.40, and 1.46 eV, respectively. The EAs/IPs of the D–A complexes were −3.54/−5.46 eV for PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M, −3.51/−5.45 eV for PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M, and −3.44/−5.45 eV for PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M, corresponding to the bandgaps (EA–IP) of 1.92, 1.94, and 2.01 eV, respectively. Therefore, the exciton bonding energy of the CT states are 0.54, 0.54, and 0.55 eV for BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M based D–A complexes. Methylation adjusts the energy of the CT state, bandgap, and BE energy of the D–A complex at the interface. Excessive methylation (BTTIC-4M) significantly weakens the CT state and widens the bandgap, resulting in a larger exciton bonding energy. From the CV measurements, the values of ΔELUMO (EDLUMO − EALUMO)/ΔEHOMO (EDLUMO − EALUMO) are 0.36/0.29 eV for BTTIC-0M, 0.33/0.27 eV for BTTIC-2M, and 0.26/0.22 eV for BTTIC-4M. The PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M system exhibits a larger exciton binding energy of the CT state and the smaller energy offset than those of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M and PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M, resulting in its lower exciton dissociation efficiency than the latter two systems. In addition, we also calculated the local state energies of PBDB-T and the three SMAs in their D–A complex. The local state energies of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M are 1.59, 1.58, and 1.59 eV, corresponding to the exciton bonding energies of the SMAs of 0.33, 0.36, and 0.42 eV, respectively, while the exciton bonding energies of PBDB-T in different D–A complexes are negative values, indicating that the recombination of the excitons occurs mainly in the acceptor and not in the donor. In fact, regulating the amount of the methyl groups on the SMAs is done to balance the current–voltage loss in the OSCs.

To understand the methyl group's effects on the photovoltaic performance, we fabricated a series of OSCs devices with the conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-T:acceptor/zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac)/Al (Fig. 3a). The wide-bandgap polymer PBDB-T was selected as the donor due to its matching LUMO/HOMO energy levels and absorption spectrum with the three studied SMAs. The commercially available ZrAcac served as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL) for efficient charge extraction. Chloroform (CF) was chosen as the processing solvent considering its high volatility, which is helpful in the formation of good morphology of the OSCs. The optimal weight ratio of the donor and acceptor (D:A) was 1:1 with the total concentration of the blend solution being 16 mg mL−1. Moreover, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) addition and annealing treatment were essentially required. The detailed device fabrication processes are described in the ESI. The best-performing current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the three SMAs-based OSCs and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3b and c, and the key photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The OSCs based on PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M achieved the highest PCE of up to 13.15% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 19.39 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.3%, all of which are significantly higher than those of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M- (PCE of 11.87% with a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 19.95 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.9%) and PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M- (PCE of 9.60% with a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 15.67 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63.7%) based OSCs. Adding two methyl groups into the BTTIC-0M not only increases the VOC by 0.04 V but also slightly promotes the JSC and FF of the BTTIC-2M-based OSCs, which is because the methyl groups lift the LUMO level and also enhance the intermolecular packing, thus regulating the morphology of the active layer. Although PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M realized a higher VOC (obtaining a very low Eloss of 0.52 eV when paired with PBDB-T), the overall performance is poor due to the low JSC and FF. As predicted by the theoretical calculations, too many methyl groups (BTTIC-4M) on the end group will damage the planarity of the SMA and induce interaction with the polymer, causing poor morphology of the BHJ layer, and the improved exciton bonding energy will also reduce the exciton dissociation efficiency, which will significantly lower the JSC and FF (this part will be discussed in detail below). BTTIC-2M is actually a compromise between BTTIC-0M and BTTIC-4M in balancing the current–voltage losses and adjusting the microtopography, thus realizing three relatively balanced parameters in the applications of OSCs. In addition, the average values with the mean square errors calculated from 20 devices of PCEs are 11.50% ± 0.22%, 12.68% ± 0.31%, and 9.28% ± 0.17% for the PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M-, PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M-, and PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M-based OSCs, indicative of the great repeatability of the device fabrication. The long-term stability of the best-performing OSCs based on PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M was tested with the conventional devices packaged and placed in air, and the stability curve is shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the PCEs of OSCs based on PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M dropped fast in the first three days, and then the rate of decline slowed down. The OSCs can maintain 85.8% PCE after 5 days, 83.6% PCE after 10 days, 80.5% PCE after 15 days, and even 72.2% PCE after 30 days, relative to the original PCE (13.15%), thus indicating good device stability.

The charge transport behaviors of the three SMAs in their neat and blend films were investigated by fabricating the hole-only (with the structure of ITO/V2O5/active layer/V2O5/Al) and electron-only diodes (with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/ZrAcac/Al). By fitting the data using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S3), the electron mobilities of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M were estimated to be 6.73 × 10−4, 8.19 × 10−4, and 9.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, suggesting that the methyl groups favor the π–π stackings, which agrees well with the calculated BEs for their dimeric molecules. In the blend films (PBDB-T with a hole mobility of 1.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), the hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities are 6.21 × 10−4/3.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 6.91 × 10−4/4.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 8.05 × 10−4/3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, i.e., μh/μe of 1.69, 1.50, and 2.03 for the PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M, PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M, and PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M, respectively. The relatively balanced carrier mobility of PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M is beneficial to reduce the bimolecular recombination and achieve better JSC and FF in the OSCs.

For a further understanding, the exciton dissociation and charge extraction properties of the optimal OSCs were studied by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff). As shown in Fig. 3d, the Jph could quickly reach saturation (Jsat) at about 0.5 V. The Jsats for PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M-, PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M-, and PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M-based OSCs were found to be 19.82 mA cm−2, 20.43 mA cm−2, and 17.28 mA cm−2, respectively, indicating the largest maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) for PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M according to the equation Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. Generally, the probabilities of exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge extraction collection (Pcoll) of the OSCs can be evaluated by the ratios of Jph/Jsat at short circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively. The Pdisss and Pcolls are 95.6/85.0% for PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M, 94.9/85.2% for PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M, and 90.1/78.5% for PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M, respectively. The Pdiss of PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M is similar to that of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M and obviously greater than that of PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M, which is consistent with the calculated exciton BEs. In addition, we also measured the photocurrent (Jph) as a function of the light intensities (P) to understand the bimolecular recombination in the optimal OSCs based on the three SMAs. It can be clearly seen that the Jph has a high linear dependence on P, with the slopes (S) being 0.96, 0.97, and 0.90 for BTTIC-0M-, BTTIC-2M-, and BTTIC-4M-based OSCs (Fig. 3e). The more serious charge recombination in PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M-based OSCs may result from multiscale phase separation in the blend films, which accounts for the low FF and JSC of the BTTIC-4M-based OSCs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of wavelength is defined as the ratio of the collected photogenerated carriers and the number of the incident photons, and is determined by the product of the efficiencies of absorption (A), exciton diffusion (ED), charge separation (CS), charge transport (CT), and charge collection (CC), giving EQE = ηA × ηED × ηCS × ηCT × ηCC. As shown in Fig. 3c, the PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M-based OSCs show a slightly higher EQE than that of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M-based OSCs and a much higher EQE than that of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M-based OSCs. Although the ηCS and ηCC between BTTIC-0M and BTTIC-2M-based OSCs are similar, the BTTIC-2M-based OSCs still exhibit a higher EQE, indicating a higher ηED and ηCT in the BTTIC-2M-based OSCs than that in the BTTIC-0M-based OSCs (assuming the same ηA). Moreover, excessive methyl groups (BTTIC-4M) not only affect the ηCS and ηCC of the OSCs, but also reduce the ηED and ηCT owing to poor morphology. The EQE-integrated JSCs are 18.67 mA cm−2, 19.10 mA cm−2, and 15.20 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M-, PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M-, and PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M-based OSCs, which are consistent with the measured JSCs within an error of 2%.

Atomic force microscopic (AFM) measurements were carried out to study the surface morphology of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M neat and blend films, and the corresponding AFM height sensor images are shown in Fig. 4a–f. The neat films of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M all exhibit smooth and uniform morphology with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.45, 0.41, and 0.38 nm, respectively, indicating a good film-forming ability of the three SMAs. When PBDB-T was incorporated, the RMS roughnesses increased to 1.27, 1.37, and 4.11 nm, respectively. It can be clearly observed that a good phase separation and an interpenetrating nanofiber microstructure are formed and developed in the PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M and PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M blend films, which are beneficial to the effective processes of exciton dissociation and charge transport, thus enhancing the JSC and FF of the OSCs. A great RMS change from the BTTIC-4M neat film to the blend film reveals that the PBDB-T components may disrupt the ordered packing of BTTIC-4M and lead to a rough morphology. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) experiments were also performed to observe the domain size and purity of the three optimal active layers (Fig. 4g). A similar high domain purity and a moderate domain size (18 nm) appear in the PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M and PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M blend films, which are beneficial to reduce the bimolecular recombination for achieving large JSCs and high FFs in the OSCs. Interestingly, two different domain sizes, namely, a small-scale phase (20 nm) and a large-scale phase (56 nm) can be observed in the PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M blend film. The large-scale phase is very likely caused by the interaction between PBDB-T and BTTIC-4M, and the small-scale phase size is slightly bigger than those of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M and PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M. However, the non-uniform phase will significantly reduce the phase purity and the large-scale phase will hinder the exciton dissociation and increase the probability of recombination, which are responsible for the low JSC and FF of the BTTIC-4M based OSCs.

To gain insight into the inner intermolecular packing of the three SMAs in their neat and blend films, the grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was studied, and the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and corresponding in-plane and out-of-plane cut-line profiles are shown in Fig. 5. In neat films, BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M all exhibited intense (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction at about 1.74 Å−1 (d-spacing of 3.61 Å) and (100) diffraction peaks in the in-plane direction at about 0.29 Å−1 (d-spacing of 21.6 Å), corresponding to a face-on orientation. The coherence lengths (CL) calculated from the lamellar packing and π–π stacking peaks are 62.80/21.81 Å for the BTTIC-0M neat film, 69.78/23.79 Å for the BTTIC-2M neat film, and 69.01/25.53 Å for the BTTIC-4M neat film, which informs us that adding the methyl groups on the end groups can significantly enhance the packing properties of the SMAs. For the blend films, the face-on orientation does not change and the lamellar packing and π–π stacking were both enhanced. To better illustrate the role of the methyl groups, we isolated the signals of the donor and acceptor in the blend films and analyzed them separately. The CLs of the three SMAs in the blend films calculated from the in-plane and out-of-plane signals were 120.77/30.34 Å for BTTIC-0M, 165.26/41.59 Å for BTTIC-2M, and 120.77/36.30 Å for BTTIC-4M, respectively. It should be noted that the better CLs of the lamellar packing and π–π stacking of BTTIC-2M in the blend film are beneficial for the horizontal and vertical transport of the charges, resulting in a better electron mobility of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M blend films compared to those of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M and PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M blend films. According to the packing performance of the three SMAs in pure films, the CL of BTTIC-4M in the blend film should be larger than that of BTTIC-2M, but it is significantly smaller than that of BTTIC-2M, revealing that the PBDB-T breaks up the order of the molecule packing of BTTIC-4M. We also calculated the π–π stacking CLs of the polymer donor in different blend films, which were found to be 27.42 Å, 36.09 Å, and 63.43 Å for PBDB-T in BTTIC-0M-, BTTIC-2M-, and BTTIC-4M-based blends, respectively. The largely increased CLs of PBDB-T in the BTTIC-4M blend film, multi-ordered diffraction halo (Fig. 5f), and the significantly weakened π–π stacking (Fig. 5g) provide solid evidences for the interaction between PBDB-T and BTTIC-4M, thus forming a large-scale phase through a jaw-like structure of CPTCN-2M.

In conclusion, three SMAs, namely BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M were designed and synthesized by adding methyl groups to the end group of CPTCN. A basis effect that could be observed was that the LUMO levels of BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M, and BTTIC-4M were gradually elevated and the absorption spectra was gradually blue shifted with the increase in the methyl groups, which would lead to a promoted VOC and simultaneously, a reduced JSC in the OSCs. In-depth theoretical calculations of the dimeric molecules and the D–A complex revealed that the methyl groups can significantly reduce the intermolecular recombination energy but increase the interface exciton binding energy at the same time. Compared with BTTIC-0M, BTTIC-2M shows a higher LUMO level without sacrificing the absorption range. Although adding the methyl group slightly increases the exciton BE of the BTTIC-2M-based D–A complex and results in a slightly reduced exciton dissociation efficiency of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M blend film, the enhanced π–π stacking optimizes the BHJ morphology, helps to achieve a higher and more balanced carrier mobility, and smaller bimolecular recombination in the active layer than those of PBDB-T:BTTIC-0M, which leads to an enhancement of JSC and FF. Thus, the highest PCE over 13% is obtained for the OSC based on PBDB-T:BTTIC-2M. In BTTIC-4M, the ipsilateral methyl and cyano groups form a sterically hindered jaw that induces interactions between the polymer and BTTIC-4M, which lead to a significant absorption blue-shift over 50 nm and poor morphology (rough surface, different scale phase separation, and weakened π–π stacking) of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-4M blend film, thus resulting in the lowest JSC, FF, and PCE among the three OSCs. In general, by adjusting the number of methyl groups added to the SMAs, we compensated the current–voltage loss and optimized the BHJ morphology to achieve 13% efficiency in the OSCs.
