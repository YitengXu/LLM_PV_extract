An alkyl thiophene unit was employed for the first time as a side chain substituent on an asymmetric benzodithiophene (BDT) building block in the design of novel light-harvesting polymers. A new D–A type polymer (PBDTTh–DTffBT) based on alkylthienyl asymmetric BDT and the well-known 4,7-di(thiophen-2-ethylhexyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT) was synthesized through a palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. Efficient bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated by blending PBDTTh–DTffBT with PC71BM. The optimized PBDTTh–DTffBT-based photovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.87 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.06 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 70.4% and a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.22%. The PCE was higher than the polymers which have the same backbone structure but also have the 1D or 2D symmetric BDT unit. In addition, a PCE of 7.83% with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 13.62 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.2% was obtained for PBDTTh–DTffBT/ITIC, which is also impressive for non-fullerene PSCs. The results indicate that our design strategy of introducing an alkylthienyl unit as side chain to fabricate asymmetric BDT-based polymer is efficient in improving the photovoltaic performance.

Harvesting energy directly from sunlight using photovoltaic technology is increasingly recognized as one of the most important ways to address growing energy crisis using a renewable resource. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have already aroused great attention from both the academic and industrial communities in the last twenty years due to advantages such as easy processability over a large-area size via printing or roll-to-roll technologies, low-cost manufacturing, and compatibility with flexible substrates. Despite the many advantages of PSCs, low power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still a major impediment to real commercialization. Although remarkable progress has been achieved by optimization of the device architectures and development of ideal photovoltaic donor polymers and non-fullerene acceptors over the past decade, which have led to PCEs higher than 10%, further improvements are still needed for practical applications and mass production. Three key parameters to determine the PCE of a solar cell are the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The PCE is equal to the product of these three parameters divided by the input power. One of the most successful strategies to improve PCE is the development of new low band gap donor materials to maximize the VOC, JSC and FF.

In 2008, a benzodithiophene (BDT) unit was first used in the synthesis of photovoltaic polymers and became one of the most successful building blocks in the synthesis of highly efficient photovoltaic materials. In recent years, hundreds of photovoltaic polymers and small molecules have been developed using BDT or its analogues as building blocks. And PBDTDTBT has become one of the symbolic polymers. The PSCs based on PBDTDTBT:[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) have shown a moderate PCE of 3.85%.
There are two main strategies to focus on BDT to eventually improve the photovoltaic performance of PBDTDTBT. One is to introduce an alkoxyl group to replace the alkyl group of the BDT unit, and both alkyl and alkoxyl substituted BDT are classified as one-dimensional (1D) BDT. Alkoxyl substituted BDT based polymers have been reported by several groups. Their encouraging results showed that the polymers based on alkoxyl substituted BDT can show a close stacking distance and an ordered film microstructure, which would be beneficial for charge transportation and consequently JSC of the devices can be increased. For example, Jiang and co-workers synthesized a polymer by copolymerizing alkoxyl substituted BDT with fluorinated DTBT (Fig. 1, PBDTHDO–DTHBTff), which showed a PCE of 8.30% with a high JSC up to 15.38 mA cm−2 in a photovoltaic device. However, these high performance polymers based on alkoxyl substituted BDT did not exhibit sufficiently high VOC (0.74–0.80 V). The other method is to introduce an alkylaryl/alkoxylaryl to BDT to fabricate two-dimensional (2D) BDT. The properties of 2D BDT-based polymers have also been studied by several groups. It has been proven that the 2D structures also efficiently decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) values of the corresponding polymers, which would be beneficial for higher VOC. However, two symmetric aryl groups can affect the interchain packing of the polymer and may further vary the degrees of nanostructural order in a thin film, leading to a low JSC correlated with solar-cell efficiency. For example, Jiang and co-workers synthesized a polymer by copolymerizing alkylthienyl substituted 2D BDT with fluorinated DTBT (Fig. 1, PBDTTEH–DTEHBTff), which showed a PCE of 6.20% with a deep HOMO of −5.34 eV and a moderate JSC of 13.17 mA cm−2.
In our previous studies, asymmetric BDTs with alkoxyl-(1D) and phenyl-/naphthyl (2D) substituted groups as a donor building block for D–A low-bandgap polymers had been developed, which combined both the advantages of 1D and 2D BDTs and the PCE exceeded 9%. This is a new approach to design prospective donor materials for high performance PSCs employing the asymmetric BDTs. In this work, an alkyl thiophene ring was employed as a one side substituted group and was connected to the asymmetric BDT building block. We synthesized a new polymer (PBDTTh–DTffBT) using the well-known acceptor unit, 4,7-di(thiophen-2-ethylhexyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT). The structure of PBDTTh–DTffBT is shown in Fig. 1. The thermal stabilities and photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of PBDTTh–DTffBT were carefully investigated. The PBDTTh–DTffBT/PC71BM based PSC gave a promising PCE of 9.22% with a JSC of 15.06 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.87 V and an FF of 70.4%.

The synthetic routes to the alkyl thiophene substituted asymmetric BDT monomer and corresponding polymer PBDTTh–DTffBT are outlined in Fig. S1 (ESI), and the synthetic procedures are described in the ESI. The key intermediate, 8-hydroxy-8-(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4-one (1) was prepared using Grignard reagent. In order to improve the yield of 1, 1.5 equiv. of Grignard reagent was added and the reaction time was prolonged to 30 h. The BDT–DTBT-based backbone polymer was synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization, using a Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 catalytic system. Although the noncovalent attractive interactions between the strong polar fluorine atoms on the benzothiadiazole units and sulfur atoms in neighboring thiophene rings is not good for excellent solubility, PBDTTh–DTffBT can partially dissolve in hot chloroform and THF and completely in heated o-dichlorobenzene due to the branched alkyl side chains. The number-average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as the internal standard and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent. The Mn of PBDTTh–DTffBT was found to be 63.3 kDa. The thermal properties of the polymer were explored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S2. The polymer has good thermal stabilities with onset decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss at 348 °C. Obviously, the thermal stability of the polymer is good enough for their applications in PSC devices.


Conformational analysis as well as the determination of energies and distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of PBDTTh–DTffBT were performed by density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase. In this work, one repeating unit was chosen, and alkyl chains were simplified into methyl to reduce the calculation time. The energies and distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals of the polymer are shown in Fig. 2, as well as the energy of minimized conformational structures. The dihedral angles of the polymer in the main chain are relatively small, which can be attributed to the non-covalent attractive interactions between sulfur atoms in neighboring thiophene rings and strong polar fluorine atoms on the benzothiadiazole units. These small dihedral angles reflect good planarity, which is beneficial for charge transportation to afford higher JSC. In addition, the dihedral angles between the alkylthienyl units of the side chains and the BDT backbone are about 54°, and the high twisting is beneficial to improve the solubility. The dihedral angle is slightly smaller than those of asymmetric phenyl BDT-based polymers, reported by our group previously (57–59°), which is beneficial for higher JSC. From the distributions of electron density, the polymer shows a delocalized HOMO (−5.06 eV) that is equally distributed over both the donor and acceptor parts of the molecule. However, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, −2.76 eV) is significantly localized on the acceptor unit.


The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PBDTTh–DTffBT in dilute DCB solution and a thin film spin-coated on a glass substrate are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption profiles of PBDTTh–DTffBT were similar to those of asymmetric phenyl/naphthyl BDT-based polymers, reported by our group previously and traditional 1D or 2D BDT–DTBT polymers. The corresponding absorption data are summarized in Table 1. The main absorption peak of the solution was at 603 nm. This typical band can be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer interaction in the D–A system. The other band in short-wavelength near 420 nm can be assigned to the DTBT unit, which was often observed in DTBT containing conjugated polymers. In the solid state, the main absorption peak became broader and the red shift occurred toward longer wavelengths with maximum absorption peaks at 641 nm. The large red shift from solution to solid state means a more coplanar structure and stronger interchain π–π stacking in the solid state. The red shift of PBDTTh–DTffBT, asymmetric phenyl/naphthyl BDT-based polymers and traditional 1D or 2D BDT–DTBT polymers is summarized in Table 1. The red shift of traditional 2D BDT–DTBT backbone polymer PBDTTEH–DTEHBTff was 10 nm, smaller than those of asymmetric polymers (38–50 nm) or traditional 1D BDT–DTBT polymer PBDTHDO–DTHBTff (76 nm). This means the planarity of traditional 2D BDT–DTBT polymer PBDTTEH–DTEHBTff was worse than its asymmetric and 1D analogs, which can affect the interchain packing of the polymer and may further vary the degrees of nanostructural order in a thin film, leading to a low JSC correlated with solar-cell efficiency. And the situation was improved in asymmetric polymers and higher JSC could be expected. The optical band gap (Eoptg) of PBDTTh–DTffBT was calculated to be 1.76 eV from its onset absorption as a thin film.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of PBDTTh–DTffBT. A saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) was calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ system to be 4.41 eV in this work. As shown in Fig. 4a, the onset of the oxidation potential (Eoxon) of PBDTTh–DTffBT was observed at 0.96 V vs. SCE, corresponding to a HOMO level at −5.37 eV. The onset of the reduction potential (Eredon) of PBDTTh–DTffBT was observed at −0.94 V vs. SCE, corresponding to a LUMO level at −3.47 eV. Relevant data are summarized in Table 1. Energy level matching of donor and acceptor materials is an important factor to enhance the properties of PSCs, especially the VOC. The LUMO energy level of PBDTTh–DTffBT is higher-lying than those of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (−4.3 eV) and ITIC (−3.83 eV). The LUMO differences between PBDTTh–DTffBT and PC71BM, ITIC are bigger than 0.3 eV, and they are large enough to overcome the exciton binding energy and thus guarantee efficient exciton dissociation and transfer. When compared with the traditional 1D BDT–DTBT polymer (Table 1), the HOMO of asymmetric polymers and the 2D BDT–DTBT polymer were lower due to the introduction of aryl substituents, which have been confirmed by many groups. A higher VOC in PBDTTh–DTffBT-based PSCs can be expected, since VOC is proportional to the offset between the HOMO of polymeric donor and the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor.


In order to examine the photovoltaic properties of PBDTTh–DTffBT, bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTh–DTffBT:PC71BM/PFN-Br/Al, where PEDOT:PSS was used to facilitate hole extraction and PFN-Br was used for hole blocking and electron extraction. The blends of PBDTTh–DTffBT and PC71BM at different weight ratios of 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5 were used to optimize the device performance. The other conditions, such as the spin-coating speed, additive and annealing were also carefully optimized. The detailed optimized device performance is summarized in Tables 2 and S1 and the optimized current density vs. voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5. In the fullerene (PC71BM) system, the best device performance was obtained among the devices prepared using DCB as the processing solvent at a weight ratio of 1:2, with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 11.92 mA cm−2, a FF of 65.8%, and an overall PCE of 7.14%. So we chose the 1:2 weight ratio for further device optimization by addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and thermal annealing. When a 1% DIO additive was used to optimize the morphology, the device performance was slightly improved and it demonstrated a PCE of 7.64% with a VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 14.65 mA cm−2, and FF of 62.1%. And on this basis, when the active layer was annealed at 100 °C for 5 min, the VOC improved from 0.84 V to 0.87 V, the JSC improved slightly from 14.65 mA cm−2 to 15.06 mA cm−2 and the FF increased from 62.1% to 70.4%. As a result, the PCE improved to 9.22%. Alkylthienyl asymmetric BDT-based polymers show higher photovoltaic performance as compared to those polymers that have the same backbone structure but also comprise a 1D or 2D symmetric BDT unit. We can see from Table 2 that almost all the parameters of PBDTTh–DTffBT were higher than those of traditional 1D BDT–DTBT or 2D thienyl substituted BDT–DTBT polymers. The results indicate that our design strategy of introducing an alkylthienyl unit as a side chain to fabricate an asymmetric BDT-based polymer is efficient in improving the photovoltaic performance. The PCE (9.22%) of the PBDTTh–DTffBT-based device is one of the highest for fullerene-based PSCs reported in the literature. Meanwhile, for a non-fullerene (ITIC) system, the device based on PBDTTh–DTffBT exhibits a PCE of 7.83% with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 13.62 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.2%. The detailed optimized device performance is summarized in Table S2. The results demonstrate that the alkylthienyl asymmetric BDT is well suited for application to both fullerene and non-fullerene PCE devices.

The photoresponse of the solar cells was investigated by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE), and the EQE curves of the devices based on PBDTTh–DTffBT prepared with the optimal fabrication processes are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the PBDTTh–DTffBT exhibits a broad photoresponse from 340 to 710 nm in the PC71BM system. The EQE value of PBDTTh–DTffBT/PC71BM is very high in the whole spectrum and the maximum value reaches 90%, indicating that the device exhibits a good photoresponse over the absorption range. The PBDTTh–DTffBT shows a broader response of up to 780 nm in the ITIC system. The main absorption of an ITIC thin film is between about 600 and 750 nm. Thus, the EQE values of the blended film between about 500 and 600 nm depend on the absorption properties of PBDTTh–DTffBT. The integrated current densities from the EQE curves are 14.74 and 13.16 mA cm−2 for PBDTTh–DTffBT in the PC71BM and ITIC systems, respectively, which corroborate very well with the JSC obtained from the J–V measurements.
Charge-carrier mobility is another crucial factor for achieving high-efficiency devices. The hole mobility of PBDTTh–DTffBT was measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, using the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTh–DTffBT:PC71BM(or ITIC)/Au. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI), mobility measurements disclose a hole mobility of 3.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the optimized PBDTTh–DTffBT device in the PC71BM system and 3.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the ITIC system. These SCLC results are consistent with the PCE data of the polymers, where a higher μhole value is beneficial for higher JSC and FF.
In addition, the J–V curves of the optimal device based on PBDTTh–DTffBT/PC71BM under incident light intensity (ILP) were measured to give an in-depth insight into the charge recombination characteristics (Fig. 7a). Usually, the photocurrent (Jph) follows a power-law dependence on ILP, i.e. Jph ∝ ILPS, where S is a the power-law scaling exponent. There is very weak bimolecular recombination, so when the fitting slope value S is close to 1, the charge transports freely in active layers. As shown in Fig. 7b, the fitting slope S is 0.9969 in the optimal device, implying that the bimolecular recombination is almost fully suppressed and charge transport and extraction could be highly efficient. The J–V curves of the optimal device based on PBDTTh–DTffBT/ITIC under ILP are shown in Fig. S4, and the fitting slope S is 0.9958.

The surface morphologies and phase separation of the active layer could have an important effect on the charge generation and extraction. The morphological characteristics were explored by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM height and phase, and the TEM images of the blends are shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, the film exhibits weak aggregation, uniform phase separation and a smooth surface with root-mean-square (RMS) values around 1.87 nm (Fig. 8a) without thermal annealing or DIO, indicating the excellent miscibility between PBDTTh–DTffBT and PC71BM. The aggregation was enhanced and the surface became rough with a bigger RMS value of 3.74 nm (Fig. 8b) after the addition of 1% DIO, indicating noticeably enhanced aggregations. The AFM results revealed that the addition of DIO additive promoted the formation of an interpenetrating and interconnected phase separation morphology, which was consistent with their photovoltaic performance. As can be seen that the blend film was treated with 1% DIO and 100 °C for 5 min (Fig. 8c), the surface became smooth with a RMS value of 2.81 nm. As we know, AFM only provides the surface information on the active layer, and therefore, bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to explore the in-depth morphology and composition of the blend films, as shown in Fig. 8i–l. Compared with the as-cast film, the active layers treated with DIO or thermal annealing exhibit an obvious interpenetrating network structure, which would make the polymer easily mix with PC71BM ensuring better exciton dissociation and charge transport. The optimal PBDTTh–DTffBT/ITIC blend film was also characterized by AFM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 8(d, h and l). For the ITIC system, the optimal blend film exhibits an appropriate surface morphology and excellent phase separation, which facilitates the exciton dissociation and charge transport.


In conclusion, a novel alkylthienyl substituted 1D–2D asymmetric BDT as a donor building block was designed and synthesized. The new building block combined the advantages of both 1D and 2D symmetric BDTs, the alkoxyl group as one side chain on the BDT unit can improve the solubility and the morphology, while the alkylthiophene unit as the other side chain on the BDT unit extended the degree of conjugation and decreased the HOMO energy levels. A new D–A type polymer (PBDTTh–DTffBT) based on alkylthienyl 1D–2D asymmetric BDT and DTffBT was synthesized. PBDTTh–DTffBT exhibited good thermal stability until the decomposition temperature around 348 °C and showed a narrow Eoptg of 1.76 eV with a deep lying HOMO energy levels of −5.37 eV. The photovoltaic properties of PBDTTh–DTffBT were carefully optimized with different PBDTTh–DTffBT/PC71BM weight ratios, additive volume ratios and annealing. For the optimized blend, a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 15.06 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.4% were obtained, resulting in a high PCE of 9.22%. The photovoltaic properties of the polymer are improved in comparison with traditional 1D BDT–DTBT or 2D thienyl substituted BDT–DTBT polymers. And the PCE of 9.22% is one of the highest among the reported BDT and DTBT backbone photovoltaic polymers. In addition, a PCE of 7.83% with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 13.62 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.2% was obtained for PBDTTh–DTffBT/ITIC, which is also impressive for non-fullerene PSCs. Thus, this work further confirms the effectiveness and advantages of the symmetry breaking strategy, and meanwhile reveals a new alkyl thiophene substituent, which has the potential to obtain higher photovoltaic performance, and can be applied to other D–A light harvesting polymers to achieve excellent performance in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs.



1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600 (600 MHz). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were taken on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation as reported before. TGA measurement was performed using a STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere. GPC analysis was made using THF as the eluent. The EQE spectrum was obtained using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency measurement system. The morphologies of the films were characterized using a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400) and a transmission electron microscope (HITACHI H-7650).


Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on 15 mm × 15 mm patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM (or ITIC) blend (∼100 nm)/PFN-Br (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in acetone, methanol and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. The substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 6 min, then spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 4000 rpm, and annealed in an oven for 20 min at 160 °C. With the substrates transferred into a glovebox, the active layer (the optimal thickness of about 100 nm) with different polymer/PC71BM (or ITIC) ratios and treatment conditions was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer. The total concentration of the polymer/PC71BM (or ITIC) blending solution was 10 mg mL−1. Subsequently, an ultrathin layer of PFN (0.2 mg mL−1 in methanol) was cast on the active layer at 2600 rpm for 20 s. Finally, the Al (100 nm) metal electrode was thermally evaporated under about 4 × 10−4 Pa and the device area was 0.1 cm2 defined by a shadow mask. The photovoltaic performance was characterized under illumination with AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), and J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2420. The EQE of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.


All reagents and starting materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. All air and water sensitive reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. THF and toluene were distilled from sodium, with benzophenone as an indicator. 4,7-Bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT-Br) was synthesized according to previously reported methods.
