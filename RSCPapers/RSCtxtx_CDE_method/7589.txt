Amine-containing polyelectrolytes such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) are commonly used as cathode interfacial materials (CIMs); however, they are rarely found in non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) organic solar cells due to undesirable chemical reactions between PEI and NFAs. Unveiling the nature of these chemical interactions and developing chemically stable amine-containing polyelectrolytes is inevitable for achieving highly efficient and stable NFA organic solar cells. Herein, the reaction between PEI and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN)-based NFAs was investigated using a model system. 15N-isotope labeling experiments and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies revealed that the products were generated by the Michael addition reaction and existed as the keto–enol tautomers. Based on the identified undesirable reaction, we developed a series of functionalized PEIs that are compatible with INCN-based NFAs by protecting the reactive amine functional groups. Highly efficient and stable NFA organic solar cells were successfully fabricated by the use of functionalized PEIs with broad work function tunability and improved chemical stability, which led to NFA organic solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of over 15% and thermally stable device operation for more than 360 hours at 100 °C.

In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have become an important class of photoactive materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). The emergence of a benzothiadiazole (BT)-fused core unit such as dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole has led to monumental increases in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary and ternary single-junction solar cells. Apart from extensive research on outstanding photoactive materials and appropriate combinations of donor and acceptor materials, interfacial materials also play an important role in the improvement of PCE in non-fullerene OSCs. Inorganic interfacial materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO) are usually used owing to their high electron mobility and high visible-light transparency. Compared with the inorganic interfacial materials, the organic interfacial materials allow the modulation of the work function (WF) values of electrodes, which can be caused by a change in the interfacial dipole moment, and to enable low-temperature processing of flexible OSCs on top. In recent study, stable and ultraflexible OSCs were demonstrated with Zn2+ chelated polyethyleneimine. Nevertheless, despite these advantages of the organic interfacial materials, most of the high-performance OSCs have ZnO and metal ion chelated materials as cathode interfacial materials (CIMs). Therefore, the development of new organic CIMs for non-fullerene OSCs remains a significant challenge.

Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a representative organic CIM in OSCs owing to its strong dipole moment that reduces the non-ideal WF values of metal electrodes. Despite its excellent properties, PEI is not applicable to high efficiency NFA-based OSCs causing severe degradation of the device performance. This is because NFAs such as 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) can react with PEI. As shown in Fig. 1, there are two main mechanistic possibilities for the undesirable reaction: (i) 1,2-addition reaction on the carbonyl group and (ii) 1,4-addition (Michael) reaction. To develop stable and efficient PEIs, the exact reaction mechanism should be clarified with appropriate model compounds and a sufficient amount of experimental data.
There have been a few reports tackling the instability problem between a series of the PEIs and NFAs. Zhou and coworkers reported that polyethyleneimine-ethoxylated (PEIE) in an aqueous solution produces protonated ammonium groups, mitigating its reactivity to NFAs. Nevertheless, protonating PEIE has several drawbacks, such as difficulty in modulating the degree of protonation by water, suspicion of thermal stability with NFAs and limitations on the further development of new organic CIMs. There have also been a few reports regarding thermally stable organic CIMs. Most of the studies to enhance thermal stability have mainly focused on development of thermally stable active materials and optimization of the morphology of the active layer and device structures. Therefore, a more general approach to develop thermally stable PEIs has a potential strategy for stable and efficient NFSCs.
Herein, the reaction pathway of the PEIs in close contact with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN)-based NFAs is investigated using 15N-isotopic labeling experiments and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. Based on the results, we devised a strategy of protecting the reactive amine functional groups as well as modulating the dipole moment simultaneously. We synthesized a series of novel functionalized PEIs through the imine formation reaction with various functionalized aldehydes and the methylation reaction to mask primary and secondary amines of the PEI, respectively. After fundamental analyses of the new CIMs, the functionalized PEIs were applied to fullerene-based and NFA-based OSCs, achieving PCE values of up to 15.31%. Notably, our CIM-applied devices show better performances than those of ZnO-applied devices. To elucidate such excellent solar cell performances, the effect of our CIMs on solar cell operation was investigated. An effective modulation of the cathode WF generates a sufficiently high built-in electric field to extract photogenerated charge carriers efficiently and selectively with suppressed recombination. These outstanding functionalized PEIs also show a significant improvement in thermal stability, enabling highly stable operation of the device for more than 360 hours at 100 °C.

To elucidate the origin of the undesired reaction between the PEI and a representative INCN-based NFA, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-4F), we synthesized 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (T-2F) as a model compound for IT-4F. According to UV-VIS spectroscopy analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) data, N,N-diethylethylenediamine (DEDA) was selected as the model compound of PEI (detailed data and explanations are summarized in the ESI). Subsequently, we conducted the reaction between T-2F and DEDA and analyzed the products by NMR and mass spectrometry (see the ESI). Mass data of the major product suggest that the product could be originated from the nucleophilic addition of DEDA to T-2F (m/z = 439, [M–H+]). In Fig. 2, three plausible addition products are conjectured: 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group (P1), 1,4-addition to the acrylonitrile moiety (P2), and 1,4-addition to the carbonyl group (P3-keto and P3-enol). Through 13C/DEPT (Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer) NMR spectra, the CH/CH2/CH3 peaks of the product are discriminable (δ 127.0, 126.3, 125.5, 114.1, 111.1 and 60.1 ppm for CH, δ 54.5, 54.3 and 47.2 ppm for CH2, and δ 11.2 ppm for CH3). Note that CH peaks (δ 127.0, 126.3, 125.5, 114.1 and 111.1 ppm) can be assigned to C(sp2) from the thiophene and the INCN, whereas the CH2 peaks (δ 54.5, 54.3 and 47.2 ppm) and the CH3 peak (δ 11.2 ppm) can be assigned to C(sp3) from the DEDA. The probable structures of P1 and P2 cannot account for the CH peak at δ 60.1 ppm because the observed chemical shift (δ 60.1 ppm) is not matched for Ca (sp2) of P1 and P2. For more detailed structural analysis, we also performed 2D NMR experiments such as COSY (correlation spectroscopy), HMQC (heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence), and HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation). In the 1H–13C HMQC spectra, the chemical shifts at δ 127.0, 126.3 and 125.5 ppm belong to the thiophene, and the peaks at δ 114.1 and 111.1 ppm belong to the INCN. However, it is difficult to explain the 1H chemical shift at δ 5.70 ppm (this proton directly bonds to the carbon which has the chemical shift at δ 60.1 ppm) and the rather complicated splitting pattern at δ 4.10–2.30 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra. For this reason, 1H and COSY NMR experiments were carried out at −50 °C. The appearance of new chemical shifts at δ 11.78 and 5.78 ppm suggests the detection of hard-to-detect protons at room temperature due to the slow proton exchange rate. According to the COSY NMR spectra at −50 °C, the chemical shifts at δ 5.78 and 5.70 ppm are correlated with each other, which strongly supports the P3 structure (Fig. 2b and S29). Thus, the peak at δ 5.70 ppm is assigned to Ha of P3-keto in Fig. 2b. The new peak at δ 5.78 ppm in the low-temperature NMR spectra can be assigned to Hb of P3-keto, while the peak at δ 11.78 can be assigned to OH of P3-enol. Moreover, the 1H chemical shifts at δ 4.10–2.30 ppm (–CH2CH2– of the DEDA) might indicate the formation of the five-membered ring via intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which is probably why the NMR peaks from the –CH2CH2– of the DEDA are further split up. For more solid proof, the 15N-isotopic labeling experiments were conducted using 1H–15N HMBC NMR (Scheme S1 and Fig. 2b). According to the COSY, 1H–13C HMQC, 1H–13C HBQC, and 1H–15N HMBC NMR spectra, the chemical shifts at δ = 5.70 ppm and δ = 2.53–2.47 ppm should be Ha and Hc, respectively. To summarize, the Michael addition reaction occurs at the β-carbon of the carbonyl of T-2F, and the resulting P3 products seem to be in equilibrium at room temperature via keto–enol tautomerization (Fig. 2a).


To shed light on the molecular characteristics of our candidates, computational calculations were performed at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level as a feasibility study. For the optimized structures of the molecules, the electron density distribution with respect to the electrostatic potential was mapped and the dipole moment values were calculated in the corresponding direction. As shown in Fig. S2, the sulfonate group makes an aromatic ring electron-rich, while the ammonium group renders an aromatic ring electron-poor. For this reason, the dipole moment of the PEI-S points from the sulfonate group, while the dipole moments of the others point toward the ammonium group. The magnitude of the dipole moments is 7.44, 8.67, 9.50 and 10.38 D for the PEI-S, PEI-N, PEI-NdMeN and PEI-mN, respectively. According to these calculation results, the ammonium group enhances the magnitude of the dipole moment compared to the sulfonate group. Moreover, both the dimethylamine on the benzene and the methylene spacer between the benzene and the ammonium group also increase the magnitude of the dipole moment owing to the inductive effect. These results indicate the various functionalities can modulate the WF values to be used as CIMs for the devices.

Based on the reaction mechanism results and the theoretical computations, we designed and synthesized a new series of the stable CIMs (Fig. 3). Not only to remove the reactive primary amines on the PEI but also to introduce additional functionalities, we chose the simple imine formation reaction to synthesize the various functionalized-PEI (Fig. 4a, Scheme S2). For the next step to remove the secondary amines of PEI-mNBr, the methylation reaction was conducted using different equivalents of methyl iodide (see the ESI). At this point, the following questions might be raised: (i) where the methylation reaction occurs (on the imine or the secondary amine), (ii) which amines are more reactive, and (iii) how many equivalents of methyl iodide are applied to obtain fully quaternized ammonium compounds. The use of model compounds can help answer those questions because it is rather difficult to analyze the chemical structures of the polymer products from the methylation reaction. To prove that the methylation reaction does not occur on the nitrogen of imine, 1 equivalent of the methyl iodide was added into the solution of the TEA-N (Scheme S2). We found that a methyl group was only attached to the nitrogen of a tertiary amine. Furthermore, to clarify which nitrogen (a secondary amine or a tertiary amine) is more reactive and how many equivalents of methyl iodide are necessary to obtain fully quaternized compounds, the methylation reaction of N,N-diethyl-N′-methylethylenediamine was conducted by adding two and ten equivalents of the methyl iodide. As expected, the secondary amine is more reactive than the tertiary amine because very minor peaks are found from δ 4.0 to δ 3.6 ppm in the NMR when two equivalents of methyl iodide were added, indicating that the number of protons on the ethylene between the ammonium groups is small. We also synthesized N,N-diethyl-N′,N′-dimethylethylenediamine by a different synthetic route, in order to cross-check the NMR data. However, major peaks were found from δ 4.0 to δ 3.6 ppm in the NMR when ten equivalents of the methyl iodide were added, confirming that the ammonium groups were produced. It is also supported by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data (Fig. S51 and S52). Therefore, ammonium groups started to be produced when over two equivalents of the methyl iodide were added after the secondary amines are reacted preferentially, and all of the amine groups might be fully changed into ammonium groups when ten equivalents of the methyl iodide were added.
To demonstrate the WF tunability of the functionalized PEIs (Fig. 4b), their WF values were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in high vacuum and Kelvin probe (KP) in air. According to the UPS spectra (Fig. 4c), the WF values of the compounds (4.12, 4.03, 3.95, 3.87, 3.81, 4.18, 4.21, 4.26 and 4.37 eV for the PEI-S, PEI-N, PEI-NdMeN, PEI-mNI, PEI-mNBr, mtl2, mtl3, mtl5 and mtl10, respectively) are lower than that of indium tin oxide (ITO) (4.78 eV), which means that our compounds can be used as CIMs. These results can be explained by the efficient formation of a surface dipole layer; the strength of dipole and concomitant WF change can be determined by the ionic functionality of polyelectrolytes. The WF values extracted from the KP measurements showed a similar trend. All WF values are summarized in Table S1.
For the basic characterization of the thermal properties, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed in an inert atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S3a, the thermal stability of the polyelectrolytes was determined by the degradation temperature at a weight loss of 5% from the initial weight (220, 179, 155, 184, 192, 198, 228, 177 and 225 °C for the PEI-S, PEI-N, PEI-NdMeN, PEI-mNI, PEI-mNBr, mtl2, mtl3, mtl5 and mtl10, respectively). By the DSC curves (Fig. S3b), there is no particular thermal transition except for the glass transition (69, 78, 50, 91, 72, 74, 78, 71 and 87 °C for the PEI-S, PEI-N, PEI-NdMeN, PEI-mNI, PEI-mNBr, mtl2, mtl3, mtl5 and mtl10, respectively). In other words, our polymers do not show any crystalline phases owing to the branched structures of the PEI, which makes them soluble thoroughly to have excellent processibility. As shown in Fig. S3c, we also investigated the transmittance spectra of the polymer thin films ranging from 300 nm to 1000 nm on the ITO glass, which used as a background. The synthesized polymers scarcely absorb visible light and near-infrared light, indicating that they do not interfere with photon harvesting in the active layer.
To manifest how much N+ (a cationic character from nitrogen) and N (a neutral character from nitrogen) with and without heat treatment exist in our polymers, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted (Fig. S4). As expected, the PEI-mNBr, mtl2, mtl3, mtl5 and mtl10 with and without heat treatment contain N+. In particular, the ratio of N+ to N for the methylated compounds increases gradually as the amount of the applied methyl iodide increases due to the increase in ammonium ions inside the polymers (Table S2). Surprisingly, the ratio of N+ to N for the PEI with heat treatment decreases compared to that of N+ to N for the PEI without heat treatment. This could happen due to the removal of the solvent from the PEI, indicating that the PEI is coordinated by the solvent molecules through the non-covalent bonding such as the hydrogen bonding rather than undergoing the protonation reaction which is originated from an acid–base reaction. However, this phenomenon does not occur in the PEI-mNBr, mtl2, mtl3, mtl5 and mtl10 with heat treatment. This result is supported by the atomic concentration ratio of N+ to total nitrogen in Table S2.

As expected, the methylated functionalized-PEIs do not react with the IT-4F because the secondary amines are removed (Scheme S2). However, the PEI-mNBr exhibits tenuous reactivity to the IT-4F because the secondary amines are located inside the PEI-mNBr, unlike the diethylamine, which helps to enhance tolerance to the reaction. This is supported by the UV-VIS absorption spectra where there is no difference between the absorption spectra of the pristine IT-4F and that of the mixture of the IT-4F and the PEI-mNBr after heat treatment (Fig. S5a). In the FT-IR spectra, however, the vibrational peaks of the mixture of the IT-4F and the PEI-mNBr after heat treatment are shown at 2192 and 2219 cm−1 simultaneously, indicating that the unwanted reaction partially occurs, whereas the methylated functionalized-PEIs remain inactive to the IT-4F after heat treatment (Fig. S5b). From the resonant Raman spectroscopy results as shown in Fig. S6, significant increases in relative peak intensities associated with core groups of IT-4F (peaks at 1597 and 1344 cm−1 for the phenyl, and peaks at 1462 and 1431 cm−1 for the thiophenes) are observed from PEI-mNBr:IT-4F, implying the increased π-electron density in the core units. We suggest this is due to the disruption of the interunit alkene (1544 cm−1) in IT-4F, which likely impedes π-electron delocalization along the conjugation backbone and concentrates the electron density to the core. In contrast, no substantial change in Raman signal was observed in PEI-mtl10:IT-4F, indicating an enhanced thermal stability with the absence of secondary amines. To further inspect whether ammonium groups are removed, tBu-N was used as a model compound. As shown in Fig. S9, the tBu-N and the trimethylamine with the IT-4F do not react, which means Hofmann elimination reaction does not occur. Therefore, our polymers have enough thermal stability to be applied as the CIMs in OSCs.


To investigate the impact of the CIMs on device performance, we fabricated inverted OSCs with the configuration of ITO/CIM/photoactive layer/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/Ag, in which bulk heterojunction layers of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexylthio)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T-SF):IT-4F were used as the photoactive layer (Fig. 5a). The molecular structures of the photoactive materials are shown in Fig. S10. Because MoO3 provides excellent hole-selective characteristics, it is highly expected that device performance can be largely affected by the CIMs. The resulting current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the devices with the different CIMs are compared in Fig. 5b and c, and photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the devices with the CIMs exhibit higher performance than the CIM-free devices that exhibit an inferior PCE value of 3.3%. With the ZnO interfacial layer, the devices yield high photovoltaic characteristics with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 0.84 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) value of 19.32 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) value of 0.71, and a corresponding PCE value of 11.54%, which is attributable to the low-lying WF and deep valance band edge of ZnO interlayer, providing efficient electron collection and hole blocking properties. By placing a thin layer of the functionalized PEI, including PEI-S, PEI-N, PEI-NdMeN, and PEI-mNI and PEI-mNBr, instead of ZnO, the devices exhibit a gradual improvement in overall performance parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF) with WF values ranging from 4.12 to 3.81 eV, producing PCE values of 6.84%, 10.05%, 11.04%, 12.01%, and 12.34%, respectively (Fig. S11). The performance enhancements along with WF reduction are attributed to the reduced energy barrier for electron extraction. Notably, although ITO/PEI possesses the lowest WF that is sufficient to secure ohmic contact to both the fullerene acceptor (e.g., PCBM) and the IT-4F, the PEI-based devices present significant resistive behavior, so-called “S-shape”, near Voc, which might be ascribed to the degraded interface induced by chemical interaction between the PEI and the IT-4F (Fig. S12, and Table S3). In case of the devices with the methylated CIMs, the moderate performances were obtained (Fig. S13 and Table S4).

The low surface WF of the cathode can provide (i) a reduced charge extraction energy barrier through good energetic alignment with photoactive materials and (ii) an increased built-in field across the photoactive layers by enlarging the difference in WF values between the cathode and the anode, both of which are beneficial for efficient electron collection. We first analyzed the interfacial electrical properties, such as charge transport resistance (Rct), by using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Fig. 5d shows the impedance spectra of the devices with the CIMs as measured under the open-circuit conditions with illumination. The Nyquist plots of the impedance spectra were fitted to an equivalent circuit model (Fig. S14), and the corresponding resistance parameters are summarized in Table S5. The Rct values at the interfaces are estimated to be 320, 94, 80, 57, and 52 Ω for the devices with the PEI-S, PEI-N, PEI-NdMeN, PEI-mNI, and PEI-mNBr, respectively, and can be reduced as the WF of ITO/CIM decreases, thus lowering the energy barrier for electron extraction. We note that these results agree with the measured J–V characteristics, and a similar trend is observed under dark conditions.
For the simple estimation of built-in potential, the J–V characteristics of inverted homo-junction (i.e., IT-4F-only) devices with the various CIMs under illumination were measured. As shown in Fig. 5e, the applied voltage where no current is allowed to flow is proportional to the magnitude of WF change of ITO by the CIMs, |ΔWF|; the Voc values to cancel out the built-in field increase gradually from 0.438 V to 0.871 V for PEI-S and PEI-mNBr, respectively. The CIMs are also compatible with PBDB-T-SF-only devices, demonstrating Voc values from 0.442 V to 0.981 V (Fig. S15). In addition, we observed concurrent improvement in EQE and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) as the WF values of the ITO-containing functionalized PEI decrease, which implies efficient extraction of photogenerated charge carriers under the enhanced internal electric field (Fig. 5c and Fig. S16). The photovoltaic behavior as a function of illumination intensity also provides useful insight into the recombination kinetics of the devices, implying that suppressed recombination becomes more pronounced as the effective WF of the ITO/CIM is reduced (Fig. S17).
It is important to emphasize that such ultrathin polyelectrolyte layers, which are known as electrical insulators, provide excellent charge selectivity in the devices. To further explore the operational mechanism of our functionalized-PEI CIMs, we performed surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement with a structure of ITO/CIM/PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F (Fig. 5f). The SPV signal represents the surface potential change of the photoactive layer upon photoexcitation. The origin of SPV is the spatial redistribution of photogenerated charge carriers due to the internal electric field, and thus the photoinduced SPV can provide information on the interfacial energetics between the CIM and photoactive layers. The negative (hundreds of meV) SPV signals measured with CIM layers indicate efficient extraction of photogenerated electrons via the CIM and hole accumulation at the surface of the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F layer (Fig. S18). Importantly, much larger and faster SPV signal is observed with reducing energy barrier at the ITO/CIM interfaces, indicating more efficient electron extraction and suppressed recombination losses. The fast SPV turn-on response can be attributed to the high built-in electric field due to the presence of CIM layer providing a strong driving force for the better electron extraction from the photoactive layer, thereby endowing the functionalized-PEI CIMs with excellent charge selectivity. It is important to notice that the PEI-mNBr CIM exhibits the fast and most stable SPV response (i.e. the fast and stable charge extraction), which leads to the best device performance (Table 1).

The reduced chemical reactivity between our CIMs and the NFAs could lead to the improved thermal stability of the devices. To address this issue, we investigated the stability of the devices with the various CIMs under thermal stress. The stability tests were carried out at 100 °C for 360 hours in a dry air atmosphere. Fig. 6 presents the degradation profiles of photovoltaic parameters for the devices. As a result, in terms of the device PCE value based on the PEI, the performance rapidly degrades to nearly 30% of its initial value after 200 hours. Due to the higher chemical inertness, however, PEI-mNBr enables thermally stable device operation, retaining more than 80% of the initial device PCE value for up to 360 hours. Moreover, the devices with mtl CIMs (i.e., mtl2, mtl3, mtl5, and mtl10) are even more stable than those with the other CIMs, which retain the majority of their initial PCE values after the stability test. Since no significant change in their surface roughness values is detected after the thermal treatment, the thermal-induced degradation of the devices is rarely associated with their surface morphological stability (Fig. S19).


In addition to the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F, we also incorporated the functionalized PEI into the recently developed high performance 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,1′-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) NFA devices. Fig. 7 shows the J-V characteristics and EQE spectra of the Y6 devices with the representative CIMs. Again, the PEI devices exhibit poor device performance with a Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE value of 0.83 V, 23.33 mA cm−2, 0.41, and 8.38%, respectively, whereas efficient photovoltaic performance is evident in the control device fabricated using PEI-mNBr with a high PCE value of 15.31%, a Voc value of 0.87 V, a Jsc value of 25.62 mA cm−2 and a FF value of 0.70, which are higher than those of the ZnO reference device (a PCE value of 14.95%) for the best PCE value (Table 2). These results indicate the wider applicability of the functionalized-PEI CIMs in state-of-the-art non-fullerene acceptor systems.

In conclusion, we have unveiled a reaction between the INCN-based NFAs and the PEI using the T-2F and the DEDA as the model compounds. According to the 15N-isotopic labeling experiments and the 2D NMR studies, the undesired product is produced by the 1,4-addition reaction of the amine functional groups on the vinyl carbon connecting the thiophene and the INCN. Furthermore, the 1,4-addition results in breaking the conjugated structures of the INCN-based NFAs. Due to the high reactivity of the PEI, we masked the reactive amines to obtain a new series of the functionalized PEIs by the imine formation reaction with various functionalized aldehydes, and by the methylation reaction. The magnitude of the dipole moment of the functionalized PEIs was modulated, which is determined by the change of the WF values ranging from 4.37 to 3.81 eV. The excellent stability of the methylated functionalized-PEIs is confirmed by the UV-VIS and the FT-IR spectra, while the PEI-mNBr shows weak reactivity to the IT-4F due to the secondary amines. The successful combination of the reduced chemical reactivity and the WF adjustability in the versatile functionalized-PEIs led to highly stable and efficient OSCs with a PCE of 15.31%. Comprehensive surface energetics and electro-optical studies revealed that the low effective WF of electrodes enabled the efficient and selective extraction of electrons with suppressed recombination losses by reducing an energy barrier and reinforcing the internal electric field. In addition, devices with the methylated functionalized-PEIs exhibited thermally stable behavior, maintaining the majority of their PCE values during 360 hours at 100 °C. We believe that our findings provide a useful insight into how NFA molecules chemically interact with amine-containing polyelectrolytes, and that this research helps to establish the important CIM design principle for efficient and stable non-fullerene OSCs.
