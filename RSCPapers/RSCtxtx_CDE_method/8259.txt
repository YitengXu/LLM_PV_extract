A novel metal complex redox material is synthesized via coordinating the iron metal site with 1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (npbi) ligands, herein named as Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3. The as-synthesized Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material has a good redox potential (0.43 V vs. NHE), low Gibbs free energy (1.86 eV), low reorganization energy (1.90 eV), high diffusion coefficient and less driving force in an electrolyte system for dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) and supercapacitor (SC) applications to accomplish huge quasi-reversible redox operations between the electrode/electrolyte interfaces of the devices. Interestingly, the DSC with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 electrolyte and an organic dye achieved a conversion efficiency of 2.96% under 1 sun illumination. This high power efficiency is attributed to a potential matching of this redox system with the organic dye, which can diminish the recombination reactions and improve the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the DSC. At the same time, the addition of Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 in a symmetric SC with a H2SO4 electrolyte and graphene oxide electrodes contributes to an additional Faradaic reaction (electro-sorb mechanism) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This results in the corresponding SC displaying a high energy density of 29.79 W h kg−1 at a power density of 719 W kg−1 and long charge/discharge stability for 11000 cycles with 97.4% capacity retention respectively. Overall, this study offers new insights on designing appropriate transition metal complex redox materials for both DSC and SC applications with boosted efficiencies.

Nowadays, solar energy conversion and storage is vital to meet world energy demands, control emissions, minimize environmental risks and increase sustainability. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), photovoltaic devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) even under low illumination are low-cost and easily fabricated; thus making them attractive for indoor electrical applications. Effective energy utilization can be realized when the electrical energy from DSCs is combined with a specialized energy storage device for later use. Supercapacitors (SCs) are promising next-generation energy storage devices with high specific power and specific energy that “fill-up” for the gap between conventional capacitors and secondary batteries. Whether for DSC or SC applications, the electrolyte forms a key component for electron or ion transfer, respectively, thus significantly affecting device performance.

In a typical DSC, the electrolyte consists of a redox shuttle that plays a crucial role to regenerate dye molecules at the photo-anode, and to gain the electron at the photo-cathode, thus completing the circuit. Conventionally, I3−/I− redox shows better performance with ruthenium-based dyes in DSCs. However, iodine redox has its own drawbacks including low potential, absorption of light within a narrow range (350–450 nm), being corrosive towards the cathode and offering low cell stability thereby impeding its use for large-scale DSC production. These limitations can be overcome via the introduction of cobalt-based redox shuttles that aid the achievement of higher PCE values of 12–14.0% with organic dyes. However, the PCE and industrialization of DSCs can be restricted due to their large reorganization energy and the low stability of the Co2+ (bipyridine) complex (high-spin-t2g5eg2). In the search for stable and eco-friendly redox active materials, researchers introduced Fe-based redox shuttles including Fe (bipyridine) with high potential and highly stable Fe2+ (low-spin-t2g6eg0), and also Fe (tert-pyridine), Fe (phenanthroline), and Fe (6,6′-bis(1,1-di(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine), respectively. The corresponding DSCs displayed about 0.3–2.3% PCE with organic dyes. These results motivate the use of highly active Fe-based electrolytes for the development of next-generation DSCs with higher PCEs.
On the other hand, studies on supercapacitor development have reported extensively on electrodes including graphene/derivates-based materials and transition metal oxides. Contrastingly, research on electrolytes for SCs is less developed. Very recently, facilitating redox activity in electrolytes has emerged as a promising research path to develop next-generation supercapacitors with battery-like cycling stabilities, energy densities, and power densities. Generally, redox mediator reactions in an electrolyte produce high pseudo capacitance in addition to the enhanced Faradaic reaction at the electrolyte/electrode (carbon) interface. Several redox shuttles, such as KI, C6H4 (OH)2, K3Fe(CN)6, and CuCl2 integrated in aqueous electrolytes significantly improve electrode capacitance. Further capacitance enhancement is realized via the combination of redox-active electrolytes or the opening of dual redox-active electrolyte materials with pseudocapacitive electrode materials. For SCs, commercial redox active electrolytes like KOH and H2SO4, used so far, intrinsically tend to constrain the voltage window to ∼1 V thus limiting the overall energy density and cyclic stability. Specifically, some of Fe2+/3+ based redox shuttle species from K4Fe(CN)6, FeSO4·7H2O + Fe2(SO4)3, and K3Fe(CN)6, respectively, in aqueous electrolytes reported energy densities of 20.0, 22.1 and 28.3 W h kg−1 with a limited cycle stability. Hence, Fe-based redox reactions are attractive for investigation as electrolyte additives for SCs.
Herein, for the first time, we introduce 1-substituted 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole ligands bearing the iron complex Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 as an effective redox shuttle with DTTCY ((E)-3-(5-((E)-2-(1-(5-(2,2-bis(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)vinyl)thiophen-2-yl)-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-cyanovinyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid) as an organic dye in DSC to improvise the PCE of Fe electrolyte-based DSCs. Further, we use this redox active iron complex, Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 as an additive in the H2SO4 electrolyte to enrich the energy density and stability of Fe redox active aqueous SCs. In other words, we designed a novel Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material with advantages including a high redox potential, enhanced electrochemical redox activity, low Gibbs free energy, low visible light absorption, being diamagnetic in the Fe2+ state (low spin), and highly stable during the electrochemical reaction. In addition, the structural properties of the prepared iron redox shuttle is probed using computational studies to understand the effect on the corresponding performances in DSC and SC applications, respectively. This work lays down a significant basis towards the design and development of tunable transition metal-based complex redox shuttle materials that are versatile for the dual applications of DSC and SC in the field of energy conversion and storage systems.

FeSO4·7H2O, 4-tertiary butyl pyridine, PbO2, LiClO4, CH3OH, dry CH3CN, KPF6, H2SO4, reduced graphene oxide, and TBAPF6 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich chemicals and used without any further purification process. The dye DTTCY and the ligand npbi were synthesized as per our previous report.


The iron complexes were synthesized by a modified procedure reported in previous literature. The synthetic route followed for the formation of the iron complexes is shown in Fig. 1. FeSO4·7H2O (1.8 mmol) in 5 mL of H2O precursor was added to a stirred methanolic solution (20 mL) of ligand npbi (5.6 mmol) and was subsequently, refluxed for 2 h.

A precursor solution of FeSO4·7H2O (1.8 mmol) in 5 mL of H2O was added into a methanolic solution (20 mL) of ligand npbi (5.6 mmol) under stirring and was subsequently, refluxed for 2 h. After the reaction mixture was cooled to RT, 1 M H2SO4 was introduced and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. Thereafter, an oxidizing agent PbO2 (6.2 mmol) is added and the mixture is cooled to 0 °C. Then, aq.KPF6 (5.6 mmol) is added and stirred for 15 min to get the preferred violet colored product. The resultant product was filtered, washed with CH3OH/H2O and dried under vacuum. The yield of the product was 27%, ESI-MS cal. C69H51F18FeN9P3 [M]+ 1496.25 found 1498.40. Elemental analysis cal.

The NMR, ESI-MS and FTIR data are given in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI). The optimized structures, bond angles and HOMO, LUMO pictures of the iron complexes are shown in Fig. 2 and 3.


A Bruker 500 MHz instrument was used to analyze the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum. The electron spray injection mass spectrum was recorded with an LC/MS, 6230B time of flight spectrometer, Agilent technologies. The Fourier transformation infrared spectrum was measured using a Shimadzu IR tracer (wavenumber 400–4000 cm−1) and the ultraviolet visible spectrum characterization was carried under an Analytik Jena, Specord 210 plus model. The micro-elemental study was determined with a PerkinElmer CHN-2400. The cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrum and galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments were performed on a BIOLOGIC-SP300 potentiostat. The current/voltage curve was measured on a Keithley meter (series-2400) attached with a (Class AAA, Newport) solar simulator-xenon light source and fitted with a standard filter AM1.5.


TiO2 nano-powder (P25) (500 mg) and PEG (15 mg) were mixed with 1 M HNO3 (2.5 mL), acetylacetone (0.3 mL) and Triton-X (2 drops). Subsequently, the mixture was sonicated for 1 h at RT and stirred for 24 h at RT to get the fine TiO2 paste. 2 cm × 2 cm FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) plates were thoroughly washed with deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol via ultra-sonication for 15–20 min and then the plates were treated with an aq. TiCl4 (40 mM) solution for 30 min at 70 °C. Afterwards, the plates were heated to 100 °C on a hot plate and were coated with the prepared TiO2 paste by a doctor-blade method and then kept for sintering in a tubular furnace at 450 °C for 45 min. A constant thickness of about 25 μm was maintained for all plates. To absorb the dye on to the TiO2 coating, the prepared photo-anodes were immersed in 0.5 mM of DTTCY dye or N3 dye (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)) dissolved in ethanol solution for 24 h under dark conditions. Subsequently, the anodes were rinsed many times with H2O/C2H5OH to remove the excess dye. The cell active area is around (0.5 × 0.5) 0.25 cm2. The Pt-coated counter electrodes were prepared by drop-casting 4 mM H2[Pt(Cl)6] on a pre-cleaned FTO plate before sintering the plates at 450 °C for 45 min. A pre-drilled hole was made on the backside of the Pt coated side of the plates. A total of 0.2 M of Fe(II), 0.02 M of Fe(III) 0.5 M of TBP and 0.1 M of LiClO4 in dry CH3CN were mixed well for 15 min at RT. The prepared photoanode, electrolyte and photocathode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell. The prepared electrolyte was filled via the pre-drilled hole of the photocathode using a vacuum syringe. A Surlyn spacer was used as a sealing material between the two electrodes and a circular cap with a sealing film was attached to the pre-drilled hole of photocathode to avoid electrolyte leakage.


The symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated with efficiently structured graphene oxide (GO) coated anode and cathode materials, along with an electrolyte membrane made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel and H2SO4 that was bound to Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox shuttles and a separator made of cellulose. The slurry prepared with the active material (GO), carbon black and PVDF binder, respectively, in the ratio 8: 1:1 was coated on to a carbon cloth and left to dry overnight at 120 °C. In order to make the gel electrolyte, 1 g of PVA was dissolved in 20 mL of DI water, and then the mixture was heated to 80 °C until translucent. Separately, a total of 0.04 M of Fe (II) and 0.08 M of Fe(III) was dissolved in acetonitrile and added to a 1 M H2SO4 solution. The mixed solution was then sonicated for 15 min and then introduced drop-by-drop to the translucent PVA gel before aggressive stirring for 30 min to obtain the redox active electrolyte. Finally, the prepared electrolyte and the separator were sandwiched between the anode and cathode to form the asymmetric supercapacitor.


The redox behavior of the prepared iron complex was analyzed via a cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment in a three-electrode system at room temperature with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and the resulting plot is shown in Fig. 4a. The system consists of a working electrode (Pt disc), a counter electrode (Pt wire) and a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl). A total amount of 3.0 mM of the iron complex (Fe2+ [npbi]3) and 0.1 M of the supporting electrolyte (TBA PF6) were dissolved in dry CH3CN and formed the electrolyte solution for CV. A one-electron redox stroke was observed at 0.48 V & 0.38 V, respectively, for the Fe(II) → Fe(III) transition and vice versa for Fe2+ [npbi]3. Even, after 50 cycles, Fe2+ [npbi]3 sustains a stable redox potential value (E1/2 = 0.43 V vs. NHE) that clearly confirms the stability and constant one-electron redox nature of this new iron complex redox material. In our previous report, the nbpi ligand-coordinated cobalt redox material (Co2+ [npbi]3) attained an E1/2 value of about 0.41 V vs. NHE. Interestingly, the replacement of the Co metal site with Fe in the complex attributes a 20 mV increment in the E1/2 value with better stability (high spin complex → low spin complex). This occurs mainly due to the role of naphthyl group-substituted 2-pyridinyl benzimidazole ligands in the complex, which consist of nitrogen elements (strong coordination species) and more electron-delocalized substitution units. A stable quasi-reversible redox nature at a positive window potential (∼0.1–0.8 V) authorizes Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 to act as a promising redox additive for both DSCs and SCs, respectively. The apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) for Fe2+ [npbi]3 and Fe3+ [npbi]3 were determined from CV experiments under a slow scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using the following formula.
where
ilim – limiting current value; n – number of electrons; F – Faraday's constant; L – distance between the electrodes; C0 – concentration of the electrolytes. Herein, the Dapp results of the Fe2+ [npbi]3 and Fe3+ [npbi]3 complexes were calculated as 12.1× 10−6 to 14.9 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 owing to their mass transport limitations arising from their different molecular weights (Table 1). But, these Dapp values are higher than some other reported cobalt redox shuttles and imply that the iron complexes promote facile diffusion in porous structures.

A UV-spectroscopic study was performed for 0.5 mM Fe2+ [npbi]3 and 0.5 mM Fe3+ [npbi]3 complexes in an acetonitrile solvent separately under ambient temperatures within the wavelength range of 200–800 nm and the resulting graphs are shown in Fig. 4b. Fe2+ [npbi]3 acquired absorption peaks at wavelengths of 323 nm and 539 nm correspondingly. At the same time, Fe3+ [npbi]3 showed absorption peaks lower-shifted to 329 nm and 534 nm respectively (Table 1). This small shift can be related to the different oxidation states of iron in the prepared complexes. Therefore, the CV and UV studies conclude that these new Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox shuttles have the capacity to work for dual applications with decent electrochemical redox activities.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material with DTTCY and N3 dye in DSC was carried, respectively, under 1 sun illumination from a frequency of 0.1 Hz to 106 MHz with a perturbation voltage of 10 mV. The resulting EIS plot (in Fig. 5a) was fitted using Zfit software to find the series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance and chemical capacitance at the electrolyte/Pt interfaces (Rpt and Cpt) and at the electrolyte/TiO2 interfaces (Rct and CTiO2) of the DSC device respectively. The EIS results are tabulated in Table 2. The Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox/DTTCY dye containing device obtained lower Rs (27.07 Ohm), and Rpt (2.78 Ohm) values, a higher Rct (14.62 Ohm) values and high chemical capacitance at both electrodes (∼6.34–15.38 × 10−6 F). At the same time, the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox/N3 dye containing device showed higher Rs (40.84 Ohm), and Rpt (3.08 Ohm) values, a lower Rct (13.18 Ohm) value and an average chemical capacitance at both electrodes (∼5.12–14.02 × 10−6 F). These values obviously validate that the DSC device with the stable Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material and DTTCY has good ionic conductivity, a larger charge at the photocathode and lower electron recombination at the photoanode than the DSC device with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material and the N3 commercial dye. Overall the interfacial studies conclude that DTTCY dye is the best one to work with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material in the DSC. The electron lifetimes (τn) of the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material with DTTCY and the N3 dye in the DSC, respectively, were determined from the Bode phase plots (in Fig. 5b) using the following formula.
Where,
fmax is the frequency at maxima phase peak. Herein, the lifetime reached a better magnitude of 2.70 × 10−4 s for the DSC with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox/DTTCY dye than the lifetime value of 1.89 × 10−4 s for the DSC with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox/N3 dye. This is due to the lower reorganization energy of the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox shuttles and a better potential matching of this Fe redox electrolyte with DTTCY dye. From the EIS interface and lifetime studies, the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox shuttle with the metal-free organic dye DTTCY readily reduces the charge recombination between the photoanode and the electrolyte, increasing the PCE of the DSC with the organic dye than the PCE delivered by the metal-dye based device. The potential of the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox shuttle and DTTCY dye plays a vital role to sustain the efficiency of the device. Utilizing this redox potential value, the quasi Fermi level of TiO2 (EF,n) is calculated as follows.

Interestingly, EF,n of the TiO2 resulted in a downward shift as −0.28 V vs. NHE improves the electron lifetime and facilitates enhancement in the current density of the DSC. The photovoltaic performances of the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material with DTTCY and N3 dye, respectively, in the DSCs were analyzed under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The efficiency plots are shown in Fig. 5e and the results are tabulated in Table 2.
The DSC with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 electrolyte and DTTCY dye achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.96% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.72 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.5 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63, respectively. On other hand, the same redox system with the N3 dye in the DSC reached a lower PCE of 1.10%. The PCE results were obtained from averaging the results of three DSC devices under 1 sun condition using SD approximation. Herein, the PCE varied about 2.4 times between the DTTCY and N3 dye with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material thereby proving the importance of a potential scale match of the redox electrolytes with the dyes. The DTTCY has a closer potential of 0.84 V vs. NHE to the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox system potential (0.43 V vs. NHE) than the N3 dye having a higher potential of 1.10 V vs. NHE. This causes the combination of the DTTCY dye with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox system to achieve a higher PCE than the cell using the commercial N3 dye. Mechanistically, the electron regeneration at the photoanode is faster for the DTTCY dye than in the N3 dye and thus, obviously, the DSC with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 electrolyte and the DTTCY dye reached a high current density. Overall, the electrochemical and photovoltaic results majorly depend on the reorganization energy, electronic structure, geometry, potential of the iron complex redox material and dye. Especially, the structural and electronic effect of the bulkier ligands (1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole) of the iron complex sustains the reorganization property, potential, electrode interfacial results and also the PCE of the DSC device. To the best to our knowledge, the obtained PCE results are the highest among iron complex redox mediator based DSCs reported so far (Table 3).

The CV plots for the symmetric SC in H2SO4 and H2SO4 + Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox active electrolytes, respectively, at the scan rate of 15 mV s−1 are displayed in Fig. 6a. The SC with only the H2SO4 electrolyte showed a rectangular curve which can be due to the ideal condition of an electrical double layer capacitor, inferring that charge/discharge happens reversibly at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. While the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 (redox active) species is added into the H2SO4 electrolyte, high oxidation (∼0.45 V) and low reduction (∼0.18 V) peaks attributed to the Faradaic reaction between the RGO electrodes and the Fe(II)/Fe(III) species appeared with a current increment in the corresponding CV curve.

The appearance of redox peaks specified that the incorporation of the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox active material enhances the capacitance of the electrode. The corresponding CV curve areas indicate that the respective capacitive performance comes from the double layer capacitance of the RGO electrode and the pseudo-capacitance owing to the Faradaic reaction of the redox active material, as expected. The CV responses at different scan rates (in Fig. 6b) were tested for the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox active material containing SC. The series of CV curves attributed excellent current density improvement (around 0.8–2.8 mA) with a gradual increase in scan rates starting from 15 to 55 mV s−1, indicating the occurrence of a surface-limited electrochemical process. Moreover, while increasing the scan rate, the oxidation and reduction peaks moved towards the positive and negative current scale, respectively due to the internal resistance of the electrode. Basically, the operating voltage window of the aqueous electrolyte based SCs reached around 1 V. Different voltage windows were analyzed in Fig. S3 (ESI) respectively to optimize the voltage to 1.2 V for the SC with H2SO4 + Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3. To further assess the performance of the capacitor with the redox active electrolyte, a galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) study was carried out in various current densities of 1–5 A g−1 and the respective plots are displayed in Fig. 6c. From the GCD curves, the specific capacitance (CSC – F g−1) is calculated using the following formula.
where, Δ
t is the discharge time, I is the discharge current, m is the mass of the active material and ΔV represents the voltage window of the device. Interestingly, the complete shape of the charge–discharge outline sustains a symmetric shape upon increasing the charge–discharge current rates. At the initial current density of 1 A g−1, the highest specific capacitance of 41.38 F g−1 is registered. Thus, upon increasing the current density from 2 to 5 A g−1, the capacitance of the SC with H2SO4 + Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox active electrolyte decreased from 38.80 to 29.79 F g−1 respectively, as shown in Fig. 6d. This trend infers that the contribution of the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox electrolyte on the pseudo capacitive behavior continuously decreases while the current density is increased. The charge discharge mechanism of the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material at the electrodes of the SC is as follows:

The electrochemical capacitive reaction between the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 consisting of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions and the carbon-based SC electrode can be explained via an electro-sorb mechanistic process of H+ and Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 species. This reaction drastically promotes the formation of Faradaic–pseudo capacitance. A representative EIS plot of the SC with H2SO4 + Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox electrolyte is shown in Fig. 7a.
The EIS plot represents a depressed semicircle (at high frequency) and a small extended straight line (at low frequency) towards the imaginary axis. This trend, in general, is attributed to a superlative electrochemical capacitance nature. From this plot, the inner resistance (Ri) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) values were estimated as 63.28 Ω cm2 and 17.92 Ω cm2, respectively. This infers that the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox shuttle in the H2SO4 electrolyte readily improvises the conductivity and ion-transferring ability of the SC. Mainly, the GO electrode offers a high specific surface for the diffusion/migration of Fe2+/3+ and SO4− ions at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which reduces the internal resistance. Furthermore, the Bode phase plot of this electrolyte system in Fig. 7b shows a frequency maximum (fmax) value of 169.38 Hz at a maximum phase degree of 4.56. This is reflected as a lower lifetime (relaxation time) value of 1.87 ms for the SC with the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox electrolyte. The shorter relaxation time affords high-speed ion diffusion and transport performance in the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox-based SC. The above results thus reveal that the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material has a strong interfacial interaction behavior on RGO-based electrodes. The energy density (E – W h kg−1) and power density (P − W kg−1) values of the SCs are the two main factors, which can govern the application for SCs. These values are determined using the following equations.
E = 0.5CΔV2
Here, Δ
V is the voltage window of the device and t is the discharge time. The Ragone plot of energy density vs. power density for the present SC with the redox electrolyte is displayed in Fig. 7c. From this plot, it can be understood that, the power density values increase almost steadily with the decreasing energy density values for the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox material containing SC. Herein, a maximum E value of 29.79 W h kg−1 is obtained at a P value of 719 W kg−1. Further, even at a high P value of 1816 W kg−1, the E value is still maintained around 14.30 W h kg−1. Significantly, the Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox-based SC demonstrates high stability as this device withstands 11000 cycles of charge and discharge (in Fig. 7d) with a retention factor of 97.4%. These electrochemical results are among the best observed for redox-active SCs reported so far (Table 4). This concludes that the present novel Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox complex with bulkier ligands (1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole) can serve as a highly electrochemically active and sustainable material for carbon-based electrodes of redox active-SCs.

The determination of the suitability and performance of these iron-based redox couples is necessary for effective DSSC applications. The Predew–Breck–Ernest (PBE) exchange–correlation method, which is implemented in the CP2K program, was used to geometrically optimize the complex systems. The free energies were determined using the Gaussian 16 package, Becke's three-parameter functional, and the Lee–Yang–Parr hybrid functional (UB3LYP) with the Stuttgart-Dresden (SDD) double-zeta valence basis for the Fe atom and the 6-31(d,p) basis for the remaining atoms.Fig. 1 and 2 show the FMO contour plots while all the compounds with their computed geometries are presented in Fig. 2 and 3. The charge is transferred from the metal to ligands in the Fe2+ [npbi]3 (PF6−)2 and Fe3+ [npbi]3 (PF6−)3 complex systems, according to the transitions between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The calculated energy gap of Fe2+ [npbi]3 (PF6−)2 is 1.41 eV, which is lower than 2.76 eV calculated for the Fe3+ [npbi]3 (PF6−)3 complex system. This suggests that the charge transfer from metal to ligand is much more effective in Fe2+ [npbi]3 (PF6−)2.

In addition, the reorganization energy, which is the difference between the single-point energies of Fe2+ and Fe3+ have been computed for each complex to determine the free energy differences (ΔGox) for the oxidation of the Fe-complex systems (Table 5). It is not spontaneous because the change in free energy in this case is positive. Also, the simulated ΔG value and the reorganization energy of the Fe complex system are 1.86 eV and 1.90 eV respectively. To achieve greater photo voltages and also the high specific capacitance of the energy material, it is possible to keep the driving force for dye renewal and boost the capacitance of the material with these lower reorganization and Gibbs free energies.

In summary, novel Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox materials with a high redox potential and a low Gibbs free energy were successfully synthesized for dual energy applications including DSC and SC. The Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 redox shuttles as electrolytes of DSCs and electrolyte additives of SCs, respectively, enhance the electrochemical redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces thus exhibiting higher efficiencies in both devices. The DSC assembled with the configuration of TiO2 + DTTCY//Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3//Pt reached a significantly high PCE of 2.96% under a 1 sun condition, which is sustained with its Rct, Rpt, CTiO2, Cpt and τn results respectively. This outstanding PCE result is mainly due to the potential match of the redox material and dye molecule thus causing a lesser driving force and a subsequently lower recombination reaction. This finally leads the Voc and Jsc of the device. On the other hand, the symmetric RGO//H2SO4 + Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3//RGO SC attained an excellent energy density of 29.79 W h kg−1 at a power density of 719 W kg−1 with a high cycling stability and a capacity retention of 97.4% after 11000 cycles. This remarkable electrochemical property is explained based on an electro-sorb mechanism and the Faradaic behavior (pseudo capacitance) of Fe2+/3+ [npbi]3 towards the RGO electrodes. Overall, the present study provides new insights and opportunities to develop novel transition metal complex redox materials with high electro-active characteristics not only for DSC and SC applications but also to be considered for other energy storage devices including hybrid SCs and redox flow batteries.
