The development of A–D–A type heteroacenes for bulk-heterojunction solar cells has gained immense interest in the last 5–6 years due to their synthetic accessibility via new molecular design, facile functionalization, tunable optoelectronic properties, cost-effective device fabrication and high efficiencies. Specifically, they have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 18% as electron acceptors, demonstrating their effectiveness in replacing fullerene derivatives in OSCs. This review explores the important aspects of the structural modifications of A–D–A-type heteroacenes and their application in high performance binary, ternary and tandem OSCs. The modulation of functional groups and their influence on the frontier orbital tuning, blend morphology, and charge transport properties have been comprehensively discussed as a tool for correlating molecular structures and properties with device performance beneficial for new material design. Finally, their applications and prospects in semitransparent OSCs are discussed as potential for future technology.

Amaresh Mishra received his PhD in Physico-organic Chemistry from Sambalpur University (India, 2000). After a postdoctoral stay with Prof. G. R. Newkome (1999–2001) at the University of South Florida, he joined TIFR, Mumbai, as a Visiting Fellow in 2002, working with Prof. N. Periasamy. He then joined the group of Prof. P. Bäuerle, University of Ulm, Germany, as Alexander von Humboldt Fellow and continued as a Group Leader of organic solar cells research. Since 2016 he is continuing as Associate Professor at the Sambalpur University. His research includes the development of functional organic materials and nanomaterials for organic and perovskite solar cells.

Organic solar cells, which convert solar energy into electricity, are among the cleanest and low-cost renewable sources of energy. Due to their multiple advantages such as the use of eco-friendly functional materials with tunable properties, flexibility and light weight, they have shown tremendous applicability for both outdoor and indoor conditions. Recently, high power conversion efficiencies up to 18% have been achieved for organic solar cells by using newly designed light absorbing conjugated organic materials. The unique advantages of these absorber materials are their versatile synthesis, tunable optoelectronic properties and high efficiencies, enabling their large scale fabrication in the future. Moreover, the efficiency, cost and stability are the vital measures for realizing efficient devices for practical applications. In this context, conjugated heteroacene-based molecular materials with appropriate structural tuning and an excellent light harvesting ability have been found to be the core candidates for large scale fabrication. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the development of functional heteroacene-based donor and acceptor materials and their application in high performance OSCs. Different approaches to achieve these milestones using binary, ternary and tandem device structures, along with semitransparent devices for building integrated photovoltaics, are discussed.


Over the past few decades, conjugated organic materials containing delocalized π-electrons have played a pivotal role in determining the overall performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). These organic materials exhibit promising electronic properties, flexibility in their functionalization, and film forming properties, and involve simplified processing. The relentless effort of chemists has witnessed the development of a variety of conjugated polymers/small molecule materials with variable bandgaps (1.2 eV to ∼2.0 eV) and desired opto-electronic properties. In fact, the first OSC reported by Tang in 1986 was prepared by vacuum-deposition of the copper phthalocyanine donor (D) and the perylene derivative acceptor (A) in a bilayer structure; it achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.95% under simulated AM2, 75 mW cm−2 illumination. However, the major disadvantage of a bilayer structure is that the excitons which are generated within ∼10 nm of the interface (exciton diffusion length, LD) can be used for charge generation/separation. In vacuum-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells prepared by co-evaporation of D/A molecules, PCEs of ∼9% have been reported in single-junction devices. On the other hand, a BHJ prepared by solution-processing has huge advantages over that prepared by the vacuum technique, i.e. low-temperature processing, low production cost, deposition over flexible substrates and roll-to-roll processing. For solution-processing a large variety of molecules and polymers have been designed and synthesized. However, it has been a disadvantage for vacuum-deposition, where molecular weight plays a vital role. Over the years, many new polymers/small molecules have been developed and the PCEs of solution-processed OSCs have been enhanced from about 1% in 1995 to 18% in 2020. The major advantage of BHJs over bilayer structures is the formation of bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of D/A composite layers where a large fraction of excitons can be generated, separated and collected at the electrodes.

The major requirements for designing ideal D/A molecules for solution-processing include: (1) good solubility in processing solvent by inserting alkyl side chains; (2) tuning of their side chain length and position to optimize their morphology; (3) molecular backbone tuning for better spectral coverage, and lowering of their bandgap to improve short circuit current (JSC); (4) high mobility for better charge transport and reduced recombination; (5) suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies to guarantee high open circuit voltages (VOC); and (6) gradient energy offset for efficient exciton dissociation. These conjugated organic molecules/polymers are composed of electron rich donor and electron deficient acceptor components along the conjugated backbone, where intramolecular charge transfer occurs by photoexcitation.
The conjugated molecules are prepared either by connection of aromatic rings by C–C single bonds or by connection of fused aromatic/heteroaromatic rings via endocyclic carbon–carbon double bonds. Among the conjugated building blocks, fused heteroacenes have continued to draw the attention of researchers in recent years owing to their increased backbone rigidity, leading to low degrees of conformational disorder, better packing, strong e− delocalization, strong absorption and high absorption cross section (ε), lowering of the energy gap by strengthening parallel p-orbital interactions, and morphology control through substituents. The molecular rigidity can also lead to a decrease of the reorganization energy by suppressing the rotational disorder around interannular single bonds which enhance the charge carrier mobility and could improve charge transport properties.
The most frequently used acceptor materials in OSCs are PC61BM and PC71BM, due to their high electron affinity, ability to accept electrons easily, isotropic electron transport, and reversible reduction waves (Fig. 1). Many breakthrough research studies have been reported using polymer/small molecule donors and fullerene acceptors. However, it is difficult to tune the absorptions to longer wavelengths, energy levels and charge transport properties by chemical modification of fullerene acceptors. Therefore, conjugated molecules were developed for use as fullerene-free acceptors (FFAs), which when implemented in OSCs overcome the trade-off between the JSC and VOC, an intrinsic problem in fullerene-based devices. The successful use of FFAs in solution-processed BHJSCs was first reported ten years ago, with PCEs of 0.73–1.7% using BF-OMe and K12 acceptors, suggesting the formation of charge separated states (Fig. 1). From then onwards, the field has seen a constant development, with the PCEs reaching above 17% for binary, ternary and tandem devices due to the evolution of many promising materials and improvement in device optimization conditions. The most successful among the molecular families are the rylene diimide derivatives and A–D–A type heteroacenes. However, it is quite difficult to coherently classify and analyze all the molecular systems. Apart from molecular design, a small change in fabrication conditions can dramatically affect the overall device performance. The device performance basically depends on many factors including active layer composition, processing solvent, the D/A ratio, processing conditions (spin-coating, doctor blading, temperature, speed, etc.), the choice of solvent additive, annealing (thermal, solvent, mixed), and finally the choice of interlayer and electrode materials.
This review focused on the development of functional heteroacene-based conjugated molecules and their use as donor and acceptor materials in OSCs. We have intentionally excluded other molecular systems as those structures were already reviewed under various perspectives. Readers can refer to the corresponding reviews for further reading.Fig. 2 illustrates the PCE improvement over the years with heteroacene-based molecules. In the last few years, many heteroacene-based molecular donors and acceptors have been developed for OSCs; however, the correlation of molecular structure with device performance has rarely been analyzed. The device performance strongly relies on the active layer morphology, and an ideal morphology simultaneously improves the charge generation and reduces bimolecular recombination as well as voltage loss in the device. Several design strategies have been discussed, focusing mostly on the modulation of backbones, side-chain variations, types of end-groups and their functionalization. Finally, the advances in ternary and tandem devices using FFAs have been discussed, giving a guideline for the future direction of the field for applications in semitransparent OSCs.

The conventional and inverted device structures along with the energetics of the D:A components and their charge transport pathways are shown in Fig. 3. After light excitation, the organic donor molecule gets excited and forms a coulombically bound exciton (electron–hole pair) due to the low dielectric permittivity (εr ≈ 3 to 4) of the molecule. Therefore, to split the exciton, a second molecule with a high electron affinity and ionization potential is used as the electron acceptor. The exciton then travels to the D–A interface and the electron is injected into the acceptor and the hole remains at the donor. This phenomenon is mostly realized in fullerene-based solar cells where fullerenes are not absorbed in the visible region and only act as electron acceptors. Thus, the photocurrent generation is only limited by the donor material, see Fig. 3d. On the other hand, FFAs which show strong absorption in the visible to near-IR region can also participate in photoexcitation. After acceptor excitation, the acceptor forms excitons which inject holes into the donor HOMO and the electrons remain on the acceptor. Finally, the electrons and holes travel to their respective electrodes (Fig. 3e). This leads to an increase in total excitons and maximizes the photocurrent generation due to the absorption contribution from both D and A units. For efficient exciton dissociation and transport, a BHJ is typically used due to its large interfacial area. The PCE of a solar cell is evaluated by (JSC × VOC × FF)/Pin, where FF is the fill factor and Pin is the power of the input light. The JSC of the device depends on the absorption profiles and charge transport abilities of the photoactive materials. Ideally the photoactive material should absorb in the visible/near-infrared (NIR) region, which is the maximum absorption region of the solar radiation spectrum (450–900 nm) extending up to the infrared region. The VOC generally depends on the energy gap between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, and is influenced by various photon energy loss (Eloss) mechanisms. The Eloss can be minimized by adjusting the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the D/A materials. The FF is a key parameter to measure the quality of the solar cell and is calculated from the ratio of the maximum power the cell can generate to the product of VOC and JSC. The FF is related to the efficient extraction of photogenerated charge carriers by the electrodes.


E
loss = Eg − eVOC, where Eg is the smallest optical energy gap of donor or acceptor materials estimated from the absorption edge. The lower PCEs in fullerene-based OSCs are mainly due to the lower VOC arising from the large Eloss (>0.6 eV). This is mainly due to the large driving force, i.e. energetic offset (typically 0.3–0.5 eV) between the donor and fullerene acceptors and the energy level of the charge transfer state (ECT). In contrast, for FFAs an energetic offset of <0.3 eV is found to be sufficient to drive efficient charge separation in the devices. Therefore, FFAs can lower the Eloss and increase the VOC without affecting the JSC. For FFAs to maintain high VOC by reducing Eloss (suppressing the nonradiative recombination losses) the HOMO energy level of the acceptor can be raised without influencing the LUMO energy level.
The lower performance of OSCs relative to traditional inorganic solar cells is due to their inherent energy losses through multiple channels, such as bimolecular recombination, radiative and non-radiative losses and incompatible energetics. To overcome these losses, various strategies have been applied, which include new molecular design, interfacial modification, and use of ternary and tandem device structures. The structural design of heteroacene-based molecules seems to overcome some of these limitations, improves the device performance, and is the major focus of this review.

Compared to molecules for solution processing, the availability of molecules for vacuum-processing is very less. The major drawback is the restriction in molecular design, such as attachment of variable alkyl chains, elongation of the backbone, and insertion of functional groups. So far several molecules have been prepared and have shown high and competitive performance to solution-processed devices. Forrest and co-workers reported a series of dipolar D–A–A′ type molecules containing the benzodithienopyrrole donor and benzothiadiazole and dicyanovinylene acceptors, with their PCEs reaching up to 9.3% with C70 as the acceptor. Furthermore, a higher PCE of 10.6 ± 0.3% was reported using a biternary concept, where two binary blends stacked one above the other were deposited via gradient sublimation. Here a series of symmetrical A–D–A type heteroacene-based small molecules designed as donor materials for vacuum-processing is discussed (data presented in Table 1).

Bäuerle and co-workers developed a series of SN5-derivatives with small alkyl/aryl substituents (SN5-Pr, SN5-Hex and SN5-Tol) (Fig. 4). These molecules showed strong and intense absorption with suitable energy levels. In collaboration with Heliatek, vacuum-processed single-junction optimized OSCs gave the best PCE of 5.6% for the SN5-Pr:C60 blend using an active layer thickness of 20 nm due to the significant enhancement in FF (0.70). The SN5-Hex based device showed a moderate PCE of 3.7% with a FF of 0.49, while the PCE was further lowered to 0.7% for the SN5-Tol derivative as a result of the significant reduction of both JSC and FF (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The PCE was further improved to 6.5% when the film thickness was increased to 30 nm. AFM analyses showed a very different blend morphology and phase separation, correlating well with the trend observed in device performance: SN5-Pr > SN5-Hex ≫ SN5-Tol. Recently, using the SN5-Et:C60 blend an enhanced PCE of 5.96% was achieved for a 20 nm thick film and an odd–even effect of alkyl chains was identified, with even numbers showing the best results.
Moreover, OSCs were developed using a series of heterohexacene-based donor molecules with varying alkyl chains from propyl to heptyl (SN6-Pr to SN6-Hep). The alkyl chains have a marginal effect on their photophysical properties, while a significant difference could be seen in solar cell performance. An odd–even alkyl chain length dependency with superior solar cell performance for the odd numbers of alkyl chains could be observed. In the bilayer OSCs, SN6-Pr showed the best PCE of 5.0%, while in the BHJ devices all the molecules yielded PCEs around 6%, with the pentyl derivative SN6-Pen showing the best PCE of 7.1% using C60 as an acceptor.

In the last ten years, several molecular donors comprising carbazole, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole, and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole based fused heteroacenes, exhibiting excellent performance with PCEs of 6–9% in combination with fullerene derivatives, have been developed. The molecular design and performance of these donor materials have been well documented in some recent reviews.

Indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (IDT), a longer heteroacene, has been considered as a promising building block to develop molecules/polymers because of its superior electron donating, light absorbing and charge transport abilities. The π-orbital overlap between the aromatic rings in IDT is enhanced due to its structural co-planarity, which further reduces the conformational disorder, enhances the π electron delocalization and promotes the intermolecular π–π interaction. Although several polymer donors have been reported based on ITD units, there are only a few reports on oligomers for OSCs. Hou and co-workers reported the first small molecule donor IDT(BTTh2)2 based on an IDT core (Fig. 5), which showed a broad absorption with an Eoptg of 1.8 eV, and a deep HOMO energy level of −5.21 eV. OSCs based on IDT(BTTh2)2:PC71BM yielded a PCE of 4.25%, one of the high values at that time (Table 1).
The Cao group developed two IDT-based molecules SM1 and SM2, which differ by the substituents on the IDT core. The SM1 molecule with a hexylphenyl side chain has a strong self-aggregation tendency and increases the phase separation in the blend with PC71BM and improves the charge transport compared to an SM2 film as studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Devices based on SM1 and SM2 exhibited PCEs of 4.72 and 1.52%, respectively. Zhan and co-workers prepared a DPP-based bipolar molecule (IDT-2DPP), which showed a strong absorption at around 650 nm. An IDT-2DPP:PC71BM-based device yielded the best PCE of 2.82% after thermal annealing (TA) treatment. The authors further reported four molecular donors, IDT2T-CA, IDT3T-CA, IDT2T-R, and IDT3T-R by varying the spacer and terminal acceptor groups. These molecules showed relatively low lying HOMO energy levels and broad absorption. Using PC71BM as an acceptor, a higher PCE of 5.32% was reported for the IDT3T-R donor containing rhodanine termini. The hole mobility was found to be improved upon extending the π-bridges from bithiophene to terthiophene and IDT3T-R showed the highest value.
The Jen group prepared a series of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT)-based oligomers and studied the influence of π-bridges and fluorine-substitution on solar cell performance. A strong correlation between the increasing end group dipole moment and FF could be established. The end group dipole moment was the lowest for the difluorobenzothiazole (DFBT)-derivative and concomitantly increased from TT to BT to 3T terminal units. The IDTT-FBT-3T molecule with the highest end group dipole moment when blended with PC71BM gave the maximum PCE of 6.5% without any solvent additive or thermal/solvent annealing treatment.
Bäuerle and co-workers reported three A–D–A type S,N-heteropentacene based molecules SN5-1 to SN5-3 by varying the conjugation length of the acceptors. The elongation of the terminal groups by sequentially increasing the acceptor double bonds increased the π-conjugation, red-shifted and broadened the absorption spectra and upshifted the energy levels. When SN5-1 to SN5-3 were implemented as donor materials in OSCs using PC61BM as an acceptor, the PCE increased from 3.1% for SN5-1 to 4.2% for SN5-2 to 4.9% for SN5-3, consistent with the extension of the π-conjugation by the increasing double bonds in the acceptor. It is worth mentioning that the highest PCE of SN5-3 was achieved without any additive treatment; however, the PCEs of SN5-1 and SN5-2 were improved by addition of chloronaphthalene (CN) or diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive. A trade-off between VOC and JSC was observed due to the stepwise reduction in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap by the elongation of double bonds.
The Sharma and Ko group reported three SN5-based molecular donors (SN5-2T-CN, SN5-2T-CA and SN5-2T-IN) comprising different acceptor groups such as dicyanovinyl, cyanoacetate and indenedione, respectively. Using PC71BM as an acceptor the devices generated the highest PCE of 6.64% for the SN5-2T-IN:PC71BM blend using two step annealing, i.e. TA followed by solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The PCEs for SN5-2T-CN and SN5-2T-CA were slightly lower (5.64% and 4.24%) due to their lower JSC and FF. The device based on SN5-2T-IN showed a higher VOC, which is attributed to its low lying HOMO energy level.

The progress of FFAs provided a new direction to the field of OSCs and a significant number of new molecules with diverse optoelectronic properties have been designed and developed. The challenges to achieve high performance >10%, efficient charge transport pathways, complementary absorption for higher photocurrent and lowering of Eloss for high photovoltages have been overcome with FFAs and have widened the research direction compared to fullerenes. Another aspect of FFAs is the strong π–π interactions between their electron accepting end groups and/or with the donor polymers/oligomers in thin films, enabling efficient charge transport pathways, which have been demonstrated by density functional theory calculation. The design concepts of various n-type A–D–A and A–π–D–π–A molecular semiconductors and their application in OSCs are discussed. Due to their tunable absorption properties (500 to 1100 nm) and molecular energy level alignments, many highly efficient FFAs have been designed and synthesized. Fig. 6 presents the absorption spectra and energy levels of some selected heteroacene-based high performance FFAs, showing how structural tuning can change the absorption and energetics (structures shown in the subsequent sections). The structures of polymer donors are shown in Fig. 7 and 8. It is important to mention here that many new polymeric/oligomeric donor molecules have also been developed to make them compatible with FFAs.


IDT was also found to be an excellent building block to develop A–π–D–π–A type molecular acceptors. The first molecular acceptor (DC-IDT2T) using an IDT core and strong electron-withdrawing 3-dicyanomethyleneindan-1-one (DCI) terminal units was synthesized by Zhan and co-workers using the Stille-type cross-coupling reaction followed by a Knoevenagel condensation (Scheme 1). The hexylphenyl side chains in the IDT core remain twisted from the molecular backbone with a dihedral angle of ∼115° in order to impede the aggregation. DC-IDT2T displayed a strong absorption at ∼725 nm and the optical gap (Eoptg) estimated from thin film was 1.55 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DC-IDT2T were −5.43 eV and −3.85 eV respectively. A blend of the DC-IDT2T acceptor and the PBDTTT-C-T donor achieved a PCE of 3.93% without any post-treatment (Table 2).

Thereafter, the IDT core turned out to be a useful building block to prepare many new molecular acceptors (Fig. 9). The molecular properties of IDT-based molecules can be tuned by variation of different acceptor groups, such as dicyanovinyl (DCV) and 3-ethylrhodanine substituted with benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT). For example, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of IDT-2BM and IDT-2Br were −5.60 eV/−3.80 eV and −5.52 eV/−3.69 eV, the absorption bands were at 688 and 658 nm and the optical bandgaps were 1.60 eV and 1.68 eV, respectively. OSCs using the PBDTTT-C-T:IDT-2BM blend achieved a PCE of 4.26%. Using P3HT as a donor, the PCE of an IDT-2BR-based device was improved to 5.12%, a higher value than that of a P3HT:PC61BM based device (3.63%). Replacement of hexylphenyl side chains of the IDT-core with linear n-alkyl chains to form IDT-2BR1 and O-IDTBR and branched alkyl chains to form EH-IDTBR red-shifted the absorption bands (690 and 673 nm, respectively), suggesting stronger molecular aggregation in the solid state. PCEs of 6.3% and 6.0% were achieved for P3HT:O-IDTBR and P3HT:EH-IDTBR devices after TA treatment at 130 °C. Using the low band gap polymer PffBT4T-2DT, the PCE of the O-IDTBR-based device was further enhanced to 9.95% with a VOC to 1.07 V and an Eloss of 0.55 eV. The hexyl-substituted IDT-2BR1 when paired with PTB7-Th yielded a PCE of 8.7%, which is higher than that of the corresponding IDT-2BR device (7.7%). The electron mobility of 2.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDT-2BR1 was also an order of magnitude higher than that (3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) for IDT-2BR.
The introduction of electronegative fluorine atoms in IFBR and IFFBR further lowered the HOMO/LUMO energetics (−5.69/−3.64 eV and −5.71/−3.77 eV, respectively). Both molecules absorb at 670 and 658 nm in thin films and are complementary to the PBTA-BO polymer. PBTA-BO:IFBR and PBTA-BO:IFFBR based OSCs using PEDOT:PSS as a hole selective layer and PFN-Br as an electron transport layer exhibited PCEs of 3.85% and 6.34%, respectively.
Insertion of the thiophene unit into the benzothiadiazole in IDT-BTT1 and IDT-BTT2 increases the quinoid population and strengthens the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. The dicyanomethylene substitution in IDT-BTT2 further enhances the ICT effect and makes the quinoid structure more stable. Therefore, red-shifts of the absorption band to 785 and 770 nm and lowering of the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were observed relative to IDT-2Br. In OSCs, after blending PTB7-Th with IDT-BTT1 and IDT-BTT2, respectively, PCEs of 5.79% and 9.07% could be reached.
To improve the solubility for solution-processing, alkyl chains were introduced at the thiophene rings in IEIC. A blend of PTB7-Th and IEIC achieved a higher PCE of 6.31% using a perylenediimide derivative (PDIN) as a cathode interface layer (CIL) relative to the Ca-counterpart (5.24%) (Fig. 10). The use of PDIN can also lower the work function of the electrode and improve charge transport. Compared to IEIC with alkyl side chains on thiophene units, the IEICO acceptor with alkoxy chains exhibited red-shifted absorption and up-shifted the HOMO energy level. A PCE of 8.4% was obtained for a device based on the PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO blend relative to 4.9% achieved for a PBDTTT-E-T:IEIC based device owing to its improved JSC and FF. Moreover, a high VOC of 0.82 V and Eloss of 0.52 eV were measured despite its bandgap of 1.34 eV. The increased JSC and FF for the PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO-based device were due to the higher exciton dissociation and charge transfer probability (Pdiss) of 83% than that (only 60%) obtained for the PBDTTT-E-T:IEIC-based device.
Many of the molecular acceptors are amorphous and highly miscible with polymer donors, offering poor morphologies in thin films. Therefore, to obtain better phase separation, regulating the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor would be highly effective. For example, it has been realized that in the case of a PBDB-T:PC61BM based device the PCE was improved mainly due to the temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) of the PBDB-T polymer, which enhanced the phase separation forming appropriate domain size in the blend (Fig. 11a). The temperature-dependent color change is also found to be reversible. A similar TDA tendency was reported for the fluorinated polymer PffT2-FTAZ-2DT, whose absorption was broadened and red-shifted from 486 nm at 100 °C to a structured absorption with two peaks at 570 and 624 nm at 40 °C due to its strong aggregation upon cooling (Fig. 11b), which is similar to the absorption in thin film. The results demonstrate that the disordered polymer chains in solution have a strongly aggregated geometry at low temperature and favor phase separation with the FFAs. An inverted device using complementary absorbing acceptor IEIC with ZnO as an ETL and V2O5 as an HTL gave a PCE of 7.3%, despite its small ΔEHOMO of 0.17 eV. Furthermore, the balanced mobility (μh/μe = 1.1) of PffT2-FTAZ-2DT:IEIC blend played an important role in reducing bimolecular recombination and buildup space charge density.
In order to ensure compatibility with fluorinated polymer PBDTTT-EF-T (commonly known as PTB7-Th), Hou and co-workers used IEICO-4F as an acceptor with a LUMO energy level of −4.19 eV. IEICO-4F showed a strong absorption at 881 nm tailing up to 1000 nm with an exceptionally low bandgap of 1.24 eV. A PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based conventional OSC afforded a PCE of 10.0% with a JSC of 22.8 mAcm−2. The IEICO-4F acceptor when combined with PBDTTT-E-T, J52, PBDB-T and PBDTS-DTBTO polymers with bandgaps ranging from 1.55 to 1.77 eV also maintained a high JSC of over 20 mAcm−2. An impressive JSC of 27.3 mAcm−2 and PCE of 12.8% were achieved in an PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based inverted device by optimizing the blend morphology using 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive. CN plays a crucial role in increasing the face-on orientation as studied by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).
When 80% ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) was used as a low work function CIL processed from aqueous solution (to increase the protonation), the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based device generated an impressive PCE of 13.2% as compared to 12.6% for ZnO as an ETL. When PEIE processed from isopropanol, ethanol and methanol was used, the PCE decreased to <10%. The results demonstrated that the amine in PEIE can protonate in water due to the increased dipole moment of the polar protic solvent and enhance the charge collection efficiency at the electrode. Earlier it was shown that PEIE spin-coated from isopropanol reacts strongly with the ITIC acceptor and destroys its chemical structure, thus reducing the overall PCE of 7.1% to 3.3% after TA treatment. It was proposed that the amine groups present in PEIE attack the CC linkage between D and A units and disrupt the ICT process. The color of the solution changes from blue to brown after addition of PEIE with a spectral shift from 750 nm to about 450 nm in chlorobenzene solution. A flexible OSC was also fabricated using aqueous PEIE and gave an excellent PCE of 12.5% without TA.
When the oxygen atoms of the alkoxy groups were replaced with sulphur atoms to form IEICS-4F (also called ACS8), the bandgap increased to 1.3 eV with a blue-shifted absorption (50 nm) compared to IEICO-4F. IEICS-4F showed an improved electron mobility of 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to IEICO-4F (1.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and ordered π–π stacking. Inverted OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IEICS-4F yielded a higher PCE of 13.2% with a JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2.
When the thiophene spacer was replaced with thiazole units to form IDTTz, the backbone planarity increased due to the N⋯S non-covalent interaction. When blended with PTB7-Th, IDTTz and DC-IDT2T yielded PCEs of 8.4% and 4.1%, respectively. The larger ΔELUMO (0.28 eV) for PTB7-Th/IDTTz relative to 0.15 eV for PTB7-Th/DC-IDT2T led to efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, while a reduction in VOC was ascribed to the decrease in the HOMOdonor/LUMOacceptor offset. Huang and co-workers reported an increased PCE of 8.71% for the thiazole-bridged acceptor IDTzCR relative to 6.1% for the thiophene counterpart IDTCR using PTB7-Th as a donor. The relatively higher JSC and FF values for PTB7-Th:IDTzCR were due to the increased ΔELUMO (0.11 eV) vs. 0.01 eV for PTB7-Th:IDTCR. The Eloss values were ∼0.46 eV and 0.43 eV. Liu et al. introduced intramolecular noncovalent O⋯H and S⋯O interactions by introducing alkoxy chains on the benzene ring to prepare molecular acceptor IDT-BOC6. The conformational locking reduced the dihedral angles to 9° and 1° for IDT-BOC6, whereas the dihedral angles are 47° and 36° for the alkylated counterpart IDT-BC6. The improved coplanarity in IDT-BOC6 resulted in a 96 nm red-shift of the absorption band and reduced nonradiative energy loss compared to IDT-BC6. As a result, a PCE of 9.6% was observed for a PBDB-T:IDT-BOC6 based device, relative to 2.3% obtained for PBDB-T:IDT-BC6 without a planar conformation. The locking of the molecular conformation was further implemented by introducing alkoxythiophene between the IDT core and terminal acceptors. The terminal F atoms promote supramolecular electrostatic interactions by intermolecular π–π stacking. Blends of ITOIC, ITOIC-F and ITOIC-2F with the PBDB-T donor achieved PCEs of 8.87, 10.65 and 12.2% respectively. The high performance for the latter devices was due to the more planar structure of ITOIC-2F and strong electrostatic interaction. The values are quite high compared to 3.93% for the parent acceptor DC-IDT2T. Using a similar strategy of conformational locking, IDT-EDOT and IDT-PDOT were prepared, which showed PCEs of 11.32% and 2.18%, respectively, with the PBDB-T donor. The higher performance of IDT-EDOT was attributed to its high molar absorption coefficient and high charge mobilities caused by its closer π–π-stacking.
The Zhu group introduced a thienothiophene spacer in ATT-1 and ATT-2 and studied the influence of terminal acceptor units. A strong red-shift was observed for ATT-2 containing the DCI acceptor (λmax = 835 nm, Eoptg = 1.32 eV) compared to ATT-1 (λmax = 736 nm, Eoptg =1.54 eV) with rhodanine as terminal units. OSCs with a PTB7-Th:ATT-1 based device afforded a PCE of 10.07%; however, the overlap absorption of PTB7-Th and ATT-1 limits the light absorption range. Inverted OSCs with ATT-1 and ATT-2 delivered PCEs of 5.69% and 9.58%, respectively. The VOC of the ATT-2 device (0.73 V) was lowered compared to the ATT1-based device (0.92 V), which resulted from the difference in LUMO energy levels.
Chen and co-workers synthesized an A–π–D–π–A-type molecular acceptor (IDT-FBTR) in which the π-bridge consisting of a monofluoro-substituted benzothiadiazole–thiophene conjugate connected between the IDT core and dicyanorhodanine terminal acceptor. The introduction of the thiophene donor and F acceptor at the benzothiadiazole unit balances the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (−5.47 and −3.65 eV, respectively) of the molecule in order to maintain high VOC and good charge transport. The molecule showed a broad intramolecular charge-transfer absorption band in the range from 500 to 750 nm with an Eg of 1.67 eV. The PTB7-Th:IDT-FBTR based inverted device with 5.5% CN as a solvent additive exhibited a PCE of 9.14% with a high VOC of 1.02 V, resulting in an Eloss of 0.56 eV.

The Zhan group prepared the IDT-based acceptor IDIC (named IC-C6IDT-IC) (Fig. 12) with a high electron mobility of 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The as-cast inverted device based on PDBT-T1:IDIC exhibited a PCE of 8.71%. A Pdiss of ∼79% for the device indicated efficient charge dissociation and collection at the respective electrodes. An OSC using the medium band gap polymer FTAZ and the IDIC acceptor showed a PCE of 12.5% compared to ∼6% for an FTAZ:PC61BM control device, suggesting efficient generation of charge carriers in the former device. Using the PDBT-T1 polymer, the IDIC-based inverted OSC gave a PCE of 9.2%. In contrast, the hexylphenyl-substituted IDT-IC acceptor with the PDBT-T1 polymer resulted in a PCE of 7.39%. However, the VOC of the IDIC device (0.85 V) was lower than that of the IDT-IC device (0.92 V), which was assigned to the difference in their LUMO energy levels (Table 2).

In most of the device optimizations, one or two steps of annealing and solvent additive methods can be employed to modulate the morphology. Ma and co-workers showed that the crystallinity of an acceptor can be improved without altering the domain size by employing the in situ solvent vapor annealing during spin-coating (SC-SVA) method. The method was successfully demonstrated for PTZ1:IDIC blends resulting in a PCE of 10.1%, higher than that of the as cast device. The SC-SVA treatment resulted in a face-on orientation of the D/A in thin film, and thus improved charge transport.
Bo and co-workers demonstrated the effect of asymmetrical substituents in the IDT-OB acceptor on the device performance. When PBDB-T was blended with IDT-OB, the PCE was enhanced to 10.12% relative to symmetrical IDT-2B-based (6.42%) and IDIC8-M-based (9.68%) devices. The asymmetric substituent improved the solubility and molecular packing, and thus red-shifted the absorption in thin film and balanced charge mobility (μh/μe = 1.3 for IDT-OB vs. 4.03 for IDT-2B and 1.4 for IDIC8-M) in the blend. GIWAXS studies revealed a face-on orientation for PBDB-T:IDT-OB blends, favorable for charge transport. In contrast, in the PBDB-T:IDT-2B blend a face-on orientation co-exists with the edge-on crystallite phase.
Apart from the central fused-core and terminal acceptor units, the substituted alkyl chains also played a major role in the device performance. For example, the hexyl- and hexylphenyl-substituents in IDIC and IDT-IC have a strong influence in modulating the molecular ordering and morphology of the BHJ layer. The presence of the phenyl ring close to the backbone suppressed the molecular aggregation and blue-shifted the absorption and lowered the HOMO level compared to IDIC. However, the major problem with IDIC is its enhanced crystallinity and strong intermolecular interactions. To overcome this problem, the Yang group prepared IDIC-C4Ph by introducing a phenyl substituent at the tail of the alkyl side chain to find a balance between the crystallinity and miscibility. IDIC-C4Ph and IDIC exhibited similar absorption profiles and energetics, but a different molecular packing in the blend. Inverted devices using the PBDB-T donor and IDT-IC, IDIC and IDIC-C4Ph acceptors generated PCEs of 6.1%, 10.4% and 11.5%, respectively, using PDINO as an ETL. This improvement is mainly due to the enhanced photocurrent and FF (0.58 to 0.74 to 0.77). Using the PBDB-TF (also called PM6) donor, the PCE of an IDIC-C4Ph-based device increased to 14.04% with a high FF of 0.78 after TA treatment at 130 °C for 30 s.
In a strategy to increase the conjugation length of end groups and simultaneously to enhance the intermolecular π–π interaction, Hou and co-workers prepared the IDTN acceptor by replacing the terminal benzene ring in IDT-IC with the naphthalene group. IDTN showed more ordered packing and stronger aggregation, and thus an order of magnitude higher electron mobility and lower LUMO energy level than IDT-IC. By using the PBDB-TF donor, the device generated a PCE of 12.2% with an exceptional FF of 0.78, relative to 7.4% and 0.57 for IDT-IC. Although the hole mobilities were nearly the same, the electron mobility was enhanced by two orders of magnitude for IDTN in the blend, suggesting ordered packing and higher domain purity.

Zhan and co-workers prepared the ITIC acceptor by formylation followed by Knoevenagel condensation of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IT) units (Scheme 2). ITIC showed a strong absorption at 702 nm with an Eoptg of 1.59 eV in thin film. The device based on the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend yielded a PCE of 6.8% without any post-treatment and was the first reported high performance for FFAs (Table 3). The PCE of the PTB7-Th:ITIC device was further enhanced to 7.51% by employing SC-SVA treatment, which was higher than those of the as cast and post-SVA treated devices. Since then, ITIC has been successfully tested with several wide bandgap polymers in BHJSCs. Replacement of F-atoms with Cl-atoms in PBTCl polymer resulted in a blue-shift of the absorption and lowering of the HOMO energy level. The PBTCl:ITIC blend produced a face-on orientation with individual crystalline domains with a PCE of 7.57% and a high VOC of 0.91 V, compared to PTB7-Th (6.62%, 0.81 V). The choice of polymer donor was found to be very important for performance improvement. For example, the absorption bands of ITIC and PTB7-Th show strong overlap. However, with the wide bandgap polymer PBT-S-TTz (Eoptg = 1.95 eV), the ITIC acceptor demonstrated a PCE of 8.22%. Another complementary absorbing polymer donor (PBDTS-DTBTO) (Eoptg = 1.76 eV) containing the benzothiadiazole unit and ITIC exhibited an improved PCE of 9.09% after TA treatment using a conventional cell structure with PFN-Br as an ETL. The TA treatment enhanced the face-on orientation with out-of plane π–π stacking confirmed by GIWAXS measurement. A further improvement to 11.21% was observed for an inverted device with the PBDB-T:ITIC blend with DIO as a solvent additive.

A subtle change in the polymer backbone significantly alters the device performance. For example, an optimized PCE of 10.16% was obtained for the alkylester substituted polymer PDCBT when blended with ITIC relative to the P3HT:ITIC blend with 1.25%. The installation of an ester functionality onto the thiophene backbone in PDCBT stabilizes both the HOMO and LUMO energies by about 0.25 eV, which matched well with those of the ITIC acceptor. The enhancement was further assigned to the face-on orientation with the formation of a nanofibrillar network structure for the PDCBT:ITIC film upon TA treatment, beneficial for charge transport in the vertical direction, while the P3HT:ITIC film resulted in a uniform surface morphology. The change from the edge-on packing in the neat film to a face-on packing in the blend for PDCBT could be because of the intramolecular dipole–dipole interactions via CO⋯S and intermolecular CO⋯N interactions with ITIC.
The fluorinated polymer J51 with a bandgap of 1.94 eV when blended with the ITIC acceptor produced a PCE of 9.26%, while its non-fluorinated counterpart J50 gave a PCE of only 4.8%. The more balanced μe/μh value of 1.15 for J51:ITIC relative to J50:ITIC (2.86) mainly accounted for the suppression of the bimolecular recombination and improved the FF to 0.69 from 0.53 for J50. The alkyl substituents on the polymer backbone in J52, J60 and J61 were found to significantly influence the solar cell performance. An OSC based on the J61:ITIC blend produced a PCE of 9.53%, which is much higher than those of J60:ITIC- (8.97%) and J52:ITIC-based (5.51%) devices after TA treatment at 100 °C. The results further supported the higher Eloss for the J52-based device (0.83 eV) compared to the J60 (0.68 eV) and J61 (0.65 eV) devices. Polymer J71 with trialkylsilyl substituents when blended with the ITIC acceptor demonstrated a PCE of 11.41% with high VOC and JSC and an Eloss of 0.65 eV. The hole transport efficiency from ITIC to J71 improved significantly despite the low ΔHOMO of 0.11 eV.
A strong TDA tendency at low temperature was observed in the fluorine-substituted PBDD4T-2F polymer. At 90 °C, polymers PBDD4T without the F-atom and PBDD4T-2F exhibited similar absorption profiles with maxima around 490 nm. When the temperature decreased to −10 °C, the fluorinated polymer PBDD4T-2F displayed a strong peak at 590 nm with a shoulder at 640 nm compared to a broad structureless peak at 520 nm for PBDD4T (Fig. 11b and c). GIWAXS analysis revealed a stronger π–π stacking effect for PBDD4T-2F in thin film with a d-spacing of 3.93 Å, showing enhanced crystallinity, compared to the PBDD4T polymer with a d-spacing of 4.19 Å. Inverted OSCs based on PBDD4T:ITIC and PBDD4T-2F:ITIC yielded PCEs of 0.45% and 8.69%, respectively, suggesting that the substitution of fluorine units into the molecular backbone can be an effective strategy to enhance molecular aggregation and improve phase separation in the blend.
Reasonably high PCEs were reported for two 1,3,4-thiadiazole containing wide bandgap polymers PBDT-TDZ (9.43%) and PBDTS-TDZ (12.8%) when blended with ITIC processed from halogen-free solvent (o-xylene). Owing to the low-lying HOMO level of PBDTS-TDZ, a PBDTS-TDZ-based device gave a higher VOC of 1.10 V than a PBDT-TDZ based device (1.02 V).
Yang et al. prepared an isomeric acceptor (m-ITIC) by changing the positions of hexyl-groups from the p- to m-positions of benzene (Fig. 13). Compared to the isomeric ITIC, m-ITIC displayed a stronger absorption and high electron mobility. An OSC based on J61:m-ITIC exhibited an enhanced PCE of 11.77% relative to 10.6% for an ITIC device, which is ascribed to the balanced charge mobility in the device (μh/μe = 1.18 for J61:m-ITIC vs. 1.97 for J61:ITIC). The J61:m-ITIC blend displayed a stronger diffraction peak with an enhanced face-on orientation than J61:ITIC as studied by GIWAXS (Fig. 14).
Insertion of hexyl chains at the terminal thiophenes of IT in ITC6-IC can lock the conformation of the terminal DCI acceptors and elevate the LUMO energy level to −3.92 eV, resulting in a higher VOC of 0.97 V vs. 0.91 V for an ITIC-based device (ITICLUMO = −4.01 eV). As a result, PBDB-T:ITC6-IC and PBDB-T:ITIC based inverted OSCs generated PCEs of 10.45% and 10.21%, respectively. The PCE of the optimized device upon TA treatment at 125 °C reached 11.61% along with a high FF of 0.73 due to the formation of a fibrillar bicontinuous network and balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.36).
Song et al. reported two fused ring acceptors, IDTIC and IDTTIC containing hexadecyl chains. Compared to IDTIC, IDTTIC exhibited stronger absorption, a smaller optical bandgap, and enhanced intramolecular interactions due to its longer fused thienothiophene unit. An inverted device with PBDB-T:IDTTIC showed a PCE of 11.2%, which was significantly higher than that of an IDTIC-based device (PCE = 5.67%). This PCE enhancement was ascribed to the enhanced molecular packing, reduced trap-assisted recombination and higher domain purity of the PBDB-T:IDTTIC blend, which enhanced the JSC and FF. The electron mobility of IDTTIC, measured using an OFET, was 0.50 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to 0.15 cm2 V−1 s−1 for IDTIC.
The material properties, film morphology and device performance are considerably influenced by the types, positions, and lengths of lateral substituents. Substitution of hexylphenyl chains in ITIC with hexylthienyl chains in ITIC-Th lowers the HOMO/LUMO energy levels due to the more polarized sulfur atoms and the σ-inductive effect of thienyl groups. The electron mobility was found to be almost double compared to ITIC. The PTB7-Th/ITIC-Th and PDBT-T1/ITIC-Th blends displayed PCEs of 8.7% and 9.6%, respectively, using CN as an SA. The terminal acceptor groups in ITIC-Th were further modified by introducing electron withdrawing F or electron donating methoxy groups in each unit. The electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptors increased from methoxylated to unsubstituted, fluorinated, and difluorinated groups, leading to a lowering of energy levels and a red-shift of absorption spectra. Optimized OSCs based on the FTAZ donor and ITIC-Th1, ITIC-Th2 and ITIC-Th3 exhibited PCEs of 12.1%, 9.06% and 10.7%, respectively, which is higher than that of an FTAZ:ITIC-Th device (8.8%). Interestingly, due to its higher LUMO level, ITIC-Th3 showed a high VOC of 0.96 V compared to 0.85 V for ITIC-Th1 and 0.75 V for ITIC-Th2. All the ITIC-Th derivatives showed excellent FFs in the range of 0.68 to 0.74.
To achieve PCEs >10%, it is very crucial to choose a matching polymer donor and FFA pair. For example, polymers PTFB-O and PTFB-P that exhibit very similar TDA behaviors showed different device performances. An OSC with the PTFB-O donor and ITIC acceptor gave a PCE of 10.13%, while the PTFB-P:ITIC blend achieved a PCE of only 7.85%. The PTFB-O polymer with o-substituted F-atoms exhibited weaker lamellar stacking and lower crystallinity relative to the PTFB-P polymer.
Zhan and co-workers reported an octafused molecule (FOIC) with strong absorption in the near-IR region at 836 nm and a high lying HOMO energy level compared to ITIC3 with a benzene core. When FOIC was blended with the PTB7-Th donor, the device displayed a PCE of 12.0% with an Eloss of 0.58 eV. A similar device using the ITIC3 acceptor with a lower HOMO level generated a rather smaller PCE of 8.1% with low JSC and FF values.
In search of molecular acceptors with high dielectric constants (εr), Cao and co-workers prepared ITIC-OE by introducing oxyethylene side chains in the heteroacene core. ITIC-OE displayed an εr of ∼9.4 compared to ∼4.5 for ITIC. It is known that materials with high εr reduce the exciton binding energy and improve charge separation. However, this strategy turned out to be detrimental when the PBDB-T polymer was blended with ITIC-OE, resulting in a PCE of 8.5%, a lower value than that of an ITIC device (10.4%) because of the unbalanced μh/μe ratio of 28.9 relative to 1.0 for the PBDB-T:ITIC blend.
Li and co-workers reported hydroxyl-functionalized acceptors IT-OH and IT-DOH, which formed intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the –OH group and –CO groups, leading to long-range ordered molecular ordering and higher crystallinity compared to ITIC. The introduction of hydroxyl groups red-shifted the absorption band, increased the molar absorptivity and lowered the Eoptg. OSCs based on PBDB-T:IT-OH and PBDB-T:IT-DOH exhibited PCEs of 10.4 and 11.0%, respectively, compared to 7.8% obtained for PBDB-T:ITIC without any annealing. The PCE for PBDB-T:IT-DOH was further improved to 12.5% with a VOC of 0.96, a FF of 0.73 and an Eloss of 0.57 eV using PBDB-TF as the donor. In comparison to ITIC, the IT-OH and IT-DOH-based blend films showed characteristic fibrillar networks with a face-on orientation favorable for exciton dissociation and charge transport.

The variation of terminal acceptor groups in A–D–A oligomers is another strategy to tune the energy level to improve the VOC and JSC of OSCs. The introduction of Me-groups at the terminal DCI units in IT-M and IT-DM shifted the absorption to higher energy and up-shifted the LUMO levels compared to the ITIC acceptor which is beneficial to increase VOC (Fig. 15). Employing 1% DIO as an additive, inverted OSCs based on the PBDB-T donor and IT-M and IT-DM acceptors afforded PCEs of 12.1 and 11.3%, respectively. The data are presented in Table 4.

Polymers are often processed using chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform or chlorobenzene, due to their poor solubility and aggregation tendencies in polar or non-chlorinated solvents. In order to improve the solubility in non-chlorinated solvent, Hou and co-workers developed two polymers PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT, by replacing 2-ethylhexyl chains in PBDB-T with 2-butyloctyl chains. The polymers showed a weak TDA tendency in THF, but a strong tendency in chlorobenzene. The surface roughness values were studied by AFM and were 58, 0.8 and 2.1 nm for PBDB-T, PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT, respectively. The THF-processed devices with PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT as donors and IT-M as an acceptor gave PCEs of 10.8 and 12.1%, respectively. However, the PBDB-T based device which showed the highest PCE of 11.74% when processed from chlorobenzene gave a PCE of only 6.41% when processed from THF because of severe phase separation due to its strong aggregation tendency.
Hou and co-workers synthesized ITCC and ITCC-M acceptors containing thiophene- and α-methylthiophene-fused indanone terminal units, respectively, which displayed closer intermolecular packing and blue-shifted absorption compared to ITIC. The melding of the thiophene unit with the acceptor block elevated the LUMO energy level to −3.76 eV for ITCC and −3.67 eV for ITCC-M, which when combined with PBDB-T led to a higher VOC of 1.01 V (PCE = 11.4%) and 1.03 V (PCE = 10.1%), respectively, than ITIC (VOC = 0.93 V, PCE = 10.6%).
The 3,4-thiophene-fused acceptor ITTC which showed a red-shifted absorption and elevated HOMO/LUMO energy levels compared to ITIC achieved a PCE of 10.4% and a FF of 0.71 with HFQx-T as the donor after TA treatment. Using the polymer PBT1-EH the device gave a PCE of 11.8% and an excellent FF of 0.75, which are higher than those of the PBT1-EH:ITIC device (PCE = 9.8%, FF = 0.63) due to optimal phase separation and balanced charge transport. By further optimization of the morphology using the medium molecular weight polymer PBT1-C, a higher PCE of 12.8% and a remarkable FF of 0.79 were achieved.
The insertion of fluorine atoms onto terminal benzene rings of ITIC gave the IT-4F acceptor with down-shifted HOMO/LUMO energy levels. An inverted OSC using the fluorinated polymer PBDB-T-SF recorded a PCE of 13.1% (JSC = 20.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.88 V and FF = 0.72) with an Eloss of 0.66 eV and even over 12% upon varying the thickness from 100 to 200 nm. The interlayer materials used in these devices also played a crucial role in performance improvement. The ester-functionalized polymer PDTB-EF-T with a low-lying HOMO energy level (−5.5 eV) was tested in both conventional and inverted OSCs using IT-4F as the acceptor, which delivered impressive PCEs of 13.0% and 14.2% with FF values of 0.71 and 0.77, respectively.
A conventional OSC with the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend exhibited a PCE of 13.7% with an excellent FF of 0.77 compared to 10.5% (FF = 0.65) recorded in PBDB-TF:IT-M-based devices. A trade-off between the JSC and VOC was observed by replacing IT-4F with IT-M as an acceptor. When the fluorine atoms of the PBDB-TF polymer were replaced with Cl atoms in PBDB-TCl polymer, the HOMO energy level of the polymer donor was down-shifted from −5.47 eV to −5.51 eV. Both polymers showed similar TDA behavior with an absorption band of 530 nm at 120 °C to 610 nm with a shoulder at 570 nm at room temperature and below, which is an important parameter for nanoscale phase separation. Inverted solar cells prepared using PBDB-TF:IT-4F and PBDB-TCl:IT-4F achieved PCEs of 13.2 and 14.4%, respectively, showing the importance of Cl-atoms on the device performance.
Hou and co-workers achieved an excellent PCE of 14.7% using a TDA polymer PTO2 and IT-4F blend despite its small driving force for charge generation and separation. The TDA spectra indicated a strong aggregation effect in chlorobenzene solution with color change from red to yellow upon increasing the temperature (Fig. 11d). On the other hand, the PTO2:PC71BM device gave a PCE of only 5.0% due to its low JSC and FF. Theoretical studies revealed a larger molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and intermolecular electric field (IEF) between PTO2 and IT-4F than those between PTO2 and PC71BM. Transient absorption studies revealed that the large ESP between PTO2 and IT-4F might be favorable for preventing the long-lived loosely bound excitons and impeding the charge carrier recombination.
Temperature-dependent shift in the absorption was also observed for the carbonyl containing twisted polymer PBDT-3TCO compared to the polymer PBDT-3T without the CO group (Fig. 11e and f). This strong TDA behavior was ascribed to the intra-/inter-molecular S⋯O and O⋯H interactions in solution at low temperature (i.e. 10 °C). At 100 °C both polymers PBDT-3T and PBDT-3TCO have very similar absorption profiles with a λmax of 467 and 473 nm, respectively. After gradual cooling to 10 °C, the λmax of PBDT-3TCO exhibited a significant red-shift (550 nm) compared with that of PBDT-3T (490 nm). The absorption maximum of PBDT-3TCO at low temperature resembles the absorption band in thin films (552 nm). On the other hand, PBDT-3T without S⋯O and O⋯H interactions cannot acquire intermolecular interaction in solution at 10 °C. Thus, a 22 nm red-shift was observed for PBDT-3T going from solution (at 10 °C) to film. OSCs with PBDT-3T:IT-4F blend film gave a PCE of only 1.0% due to poor phase separation and formation of clusters. In contrast, the PCE was significantly enhanced to 11.8% for PBDT-3TCO:IT-4F based device due to the formation of good nanoscale bicontinuous phase separation, high domain purity, suitable domain size and effective charge extraction.
Hao et al. substituted both –Me and –F groups on the terminal DCI block in ITCF and obtained three inseparable isomers. The introduction of the –Me group raises the LUMO energy level, which could improve the VOC, and the –F unit lowers the bandgap to enhance the JSC value. Using the J71 polymer as a donor and ITCF as an acceptor, the OSC generated a PCE of 13.25%, which is significantly higher compared to the IT-DM (12.05%) and IT-4F (11.66%) acceptors. Although the VOC and JSC values of the ITCF-based device were in between those of the IT-DM and IT-4F devices, the FF value was greatly improved to 0.79 for the ITCF-based device. This high FF was mainly due to the improved charge dissociation and collection efficiencies of the ITCF acceptor (97.8 and 91.1%) in comparison to IT-DM (95.0% and 80.5%) and IT-4F (96.3% and 88.1%) as well as its more favorable morphology.
To improve the VOC, N-ethylthiabarbituric acid terminal groups were introduced in IDTT-T. In comparison to ITIC, the weaker acceptor groups in IDTT-T blue-shifted the absorption and raised the LUMO level. When IDTT-T was paired with PTB7-Th, both ΔEDA and absorption spectral coverage were simultaneously enhanced. The IDTT-T:PTB7-Th based inverted device offered a PCE of 9.2% (VOC = 1.01 V) higher than the values obtained for the ITIC based device (PCE = 8.0%, VOC = 0.82 V).
The Chen group synthesized two acceptors FDICTF and FDICTF-M with a fluorine-fused core, which in BHJ solar cells with the PBDB-T donor achieved PCEs of 10.1% and 10.3% respectively. The higher VOC of FDICTF-M (0.98 V) compared to FDICTF (0.94 V) indicates a decrease in Eloss from 0.69 to 0.67 eV. When the terminal benzene ring in FDICTF was replaced with the naphthyl group to form FDNCTF, the absorption was red-shifted and the packing was enhanced in the solid state. The OSC using the PBDB-T donor achieved a higher PCE of 11.2% with simultaneous increases in JSC and FF without altering the VOC, which resulted from the efficient charge separation (Table 4).
The same group further prepared the NFBDT acceptor (also called ITIC1/BDI-IC/BDCPDT-IC), an isomer of ITIC, by replacing the central benzene ring of IDIC with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, which displays similar absorption and energy levels to ITIC. OSCs based on the PBDB-T:NFBDT blend gave a PCE of 10.42% after SVA treatment from chloroform. The photoluminescence quenching study and high EQE value revealed an efficient hole transfer from NFBDT to PBDB-T even with a small ΔEHOMO of 0.07. Later, the PCE was increased to 11.0% and 10.62% using Me- and F-substituted acceptors NFBDT-M and NFBDT-F combined with the PBDB-T donor. Me-substitution resulted in a higher VOC, while F-groups helped in improving the JSC value. The Forrest group achieved a PCE of 10.5% for a J71:NFBDT blend, relative to 9.0% for a J71:ITIC-based device without any additional treatments. A PCE of 9.33% was achieved for a PBDB-T:BDCPDT-IC-based inverted OSC after TA treatment at 150 °C.
The insertion of octyl chains at the central benzene ring in NCBDT-F raised the HOMO energy level and the insertion of F-atoms at the termini lowered the LUMO level, thus lowering the bandgap to 1.45 eV than that of NFBDT-F (1.50 eV). The absorption band was red-shifted to 760 nm extending down to 860 nm for NCBDT-F compared with that for NFBDT-F (λmax = 743 nm). A PBDB-T:NCBDT-F-based OSC with PDINO as an ETL achieved a PCE of 12.12%. When the octyl chain in NCBDT-F was replaced with an octyloxy chain to form NOBDT-F, the molecule exhibited a higher HOMO level and red-shifted absorption. The PTB7-Th:NOBDT-F blend after SVA treatment yielded a PCE of 10.55% with a lower VOC of 0.77 V.
Liao and co-workers introduced branched 2-ethylhexyloxy chains in a BDT core to synthesize BT-IC. Despite the small ΔEHOMO of 0.1 eV, the pairing of BT-IC with the J61 and J71 polymers displayed efficient charge transport and correspondingly obtained high VOC values of 0.87 V and 0.90 V and PCEs of 9.6% and 10.6% respectively.
The Zhan group designed the FFA ITIC2 by introducing 2-ethylhexylthienyl side chains at the central benzene ring. The molecule exhibited red-shifted absorption and slightly higher energy levels and higher μe compared with those of NFBDT. BHJ devices prepared using the FTAZ:ITIC2 and FTAZ:NFBDT blends achieved PCEs of 11.0% and 8.54%, respectively. The installation of 2-ethylhexylthienyl groups onto a BDTThIT-M core elevated the LUMO energy level and achieved a PCE of 12.1% with an Eloss of 0.59 eV using the PBDB-T donor after dual optimization. The higher VOC of 0.94 V for the BDTThIT-M device relative to 0.90 V for the NFBDT-M device was due to its elevated LUMO energy level.
The heptacyclic electron acceptor ITIC5 with thiophene termini (an isomeric structure of ITTC) when blended with the J71 polymer was found to enhance the film crystallinity after TA treatment compared to the annealed J71:NFBDT blend. The red-shifted absorption of ITIC5 was beneficial to enhance the JSC, whereas the increased crystallinity, higher electron mobility and balanced charge transport resulted in a higher FF (0.75). An OSC based on J71:ITIC5 showed a PCE of 12.5%, a nearly 40% enhancement with respect to the NFBDT-based device, suggesting the potential role of thiophene-fused terminal units. Chang et al. reported a new acceptor (BDCPDT-TTC) incorporating thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) fused terminal units which delivered a PCE of 10.3% with high JSC and VOC values compared to the NFBDT acceptor (9.3%) using PBDB-T as the donor. The incorporation of TT units reduced the electron accepting ability of the acceptor and elevated the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and thus reduced the ΔEHOMO, enhanced the VOC and lowered the Eloss. The terminal TTC unit isolated as a mixture of two inseparable regioisomers was used as is. To overcome this problem, the same group synthesized a new acceptor building block by replacing the benzene ring of the DCI unit with benzothiophene, which specifically gives a single isomer, and was successfully used to develop isomerically pure BDCPDT-BC and ITBC molecules. OSCs with the PBDB-T:BDCPDT-BC blend achieved PCEs of 10.82 and 10.73% when processed from chlorobenzene and o-xylene as solvents with high VOCs up to 0.98 V. While using structural isomer ITBC as an acceptor, an enhanced PCE of 12.1% was achieved due to its higher JSC value. For the naphthyl-substituted acceptor NNBDT with an Eg of 1.43 eV when blended with the PBDB-T polymer using DIO as an additive, a PCE of 11.7% and an Eloss of 0.55 eV were achieved.
The attachment of alkyl or alkoxy side chains in IDTT-BH and IDTT-OBH did not influence their absorption and energy levels. However, the OSC performances were significantly different when tested with three different polymers PDCBT, J71 and PBDB-T. IDTT-BH gave better PCEs (11.05% and 10.35%) with PDCBT and J71, while for IDTT-OBH the PCE was higher with the PBDB-T polymer (10.93%), suggesting the importance in the selection of D:A combination in the blend.
Mark and co-workers prepared two isomeric acceptors ITN-C9 and ItzN-C9 and investigated the OSC performance using the PBDB-TF donor. Both the acceptors showed tight molecular packing with π-stacking distances as small as 3.31 Å, while the central IDTT cores were separated by ∼7 Å, suggesting that electron transport primarily occurred through the naphthyl end groups. The OSC with ITN-C9 exhibited a PCE of 9.33% without any post-treatment, while the PCE of ItzN-C9 enhanced from 7.99% to 9.51% when annealed at the acceptor cold crystallization temperature of 200 °C for 5 min. The difference in the performance was mainly due to the different “face-on” orientations studied by GIWAXS.
Despite the ultra-small ΔEHOMO of 0.02 eV between PBDB-T1 and ITTIC, the device generated an excellent PCE of 9.12% with an Eloss of 0.54 eV, showing efficient charge transfer in the device (Fig. 16). The CT process was further supported by PL quenching studies. The Bazan group recently prepared two low bandgap FFAs IOTIC-2F and ITOTIC-2F by introducing alkoxythiophene units as π-bridges. Furthermore, the F atoms on the DCI units and alkoxythiophene counterbalanced the energy levels to minimize the trade-off between VOC and JSC and thus the PCE. The bandgaps were lowered to 1.31 and 1.32 eV, with absorption extending to 950 nm. The PTB7-Th:IOTIC-2F blend in an inverted OSC (2 vol% DIO) resulted in a high JSC of 22 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 12.1%. The high PCE was further supported by a small Eloss of 0.49 eV and efficient charge transport. Additionally, the device showed good visible transparency (52% transmittance from 370 to 740 nm). In contrast, the ITOTIC-2F acceptor with a longer core unit generated a PCE of only 3.7%.

Perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives have proved to be the most important building blocks by exhibiting good electron transport properties, high electron affinity and good thermal stability to act as electron acceptors. Here we discuss only A–D–A type PDI and NDI derivatives connected to fused ring systems. Zhan and co-workers reported an A–D–A type twisted PDI terminated indacenodithiophene (IDT-2PDI) which when used as an electron acceptor with the BDT-2DPP molecular donor achieved an average PCE of 3.12% compared to 2.61% achieved for the P3HT donor (Fig. 17). The photovoltaic data are presented in Table 5.

Considering the good electron transport properties of PDI units, Chen and co-workers designed a new rigid molecular acceptor (FITP) in which the planar heteroacene backbone was fused with two PDI derivatives. FTIP displayed sufficiently lower HOMO/LUMO energy levels than the PTB7-Th donor and complementary absorption, which is beneficial for photon absorption. Consequently, inverted OSCs with the PTB7-Th:FITP blend provided the best PCE of 7.33% with a high VOC of 0.99 V using 2% CN as an additive. Relative to the electron mobility, the hole mobility was slightly increased after treatment with CN, suggesting that the CN helped in increasing the crystallinity and face-on orientation of PTB7-Th and to some extent influencing the orientation of the FITP acceptor.
In order to enhance the electron donating capacity, Yao et al. synthesized a dithienopicenocarbazole (DTPC) highly conjugated core, which when end-capped with fluorinated DCI formed a new molecular acceptor, DTPC-DFIC, with a narrow bandgap of 1.21 eV and a λmax of ∼900 nm. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels were −5.31 eV and −4.1 eV. OSCs prepared using the DTPC-DFIC acceptor and a complementary absorbing PTB7-Th donor achieved a PCE of 10.21% and a low Eloss of 0.45 eV.
Tajima and co-workers prepared the IDT-NTI acceptor based on an IDT core and naphtho[2,3-b]thiophene diimide (NTI) end groups, which has an absorption maximum at around 700 nm. The molecule exhibited strong π–π stacking due to its planar conjugated backbone. In combination with the complementary absorbing PBDB-T polymer the OSC yielded a PCE of 9.07%.

Dai et al. synthesized a library of electron acceptors (F5IC–F11IC) by extending the core from 5 to 11 fused rings (Fig. 18). A systematic red-shift in the absorption, an increase in energy levels and an enhancement of molecular packing were observed upon increasing the core size. The electron mobility significantly increased from 8.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the ring size increased from 5 to 11. OSCs with FTAZ as the donor and F5IC to F9IC fused rings as acceptors demonstrated an increase in the PCE from 5.6 to 11.7% with concomitant increases of the VOC, JSC, and FF. The increase in JSC was also clearly visible in the EQE spectra with broad coverage of the solar spectrum. The photovoltaic data are presented in Table 5.

Zhan and co-workers developed a series of nonafused π-extended acceptor molecules INIC, INIC-2F and INIC-4F. The sequential insertion of F-atoms displayed a red shift of the absorption, lowering of the LUMO level and an increase in electron mobility. When mixed with FTAZ donor, INIC-2F and INIC-4F gave PCEs of 10.8% and 11.5%, which are higher than that of an INIC (7.7%) based device. The VOC was sequentially reduced from 0.96 V for INIC to 0.90 V and 0.86 V for INIC-2F and INIC-4F, respectively. Liao and co-workers synthesized a decacyclic molecule, IDTIDT-IC, and a moderate PCE of 6.5% with an Eloss of 0.59 eV using the PTB7-Th donor was demonstrated. Wu et al. reported a decacyclic IDT-based FFA, m-IDTIDT-FIC, with m-hexylphenyl substitutions which when blended with the complementary absorbing polymers PTB7-Th and J71 yielded PCEs of 8.27% and 11.32%, respectively.
The Marder and Zhan group constructed two isomeric ring-fused molecular acceptors, FNIC1 and FNIC2, containing same terminal groups but different isomeric nonafused cores. These isomeric structures strongly influence the absorption and charge transport properties. In thin films FNIC1 displayed an absorption band at 752 nm, which is 42 nm blue-shifted compared to FNIC2, leading to bandgaps of 1.48 and 1.38 eV, respectively. In comparison to FNIC1, the LUMO energy level is stabilized and the HOMO is destabilized for FNIC2. GIWAXS measurement revealed that FNIC2 possessed higher crystallinity than FNIC1 in the neat film and can co-crystallize with PTB7-Th in blended films, thus exhibiting higher mobilities, enabling increases in JSC and FF. Inverted devices fabricated using PTB7-Th:FNIC2 blends exhibited an excellent PCE of 13.0%, a significantly higher value compared to 10.3% reported for PTB7-Th:FNIC1-based devices. With the improved results of IHIC- and FOIC-based devices, the Zhan group further synthesized a 11-membered ring-fused acceptor (IUIC) exhibiting an extended π-conjugation, an intense red-shifted absorption band at 788 nm and high molecular orbital energy levels (−5.45 eV and −3.87 eV) compared to IT-4F, which is beneficial for higher VOC and improved JSC. Inverted OSCs prepared using PTB7-Th:IUIC without any additional treatment displayed higher VOC and JSC values with a PCE of 11.2% than 8.18% obtained for a PTB7-Th:IT-4F device.
Zhu and co-workers developed an acceptor, ZITI, containing an octacyclic dithienocyclopentaindenoindene central core. The molecule exhibited an absorption maximum at 747 nm with an Eoptg of 1.53 eV. The molecule was found to be compatible with different polymers such as PBDB-T and J71. The optimized PBDBT:ZITI- and J71:ZITI-based devices, in a conventional device using PEDOT:PSS and PNDIT-F3N as the anode and cathode buffer layers, gave excellent PCEs of 13.03 and 13.24%, respectively. The authors further prepared ZITI-S, ZITI-C and ZITI-N with Eoptg of 1.61, 1.47 and 1.41 eV, respectively. The lower Eoptg and red-shifted absorption of ZITI-N were due to the more electron donating pyrrole ring. Using J71 as a donor and ZITI-S, ZITI-C, and ZITI-N as acceptors, PCEs of 9.12%, 13.18% and 13.68% were obtained respectively. The enhanced PCE was mainly due to the increase in JSC and lowering of Eloss from 0.80 to 0.62 to 0.53. Among the three binary blends, the J71:ZITI-N blend had the lowest HOMO offset and a slow hole transport rate. The results also demonstrated that with strong absorption properties and an optimized morphology, the lower HOMO offset was sufficient to realize a good hole transport process. OSCs based on ZITI-S and ZITI-N as acceptors and PTQ10 as a donor exhibited reasonable PCEs of 10.7 and 7.06%, respectively. The lower performance for ZITI-N was mainly due to its lower JSC and FF. Although a positive ΔEHOMO value of 0.2 eV was observed for the PTQ10:ZITI-S blend, the PTQ10:ZITI-N blend revealed a negative ΔEHOMO value of −0.07 eV, which led to poor exciton dissociation and thus lower JSC.

Introduction of nitrogen atoms in a fused ring have known to increase the electron donating ability of the ring. Two nitrogen-fused molecules INPIC and INPIC-4F were synthesized and in combination with the PBDB-T polymer achieved PCEs of 4.31% and 13.1% with DIO as an additive (Fig. 19). The photovoltaic data are given in Table 5. The INPIC-based device generated a high VOC of 0.96 V compared to the INPIC-4F device (0.85 V), while strong bimolecular recombination and poor charge collection efficiency were responsible for the low JSC and FF in the former device, showing the importance of F-atom insertion in the molecule. The authors further showed a PCE improvement from 9.9% to 13.1% when cast on a hot substrate, which resulted from the suppression of the polycrystalline structure of INPIC-4F and increased face-on π–π stacking.

The polycrystalline structure of the FFA in the blend was reduced by replacing hexylphenyl side chains in INPIC-4F with meta- and para-hexyloxyphenyl side chains in p-INPOIC and m-INPOIC respectively. The introduction of alkoxy chains fine-tunes the molecular orientation and π–π stacking in BHJ blends. The as-cast device based on m-INPOIC resulted in a preferred face-on orientation and increased molecular ordering with a higher PCE of 12.1% compared to 10.6% for p-INPOIC.
Jen and co-workers used a strong electron donating S,N-heteroacene core to prepare SN6IC and SN6IC-4F. OSCs based on PBDB-T:SN6IC-4F displayed an outstanding PCE of 13.2% and a VOC of 0.78 V, with an energy loss of 0.54 eV. The result demonstrated that the N-containing heteroacene is also an effective building block over the sp3-hybridized carbon in the fused ring electron acceptors. Cao et al. synthesized the DTCC-IC acceptor containing a dithienocyclopentacarbazole core end-capped with DCI units. The molecule has a high μe of 2.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. OSCs with the PTB7-Th donor and 1% CN additive resulted in a PCE of 6.0% and a VOC of 0.95 V.

Although various F-substituted acceptors have been discussed in the earlier sections, here we focus on use of acceptors containing halogen atoms such as F, Cl, and Br, which could be an effective approach for performance improvement. The C–X (X = halogen) bonds are highly polarized because of the higher electronegativity of halogens compared to carbon. Furthermore, the increase in C–X bond dipole moment increases the intramolecular charge-transfer among the D–A units. Substitution of F-, Cl-, and Br-atoms in the FDICTF series demonstrated a sequential red-shift in absorptions and lowering of the energy levels compared to non-halogenated FDICTF (Fig. 20). OSCs using the PBDB-T donor yielded PCEs of 10.85%, 11.47%, and 12.05% for FDICTF-F, FDICTF-Cl, and FDICTF-Br, respectively, which are higher than that of FDICTF (9.59%). All the data are presented in Table 6. Similarly, using the PTPDBDT polymer donor and ITIC-2F, ITIC-2Cl, and ITIC-2Br acceptors, higher PCEs of 8.8%, 9.5% and 9.4%, respectively, were achieved compared to ITIC (6.4%).

Recently, ITIC-2Br was employed in a conventional device using PDIN as a cathode interlayer, with its PCE reaching 12.63% and 12.19% for PBDB-TF and J71 as donors. The higher Jph/Jsat values under short circuit and maximal power output conditions explained the high FF for the J71 based device, while the VOC and JSC values were higher for the PBDB-TF based device.
A tetrachlorinated A–D–A type molecule (NCBDT-4Cl) was developed, which covers the region from 600 to 900 nm, peaking at 800 nm (Eg = 1.4 eV), and showed complementary absorption with PBDB-T-SF polymer. Optimization of the device with dual treatment, i.e. additive treatment and TA, reached a PCE of 14.1% with a higher JSC (22.35 mA cm−2) and FF (0.74). The obtained PCE was a remarkable value considering an Eloss of 0.55 eV, particularly important for high performance single-junction OSCs.
The Hou group developed two molecular acceptors ITIC-2Cl and ITIC-4Cl. The absorption band of an ITIC-4Cl film was broadened and red-shifted by ≈28 nm compared to IT-4F and ITIC-2Cl films. OSCs processed from non-halogenated solvent o-xylene using ITIC-2Cl and ITIC-4Cl as acceptors and PBDT-T-2F as a donor delivered high PCEs of 13.16 and 13.45%, respectively.
Laventure and Welch showed the influence of solvent additives on the performance of PBDB-T:ITIC-4Cl. When 0.5 wt% DIO or CN was used, the PCE reached 9.1 and 9.6%, respectively, compared to 9.0% without any treatment. The additives have some influence on the film morphology, showing a red-shift of the absorption maximum for the DIO-treated films, while a slight blue shift was observed when using the CN additive compared to the solvent only-processed film. The results suggested that the DIO additive promoted aggregation, while CN suppressed aggregation. The VOC values of the DIO- and CN-treated devices were 0.64 and 0.74 V compared to 0.69 V for the device without additive, while a slight decrease of the JSC from 22.9 to 21.5 mA cm−2 was observed when replacing DIO with CN as an additive. Recently, the Hou group reported a PCE of 9.8% with an exceptionally high VOC of 1.24 V for the PBDB-TF:ITIC-4Cl blend in a 1 cm2 cell. They further demonstrated an impressive PCE of 26.1% with a VOC of 1.1 V under indoor lighting conditions (1000 lux, 2700K LED light). Earlier, the same group developed a chlorinated acceptor (IEICO-4Cl) whose absorption band mainly resides in the near-IR region (700–1000 nm, λmax = 887 nm, Eg = 1.23 eV). OSCs prepared using three polymer donors PBDB-T, J52 and PTB7-Th gave PCEs between 9.7% and 10.3%. Interestingly, the color of the blend film could be changed from purple to blue to cyan depending on the polymer used, showing its suitability in semitransparent devices.
The chlorinated molecule BT-CIC absorbing at 820 nm with a low bandgap of 1.3 eV offered a PCE of 11.2% for the PTB7-Th:BT-CIC blend compared to 8.2% for BT-IC without the chlorine atom and 9.6% for PC71BM based devices. The BT-CIC device exhibited a low VOC of 0.7 V in comparison to ∼0.8 V for the BT-IC and PC71BM devices, while the JSC was increased significantly for BT-CIC, showing a trade-off between the VOC and JSC. The EQE reached about 75%, between 650 and 800 nm, extending to 950 nm, giving a transparency between 400 and 600 nm.
Another clear example of spectral broadening, lowering of the bandgap and enhancement of π–π stacking was observed upon sequential insertion of Cl-atoms into the FFAs IXIC, IXIC-2Cl, and IXIC-4Cl. A trade-off between the VOC and JSC was observed due to the lowering of the LUMO energy levels and spectral broadening after the chlorine substitution. Among the three acceptors, IXIC-2Cl in combination with the PBDB-T donor generated the highest PCE of 12.2% resulting from the balanced charge carrier mobilities μh/μe = 1.66. The JSC and FF values were significantly increased after TA treatment at 100 °C due to the enhancement of exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency.
The variation of the halogen unit in the terminal acceptor was also found to have a significant influence in carbazole-based acceptors DTTC-4F and DTTC-4Cl. A PBDB-TF:DTTC-4Cl based device displayed an excellent PCE of 15.42% (Eloss = 0.55 eV), which is higher than 13.89% (Eloss = 0.60 eV) obtained for a PBDB-TF:DTTC-4F based device. Although chlorination lowered the VOC due to its low LUMO energy level, the JSC increased due to the red-shifted absorption beneficial for light harvesting.

In this section the effects of the introduction of electron deficient benzothiadiazole, benzotriazole and quinoxaline cores into nitrogen-bridged heteroacenes are discussed (Fig. 21) and the data are presented in Table 7. These electron deficient cores were found to be very effective in modulating the energy level and molecular packing in the blend. Cui et al. recently developed a chlorinated acceptor (BTP-4Cl) which exhibited simultaneous increases in JSC and VOC compared to its fluorinated analogue BTP-4F (also named Y6) with a low Eloss of 0.53 eV. BTP-4Cl showed a 20 nm red-shifted absorption and a 0.1 eV lower LUMO energy level compared to BTP-4F. With improved photoresponse and photovoltage, an inverted device comprising PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl demonstrated an impressive PCE of 16.5% (Eloss = 0.53 eV) compared to ∼15.7% (Eloss = 0.57 eV) for a PBDB-TF:BTP-4F device using 0.5 vol% CN as an additive. The PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl device showed a higher EQEEL of 3.47 × 10−4 than the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F device (1.40 × 10−4) and the non-radiative energy loss (ΔE3) was decreased from 0.230 to 0.206 eV. The low ΔE3 generally ascribed to the high EQEEL of the acceptor. A large area single-junction device with 1 cm2 gave a PCE of 15.3%. Interestingly, a PCE of 14.1% was recorded for a thicker device with 250 nm. The JSC was increased compared to the thinner device but the FF decreased to a larger extent from 0.75 to 0.68. Even for active layer thicknesses up to 1000 nm, the PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl device resulted in an outstanding PCE of 12.1%, which was ascribed to its longer carrier lifetime and low trap-assisted recombination. However, a 1000 nm thick IT-4F device showed a PCE of only 4.72%. Moreover, a PCE of 10.1% could be realized for a 1000 nm thick device with an active layer thickness of 4 cm2. The result was further supported by the work of Tokmoldin et al., who demonstrated an extraordinary long electron diffusion length of 330 nm and hole diffusion length of 70 nm for the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F device which is an order of magnitude higher compared to devices based on other organics (10–20 nm). Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electroluminescence measurements, Hou and co-workers demonstrated that the increase in electrostatic potential (ESP) difference between the donor and acceptor enhances the intermolecular interaction, thus improving the charge transfer (CT) ratio. The increase in the CT ratio facilitated the charge separation and improved the JSC, while lower EQEEL reduced the VOC value, resulting in a highest PCE of 16% for the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F device compared to 8.2% for a BTP-0F-based device.

In another report it has been shown that the crystallization of acceptors plays a crucial role in performance tuning. A higher PCE of 16.88% was achieved for a PBDB-TF:BTP-4F based device processed from chloroform with 0.5 vol% CN as a solvent additive followed by TA treatment at 80 °C. The device without TA gave a PCE of 16.06%. When processed from chlorobenzene (CB), the device gave a PCE of 12.15%, showing a higher percentage of recombination in CB compared to the chloroform processed device. GIXD studies showed weak π–π stacking due to the random crystal orientation for BTP-4F in CB, while in chloroform strong π–π stacking with a face-on orientation was observed.
Ding and co-workers reported a fused-aromatic 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran-5-one-based D–A co-polymer (L1) which provides a wide bandgap of 1.96 eV, a deep HOMO energy level (−5.45 eV), good hole mobility and extended molecular planarity. The co-polymer L1 together with the BTP-4F acceptor offered PCEs of 14.36% and 14.63% in inverted and conventional OSCs respectively. The authors also prepared a thiolactone-based D–A copolymer (D16), which demonstrated an improved PCE of 16.22% in a conventional OSC using BTP-4F as an acceptor. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) for L1 and D16 devices were 96.7% and 97.8%, respectively, suggesting more efficient charge generation in the case of D16. When Al was replaced with Ag due to the high reflectance of Ag in the visible and near IR regions, the PCE of D16:BTP-4F was improved to 16.72%. Using the polymer D18 containing the dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) unit, the PCE was further enhanced to 18.2% (certified 17.6%) using chloroform for SVA, the highest value reported to date for OSCs. The cell generated broad EQE covering >80% from 460 to 740 nm, with a maximum of 87% at 540 nm, suggesting efficient photocurrent generation and a high exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) of 98.6% and low recombination.
To further improve the solubility of BTP-4F, longer 2-butyloctyl chains were introduced on pyrrole rings in BTP-4F-12. BTP-4F-12 exhibited better solubility and closed π–π stacking and when combined with the PBDB-TF donor gave a superior PCE of 16.4% compared to 15.7% for BTP-4F. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements revealed more suppressed carrier recombination and faster carrier transport for a BTP-4F-12 based OSC. Due to its higher solubility, BTP-4F-12 was also tested in non-chlorinated solvents, still maintaining high PCEs of 15.3% and 16.1% in o-xylene and THF, respectively. The results demonstrated the benefit of eco-friendly solvents to move OSCs from laboratory to large-scale industrial production.
Modification of alkyl chain length seems to be an excellent approach to fine tune the photovoltaic properties as can be seen in the case of BTP-eC9 and BTP-eC11. OSCs based on a spin-coated PBDB-TF:BTP-eC11 active layer gave a PCE of 16.9%, which increased to 17.8% when the alkyl chains on the terminal thiophene units were changed from C11 to C9 chains in BTP-eC9. The improvement was due to the improved JSC and FF resulting from the enhanced intermolecular ordering. All molecules showed nearly the same Eloss of approximately 0.55 eV. Blade-coated devices were also prepared with 1 cm2 size showing an excellent PCE of 16.2%.
The Zou and Yang group prepared two low bandgap acceptors Y1 and Y2 containing a benzotriazole central unit and different terminal DCI groups. A red-shifted absorption and a lower bandgap were observed for Y2 compared to Y1. Both Y1 and Y2 gave PCEs of around 13.4% and high JSCs above 22.0 mA cm−2 with the PBDB-T donor. The results suggested that the introduction of the central benzotriazole unit helps in reducing the recombination pathways, enhancing the electroluminescence yield of the blend and lowering the Eloss to 0.57 eV, while maintaining efficient charge generation and separation to obtain high photocurrent. The introduction of F-atoms in Y1-4F lowered the energy levels and bandgap, giving rise to a PCE of 14.8% with the PBDB-TF donor.
Molecular locking is an excellent strategy to reduce the energetic disorder in organic semiconductors. When alkyl chains were introduced on the terminal thiophenes of the central unit in Y11, the molecular conformation was restricted with low energetic disorder. Thus, a PBDB-TF:Y11 based OSC offered an improvement in PCE to 16.54% due to the low non-radiative recombination loss (ΔE3) of just 0.17 eV with a total Eloss of ∼0.43 eV. Using a similar molecule (Y14) containing one F-atom at each terminus generated a PCE of 14.92% and JSC of 26.15 mA cm−2 with PBDB-T as the donor, suggesting enhanced π–π stacking beneficial for charge transport.
Y5, which was prepared by replacing the central benzotriazole core of Y1 with the stronger electron withdrawing benzothiadiazole exhibited a blue-shifted absorption (738 nm vs. 802 nm for Y1) and a slightly higher optical bandgap of 1.38 eV (1.35 eV for Y1) and a deep lying HOMO energy level. A PBDB-T:Y5 based device gave an improved PCE of 14.1% with a high JSC above 20 mA cm−2.
The introduction of Me-groups in BTP-M resulted in a blue-shifted absorption and up-shifted energy levels. Due to the same HOMO energy level of PBDB-TF and BTP-M, the device gave a very low PCE of 4.26% due to the restriction of the photoinduced hole transfer from BTP-M to PBDB-TF. However, by using a non-fluorinated donor (PBDB-T) with a high lying HOMO level, the PCE was enhanced to 14.24%, showing an efficient hole transport.
Zhu et al. introduced the quinoxaline unit as the central core in acceptors Aqx1 and Aqx2. The subtle difference between the molecular structures is the methyl groups on the quinoxaline unit, which has a minimal influence on the thin film absorption and optical bandgap. However, OSCs based on PBDB-TF:Aqx2 gave a PCE of 16.64%, which is considerably higher than that of Aqx1 (13.31%). This difference was mainly due to their different blend morphologies where Aqx2 adopted stronger π–π interaction than Aqx1 and improved hole transfer and suppressed the geminate recombination. These devices exhibit very similar Eloss values of 0.52 and 0.54 eV, respectively, where Eoptg was determined from the intersection of the absorption and emission of the blend film.

Replacement of the central phenyl ring of IDIC with the naphthalene group to form DTNIC blue-shifted the absorption band (660 nm relative to 716 nm for IDIC) and raise the LUMO energy level (−3.93 eV) (Fig. 22). The data are presented in Table 8. OSCs were prepared using two different ETL layers, such as ZnO and bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD) modified TiO2. The ZnO-based device gave a PCE of 8.72% using PBDB-T as the donor which was further increased to 9.03% using TOPD@TiO2. The higher performance was ascribed to the balanced charge transport with face-on π–π stacking. When a weaker electron-accepting group was introduced in DTNR, the LUMO energy level was upshifted and offered a ΔELUMO of 0.13 eV with PTB7-Th. Still the charge separation process maintained providing a PCE of 9.51% with a high VOC of 1.08 V using CN as an additive. Film morphology studies revealed nanofibrillar structures which favor exciton separation and charge transport.

The Chen group prepared two acceptors O-NTIC and O-NTNC comprising different acceptor units. The naphthyl-terminated acceptor in O-NTNC enhanced the π–π stacking and red-shifted the absorption. OSCs based on these acceptors gave PCEs of 9.1% and 11.0% using PBDB-T as the donor. Despite the lower VOC the higher PCE for the O-NTNC-based device was mainly due to its high JSC and FF. Further the authors synthesized a series of acceptors (NTIC) with a hexacyclic naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene) core by replacing the central benzene ring of IDT-IC with the naphthalene unit. Further, the influence of electron donating and withdrawing groups (–Me, –OMe and –F) attached to the NTIC on solar cell performance was studied using PBDB-T as the donor. All the devices generated PCEs above 8% and NTIC without substituent gave the best PCE (8.63%). A tradeoff between VOC and JSC was observed as the electron donating groups enhanced the VOC, while the electron accepting F-unit gave a higher JSC and the lowest VOC value.
Zhan and co-workers prepared two FFAs, IHIC2 and IOIC2. Due to its extended conjugation and alkyl substitution at the 3,8-position of the naphthyl core, IOIC2 showed an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer absorption, elevated energy levels and high electron mobility. The FTAZ:IOIC2-based inverted OSC gave a PCE of 12.3%, significantly higher than that of the device based on IHIC2 (PCE = 7.3%) due to improvement in all parameters. Recently, the authors prepared IOIC3 by introducing the hexyloxy group at the naphthyl core. Because of the σ-inductive effect of the oxygen atoms, the HOMO energy level of IOIC3 was destabilized and the LUMO level was stabilized, leading to lowering of the bandgap and red shift of the absorption band by 35 nm compared to IOIC2. The PTB7-Th:IOIC3 blend achieved a PCE of 13.1%, which is about 40% higher than that of the PTB7-Th:IOIC2 device (9.33%).
Two molecular acceptors NCIC and NCFIC were prepared by introducing alkyl chains at the central angular 4,9-position of the naphthalene core. It has been proposed that, in comparison to IOIC2, the alkyl substitution at the 4,9-position could reduce the steric hindrance and maintain the backbone coplanarity. Fluorination in NCFIC red shifted the absorption by 55 nm with lowering of the Eoptg. OSCs with the PBDB-T donor gave PCEs of 7.3 and 7.5%, respectively, due to their much low carrier mobilities. Marder and co-workers synthesized an octyl-substituted IHIC-N acceptor which has a different core-substitution pattern than DTNIC and NTIC and compared it with IHIC with a thienothiophene core. Pairing PTB7-Th with IHIC-N and IHIC yielded PCEs of 6.91% and 10.6%, respectively. Although the IHIC-based device showed a 0.1 V lower VOC than IHIC-N, the JSC and FF were quite high for IHIC.

The Ding group followed a new strategy synthesized a series of stronger electron donating polycyclic molecules by replacing the “C-bridge” in an IDT core with a “C–O bridge”. The optical and photovoltaic data are presented in Table 9. The introduction of the C–O bridge enhances the solubility, absorption and molecular packing in thin films (Fig. 23). The first in the series was CO5IC, which showed a smaller Eoptg (1.62 eV) than C-bridged IDT-IC (1.70 eV). OSCs using the PBDB-T donor gave a PCE of 7.49% compared to 6.09% for IDT-IC due to higher electron mobility, increased light harvesting capacity and ordered film formation. The authors further replaced the central benzene moiety in CO5IC with an electron-rich thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and synthesized three hexacyclic C–O-bridged FFAs CO6IC, CO6FIC and CO6DFIC. The Eoptg concomitantly decreased from 1.37 to 1.34 to 1.31 eV, respectively, with strong absorption in the NIR region. Using the FTAZ polymer, the device with CO6FIC exhibited the highest PCE of 9.12%. Interestingly, a trade-off between the VOC and JSC was also observed.

The octacyclic derivative of Coi8DFIC with a longer thiophene bridge further lowered the Eoptg to 1.26 eV in thin film. An OSC generated a PCE of 12.16% with an extremely high JSC of 26.1 mA cm−2 using PTB7-Th as the donor. Its EQE extended up to 1000 nm with a maximum of 83% at 830 nm. The PCE of the PTB7-Th:Coi8DFIC blend can be further enhanced to 13.8% by changing the flat-on and edge-on lamellar structures to face-on H- and J-type stacking by TA treatment instead of SVA.
Introduction of a thiophene spacer into the CO5-bridge in Ph-DTDP-TIC red-shifted the absorption and lowered the Eoptg to 1.46 eV. A PBDB-T:Ph-DTDP-TIC based OSC yielded a PCE of 9.21%. Zhu and co-workers prepared the NBDTP acceptor in which the bridging C–O bonds are pointing to the benzene ring and achieved a PCE of 10.1% for the thermally annealed device using the PBDB-T donor. Using the PTIC acceptor, an isomeric structure to CO5IC, the OSC gave a PCE of 7.66% with PBDB-T as the donor.

In this section the insertion of selenophene units in the molecular backbone and their influence on material properties and device performance are discussed (Fig. 24) and the data are presented in Table 9. Selenium insertion enhances the molecular aggregation due to its larger size. Moreover, due to the lower aromatic character and greater polarizability of selenophene units and increased quinoidal content in the molecule, the molecular planarity is enhanced, and thus the absorption is red shifted and the bandgap is reduced, compared to its thiophene analogue. In 2016, the molecular acceptor IDTIDSe-IC was reported by replacing the terminal thiophenes of IDTIDT-IC with selenophenes. Using the complementary absorbing polymer J51, which showed a ΔELUMO of 0.51 eV and a ΔEHOMO of 0.12 eV while maintaining efficient charge transfer, the solar cell gave a PCE of 8.0%. A similar device with J51:IDSe-T-IC (selenophene analog of the IDT core) exhibited a PCE of 8.58% without any external treatment.

The molecular planarity was improved by replacing the thiophene spacer of the IEIC acceptor with selenophene to form IDT2Se, thus reducing the Eoptg to 1.45 eV and to 1.39 eV by introducing F atoms in IDT2Se-F. OSCs using IDT2Se and IDT2Se-F as acceptors and PBDB-T as a donor achieved PCEs of 9.36% and 11.2%. The fluorinated derivative gave a lower VOC but higher JSC and FF values.
Peng and co-workers reported two benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]diselenophene-based FFAs (BDSeThCl and BDSePhCl). BDSePhCl displayed a significant red-shifted absorption compared to BDSeThCl (Δλmax = 84 nm) and a lower bandgap. An OSC with PBDB-TCl:BDSePhCl gave the best PCE of 13.68% with an Eloss of 0.49 eV rather than 11.91% for a PBDB-TCl:BDSeThCl device with Eloss = 0.58 due to suitable phase separation and balanced charge mobilities.
The use of an indacenodiselenopheno[3,2-b]thiophene core in Se-TIC was found to enhance the planarity and red-shifted the absorption compared to the thiophene analogue ITIC. The chlorinated derivative Se-TIC4Cl further red-shifted the absorption to the near-IR region and had down-shifted HOMO/LUMO energy levels compared to Se-TIC. An OSC based on PBDB-TF:Se-TIC4Cl exhibited high crystallinity and favorable phase separation with a PCE of 13.3% compared to 7.46% for a Se-TIC based device. Although the JSC and FF for Se-TIC4Cl increased compared to the Se-TIC device, the VOC was dramatically reduced due to its lower LUMO level. Liu et al. reported the low bandgap acceptor TSeTIC containing an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene core which when blended with the PBDB-TF polymer delivered an enhanced PCE of 13.71% and a high FF of 0.76 which are higher than those of the PBDB-TF:ITTC device (PCE of 12.05%, FF of 0.70).

Mishra et al. reported two FFAs namely PY-1 and DCI-2 containing a central dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole donor unit and end-capping acceptors 1-butyl-4-methyl-2,6-dioxopyridine-3-carbonitrile (PY) and 3-dicyanomethyleneindan-1-one (DCI) respectively (Fig. 25). In thin films the oligomers showed strong absorption at 750 nm (Eoptg = 1.40 eV) and 888 nm (Eoptg = 1.23 eV), respectively. The red-shift of the DCI-2 acceptor was assigned to the strong intermolecular H-bonding interactions between vinylic or aromatic CH and the N-atom of a neighbouring cyano group (C-H⋯NC). Using a complementary absorbing polymer donor (P1), PY-1 and DCI-2 based OSCs generated PCEs of 4.89% and 6.94%, respectively, using DIO as a solvent additive. Interestingly, a high VOC of ∼0.80 V with an exceptionally low Eloss of 0.39 eV, one of the lowest values achieved to date, and a high EQE of 69%@880 nm was achieved for DCI-2-based devices. The optical and photovoltaic data are given in Table 9.

Chen and co-workers prepared an electron acceptor (DICTF) bearing a thiophene spacer linked between the core and terminal DCI acceptors. The oligomer demonstrated an absorption maximum at 587 nm with an Eoptg of 1.82 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.67 and −3.79 eV and matched well with those of the PTB7-Th donor. Conventional fullerene-free OSCs prepared with DICTF as an acceptor and PTB7-Th as a donor delivered a PCE of 7.93% comparable to a device based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM (8.28%).
Zhu and co-workers replaced the thiophene spacer of DICTF with thieno[3,4-b]thiophene moieties to prepare a new electron acceptor, NFTI. The molecule displayed a λmax of 706 nm in thin film with the Eoptg reduced to 1.57 eV due to the introduction of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene groups. The HOMO and LUMO energetics were destabilized compared to DICTF and were −5.46 and −3.77 eV. A 9.0% PCE was demonstrated by employing diphenyl ether (DPE) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) as binary-processing additives. The morphology study using AFM and 2D GIWAXS further proved the influence of the additives on the enhancement of charge separation and transport in BHJ layers by reducing nanocrystal size and increasing intermolecular interactions.

Small molecules or oligomers have several advantages over polymers, like their monodisperse nature, synthetic purity, and reproducible device performance due to the lack of batch-to-batch variations. Compared to polymers, very few oligomers have been tested in fullerene-free OSCs maybe due to their strong aggregation tendency and poor phase separations. The optical and photovoltaic data are depicted in Table 10.

The first all small molecule OSC comprising a BDT-based oligomer (BDT3TR) containing rhodanine end groups which displayed complementary absorption to the O-IDTBR acceptor yielded a PCE of 7.1% with a VOC of 1.06 V (Fig. 26). Two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-functionalized donor molecules BDT-2DPP and BDTS-2DPP were developed. The BDTS-2DPP:IEIC combination was found to be compatible with both conventional and inverted device structures, giving rise to PCEs of 5.3 and 6.0%, respectively. At the same time, the BDT-2DPP-based device yielded a lower PCE of 4.0%. Using BDT-BTz1 and BDT-BTz2 as donors and IDIC as an acceptor, Li and co-workers achieved PCEs of 9.73 and 5.51%, respectively. The higher performance of BDT-BTz1 was ascribed to the bimodal charge transport originating from both edge-on and face-on crystallite packing, while BDT-BTz2 adopted a predominant edge-on orientation. Later, the PCE was improved to 10.1% with a high FF of 0.73 using the BDT-3T1:IDIC blend, almost double that of the device using BDT-3T2 as a donor (5.32%). Li et al. achieved a moderate PCE of 6.6% for a naphthalene-fused oligomer NDTR donor and IDIC acceptor blend due to poor charge transport. The rhodanine-based molecule DRBDT-TVT with the IDIC acceptor yielded a PCE of 6.63%.
Hou and co-workers achieved a high PCE of 9.08% using the DRTB-T-C2:IDIC blend in a conventional device after SVA treatment. With the IT-4F acceptor, the DRTB-T-C4 device gave a higher PCE of 11.24% compared to 9.52% for the DRTB-T-C2 device. The difference was ascribed to the change from the edge-on orientation for DRTB-T-C2 to the face-on orientation for DRTB-T-C4, showing the influence of molecular packing on charge transport properties. Thicker devices up to 300 nm could also be prepared from DRTB-T-C4:IT-4F, while maintaining PCEs of 10%. A moderate PCE of 6.36% with a high VOC of 1.15 V and Eloss of 0.54 eV was reached for the DR3TBDT-T donor and O-IDTBR acceptor blend, which resulted from the low non-radiative recombination loss of 0.21 eV.
Chen and co-workers prepared three molecular acceptors with variable substituents and in OSCs together with the DRCN5T donor reached PCEs of 8.0% for IDIC8-H, 6.31% for IDIC8-M and 8.42% for IDIC8-F after SVA treatment using CS2:CHCl3 solvent. The slightly improved PCE for IDIC8-F was ascribed to the higher JSC and FF coming from the face-on orientation of the D:A mixture. Despite its low PCE, a high VOC was achieved for IDIC8-M due to its higher LUMO energy level.
In a recent report, the Xiao, Sun and Lu group developed a liquid crystalline oligomer (BTR-Cl) which in combination with complementary absorbing BTP-4F as an acceptor achieved a high PCE of 13.6%. In comparison to BTR (phase transition temp. 122 °C), BTR-Cl exhibited strong crystallinity and high phase transition temperature (195 °C), enabling strong intermolecular interaction. The insertion of chlorine atoms down-shifted the HOMO energy level of the donor, leading to slightly higher VOC. GIWAXS studies revealed an edge-on orientation of BTR-Cl in the blend, while BTP-4F adopted a face-on π–π orientation, suggesting both parallel and vertical charge transport pathways. An AFM investigation revealed a surface roughness of 2.03 nm for the BTR-Cl:BTP-4F blend and 1.43 nm for the BTR:BTP-4F blend, showing significant phase separation in the former. The PCE of the BTR-Cl:BTP-4F based device was further enhanced to 14.7% by manipulating the active layer morphology induced by varying the solution concentration, keeping the thickness ∼110 nm.
Zhu and co-workers used sequential SVA + TA treatments to optimize OSCs based on a complementary absorbing BSFTR:BTP-4F blend, which showed better crystallinity and favorable phase separation, beneficial for exciton dissociation, and charge transport and extraction. The as-cast device showed a very poor PCE of 0.22%, which was improved to 4.56% after SVA treatment due to the significant enhancement in JSC from 0.97 to 14.21 mA cm−2. Upon TA treatment, both JSC (22.86 mA cm−2) and FF (0.24 to 0.65) improved, leading to a PCE of 12.56%, which further improved to 13.69% upon sequential SVA + TA treatments.
A π-extended benzodithienothiophene-based small molecule donor DTBDT1 and BTP-4F blend showed an enhanced crystallization and high phase purity, with an appropriate crystal orientation enabling an excellent PCE of 14.34% with a high JSC of 24.34 mA cm−2 and a low Eloss of 0.52 eV. The results demonstrated that the hierarchical morphology is also important for charge separation and transport. The results demonstrated that the material combination, optimization and control of the nanoscale morphology are very important to achieve high performance devices and there is always room for further improvement.
Hou and co-workers used SVA treatment to optimize BTR:BTP-eC11 and BSPR:BTP-eC11 based OSCs. The phenyl-substituted molecule, BSPR, showed strong interactions with the acceptor compared to the thiophene analogue, BTR, resulting in an outstanding PCE of 15.3% with simultaneous increases in JSC and FF compared to 11.4% for the BTR-based device. GIWAX diffraction analysis revealed that, in the active layer, BSPR induced an edge-on to face-on orientation, while a similar molecular orientation (face-on) was observed for BTR in its pristine form as well as in a blend with the acceptor. Li and co-workers used TA treatment to optimize the nanoscale blend morphology for the SM1-S and SM1-F donors, and the BTP-4F acceptor. The optimized device based on SM1-F:BTP-4F exhibited an enhanced PCE of 14.07% compared to 12.94% for the SM1-S:BTP-4F device. The SM1-F:BTP-4F blend also showed a high PCE of 11.9% with a high JSC and FF when the active layer thickness was increased from 60 nm to 250 nm. However, for the SM1-S:BTP-4F-based device, the performance decreased after the thickness exceeded 150 nm. The TA treatment was found to be very effective in fine-tuning the phase separation and improving the blend crystallinity and aggregation feature.

For a binary system with a blend of one donor and one acceptor it is not possible to cover the whole spectral range, even with complementary absorbing materials. Therefore, ternary OSCs using two donor–one acceptor or one donor–two acceptor systems are found to be very effective in covering a wide spectral range to utilize more photons, beneficial to obtain high JSC (Fig. 27). Although the device fabrication is simplified in ternary systems compared to tandem structures, further optimization of the third component, which often acts as a recombination centre, is necessary to improve the device performance. The third component in ternary devices could fill the absorption gap and at the same time provide a cascade energy level alignment for efficient charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interface to tune the photovoltage and to achieve high PCE.

In ternary devices four interrelated working mechanisms have been proposed: (a) charge transfer, (b) energy transfer, (c) parallel-linkage and (d) alloy model (Fig. 28). (a) In the charge transfer mechanism, the energy level alignment of the third component is very important. The third component acts as a cascade charge transfer pathway upon photoexcitation and then the free charge carriers are transported to the respective electrodes via one donor and acceptor. (b) In the energy transfer process, after light absorption energy transfer takes place from one molecule to another via long-distance Förster (FRET) or short-distance Dexter energy transfer mechanisms. Therefore, more charge carriers are generated at the second donor and then transferred to the acceptor and respective electrodes. (c) In the parallel linkage model upon photoexcitation the excitons are generated independently at both the donors which then dissociate into free charge carriers at the respective interfaces with the acceptor. (d) In the alloy model the two donors or two acceptors electronically coupled to form a new charge transfer state depending on the composition of both components. Therefore, the VOC generally varies in the alloy model depending on the composition of the D and A. The photovoltaic data of the ternary devices discussed in this section are presented in Table 11.

A ternary OSC prepared using two polymers PTB7-Th and J51 as donors and ITIC as an acceptor generated a PCE of 9.7%, which was much higher than those of the binary devices (J51:ITIC = 8.89% and PTB7-Th:ITIC = 6.56%, respectively). This high performance was mainly due to the strong energy transfer that occurred from J51 to PTB7-Th because of the large overlap between the emission spectrum of J51 and the absorption spectrum of PTB7-Th and the complete emission quenching of PTB7-Th by the ITIC acceptor, suggesting enhanced exciton dissociation and charge collection in the device.

Ternary devices based on the low bandgap acceptor BT-IC and two complementary absorbing polymers J51 and PTB7-Th exhibited a PCE of 10.32% without any additive compared to 9.43% and 7.78% for J51:BT-IC and PTB7-Th:BT-IC binary devices. The ternary device with around 30% PTB7-Th efficiently suppressed the bimolecular recombination with α = 0.977 relative to 0.97 and 0.975 for both binary devices, which correlated with increased JSC. By introduction of 30% J52 as a secondary donor into the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend, a PCE of 10.9% and a high JSC 25.3 mA cm−2 could be achieved, which resulted from the improvement of photoresponse in the lower wavelength region.
A ternary device based on PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F reached a maximum PCE of 11.62% by using 20 wt% PTB7-Th and PDIN as an ETL. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the PBDB-T to PTB7-Th polymer and complementary absorption with very similar HOMO energy levels were the causes of high performance. The EQE spectrum showed a broad coverage from the 300 to 960 nm region, thus generating a high JSC of 24.14 mA cm−2.
By using 5 wt% PDTfBO-TT polymer with a strong aggregation tendency as the third component in PBDB-T:IT-M and PBDB-T:ITIC binary blends, high PCEs of 13.52 and 12.70% have been realized. The small amount of PDTfBO-TT significantly improved the molecular ordering in the active layer while maintaining the nanoscale morphology, and thus improved charge transport and reduced charge recombination compared to the binary devices. Both devices showed excellent FFs of ∼0.78, which demonstrated that the addition of the third component with a strong crystallization ability while maintaining the appropriate blend morphology is very crucial for obtaining high performance devices.
It has been reported that Förster resonance energy transfer plays an important role in a ternary blend to improve the current density without disturbing the absorption behaviors of the binary blends in the near-IR region. In this system upon photoexcitation one of the donors transferred its energy to the other donor molecule due to the overlap of the emission of the former with the absorption of the latter molecule. In the PCDTBT:PTB7-Th blend efficient energy transfer took place from PCDTBT to PTB7-Th. Although the absorption of ITIC also overlapped with PCDTBT emission, both emissions were quenched, suggesting that the energy transfer was not efficient between these molecules, rather sufficient exciton dissociation occurred in a blend film of PCDTBT:ITIC. The inverted ternary device comprising PCDTBT:PTB7-Th:ITIC generated a PCE of 9.53% with only 20 wt% PCDTBT, which mostly covered the 300–600 nm region. The efficiency was greater than that of the PTB7-Th:ITIC binary system (PCE = 7.9%). When ITIC was replaced with the low bandgap acceptor IEICO-4F, the PCE further improved to 12.2%. Moreover, the device stability of the ternary system was improved compared to the binary devices due to the interconnected morphology in ternary films.
The addition of 25% of the medium bandgap small molecule donor DR3TBDTT-S as the third component to the PTB7-Th:FOIC binary blend resulted in a ternary device with a PCE of 13.1%, higher than that of the binary counterpart (12.1%). A transient absorption spectroscopy study revealed long range resonance energy transfer from the donor to acceptor phase.
Ternary devices prepared by the addition of 20 wt% J71 to the PBDB-TF:ITIC-2Br binary blend achieved a PCE of 14.1%, benefitting from the synergistic improvement of JSC and FF. The PBDB-TF and J71 formed an alloy donor mixture, which was confirmed by the variable VOCs with different donor contents and relatively higher FF values in the ternary OSCs. Also the Jph/Jsat values for the ternary devices were relatively higher than those of the binary devices, indicating more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection.
In ternary OSCs with PBDB-TF as the donor and IT-4F as the acceptor, adding 20 wt% of a coumarin derivative (C1) as a secondary donor led to a PCE of 11.56%. The PCE of ternary devices was higher compared to the C1:IT-4F (8.3%) and PBDB-TF:IT-4F (10.7%) binary devices. The improvement was mainly associated with the efficient exciton generation and the dissociation via Förster resonance energy transfer, providing sufficient time for the diffusion of an exciton at the D/A interfaces and the formation of an alloy model between the two donors.

Fullerene derivatives were successfully employed as third components in many ternary systems. In 2016, the Bo group revealed a PCE of 10.4% for the PPBDTBT:ITIC:PC71BM ternary system, which is a ∼35% enhancement compared to the binary counterparts. The PC71BM helped in tuning the morphology for charge transport and the ITIC acceptor formed a cascade energy level alignment and extended the absorption, thus improving the photocurrent. A similar cascade energy gradient was also observed upon introducing bis-PC71BM or IC70BA into the PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO blend. The fullerene derivatives helped in modifying the morphology and facilitating electron transfer from the PBDTTT-E-T donor to IEICO acceptor via a cascade energy level alignment, thus increasing the JSC and FF. Ternary OSCs using 5% (w/w) bis-PC71BM or IC70BA achieved PCEs of ∼10.2%, relative to 8.33% obtained for the PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO binary device. The addition of bis-PC71BM to the PBDB-T:IT-M binary system improved the PCE to 12.2%. A ternary device based on PBTA-BO:PC71BM:IFFBR exhibited a PCE of 9.06%, which was considerably higher than those of the respective binary devices (6.34% for PBTA-BO:IFFBR) and 4.73% for PBTA-BO:PC71BM). An analogous ternary device based on PBTA-BO:PC71BM:IFBR delivered a PCE of 8.1%.

Addition of 10 wt% of the fullerene derivative NCBA to a blend of PBDB-T and ITIC enhanced the PCE to 9.56% compared to 8.45% for a PBDB-T:ITIC binary device. Similar cascade charge transport occurs from PBDB-T to ITIC via the NCBA acceptor. When 20 wt% PC71BM was introduced into PBDB-T:IDIC8-M, the ternary device gave a PCE of 10.67% relative to 9.65% for the binary device. Similarly, a PBDB-T:NFBDT:PC71BM ternary system yielded a PCE of 9.73%. Xiao et al. reported an outstanding PCE of 14.1% with a record JSC of 28.2 mA cm−2 for a PTB7-Th:Coi8DFIC:PC71BM ternary blend. Wang and co-workers further increased the PCE of PTB7-Th:Coi8DFIC:PC71BM ternary cells to 14.62% using post TA treatment. When the fullerene content was increased, an increase in the VOC was observed, but the JSC and FF decreased.
Using an IDT2BR:PC71BM acceptor alloy, two polymer donors PffBT4T-2OD and PTB7-Th were investigated and were found to generate PCEs >9.0% in ternary devices. The alloy of acceptors (well mixed phase) allows tuning of the energy levels of the acceptor phase by varying the blend ratio. The photoluminescence and EQE studies revealed the cascade of charge transport pathways from the polymer donor to IDT2BR to PC71BM.
The addition of PC71BM as the third component to PBDB-T:NCIC and PBDB-T:NCFIC blends formed ternary systems which improved light absorption in the high energy region of around 350–500 nm and provided channels for exciton dissociation and electron transport, and thus improved the JSC. The optimized ternary devices based on PBDB-T:NCIC:PC71BM (1:1:1 in wt%) and PBDB-T:NCFIC:PC71BM (1:1:1.5 in wt%) in an inverted configuration offered PCEs of 8.32 and 9.18%, respectively. However, a gradual reduction in the VOC was observed upon the addition of PC71BM, suggesting the formation of an alloy system between the two acceptors in the ternary blend. Incorporation of a small portion of PC71BM (15 wt%) into the PBDB-T:m-INPOIC blend resulted in balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.06) and thus the as cast ternary device achieved an improved PCE of 14.0% and high device stability.
Zhu and co-workers fabricated an all-small molecule ternary OSC by using a small molecule donor (BTR) and NITI (Fig. 29) and PC71BM as acceptors. Both the BTR and NITI showed complementary absorption covering the visible to NIR regions and formed a cascade charge transport pathway with PC71BM. The results demonstrated the formation of an ideal morphology of the ternary blend, which subsequently increased the charge generation, reduced the Eloss and increased the device performance. The ternary device using BTR:NITI:PC71BM (1:0.4:1) generated an excellent PCE of 13.63% (Eloss = 0.55 eV) after SVA treatment with THF, benefiting from the hierarchical morphology of both the fullerene and FFA, where NITI can enrich in the BTR:PC71BM boundary. In comparison, the BTR:PC71BM and BTR:NITI binary devices achieved PCEs of 9.03% and 6.82% respectively. The VOC improvement was related to NITI, while the PC71BM and the crystallinity of BTR balance the carrier transport and reduce bimolecular recombination, thus improving the JSC and FF. The morphology was further supported by GIWAXS analysis. All small molecule OSCs based on BTR-Cl:BTP-4F gave an outstanding PCE of 15.34% when 5 wt% PC71BM was added to the active layer to modulate the active layer morphology. The introduction of PC71BM significantly improved the FF from 0.69 to 0.77 without sacrificing the VOC and JSC.
The morphology of the binary BHJ layer containing a polymer donor and FFA can be fine-tuned by addition of fullerene derivatives as second acceptors. A binary device containing PBDTTPD-HT:ITIC generated a PCE of 9.95% with a high VOC of 0.97 and FF of 0.69. When PC71BM was introduced, the PCE and the FF increased to 12.09% and 0.74, whereas the VOC was marginally reduced to 0.95 V, suggesting minimal energy losses in the device. The corresponding PBDTTPD-HT:PC71BM binary device gave a lower PCE of 7.78% with a higher FF of 0.75. The results suggested that the improved FF in the ternary device after the addition of PC71BM was mainly due to the ordered morphology in the ternary blend induced by PC71BM. 2D GIXRD analysis revealed that a neat film of the ITIC acceptor showed strong π–π stacking with lamellar ordering (Fig. 30). However, in both the binary blends the lamellar ordering was absent with weak π–π stacking. The lamellar ordering reappeared when PC71BM was added to the PBDTTPD-HT:ITIC mixture. The phenomenon was projected by a parallel-like model where the charges were generated independently at both the D:A interfaces and collected through the respective domains.
Li et al. demonstrated a simple method of rinsing a PEDOT:PSS anode interfacial layer with water and removed the excess PSS present in the solution and increased the conductivity, leading to an excellent PCE of 16.75% for the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F:PC71BM ternary blend. When using 20% PC71BM as the ternary component, a PCE of 16.7% was independently reported. The authors further demonstrated that a high efficiency ITO-free flexible OSC with 14.1% can be fabricated on a PET substrate. Hou and co-workers introduced a small amount of PC61BM (20%) into the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F blend to enhance the PCE to 16.5% (certified 16.2%) compared to 15.3% for the binary device. The introduction of PC61BM increased the μe, improved charge transport and reduced nonradiative energy loss.

A ternary device using the prototype donor P3HT and O-IDTBR:O-IDFBR acceptors achieved a PCE of 7.7%. O-IDFBR formed an energy cascade with P3HT and O-IDTBR and improved the VOC. A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study revealed the strong crystallization tendency of O-IDTBR even when blended with P3HT, which was reduced by addition of O-IDFBR as the third component. The transformation of the O-IDTBR crystalline phase into a glassy alloy by O-IDFBR led to the preservation of the microstructure crystallinity, thus enhancing the shelf-life and photostability of the ternary device. The PCE was further improved to 11% with a VOC of 1.03 V by replacing P3HT with complementary absorbing PTB7-Th as the donor. Zhan and co-workers attained a PCE of 10.1% by adding 1 wt% PDI-2DTT to the PTB7-Th:IDT-2BR blend to enhance the charge transfer process.

The exciton migration can be improved over a long range by a nonradiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism leading to enhancement of the PCE. FRET occurs between molecules when the emission of a donor overlaps with the absorption of an acceptor. In the PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th:FBR-CN ternary system, FBR-CN acts as an additional absorber in the higher energy region and at the same time transfers energy to ITIC-Th via a FRET mechanism. Using 1 wt% FBR-CN the PCE of the ternary device was increased from 8.1% to 9.82%, mainly due to the increase in the JSC value. Replacement of PTB7-Th with the PBDB-T donor with 5 wt% FBR-CN further enhanced the PCE to 10.4%. The results showed that FRET can be an important method for performance enhancement in OSCs.
Hou and co-workers achieved a PCE of 11.1% for a ternary device consisting of the J52 donor and IEICO and IT-M as acceptors with similar LUMO energy levels. When IT-M (10 wt%) was incorporated into a PBDB-T:m-INPOIC binary mixture the phase separation improved by forming a continuous and balanced charge transport pathway, leading to an increase in PCE to 13.9% from 12.8% for the binary device. Sun and co-workers used PDBT-T1 as the donor along with complementary absorbing SdiPDI-Se and ITIC-Th to achieve a PCE of 10.3%. The addition of ITIC-Th reduced the acceptor crystallinity, while maintaining efficient charge transport. Marder and co-workers obtained a PCE of 11.9% with the PTB7-Th:IHIC-N:IHIC blend, which is higher than those of the corresponding binary devices (6.9% and 10.6%). A GIWAXS study revealed an improved face-on orientation in the ternary blend, consistent with the balanced carrier mobility favorable for charge transport. Wang and co-workers achieved a PCE of 11.6% by adding 10 wt% ITIC to the J71:IT-M blend in which ITIC helped in improving the FF, while IT-M contributed to high JSC and VOC.
A PCE of 11% was achieved when a small amount of TPE-4PDI was added to the PBDB-T:ITIC-Th blend. TPE-4PDI formed an acceptor alloy with ITIC-Th and tuned the VOC value which relied on the weight ratio of the alloy mixture. A ternary OSC using the PBDB-T donor and NNBDT:FDNCTF dual acceptors exhibited a high PCE of 12.8%. The overlap of FDNCTF emission and NNBDT absorption suggests the existence of efficient energy transfer as studied by photoluminescence quenching.
Ternary devices prepared using PTB7-Th:ITIC-2F:IOTIC-2F achieved a PCE of 12.9% in which ITIC-2F helped in improving the charge transport via a cascade energy gradient. In an another report when 5% of the acceptor F11IC was added into the FTAZ:F(5–9)IC binary blends, the resulting ternary devices showed an increase in the PCE from 6.3% to 12.6% with the increase in the core size from 5 to 9 units. Li and co-workers demonstrated efficient charge transport from the PSTZ polymer to the IDIC acceptor through ITIC, which facilitated the formation of a cascade energy gradient. The device achieved a PCE of 10.2% by introducing 10 wt% ITIC into the PSTz:IDIC (8.06%) binary blend, which was improved to 11.1% by TA treatment. The two alloy acceptors ITIC and IDIC formed an energy gradient for charge transport. Yan and co-workers reported a PCE of 11.2% for the PTFB-O:ITIC-Th:IEIC-Th blend. When processed from hot solution, the polymer formed nanofibrillar small domains while cooling during spin-coating due to its strong TDA properties. Then the acceptors formed mixed lamellar packing with a preferential face-on orientation (Fig. 31).
The FFA ITCN based on an indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene core and 3-octyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine terminal moieties was developed and used as the third component in the PBDB-T:IT-M binary blend. 20% ITCN was sufficient to improve the cascade charge transport process in the device. The ternary blend PBDB-T:ITCN:IT-M offered a PCE of 12.16%, which is significantly improved compared to both the binary systems (PBDB-T:ITCN = 2.21% and PBDB-T:IT-M = 10.89%). The enhancement of VOC was due to the higher LUMO energy level of ITCN compared to IT-M.
Xiao et al. reported an electron acceptor (IDT-T) which functioned as an energy transfer donor and an energy level mediator and modulated the crystallization process in ternary blends of PBDB-T:ITIC, thus contributing synergistically to higher VOC, JSC, and FF. The energy transfer occurs from IDT-T to ITIC. The ternary device offered a PCE of 12.2%, while the corresponding binary devices gave a lowered PCE of 7.4% for PBDB-T:IDT-T and 10.5% for PBDB-T:ITIC. (Fig. 31). The IDT-T-based binary device gave a higher VOC, while a higher JSC was observed for the ITIC-based device.
Ternary OSCs based on the donor polymer PBDB-TF and two structurally alike FFAs ITTC and ITTC-M (1:0.4:0.6 wt%) gave an excellent PCE of 14.13% using a conventional device structure. The work function of Al was lowered by the insertion of a Zracac cathode interlayer. The PBDB-TF:ITTC and PBDB-TF:ITTC-M binary devices achieved PCEs of 12.31 and 13.04%, respectively. All the devices demonstrated excellent FFs above 0.70, with the best value of 0.78 for the ternary OSC. The addition of 0.4 wt% of the ITTC acceptor into the PBDB-TF:ITTC-M binary blend reduced the crystallinity of ITTC-M and thus the domain size and improved the blend morphology. When ITIC-2Cl (20% by wt.) was introduced as the second acceptor in the PBDB-TF:ITIC-4Cl blend, the ternary device generated a PCE of 14.18%, one of the best values for single-junction OSC devices. The performance of ternary devices was further improved by the incorporation of a small amount of near-IR absorbing trialkylsilylthiophene-substituted acceptor IN-4F into the PBDB-TF:IT-4F and PBDB-TF:BTP-4F binary blends. The devices gave PCEs of 14.9% and 16.3%, respectively, higher than that of the PBDB-TF:IN-4F binary OSC (13.1%). IN-4F showed an optical bandgap of 1.38 eV and HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.56 and −3.99 eV, which match well with those of the other components in the device. The use of IN-4F in the ternary device enabled the increase in VOC due to its high lying LUMO level compared to IT-4F and BTP-4F, and the increase in JSC because of the increase in charge mobilities and reduced recombination.
Introduction of 15 wt% 3TP3T-4F into the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F blend enhanced the PCE to 16.7% by forming a well-mixed acceptor phase and non-disruptive bicontinuous charge transport networks. Introduction of 10 wt% of a medium band gap acceptor (MF1) into the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F binary blend resulted in an impressive PCE of 17.2% (certified 16.8%). The BTP-4F:MF1 mixture formed an alloy model for efficient charge transport in the ternary blend. When 20 wt% BTP-M was added to the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F mixture, an alloy-like composite was formed between BTP-4F and BTP-M, and the ternary OSC gave an excellent PCE of 17.03% with high JSC and VOC with a film thickness of 120 nm. Most importantly, benefiting from the alloy model, the ternary device was found to maintain over 14% efficiency with active layer thicknesses up to 300 nm. Zhu and co-workers achieved a high PCE of 14.1% with a JSC of 23.1 mA cm−2 and an Eloss of 0.55 for the J71:ZITI-C:ZITI-N active layer. Using PTQ10:ZITI-N:ZITI-S-based ternary OSCs with an optimal D:A1:A2 ratio of 1:0.5:0.5, a PCE of 13.3% and a JSC of 20.93 mA cm−2 were reported.

Organic solar cells that use multiple D and A pairs have become more and more popular. In this regard, rapid progress has been made in ternary OSCs with different D and A combinations. However, expecting that the third component in ternary OSCs may not have a substantial influence on the blend morphology and absorption coverage, many groups have introduced a fourth component into ternary blends to prepare quaternary BHJ structures. Ko and co-workers achieved a PCE of 8.42% in a fullerene-based quaternary device where two polymer (PTB7 and PCDTBT) donors were mixed with PC61BM and PC71BM with an outstanding device stability of 72% after 1 year. The Taylor group reported a PCE of 10.7% for a PTB7-Th:PC71BM based quaternary device using two squaraine donors (1 wt% each) and PFN as a hole blocking layer. Recently, Ma and co-workers reported a quaternary device using two polymer donors (PBDB-T and PTB7-Th) and two complementary absorbing FFAs (ITIC and FOIC). The two FFAs worked as a parallel alloy model due to the overlapping of ITIC emission with the absorption of FOIC, establishing nonradiative energy transfer between the acceptors. The quaternary device generated a higher PCE of 12.52% compared to the ternary (11.8%) and binary (11.1%) devices. The increased JSC and FF for the quaternary device further supported the homogeneous phase separation with an efficient charge transport channel, i.e. charge dissociation and collection. The introduction of two fullerene derivatives Bis-PC70BM:PC71BM in PBDB-T:IT-M resulted in an enhanced PCE of 13%, which is superior to those of both ternary and binary devices. The introduction of PC71BM enhances the crystallinity of the PBDB-T:IT-M:Bis-PC70BM blend, resulting in enhanced charge carrier mobilities and thus increased JSC. Liu et al. achieved a PCE of 12.52% by introducing an alloy of two fullerene derivatives into the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F compositions. The results also demonstrated a good tolerance of the fullerene acceptor proportions.


The performance of organic solar cells can also be improved by stacking two BHJ cells over one another separated by an interconnecting buffer layer. The tandem structure is an effective approach to broaden the spectral coverage without increasing the loss due to the thermalization and transmission processes. The subcells in the tandem cell contain either the same D:A molecules (homotandem) or different molecules (heterotandem) absorbing in different areas of the spectrum. Mostly, the PCE of a tandem cell is similar to or slightly higher than those of the corresponding single-junction cells. The performance limitation of tandem cells is mainly due to two factors: (1) insufficient absorption, i.e. lack of low bandgap materials for rear subcells which could absorb only up to ∼900 nm, and (2) Lack of photocurrent improvement due to the overlap of the absorption regions or the mismatch of the subcells.

The D and A molecules in each subcell should exhibit complementary absorption in order to achieve high photocurrent. The VOC in the tandem cell generally is the sum of the VOCs of the two subcells. The wide bandgap BHJ layer first absorbs the lower wavelength light and then the higher wavelength light which passes through the front subcell is then absorbed by the second BHJ layer. Typically, the front subcell generates high VOC, while the rear subcell contributes to the higher JSC. The interconnection layer (ICL) in a tandem cell also plays a crucial role in the device performance. The ICL consists of p- and n-type materials between two BHJ subcells. The major requirements of the ICL are as follows: it (i) should collect and recombine holes and electrons efficiently, (ii) should be transparent in the low energy region so that the light could penetrate and be absorbed by the rear subcell, and (iii) should be stable enough to protect the front subcell during the solution deposition of the rear active layer. The choice of ICL serves as a recombination zone and plays a crucial role in efficient charge transport to the corresponding active layers. A typical tandem cell structure with various layers is presented in Fig. 32.
The tandem cell generally overcomes the issues related to the thickness of the active layer which is critical in the case of single junction binary and ternary blend OSCs. The limitation in the active layer thickness is mostly related to the low carrier mobility of organic materials. Therefore, in tandem devices stacking of two subcells with complementary absorption along with matching energy levels is very essential for light absorption and charge transport. In this section tandem cells prepared using A–D–A type heteroacene-based FFAs will be discussed.
Solution-processed tandem cells using PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO as a fullerene-free rear subcell which absorbs in the low energy region from 700 to 900 nm and PBDD4T-2F:PC71BM as a front subcell (high energy region from 300 to 700 nm) realized a PCE of 10.7% with a VOC of 1.7 V. The high VOC is the sum of the VOCs of the two subcells.
Tandem cells were prepared using complementary absorbing front (P3HT:SF(DPPB)4) and back (PTB7-Th:IEIC) subcells (Fig. 33). A thin layer of PFN was deposited over ZnO to enhance the interfacial properties. The thicknesses of the interconnecting Ag layer (5–15 nm) in MoO3/Ag/PFN and the active layer of each subcell were fine-tuned to achieve a high photovoltage of 1.97 V with an optimized PCE of 8.48%. In comparison, the corresponding single junction cells gave PCEs of 6.09% (VOC = 1.11 V) and 6.31% (VOC = 0.95 V), respectively. The EQE spectra of the tandem cell were the sum of the EQE spectrum of the front and back cells covering the region from 300 to 800 nm. Such a high photovoltage tandem cell (>1.4 V) is also important for water-splitting, suggesting its feasibility for use in solar-to-fuel conversion application.
The conventional tandem structure ITO/PEDOT:PS/PBDB-T:ITCC-M/ZnO/PCP-Na/PBDTTT-E:IEICO/PFN-Br/Al was reported, where the transparent ZnO layer collected the electrons in the ICL and the 12 nm thick pH-neutral and self-doped conductive polymer PCP-Na was used as a hole collecting layer because of its higher transparency beyond 525 nm compared to PEDOT:PSS. The front and rear subcells gave PCEs of 9.14% and 10.2% with low Elosss of 0.67 and 0.52 eV respectively. By replacing PEDOT:PSS with transparent PCP-Na as hole collecting layer, the FF of PBDTTT-E:IEICO single junction device increased from 0.58 to 0.66. The optimized tandem device achieved a high PCE of 13.8% with a VOC of 1.80 V, which was the sum of the VOCs of the two subcells, and broad photoresponse up to 900 nm.
Jen and co-workers used FFAs 6TBA and IHIC in the front and back subcells along with PTB7-Th as a donor. The PTB7-Th:6TBA in the front cell reduced the VOC (0.54 eV) and thermalization losses. On the other hand, the PTB7-Th:IHIC device alleviated the transmission losses due to the absorption edge in the near-IR region (900 nm). Both the single junction devices gave PCEs of 10.13 and 10.36%. The inverted tandem cell using optimized ZnO/PFN-Br/Ag/MoO3 as the ICL generated a PCE of 13.2%. The use of PFN-Br lowered the work function of ZnO from 4.07 to 3.78 eV and decreased the charge recombination and carrier dynamic loss. The EQE spectrum of the tandem cell covered from 400 to 900 nm. A homotandem cell using the copolymer PBDTS-TDZ as a donor and ITIC as an acceptor in an ITO/ZnO/PBDTS-TDZ:ITIC/PEDOT:PSS/ultrathin Ag/ZnO/PBDTS-TDZ:ITIC/MoO3/Ag device structure gave a PCE of 13.35% with an exceptionally high VOC of 2.13 V, the top value for any type of homotandem OSC.
The Chen group reported a PCE of 14.11%, a VOC of 1.71 V and a FF of 0.70 for a series connected tandem cell based on optimized wide bandgap PBDB-T:FDICTF-M as the front subcell and PTB7-Th:NOBDT-F as the rear subcell in an ITO/PEDOT:PS/PBDB-T:FDICTF-M/ZnO/n-PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:NOBDT-F/PDINO/Al device structure. Neutral PEDOT:PSS along with ZnO was used as the ICL and PDINO was applied as the cathode buffer layer to improve charge extraction. The front subcell contributed to high VOC, while the rear subcell balanced the JSC with photoresponse extending to 900 nm.
Forrest and co-workers developed a strategy to prepare a tandem cell using both vacuum and solution-processing techniques. They used a D–A dye DTDCPB and C70 blend in the front cell deposited by vacuum-processing and the low band gap polymer PTB7-Th donor blended with the near-IR absorbing BT-CIC acceptor in the rear cell processed from solution. The importance of multiple subcells is to adequately cover a large area of the solar spectrum. A tandem cell prepared using this combined device structure ITO/MoO3/DTDCPB:C70 (1:2)/Bphen:C60 (1:1)/AgNP/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:BT-CIC (1:1.5)/1,3,5-tri((3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl)benzene (TmPyPB)/Ag achieved a remarkable PCE of 14.3 ± 0.3% with a VOC of 1.59 V and a FF of 0.71 (for 2mm2 cells). The Bphen:C60/Ag NP/PEDOT:PSS layer was used as the ICL which acts as a charge recombination zone between the subcells. The device performance was further increased to 15.0 ± 0.3% using an anti-reflective coating. The PCE was significantly higher compared to the solution-processed binary device PTB7-Th:BT-CIC (PCE = 10.7  ± 0.2%). Furthermore, when the rear subcell was replaced with a solution-processed ternary blend (PTB7-Th:BT-CIC:TT-FIC) absorbing up to the near-IR region (1000 nm), the tandem cell generated a PCE of 15.4 ± 0.3%. This method of combining the vacuum and solution processing techniques could provide more flexibility over the current state-of-the-art all-vacuum-deposited multi-junction devices.
Very recently, Chen and co-workers achieved a record certified PCE of 17.36% (VOC = 1.64 V (JSC = 14.35 mA cm−2, FF = ∼0.74, cell size = 4 mm2) for a 2-terminal solution processed tandem OSC (ITO/ZnO/PFN-Br/PBDB-T:FDICTF-M/M-PEDOT/ZnO/PTB7-Th:Coi8DFIC:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) with an average Eloss of 0.61 eV (Fig. 34). The PBDB-T:FDICTF-M blend was used as the front subcell and the ternary blend PTB7-Th:Coi8DFIC:PC71BM as the rear subcell. In the single junction device the front cell generated a high VOC of 0.94 V (Eloss 0.71 eV) and JSC of 15.96 mA cm−2, while the rear cell gave a VOC of 0.69 V (Eloss 0.51 eV) and a high JSC of 27.60 mA cm−−2. The EQE spectra clearly resemble the film absorption spectra of the individual BHJ layers covering the range from 300 to 1050 nm (Fig. 34). In tandem devices the rear subcell contributed to the low energy photons from 720 to 1050 nm with an excellent EQE response of ∼70% from 740 to 940 nm. Interestingly, the tandem cells without PC71BM in the rear cell gave PCEs below 16% because of the relatively low JSC and FF, which could be attributed to the weaker absorption and lower EQE values from 900 to 1050 nm. This phenomenon was related to the morphological difference in the active layer caused by the PC71BM addition.

From the application point of view, the development of semitransparent OSCs (ST-OSCs) is one of the most promising approaches, which can be used in energy harvesting windows for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). To obtain semitransparency, the molecules should be nearly transparent throughout the visible region from 400 to 700 nm and absorb mostly in the near-infrared (NIR) region, since the highest sensitivity of the human eye is in the yellow-green wavelength region (500–600 nm). Specifically for window application, the average visible transmittance (AVT) should be above 25% depending on the working environment. In order to improve the transparency of OSCs, several different electrode materials, such as solution-processed graphene, silver nanowires and nanoparticles, PEDOT, dielectric layers, and composites, have been used. However, the PCEs of ST-OSCs using fullerene-based acceptors were mostly below 7% because of their limited light absorption and lower photocurrent along with low average visible transmittance (AVT). The Hou group reported a PCE of 5.7% with a high AVT of 67% for a PBDB-TF:PC71BM device. Xie et al. reported a PCE of 9.2% with 20% AVT in a ternary device based on polymer donors and the PC71BM acceptor. Hence, there is always a trade-off between the PCE and AVT in ST-OSCs. In this respect, the development of low bandgap FFAs has shown tremendous advantages because of their strong absorption in the NIR region and is the focus of the current research. A detailed account of ST-OSCs is not the focus here, and the readers are encouraged to see previous reports and reviews. However, the significance of some heteroacene-based FFAs in high performance ST-OSCs is addressed below.

Zhan and co-workers reported the first fullerene-free semitransparent OSC on a flexible substrate using the P3HT donor and the IDT-2BR acceptor and it achieved a PCE of 2.88% with an AVT of 50%. The device show better bending stability than a fullerene-based device. Later, an inverted ST-OSC using a low bandgap PBDB-T:ITIC (100 nm) blend with MoO3/Ag/MoO3 as a transparent electrode yielded an average PCE of 7.4% and AVT of 25.2%. The transparency was found to decrease with increase in the active layer thickness, and the PCE reached 6.3% with an AVT of 20% for 143 nm thickness. The authors further demonstrated that the color can be tuned by varying the thickness of the active layer as calculated by color rendering indices (CRIs).
Furthermore, ST-OSCs prepared with the PTB7-Th:ATT-2 pair reported a PCE of 7.74% with an AVT of 37% using a 20 nm thick Ag cathode. When the Ag thickness was reduced to 10 nm, the device showed a good AVT of 45% with a PCE of 6.3% and a JSC of 16.01 mA cm−2. A similar trend was observed for a ST-OSC with an ITO/ZnO/PFN/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/MoO3/Au/Ag configuration. When 20 nm Ag was used, the device exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.1% with 28.6% AVT. By reducing the Ag thickness to 10 nm, the AVT increased to 43.2% with a lower PCE of 9.4%. This device transparency represents an appreciable step toward future window integrated solar technology.
Forrest and co-workers achieved a PCE of 7.1%, with an AVT of 43 ± 2% for an inverted ST-OSC based on PTB7-Th:BT-CIC using a Ag (10 nm) cathode (Fig. 35). ST-OSCs with three different blends J52:IEICO-4Cl, PBDB-T:IEICO-4Cl, and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4Cl in an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:IEICO-4Cl/PFN-Br/Au (15 nm) device structure yielded PCEs of 6.37%, 6.24%, and 6.97% with high AVTs of 35.1%, 35.7%, and 33.5%, respectively, with different colors (Fig. 35). Furthermore, by changing the thickness of the Au electrode, the relationship between the transmittance and efficiency can be deduced in detail, and a PCE of 8.38% with an AVT of 25.6% was obtained with 30 nm Au.
Zhan and co-workers introduced a strong electron donating dithienocyclopentathieno[3,2-b]thiophene core in IHIC. The absorption band of IHIC is extended up to 900 nm with a bandgap of 1.38 eV. A blend film of PTB7-Th:IHIC showed strong absorption from 600 to 900 nm and weak absorption from 400 to 600 nm, which is the transparency requirement for ST-OSCs. The best inverted ST-OSC using a Au (1 nm)/Ag (15 nm) electrode delivered a PCE of 9.77% with the AVT approaching 36%. Moreover, a PTB7-Th:FOIC based ST-OSC gave a PCE of 10.3% with a high AVT of 37.4%, showing its potential for window applications. The authors further prepared a ST-OSC using a PTB7-Th:FNIC2 mixture, which displayed a higher PCE of 11.6% and AVT of 13.6% than PTB7-Th:FNIC1 (PCE = 9.14%, AVT = 14.7%). When the fused-undecacyclic acceptor IUIC which showed strong absorption in the 650–900 nm region was employed in ST-OSCs using PTB7-Th as a donor, the device yielded a PCE of 10.2% with an AVT of 31%, a much higher value than that of the PTB7-Th:IT-4F device (PCE = 6.42%, AVT = 28%). ST-OSCs based on PTB7-Th:IOIC3 and PTB7-Th:IOIC2 blends demonstrated PCEs of 10.8% and 7.32%, with AVT values of 16.4% and 13.1%, respectively.
A semitransparent ternary OSC was also fabricated with J71:PTB7-Th dual donors and the IHIC acceptor due to the high transparency of the blend in the visible region, showing a high PCE of 9.37% with an AVT of 21.4% and a color-rendering index approaching 100. Moreover, semitransparent flexible OSCs were also prepared using PBDB-T:PTB7-Th:IHIC as a photoactive layer, achieving PCEs up to 8.76% and a good AVT of 20.6%.
The Y14 acceptor showing strong absorption in the near-IR region extending up to 100 nm, minimizing the visible light absorption, was found to be very effective in semitransparent OSCs. A high PCE of 12.67% was achieved in a ST-OSC using the PBDB-T donor with an AVT of 23.7% after additive and TA treatment.
FFA-based ST-OSCs have shown great potential for future window applications. The device performance has significantly improved in the last few years, reaching 10% efficiency marked with good AVT. There is still some room for improvement by shifting the absorption beyond 1050 nm while keeping the energy levels suitable for charge transport with low voltage loss.

This review summarized the recent progress in solution-processed organic BHJSCs using heteroacene-based p-type and n-type A–D–A molecules. Although the PCEs of heteroacene-based p-type molecules are below 7%, the use of n-type molecules in combination with wide bandgap p-type polymer/oligomer donors has achieved excellent PCEs up to 18%. In this respect, various devices including binary, ternary and tandem structures have been developed. Different molecular design strategies such as those based on core moieties, end groups, substituents and spacers were implemented to tune their optical properties, energy levels and charge carrier mobilities. Furthermore, a solid state packing and an in-depth understanding of the charge transport properties of the molecules are very important. The current status of FFA-based devices demonstrates a bright upcoming future due to the efforts devoted towards new material design, fabrication, active layer deposition, solvent/thermal annealing, and the choice of interfacial layer. However, it is still not clear why subtle structural changes make such a huge difference in the device performance. Although a precise molecular structure–device performance relationship is difficult to achieve, it is worthwhile to deduce a tentative guideline for rational molecular design of FFAs. It will be particularly important for us to first have an in-depth understanding of the molecular properties of existing materials and correlate them with the device physics before designing new materials. With suitable knowledge on structural design and device engineering, it is not very hard to achieve PCEs >20%. Currently, the solution-processing technology is still at its primitive stage. Despite the high efficiency of solution-processed materials, their long-term stability and cost are still unresolved and challenging issues, which need to be taken care of to fully realize their potential for commercialization. In solution-processing, control over the morphology of the active layer is often complicated and crucial, which typically depends on the material composition, type of solvent, use of additives and annealing conditions. Although many FFAs have been developed showing remarkable achievements in PCE improvement, there are still several challenges for practical application of OSCs.

Heteroacene-based FFAs have emerged as workhorse materials for PCE improvement, but their synthesis seems to be complicated and expensive, specifically for longer molecules. Although high performance is important, one should also work on how to reduce the material and processing costs to reach the ultimate goal for commercialization. Therefore, it is highly desirable to design new materials with simple and efficient synthetic pathways, while still maintaining high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. In the molecular design special attention needs to be paid to side chain modification which plays a crucial role in solubility, intermolecular packing and morphological tuning. The terminal acceptor groups are also important to regulate the absorption properties and frontier orbital energy levels to provide efficient pathways for charge transport. In this respect, DCI units with F- and Cl-substituents have been found to play a remarkable role in molecular design to achieve higher PCEs.
Along with FFAs, the design of well-matched polymeric donors is also critical. High performance polymers reported so far contain benzodithiophene (BDT) units, which require longer synthetic steps, thus increasing the material cost. The temperature dependent absorption of some polymers is found to be very important to improve the device performance. Therefore, to find low-cost donor materials with strong TDA behavior and which can simultaneously form favourable morphologies with FFAs is highly desired. It is also important to find the basic mechanism for D:A interactions to further control the active layer morphologies. It is also important to design and develop efficient small molecules/oligomers with desired properties to match with FFAs for high performance OSCs and specifically to prevent batch-to-batch variations. Donor and acceptor molecules with high dipole moment and noncovalent interactions could also be explored.
For practical application, the processing of active layers is also important. Most of the high performance devices were processed from halogenated solvents. However, some non-halogenated solvents like THF and o-xylene have shown an excellent performance of 12–16%, showing a bright future of this technology. Despite small energy level offsets between the FFAs and the donor molecules/polymers the OSCs exhibited reduced energy losses, which was lacking in fullerene derivatives. In the future, it is important to find ways to further reduce the radiative (ΔE2) and non-radiative energy losses (ΔE3) to improve charge separation without sacrificing JSC and FF. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the mechanism behind these losses and develop both donor and acceptor materials with high EQEEL. In the future it is also important to solve the stability issue with appropriate encapsulation techniques. Another important parameter to enhance the efficiency is to find materials with high mobilities of 10−1–10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 if possible, which could maintain high JSC in thicker films. High PCEs of >10% have been demonstrated for solution-processed thick-film (up to 1000 nm) OSCs, showing their significant potential for future applications.
The development of heteroacene-based molecules, specifically FFAs, opens a new avenue for OSC technology and makes it a reality for practical applications. However, further efforts need to be directed towards developing low-cost and efficient p-type and n-type materials by simple chemical modification to reduce the issues related to synthetic cost, efficiency and stability. We have to wait and see how the field progresses with time for commercially viable OSCs like flexible OSCs and ST-OSCs, and its impact in our daily lives. Specifically, ST-OSCs have shown excellent performance with high PCEs having good AVTs using FFAs. Semitransparent OSCs on glass and specifically on flexible substrates could be very impressive in installing power generating windows in buildings and automobiles. Once these issues are resolved, OSCs will see a bright future for practical application.
