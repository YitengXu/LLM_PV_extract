How to design organic solar cell (OSC) systems with high device efficiency and excellent processing performance is still one of the urgent issues to be solved. Herein, we designed an asymmetric acceptor BTP-F3Cl and incorporated it into the PM1:L8-BO blend. Compared with the L8-BO neat acceptor, the L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl alloy acceptor shows larger exciton diffusion length, higher photoluminescence quantum yield and superior electron mobility. With the introduction of BTP-F3Cl, the red-shifted absorption spectra, the prolonged exciton lifetime, the enhanced charge transport property, and the depressed non-radiative recombination promote the ternary system to obtain improved short-circuit current density and fill factor. Consequently, the ternary device delivers an efficiency of 19.1% (certified as 18.7%), representing one of the highest values reported so far. Moreover, this system can achieve a promising efficiency of approximately 19% in tetrahydrofuran-processed OPV devices fabricated by a blade-coating technology. Importantly, the BTP-F3Cl-introduced ternary system can overcome the scaling lag of device efficiency more effectively than the host system. Overall, this work can effectively guide the lab-to-manufacturing translation of green printing OSCs.

Due to its advantages of light weight, solution-preparable, flexibility, wearability, and semitransparent, organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved lightning development in recent years and become one of the most promising photovoltaic research directions. However, the current power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs still lags behind perovskite solar cells and silicon solar cells, furthermore, most of the reported organic photovoltaic devices are still fabricated based on spin-coating of environmentally unfriendly halogenated solvents, which makes it face great obstacles in large-scale industrial production. As one of the commonly used effective methods for printing devices, the blade-coating method has the superior advantage of large-area preparation in air, which makes it have a huge research space, but its highest PCE still lags behind the spin-coating method. Given the above dilemma, we successfully designed a new non-fullerene acceptor BTP-F3Cl, and made it the third component to achieve a high PCE of 19.1% (one of the highest efficiencies of single-junction device). More importantly, an excellent PCE of 18.8% was achieved in the device prepared by blade-coating with green solvent tetrahydrofuran, and the blade-coating device on a large area of 1 cm2 device could still maintain 17.8% PCE, demonstrating the splendid application potential of rational ternary design strategy in overcoming the scaling lag problem.


With the emergence of novel molecular Y-series non-fullerene acceptors, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have progressively grown, reaching up to 19%. This accomplishment can also be partially attributed to appropriately modified phase separation morphologies and fine-tuned energy offsets of the donor (D) and acceptor (A) organic photovoltaic materials, which offer an efficient way to boost the PCEs of relevant OSCs with less energy loss (Eloss) and better charge transfer and transport. Apart from materials design, D/A match and morphology control of relevant binary systems, using a ternary strategy can also help the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) binary system overcome the limitations caused by energy offset and blending morphology. In general, the favorable guest materials as the third components added to the host binary system need to meet the following requirements: (1) the guest materials can establish the appropriate energy cascade alignment for charge transfer and transport or fine-tune the energetics of the associated host system for less Eloss. (2) The added third component can enhance the overall light-harvesting spectrum for achieving higher maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) and short-circuit current density (JSC) in devices. (3) The third component should have good compatibility with the host materials to achieve a favorable blend morphology for effective photo-to-electricity conversion processes. In addition to these, a ternary strategy can further improve the glass transition temperature of the BHJ binary system, thus promoting the improvement of its operation stability. These findings show that, notwithstanding the difficulties involved, carefully selecting the guest materials presents a fantastic opportunity to increase the device performance and close the OSC efficiency-stability gap.

As summarized in Table S1 (ESI), recent reports show that high-performance ternary OSCs (TOSCs) with over 19% PCEs generally were fabricated by halogenated solvents, including chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB). Inevitably, those eco-incompatible solvents would bring extra expenses in large-scale processing, to satisfy industrial regulations and waste deposition. Health and environmental advocates have long urged government agencies to tighten the use of those highly toxic halogenated solvents in large-scale production processes and called for more studies on their long-term effects in terms of the environment and human health. Moreover, most of the reported high-performance OSC systems processed by halogen-free solvents typically used spin-coating (SC) processing technology, which is only employed on the laboratory scale and accompanied by a lot of waste of solvents and active layer materials and significant scaling lag of device efficiency. Based on this view, especially in the context of the reported efficiencies of closing to the theoretical value, it is urgent to study the eco-friend preparation of OSCs with roll-to-roll (R2R) available printing techniques (e.g. doctor-blade (DB) coating and slot-die coating). Recently, the creation of organic photovoltaic materials to create highly effective OSCs utilizing halogen-free solutions, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene (Tol), and o-xylene, as well as DB/SD coating methods, has received some attention. Despite a progressive improvement in the PCE of OSCs produced using nontoxic solvents and linear coating approaches, the reported PCEs of eco-friendly fabricated OSCs are much far behind the reported high-performance OSCs as summarized in Table S1 (ESI). Note that the transition from SC technique to an ambient printing method as well as the transition from halogenated solvent processing to non-halogenated solvent processing starts the processing phase developing. During this stage of development, piloting further necessitates working entirely with non-halogenated solvent-processed organic photovoltaic materials that have great performance, while prototyping necessitates moving from small-scale cells to large-scale devices made using R2R accessible procedures. Thus, scientific issues that have been overlooked in the past, such as green manufacturing, scalable processing technology, scaling lag of efficiency, and so on, need to be highlighted and addressed at this stage of OSC development. Advanced material strategy concepts like the ternary approach could be a promising way to accompany and direct these development efforts.
In this communication, we first designed and reported an asymmetric non-fullerene small molecule acceptor BTP-F3Cl by grafting different terminal end groups, and at the same time, efficient ternary OSCs were fabricated by introducing BTP-F3Cl as the third component into the PM1:L8-BO host system. BTP-F3Cl has a distinct absorption red shift in comparison to L8-BO, similar surface tension and a higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. Due to the high compatibility and structural similarity of these two acceptors, their mixture with a weight ratio of 1:0.2 (L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl) can form alloy-like composites with excellent mixed microstructures, superior exciton diffusion length, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and electron mobility, resulting in improved carrier dynamics and reduced voltage loss in the optimized ternary blend. As a result, compared to the binary systems based on PM1:L8-BO (18.4%) or PM1:BTP-F3Cl (18.0%), the optimal ternary system (PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl = 1:1:0.2, wt%) offers an exceptional efficiency of 19.1% (certified PCE is 18.7%; National Institute of Metrology of China (NIM)). Importantly, the ternary system can also achieve a promising PCE of approximately 19% in the blade-coated OSC devices using THF as the green solvent. More importantly, we found this eco-friendly printed ternary system can effectively overcome the scaling lag of device efficiency.

By adding IC-FCl and IC-2Cl end groups, the asymmetric acceptor BTP-F3Cl was synthesized. The synthesis method (Scheme S1, ESI) and pertinent descriptions (Fig. S1–S3, ESI) of BTP-F3Cl are provided in the Experimental Section in the ESI. The chemical structures of PM1, L8-BO, and BTP-F3Cl investigated in this work are depicted in Fig. 1A. Absorption peaks at 743 and 821 nm are what define the ultraviolet-visible-NIR (UV-vis-NIR) spectra of BTP-F3Cl in diluted CF solution and neat film, as depicted in Fig. 1B. As compared to the absorption peak of L8-BO (799 nm), the BTP-F3Cl thin film had an absorption peak that was 22 nm redder, which can be attributed to the strong intermolecular arrangement in the solid state as described below. Medium band gap conjugated polymer PM6 is chosen as the donor component, which shows complementary absorption with the investigated acceptors. Moreover, the energy diagrams of the investigated materials, erected from the cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4, ESI), are depicted in Fig. 1C. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of BTP-F3Cl is −3.74 eV, which is lower than that of L8-BO (−3.66 eV). The HOMO energy level of BTP-F3Cl (−5.70 eV) lies between the HOMO energy level of PM1 (−5.52 eV) and L8-BO (−5.76 eV), forming a cascade energy structure, which is beneficial for facilitating charge transport.

The two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) measurements were performed to investigate the A/A intermolecular interactions of the acceptors. Fig. S5 (ESI) and Fig. 1D show the 2D GIWAXS patterns and line cut profiles of L8-BO and BTP-F3Cl films, respectively, which predominately have face-on orientation and good crystalline order. The excellent intermolecular interactions of BTP-F3Cl molecules, as inferred from the peak locations in related one-dimensional features (Fig. S5C, ESI), are shown by the stacking peak of BTP-F3Cl in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at 1.72 Å−1, which corresponds to the π–π stacking distance 3.65 Å and crystal coherence length (CCL) 19.50 Å (Table S2, ESI). The comparatively faint (010) stacking signals that L8-BO has, on the other hand, emerge in the OOP direction, implying the inferior molecular arrangement property in comparison to BTP-F3Cl. This result is also supported by the electron mobility data, as depicted in Fig. 1E. In comparison to L8-BO (4.80 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the neat BTP-F3Cl film exhibits higher electron mobility of 5.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Further investigation shows that introducing BTP-F3Cl into the L8-BO host acceptor can improve its electron mobility up to 6.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S6, ESI).
Given how closely their chemical structures resemble each other, both L8-BO and BTP-F3Cl should work well together to create composites that resemble alloys in relevant BHJ blends, as demonstrated by the abovementioned electron mobility data. To further illustrate whether they can form alloy-like composites, the contact angles of the corresponding neat films were calculated, as illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI). The surface tension (γ) values are determined to be 35.99, 41.44, and 43.73 mJ m−2 for the PM1, L8-BO, and BTP-F3Cl neat films, respectively (Fig. 1F). BTP-F3Cl and L8-BO have very similar surface tensions, suggesting the guest acceptor BTP-F3Cl and L8-BO may form an alloy acceptor with high probability. To test our conjecture, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) values of the related blends can be determined by applying the formula:  (K is a positive constant), where χL8-BO–BTP-F3Cl = 0.03 K is much smaller than χPM1–L8-BO = 0.19 K and χPM1–BTP-F3Cl = 0.38 K (Table S3, ESI), illustrating good miscibility between L8-BO and BTP-F3Cl. This result is also demonstrated by the PLQY measurements (see Fig. S8, ESI). In comparison to the neat L8-BO and BTP-F3Cl films (PLQY values of 6.0% and 4.9%, respectively), the L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl (1:0.2, wt%) acceptor shows a higher PLQY of 6.8%. This result further supports the formation of the alloy-like phase by showing that the coplanar conjugate system is generated in the L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl binary acceptor. It should be noted that observations from transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) are employed to more clearly depict this phenomenon. Fig. S9 (ESI) reveals the ground-state bleaching signals that emerge after photoinduced films at 800 nm along with the decay sections with varying excitation fluences. And Fig. S10 (ESI) depicts the fluence-dependent decay traces of photon-induced excitons in the corresponding neat and binary films. The calculated diffusion lengths (LD = (Dτ)1/2, where τ is the corresponding exciton lifetime and D is the diffusion coefficient factor) for L8-BO and L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl, in both, are 22.47 nm and 33.83 nm, respectively (Fig. 1G and Table S4, ESI). This signifies that the photoinduced exciton in the acceptor alloy-like phase in the solid state can spread out farther throughout the maximum exciton lifetime. Besides, the L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl (1:0.2, wt%) acceptor exhibits medium LUMO and HOMO energy levels of −3.68 and −5.73 eV (Fig. 1C), respectively, also demonstrating the formation of an alloy-like state. The lower HOMO offsets of the PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl system in comparison to the PM1:L8-BO host system should lead to more efficient charge transfer, indicative of suppressed non-radiative Eloss existed in the ternary system, which will be discussed below.
We fabricated relevant binary and ternary devices with a normal structure described in the Experimental Section and with a settled D:A weight ratio of 1:1.2 dispersed in CF, where the composition of the two acceptors varied; 0.35% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane was used as a solvent additive, and thermal annealing was performed at 100 °C for 10 min. Fig. 2A depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal binary and ternary devices under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2, Table 1 contains the detailed photovoltaic parameters. The host devices based on PM1:L8-BO shows a PCE of 18.4%, along with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.893 V, a JSC of 26.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 78.4%), which is slightly better than that of the PM1:BTP-F3Cl binary device (PCE = 18.0%, VOC = 0.844 V, JSC = 27.8 mA cm−2, and FF = 76.7%). These two binary devices exhibited excellent JSC and FF values, which indicates that both acceptors can represent appropriate active layer morphologies when paired with PM1. The optimal ternary device based on PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl with a weight ratio of 1:1:0.2 delivers the best PCE of 19.1% (VOC = 0.885 V, JSC = 27.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 79.2%). Detailed photovoltaic data for the ternary devices with different acceptor contents are summarized in Table S5 (ESI). The optimal ternary device was mailed to the NIM, China, and a certificated PCE of 18.7% (VOC = 0.872 V, JSC = 27.25 mA cm−2 and FF = 78.6%; Fig. 2B and Fig. S11, ESI) was detected, which is one of the highest certified values of single junction OSCs reported so far. The efficiency distribution histograms of twenty independently measured devices are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI), which also demonstrates the authenticity and repeatability of device performance. Fig. 2C shows the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the corresponding devices. From the curves we can visualize that all three devices show similar and strong optical responses at 400–650 nm, which is attributed to the use of PM1 as the donor. In the range of 700–950 nm, the ternary system shows a redder spectrum compared to PM1:L8-BO and a stronger spectrum compared to PM1:BTP-F3Cl. The values of 25.4, 26.4, and 26.6 mA cm−2 provided by the integrated EQE curves for the PM1:L8-BO, PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl, and PM1:BTP-F3Cl devices, respectively, are in agreement with the JSC values determined from the J–V curves.

To gain a deeper understanding of the enhanced performance parameters in the ideal ternary devices, GIWAXS techniques and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were conducted. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI), both binary blends have differentiated otherness in terms of root mean square (RMS) roughness and surface images, also supported by the various χ values (Fig. 1F). The RMS of the ternary blend was 0.91 nm lower than that of the binary blends, which suggests that the host matrix and BTP-F3Cl are thoroughly blended. Additionally, the 2D patterns of these blends show a similar molecular ordering and packing behavior that is face-on-oriented (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2E displays the line-cut intensities of the binary and ternary blends along the OOP and in-plane (IP) directions, and Table S6 (ESI) lists the corresponding morphology parameters extracted from the GIWAXS measurements. It is worth noting that the acceptor species are primarily responsible for the dominating π–π scatting peaks of these blends, which are positioned in the OOP direction around 1.71 Å−1 and display a peak at 1.67 Å−1 in the same direction for PM1. This shows that a minuscule amount of BTP-F3Cl can have a minor impact on the host system's molecular orientation. However, the addition of the BTP-F3Cl guest acceptor results in improved π–π scatting of the PM1:L8-BO system and improved molecular crystalline quality. The improved ternary system has a higher CCL value of 19.50 Å in comparison to the PM1:L8-BO host blend (18.24 Å), indicating that the presence of BTP-F3Cl promotes a higher level of molecular packing, which generally leads to better carrier dynamics in ternary devices. This is specifically possible to simultaneously improve the JSC and FF of the ternary device.
To understand the detailed carrier dynamics, we used the femtosecond (fs) TAS technique to investigate the optically generated hole transfer kinetics of all three blends. The 2D color plots of the related mixes are shown in Fig. 3A–C. Comparable ground-state bleach (GSB) signal and simulated emission of the absorption transition in the acceptors following photoexcitation are the key bleach peaks present in these binary and ternary blends. As compared with the spectra of the pristine acceptor films, clear bleach peaks of the corresponding blends can be found at 600–650 nm, matching well with the absorbing feature of the donor. The 2D color mapping analysis shows that the ternary system exhibits a more pronounced as well as a stronger intuitive signal at the donor absorption signal compared to the binary systems, implying a more efficient hole transport capability. As portrayed in Fig. 3D and Table S7 (ESI), the rising kinetics of PM1 GSB in the D/A blend films can be well fitted with a biexponential function:I = A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2 exp(−t/τ2), yielding the characteristic hole transfer lifetimes of PM1:L8-BO (τ1 = 0.57 ps and τ2 = 0.69 ps), PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl (τ1 = 0.46 ps and τ2 = 0.56 ps), and PM1:BTP-F3Cl (τ1 = 0.93 ps and τ2 = 1.14 ps). As we all know, the hole transfer process includes an ultrafast process at the interface, denoted by τ1, and a diffusion-mediated process, denoted by τ2, that is controlled by D/A domain size and aggregation. Explicitly, the ternary blend has a faster hole transfer rate than the binary blends, implying that ternary films with optimized HOMO offset and morphology have higher hole transfer efficiency. The results in the ternary blend can effectively facilitate exciton dissociation and charge generation, probably resulting in higher JSC and FF values.
To investigate the charge generation and dissociation properties in these devices, the photocurrent current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) measurements were performed, as illustrated in Fig. 3E. At a Veff of 2.0 V, Jph generally can achieve the saturation value (Jsat), with the Jsat values of 27.0 for PM1:L8-BO, 28.0 for PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl, and 28.5 mA cm−2 for PM1:BTP-F3Cl, respectively. The better JSC of the PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl device is in agreement with the fact that the Jsat value of the ternary device was greater than that of the binary devices. The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) and the exciton dissociation probability (P(E, T)) values of the binary and ternary devices can be further calculated from the Jsat and Jph using the equations of Jsat = qGmaxd and Jph = qGmaxP(E, T)d. The calculated parameters are summarized in Table S8 (ESI). The ternary device showed a larger Gmax and P(E, T) of 1.75 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 98.5%, respectively, compared with the binary devices (1.69 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 98.0% for PM1:L8-BO and 1.78 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 97.8% for PM1:BTP-F3Cl, respectively), indicating superior exciton generation and dissociation processes in the ternary blend. Additionally, we investigated the carrier mobilities of these systems via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Table S9, ESI, extracted from Fig. S14, ESI). The higher and more evenly distributed hole and electron mobilities of the ternary system in comparison to the binary systems are shown in Fig. 3F, indicating its better charge transport properties in the ternary devices. This result was further demonstrated by the photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements (Fig. S15, ESI). As presented in Fig. 3F, the ternary device has a better carrier mobility of 3.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to the binary devices (2.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM1:L8-BO and 2.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM1:BTP-F3Cl, respectively). Besides, using the transient photocurrent (TPC) technique, we investigated the charge extraction characteristics in all devices (Fig. 3G). In contrast to the binary devices, the ideal ternary system's charge extraction time is 0.30 μs faster (0.33 μs for PM1:L8-BO and 0.34 μs for PM1:BTP-F3Cl), indicating a more efficient charge extraction process in devices. These findings demonstrate the improved JSC and FF values in the optimized ternary devices.
The voltage losses of all three devices were investigated according to a reported method. The optical bandgaps, determined by the cross points of the emission and absorption spectra of blend films (Fig. S16, ESI), were calculated to be 1.457 for PM1:L8-BO, 1.434 for PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl, and 1.411 eV for PM1:BTP-F3Cl, respectively. As compared to the PM1:L8-BO (0.564 eV) and PM1:BTP-F3Cl (0.567 eV) devices, the ternary device exhibits a lower Eloss of 0.549 eV (Table S10, ESI). Furthermore, it was established that the radiative recombination losses for relevant devices, were 0.108, 0.107, and 0.105 eV below the bandgap, by fitting the reduced spectra of Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) and electroluminescence (EL) (Fig. S17, ESI). The non-radiative voltage loss (ΔE3) values for PM1:L8-BO, PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl, and PM1:BTP-F3Cl were further calculated to be 0.198, 0.186, and 0.207 eV, respectively (Fig. 3H), also supported by the EL quantum efficiency measurements. According to Fig. 3I, the associated devices had EQEEL values of 3.58 × 10−4, 5.65 × 10−4, and 2.45 × 10−4, consequently, several ΔE3 values were obtained, ranging from 0.205 eV for PM1:L8-BO to 0.193 eV for PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl to 0.215 eV for PM1:BTP-F3Cl, respectively. Among these three systems, the ternary devices have the lowest ΔE3 value when compared to the other binary devices, this result indicates less non-radiative recombination loss. Also demonstrated by the measurements of VOCversus light intensity (Fig. S18, ESI) and transient photovoltage (Fig. S19, ESI). The ternary devices have a lower slope of 1.25 kT/q (where q is the elemental charge, k is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvins) and a longer carrier time of 9.7 μs as compared to the binary devices (1.34 kT/q and 6.6 μs for PM1:L8-BO and 1.45 kT/q and 5.3 μs for PM1:BTP-F3Cl, respectively). Overall, contrasted to binary systems, the ternary blend with a well-mixed phase exhibits more effective photo-to-electricity conversion processes.
As mentioned in the introduction section, the fabrication of devices with halogen-free solvents and R2R-available processing techniques is the only way for OSC to move towards its industrial viability. Based on this point, we further constructed the PM1:L8-BO:BTP-F3Cl devices fabricated by the doctor-blade coating technique (Fig. 4A) and the green solvent THF. Fig. 4B displays the J–V characteristics of the ternary devices processed by various solvents and processing techniques and the related photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2. As compared to the SC-based ternary devices processed by CF (19.1%), the DB-based ternary devices show a lower PCE of 18.6% (VOC = 0.882 V, JSC = 27.3 mA cm−2, and FF = 77.2%). Notably, the related devices processed by THF in contrast show a better PCE of 18.8% (VOC = 0.876 V, JSC = 27.4 mA cm−2, and FF = 78.4%). These results demonstrate that this ternary system is insensitive to processing techniques, similar to the host system on the one hand (Fig. S20 and Table S11, ESI). On the other hand, in the DB process, green solvent THF is more suitable for the film formation of this ternary system. Furthermore, using THF as the processing solvent, we fabricated the large-scale ternary devices with active areas of 0.2 and 1.0 cm2, as exhibited in Fig. 4C. The blade-coated devices exhibited the PCEs of 18.2% (VOC = 0.888 V, JSC = 27.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 75.4%) for 0.2 cm2 and 17.8% (VOC = 0.880 V, JSC = 27.3 mA cm−2 and FF = 74.2%) for 1.0 cm2, respectively, illustrating the favorable morphologies with large-scale. Fig. 4D shows well the efficiency distribution obtained for different active layer areas prepared by blade-coating treated with THF. Notably, as compared to the 0.05 cm2 ternary device, the large-scale devices showed inferior values, indicating the inherent scaling lag issue. This phenomenon is also found in the host system fabricated by the DB techniques using THF as the processing solvent (Fig. 4D). The relevant detailed photovoltaic performance results are presented in Fig. S21 and Table S12 (ESI). Further analysis found that the THF-coated host binary devices showed more obvious device performance losses in comparison to the ternary devices when the relevant device active area increases gradually, as depicted in Fig. 4E, the PCE loss rate of the ternary system is significantly lower than that of the binary system, only 3.2% and 5.4% at 0.2 cm2 and 1.0 cm2, while the binary system is 4.1% and 9.4%, respectively, indicating that the scaling lag is well overcome. This result strongly demonstrates this ternary strategy can effectively overcome the scaling lag of device efficiency and indicate that the ternary strategy is a promising way to promote the effective preparation of large-area OSC devices. Importantly, as shown in Fig. 4F (extracted from Table S13, ESI), the achieved PCE of approximately 19% in the THF-processed ternary devices is the highest value in the DB-based OSCs.

In summary, we designed a new asymmetric acceptor BTP-F3Cl and introduced it into the PM1:L8-BO binary system for successfully fabricating a high-performance ternary system. The optimal ternary system delivers a PCE of over 19% (certified value of 18.7%), which is one of the best photovoltaic performances for OSCs ever reported. This outstanding result is associated with the broader light-harvesting spectrum, improved PLQY values, longer exciton diffusion distance, and highly similar structures of L8-BO and BTP-F3Cl work in unison via an alloy-like acceptor in the ternary system. Relative to the PM1:L8-BO host system under ideal circumstances, enhanced hole transfer, effective charge transport and extraction properties, and suppressed non-geminate recombination were observed in the ternary OSCs with reduced energy loss, resulting in superior photovoltaic performance. Further investigation found that this ternary system is probably insensitive to processing solvents and technologies, supported by the high PCEs of approximately 19% achieved in the DB-based ternary devices processed by green solvent THF. Surprisingly, apart from the selection of processing solvent and technique, there is also a clear advantage of the ternary system over the binary system in large-area coating treatment, demonstrating that the introduction of a reasonable third component can overcome the scaling lag of device efficiency in its processing. In summary, this work not only shows that the introduction of a reasonable third component can enhance the photovoltaic performance of the host system, well maintain the solvent and process tolerance, and effectively overcome the scaling lag of device performance, but also provide a promising way to guide the lab-to-manufacturing translation of green printing OSCs.
