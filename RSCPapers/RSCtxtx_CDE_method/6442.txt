A large-bandgap donor, BTBR-2F, based on noncovalent conformational locking has been designed and synthesized to achieve more complementary absorption with a PM6:Y6 blend in the near-ultraviolet region. The ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F achieves the best morphology with a nanofibrous network structure and small domain size, which results in the most efficient exciton dissociation, highest charge mobilities, and lowest charge recombination. Moreover, BTBR-2F possesses lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels than PM6, which leads to more efficient energy/charge transfer and higher Voc in ternary OSCs. Therefore, the ternary device with 20% BTBR-2F achieves the highest efficiency of 17.38%, with a Voc of 0.859 V, Jsc of 27.30 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.11%. The study presents an efficient noncovalent conformational locking strategy to tune the energy levels, absorption band and molecular aggregation of a small molecular donor for high-performance ternary organic solar cells with comprehensively improved photovoltaic parameters.

With the rapid development of active materials, up-to-date single-junction organic solar cells (OSCs) have made a significant breakthrough with over 17% power conversion efficiency (PCE). In the last two years, PM6:Y6-based OSCs have been considered as some of the most representative OSCs. Based on these systems, a series of strategies have been developed to further improve their performance, such as optimizing the polymeric structure, tuning small-molecular acceptors and introducing a third component.

Compared with binary devices, ternary organic solar cells (TOSCs) easily achieve improved Jsc (short-circuit current density) values for more complementary absorption spectra and optimized morphology, enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) for a larger energy gap between the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level of the donor and the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level of the acceptor, and strengthened fill factor (FF) for higher and more balanced charge mobilities in ternary blend films. Accordingly, these TOSCs present higher PCE values over 17% than the corresponding binary OSCs. A large proportion of TOSCs have been constructed with two acceptor materials. Usually, PCBM and some non-fullerene acceptors can easily achieve high performance when they are used as the second acceptors because of more complementary absorption spectra in long-wave bands and an efficient energy level cascade. Compared with TOSCs with two acceptors, TOSCs based on two donors have been obviously paid less attention because it is more difficult to coordinate the contradiction between absorption spectra and energy levels for donor materials. An et al. reported the ternary copolymer donor S3 based on PM6 which presents a similar absorption spectrum to PM6, and the S3-based TOSCs show higher Jsc, FF and PCE values than those of the binary OSCs because of the well-developed morphology and improved mobilities. Several small-molecular donors have been introduced as the second donors in TOSCs based on PM6:Y6, but the PCE values rarely exceed 17%. Ge's group developed a small molecule, SM1, as the second donor to construct TOSCs, which presents an increased PCE of 16.55% for optimized morphology, improved exciton dissociation and charge extraction. Recently, Li's group used a small molecular donor, BPR-SCl, as the third component to prepare TOSCs, and BPR-SCl improves the molecular packing, promotes exciton disintegration and improves the charge mobility, so the PCE increased to 16.74%. By and large, these small molecules play a key role in improving the morphology of ternary blend films and providing more efficient charge and/or energy transfer in TOSCs, which are beneficial to Jsc, FF, Voc and PCE values. However, most of these small molecules have too much overlap in their absorption spectra with that of PM6, which limits light harvesting in the near-ultraviolet region and even Jsc values.
Noncovalent conformational locking is an efficient strategy to construct organic semiconductors through more convenient synthetic steps, and their conjugated molecules also present a coplanar structure as fused-core molecules and achieve efficient intermolecular packing. In view of the above, a new small-molecular donor, BTBR-2F (Scheme 1), based on a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) derivative as an electron-donating core, two octylthiophene-2,5-difluorobenzene-octylthiophene units as π bridges and two 3-ethylrhodanine units as electron-withdrawing terminal groups was designed and synthesized in order to tune its absorption in the near-ultraviolet wave band and energy levels (Scheme S1). Moreover, its noncovalent conformational locking would make for weak aggregation in solution and more orderly intermolecular packing in film, which would be beneficial to forming good morphology in a ternary blend film and improving the photovoltaic performance of TOSCs. Therefore, the TOSCs based on BTBR-2F show comprehensively improved photovoltaic parameters in comparison to the binary devices. The TOSC with 20 wt% BTBR-2F achieved the best PCE of 17.38% with a Voc of 0.859 V, Jsc of 27.30 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.11%, which increased by nearly 14% compared to that of the PM6:Y6-based binary device. It should be one of the highest PCEs in TOSCs with a small-molecular donor as the third component to our knowledge.

The chemical structure of BTBR-2F is illustrated in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthetic pathway of BTBR-2F is presented in the ESI (Scheme S2). The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% wt loss) of BTBR-2F determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is 402 °C (Fig. S10), which indicates that BTBR-2F possesses good thermal stability for application in OSCs. Fig. 1a shows the normalized absorption spectra of BTBR-2F in solution and thin film; the absorption maximum (λsolmax) of BTBR-2F is located at 491 nm in chloroform solution, which is attributed to a π–π* transition. Compared to the absorption spectrum in solution, the BTBR-2F film exhibits a redshifted absorption spectrum with two peaks. The peaks at 525 nm and 575 nm could be ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer and intermolecular π–π packing, respectively. That is to say, BTBR-2F can't form strong intermolecular aggregation in solution because single bond rotation could result in a nonplanar conformation, but it could form strong intermolecular π–π stacking in film because noncovalent conformational locking and restricted molecular rotation would lead to sufficient coplanar conformation. The absorption edge of BTBR-2F is located at 636 nm, indicating an optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.95 eV (Table 1), which is larger than that of PM6 (1.81 eV). Therefore, BTBR-2F shows a more complementary absorption band from 400 nm to 550 nm compared with the reported DR3TBTT and BPR-SCI, which would be more beneficial for photon harvesting in the short band and as well as higher photoproduced current in the TOSCs.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to estimate the energy levels of BTBR-2F and PM6 by using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) (0.43 eV versus Ag/AgCl) as an internal standard (Fig. S11). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BTBR-2F are −5.50 eV and −3.36 eV, respectively, which were obtained from the oxidation/reduction potentials (1.13 eV/−1.01 eV) (Fig. 1b). Compared with DR3TBDTT, BTBR-2F has a lower-lying HOMO energy level due to the electron-deficient properties of p-difluorobenzene, which would also be theoretically good for higher Voc in OSCs. Besides, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PM6 were evaluated to be −5.41 and −3.31 eV (Fig. S11), respectively. Obviously, BTBR-2F possesses lower-lying HOMO and LUMO levels than PM6, which enables the active layer materials (PM6:BTBR-2F:Y6) to form an efficient energy level cascade, which would help the ternary devices to achieve more efficient charge transfer, less charge recombination, higher Voc and larger Jsc in comparison with the PM6:Y6 binary devices.
To explore the photovoltaic properties of BTBR-2F, binary and ternary OSCs were fabricated with the structure ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al. All devices were fabricated by spin coating chloroform solution with a total concentration of 13.2 mg mL−1 and a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1, in which the content of BTBR-2F is defined as the weight ratio of BTBR-2F to the total weight of BTBR-2F and PM6. The J–V (current density–voltage) curves of the binary OSCs and the TOSC with 20% BTBR-2F are shown in Fig. 2a, and the J–V curves of the other TOSCs are shown in Fig. S12.
Compared with the Voc (0.831 V) of the binary OSC based on PM6:Y6, the Voc values of the TOSCs gradually increase from 0.848 V to 0.885 V when the content of BTBR-2F in donors increases from 10% to 50% (Table 2). It is understandable that the HOMO level of BTBR-2F (−5.50 eV) is lower than that of PM6 (−5.41 eV), so the Voc values increase with the increase of BTBR-2F content. It is counterintuitive that the binary OSC based on BTBR-2F:Y6 shows the lowest Voc of 0.800 V; this could be a result of strong exciton recombination and poor charge extraction due to poor phase morphology. The Jsc of the OSC based on PM6:Y6 is 26.30 mA cm−2, which increases to 27.46 mA cm−2 when the BTBR-2F content is 10% because BTBR-2F is beneficial for higher light harvesting in the short-wave band. However, the Jsc values of the TOSCs slowly decrease with further increase of BTBR-2F content because lower-content PM6 also leads to lower light harvesting in the medium-wave band. The binary BTBR-2F:Y6 OSC shows the lowest Jsc of 20.69 mA cm−2, which could be due to weakened absorption in the medium-wave band and poor morphology. Moreover, the TOSC with 20% BTBR-2F presents a higher Jsc (27.30 mA cm−2) than that of the binary OSC (PM6:Y6) because the former presents a higher EQE response in the band between 350 and 550 nm (Fig. 2b). The integrated Jsc values estimated from EQE curves are 25.25, 19.31, and 26.50 mA cm−2 for the OSCs based on PM6:Y6, BTBR-2F:Y6, and the ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F, respectively, which are similar to the measured Jsc values in the permitted range of error. The binary OSCs based on PM6:Y6 and BTBR-2F:Y6 blend films present fill factors (FFs) of 70.05% and 41.26%, but the TOSCs with low content of BTBR-2F show higher FF values, which could be attributed to less charge recombination in ternary blend films. The FF value reaches the maximum value of 74.11% when the BTBR-2F content is 20%. As a result, TOSCs with BTBR-2F contents of 10%, 20% and 30% show PCE values of 16.88%, 17.38% and 15.90%, respectively, which are higher than those of binary OSCs based on PM6:Y6 (15.31%) and BTBR-2F:Y6 (6.83%).

The morphologies of the binary blend films and the ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F were analyzed by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are shown in Fig. 3 to estimate the effects of BTBR-2F on performance. The blend films based on PM6:Y6, PM6:BTBR-2F:Y6 and BTBR-2F:Y6 all display a smooth surface with root mean square roughness values of 1.25, 0.60 and 0.30 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a–c), which indicate that these active layers would have good interface contact with the charge transport layers and electrode. The PM6:Y6 blend film displays a phase image of bicontinuous nanophase separation with domain sizes of about 20–30 nm (Fig. 3d), while the ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F exhibits a nanofibrous network structure with smaller domain sizes of about 10–20 nm (Fig. 3e). However, the BTBR-2F:Y6 blend film presents a sea–island nanophase separation with the largest domain size in these blend films (Fig. 3f). These results indicate that the ternary blend film contributes to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport than the binary blend films, but the BTBR-2F:Y6 blend film possesses the worst exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, the TOSC with 20% BTBR-2F shows the highest Jsc, FF, and PCE values, but the binary BTBR-2F:Y6 OSC shows the lowest Jsc, FF, and PCE values.
Molecular packing in films has been characterized by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. 4 and S13 show the 2D-GIWAXS diagrams of BTBR-2F, PM6, and Y6 films. The PM6 film shows (100) and (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP (out-of-plane) direction; the Y6 film also shows a (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction (Fig. S13) which is consistent with the reported result. As shown in Fig. 4a, the neat BTBR-2F film shows a strong (100) peak at 0.35 Å−1, a (200) peak at 0.70 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a weak (010) peak at 1.71 Å−1 in the IP (in-plane) direction. These results indicate that BTBR-2F prefers to form an edge-on oriented packing in neat film. The PM6:Y6 blend film shows a strong (010) peak at 1.74 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a strong (100) peak at 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction (Fig. 4b), indicating the formation of a preferential face-on orientation. The ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F presents a strong (010) peak at 1.75 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a (100) peak at 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction (Fig. 4c), which is similar to that of the PM6:Y6 blend film because of its good compatibility with the PM6:Y6 blend film. Simultaneously, the ternary blend film shows a stronger 100 peak than the PM6:Y6 blend film in the OOP direction, which indicates that BTBR-2F is beneficial for improving the molecular arrangement. Moreover, the orientation of BTBR-2F is changed from edge-on to face-on in the ternary blend film compared with the pristine BTBR-2F film, and the ternary blend film presents a smaller π–π stacking distance (3.59 Å) than that of the binary blend film (3.61 Å), which are favourable for charge transport. Therefore, the TOSC shows the highest Jsc, FF, and PCE values. Moreover, the BTBR-2F:Y6 blend film exhibits weak (010) peaks at 1.75 Å−1 in the OOP direction and IP direction (Fig. 4d), which indicates that this blend film forms weak and less orderly molecular packing, which is harmful for charge transport, so the OSC based on BTBR-2F:Y6 shows the lowest photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. S14, the acceptor domain sizes of the PM6:Y6 blend film and the ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F are estimated to be 23 and 18 nm, respectively, by fitting the horizonal grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) profiles with conventional models, which confirm the AFM results. Therefore, the ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F possesses more efficient exciton dissociation compared with the binary blend film, and the corresponding TOSC shows higher Jsc and FF values.
To investigate the compatibility of BTBR-2F with PM6 and Y6, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was utilized to characterize the melting and crystallization behavior of BTBR-2F and its binary blends. As shown in Fig. 5a and S15a, BTBR-2F shows a melting peak at 222 °C (ΔH = 26.0 J g−1) and a crystallization peak at 204 °C (ΔH = 24.0 J g−1), and PM6 does not show any obvious melting and crystallization peaks in the range of measured temperature. The mixture of PM6 and BTBR-2F (PM6:BTBR-2F, w/w = 4:1) also does not show the melting and crystallization peaks of the BTBR-2F, which suggests that BTBR-2F should be completely miscible with PM6 in this case. Y6 possesses a phase transformation peak at 257 °C (ΔH = 5.07 J g−1) and a melting peak at 298 °C (ΔH = 33.34 J g−1) (Fig. 5b), and its crystallization peak is located at 204 °C (ΔH = 4.68 J g−1). However, the phase transformation peak and the melting peak of Y6 in the mixture of Y6 and BTBR-2F (Y6:BTBR-2F, w/w = 5:1) decreases to 249 °C (ΔH = 2.92 J g−1) and 286 °C (ΔH = 14.63 J g−1), respectively, and the enthalpy changes also reduce by nearly half though the addition of BTBR-2F is only one sixth in the mixture. Moreover, the mixture shows an indistinct broad peak at about 172 °C, which could be the melting peak of BTBR-2F. That is to say, BTBR-2F and Y6 are partially compatible in the mixture since they present apparently reduced melting and crystallization temperature. Moreover, Y6 presents a higher melting point of 288 °C with a larger enthalpy change of 18.68 J g−1 in the ternary blend compared to the BTBR-2F:Y6 blend (Fig. S15c), which gives further proof that less BTBR-2F is dispersed in the Y6 domain in the ternary blend film. As a result, most of the BTBR-2F should be dispersed in the PM6 domain, and a portion of BTBR-2F forms an alloy with Y6 in the two-phase interface of PM6 and Y6 in ternary blend films, which would contribute to better nanophase separation and phase domain size (Fig. 3e), so the TOSC with 20% BTBR-2F shows the highest charge mobility and best photovoltaic performance.
To further understand the compatibility of BTBR-2F with PM6 and Y6, the contact angles of water and ethylene glycol drops on PM6, BTBR-2F, and Y6 pure films were measured (Fig. 5c). The contact angles of water and ethylene glycol drops on PM6 are 93.75° and 72.00°, respectively, the contact angles on BTBR-2F are 93.75° and 71.50°, respectively, and the contact angles on Y6 are 89.50° and 64.25°, respectively. Therefore, the surface tensions (γ) of PM6, BTBR-2F and Y6 are calculated according to the Owens–Wendt–Kaelble equation to be 21.84, 22.60, and 27.17 mN m−1, respectively (Table S3). The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) value between PM6 and BTBR-2F (χPM6:BTBR-2F) was 0.006, χPM6:Y6 was 0.290, and χBTBR-2F:Y6 was 0.210; the smaller value of χPM6:BTBR-2F suggests the good compatibility between PM6 and BTBR-2F, which is consistent with DSC test results.
To study the influence of BTBR-2F on the performance of the ternary device, the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was utilized to measure the charge mobilities of the blend films (Fig. S16). The PM6:Y6-based device shows a hole mobility (μh) of 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility (μe) of 2.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table S4), which increase with the increase of BTBR-2F content. The ternary device with 20% BTBR-2F content presents the highest μh of 8.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, the highest μe of 7.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the most balanced charge mobilities with a μh/μe ratio of 1.02 since its blend film possesses the best morphology, so the TOSC with 20% BTBR-2F shows the highest Jsc, FF and PCE values. Both electron and hole mobilities of the ternary device decrease with further increasing BTBR-2F content, reaching the lowest μh of 3.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the lowest μe of 2.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the BTBR-2F content is 100% due to its inferior morphology and less face-on molecular packing. Therefore, the binary OSC based on BTBR-2F:Y6 shows the lowest Jsc, FF and PCE values.
To explore the exciton dissociation and electron transfer behavior between PM6 and BTBR-2F, photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PM6, BTBR-2F and their blend films were recorded (Fig. 6a), with excitation at 525 nm. BTBR-2F and PM6 pure films and the PM6:BTBR-2F (w/w = 4:1) blend film show emission peaks at 670 nm, 689 nm, and 686 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the maximum fluorescence intensity of the blend film (PM6:BTBR-2F, w/w = 4:1) is obviously lower than those of BTBR-2F and PM6 films, which indicates that the fluorescence has been quenched in the blend film. Simultaneously, the blend film (PM6:BTBR-2F, w/w = 4:1) also shows obvious fluorescence quenching compared with the pristine films when it is excited at 600 nm (Fig. S17), which is the maximum overlap absorption wavelength of PM6 and BTBR-2F and does not result in too much overlap between the excitation spectrum and emission spectrum. That is to say, there should be charge transfer between PM6 and BTBR-2F (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of the ternary blend film with 20% BTBR-2F is obviously lower than that of the binary PM6:Y6 blend film, which suggests that the ternary blend is more beneficial for the formation of charge transfer excitons, which would further contribute to enhanced Jsc values. Moreover, the cascade distribution of the energy level would also contribute to reducing the energy barrier of charge transfer between donors and Y6, inhibiting exciton recombination.
To verify whether charge recombination in TOSC is reduced, the dependences of Voc and Jsc as a function of the natural logarithm of light intensity (Plight) were characterized and are shown in Fig. 6b and c, respectively. The slopes of the Voc–Plight curves in the binary and ternary devices are 1.23KT/q and 1.07KT/q (K is Boltzmann's constant), respectively. In other words, monomolecular and trap-assisted recombination has been more efficiently inhibited in the TOSC compared with the binary OSC. As shown in Fig. 6c, the dependence of Jsc on Plight is described as Jsc ∝ Plightα; the calculated α values of the binary and ternary OSCs are 0.968 and 0.998, respectively, which indicates that bimolecular recombination has been more effectively suppressed in the TOSC. The Jph–Veff (photocurrent density–effective voltage) plots were also surveyed (Fig. 6d). The charge collection probability P(E, T) values of the binary and the ternary devices, which could be estimated from the ratio of Jsc value and current density under saturated conditions, are 0.84 and 0.86, respectively, indicating more efficient exciton dissociation, charge extraction and charge collection in the TOSC, which result in improved Jsc, FF, and PCE values.

In conclusion, a large-bandgap donor, BTBR-2F, based on noncovalent conformational locking was designed and synthesized, which not only possesses strong absorption in the near-ultraviolet region but also improves the morphology of a ternary blend film as well as charge transfer among three components. Moreover, the TOSC with 20% BTBR-2F possesses more efficient exciton dissociation, higher charge mobilities, higher quantum efficiency in the near-ultraviolet region and less charge recombination compared with the binary OSCs, so it presents the highest PCE of 17.38% with a Voc of 0.859 V, Jsc of 27.30 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.11%, which are comprehensively higher than those of the binary PM6:Y6 device. Overall, this work provides a noncovalent conformational locking strategy to tune the energy levels, absorption band and molecular aggregation of a small molecular donor, which can be used to prepare high-performance TOSCs and comprehensively improve photovoltaic parameters.
