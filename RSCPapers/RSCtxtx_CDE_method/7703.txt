Five new poly(selenophene–thiophene) polymers, including PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT, were synthesized via Stille coupling polymerization and used various π-conjugated spacers of vinylene (V), thiophene (T), bithiophene (2T), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT). Tuneable structural, optical, and electrochemical properties of polymers were observed because different π-conjugated building blocks in the main polymer chain affected the conformation of the polymer backbone. Details of polymer morphologies were systematically investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). P2Se4TTT possessed the smallest energy band gap, densest molecular packing structure as well as fibrillar-like nanostructures among the studied polymers because the TT moiety could enhance the coplanarity of the polymer backbone and the inserted biselenophene reduced the hindrance of thiophene side chains. Hence, the highest field-effect mobility of this set of polymers was determined to be 0.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 from a P2Se4TTT-based field-effect transistor device with a high on/off ratio over 105. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the photovoltaic cells based on polymer/PCBM blends were in the range of 0.43%–1.18% for our synthesized polymers. Among them, the P2Se4TTT-based device could achieve the best PCE of 2.29% using a o-dichlorobenzene–1,8-diiodooctane (98:2 v/v) mixture as the processing solvent. The enhancement of active layer uniformity responded to the increment of efficiency. The abovementioned results demonstrated that the newly designed polymers could serve as promising candidates for optoelectronic device applications of polymers.

Polymeric semiconductors have received extensive scientific interest for use in organic optoelectronic devices in recent years because of their potential advantages, such as low cost, solution processability, good flexibility and stretchability, over inorganic or organic small-molecular semiconductors. For these reasons, semiconducting polymers offer opportunities to impact current industrial technologies and develop next-generation organic electronics as demonstrated by polymer photovoltaic cells (PVs), field-effect transistors (FETs), and memory devices in current research.

Side chains are a crucial component in the design of novel conjugated polymers. They not only directly relate to the solubility but also affect the molecular packing motifs and thin film morphologies. Alkyl side chains with different branching structures or functionalized groups have been already investigated. On the other hand, side chains, including conjugated moieties, are also exhibited, which can further enhance the absorption range and the charge carrier mobility for device applications. Li et al. have evaluated various conjugated side chains, e.g. bi(thienylenevinylene), phenothiazinevinylene, or bi(phenylenevinylene), incorporated into the thiophene backbone to facilitate the extension of π-electron delocalization and broad absorption. Moreover, our group has discovered a series of biaxially extended conjugated thiophene-based polymers, which possess high carrier mobility (up to 0.61 cm2 V−1 s−1) and solar cell efficiency (up to 4.04%).
In addition, high performance polymer FET and PV devices have recently been explored using selenophene rings to replace thiophene rings. The incorporation of selenophene provides the chance to enhance the chain interaction and carrier transport ability because selenium generally exhibits a stronger heteroaromatic interaction than sulfur. Park et al. reported that poly(5,5′-bis(3-dodecylthiophene-2-yl)-2,2′-biselenophene) exhibited considerably better carrier mobility and power conversion efficiency compared to thiophene-based poly(3,3′′-didodecyl quaterthiophene). In addition, one of the highest hole mobilities (higher than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the conjugated polymer community was observed in the selenophene-containing polymer, which was explored by Kim and coworkers. Thus, combining the advantages of selenium atoms in the polymer backbone and conjugated thiophene units on polymer side chains may result in materials with strong intermolecular interactions, broad absorption, good charge carrier mobility, and high power conversion efficiency.
In this study, new conjugated materials using selenophene-containing main chain and conjugated thiophene side chains, Se4T and 2Se4T, were developed. After copolymerizing with different π-conjugating spacers, including vinylene (V), thiophene (T), bithiophene (2T), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), using Stille coupling reactions under microwave heating, five semiconducting polymers, poly((E)-5-dodecyl-2′-(5-(5-dodecyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-2′-yl)selenophen-2-yl)-5′-(prop-1-en-1-yl)-2,3′-bithiophene) (PSe4TV), poly(5′′-dodecyl-5′-(5-(5-dodecyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-2′-yl)selenophen-2-yl)-2,2′:4′,2′′-terthiophene) (PSe4TT), poly(5′′′-dodecyl-5′′-(5-(5-dodecyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-2′-yl)selenophen-2-yl)-2,2′:5′,2′′:4′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene) (PSe4T2T), poly(2-(5-dodecyl-2′-(5-(5-dodecyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-2′-yl)selenophen-2-yl)-[2,3′-bithiophen]-5′-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PSe4TTT), and poly(2-(5-dodecyl-2′-(5′-(5-dodecyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-2′-yl)-[2,2′-biselenophen]-5-yl)-[2,3′-bithiophen]-5′-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (P2Se4TTT), were explored (Scheme 1). The synthesis, optical, electrochemical, and optoelectronic device characteristics were explored. In addition, the film morphology was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). The charge carrier transport ability of the studied polymers was obtained using top-contact/bottom-gate FETs. Moreover, polymer PV cells were fabricated with a sandwiched ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/Ca/Al device configuration. The effects of selenium atom in polymer chain, conjugated thiophene rings on side chains, and various spacer moieties on the performance of FETs and PVs were systematically examined.

3-Bromothiophene, 2-bromothiophene, selenophene, trimethyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane, (E)-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethene (V), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine, and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) were purchased from Aldrich (Missouri, USA) and used without further purification. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) was purchased from TCI (Tokyo, Japan) and used as received. Common organic solvents (tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and dimethylformamide) for synthesis and anhydrous solvents (such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene) for device applications were purchased from Aldrich (Missouri, USA). Monomers, including 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (T), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-dithiophene (2T), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-selenophene (Se), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-biselenophene (2Se), were synthesized according to the procedures in previous studies. The syntheses steps of newly designed selenophene-quarterthiophene (Se4T) and biselenophene-quarterthiophene (2Se4T) compounds are shown in Scheme S1 and summarized in ESI (Fig. S1–S8). A surface treatment agent, octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS), was purchased from Acros (Geel, Belgium) for field-effect transistor characterization. [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from Solenne BV (Groningen, The Netherlands) and Alfa Aesar (Massachusetts, USA), respectively, for photovoltaic cell applications.


The general procedure for synthesizing Se4T- and 2Se4T-based conjugated copolymers (PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, P2Se4TTT) is depicted in Scheme 1. Dibromo monomers (Se4T or 2Se4T), ditin monomers (V, T, 2T or TT), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (16 mol% with respect to ditin monomer), and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (2 mol% with respect to ditin monomer) were dissolved in a microwave vessel using 5 ml chlorobenzene under a nitrogen atmosphere. The vessel was then sealed with a snap cap and the mixture was polymerized under microwave heating at 160 °C for 30–60 min. After being end-capped with 2-(tributylstynnyl)-thiophene and 2-bromothiophene (both 1.1 equiv. with respect to ditin monomer and under microwave heating at 170 °C for 10 min for the end-capping), the mixture was cooled and poured into methanol to form a crude polymer. The crude polymer was purified using a Soxhlet apparatus with methanol, acetone, and hexane to remove oligomers and catalyst residues. The final product was obtained after drying in vacuum at 40 °C.

Microwave polymerization was carried out using a Biotage microwave reactor in sealed vessels. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance DRX-400 MHz spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) analysis was performed using a Lab Alliance RI2000 instrument (two column, MIXED-C and D from Polymer Laboratories) connected with one refractive index detector from Schambeck SFD Gmbh. All GPC analyses were performed on polymer–THF solutions at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 at 40 °C and then calibrated with polystyrene standards. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using the TA instruments (Q-50 and Q-100), respectively. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were carried out using beamline BL-17A1 in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. An X-ray wavelength of 1.321 Å was used and the incident angle was 0.12°. The scattering intensities are reported as intensity versus q, where q = (4π/λ) sin(θ/2), λ is the wavelength of incident X-rays, and θ is the scattering angle. UV–Vis absorption spectrum was explored using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. For the thin film spectra, polymers were first dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (12 mg ml−1), followed by filtering through a 0.45 μm pore size PTFE membrane syringe filter, and then spin-coated at a speed rate of 800 rpm for 60 s onto quartz substrate. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI 611B electrochemical analyzer using a three-electrode cell, in which ITO (polymer films area were about 0.5 × 0.7 cm2) was used as a working electrode. A platinum wire was used as an auxiliary electrode. All cell potentials were taken with the use of a homemade Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat.) reference electrode. The electrochemical properties of the polymer films were detected under 0.1 M dry acetonitrile solution containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as the electrolyte. The morphology of polymer film surface was obtained with a Nanoscope 3D Controller atomic force microscope (AFM, Digital Instruments (Santa Barbara, CA)) operated in the tapping mode at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1230 instrument operating at a voltage of 200 keV with a Gatam dual vision CCD camera. Note that the preparation of polymer thin film samples was the same as that of the device fabrications for the measurements of GIXD, UV, AFM, and TEM.


The field-effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated using the studied copolymers with a top-contact configuration. A 300 nm SiO2 layer (capacitance per unit area = 10 nF cm−2) as a gate dielectric was thermally grown onto the highly n-type doped Si (100) substrates. A silane coupling agent, octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS), was used to modify SiO2 layer using the following preparation procedure: the cleaned wafers were immersed in a 10 mM solution of ODTS in anhydrous toluene at room temperature overnight, then the substrates were rinsed with toluene, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and dried with a stream of nitrogen. The polymer semiconductors (e.g.PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT) were first dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (12 mg ml−1) at 100 °C for at least 5 h, and then the polymer solutions were filtered through 0.22 μm pore size PTFE membrane syringe filters. Afterward, thin film polymers were deposited on ODTS-modified SiO2/Si substrates by the spin-coating method at a spin rate of 800 rpm for 60 s. In addition, an annealing process (140 °C under nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h) was introduced to enhance the FET performance. The top-contact source/drain electrodes were defined by 100 nm-thick gold through a regular shadow mask, and the channel length (L) and width (W) were 50 and 1000 μm, respectively. Electrical characteristics of FET were recorded with a N2-filled glove box using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA).


All of the bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells were fabricated by the following procedure: the glass–indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (obtained from Lumtec (Taiwan), 5 Ω sq−1) were first patterned by lithography, then cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and subsequently dried by a hot plate at 120 °C for 5 min. Afterward, the substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI4083) was filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size PTFE membrane syringe filter and deposited on ITO by spin-coating at 3800–4000 rpm in air and then dried at 150 °C for 15 min under vacuum. The polymer/PCBM blend (with the polymer concentration of 12–15 mg ml−1) was prepared by dissolving the components in anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene or o-dichlorobenzene/DIO in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The active layer was then spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min in the glove box. Subsequently, the device was thermally evaporated using a Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm) electrode under high vacuum (<10−6 torr). The active area of the device was defined as 4 mm2 and was encapsulated with UV-curing glue. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the polymer photovoltaic cells were obtained by a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 (Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) source measurement unit (SMU) with a Peccell solar simulator under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The illumination intensity was calibrated by a standard Si photodiode detector with a KG-5 filter.


New selenophene-containing molecules with conjugated thiophene side chains, Se4T and 2Se4T, were successfully designed and synthesized. The synthetic route and synthesis details are listed in the ESI. The monomers are linked with different π-conjugating spacers, including vinylene (V), thiophene (T), bithiophene (2T), and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), thus creating five polymers with tunable optical and electrical properties. The chemical structures of the studied polymers and monomers are confirmed by 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. Fig. 1 shows the 1H-NMR spectrum of P2Se4TTT in CDCl3 solution. Signals between 6.6 and 7.2 ppm are assigned to the protons on the aromatic rings, which are assigned to the protons on the selenophene and thiophene rings of the polymer main chain, and the protons on the side chain thiophene rings. Moreover, the peaks at 2.75 ppm (thiophene–CH2, peak f) and 1.75–0.75 ppm (–CH2 and –CH3, peak g) are attributed to the dodecyl group in the 2Se4T unit. The numbers of aliphatic and aromatic protons are estimated from the integration value of peaks, which are consistent with the proposed polymer structures. The 1H-NMR spectra of other studied polymers also exhibited good agreement with the proposed polymer structures, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI). In addition, the elemental analyses of the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur contents illustrate good agreement with the theoretical content. This set of polymers have weight-averaged molecular weights in the range of 22–69 kDa with a polydispersity of 1.6–2.1 from GPC measurements, as summarized in Table 1. The relatively low molecular weights of PSe4TV, PSe4TT, and PSe4T2T are related to their solubility (Table S1 (ESI)), and the copolymers are only partially dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and chloroform. Thus, the GPC would only count the small molecular weight portions. All the synthesized polymers, generally, are soluble in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), providing the solution-processable thin films for transistors and photovoltaic applications.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to determine the thermal stability of our designed polymers, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The thermal decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT is 389, 395, 407, 405, and 410 °C, respectively, indicating that these polymers possess good thermal stability for optoelectronic device applications. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was also performed to explore the thermal transition of the studied polymer (Fig. S10 in ESI). For the Se4T- and 2Se4T-based polymers, however, no evident thermal transition in the bulk sample was observed for the heating temperature up to 250 °C, which is not uncommon in conjugated polymer systems.


The normalized UV-vis absorption of the studied polymers in dilute o-DCB solution and spin-coated thin films are depicted in Fig. S11 (ESI) and Fig. 2(b), respectively. The corresponding maximum absorption wavelength of the polymers in solution (λsolmax) or film state (λfilmmax) and optical band gaps (Eoptg) are summarized in Table 1. The absorption signal near 245 nm in solid state for all studied polymers was attributed to the π–π* transition of thiophene side chains, whereas the absorption peak in visible region belonged to the electronic transition of conjugated backbone. The visible absorption maximum of PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT in dilute o-DCB solution and film state (λsolmax, λfilmmax) is (500, 515), (496, 521), (497, 519), (507, 553), and (529, 577), respectively. A significant spectral red-shift (Δλ) of approximately 46 and 48 nm was observed for PSe4TTT and P2Se4TTT, respectively, from solution to solid state, indicating the strong interchain association and aggregation inside the polymer thin film. The larger red-shifting of PSe4TTT and P2Se4TTT in the film state indicates that the incorporated TT moiety can efficiently enhance the intermolecular stacking and electronic coupling between neighboring polymer backbones in the film state, compared to other studied materials (PSe4TV (Δλ = 15 nm), PSe4TT (Δλ = 25 nm), and PSe4T2T (Δλ = 22 nm)). In addition, P2Se4TTT thin film possesses an observed absorption shoulder (ca. 650 nm), indicating higher structural organization and ordered packing, which is effective for electronic device applications.

The optical band gap (Eoptg), estimated from the onset of thin film UV-vis absorption by employing the empirical equation (Eoptg = 1240 λonset−1, eV), for the studied polymers is in the following order: P2Se4TTT (1.78) < PSe4TTT (1.86) < PSe4TV (1.87) < PSe4T2T (1.91) < PSe4TT (1.92). The difference of Eoptg between these polymers is mainly attributed to the varied chemical structure of π-conjugated spacers. Among all synthesized polymers, the presence of large Eoptg for PSe4TT and PSe4T2T is probably due to the conformational distortions of the polymer backbone. Particularly for PSe4TT, the largest Eoptg is obtained because the hindrance between conjugated side chains cannot be reduced effectively using a single thiophene moiety as spacer. As vinylene (PSe4TV) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (PSe4TTT) spacers were incorporated into the polymer system, an antisymmetric chemical structure was induced, leading to stronger intermolecular interactions as well as lower energy gaps. Moreover, the smallest Eoptg is exhibited on P2Se4TTT. The insertion of a biselenophene group can further lower the conformation hindrance of thiophene side chains and increase the intermolecular interactions in thin films because the selenium atom has a larger atomic radius and is more polarizable than the sulfur atom. Note that the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacer in this new polymer system (PSe4TTT and P2Se4TTT) can efficiently enhance the planarity of polymer backbone and level down the energy band gaps, compared to P4TSe and P4T2Se polymers in our pervious study.

To understand the effect of different conjugated spacers on the energy levels within Se4T- and 2Se4T-based polymers, electrochemistry measurements of polymer films were performed (Fig. 2(c)). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the studied polymers using thin films were obtained in dry acetonitrile at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were estimated from onset oxidation potentials (Eoxonset), which are based on the equations HOMO = −[Eoxonset − Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8] eV, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were determined based on the difference between HOMO and the optical band gap. Note that the measured potentials are compared to a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The corresponding HOMO energy levels of PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT are −5.03, −5.07, −5.09, −5.02, and −4.90 eV, respectively, whereas their LUMO energy levels are similar, in the range from −3.12 to −3.18 eV. All calculation results are listed in Table 1. PSe4TT (−5.07 eV) and PSe4T2T (−5.09 eV) exhibited deeper HOMO levels than other studied polymers, which is mainly due to the conformational distortion of the polymer chains. The single thiophene spacer cannot diminish the hindrance between conjugated side chains and bithiophene may induce an additional torsion between two thiophene rings and reduce the conjugation length of polymer. This result is also related to the large energy band gap of these two polymers. Similarly, chemical structures with higher planarity of polymer main chain were obtained using vinylene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacers, leading to slightly higher HOMO levels for PSe4TV, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT. In addition, as compared to the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PSe4TTT (−5.02/−3.15 eV), P2Se4TTT (−4.90/−3.12 eV) exhibits a higher HOMO level and a lower LUMO level due to the stronger intermolecular interaction of biselenophene rings than single selenophene rings. This strong intermolecular interaction of P2Se4TTT would induce self-organization properties inside polymer thin film, which is effective for optoelectronic device applications.


The thin film morphologies of PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT were explored using atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) analyses. AFM topographies (Fig. S12 in ESI) exhibited that PSe4TV and PSe4TT possess large aggregates as well as high roughness on the film surfaces, whereas uniform and smooth surfaces (roughness < 1 nm) were observed for the other three polymers. The rough film morphology of PSe4TV and PSe4TT is mainly due to their relatively poor solubility and large conformational distortions of polymer side chain, as the small size of spacer may not reduce the hindrance of thiophene side chains. The thin films of PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT polymers were further investigated by TEM, as shown in Fig. 3. Nanofibrillar-like structures can be observed on PSe4TTT and P2Se4TTT films, indicating that the inserted fused thiophene spacer successfully enhances the planarity of the polymer backbone, which could induce the self-organized packing structure. Compared to those nanofibrillar structures, no significant morphology was explored on PSe4T2T surface.

Moreover, GIXD measurement (Fig. 4 and S14 (ESI)) was used to understand the molecular packing structures in thin films of these studied polymers. Among them, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT exhibited distinguishable diffraction signals in the qz direction and their primary diffraction (100) peaks are observed at 2.64°, 2.67°, and 2.91°, respectively, corresponding to the d-spacing of 28.6, 28.3, and 26.1 Å. Note that the d-spacing of these three polymers is slightly larger than that of the polymers in our previous studies (17–25 Å) due to the longer alkyl side chain (dodecyl group) on thiophene rings. The diffraction intensity of PSe4TTT and P2Se4TTT is markedly stronger than PSe4T2T, and the secondary diffraction (200) signals are found around 5.57° and 6.04°, respectively, which is consistent with the appearance of orderly nanofibrillar morphology in the TEM images. In addition, there are no significant signals on the GIXD pattern of PSe4TV (Fig. S14(a)) and PSe4TT (Fig. S14(b)), indicating the amorphous nature of these two polymers. P2Se4TTT possesses the smallest packing distance among these five studied polymers, resulting in a densest interdigitation of polymer backbones. From the AFM, TEM, and GIXD results, the ordering nanofibrillar crystalline packing structure of P2Se4TTT film with the interconnected networks of the polymer chains may provide the formation of highly efficient pathways for charge carrier transport.

The influences of different conjugated spacers in the polymeric semiconductors were investigated by FET techniques using o-DCB as processing solvent. The electrical characteristics of the studied polymers casted on the ODTS-modified SiO2/Si substrates are summarized in Table 2. These polymers exhibit typical p-type FET behaviors, and the saturation-regime mobility was calculated from the slope of the plot of drain/source current (Ids)−0.5 as a function of the gate voltage (Vg). The correlation between the Ids and other parameters is shown using the following equation:

Ids = 0.5WCiμL−1(Vg − Vt)2
(1)
where
Ids is the drain-to-source current in the saturated region, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, μ is the hole mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer (300 nm SiO2, Ci = 10 nF cm−2), and Vg and Vt are the gate and threshold voltages, respectively. Fig. 5(a) and S15 (ESI) show the p-type output characteristics of P2Se4TTT and other polymers, good current modulation and well-defined linear and saturation regions are observed. Furthermore, the transfer curves are depicted in Fig. 5(b). The higher drain current corresponds to higher charge carrier mobility. The average p-channel mobilities of PSe4TV-, PSe4TT-, PSe4T2T-, PSe4TTT-, and P2Se4TTT-based as-cast devices are 4.8 × 10−4, 8.1 × 10−5, 1.0 × 10−3, 5.4 × 10−3 and 5.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. As the FETs are annealed at 140 °C for 1 h under vacuum, the hole mobilities of PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT are increased to 3.2 × 10−3, 8.6 × 10−4, 1.0 × 10−2, 6.0 × 10−2 and 2.5 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Note that the on/off ratios are in a range of 103–105 for all devices. The annealing process successfully enhances the mobility of the studied materials by at least an order of magnitude, due to the improved polymer chain packing as well as charge transport ability during thermal treatment.

The transistor performance of the Se4T- and 2Se4T-based polymers is largely affected by the varied conjugated spacers. With only a single thiophene or double bond linkage as spacer, PSe4TT and PSe4TV exhibit low mobilities of 8.6 × 10−4 and 3.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This may be attributed to their amorphous structural nature and poor thin film quality on ODTS-modified substrate, because the spacers cannot reduce the steric hindrance of thiophene side chains. Hence, the polymer chains tend to form large aggregates on the surface (Fig. S12), and the grain boundaries could disturb the charge transporting. The polymer with an additional unsubstituted thiophene ring as a spacer, PSe4T2T, showed a higher mobility (0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1) than PSe4TT and PSe4TV after annealing because the bithiophene moiety provides more appropriate space to enhance the inter-digitations between polymer chains. Moreover, PSe4TTT possesses a stronger charge transport ability (0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1) than PSe4T2T because the fused-ring spacer (TT) can promote self-organization and minimize steric interactions, thus inducing crystalline packing structure and enhancing the charge transport, as evidenced from morphological analyses. The highest mobility among all studied polymers is observed with the P2Se4TTT-based device (0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1). The incorporated biselenophene moiety can efficiently assist in intermolecular π–π stacking due to the strong intermolecular interaction of the selenium atom. The dense molecular packing architecture as well as nanofibrillar polymer network are induced through the TT spacer, facilitating an unhindered charge transporting channel. In addition, the higher molecular weight of P2Se4TTT may also influence thin-film microstructure, crystallinity, or domain size, leading to the best charge transport characteristics.

The bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells were fabricated with a sandwich configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PCBM/Ca (30 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layers of the studied polymers were prepared through optimal annealing temperature at 140 °C for 10 min. The J–V curves of polymer/PC61BM blends were measured in air after encapsulation with UV-curing glue, as shown in Fig. S16 in ESI. The detailed PV properties, including short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer/PC61BM blends, are summarized in Table S2 (ESI). The highest PCEs of PSe4TV, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT are 0.43, 0.42, 0.61, and 1.18%, respectively, which are based on the same polymer/PC61BM blend ratio. The PV cell based on PSe4TT could not detect typical J–V characteristics due to its poor film quality and charge transport ability. P2Se4TTT achieves the highest PCE among this set of polymers owing to the high Jsc value, which is supported by its highest p-type mobility and broadest absorption as well as smallest band gap. Moreover, the Jsc of P2Se4TTT can be further enhanced (from 4.19 to 6.53 mA cm−2) using PC71BM as an acceptor (Fig. 6) because this stronger acceptor (PC71BM) can increase the photocurrent as well as the absorption coefficient in the visible region, compared to PC61BM. The optimal efficiency of 1.76% is obtained at a 1:2 (w/w) blend ratio of P2Se4TTT/PC71BM (Table 3).

It has been reported that adding additives (e.g. 1,8-diiodooctane) into polymer/fullerene blends can successfully tune the bulk heterojunction morphology of solar cells, leading to better exciton dissociation efficiency and transport of the separated charge carriers to the respective electrode. Hence, P2Se4TTT-based PV cells are further investigated using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as additives with o-DCB for preparing active layers. The J–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 6 and summarized in Table 3. Different amounts of DIO (1%–4% by weight) were investigated in a P2Se4TTT/PC71BM (1:2 w/w) system, and the optimized PCE of 2.29% could be obtained as 2 wt% of DIO was added. The presence of DIO significantly improved the Jsc and Voc value of PVs from 6.53 to 6.79 mA cm−2 and 0.58 to 0.74 V, respectively, compared to that of P2Se4TTT/PC71BM PV cells without DIO. The enhancements of those PV factors should be mainly judged by the morphology of the P2Se4TTT/PC71BM blend (Fig. S17 in ESI). The size of PC71BM aggregations are clearly reduced as DIO is introduced, leading to better thin film uniformity as well as higher PCE.

In conclusion, five new Se4T- and 2Se4T-based polymers (PSe4TV, PSe4TT, PSe4T2T, PSe4TTT, and P2Se4TTT) were successfully designed and synthesized using palladium(0)-catalyzed Stille polymerization. The optical and electrochemical properties of this set of polymers were highly dependent on their chemical structures, which incorporated different π-conjugated spacers. The smallest band gap (1.78 eV) could be observed for P2Se4TTT among the studied polymers due to the insertion of biselenophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moieties, which can further lower the conformation hindrance of thiophene side chains and increase main chain coplanarity as well as the intermolecular interactions in thin films. The field-effect mobilities of these polymers could be as high as 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a large on/off ratio above 105 (P2Se4TTT). This high mobility result was attributed to the dense molecular packing structure and nanofibrillar morphology of P2Se4TTT thin film, as demonstrated by AFM, TEM, and GIXD. The solar cell efficiencies of the polymer/PC61BM blends were in the range of 0.43%–1.18% under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). In particular, P2Se4TTT showed the highest PCE of 2.29% (Jsc = 6.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.74 V, and FF = 0.455) using the additive (2% DIO), which was mainly due to its high p-type mobility, broad absorption (small band gap), and uniform polymer/PC71BM blending morphology. The abovementioned results indicated that the design of polymer with selenophene-containing main chain with conjugated thiophene side chain and connected with various π-conjugated spacers could successfully tune the optoelectronic characteristics, leading to the potential use in future polymer device applications.
