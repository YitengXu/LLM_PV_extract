Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated based on rutile TiO2 microspheres that are synthesized by a hydrothermal route. We found that, with increasing deposition time, semi microspheres get converted into microspheres. Our results show that the TiO2-based cells exhibit a noticeable improvement in the overall efficiency: maximum 3.81% versus 0.67% for the reference cell made of a rutile TiO2 semispherical nanocrystalline film. This extraordinary result is attributed to the effective light trapping and dye loading resulting in the highest efficiency 3.81%.

Titania (TiO2) has been intensively investigated as an efficient photocatalyst for various applications, such as water splitting, environmental photo catalysis, and photo electrochemical devices. Titanium oxide (TiO2) is one of the most important functional semiconducting materials found in three different crystalline phases: anatase, rutile and brookite. In recent years hierarchical nanostructures have captured much attention in dye-sensitized solar cells, photocatalysts and gas sensors due to their unusual properties. Also, varying the particle shape can affect the particle packing density, which, in turn, can alter harvesting and electron transport in TiO2 films. The hydrothermal process has become popular due to its simple process, fast reaction velocity and low cost, which might pave the way for novel TiO2 morphologies with new properties. Recently, Y. J. Kim et al., Jun Song Chen et al. and J. Luo et al. have synthesized nanoporous TiO2 spheres by a hydrothermal process. Such spherical TiO2 samples provided a novel hierarchical pore structure with high surface area and large pore diameter resulting in fairly good scattering effect.

Many researchers have adopted low temperature synthesis methodology such as hydrothermal and supercritical drying methods for the preparation of rutile TiO2 nanoparticles. Recently several morphologies of rutile TiO2 have been developed including single-crystal nanowires, nanotubes, nanospheres, nanorods, nanoribbons, nanosheets and nanocubes, hollow spheres and nanocoral. Several other methods have been employed to fabricate nanostructured TiO2, which often involve a wet chemical process at low temperature, including sol–gel templates, surfactant templating and ionic liquid based synthesis of TiO2 nanoflowers based on hydrothermal methods. Herein, the hydrothermal route for the growth and assembly of microspheres of rutile TiO2 has been demonstrated. The maximum power conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs reaches 3.81% under 1 sun illumination using micro-spherical morphology.

TiO2 films containing hierarchical microspheres were prepared by the hydrothermal method. The detailed procedure is available in our previous report. In a typical experiment, titanium(IV) butoxide (0.5 mL) was added to toluene (7.5 mL), followed by the addition of conc. HCl (12 M, 7.5 mL, 35.4% AR). The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min. The solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, to which fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate was immersed in the solution. The autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven at 160 °C for 4h and the sample was designated as TMS-4. Using the same procedure, samples were deposited for 6 h and 8 h deposition time and designated as TMS-6 and TMS-8, respectively. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the TiO2 films were washed several times with distilled water and dried in oven at 70 °C for 1 h.


The structural properties of the deposited TiO2 films were studied from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips, PW 3710, Almelo, Holland) operated at 25 kV, 20 mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The Raman spectra of the films were recorded in the spectral range of 35–1200 cm−1 using Raman spectrometer (Bruker MultiRAM, Germany Make) using Nd:YAG laser source with excitation wavelength of 1064 nm and resolution 4 cm−1 at 50 mW laser power. The surface morphological and lattice structural information were examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Model JEOL JSM-6360, Japan). An X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) was studied by using XPS, VG Multilab 2000, Thermo VG Scientific, UK.


Dye-sensitized solar cells were assembled as follows: the microspherical TMS-4, TMS-6 and TMS-8 thin film samples were immersed in a mild piranha solution (1 part Millipore water, 3 parts sulfuric acid, and 2 parts hydrogen peroxide) for 30 min at 50 °C, rinsed in Millipore water and ethanol and dried in an oven at 60 °C. The TiO2 films were subsequently soaked in ethanolic 0.3 mM N3 dye solution at room temperature for 24 h and then washed carefully in ethanol. The dyed film was rinsed in acetonitrile and dried in air. A compact and sealed dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was fabricated using a standard two-electrode configuration, comprising dye loaded Glass/FTO/TMS (with an active surface area of 0.5 cm2) as the photoanode and platinum coated FTO as the counter electrode, which is sealed with the working electrode using a spacer (∼1 mm) of polyacrylamide. The Pt/FTO counter electrode was prepared by dropping an H2PtCl6 solution (0.7 mM) on a pre-cleaned FTO coated glass substrate followed by heating at 400 °C for 20 min in air. The iodide-based electrolyte, consisting of 0.1 M lithium iodide and 0.05 M iodine in acetonitrile was used as the redox electrolyte and injected into the interelectrode space from the counter electrode side through a pre-drilled hole.

For comparison, we used P25 Degussa TiO2 nanoparticles and ∼4.2 μm thick film was fabricated by using the well known doctor blade technique. Briefly, 1 g of TiO2 nanoparticles paste was prepared using Ethyl cellulose, Lauric Acid and Terpenol in Ethanolic solution and a film was deposited on the FTO coated glass substrate and annealed at 450 °C for 5 min. The deposited film was loaded with 0.3 mM N3-Dye molecules by dipping the substrate for 24 h in ethanolic solution. A compact and sealed dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was fabricated using a standard two-electrode configuration, comprising dye loaded Glass/FTO/P25 (with an active surface area of 0.5 cm2) as the photoanode and platinum coated FTO as the counter electrode, which is sealed with the working electrode using a spacer (∼1 mm) of polyacrylamide. The iodide-based electrolyte, consisting of 0.1 M lithium iodide and 0.05 M iodine in acetonitrile was used as the redox electrolyte and injected into the interelectrode space from the counter electrode side through a pre-drilled hole. The DSSCs properties were measured by Sol2A Oriel New Port Corporation USA, with Keithley-2420 source meter under 1.5 AM illumination. To measure the adsorbed dye concentration on the TiO2 electrode surface, the dye loaded TiO2 samples were desorbed by a 0.1 M NaOH solution in water and ethanol (50:50, v:v) for 10 min. The dimension of the TiO2 electrode was 1 cm2. The adsorbed dye was quantitatively determined from the absorbance at 510 nm measured by UV-1800, Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer (Resolution 0.01 nm).
Impedance spectra for the electrochemical cells consisting of P25 and TMS samples as working electrodes were recorded from 1 mHz to 1 MHz with 10 mV AC using parstat 273 system. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature, in air.


Fig. 1(a)–(c) show the SEM images of TiO2 samples at different reaction times. The SEM micrograph in Fig. 1(a) consists of large quantities of semi-spheres at 4 h of reaction time. The diameter of the semi-spherical regions is in the range of 2–3.5 μm.

Deposition time influences the transformation of the initially grown semi-spheres to the perfect spheres having 3 μm diameter as shown in Fig. 1 for TMS-6 sample with 6 h of reaction time. Such newly grown nanospheres have large surface to volume ratios, which make them unstable due to the high surface energy and large surface curvature. Therefore, a spontaneous aggregation step of TiO2 primary nanoparticles occurs, subsequently to form the spherical secondary aggregated particles by elimination of the surfaces with higher energy and reducing the total interfacial energy. It is noted that all the constituent nanospheres have a uniform shape with a diameter of 120 nm. Fig. 1(c) shows the micrograph of the TMS-8 sample obtained after reaction for 8 h at 160 °C, which consists of spherical architectures with diameters of about 5 μm.
The crystallinity and phase confirmation of deposited TMS samples were done by XRD and FT-Raman spectroscopy measurements. Seven distinct reflections such as (101), (211), (220), (002), (310), (301) and (112), besides a prominent (110) reflection, are seen in the all TMS-4, TMS-6 and TMS-8 samples, which shows the rutile phase of TiO2. The XRD spectra of TMS-4, TMS-6 and TMS-8 samples are available in Fig. S1, ESI. Four Raman active modes with symmetries of A1g, B1g, B2g and Eg have been found and were detected in the rutile TiO2 at 143 (B1g), 447 (Eg), 612 (A1g), and 826 (B2g) cm−1 expressed as Rutile = A1g + B1g + B2g + Eg. Among these, the two prominent maxima, at 445 (Eg) and 609 cm−1 (A1g), are comparable with that found in the rutile phase of the TiO2 (please see Fig. S2, ESI, for FT-Raman spectra of TMS and P25 sample). For comparison we have added the Raman spectrum of the P25 sample.

Fig. 2(a)–(b) shows the corresponding X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) result, indicating that the microspheres mainly consist of Ti and O with an approximate atomic ratio of 1:1.72, which is consistent with the stoichiometry of TiO2. This indicates that the material was in a fully oxidised state of Ti4+ (O–Ti–O). The spectrum of the TMS has a Ti2p binding energy of 458.70 eV, which is in excellent agreement with the values reported for TiO2 in the NIST database. The same sample also exhibited an O1s peak at 529.8 eV, characteristic of the oxide. The O1s main peak at 532.17 eV is assigned to the metallic oxides (Ti–O), which is consistent with the binding energy of O2− in the TiO2 lattices.
An additional O1s peak is observed as a higher binding energy shoulder, with a binding energy of 531.0 eV, suggesting the presence of surface hydroxyl groups. A shoulder to the main O1s peak can be observed at high binding energy, which can be attributed to the hydroxyl groups (–OH) or chemisorbed water molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The main peak at 529.8 eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen ions, and the minor one at 531.6 eV should be the contribution of surface states due to oxygen vacancy. The ratio of Ti:O (530.3 eV) was found to be 1:1.72; thus, the XPS data together with the XRD data, strongly suggest that the microspheres of the TiO2 material synthesized using the hydrothermal synthesis system is nearly stoichiometric rutile.
On the basis of the above observations, a plausible growth mechanism is proposed to illustrate the growth of hierarchical TiO2 microspheres (as shown in Scheme 1) during the hydrothermal process. Here, we used toluene and hydrochloric acid as the non-polar solvent and polar solvent, respectively. When we increase the system temperature of such non-polar and polar solvent, a small amount of polar water from the HCl solution start to diffuse from the high-energy water/toluene interface aggregating on the hydrophilic glass/water forming nucleation centers. Simultaneously, Ti4+ precursors will hydrolyze with water at the water/glass interface resulting in the formation of the first nanocrystalline layer as shown in Scheme 1(A). Thus, a new interface between the hydrophilic TiO2 and toluene is formed. With continuous hydrolysis and subsequent growth, crystallization takes place to form nanospheres as shown in Scheme 1(B). Then, a local rutile-type nucleus could be spontaneously produced, which is the most probable phase in the presence of polar and nonpolar solvents in a strong acidic medium, to form a nucleation region as shown in Scheme 1(B). This region is homogeneous and isotropic because of the absence of surfactants or templates as in other systems. These nanospherical particles are aggregated together under the pressure and temperature of the system to form hierarchical microspheres as shown in Scheme 1(C and D).

Fig. 3(a) shows the J–V characteristics of a typical P25 degussa powder based device and TiO2 microspheres under illumination. The DSSC devices assembled using the above films were tested under simulated AM 1.5 G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). The photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. The P25 based device shows 5.1 mA cm−2 short circuit current and 0.7 V open circuit voltage with a power conversion efficiency of 1.74% and 0.40 fill factor. The DSSC based on TMS-4 produced a conversion effiency (η) of 0.64% (Jsc = 4.35 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.558 V, FF = 0.40). The TMS-6 sample shows conversion efficiency (η) of 1.66% (Jsc = 5.25 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.685 V, FF = 0.46). In the case of TMS-8, the J–V characteristics show Jsc = 7.85 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.713 V, FF = 0.68. The conversion efficiency of TMS-8 is estimated as 3.81%, which could be due to effective dye loading of the micro-spherical morphology (Fig. 3(b)). In order to verify this, the adsorbed amounts of dye were determined by measuring the eluted dye concentration from the porous TiO2 structure with UV-vis (UV-1800, Shimadzu) absorption spectroscopy. The P25 sample shows 88.1 μmol cm−2, which is less as compared to the TMS-4, TMS-6 and TMS-8 samples. The amount of dye loaded by the TMS-8 sample is higher (123.9 μmol cm−2) compared to both TMS-4 (99.5 μmol cm−2) and TMS-6 (111.3 μmol cm−2) samples. From the above discussion it is clear that the increment in dye absorption is simply proportional to the surface area of the TiO2 microspheres.

The nano-spherical TiO2 structures synthesized in this work possess a notably high surface area, which is essential to load large amounts of dye molecules and to produce high currents. The unique hierarchical structure will also induce efficient electrolyte diffusion. The large microspheres provide propagation and multiple scattering of light in a porous electrode consisting of nano and/or micro sized spherical aggregates, as seen in the SEM micrographs.
In order to understand the carrier transport effects at the various interfaces, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on the assembled cells under sunlight type radiation (Wipro, 1.3 mW cm−2) at −0.70 V applied potential was performed. Analyzing the EIS results using the appropriate impedance model gives insights into the interfacial charge transfer processes that take place at the working and counter electrodes/electrolyte interfaces.
Typical EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2 DSSCs devices (P25, TMS-4, TMS-6 and TMS-8) are shown in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 4(b) shows the equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance data for P25, (c) for TMS-4, (d) for TMS-6 and TMS-8 samples.
Since the impedance spectra was recorded at −0.7 V (near flat band condition for FTO/TiO2) and in the presence of sunlight type radiation, the FTO/TiO2 interface contribution towards impedance spectra is negligible. The impedance spectra of the P25 based DSSC clearly indicates two semicircles, one in low to medium frequency and another at high frequency, which is fitted with an equivalent circuit as in Fig. 4(b). In Fig. 4(b), Ri and Qi represent the nonporous P25/Dye interfacial resistance and capacitance where as R2 and Q2 represents that of the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the equivalent circuit for TMS-4 (Fig. 4(c)), R3 represents the electrode/electrolyte interface, R1 is the shunt resistance in parallel with the TMS-4 (well connected grains of semispherical shape)-Dye structure represented by W1, R2, C1. R3 is the charge transfer resistance and it appears that there is no significant double layer capacitance. While W1 and R2 represent the diffusion resistance and series resistance of the TMS-4/Dye structure, C1 represents the TMS-4/Dye junction capacitance. In the case of TMS-6 and 8, structures with large pores, the equivalent circuit model for fitting the impedance data changes to Fig. 4(d), wherein the grain boundary charge diffusion component in the TMS-4 is replaced by the constant phase element Q. The SEM micrographs shown in Fig. 1 indicate that TMS-6 and TMS-8 have highly porous structures and, hence, an inhomogeneous charge distribution on the surface leading to constant phase element contribution. Such porous structures, with nano-spheres among the micro-spheres, can effectively increase the light harvesting within the electrode and thus enhance the photon-capture probability. Also, it works as a ‘pathway’ for dye diffusion throughout a thick TiO2 layer increasing the electron transport probability to the FTO.
However, impedance spectra in Fig. 4(a) indicate that TMS-6 has relatively larger impedance contribution compared to TMS-8 even though the surface area of TMS-6 appears to be higher. This observation supports the lower fill factor and current density (Fig. 3) observed, resulting in the lower efficiency estimated for TMS-6 DSSC. The larger impedance can be attributed to the following facts: a large number of surface states, due to the highly porous structure, provide recombination centres and a non-uniform FTO/TiO2 interface, which retards the electron transfer.

The preparation procedures for TiO2 nanospheres are simple, reproducible, and easy to scale up with low cost as seen in the systematic variations of the diameter of microspheres. The microspheres grown from the toluene system are superior to those grown from the toluene and acid system in solar cell performance, typically in Jsc. Even with a 2.3 μm diameter microsphere film, a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of 3.81% has been achieved, which is more efficient than a DSSC based on a nanoparticulate film. Development of bigger TiO2 microspheres incubated for longer times for high efficiency is under way. These findings provide scope for preparing uniform spherical hierarchical structures of TiO2 in toluene solvent for efficient dye sensitized solar cells onto FTO coated glass substrate.
