In perovskite solar cells, I− tends to oxidize to I2 due to its low redox potential. The generated I2 has been proved to be detrimental to device performance. Herein, for the first time, an amidine DBU is introduced as an additive into the precursor of the perovskite layer. The reductive DBU can suppress the formation of iodine impurity, resulting in a highly pure perovskite polycrystalline film. The efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are thus improved.

The development of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells has progressed rapidly in the past few years. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells has increased from initial 3.8% in 2009 to over 22% in 2017, achieving an unprecedented rise in photovoltaics. In addition to the high PCEs, the perovskite solar cells can be processed at low temperatures from solutions, due to which they are potentially more cost-effective than the well-established silicon solar-cell technology. In spite of the high efficiency and easy processing, the main challenges of perovskite solar cells are reproducibility and reliability. The efficiency of these cells depends on the fabrication atmosphere as well as the impurities or chemical compositions of the precursor solutions.

Numerous efforts have been made to understand the factors that affect the reproducibility and reliability of the perovskite solar cells. An unambiguous phenomenon of a color change from dark brown to yellow can be observed and indicates the degradation of the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite films. Besides the factors such as humidity, light illumination, oxygen and thermal stress, iodine (I2), which is one of the main products of perovskite film degradation, is generally neglected. It has been reported that the color and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films change when I2 solution is dropped onto the MAPbI3 perovskite films. Qi and co-workers intentionally exposed perovskite films to I2 vapor to investigate its detrimental effects. They concluded that I2 is a universal degradation factor for iodide-based perovskites. Moreover, they also found that the I2 species can migrate from the perovskite layer to react with the top Ag electrode. Furthermore, I− can readily be oxidized into I2 when exposed to air and light. Considering the detrimental effect caused by I2, it is important to eliminate the iodine impurities in the precursor solutions and avoid I2 formation in the devices. Snaith and co-workers introduced hypophosphorous acid (HPA), a strong reducing agent, into the precursor solution to chemically reduce the oxidized I2 back to I−. Zhou and co-workers reported an efficient method via introducing a methylamine solution-based additive into the precursor solution. Methylamine was employed to eliminate I2, and this yielded a polycrystalline film with minimized intrinsic defect, which therefore resulted in high-performance planar perovskite solar cells. Chen and co-workers also employed the methylamine alcohol solution to purify the crude CH3NH3I (MAI) powder, which resulted in a substantial decrease of I2 in the final MAI precursor. Trap density in the resultant perovskite films was decreased, and the device performance was improved.
Herein, we first introduce an amidine 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as a reducing additive in the MAPbI3 precursor solutions. DBU is an organic amidine compound with strong basicity. We have previously reported that DBU can serve as an efficient n-dopant due to its strong electron-donating property. Herein, we find that the DBU additive can suppress the process of I− oxidation to form I2 impurities. The decomposition of MAI is thus alleviated. Reaction of MAI and PbI2 for obtaining methylammonium lead iodide is promoted and results in a high quality polycrystalline film with less defects, enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and longer PL lifetime.
To verify that the DBU additive can suppress the formation of I2 impurities from MAI or PbI2 during device processing, we add 10 μl DBU into the perovskite precursor solution in which 1 mg I2 is intentionally added. As shown in Fig. 1a, the reference precursor solution with 1.3 M CH3NH3I/PbI2 (1:1) in 1,4-butyrolactone: dimethyl sulfoxide (GBL:DMSO = 7:3) (solution A) delivers a light yellow color. The color turns dark brown on the addition of 1 mg I2 (solution B). Then, after introducing 10 μl DBU into solution B, the color of the solution turns yellow again (solution C), which indicates the elimination of the remnant I2 from the precursors. The reaction between I2 and DBU follows the eqn (S1) given in the (ESI). To investigate the suppression effects of the DBU additive on I2 formation, UV-vis measurements of the above-mentioned solutions in GBL/DMSO solvents are conducted. As shown in Fig. 1b, we attribute the peak at 368 nm in the spectrum to I2 absorption in solution B. The absorbance at 368 nm is dramatically decreased after introducing DBU (solution C), which indicates the elimination of I2. In the devices, the origin of I2 can be mainly attributed to the hygroscopic MAI, which is very sensitive to air and light irradiation and thus cannot be stored for a long time. We trace the evolution of the I2 impurities in MAI solution after adding different ratios of DBU. The I2 characteristic peak exists in the newly prepared MAI solution. The intensity of the characteristic peak decreases with an increase in DBU additive, and the peak completely disappears when the amount of DBU reaches 50 μl ml−1 (Fig. S1, ESI).
The composition of a precursor solution plays a very critical role in the final morphology of a perovskite film. We performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the influence of DBU additive on the surface morphology of perovskite films. The perovskite films were processed from a precursor solution with a concentration of 1.3 M PbI2/MAI (1:1) in GBL:DMSO (7:3) solvents, as described in our previous study. DBU was added into the solution with various mass ratios to the solution. Fig. 2 shows the top-view SEM images of perovskite films prepared from precursor solutions without and with different ratios of DBU additive. As for the sample without the DBU additive, a few cracks as well as visible residual PbI2 could be observed on the surface of the film. These defects impede charge transport and induce recombination, thus leading to poor photovoltaic performance. The PbI2 residue could be from the degradation of MAI, which led to an unbalanced stoichiometric ratio of PbI2 and MAI. After introducing 1% DBU as an additive, the film became denser without cracks and PbI2 residue. It can be speculated that the reductive DBU suppressed the I− oxidation into I2 in precursor solutions and during the perovskite processing, consequently avoiding the loss of I−. Hence, a highly pure phase of MAPbI3 perovskite film was obtained. When the ratio of DBU was further increased to 5%, pin holes appeared in the films, which was detrimental to the device performance. The appearance of pin holes on the films can be attributed to excess DBU that can interact with PbI2 to form an adduct, which influences the crystallization kinetics. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S2, ESI) show that the distinct peak (001) at 12.6° of PbI2 powder disappeared after PbI2 powder was exposed to DBU vapor, whereas the diffraction peaks of MAI were unchanged after exposed to DBU vapor. This confirmed the coordinated interaction between DBU and PbI2. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained to further verify this coordination effect. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI), the feature band at 1590 cm−1 could be assigned to the vibration of CN group in DBU molecule. The shift of the stretching vibration of CN group in PbI2 sample to a lower wavenumber was indicative of the formation of an adduct.

Fig. 3a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the perovskite films processed from precursors having different weight ratios of DBU. The band gap (Eg) remains unchanged with the DBU incorporation. Only slight change in the absorption intensity in the short wavelength is observed. The results indicate that the DBU additive does not enter the perovskite lattice because a mild change in the perovskite lattice can cause a band gap shift of the material. In addition, the identical Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S4, ESI) of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3-DBU also confirm this point. Moreover, we do not discern any DBU residues, which presumably volatilized during the annealing process in the perovskite films. Fig. 3b shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films prepared without and with DBU additives. All the films show similar XRD patterns with distinctive diffraction peaks (110) at 2θ = 14.2° and (220) at 2θ = 28.5°, indicating tetragonal crystal structure of MAPbI3. An important observation is that the PbI2 impurity characteristic (denoted *) is present in the control film but disappears in the films processed from precursors with a DBU additive. A plausible explanation is that the DBU additive not only serves as an effective reducing agent to suppress iodine formation, but also promotes a sufficient reaction of MAI and PbI2 to form methylammonium lead iodide.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were further carried out to evaluate the quality of the perovskite films. All the samples were deposited on quartz substrates. As shown in Fig. 3c, a strong PL peak (770 nm) was observed for all samples, which was consistent with the results of UV-visible absorbance spectra and XRD measurements, indicating that the perovskite phase essentially is the same in the different samples. It is worth to note that the samples prepared from the precursor solution containing DBU additive exhibited increased PL intensity when compared with pure MAPbI3, implying a higher quality perovskite film. The time-resolved PL spectra of corresponding perovskite films are shown in Fig. 3d. To quantitatively analyze the carrier lifetime, a bi-exponential decay model was used to fit the PL decay curves, yielding a fast decay trace (τ1) and slow decay trace (τ2). In general, a fast decay τ1 usually relates to the surface recombination, whereas a slow decay τ2 can be ascribed to the bulk carrier recombination. From the fitted data summarized in Table S1 (ESI), we can see that the perovskite film prepared with 3% DBU additive exhibited a prolonged lifetime of τ2 = 105.23 ns compared to the reference sample without DBU (τ2 = 45.18 ns). The prolonged carrier lifetime further confirmed the high quality and less impurity in the perovskite films.
Perovskite solar cells with a planar structure (Glass/ITO/NiOx/Perovskite/PCBM/PEI/Ag (Fig. 4a)) were fabricated to evaluate the effect of DBU additives. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the perovskite solar cells without and with DBU additives are shown in Fig S5 (ESI). Device parameters are summarized in Table 1. It could be seen that the cells delivered improved performance when a small amount of DBU was added into the precursor solutions. Without DBU additive, the device exhibited modest performance with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.34 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.72 and PCE of 15.98%. After introducing 3% DBU additive, the device exhibited an excellent performance with Jsc of 22.38 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.08 V, FF of 0.75 and PCE of 18.13%. After applying a bias at the maximum output voltage, a stable power output was obtained (Fig. 4c). Jsc from the J–V measurement coincided with the integrated Jsc from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). Moreover, the performance of the cells was comparable when scanned in the reverse and forward directions (Fig. 4b). The improved device performance was mainly due to improved Jsc and Voc, which could be attributed to the high quality of the perovskite layer. In addition, we also observed the efficiency decay of the optimized perovskite solar cells without and with DBU additive. Both the perovskite solar cells were stored in an N2-filled glove box (O2: 20 ppm) without encapsulation. The efficiency of the device without additive decreased by 50% after 10 days, whereas the efficiency of the device having DBU additive was more than 80% of its initial PCE (Fig. 4d). A trace amount of I2 has been reported to induce the decomposition of perovskite, which decreases the efficiency of the cells. After introducing the reductive DBU additive, the process of I− oxidation to form I2 impurities was suppressed and therefore, the device stability was enhanced. In addition, high-purity perovskite polycrystalline films with less defects were obtained from DBU-containing precursors, which reduced the probability of undesirable water and oxygen penetration, and this was beneficial to the device stability.

In summary, we have demonstrated amidine (DBU) as the additive for the precursor solutions of perovskite films for solar cell applications. The reductive DBU additive suppresses the I− oxidation into I2 in the precursor solutions and during the perovskite processing. This effect protects MAI from decomposition into I2, which is beneficial to the device efficiency as well as reliability. Furthermore, the DBU additive also promotes a reaction of MAI and PbI2 to obtain perovskite and thus results in a high quality polycrystalline film with less defects. An excellent PCE of 18.13% is achieved for the planar perovskite solar cells fabricated with 3% DBU additive, which is higher than that of the reference devices based on films without additive showing a PCE of 15.98%.
