Two new copolymers (PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT) of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and thiazole (Tz) with different conjugated side groups 4,7-dithien-5-yl-2,1,3-benzodiathiazole (DTBT) and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTffBT) were synthesized via the Stille coupling polymerization and developed for polymer solar cell applications. The thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated. The two copolymers exhibited relatively low HOMO energy levels of −5.58 eV for PT-Tz-DTBT and −5.59 eV for PT-Tz-DTffBT, respectively. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with two as-synthesized copolymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron acceptor exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 2.63% and 3.75% for PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT, respectively. When PC71BM was used as an electron acceptor, a promising PCE of 3.65% and 4.42% for PT-Tz-DTffBT was achieved by using a conventional and inverted device structure, respectively.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their fascinating potential for low-cost, large-area production through solution processing. Recently, a lot of new donor–acceptor (D–A) low band gap polymers have been reported for high-performance PSCs. For example, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective building-blocks for developing high performance PSC polymers. The BHJ PSCs based on BDT copolymers have achieved a series of high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values in the range of 3–8%. To achieve high efficiency of PSCs, it is well recognized that p-type conjugated polymers should meet the following requirements simultaneously: (1) good solubility to guarantee solution processability and good miscibility with an electron acceptor material, (2) deep-lying HOMO energy level for generating high open-circuit voltage (Voc), (3) low band gap for broadening absorption spectrum to capture more solar photons, and (4) high hole mobility for effective charge transport ability.

For conventional conjugated polymers, it is hard to match well with all the demands mentioned above. Generally, to obtain a high Voc, one of the most effective approaches is to lower the HOMO energy level of polymer, while too low HOMO value would lead to a wide band gap of the polymer, and in turn reduce the short-circuit current density. To achieve high efficiencies of PSCs, researchers have developed a new family of polymers with conjugated side groups or side chains, which can increase the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density at the same time. In our previous research, we designed and synthesized a series of copolymers which contained a BDT group and a thiophene group in the main chain, and DTBT derivatives as the side chains. Most of those copolymers exhibit high short-circuit current density and PCE. However, to further improve the photovoltaic performance of these side-chain polymers, there are still many efforts to be made.
The thiazole (Tz) unit was reported to be used for lowering the HOMO energy levels of the BHJ PSCs. Additionally, the incorporation of fluorine substituents into the conjugated backbone can noticeably improve all three key device parameters (Voc, Jsc, and FF) of polymer-based BHJ solar cells. Furthermore, adding the fluorine atoms helps improve the morphology and structure of the BHJ film. And the higher purity, caused by the observed lower miscibility with PCBM when the fluorine concentration is increased, likely reduces bimolecular recombination, leading to an improved device function.
Here, we report two new conjugated copolymers (PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT) (Fig. 1), which used the thiazole unit to replace the thiophene unit, expecting to get deeper HOMO energy levels and higher open-circuit voltage. Moreover, two fluorine atoms were introduced at the 5 and 6 positions of the BT unit to get higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and higher FF value. The thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the two copolymers were investigated in detail.

3-Hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (5), tributyl(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)stannane (6), 5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (7), and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyl-oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (M3) were synthesized according to already published procedures. All the chemical materials were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Shanghai Medical Company (China). THF and toluene were refluxed over sodium and benzophenone, and distilled prior to use. DMF was dried and distilled under reduced pressure. All other commercially available materials were used as received unless noted otherwise. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (merck, 200–300 mesh). All other solvents and chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and used without further purification.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Spectra One spectrometer. Molecular mass was determined by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Bruker Aupoflex-III mass spectrometer. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the copolymers were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 spectrometer. The elemental analyses of all monomers were performed on an Elementar Vario EL III element analyzer for C, H and S determination. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 using a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer. Differential scanning calorimetric measurement (DSC) was performed on a TA DSCQ10 instrument at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The average molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were determined using Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three-electrode configuration and an electrochemistry workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM). CV was conducted on an electrochemistry workstation with the polymer thin film on a Pt plate as the working electrode, Pt slice as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in a 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out on a Digital Instruments EnviroScope instrument operated in a tapping mode.


The photovoltaic cells were constructed in a conventional sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/copolymer:PCBM (∼100 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, from Bayer AG) was spin-coated from an aqueous solution onto a cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate giving a thickness of about 30 nm, then dried at 150 °C for 30 min. The photosensitive blend layer of copolymers and PCBM was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution (the polymer concentration is 12 mg mL−1) onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode, and dried at 80 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The cathode of the device, consisting of 0.5 nm of LiF and 100 nm of aluminum, was thermally deposited on the top of the copolymer film at 5 × 105 Pa. The whole thicknesses of the PSCs were measured by an Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer. The active area of the device is 3.8 mm2. For the inverted device with the structure of ITO/TIPD (12 nm)/PT-Tz-DTffBT:PC71BM (∼100 nm) (1:2, w/w)/MoO3 (24 nm)/Al (100 nm), titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD) was used as the buffer layer material. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured by a computer controlled Keithley 236 source measurement moiety in the dark and under AM 1.5 illumination conditions, 100 mW cm−2. The measurement of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed using a Zolix DCS300PA Data acquisition system. All these measurements were performed under ambient atmosphere at room temperature.

To a 50 mL three-neck round bottom flask, M1 (0.15 g, 0.20 mmol), M3 (0.16 g, 0.20 mmol) and 15 mL of anhydrous toluene were added. The mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 15 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (25 mg, 21.6 mmol) was added under nitrogen atmosphere. Then the reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 3 days under nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was slowly poured into methanol (150 mL).

To a 50 mL three-neck round bottom flask, M2 (0.11 g, 0.15 mmol), M3 (0.11 g, 0.15 mmol) and 15 mL of anhydrous toluene were added. The mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 15 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (25 mg, 21.6 mmol) was added under nitrogen atmosphere. Then the reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 3 days under nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was slowly poured into methanol (150 mL). The precipitate was collected by filtration and then purified by washing with methanol, hexane and chloroform in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h in sequence. The red copolymer was recovered from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation. Yield: (0.105 g, 69.1%). FT-IR (KBr, cm−1): 948 (trans-vinylene). 8.49–6.78 (br, 7H), 4.27 (br, 2H), 2.88–2.54 (br, 4H), 2.15–1.13 (br, 36H), 1.13–0.86 (br, 18H). Mw = 8.3 × 104, PDI = 2.29.


The copolymer structures and synthetic routes are shown in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1. Compound 4 was prepared by the following steps. Initially, bromination of compound 1 with NBS at 60 °C afforded compound 2. Then bromination of compound 2 in CCl4 afforded compound 3. Compound 4 was prepared from compound 3 by Wittig–Horner reaction. A Stille coupling reaction was performed between compound 6 and compound 7 to afford compound 8, using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. Compound 9 was prepared from compound 8 by Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Then the key intermediates (M1 and M2) were synthesized from compound 4 and aldehyde compounds (compounds 5 and 9) in moderate yields according to Wittig–Horner reaction. The monomers M1 and M2 were prepared for the resultant copolymers PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBTvia a Stille coupling reaction with monomer M3. The structures of the monomers and copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, and MALDI-TOF MS. The two copolymers exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, THF, and chlorobenzene. Table 1 summarizes the polymerization results and thermal properties of the copolymers. The molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the two copolymers were Mw = 41.1 kg mol−1 with PDI = 1.87 for PT-Tz-DTBT, and Mw = 83.9 kg mol−1 with PDI = 2.29 for PT-Tz-DTffBT, determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrenes as standards with THF as eluent. In comparison with PT-Tz-DTBT, the molecular weight of PT-Tz-DTffBT is relatively higher but its molecular weight distribution is broader. The molecular weight and weight distribution are related to the conditions of the reaction, the solubility of the polymer, and the purity of the monomers. What is more, the fluorine atoms introduced at the 5,6-positions may also affect the molecular weights. The increase in the molecular weights may have a different effect on their photovoltaic performances.

The thermal properties of the copolymers were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The two copolymers (PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT) have good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to a 5% weight loss at 342 and 350 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Whereas neither phase transition temperatures nor melting peaks of the two copolymers were observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Obviously, the thermal stability of these copolymers is adequate for their applications in PSCs.


The photophysical properties of the copolymers were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. The correlative data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 3 and 4 give the UV-vis absorption spectra of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT in diluted CHCl3 solution and in the film states. The two copolymers show two distinct absorption bands. The first absorption bands with the absorption maxima (λs,max) at 381 nm for PT-Tz-DTBT and 387 nm for PT-Tz-DTffBT can be identified with a delocalized excitonic π–π* transition. The second absorption bands with λs,max at 510 and 513 nm, respectively, can be attributed to a localized transition between donor–acceptor charge transfer states.PT-Tz-DTffBT exhibits a slightly broader absorption which is derived from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the main chain and the conjugated side chains. Obviously, the ICT interactions of PT-Tz-DTffBT are progressively enhanced due to the increase of the electron affinity of the DTffBT group. And the maximum absorption coefficients of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT are 5.31 and 5.58 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1, respectively. The absorption coefficient of PT-Tz-DTffBT is higher than that of PT-Tz-DTBT due to the introduction of fluorine atoms to the side group. In comparison with the absorption spectra of the polymer solutions, the absorption spectra of the films are broadened. The absorption peaks are red-shifted. This phenomenon might result from the enhanced interchain interaction in the solid films, which is probably related to the increased extent of π–π stacking of the backbones and increased polarizability of the film. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT are 1.91 and 1.92 eV, respectively, calculated from the onset of the film absorptions.

The electrochemical behavior of the copolymers was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The corresponding CV curves and data of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT films are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. The redox potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+). The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ was assumed to have an absolute energy level of 4.8 eV in a vacuum. The redox potential of ferrocene is 0.71 V vs. SCE. On the basis of 4.8 eV below vacuum for the energy level of Fc/Fc+, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and electrochemical energy gaps (Eecg) of copolymers were calculated according to the following equations:
HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.09) (eV);
LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.09) (eV);
Eecg = e(Eox − Ered) (eV)
The onset potentials for oxidation (Eox) are observed to be 1.49 and 1.50 V for PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT were at −5.58 eV and −5.59 eV, respectively. It has been demonstrated that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) value in BHJ solar cells is linearly dependent on the difference between the HOMO level of the p-type polymer and the LUMO level of an n-type PC61BM. The two conjugated copolymers with side-chains show a similar HOMO energy level, which predicts that they would achieve a similar Voc value to the resulting PSCs. Besides, two copolymers exhibit deeper-lying HOMO energy levels than −5.20 eV, indicating their good air stability under ambient conditions. The relatively deep-lying HOMO energy levels of the two copolymers may be due to the introduction of the thiazole unit in the backbone, which also contributes to the lower HOMO energy levels of the two copolymers, compared with our reported research. In addition, the LUMO energy levels of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT were −3.65 and −3.57 eV. When comparing the LUMO levels of the copolymers and the acceptor (−4.2 eV for PC60BM), it is seen that the energy differences of LUMO levels are sufficient to result in an efficient charge transfer, that is, higher than the suggested 0.3 eV. And the results indicate that the fluorine atoms in the side-chain have little effect on both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels.

The charge carrier transport properties of conjugated polymers play a key role in the performance of PSCs. To understand the influence of charge carrier mobility of the copolymers/PC61BM blend films on the photovoltaic properties, the hole mobility of the target copolymers was measured by using a space charge limit current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/Polymer:PC61BM/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The corresponding data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 3. The calculated average hole mobilities of PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT blend films are 1.8 × 10−3 and 2.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobility of PT-Tz-DTffBT increases due to the fluorine substituent, from the DTBT unit to the DTffBT unit. And the noticeable increase of hole mobility by the fluorine substitution may contribute to the enhancement of Jsc (7.75–9.05 mA cm−2) and FF (0.45–0.54) (see below). In short, the hole mobilities of the two copolymers are relatively high, which is one of the reasons that we obtain the high power conversion efficiencies.

In order to check whether the conjugated side groups and the thiazole unit of the two copolymers make a contribution to the photoelectric conversion in the PSCs, the bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated with four devices, three conventional sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/copolymer:PCBM (∼100 nm) (1:2, w/w)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm) mixing copolymer with PC61BM or PC71BM, and an inverted device of ITO/TIPD (12 nm)/copolymer:PC71BM (∼100 nm) (1:2, w/w)/MoO3 (24 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active layers were spin-coated from dichlorobenzene. Fig. 6 shows the best J–V curves of the devices under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table 3.

Note that PSCs based on PT-Tz-DTffBT demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than PT-Tz-DTBT, with a PCE of 3.75%. In comparison with PT-Tz-DTBT, PT-Tz-DTffBT shows a higher Jsc of 9.05 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the IPCE spectrum. Notably, the copolymer PT-Tz-DTffBT which contains two fluorine atoms in the side group has the higher PCE value than PT-Tz-DTBT, which is due to the increase of the FF value and Jsc value, which can also be ascribed to the increase of the hole mobility.
For other testing conditions, we found no further improvement by using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive. In addition, the photovoltaic properties of PT-Tz-DTffBT were investigated in BHJ solar cells using PC71BM as the acceptor. We obtain the power conversion efficiency of 3.65% (Jsc = 8.92 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, FF = 0.51). Although the open-circuit voltage (Voc) improved from 0.76 V to 0.80 V, both Jsc and FF decreased, so the PCE of PT-Tz-DTffBT has no further improvement (Table 3).
In order to better understand the device characteristics, we have also fabricated an inverted PSC with the device structure of ITO/TIPD (12 nm)/PT-Tz-DTffBT:PC71BM (∼100 nm) (1:2, w/w)/MoO3 (24 nm)/Al (100 nm). A high PCE of 4.42% has been demonstrated, with the highest Jsc of 10.11 mA cm−2, the highest Voc of 0.88 V, and a FF of 0.50 (Table 3). Obviously, the enhanced PCE benefited from the improvement in Jsc and Voc, which were attributed to the reduced photodegradation of the copolymer active layer presumably.
It is noteworthy that the PCE improved significantly from 2.63% of PT-Tz-DTBT to 3.75% of PT-Tz-DTffBT. This can account for the obvious increase in Jsc as revealed by incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 7) which may result from the better charge transfer and the decrease of electron aggregation by improving the miscibility between PT-Tz-DTffBT and PC61BM.
As we know, the FF value is mainly determined by film morphology. The better morphology of the copolymers could be beneficial to a higher FF. Fig. 8 shows the surface morphology of the active layers of copolymer:PC61BM (1:2 w/w) in AFM height images and phase images. As is clearly evidenced by AFM height images (Fig. 8a and b), the PT-Tz-DTffBT film displays a smooth and featureless image over the 3 × 3 μm2 scan area, suggesting a relatively homogeneous morphology, that obviously precedes the image of PT-Tz-DTBT. From phase images (Fig. 8c and d) of the two copolymers PT-Tz-DTBT and PT-Tz-DTffBT, we can see that introducing the fluorine atoms to the side group promoted phase separation. In short, by introducing the fluorine atoms to the side group, the FF and Jsc values of PT-Tz-DTffBT were enhanced, which was correlated with their morphology and hole mobility. It may also be related to the molecular weight. When the molecular weight is not very high, the film-forming property and phase separation of the polymers/PC61BM can be improved by increasing the molecular weight, then lead to a higher FF and Jsc value, and the PCE was improved.

In summary, two new benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene and thiazole (Tz) copolymers with DTBT and DTffBT side chains were successfully synthesized and characterized. Both of the copolymers exhibited good thermal stability. The research results showed that the conjugated side chains could broaden the absorption spectra as well as improve the hole-transporting properties, and in turn improve the power conversion efficiencies. Two copolymers appeared promising for the application in BHJ solar cells due to their good solubilities, low band gaps as well as their high hole mobilities. The broad absorption spectrum, deep HOMO energy level and the noticeably high hole mobility of PT-Tz-DTffBT contributed to the outstanding Jsc and Voc values as well as the high PCE of 3.75%. The PCE of the inverted device based on PT-Tz-DTffBT reached to 4.42%, which showed that PT-Tz-DTffBT was promising for potential applications in photovoltaic cells. These results indicated that the chemical modification thus provided a simple and effective way for tuning the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers.
