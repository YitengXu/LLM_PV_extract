Cs3Bi2I9 is a promising inorganic, nontoxic, and stable perovskite material for solar cell applications, but the power conversion efficiency of Cs3Bi2I9-based solar cells is relatively low because its band gap is too large and indirect. Here we show that the band gap and optoelectronic properties of Cs3Bi2I9 can be improved by alloying Br into Cs3Bi2I9, despite the common expectation that the band gap of the Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx alloy will increase with Br concentration. By systematically growing and characterizing Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx perovskite materials, we discover that at x = 3 Cs3Bi2I6Br3 shows the lowest bandgap of 2.03 eV, while that of Cs3Bi2I9 is 2.20 eV. Our photophysical characterization and density functional theory calculations show that this unusual band gap reduction and better optoelectronic properties at x ∼ 3 are mainly caused by a phase transition from the P63/mmc phase to the Pm phase. Moreover, we found that the composition engineering also leads to compact Cs3Bi2I6Br3 films with high crystallinity and orientation, which results in a champion device with a PCE of 1.15%. This novel discovery will definitely deepen our understanding of Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx materials and afford more promising strategies for highly stable lead-free perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved significant progress with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% in the past decade. They seem to be a promising technology in mass production for solar electricity conversion. However, there still remain two major concerns, the toxicity of lead and stability of the absorber layer. Therefore, developing non-toxic and air-stable lead-free absorber materials has attracted increasing attention in the last few years. From the same family as lead, tin is viewed as the superior candidate to replace lead. Unfortunately, tin based perovskite materials suffer from severe instability because Sn is relatively light, so Sn2+ is easily oxidized into Sn4+. Moreover, the ionic radius of Sn2+ is considerably smaller than that of Pb2+, which can also lead to lattice distortion and phase instability. On the other hand, Bi is next to Pb in the periodic table, so Bi3+ matches better with Pb2+ and Bi-based perovskites show higher stability compared with Sn-based perovskites. Therefore, more researchers dedicated themselves to exploring the photovoltaic properties and device performance of Bi-based perovskite materials. Johansson et al. first reported ternary Bi-based halide perovskites with the chemical structure A3Bi2I9 (A: Cs+ or MA+) and obtained devices with a PCE of 1.09% based on the Cs3Bi2I9 film as the absorber layer so far. Buonassisi et al. developed a solvent-engineering method to prepare compact A3Bi2I9 (A: MA+, Cs+ or FA+) films with the highest PCE of 0.71% from MA3Bi2I9-based devices. Jain et al. pushed the PCE of MA3Bi2I9-based devices to 3.17% along with high stability via the vapour assisted solution process by exposing BiI3 films to MAI vapour. However, their conversion efficiencies are still low and far from the theoretically predicted efficiency of 22.6%, which may be attributed to the wide and indirect bandgap, non-dense films and low crystallinity of MA3Bi2I9. Therefore, it is crucial to develop high quality bismuth based perovskite films with a narrower bandgap as well as high crystallinity.

The bandgap of halide perovskite materials can be tuned by alloying iodine with bromine or chloride. Unfortunately, so far, band engineering by changing the composition at the anion site is rarely applied in ternary Bi-based perovskite solar cells. In this work, we systematically grew and characterized Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx perovskite materials by alloying Br into Cs3Bi2I9, which is a representative of the more stable inorganic bismuth halide perovskites. We discovered that at x = 3 Cs3Bi2I6Br3 shows the lowest bandgap of 2.03 eV, while that of Cs3Bi2I9 is 2.20 eV. Because the alloying of Br into iodine often results in a larger bandgap due to the low Br valence p orbital energy, this behaviour is quite unusual. We investigated the electronic structures of the alloy by photophysical characterization and by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We showed that the band gap reduction and better optoelectronic properties at x = 3 are mainly caused by a phase transition from the P63/mmc phase to the Pm phase, not by simple optical bowing. Moreover, we found that the composition engineering also leads to compact Cs3Bi2I6Br3 films with high crystallinity and better orientation, which results in a champion device with a PCE of 1.15%.

Here, we prepared a series of Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx thin films with x equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 successively via a one-step spin-coating method. Briefly, all the precursor solutions were obtained by dissolving CsI, BiI3, CsBr and BiBr3 with certain ratios in a mixed solvent (VDMF:VDMSO = 4:1). Then, those Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx films were deposited on NiOx/ITO substrates by spin-coating the precursor solutions mentioned above at a speed of 3500 rpm for 40 seconds, followed by a thermal annealing at 200 °C for 10 min. The detailed experimental information can be found in the ESI. The typical photo images of Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx films (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9) are shown in Fig. 1a. Interestingly, as the x increases from 0 to 3, the film colour turns redder and deeper, while the colour turns back to yellow at x = 4 and changes to bright yellow when the x keeps increasing. The absorption of the films was recorded using our UV-Vis spectrometer and the absorbance spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. The absorption onset shifts from ca. 556 nm (black line) to ca. 580 nm (cyan line) when the x changes from 0 to 3, while it shifts back to ca. 475 nm (green line) when the x continuously increases to 9. It is worthy of note that two ambiguous absorption peaks show up at the wavelengths of ca. 480 nm and ca. 580 nm in the spectrum of Cs3Bi2I7Br2 (blue line), which may indicate two separate phases occurring simultaneously in this sample. It is well known that the alloying of Br into the original I terminated perovskites commonly leads to a blue shift in bandgaps in the same phase structure. The observed bandgap reduction indicates that a phase transition may occur in the continuous composition tuning by replacing I with Br. Therefore, this bandgap modulation derived by composition engineering is beyond our expectation and attracts our attention.

To discover the reason behind this phenomenon, the film phase structure was investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1c shows the evolution of XRD patterns of typical Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx thin films with x equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. As shown in Fig. 1c (JCPDS 23-0847), the fabricated Cs3Bi2I9 film is inclined to be a P63/mmc hexagonal structure, which is in line with previous reports. For the film of Cs3Bi2I9, the preferred orientation is indexed at a 2θ degree of around 25°, which is corresponding to the (006) plane. With the x increasing from 0 to 3, the (006) peak shifts gradually to larger degrees or smaller lattice distances, which can be ascribed to the alloying of Br ions with a smaller radius compared with iodine. In fact, all the crystal planes of the films also move to smaller lattice distances. It's worthy of note that the peak just on the right of (006) belongs to the (202) plane, which merges with the (006) peak and evolves into a broad peak turning up in the pattern of Cs3Bi2I7Br2. This indicates that the phase transition may occur at the Br/I of 2/7, which also accounts for the two separate absorption peaks in the corresponding spectrum of Cs3Bi2I7Br2 (the blue line in Fig. 1b). On the other hand, the XRD pattern of the Cs3Bi2Br9 film is obviously different compared with that of Cs3Bi2I9, which could be indexed to the Pm hexagonal structure (JCPDS no. 44-0714), consistent with previous reports. Two obvious peaks with high intensity indexed at around 16° and 27° are corresponding to the (101) and (003) planes, respectively. With the decrease of Br content, the peaks shift to smaller 2θ degrees or larger crystal distances. The XRD pattern of Cs3Bi2I6Br3 thin films shows the highest peak intensity and enhanced orientation at the Br/I of 3/6, which indicates the optimal crystallinity and improved film quality. To our knowledge, this phase transition phenomenon has never been reported in lead halide based perovskite materials and is for the first time reported here for bismuth halide based perovskites. This phase transition phenomenon is important for understanding the evolution of absorption spectra in this system and Cs3Bi2I6Br3 seems to be the critical point of the phase transition from P63 to Pm with the increase of Br content. Strikingly, Cs3Bi2I6Br3 films show a pure phase with the highest crystalline quality and the smallest bandgap, implying their promising properties for use in photovoltaics.
To study more electronic properties of three typical samples of Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I6Br3 and Cs3Bi2Br9 films, UV-Vis absorbance, photoluminescence (PL) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were applied. Fig. 2a shows the Tauc plots of their absorption spectra, where P63 and Pm are treated as indirect bandgap semiconductors using indirect-Tauc ([αhν]1/2). For the Cs3Bi2I9 film (black line), the phonon assisted indirect bandgap is determined to be 1.85 eV, while 2.23 eV can be attributed to its turn on of the optical (direct) bandgap from absorption, which is also consistent with previous reports of Cs2AgBiBr6 with an indirect bandgap structure. Similarly, the corresponding bandgaps of the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film (red line) are also determined to be 1.75 eV and 2.05 eV, respectively. The blue line in Fig. 2a indicates that the direct bandgap of the Cs3Bi2Br9 film is 2.67 eV. The composition dependent bandgap variation is clearly discovered in this graph. The steady state PL emission spectra in Fig. 2b also confirm the bandgap values determined in Fig. 2a. Here it should be noted that a 480 nm laser near their optical bandgaps was used to excite the Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I6Br3 films due to the excitation-emission coupling effect in the bismuth based perovskite materials. For Cs3Bi2Br9, the excitation wavelength was changed to 405 nm and its emission peak appears at 2.64 eV, which is in accordance with the bandgap determined in Fig. 2a (2.67 eV). For Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I6Br3 films, their main emission peaks are indexed at 1.84 eV and 1.74 eV, which matches well with the indirect bandgap values shown in Fig. 2a. The broad shape of PL emission peaks can be ascribed to phonon scattering along with surface recombination.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was applied to investigate their work function (WF) and valence band maximum (VBM), to reveal more electronic structures of the three typical films. As derived from the onset of the UPS spectra (Fig. S1a), the work functions are determined to be −4.94 eV, −4.88 eV, and −5.11 eV for Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I6Br3 and Cs3Bi2Br9, respectively. From the UPS tails in Fig. S1b, the WF of both Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I6Br3 is determined to be 0.8 eV above the VBM while that of Cs3Bi2Br9 is 0.25 eV, consistent with some previous reports.
To explain the experimental observation, we have performed the first principle calculation using the VASP code. The project augmented wave (PAW) method and the plane wave basis set are employed with an energy cutoff of 350 eV. All the atoms and the lattice vectors are fully relaxed until the force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å−1. For the Brillouin zone integration, we used 6 × 6 × 2 and 6 × 6 × 4 k-point meshes for the P63/mmc and Pm primitive cells, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. For the discussion of the electronic and optical properties, we have employed the PBE functional with spin–orbit-coupling (SOC). Given the fact that the band gap calculated by PBE + SOC is underestimated compared to experimental data, we have used a scissor operator to compensate for the band gap error (Table S1). The valence band maxima (VBMs) of the Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2Br9 are composed of Bi 6s orbitals and anion valence p orbitals, and the conduction band minima (CBMs) of the two compounds are contributed by Bi 6p orbitals (Fig. S2). The calculated band structures of Cs3Bi2I9 (P63/mmc) and Cs3Bi2Br9 (Pm) are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. We found that the two materials have indirect band gaps. The VBM and the CBM of Cs3Bi2I9 (P63/mmc) are located at M and Γ, respectively, with a minimum band gap of 2.32 eV. The narrowest direct band gap is 2.43 eV located at Γ, whereas the optical band gap is 2.63 eV according to the calculated transition matrix. Similarly, the direct band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 (Pm) is 2.71 eV, also located at Γ, whereas the indirect band gap is 2.58 eV (A → Γ). The narrowest optical band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 (Pm) is 2.71 eV (Γ → Γ). According to the experimental observation showing that the complete phase transition occurred when the Br/I reached 3/6, we have also calculated the band structure and absorption coefficients of Cs3Bi2I6Br3 in the Pm phase, shown in Fig. 3e. The trend of the calculated absorption coefficients is in good agreement with the experiment results.
The experimental results, thus, can be explained as follows: in Table 1, we show the band gaps of Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2Br9 in different phases by PBE and PBE + SOC. We see that although the predicted band gaps are different in different calculation approaches, the general trends are the same; that is, the band gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 is larger than that of Cs3Bi2I9 and the band gap of the compounds in the Pm phase is smaller than that of the compounds in the P63/mmc phase. The band gaps of Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx in the P63/mmc and the Pm phases as a function of the composition x are shown in Fig. 3f. From Fig. 3f, we see that the band gaps of the Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx alloys in the P63/mmc phase increase as the Br concentration increases, because more Br 4p orbitals instead of I 5p orbitals contribute to the VBM (Fig. S2). However, when x increases to 3, the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 alloy converts from the P63/mmc phase to the Pm phase, resulting in a dramatic decrease of the band gap. Therefore, the observed absorption red-shift of the Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx alloy is directly attributed to the phase transition.

Following the above electronic structures, the band alignment of the whole device is configured based on both Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I6Br3 because they both have considerably lower bandgaps (Fig. 4a). Here, it should be noted that the device configuration is ITO/NiOx/Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx/PC61BM/C60/BCP/Ag, which follows the former structure of previous inverted planar lead halide perovskite solar cells. Compared with Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I6Br3 shows more suitable band alignment in the electronic structure of devices, besides lower bandgap, which would contribute to better device performance. The corresponding cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the typical device with the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film as the absorber is shown in Fig. 4b. Due to poor secondary electron emission, the cross sectional image is not clear as shown for the lead halide perovskite devices. However, a continuous Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film with a thickness of around 200 nm was formed. As we know, a continuous and dense film is a predominant factor for the device performance. So, obtaining a high quality film is a precondition for the device fabrication and hence for discovering more clearly the intrinsic properties of the materials.
As we know, bismuth halide based perovskite films always suffer from vertically grown sheets in their morphology during the crystal growth process of the absorber layer in the device, which limits the device in the normal mesoporous structure. This was mainly due to their P63 hexagonal structure. Surprisingly, in this work, those easily grown sheets can be evolved into ball-like nanocrystals in morphology by our intentional alloying of Br into Cs3Bi2I9 films. Fig. S3 presents a clear evolution course of the surface morphology of Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx by changing x from 0 to 9. As the I/Br ratio decreases from 9/0 to 7/2, the surface morphology turns from vertical flakes to porous agglomerates of disks. The crucial change in morphology occurs in Cs3Bi2Br3I6 with a compact and dense film. With further decreasing I/Br ratio, the film grains look clear and the grain size becomes larger when the ratio reaches 0/9. Besides phase transition, this may be attributed to the high concentration of Br ions, which also play an important role in improving the quality of lead halide perovskite films.
To further improve the quality of the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film, chlorobenzene (CB) was applied owing to its anti-solvent effect in a quick crystallization course. In order to completely discover its effect on all the Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx films, the corresponding SEM images of the surface morphology of those typical films are recorded, which are shown in Fig. S4. Fig. 4c and d also exhibit the surface morphology of both Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I6Br3. The direct comparison between CB and CB-free processes can clearly demonstrate the effect of CB quenching. Obviously, all the surface morphologies turn to be composed of grains, a typical morphology popular in solar cells. And all the films become more compact and dense. An interesting phenomenon is that the grain size decreases when the I/Br ratio decreases from 9/0 to 7/2 and increases remarkably when the concentration of Br increases. This may be resulted from the phase transition from P63 to Pm discussed in the above XRD patterns and calculation part. For the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film, compared with the film in the CB-free process, the grain boundaries seem to be clearer, implying the potentially enhanced photovoltaic performance. Based on the high quality Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx perovskite films obtained, this work is the first to report effective inverted planar devices based on an all inorganic ternary Bi perovskite as the absorber.

Fig. 5a presents the J–V curves of champion devices for Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I6Br3 films with CB treatment under AM 1.5 G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) for both forward and reverse scans. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.15% can be obtained from the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.64 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 3.15 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.57. In contrast, the pristine Cs3Bi2I9-based device shows a PCE of 0.23% with JSC = 0.51 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.75 V, and FF = 0.59. Compared to the control Cs3Bi2I9-based device, the Br alloying to form the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film results in a significant increase in the JSC from 0.51 to 3.15 mA cm−2, which is definitely attributed to the lower band gap and enhanced absorbance resulted from phase transition from P63 to Pm with composition engineering. In addition, Fig. S6 shows steady photocurrent profiles for as long as 300 s under a fixed bias at the maximum power point. It is obvious that the current densities of both devices stay almost constant with time. The corresponding efficiencies are 1.05% and 0.20% for the control Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I6Br3 devices, respectively, which are comparable to the PCE obtained from I–V curves. To distinguish the difference in performance between the CB and CB-free films, Fig. S5 shows the J–V characteristics of the best device based on the CB-free Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film, which has a VOC of 0.58 V, JSC of 2.55 mA cm−2, FF of 0.44 and PCE of 0.65%. The difference is obvious and can be attributed to the difference in film crystallinity discussed above.

Fig. 5b presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum and corresponding integrated JSC of the champion Cs3Bi2I6Br3-based device. As shown from the EQE spectrum, the integrated JSC value of the optimal Cs3Bi2I6Br3-based device is 3.11 mA cm−2. The slightly lower JSC values compared to those obtained by J–V measurements might be caused by an underestimated spectral mismatch factor. To check the reproducibility, a batch of 36 devices were fabricated with identical fabrication parameters. As shown in Fig. 5c, the distribution of performance parameters for the Cs3Bi2I6Br3 film shows a range from 0.70 to 1.15%, while the PCE of the Cs3Bi2I9 film displays a scale from 0.04% to 0.23%. Those statistics could demonstrate that our devices performed identically with relatively good reproducibility. Furthermore, the better stability of the Cs3Bi2I6Br3-based device is shown in Fig. 5d, and 82% of the original PCE could be maintained after continuous soaking under AM 1.5 G solar illumination without encapsulation (under around 50% humidity at 26 °C), compared with the 75% retained by the control Cs3Bi2I9-based device. This clearly demonstrates the high potential stability of Cs3Bi2I6Br3-based solar cells.

In summary, we systematically synthesized and characterized a series of Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx thin films with x equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Among them, Cs3Bi2I6Br3 shows the lowest bandgap of 2.03 eV, while that of Cs3Bi2I9 is 2.20 eV. As shown by our photophysical characterization and density functional theory calculations, the unusual band gap reduction and better optoelectronic properties at x ∼ 3 are mainly caused by a phase transition from the P63/mmc phase to the Pm phase, although the alloying of Br into iodine often results in a larger bandgap due to the low Br valence p orbital energy. As far as we know, this phenomenon has never been reported in either lead or bismuth halide perovskite materials. Interestingly, this composition engineering also leads to compact Cs3Bi2I6Br3 films with high crystallinity and better orientation. Based on this understanding, we have fabricated, for the first time, effective inverted planar devices using an all inorganic ternary Bi perovskite as the absorber with a champion PCE of 1.15%. Those devices also exhibit high stability in our light soaking tests. These novel discoveries would definitely deepen our understanding of Cs3Bi2I9−xBrx materials and may open a new avenue to develop Bi based optoelectronic devices in the near future.
