An organic ionic plastic crystal, 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (P12TFSI), was synthesized and doped with a room temperature ionic liquid, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII). The prepared PMII/P12TFSI solid-state electrolytes were employed for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), without using any volatile organic solvent. The fabricated solid-state DSSCs yielded a power conversion efficiency of 5.12% under simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 50 mW cm−2. The superior long-term stability of the fabricated solid-state DSSCs indicated that the synthesized PMII/P12TFSI solid-state electrolytes could overcome the drawbacks of cells containing volatile solvents.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention because of their relatively high energy conversion efficiencies and low production costs. Although an overall power conversion efficiency of more than 11% has been achieved for DSSCs, there are still some scientific and technological difficulties that should be overcome before the widespread commercialization of DSSCs. For example, solvent leakage in liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs increases the difficulty of sealing the device and reduces the long-term stability of cells. In order to increase the stability of DSSCs, the problems of leakage and volatility of the liquid electrolyte must be resolved, while the high ionic conductivity and good interfacial contact with the porous TiO2 photoelectrode and the counter electrode must be maintained. To overcome these problems, great efforts have been devoted to replacing the liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes (such as p-type semiconductors, organic hole-transport materials, and solid polymer electrolytes) or quasi-solid electrolytes (such as polymer gels, low molecular weight gels, and ionic liquid-based gel electrolytes). However, compared with liquid electrolytes, all-solid-state electrolytes generally show relatively lower ionic conductivities and poor electrolyte/electrode interfacial contact. Therefore, quasi-solid-state electrolytes have attracted a great deal of interest because of their nonflammability, high conductivity, negligible vapour pressure, and good contact with the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode.

Organic plastic crystals are compounds composed of organic molecules which are rotationally disordered. Solid–solid phase transitions below the melting point result in organic plastic crystals with both plastic properties and good mechanical flexibility. They are often soft and can be deformed easily without fracturing under an applied force. In addition, the plastic properties and the disorder within the organic plastic crystals allow them to display high ionic conductivities of the same order of magnitude as molten salts or aqueous solutions. Therefore, organic plastic crystals are considered as one of the best candidate electrolytes for electrochemical devices because they can facilitate not only high ionic conductivity, but also better interfacial contact between the electrode and electrolyte during the volume changes, and also eliminate the leakage problems of liquid electrolytes. Therefore, plastic crystals have been recently employed as electrolytes for DSSCs. For example, solid or quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on succinonitrile, a molecular plastic crystal, have been fabricated and investigated. Power conversion efficiencies exceeding ∼5% at full sunlight have been obtained.
Herein, we report the development of organic ionic plastic crystals, instead of molecular plastic crystals (such as succinonitrile), as the electrolytes for solid-state DSSCs. Compared with molecular plastic crystals, the advantages of ionic plastic crystal materials are their higher conductivity and very low volatility. In this work, 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (P12TFSI), a well-known example of an organic ionic plastic crystal, which shows a broad solid–solid transformation at 14 °C (entropy of transition 3.1 J K−1 mol−1) and a melting point at 86 °C, was applied as the electrolyte for DSSCs. A room temperature ionic liquid, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), was used as the iodide source for the electrolyte. The DSSCs based on ionic plastic crystal based solid-state electrolytes yielded a power conversion efficiency of 3.92% under simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Further addition of LiI and N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB) to the electrolytes improved the power conversion efficiency to 5.12% under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 50 mW cm−2. The fabricated DSSCs displayed better long-term stability compared to conventional liquid electrolytes, indicating that the PMII/P12TFSI solid electrolyte is a promising candidate for solar cells with good durability.

1-Iodopropane, 1-iodoethane, 1-methylpyrrolidine, 1-methylimidazole, N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB), and LiI were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. LiTFSI was kindly supplied by Rhodia. TiCl4 and H2PtCl6 were purchased from Aldrich. 1-Propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) was synthesized according to a previous report.cis-RuLL′(SCN)2 (L = 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine, L′ = 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine) (Z907) was purchased from Solaronix SA (Switzerland) and used without any further purification.


1-Ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium iodine (P12I) was first synthesized as follows: an amount of 3.0 g (35.0 mmol) 1-methyl pyrrolidine was mixed with 19 ml acetonitrile. Then 6.0 g (38.0 mmol) 1-iodoethane was added dropwise into the prepared 1-methyl pyrrolidine solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Then the solvent was removed and the solid product P12I was washed with ethyl acetate and dry diethyl ether three times. The produced P12I was dried under vacuum at room temperature for more than 48 h to give a white solid: 7.41 g (95% yield). 1H NMR (D2O): 3.54–3.41 (m, 6H), 3.05 (s, 6H), 2.23–2.22 (m, 4H), 1.42–1.36 (m, 3H).

P12TFSI was synthesized as follows: a mixture of 1.60 g (56.0 mmol) LiTFSI and 1.98 g (56.0 mmol) P12I in 50 ml water was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The precipitate was washed with distilled water and then dried under a vacuum at 80 °C to give a white solid: 1.98 g (90% yield). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): 3.48–3.38 (m, 6H), 2.96 (s, 6H), 2.11–2.07 (m, 4H), 1.29–1.24 (m, 3H). Decomposition temperature (Td) of P12TFSI is determined to be 408 °C.

The components of the electrolytes applied in this work are listed in Table 1. All the electrolytes were dried under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h before the characterization and fabrication of DSSCs.

An ionic liquid electrolyte was prepared by mixing PMII (1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide) and I2 (0.1M). The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 30 min and then allowed to cool down to room temperature.


A mixture containing 0.2 g PMII, 0.8 g P12TFSI and 0.0142 g I2 (0.1M) was stirred at 100 °C for 30 min and then allowed to cool down to room temperature to give a solid electrolyte.


To enhance the photovoltage of the cells containing Electrolyte-B, a solid electrolyte based on Electrolyte-B composed of 0.5 M NBB was prepared.


To improve the photocurrent of the cells containing electrolyte-C, a solid electrolyte based on Electrolyte-C containing 0.1 M LiI was prepared.


The conductivity measurements of the electrolytes were carried out on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation equipped with two identical stainless steel electrodes as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. All the samples were equilibrated for at least 30 min at a given temperature. Thermal analysis was carried out by a Universal Analysis 2000 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Samples were heated from 30 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. Steady-state voltammetry was performed in a photoelectrochemical cell equipped with a platinum ultramicroelectrode (∼10 μm in diameter) with a platinum foil as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were tested using a CHI660c electrochemical workstation under dark. The bias voltage for the impedance measurement was −0.75 V and the frequency ranged from 0.01–105 Hz.


The cleaned FTO glass was covered at two parallel edges with adhesive tape to control the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film. Two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto the cleaned FTO glass and used as photoelectrodes. A 10 μm thick film made up of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Next, a second 5 μm thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering anatase particles was coated on top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in 0.5 mM Z-907 ethanol solution at room temperature for 16 h to complete the sensitizer loading. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol was placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate with a hole of diameter 1 mm, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.

The molten plastic crystal electrolyte was filled by back filling under a vacuum. The resultant cells were placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h to guarantee optimal filling and fine electrical contact. The electrolyte injection hole on the thermally platinized FTO counter electrode was finally sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass layer by heating. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs, shielded by an aluminium foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.1 cm2, were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2400) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 15, 50 and 100 mW cm−2, respectively. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), plotted as a function of excitation wavelength, was recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp with a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 260 1/4).

It has been demonstrated that a relatively high conductivity and rapid diffusion of the I−/I3− redox couple through the electrolytes is critical for the solar cell performance. The doping of the ionic plastic crystals could remarkably increase the conductivity because of the fast-ion conduction mechanism. Here, PMII was chosen to dope P12TFSI for the formation of plastic crystal electrolytes with high conductivity. Fig. 1a shows a photograph of the electrolytes applied in this work. It can be seen that the 25 wt% PMII doped P12TFSI electrolytes are solid at room temperature. Fig. 1b shows the differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) thermograms for pure P12TFSI and 25 wt% PMII doped P12TFSI. It can be clearly seen that the melting point of the PMII doped P12TFSI electrolyte was lowered from 90 to 76 °C, compared with pure P12TFSI. These results indicate that PMII has been incorporated into the bulk matrix of P12TFSI to form a solid solution. In addition, the 25 wt% PMII doped P12TFSI electrolytes were solid below 76 °C.


Fig. 2 shows the ionic conductivity of the four electrolytes in the measured temperature region (25–80 °C). The conductivity of all the electrolytes increased with increasing temperature. Among the four electrolytes, Electrolyte-A, shows the highest ionic conductivity. Table 2 shows the ionic conductivity, and apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of I3− at 25 °C. Compared with the ionic liquid electrolyte (Electrolyte-A), the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte (Electrolyte-B) slightly decreased. Since the diffusion of ions strongly depends on the viscosity of the electrolyte, higher viscosity generally leads to lower ionic conductivity. It has already been reported that the addition of an additive (such as NBB), generally decreases the conductivity of the electrolytes and the diffusion coefficients of the redox mediator species containing the redox couples. Therefore, it is not surprising that Electrolyte-C shows the lowest conductivity of 3.15 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. The addition of LiI to the Electrolyte-C slightly increased the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, which might be due to the increased concentration of iodide and Li+ ions.

Steady-state voltammograms of the electrolytes were obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 at 25 °C. The apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of triiodide were calculated from the anodic and cathodic steady-state currents (Iss) using the following equation:
Iss = 4nFDappCa
(1)
where
n is the electron-transfer number per species, F is the Faraday constant, a is the radius of the ultramicroelectrode, and C is the bulk concentration of the electroactive species. The diffusion coefficients are listed in Table 2. It is clear that the liquid electrolyte Electrolyte-A shows the highest diffusion coefficient of and I3− (3.62 × 10−7 cm2 s−1). Although the viscosity of the solid Electrolyte-B is much higher than that of the liquid electrolyte, the diffusion coefficient of I3− is only slightly lowered (3.36 × 10−7 cm2 s−1). We assume that the fast ion transport in this solid electrolyte could be considered as a decoupling of diffusion and shear relaxation times, which probably originates from local defect rotations in the P12TFSI plastic crystal. In addition, for such a P12TFSI plastic crystal-based solid electrolyte, a Grotthus type electron-exchange mechanism appears, therefore, to make a significant contribution to Dapp, which can be expressed by the Dahms–Ruff equation (eqn (2)).

Dapp = Dphys + Dex = Dphys + kexδ2c/6
(2)
where
kex is the rate constant of electron exchange, and c and δ are the concentration and average center-to-center distances between the redox species, respectively. It is not surprising that the addition of NBB decreased the diffusion coefficient of I3− from 3.36 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 to 2.32 × 10−7 cm2 s−1.


Photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs based on the four different electrolytes were measured under standard AM 1.5 solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3a). The results for the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and the overall PCE of the DSSCs are summarized and listed in Table 3.

The cell with the liquid electrolyte, Electrolyte-A, exhibited a Voc of 0.588 V, a Jsc of 12.45 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.654, yielding a conversion efficiency of 4.78% at 25 °C. This efficiency is higher than the cell with solid Electrolyte-B, without any additives. Upon the addition of NBB, the Voc of Electrolyte-C was improved from 0.605 to 0.634 V. The dark current originates from the reduction of I3− by conduction band electrons from TiO2. As shown in Fig. 3b, the onset of the dark current is shifted by approx 100 mV from Electrolyte-C to Electrolyte-B due to the lower I3− reduction rate (ket). The decrease of ket for I3− should lead to an increase in Voc according to the following equation:
(3)
Where
Iinj is the flux of charge resulting from the sensitized injection, relating to the electron back transfer rate, ncb is the concentration of electrons at the TiO2 surface, and ket is the rate constant for I3− reduction in the case of the Electrolyte-C based cell. The addition of NBB reduces the hydrophilic ionic mobility of I3− far from the TiO2 film, generating a lower dark current. Eventually, the reduction rate of ions will be decreased, which leads to an enhancement of the Voc value. Therefore, the Electrolyte-C based cell shows a higher Voc (0.634 V) and a higher PCE (4.01%) as compared with Electrolyte-B. It has been demonstrated that the addition of LiI can distinctly improve the Jsc of the cell. Here, the Jsc of the cell with Electrolyte-D improved from 9.42 mA cm2 to 10.92 mA cm2, resulting in an improved PCE of 4.64%.

The IPCE values of the devices based on the four electrolytes are consistent with the values of Jsc, as shown in Fig. 4. The maximum IPCE values at 530 nm are 65%, 57%, 60% and 64% for Electrolyte-A, B, C and D, respectively. A broad feature appears to cover the visible spectrum range from 450 to 650 nm. The PCE of the devices under different light intensity illumination are also summarized in Table 4. Superior device performances could be obtained under both high and low simulated sunlight irradiations. The DSSC based on Electrolyte-D shows a maximum PCE value of 5.12% under AM 1.5 irradiance at 50 mW cm−2. The PCE at 0.15 sun is lower than that at 0.5 sun because of the photocurrent response to light intensities and the changes in performance parameters, such as a lowered open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Under high light intensity illumination, charge recombination could become the dominant control factor for achieving a similar PCE to that accomplished under low light illumination.

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) have been employed to study the kinetics of the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes, including the interpretation of obvious electronic and ionic processes in DSSCs. Herein, EIS was further applied to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes of the four devices. Fig. 5 illustrates the EIS spectra measured at −0.75 V in dark. From high to low frequency, three semicircles are observed in the Nyquist plots, and R1, R2, and R3 represent the resistances of the Pt counter/electrolyte interface, the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte, respectively. The bigger the semicircle in the intermediate-frequency region, the weaker the electron recombination at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. It can be seen that the addition of NBB increased the resistance of the charge-transfer elements at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. This result is consistent with that of the dark current characterization.

Fig. 5b shows that the Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra display the characteristic frequency peaks of the charge transfer process for all the cells. The effective lifetime of electrons (τe) before recombination in the TiO2 photoelectrode can be related to the inverse of the characteristic frequency and is estimated by the following equation:
(4)
where the middle-frequency peak (
fmax) is the maximum frequency of the low-frequency peak. The fmax and lifetime of the electrons are also summarized in Table 5. The electron lifetime for recombination (τe) of the cell with Electrolyte-A has the highest value of 21.46 ms, and the cell with Electrolyte-B gives the lowest value of 13.96 ms. Therefore, it can be concluded that the solid electrolytes increased electron recombination, leading to weakened electron transfer and further decreased cell performance. However, the cell with Electrolyte-D shows a lower recombination resistance and a longer electron lifetime, which favours electron transport through a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance, and finally leads to enhanced photoconversion efficiency.

To investigate the long-term stability of the DSSCs, an aging test of the sealed cells was carried out. The cells fabricated of the four electrolytes were stored under ambient conditions without further sealing, and the PCE of the cells was measured every four days (as shown in Fig. 6). The total efficiencies were normalized to the values measured on the first day. During the first seven days, the efficiency is moderately enhanced due to an increase of the regeneration rate of dye Z907 and thus an increase of Jsc. The efficiency of the cells with the liquid electrolyte decreased gradually, perhaps due to electrolyte leakage. It should be noted that the cells containing solid electrolytes still retained most of their initial efficiency, even after 50 days, indicating that P12TFSI-based solid electrolytes could suppress the leakage or evaporation of the liquid electrolyte, and therefore result in an excellent practical stability of the devices.

Organic ionic plastic crystal based solid electrolytes have been prepared and employed to fabricate solid-state DSSCs, without using any volatile solvent. The cells with the solid-state electrolytes showed a maximum efficiency of 5.12% under simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 50 mW cm−2, as well as superior long-term stability, which indicated that solid-state DSSCs based on this type of electrolyte could overcome the leakage problem of devices with liquid electrolytes. These results demonstrate a feasible approach for solid-state DSSCs in future practical applications.
