We report on the fabrication of photovoltaic cells, PVs, with controlled donor/acceptor interfaces using a process based on the phase separation between a cross-linkable polyfluorene and polystyrene. Robust, nanostructured columnar-grain layers of a conjugated cross-linked polymer, F8T2Ox1 (an oxetane-functionalized derivative of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-bithiophene)) are obtained after removal of polystyrene. These layers are used, in combination with 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61 (PCBM) deposited by spin coating, to define donor/acceptor interfaces, as PVs' active layers. The performance of these cells is dependent on the dimensions of the surface structures. In particular, a significant power conversion efficiency improvement is observed upon decrease of column diameter, reflecting an improvement of the exciton dissociation. We find, however, that these efficiencies still fall below those of the PVs based on blends of the same components, but are larger than the ones found for planar bilayer PVs. Furthermore, PVs based on blends of cross-linked F8T2Ox1 and PCBM showed enhanced efficiency and thermal stability with respect to PVs based on blends of PCBM and the non-cross-linkable analogue poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-bithiophene). Taking into account that the columnar-grain morphology is recognised as the “ideal” architecture for PVs' active layer provided the column radii are of the order of few nanometres, this work gives a new insight into how to achieve efficient organic photovoltaic cells through the use of cross-linkable conjugated polymers as the electron-donor component.

Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on semiconducting polymers represent a promising technology for solar cells due to several advantages related to the properties and processability of these materials, such as light-weight, mechanical flexibility, low cost, and the possibility of being processed from solutions, as inks. Since Sariciftci et al. reported in 1992 on ultrafast photo-induced electron transfer from a conjugated polymer (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene], MEH-PPV) to fullerene (C60), a wide range of conjugated molecules and polymers as electron-donors (D), and C60 derivatives as electron-acceptors (A) have been investigated for applications in PVs. Both bilayer and blend systems (commonly known as bulk heterojunctions, BHJs), have been studied. In the last five years, significant advances have been reported on the improvement of polymer BHJ solar cells, providing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4–5% for cells with blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a soluble derivative of C60 fullerene, PCBM, and, more recently, with the use of lower-energy gap conjugated polymers and a soluble C71fullerene, PCE values have been increased up to the range 7–8%. In order to achieve the best performance for each organic system, major efforts have been devoted to tailor the morphology and molecular ordering within either the polymer-rich phase or the fullerene phase, by using several methods, such as solvent processing and thermal annealing. However, the blend morphology is typically affected by a wide variety of processing conditions, which are often difficult to reproduce. This has been specially recognized for the P3HT:PCBM system—the most studied one in BHJ cells. In terms of morphology adequacy, BHJ architectures based on donor–acceptor blends provide a large interface for charge separation; still, continuous pathways to ensure efficient charge transport to the electrodes are difficult to establish within the blend. Thus, a columnar-grain layer has been recognized as the most favourable morphology-type for BHJ OPVs. This morphology would consist of interdigitated, segregated domains (columns) of pure donor and of pure acceptor perpendicular to the electrode surface, with radii within the range of the exciton diffusion length of the active components (ca. 10 nm in conjugated polymers). In such an architecture, whereas the nanoscale phase separation between donor and acceptor domains allows for efficient charge generation, as the excitons can reach the D/A interface within their lifetime, the collection of charges is facilitated by the continuous pathways leading the charge carriers to the electrodes, thereby increasing the photocurrent. In addition, direct paths between both electrodes should be avoided, as they act as shunt paths and contribute to charge carrier losses. Hence, each component should be in contact with only one of the electrodes, that is, a layer of D should preferably cover the hole-collecting electrode and a layer of A should cover the electron-collecting electrode. Realizing such “ideal” architecture for the active layer through low-cost techniques is a challenging goal, and few results have been reported in that direction. In particular, surface structuring of the bottom layer made of the conjugated polymer has been achieved via phase separation from blends with an assisting polymer or via nanoimprinting. Nanostructuring of conjugated polymer surfaces via phase separation of blends with assisting polymers was reported by Castro et al., using MEH-PPV and polystyrene (PS), Holdcroft et al., using a P3HT derivative and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and Hoet al. using either a polyfluorene or a soluble PPV and polystyrene. In the processes carried out by Castro et al. and by Hoet al. the critical step is the removal of the assisting polymer with a solvent that does not disturb the surface patterns of the conjugated polymer layer underneath, though Hoet al. do cross-link the conjugated polymer afterwards, using an azide. Holdcroft et al. carry out a thermally-induced side group elimination of the P3HT derivative, which renders it insoluble, prior to the PMMA removal. The use of insoluble surface patterned films of conjugated polymers allows further deposition of the electron acceptor from solution, whereas a thermal deposition is required if the polymer film remains in a soluble form. Hence, the benefits of obtaining insoluble patterned films concern not only with the easy removal of the assisting polymer involved in the patterning method but also with further solution processing. On a different approach, the group of Friend and Huck employed double nanoimprinting to pattern both the polymer donor phase and the acceptor film, either PCBM or a polymer, and demonstrated the improvement of OPVs' performance, even with respect to the cells based on blends of the same materials, upon decreasing the width of imprinted motives down to 25 nm. This result confirms the validity of this approach to improve PVs' performance, though this technique is hardly applicable for large area devices. We believe that the phase separation process assisted by an inert polymer is more promising for real applications, in particular if the conjugated polymer phase can be turned into an insoluble form before removal of the assisting polymer. Within this line of research, we have been investigating the phase separation process between polystyrene and cross-linkable conjugated polymers and its use for PVs.

Here, we report on PVs with nanostructured D/A interfaces, prepared from columnar-grain films of a cross-linked conjugated polymer, F8T2Ox1, as donor, covered by PCBM, as acceptor, and on the effect of morphological changes on the cells' performance. Since the columnar-grain film is made of a cross-linked polymer, it is resistant to solvent processing (insoluble), enabling the deposition of PCBM from solution. Moreover, upon cross-linking, the polymer layer is morphologically frozen and becomes more resistant to temperature variations—an important issue in what concerns PVs' stability. As far as we know, this is the first report on the use of cross-linkable conjugated polymers as structured layers for OPV applications. In spite of the fact that our columnar composite layers do not yet have the optimal dimensions, the accurate information on the film morphology provided by this approach gives insight about the way morphological characteristics of the D/A interface affect device performance. The preparation of the columnar films of the donor polymer was achieved by implementing a patterning method previously reported by us to obtain patterned films of cross-linked conjugated polymers. As mentioned above, it is based on the phase separation occurring during the spin coating of a polymer blend solution containing a cross-linkable conjugated polymer and polystyrene as an assisting polymer.Fig. 1 depicts the four steps involved in this patterning method.
In the first step, a solution containing a mixture of the cross-linkable polymer, polystyrene (PS) and a photo-acid generator (PAG) is spin coated onto an ITO/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate))-covered substrate. The film is then irradiated with UV light and annealed at ca. 100 °C for 5 minutes to promote the cross-linking reaction in the polymer phase. PS is then removed by washing the films with tetrahydrofuran, leaving a robust nanopatterned film over the PEDOT:PSS layer. A solution of the acceptor can then be spin cast on top. We have previously demonstrated that by varying the blend characteristics and the spinning velocity, the details of the phase separation between the two polymers can be controlled, thereby producing patterned films with different column sizes and thicknesses. The cross-linkable polymer used, F8T2Ox1, is analogous to poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-bithiophene) (F8T2) only differing from it by having a side chain with a cross-linkable oxetane group replacing an octyl side group. F8T2Ox1 was prepared through Suzuki coupling polymerization reaction between a dibrominated bithiophene and a fluorene boron ester bearing one octyl chain and one alkyl chain with an oxetane end-group (Scheme 1). Oxetane groups polymerize via cationic ring opening mechanism yielding a three dimensional polymer network.
We have previously reported on the properties of F8T2Ox1 and compared them with those of F8T2. In particular, we reported that the electron affinity (EA) and ionisation potential (IP), obtained by cyclic voltammetry from the onset reduction and oxidation potentials, respectively, for F8T2Ox1 in the soluble form are EA = 2.5 eV and IP = 5.4 eV, while in the cross-linked form EA = 2.6 eV and IP = 5.4 eV. These values are comparable to those similarly obtained for F8T2 (EA = 2.6 eV and IP = 5.5 eV). Hence, considering HOMO and LUMO levels for PCBM (although reported LUMO values in the literature vary from −3.7 eV to −4.3 eV) the obtained electrochemical data allow us to predict that photo-induced charge transfer may occur between cross-linked F8T2Ox1 (identified as r-F8T2Ox1) and PCBM. Fig. 2 displays the energy levels of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM/Al PV cell components. The regular, non-cross-linkable polymer, F8T2 has already demonstrated promising semiconducting properties in polymerBHJ PV cells, when blended with PCBM, exhibiting PCE values of ca. 2%. The previous reports have mainly focused on solvent and thermal annealing, and on varying the ratio between the donor and acceptor to investigate their effect on the PV performance. Akin to P3HT, F8T2 exhibits good hole transport properties and thermotropic liquid crystallinity that allows high self-organization capability. In this work, we characterised OPVs based on columnar-grain films of r-F8T2Ox1, as electron donor, and PCBM, as the acceptor, and compare their performance with those of cells where the two materials are combined either as a blend or in a planar heterojunction (bilayer with “flat” interface).

The experimental details describing the synthesis and structural characterisation of the monomers 2–5 and F8T2Ox1 can be found in the ESI.


Bilayers composed of smooth films of cross-linked F8T2Ox1 covered with a layer of PCBM were prepared both on quartz substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS for optical characterisation and on ITO/PEDOT:PSS-coated glass substrates for PV cells fabrication. Quartz substrates were treated with oxygen plasma and subsequently, a layer (ca. 60 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Bayer, Baytron P) was deposited by spin coating from its aqueous dispersion and dried for 10 minutes at 120 °C on a hot plate. ITO-coated substrates (1.2 × 0.8 cm2) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were then treated with oxygen plasma for 2 minutes before depositing PEDOT:PSS. F8T2Ox1 was dissolved in toluene (10 mg ml−1) containing 4.6 wt% (with respect to F8T2Ox1) of the photo-acid {4-[(2-hydroxytetradecyl)oxyl]-phenyl}phenyliodonium hexafluorantimonate (PAG) (Aldrich Co.). This solution was filtered (0.2 μm, Millipore Millex HV) and spin cast on the PEDOT:PSS covered substrates, at 1800 rpm for 45 s. Afterwards, the cross-linking of F8T2Ox1 was carried out by heating the samples at ca. 100 °C on a hot plate, while illuminating with a 4 W UV light (254 nm) for 1 minute followed by an additional heating period of 5 minutes, under ambient atmosphere. The films were then rinsed with THF and dried under vacuum for 15 minutes. After imaging the films' surface with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), a filtered solution of PCBM (33 mg ml−1) in chlorobenzene (CB) was spin coated on top at 1800 rpm for 45 seconds.


These films were prepared both on quartz/PEDOT:PSS and on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates. Separate solutions of F8T2Ox1 (26 mg ml−1) and monodisperse polystyrene (GPC standard, Mw = 2 × 104) (Fluka) (26 mg ml−1) were prepared in toluene. The photo-acid generator (PAG) was dissolved in THF (6 mg ml−1). Polymer blend solutions were prepared by mixing the adequate volumes of F8T2Ox1, PS and PAG solutions and stirred overnight. The solutions were filtered (0.2 μm, Millipore Millex HV) and deposited by spin coating onto PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates. Three different columnar-grain films were prepared. Films identified as “Columnar I” were prepared from polymer solutions with 6 mg ml−1 of F8T2Ox1, 1:1 CP:PS ratio (by weight) (CP: conjugated polymer) and spinning velocity of 1800 rpm. Films identified as “Columnar II” were prepared from solutions with 4 mg ml−1 of F8T2Ox1, 1:1 CP:PS ratio, and spinning velocity of 2700 rpm. Films identified as “Columnar III” were prepared from solutions with 3 mg ml−1 of F8T2Ox1, 1:3 CP:PS ratio and spinning velocity of 3600 rpm. PAG concentration in these solutions was kept constant with respect to the CP content (4.6 wt%). The films were submitted to the cross-linking protocol, washed with THF to remove PS, and their FTIR spectra recorded to confirm the complete removal of PS (disappearance of bands at 3030, 3060, and 3090 cm−1). Under these conditions no conjugated polymer is removed upon rinsing with THF. The films of cross-linked polymer, r-F8T2Ox1, were imaged by AFM and a PCBM chlorobenzene solution was afterwards spin coated on top.


PCBM and F8T2Ox1 were both dissolved, in the desired concentrations, in chlorobenzene, and PAG, previously dissolved in THF, was added to that solution (4.6 wt%, with respect to F8T2Ox1). The final solutions were filtered and then spin coated (1800 rpm, 45 s) either on PEDOT:PSS-coated quartz substrates or on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates prepared as previously described. In the case of the r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM blends, the films were submitted to the cross-linking protocol except that they were not washed with THF, to prevent PCBM removal. Blends of F8T2 and PCBM were similarly prepared (but without submitting the films to the cross-linking protocol).


The surface morphology was imaged using Atomic Force Microscopy performed on a Molecular Imaging Agilent (model 5100) system operating in non-contact mode (at a resonance frequency between 200 and 400 kHz) using silicon probes with tip radii lower than 10 nm. All images were acquired with 250 × 250 pixels resolution and processed using the same levelling procedure with the final images indicating a flat planar profile, as expected. Gwyddion (version 2.9) software was used to process the images. Thicknesses were determined by doing scratches in the films and imaging them with AFM. The film thickness corresponds to the height difference between the quartz substrate surface exposed by the scratch and the maximum height of the surface motifs, averaged over several positions, after subtracting the PEDOT:PSS layer thickness (determined also by AFM). FT-IR spectroscopy was performed on a Mattson 1000 spectrophotometer. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Cecil 7200 Spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were acquired using a SPEX Fluorolog 2121, collecting the emission at a right angle arrangement in the S/R mode. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for the wavelength response of the instrumental system. Fluorescence decays were measured using the picosecond time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique. The experimental set-up is described elsewhere. The samples were excited with vertically polarized pulsed light, setting the emission polarizer at the magic angle (54.7°). The sample plane was adjusted at an angle of 40° with respect to the excitation laser beam. This arrangement prevents reflection of the excitation beam into the analyzer. The fluorescence decays were collected until accumulating 104 counts at the maximum. The experimental excitation pulse (FWHM = 19 ps) was measured using the light scattered by the films. The fluorescence decays were analysed using the deconvolution program of George Striker. The time resolution of the apparatus is ca. 3 ps.


Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer structures prepared according to the described procedures for each device architecture were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box and ca. 1.5 nm of LiF and 100 nm of aluminium were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask at a pressure below 3 × 10−6 mbar, defining a PV active area of 0.16 cm2. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured under inert atmosphere (N2). Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices were measured with a solar simulator (Oriel instruments 92250A-1000) with simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at 72.2 mW cm−2. The light intensity was determined by a calibrated reference solar cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded under short-circuit conditions, using a home made system with a Xe lamp as light source.



Fig. 3 shows AFM topographic images and sectional views of the cross-linked F8T2Ox1 (r-F8T2Ox1) films used in the preparation of the PVs with planar bilayers and three columnar-grain layers, before depositing PCBM.

The films of r-F8T2Ox1 in planar bilayers exhibited a root-mean-square surface roughness (Rrms) of ca. 1.6 nm, being therefore considered flat. The films identified as “Columnar I”, “Columnar II”, and “Columnar III” exhibit true columnar-grain structures with decreasing average column diameters (see Fig. 3, Table 1 and histograms in Fig. SI of ESI). As for the average column height, this is higher in “Columnar I” films (80 nm) and similar (ca. 40 nm) in “Columnar II” and “Columnar III” films. For the three columnar-grain films, the comparison of thicknesses with the average column height, determined through the sectional views along lines in AFM images, indicates that these films contain an underlayer (UL) covering the whole substrate surface area (PEDOT:PSS) which sustains the columnar structure, with a common thickness of ca. 40 nm for the three columnar-grain films. As mentioned above, the presence of this underlayer is expected to prevent the loss of electrons via leakage paths in the acceptor (the acceptor cannot contact the PEDOT:PSS layer because this is sheltered by the donor polymer). The decrease of the column diameters on going from “Columnar I”, to “Columnar II” and to “Columnar III” is accompanied by a decrease of the average separation between the columns and an increase in number of columns.

The thicknesses of the active layers after PCBM deposition are significantly higher than the sum of the underlayer thickness and the column height for the corresponding films, evidencing a PCBM layer completely covering the columnar-grain polymer film. The presence of the PCBM layer covering the whole columnar-grain film was also confirmed by the AFM phase images, indicating the presence of a single material at the surface (see Fig. SII in ESI).
The current density–voltage characteristics under illumination for the PV cells based on the various active layer architectures are shown in Fig. 4. Table 1 summarizes the morphologic characteristics of these films and the average PV cell parameters (open circuit voltages, VOC, short circuit current densities, JSC, fill factors, FF, and power conversion efficiencies, PCEs) derived from the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves. Various blends, with different r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM weight ratios, and the effect of a further annealing at 100 °C for 30 minutes were studied and the results compared with the PVs based on the regular polymer F8T2 blended with PCBM.
Concerning the efficiency of the r-F8T2Ox1-based cells, we found that those made with blends are the most efficient ones (reaching 2.38%), whereas that made with the planar bilayer exhibits the lowest PCE (0.07%) and Jsc values. PCEs for the PVs with nanostructured interfaces, “Columnar I” to “Columnar III”, lie in between. This sequence is likely due to more efficient exciton dissociation in the case of the blends, due to the expected largest interfacial area between the donor and acceptor. Although the columnar-grain layers do not exhibit the optimal column dimensions (less than ca. 20 nm in diameter and column separation) there is a significant improvement of the current generation and PCE values relative to the planar bilayer, which is in agreement with the larger interfacial area between the donor and acceptor and consequent increase of exciton dissociation efficiency. However, if compared with cells made from blends, the presence of columnar domains of either the donor or the acceptor favouring the charge transport towards the electrodes, does not appear to compensate for exciton losses caused by the smaller interfacial area. Furthermore, in spite of possessing an underlayer, as desirable, this may lead to a significant exciton loss due to excessive thickness (ca. 40 nm) (the excitons created close to the PEDOT:PSS/CP interface are too distant from the PCBM phase). In the three columnar-grain based cells, both JSC and PCE increase with the reduction of the average column diameter and column separation, reflecting an increase of dissociation efficiency of the excitons photogenerated in both the polymer and the PCBM phases.
Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out for the various r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM architectures. The fluorescence decays were measured at the wavelength of emission maximum of F8T2Ox1 (550 nm), upon excitation at 440 nm. At this wavelength, the emission of the composite system is only due to F8T2Ox1, as the spectrum of PCBM exhibits only a weak peak at ∼720 nm (Fig. 5). The fluorescence decay of the films of r-F8T2Ox1 on PEDOT:PSS is fitted by a sum of two exponential terms (see Fig. 6), with an average lifetime, 〈τ〉 = 67 ps, calculated as:
〈τ〉 = ∑Aiτi

τi being the decay times and Ai the corresponding pre-exponential factors.

When in the presence of PCBM, a decrease of the fluorescence lifetime is obtained, depending on the type of layer structure, which is an indication that excited state charge separation occurs at the interface between F8T2Ox1 and PCBM, therefore affording an additional non-radiative process for photogenerated excitons in the polymer. The decrease of the fluorescence lifetime for “Columnar I” film of r-F8T2Ox1 upon deposition of PCBM is shown in Fig. 6. The decay is fitted by two exponential terms, and the average lifetime is 33 ps.
The average lifetimes for the films with different architectures are: planar bilayer (35 ps) > Columnar I/PCBM (33 ps) > Columnar II/PCBM (30 ps) > Columnar III/PCBM (28 ps) > Blend (1:1) (16 ps). Considering the time resolution of the experimental setup (3 ps), meaningful variations in lifetime values can only be considered for the sequence: planar bilayer > Columnar III/PCBM > Blend. Therefore, exciton dissociation efficiency should follow the order: Blend > Columnar III/PCBM > Planar bilayer, which is consistent with the increase of JSC and PCE values along this sequence. Within the columnar film series, in view of the experimental uncertainty, we cannot establish the true order in fluorescence lifetimes, due to their small differences. Column height may affect the cell performances in two ways: taller columns increase the interfacial area, therefore, increasing the exciton dissociation probability, however, in view of the large column diameter compared to the exciton diffusion length (ca. 10 nm), if the columns are too tall, they may also act as filters for the incident light along the column, as excitons created well inside the columns will not be able to reach the interface during their lifetime. This will decrease the polymer contribution for charge generation. Taking into account that the polymer is the main absorber of the solar spectrum, the low PCE and JSC values obtained for “Columnar I”-based cells should reflect some filter effect coming from the larger column height in such morphology. It is worth noting that VOC and FF increase in the sequence Columnar I < Columnar II < Columnar III, indicating a more efficient charge generation and transport along the same sequence.
To gain more insight into the influence of the r-F8T2Ox1/PCBM interfacial nanostructure of the columnar-based PV cells on their performance, we determined the spectral response of the photocurrent. The external quantum efficiency (as a function of the wavelength of incident light) is shown in Fig. 7. For comparison, the UV-visible absorption spectra are also shown. Combining the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 7 (top graph) with those of Fig. 5, we conclude that the absorption spectra of the nanostructured r-F8T2Ox1/PCBM layers are well described as the sum of the absorption spectrum of each component, indicating the absence of ground state charge transfer. EQE spectra for the cells based on columnar-grain films show two maxima, at ca. 340 nm and at ca. 455 nm, which are related to the PCBM and the polymer contributions to the photocurrent generation, respectively. The more intense peak of the EQE spectra at ca. 455 nm in Columnar I/PCBM and Columnar II/PCBM cells indicates a higher contribution of the polymer for the photocurrent than that of PCBM.
The absorption spectra of the polymer-only based patterned films (Columnar I, II, and III films), shown in Fig. 7, reveal a small decrease in the absorption intensity along the series: “Columnar I” > “Columnar II” > “Columnar III”, which scales with the polymer content of the films. Indeed, we have estimated the polymer content of each film by taking into account the morphologic characteristics of the columnar-grain films obtained by AFM (underlayer thickness, column height, column diameter and density of grains), and found the same order. In contrast, the intensity of the EQE peak at 455 nm, assigned to the polymer contribution, follows the reverse order, that is, it is maximum for the cells with “Columnar III/PCBM” films and minimum for those with “Columnar I/PCBM” films. This indicates that exciton dissociation and at the interface and/or charge transport within the cell decrease along the series: Columnar III/PCBM > Columnar II/PCBM > Columnar I/PCBM, at variance with the relative polymer content. Considering that the polymer is the main contributor to the photocurrent generation, due to its better absorption of the solar spectrum relatively to PCBM, we therefore conclude that the variation on the intensity of the peak at 455 nm in the EQE spectrum of the three PVs based on the columnar films is consistent with the variations of the column diameter (which is lower for the Columnar III films), number of columns per unit area and the concomitant dissociation efficiency (higher for Columnar III) of the excitons generated within the polymer phase.
The power conversion efficiency of the cells based on the blends of r-F8T2Ox1 and PCBM is higher than that of the cells based on the bilayers with nanostructured interfaces and varies with the PCBM content. PCE values increase from 1.42%, for a 1:1 r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM weight ratio, to 2.35% for cells with the 1:2 blend ratio and then decrease to 2.08% for cells with 1:3 ratio (Table 1). The same trend is found for the corresponding JSC curves. Several authors have reported on the decrease of PCE and JSC upon increase of PCBM loading in polymer:PCBM blends-based cells as being due to an increased aggregation of PCBM, which is detrimental for the charge separation and/or leads to an unbalanced charge transport. Other authors have justified such influence within the so-called “percolation theory”; a high fullerene concentration is necessary to increase phase separation between donor and acceptor thus enhancing charge transport by establishing interconnected paths between the two components; however, at a certain point the increase of PCBM load causes the polymer concentration to be insufficient and percolation channels for holes along the polymer phase are disrupted.AFM images (topography and phase) for the three blends, with different PCBM contents, did not reveal obvious aggregates of either the polymer or the PCBM components (see Fig. 8 for the cell with 1:1 blend and Fig. SII in ESI) at the surface of the films. Though, from these data, we cannot rule out the presence of large aggregates inside the film, we consider that percolation phenomena are most likely at the origin of the observed non-monotonic effect of PCBM content on PCE.
We also observe that cells based on blends of r-F8T2Ox1 are more efficient than those based on F8T2, when the polymers are blended with PCBM in a 1:1 weight ratio, exhibiting also higher JSC values (Table 1). Similar PCE and JSC values to those shown in Table 1 were obtained by Huang et al. for cells with F8T2:PCBM blends with the same composition (1:1). The higher photocurrent measured for the cells with r-F8T2Ox1, when comparing with those of F8T2, is at variance with hole mobilities determined in field-effect transistors for these two polymers (μ(F8T2) = 6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 and μ(r-F8T2Ox1) = 8.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1). Though bulk mobility may be quite different from TFT mobility, bulk conductivity and photoconductivity studies have also evidenced a decrease of conductivity upon functionalisation of F8T2 with oxetane groups and further polymerisation, which we attribute to disorder of the cross-linked network and charge trapping.AFM studies of r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM and F8T2:PCBM 1:1 blends surface (Fig. 8) show that the r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM blend is more homogeneous, and presents a lower surface roughness (Rrms = 0.78 nm for r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM, while Rrms = 1.09 nm for F8T2:PCBM). No clear lamellar-like domains, indicative of F8T2 crystallites, nor large PCBM clusters were, however, found in the F8T2:PCBM film.
In order to explain the relative PVs' efficiency, we propose that r-F8T2Ox1 leads to a more efficient film morphology when blended with PCBM than F8T2. Being more amorphous than F8T2, r-F8T2Ox1 is likely to be less prone to phase separation from PCBM, leading to a more favourable morphology to exciton dissociation.
The effect of annealing, at ca. 100 °C for 30 minutes under inert atmosphere (N2), on the performance of PVs based on the r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM blends was also studied. While FF is not affected, a 14% increase of the PCE value was achieved for the cell with 1:3 blend (from 2.08% to 2.38%) whereas in the 1:2 case a small decrease occurred (from 2.35% to 2.30%). These results are in contrast with reported data for F8T2:PCBM blends, which indicate a significant detrimental effect on both JSC and PCE values upon annealing at temperatures above 100 °C for a shorter period (20 min). Such higher thermal stability (in performance) of the cells based on r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM blends should be related to a higher morphologic stability when compared with F8T2:PCBM systems, due to the formation of a r-F8T2Ox1 network. Hence, we consider that these are very interesting additional benefits arising from the use of cross-linkable polymers in the PV field besides the possibility of producing nanostructured and robust polymer layers with tunable characteristics. It is also worth mentioning that the VOC values that we obtained for the blends-based PVs, being relatively constant for all the devices, are remarkably high, reaching 1.0 V—this value being, to the best of our knowledge, among the highest reported for BHJ cells based on blends (in comparison, the reported values for cells with F8T2:PCBM, 1:1, blends are around 0.9 V and decrease with the PCBM content in the blend or upon annealing at temperatures above 100 °C).

We have fabricated PV cells with composite columnar-grain films using a cross-linkable conjugated polymer as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor. The surface patterning of the polymer layer was achieved by phase separation from blends with polystyrene, followed by selective cross-linking of the polymer, leading to the formation of a robust conjugated polymer network, which easily allows for the complete removal of PS and further deposition, from solution, of PCBM. The versatility of the method allowed us to investigate the influence of the morphologic characteristics on the performance of the organic photovoltaic cells. We found that upon reduction of the column diameter an improvement of device performance can be achieved. However, as the column diameters, on the order of 250 nm, are still too large, as compared with exciton diffusion lengths in conjugated polymers, we were not yet able to outperform the efficiency of the cells based on blends of the same components. We find that PCE values of the PVs with nanostructured interfaces (0.24%–0.56%) lie in between the values found for the bilayer (0.07%) and for the blends and that a decrease of the size of the patterns leads to improved PCE. As previous studies have shown that, if column diameters are in the range of 25 nm, better performances may be achieved comparing to those for similar cells with blends, the simplicity of this method and its potential application for large area devices strongly suggest that this research line has high potential for the OPV field. PV cells fabricated with r-F8T2Ox1:PCBM blends showed slightly higher PCE and higher thermal stability than similar PVs prepared with the regular F8T2 polymer. The use of cross-linkable conjugated polymers, by virtue of the high structural stability of the polymer networks with respect to heating, may also benefit the progress in cells based on blends.
