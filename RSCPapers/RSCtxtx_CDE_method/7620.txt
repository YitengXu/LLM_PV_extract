A diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based π-conjugated polymer is a very promising low band gap electron donor material for polymer solar cells. We have incorporated alkyl groups into the 4-position of the thiophene rings connected to the DPP fragment, which is proven to be beneficial for improving the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC). Two DPP-based polymers are synthesized with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the electron-donating segment. Both the polymers show good solubility, slightly wide optical band gaps and deep HOMO energy levels when incorporating the alkyl groups. Heterojunction solar cells are fabricated with polymer:PC71BM as the active layer. VOC and JSC are simultaneously enhanced compared to the device performance of traditional DPP-BDT alternating polymers. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.11% was obtained, which indicates that rational utilization of backbone torsion is a promising strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance.

In the past few decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as an approach to direct utilization of sunlight due to their advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, low cost and solution processability for large area device fabrication. Novel materials and device fabrication methods have emerged rapidly for improving the photovoltaic performance through optimization of energy level, film morphology, charge carrier mobility and so on. Encouraging power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% have been achieved in the laboratory for single-junction bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs.

Low band gap (LBG) conjugated polymers exhibit bright prospects for photovoltaic application for their wide optical absorption and great potential for tandem solar cells. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers are intensively investigated as representative LBG materials for single and double junction solar cells. These materials show a wide absorption range and good coplanar structure, which would be in favor of light harvesting and high carrier mobility. In general, DPP-based polymers are incorporated with long side chains on N-atoms to warrant the solution processability. And the adjacent thiophene is not substituted at 3- and 4-positions in order to keep the planar structure. Yang's group has previously reported that the incorporation of large alkyl groups could induce the reduction of PCE for polymer PBDTT-DPP. In order to avoid large alkyl groups, it would be a feasible approach to incorporate an additional alkyl group into the thiophene ring. Although conjugated backbone twist would be induced by this approach, it is reported that the controlled degree of distortion can improve the PSC performance of polythiophene. We have reported that the incorporation of sterically hindered cyclic alkyl groups into DTBT-based conjugated polymers can improve their photovoltaic performance. Interestingly, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) were simultaneously increased, which demonstrated that the steric hindrance effect is an important approach for the design of highly efficient photovoltaic materials. In this article, two new DPP-based conjugated polymers with different side chains were synthesized and the steric hindrance effect on the performance was investigated. Two alkyl groups 2-ethylhexyl and cyclohexyl were introduced into the 4-position of thiophene connected to DPP units, respectively, which have not been reported previously. Two polymers PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH (see Scheme 1) based on DPP and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization. These polymers exhibit good solubility, and meanwhile, both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are decreased. With the optimization of solar cell devices, the efficiencies of 7.25% and 8.11% were obtained for PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of the reported DPP-BDT alternating copolymers with naked thiophene units.

In order to investigate the effect of backbone twist on the photovoltaic performance, 2-ethylhexyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced into the 4-position of the thiophene group of the DPP-monomer with 2-ethylhexyl and 2-butyloctyl side chains on the nitrogen atom, respectively (Scheme 1). The detailed synthetic procedures of DPP-based monomers and copolymers are described in the ESI. Two polymers of PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH were prepared by the Stille coupling reaction between DPP and BDT monomers. These polymers can be readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene (CB), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH are 158.7 and 148.2 kDa, with polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 3.25 and 2.62, respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with THF as an eluent calibrated with a polystyrene standard.

Thermal stabilities of polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere, as shown in Fig. S1. The decomposition temperatures of PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH at 5% weight loss are 423 and 403 °C, indicating high thermal stability of the polymers for application in optoelectronic devices.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of two polymers in chloroform solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1a and the data are summarized in Table 1. Two polymers exhibit very similar absorption profiles due to the identical conjugated backbone. The optical band gaps of PDPP-EH (1.53 eV) and PDPP-CH (1.50 eV) are comparatively larger than that of reported DPP-BDT alternating polymer PBDTT-DPP (1.44 eV), which may be caused by the distortion of the backbone.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to determine the HOMO and LUMO levels of conjugated polymers. As shown in Fig. 1b, the onsets of oxidation potentials of PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH were 0.95 and 0.98 V, respectively, with the corresponding calculated HOMO levels of −5.36 and −5.39 eV, which are lower than that of PBDTT-DPP. The LUMO levels were calculated from the equation: ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg and the corresponding LUMO levels of −3.83 and −3.89 eV were obtained, which are higher than that of PC71BM and hence guarantee the exciton dissociation. The energy levels are summarized in Table 1.

In order to further investigate the effect of the sterically hindered alkyl group on the polymer structure, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in Gaussian 09 program. For computational simplification, the alkyl side chains on the BDT and DPP units were replaced with methyl groups and the backbone was simplified to one repeating unit (n = 1). The structures with a group of ethylhexyl, cyclohexyl and H on the thiophene unit stand for PDPP-EH, PDPP-CH and PBDTT-DPP, respectively.

The optimized molecular geometries of the models are shown in Fig. S2 and dihedral angles are given in Table 2. The torsion angles of θ1 are varied from 9.48° to 13.69°, indicating that thiophene and DPP have good coplanar conformation for all three polymers. Comparatively, torsion angle θ2 shows a large difference ranging from −9.9° for PBDTT-DPP to −42.17° for PDPP-CH with the incorporation of alkyl groups. PBDTT-DPP shows a small torsion angle with a nearly coplanar backbone structure. PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH exhibit a large torsion angle on the backbone and PDPP-CH with cyclohexyl groups is the most twisted. Although the coplanar structure is in favor of the stacking effect and charge mobility, it would also induce strong self-aggregation of the polymer. Incorporation of long side chains could improve the solubility, while this approach would increase insulating content from the side chain and decrease the crystallinity. Interestingly, the appropriate distortion in the backbone as the designed polymers would improve the solution processibility and might increase photovoltaic performance.

The photovoltaic properties of polymers PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH were investigated by fabricating the BHJ solar cells with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The active layers were spin-coated from DCB solution and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to optimize the blend film morphology. All devices were characterized under a solar simulator AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. The details of the device fabrication and characterization are given in the ESI. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The reported polymer PBDTT-DPP with an identical backbone to PDPP-EH/CH is used as the reference and the photovoltaic properties are cited directly from the literature.

Firstly, polymer/PC71BM blend ratios (w/w) of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 were evaluated (Table S1) and it was found that the ratio of 1:2 (w/w) showed the best performance for both polymers. PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH exhibited good PCEs of 7.25% and 6.66%, respectively. As DIO was added, the efficiency of PDPP-EH was reduced to 6.24%. Interestingly, the efficiency of PDPP-CH was increased to 8.11%, mainly due to the increase of JSC from 14.6 to 17.5 mA cm−2. Compared to the reported polymer PBDTT-DPP, PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH exhibit higher VOC, JSC and PCEs. The VOC is increased as predicted, which is in accordance with their HOMO levels. Meanwhile, the JSC is also increased, which indicates that an improved molecular packing and film morphology are formed upon the introduction of steric hindered alkyl groups. However, PDPP-CH shows a slightly lower FF compared to PDPP-EH, which indicates that more intrinsic charge traps are formed in the blend film. Structure disorder could induce the formation of charge traps and recombination. PDPP-CH is more twisted and the crystallization is weaker than PDPP-EH, which can be concluded from the XRD pattern. Therefore, PDPP-CH exhibits a slightly lower FF value.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the best devices of PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH are shown in Fig. 2b. Both polymers exhibit a broad photo-response from 400 to 800 nm. The JSC values integrated from the EQE spectra are 14.6 and 16.9 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with JSC obtained from the J–V measurements.
To further investigate the relationship between the molecular structure and photovoltaic properties, hole mobility was measured via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with a hole-only device configuration of ITO/PEDPOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au.J–V curves are shown in Fig. S3. The hole mobilities (μhole) of the optimized polymer:PC71BM blend for PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH were determined to be 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are similar to that of PBDTT-DPP (2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). As is well known, backbone distortion could break out the coplanarity of the polymer and the mobility would thus be decreased. Interestingly, PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH still exhibit even higher hole mobilities, which would probably result from the well-formed bicontinuous interpenetrating network and/or molecular packing in the blend films. Furthermore, high μhole is also beneficial to obtain high JSC and FF values.
To understand the influence of side chains on the photovoltaic performance, the morphology of the blend film was examined by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In AFM images (Fig. S4), the surface of the PDPP-EH blend film obtained without DIO shows evenly distributed small grains. As DIO is added, the surface becomes much coarser and the root-mean-square (rms) roughness increases from 1.66 to 12.2 nm, which is probably caused by the aggregation of the polymer and PC71BM in the active layer. As for the blend film of PDPP-CH, the surface morphology showed mild evolution and the rms roughness increased slightly from 1.71 nm to 3.35 nm upon the addition of DIO. The increase of roughness may result from the stronger crystallization and phase separation of the blend film, which would lead to a more efficient charge dissociation and transport. Meanwhile, TEM was used to explore the bulk morphology of the blend film (Fig. 3). In TEM images, the bright regions are polymer-rich domains and the dark regions are PCBM-rich domains. A bicontinuous network is formed for the PDPP-EH blend film without DIO; however, the network is disturbed and a severe aggregation is observed with the addition of DIO. As a result, the PCE is dropped from 7.25% to 6.24%. Compared to PDPP-EH, blend film PDPP-CH exhibits a quite homogeneous phase separation without DIO. More clearly, an interpenetrating network is observed with the addition of DIO, which could facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport. The morphology results are fairly consistent with the photovoltaic performance of the two polymers.
The microstructures of the blending films were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) of polymer:PC71BM films processed with or without DIO, as shown in Fig. 4. The blend films only show a wide (100) lamellar diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the edge-on orientations are formed in both blend films. The two polymers exhibit a small lamellar distance of 14.7 and 15.0 Å for PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH, respectively. As DIO is added, the lamellar distance is slightly increased to 14.8 and 15.2 Å, respectively, which indicates a longer packing distance between side chains of neighboring polymer backbones induced by addition of DIO. Furthermore, the lamellar stacking exhibits a quite small distance compared to the widely reported conjugated polymers, such as P3HT (∼17 Å) and PTB7 (∼18 Å), especially much smaller than thiophene-flanked DPP-based polymers (∼20 Å). This compact packing is probably caused by the twisted backbone, which has been reported to decrease the lamellar spacing. The coherence length ζ of the polymer gives information about the lattice disorder, which was calculated by the Scherrer equation. Compared to PDPP-EH, PDPP-CH/DIO exhibits a smaller coherence length (7.8 nm vs. 10.8 nm) with a low intensity, which indicates that a weaker crystallization formed in the blend film. The lower crystallization induced by the disruption of molecular packing would be one reason for the lower FF value of PDPP-CH. Furthermore, the π-stacking diffraction is not observed in the films, which is probably ascribed to the backbone distortion of the polymers.

In summary, two DPP-BDT alternating conjugated copolymers PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH were designed and synthesized with alkyl groups of 2-ethylhexyl and cyclohexyl incorporated into the 4-position of thiophene units, respectively. The influence of sterically hindered groups on the structural, optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the two polymers was fully investigated and compared to the reported PBDTT-DPP without side chains on the thiophene unit. Polymers PDPP-EH and PDPP-CH show slightly wider band gaps and lower HOMO levels. Theoretical calculations reveal that two polymers show a more twisted backbone than PBDTT-DPP and hence the coplanar structure is broken. Both polymers exhibit higher PCEs (7.25% for PDPP-EH and 8.11% for PDPP-CH) than PBDTT-DPP (6.6%). The TEM image indicates that a bicontinuous fibril network is obviously formed in PDPP-CH:PC71BM blend with addition of DIO, which is beneficial for obtaining a high JSC value. Our work demonstrates that the appropriate twisted backbone is an effective strategy to improve PSC performance.


All reactions and manipulations were carried out under Ar with the use of a standard inert atmosphere. Common solvents were dried by standard procedures. Deuterated chloroform, 1,8-diiodooctane and o-dichlorobenzene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All column chromatography was performed with the use of silica gel 200–300 mesh. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-ethylhexyl-2-thienyl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, monomers and polymers were synthesized according to the literature methods. Unless stated otherwise, other reagents were purchased from commercial sources, and used without further purification.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in a Bruker AVANCE-III 600 MHz spectrometer using solutions in CDCl3 and chemical shifts were recorded in ppm units with TMS as the internal standard. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. The electrochemical measurements were carried out under nitrogen on a deoxygenated solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in acetonitrile with a computer-controlled CHI660C electrochemical workstation, a Pt working electrode, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and an SCE as the reference electrode. Potentials were referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) couple by using ferrocene as a standard. The HOMO levels of the polymers were determined using the oxidation onset value. TGA measurements were performed on a STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min under a N2 atmosphere. All GPC analyses were made using THF as the eluant and a polystyrene standard as the reference. Topographic images of the active layers were obtained through atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode under ambient conditions using an Agilent 5400 instrument. Bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were acquired using a HITACHI H-7650 electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The structure of the films was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 ADVANCE). The ground-state geometries of BDT-DTBT molecules were fully optimized by the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.


The PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (30 nm, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was spin-cast on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 4000 rpm and dried subsequently at 150 °C for 30 min in air, and then the device was transferred into a glovebox, where the active layer (100 nm) of the blend of the polymer and PC71BM was spin coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, a Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) metal top electrode was thermal evaporated onto the active layer under about 2 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device was 0.1 cm2 defined by a shadow mask. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.


Hole mobility was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, using a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au by taking current–voltage in the range of 0–5 V and fitting the results to a space charge limited current for a hole-only device. In the presence of carrier traps in the active layer, a trap-filled-limit (TFL) region exists between the ohmic and trap-free SCLC regions. The SCLC behavior in the trap-free region can be characterized by using the Mott–Gurney square law,
where
ε is the static dielectric constant of the medium and μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the polymer thickness.


Monomer 1 (0.2 mmol), monomer 2 (0.2 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (1.8 mg, 0.002 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 0.012 mmol) were dissolved in 6 mL toluene in a 25 mL round bottom flask protected by argon. The flask was purged three times with successive vacuum and argon filling cycles. The oil bath was heated to 110 °C gradually, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 18 h at 110 °C under an argon atmosphere. After cooling, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and precipitated in 200 mL methanol. The precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol and hexane successively in a Soxhlet apparatus to remove oligomers and catalyst residue. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and precipitated in methanol. The precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum at 40 °C overnight.
