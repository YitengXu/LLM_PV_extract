The increasing electron-donating ability of the donor part is focused to further optimize the light-harvesting capability. Our strategy is to introduce an additional donor group into the indoline unit in the donor part to form a donor–donor structure (D–D moiety). Three different units (carbazole, fluorene and 4-methylphenyl groups) with different degrees of electron-donating capability are incorporated, thus constructing the specific donor–donor–π–acceptor (D–D–π–A) system (C-CA, F-CA and I-3) and giving a systematic view of the absorption evolution. Through molecular engineering, their light-harvesting capabilities, energy levels and photovoltaic performances were studied. As expected, utilizing strong electron-donating carbazole unit as additional donor, the IPCE spectrum of DSSC based on C-CA is successfully broadened to NIR region on the premise of suitable LUMO level, with an extraordinarily high plateau in visible region till around 700 nm. In the system of C-CA and F-CA, the introduction of n-pentyl group in donor part of carbazole and fluorene unit has little effect on preventing the molecular π-aggregation due to the good co-planarity of π-linker (vinyl thiophene), suggesting that the most effective way to prevent π-aggregation is still the incorporation of long alkyl groups into planar π-linker segment. However, the introducing long alkyl group can effectively prevent the electron recombination between electrons in conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and I3− ions. Along with the preferable light-harvesting capability, C-CA presents excellent IPCE performance with a short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 18.53 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 649 mV, a fill factor of 0.71, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.49%. The internal relations between chemical structure and conversion efficiency provide a strategy for developing highly efficient organic sensitizers working in whole visible region with high photovoltaic performance.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as promising candidates for solar-energy conversion devices, have attracted considerable attention due to their high performance and the potential of low-cost production. As the critical component of DSSCs, sensitizers including ruthenium complexes and organic dyes have been intensively investigated. DSSCs based on the ruthenium dyes can produce an outstanding photoelectric conversion yield (η) under standard AM 1.5 irradiation. In contrast with ruthenium complexes, organic dyes have been extensively explored in recent years due to their low material costs, ease of synthesis and modification, high molar extinction coefficients, and environmental friendly characteristics. However, the photovoltaic performance of metal-free organic dyes still lag behind the ruthenium complexes. One of the most important factors is their relatively narrow absorption bands in visible region, which is a stumbling block in the enhancement of the crucial parameters of photocurrent density (Jsc) in DSSCs. Accordingly, the development in organic sensitizers with wide wavelength response becomes attractive.

In metal-free organic sensitizers, the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) system is the most common character. Generally, there are three ways to shift the absorption to the longer wavelength: (i) increasing electron-donating ability of donor; (ii) enhancing electron-withdrawing ability of acceptor; and (iii) expanding the π-linker. Among these three aspects, the donor segment is more preferable. Many functional groups, such as indoline, triphenylamine, fluorene, coumarin, and carbazole have been applied as donor and gained different effects. Within these groups, indoline unit, possessing strong light-capturing and electron-donating abilities, has been proven to be an excellent candidate as donor segment. Some sensitizers containing indoline group as donor have been synthesized and shown very promising results. Horiuchi et al. combined indoline derivatives with rhodanine ring and obtained series of dyes with relatively broad action spectrum and high conversion efficiency up to 8.00%. We have also reported an indoline-based sensitizer. Using a 5.0 μm TiO2 electrode, 7.41% conversion efficiency was obtained while N719 produced 7.03% under the same conditions. To date, many structure optimizations have been performed on indoline dyes to improve their light harvesting capabilities and photovoltaic performances. However, nearly all of them were focused on π-conjugation linker and the acceptor parts. While adsorbed on TiO2 electrode, the onset wavelengths of these indoline dyes are only around 700 nm, which means that they still can not harvest all solar energy in visible region. Therefore, to obtain organic sensitizers even working in the NIR region, it is still necessary to optimize their chemical structures and absorption properties for further improving photovoltaic performance via molecular engineering.
In this work, our research is focused on further increasing electron-donating ability of donor part to optimize the light-harvesting capability. Our strategy is to introduce another donor into indoline group to form a donor–donor structure (D–D moiety). Then, this D–D moiety is allowed to connect with π-linker and acceptor to form a D–D–π–A system. Herein, we performed the molecular engineering of the indoline group by introducing three different units (carbazole, fluorene and 4-methylphenyl groups) with different degree in electron-donating capability, thus giving a systematical envision in the absorption evolution for target sensitizers (C-CA, F-CA and I-3 (ref. 6c), shown in Scheme 1). The ethene bridge (vinyl thiophene) was applied as π-linker segment, and cyanoacetic acid was used as acceptor moiety. Moreover, the long alkyl segments on carbazole and fluorene units were introduced to prevent charge recombination by blocking I3− ions away from TiO2 surface. Comparing with F-CA and I-3 anchored on TiO2, the onset wavelength of C-CA with much stronger electron-donating ability of carbazole unit is successfully red-shifted to around 850 nm, thus realizing a panchromatic response, even working in NIR region. As far as we know, such systematically molecular engineering of donor part was firstly performed on indoline dyes. Along with the perfect light-harvesting capability, C-CA presents a preferable broad IPCE action spectrum as well as excellent photovoltaic performance with Jsc of 18.53 mA cm−2, Voc of 649 mV, ff of 0.71, and η of 8.49%. We can also investigate the contributions of different donor groups, and build spectral response and energy level libraries to reveal the internal relations between chemical structure and photovoltaic efficiency, thus enhancing our knowledge regarding the design and optimization of new sensitizers with high performance.

12 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with 4 μm scattering layer were prepared and modified following the reported procedure. The thickness of TiO2 film was measured by a surface profiler (Dektak Co., Ltd., Model DAKTAK II). The dye-loaded electrodes were prepared by dipping TiO2 electrodes (1.2 cm × 0.8 cm) into 0.3 mM dye solution (CHCl3–C2H5OH = 3/2) with 30 mM DCA for 5 h. To prepare the counter electrode, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) with the heat treatment at 500 °C for 30 min. In this work, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidiazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.6 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile was used as the redox electrolyte.

Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp (OTENTO-SUN II, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a reference silicon cell (BS-520, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. Cell active area was controlled to be 0.142 cm2 by a metal mask. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with a monochromator (M10-T, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.). The intensity of monochromic light was calibrated by a reference silicon cell (S1337-1010BQ, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.). Each value in this work was an average of three samples while the standard deviations were lower than ±0.5%.

Electron lifetime and electron density in the complete dye-sensitized solar cell devices were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of the photocurrent and voltage using a DSSCs evaluation system PSL-100 (EKO Co. Ltd.). A laser (λ = 640 nm) was used as a light source. The transients were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity which was controlled by adjusting its voltage. The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. Through varying the laser intensity, the lifetime could be estimated over a range of open-circuit voltages by fitting a decay of the photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τ). The electron density measurement was performed in the following method: the DSSCs was illuminated for 5 s while a bias voltage was applied to make the cell to be open-circuited, then the laser was shut down, while simultaneously, the cell was switched from open to short circuit. The resulting current was measured in 25 s and then the electron density could be calculated through integrating the quantity of electric charge. All experiments were conducted at room temperature.


The carbazole unit is well-known for its ease of oxidation of the nitrogen center and the ability to transport charge carriers via the radical cation species with high stability. It is widely investigated and applied in various electro-optical materials such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and non-linear materials. In recent years, it was found that the excellent photoelectric function of carbazole unit was desirable for organic sensitizers, and a substantial number of dyes with carbazole as electron donor were developed for organic solar cells. A fluorene group was also utilized in some organic sensitizers, but without the nitrogen atom in the molecule, its electron-donating ability is much weaker than carbazole. Here we incorporated three different units (carbazole, fluorene and 4-methylphenyl groups) with different degrees of electron-donating capability into the indoline section, thus constructing a D–D–π–A system and giving a systematic view of the absorption evolution. The synthetic routes for the corresponding sensitizers (C-CA and F-CA) are shown in Scheme S1. The planarity of both carbazole and fluorene segments is favorable to the delocalization and transfer of π conjugated electrons. The long n-pentyl group is also introduced into both carbazole and fluorene segments. The typical cyanoacetic acid is used as acceptor group, and vinyl thiophene segment is employed to provide conjugation bridge between donor and acceptor groups. As the product of Wittig reaction, the intermediates of 3 and 3′ were obtained as a mixture of trans- and cis-isomer, which possessed similar polarities and were difficult to separate. However, after formylation, the differences in polarities of two isomers were increased thus easily isolating the trans-isomer through common column chromatography over silica gel with petroleum ether–ethyl acetate mixture. The characteristic coupling in the 1H NMR spectra (J = 16.0 Hz) is indicative of the predominant trans-isomer. After recrystallized in dichloromethane (DCM)–petroleum ether, the target sensitizers were obtained as fine dark red/purple solid with acceptable yields, which were well characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HR-MS.



Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of the dyes in solution. Absorption peaks for C-CA, F-CA and I-3 are 523, 504, and 491 nm, respectively. Compared with the reference dye I-3 containing 4-methylphenyl group, the λmax of C-CA and F-CA is red-shifted by about 32 and 13 nm, respectively. Moreover, there is around 25% enhancement for C-CA and F-CA in molar extinction coefficient with respect to I-3 (Table 1). Apparently, in C-CA and F-CA containing carbazole and fluorene units, the introduction of additional donor (D–D moieties) with large π conjugation into indoline unit is helpful to both red-shifting in absorption spectra and enhancing molar extinction coefficient. As a consequence, the three different units with different degree in electron-donating capability into indoline section can give an exact evolution to the absorption in the D–D–π–A system.

While adsorbed on TiO2, significant π-aggregation occurred on the electrode surface. Taking C-CA as an example, absorption spectra in CHCl3, on 4 μm TiO2 electrode with 0 and 30 mM DCA were measured and shown in Fig. S1. Without DCA, the λmax was presented at 477 nm, which was blue-shifted by 46 nm with respect to that in CHCl3 (523 nm). In general, such a large blue-shift means the possible aggregation took placed on TiO2 surface, which also broadened the absorption spectrum obviously. While co-adsorbed with 30 mM DCA, the λmax was red-shifted by 14 nm from 477 to 491 nm, and the spectrum was narrowed at the same time. Apparently, these changes were caused by the prevention of aggregation by co-adsorbing with DCA. Therefore, to study the photophysical properties of dye-loaded TiO2 electrode without affects of π-aggregation, the followed measurements were performed using 30 mM DCA as co-adsorbent.
As shown in Fig. 1b, all these dyes exhibit blue-shift to different extents. Given that DCA (30 mM) can block the aggregation, here the observed blue-shift of λmax may be predominated by deprotonation effect. In contrast, the onset wavelengths of these dyes are red-shifted to longer than 700 nm especially for C-CA, in which λonset is found at 763 nm. Moreover, it is a remarkable fact that while adsorbed on thicker TiO2 electrodes (12 μm, Fig. 1c), the absorption of all these dyes are further broadened. That means, even the existing of the DCA (30 mM), there is still some J-aggregation on the surface of thicker TiO2 film, which is consistent with other reports. Actually, the broadening of the absorption spectra upon using a thicker TiO2 electrode is obviously favorable for the photoresponse. Taking C-CA for example, there is an obvious absorption plateau from 400 to 600 nm while the λonset is red-shifted to about 850 nm. Due to the weaker electron-donating abilities of donors containing fluorene and 4-methylphenyl units in F-CA and I-3, their absorption plateaus are narrower than C-CA. Also, the λonset for C-CA (850 nm, Table 1) is longer than F-CA and I-3 (815 and 775 nm, respectively). Accordingly, the introduction of carbazole group as additional donor can expand the absorption spectrum of C-CA to NIR region successfully, which is highly beneficial to harvest the light energy in visible region as well as even in part of NIR region.
However, the broad absorption spectrum is not favorable to conversion efficiency all the time, because it also brings narrow band gap between HOMO and LUMO levels. Exactly, the band gap of C-CA is lower than 2.00 V and estimated to be 1.94 V (Table 2). Narrow band gap may lead the LUMO level to be more positive, which can greatly influence the exited electron injection efficiency. Thus, cyclic voltammograms were performed to evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and regeneration of oxidized sensitizers. HOMO levels of three dyes were determined to be 0.83, 0.98 and 1.04 V (Table 2) vs. NHE, respectively, and lay in the order C-CA < F-CA < I-3. Among them, C-CA gives the most negative value, meaning that C-CA is much easier to give electrons than the other two dyes, due to the higher electron-donating ability of the carbazole group. LUMO levels of all three dyes are more negative than −1.00 V vs. NHE, and also lay in the order C-CA < F-CA < I-3. The conduction band of TiO2 is about −0.5 V vs. NHE. Generally, a minimal driving force of 0.2 V is sufficient to ensure fast excited-state injection and regeneration of the oxidized dye. Thus, the excited electrons injection of all three dyes are guaranteed to be efficient as well as the regeneration of the oxidized dyes.

To gain insight into the electronic properties of the dyes, density functional calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 03 program package at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. It is clearly seen from Fig. 2 that the electron of HOMO orbital is delocalized over the whole molecule while the LUMO orbital is mainly localized at the acceptor moiety, suggesting that after being illuminated by the light the excited electrons could be successively transferred to acceptor part and then injected into the conduction band of TiO2. TDDFT calculation (Table S1) shows the lowest transition of charge transfer character from donor moiety to the acceptor part, which is favorable for the charge injection. The overestimates of the lowest transition energies for the dyes might be related to the more extended charge-transfer nature of the electron transitions. The screening strategy helps us to optimize the TiO2-sensitier-redox electrolyte system in terms of the balance between spectral response, driving forces, and photovoltaic performance for future designing high efficiency dyes with suitable donor and acceptor groups in D–π–A system.

Using the 12 μm TiO2 film with 4 μm scattering layer as the photocathode, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and current–voltage curves of DSSCs based on C-CA and F-CA have been evaluated. Measurements have also been performed on DSSC based on the reference dye I-3 under the same conditions.

Due to the narrow absorption and low molar extinction coefficient, I-3 sensitized solar cell gives a relatively narrow IPCE action spectrum with low values (Fig. 3). The maximum value was obtained as 76% at 480 nm. In contrast, the values of C-CA and F-CA were increased as a result of higher molar extinction coefficient. The onset wavelengths in IPCE action spectra for these two dyes are all at around 780 nm. In good agreement with absorption spectra (Fig. 1c), owing to the higher electron-donating ability of carbazole, the IPCE action spectrum of C-CA is much broader than those of F-CA and I-3 (Fig. 3). Remarkably, the IPCE action spectrum of C-CA keeps an extraordinarily high plateau in visible region until around 700 nm, and the onset wavelength extends from 780 to about 860 nm in NIR region along with the increase of electron-donating ability of donor. Although the absorption wavelength longer than 800 nm is very low, there is still photoresponse in this area, and the onset wavelength in IPCE spectrum even exhibits about 10 nm red-shift owing to the scattering effect. Considering the absorption and reflection of the FTO glass, C-CA presents nearly unity IPCE values from 430 nm to 580 nm (around 80%), guaranteeing that high short-circuit current density could be generated.
30 mM DCA was used as coadsorbent material in above IPCE measurements which would improve photovoltaic performance significantly due to its prevention of π-aggregation on TiO2 surface. To work out how DCA worked in our system, we have compared the performance of DSSCs sensitized by C-CA with and without DCA (Fig. 4). Upon coadsorption with DCA, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is greatly increased from 14.16 to 18.53 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b), which is consistent with the enhancement of IPCE plateau from 60% to around 80%. Besides the Jsc, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is also slightly increased from 628 to 649 mV while the dark current onset potential increases from around 465 to 540 mV. The shift of dark current onset potential means that the charge recombination is retarded after adding DCA.
It is well known that the incorporation of a long alkyl chain can prevent dye aggregation effectively. But in the case of C-CA, the enhancement in Jsc upon coadsorption with DCA suggests that the long alkyl chain doesn't work well in preventing aggregation. In order to figure out how this happens, the optimized geometry of C-CA (front view and side view) was calculated as an example (B3LYP with 6-31G* basis in Gaussian 03 program). Considering its bidentate binding mode, the orientation of dye molecules upon anchoring on to the TiO2 was simulated. Generally, the π-aggregation is caused by the large and planar π-conjugated structure. In C-CA, the dihedral angle between n-pentyl substituted carbazole and neighboring indoline was calculated to be a relatively large value of 58.0° (Fig. S3).
Moreover, taking the twist structure of five-membered rings in indoline group into consideration, the π-aggregation should be prevented effectively in donor part. However, the π-linker bridge (vinyl thiophene) possesses very good coplanarity which can be seen clearly in side view (Fig. S3). Thus, a serious aggregation might take place. As a consequence, the introduction of an n-pentyl group in the donor part of carbazole and the fluorene unit has little effect on preventing the molecular π-aggregation. The similar phenomenon was also observed in some triphenylamine sensitizers. This might be the reason that the sharp increase in Jsc can be realized by adding coadsorbent DCA while blocking the possible π-aggregation. Apparently, the most effective way to prevent π-aggregation is still the introduction of long alkyl groups into the planar π-linker segment.
To further investigate the relationship between coadsorption of DCA and photovoltaic performance, the Voc and electron lifetime as a function of electron density based on C-CA sensitized DSSCs with and without DCA were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurement. Light intensity was adjusted by changing the bias voltage of the light source. The electron density was indirectly adjusted by verifying the intensity of bias light impinging on the cell. It is well known that the Voc is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the potential of the redox couple (I−/I3− in this work) in electrolyte. The quasi-Fermi level is dependent on both the conduction band edge position of TiO2 and the electron concentration in TiO2. The electron concentration is strongly dependent on the rate of electron recombination often referred to as the electron lifetime.Fig. 5a shows the relation between Voc and electron density. While illuminating solar cells with same light intensity, the electron density was sharply increased by almost 120% from 9.42 × 1018 cm−3 to 20.65 × 1018 cm−3 for without and with DCA, respectively. That means, upon coadsorption with DCA, there is a large enhancement in current density on account of preventing π-aggregation effect by DCA.
At a given electron density, a slight decrease in Voc was also found in DSSCs based on C-CA with DCA, which means, after coadsorption with DCA, the CB of TiO2 was slightly shifted to a more positive potential. The positive shift will go against high photovoltaic performance. To explain the Voc enhancement of solar cell with DCA, electron lifetime was subsequently measured to present the influence on the electron recombination rate. Also at a given electron density, the electron lifetime of C-CA with DCA is about 8 times as long as that of C-CA without DCA (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the recombination reaction between electrons in the CB of TiO2 and the redox electrolyte has been efficiently prevented. A plausible explanation of this observation is that the coadsorption with DCA can modify the surface of TiO2, resulting in less recombination and longer electron lifetimes. Therefore, the addition of DCA can make the CB of TiO2 slightly shift to a more positive potential and decrease the Voc, but meanwhile the electron recombination is inhibited effectively, resulting in an efficient electron injection into the CB of TiO2. Based on an overall consideration of the two factors, a 21 mV enhancement in photovoltage mentioned above between DSSCs based on C-CA with and without DCA can be easily understood.

I–V curves of DSSCs based on three dyes with 30 mM DCA are shown in Fig. 6 and summarized in Table 3. With the IPCE action spectrum was optimized step by step, the Jsc was increased from 11.63 (I-3) to 15.29 mA cm−2 (F-CA), and finally increased to 18.53 mA cm−2 (C-CA). There is 59% enhancement in Jsc of C-CA with respect to I-3. Obviously, this enhancement benefits from the broad and high IPCE action area, which is attributed to the introduction of carbazole group with high electron-donating ability through the successful molecular engineering. As expected, the introduction of an additional donor, especially with strong electron-donating ability, could indeed improve Jsc.

Besides Jsc, there are also some differences in Voc among DSSCs sensitized by three dyes. To understand the relationship between chemical structure and photovoltaic performance, the same measurements as in the investigation of the relationship between coadsorption of DCA and Voc were performed. In Fig. 7a, while illuminated solar cells with same intensity, the electron densities lay in the order C-CA > F-CA > I-3, in consistent with their corresponding Jsc. Also, it can be found that for all DSSCs based on C-CA, F-CA and I-3, the Voc increases linearly with the logarithm of electron density. Two curves of DSSCs based on C-CA and I-3 have the similar slope and coincide with each other. At a given electron density, the almost same Voc for these two DSSCs indicates the identical conduction band position for two cases. In the case of F-CA, a slightly lower Voc was observed at a given electron density, suggesting that the CB of TiO2 sensitized by F-CA is a little more positive than the other two dyes. Therefore, the conduction band edge is not influenced so much when the long alkyl segment is introduced into donor group. Then, the differences of Voc should be attributed to the repression of charge recombination, which is related to electron lifetime. As shown in Fig. 7b, the electron lifetime decreases with charge density following a power law relation with the same slope, suggesting the same recombination mechanism. At a given electron density, the electron lifetimes for DSSCs based on C-CA and F-CA is much longer than that of I-3. Just as expected, the charge recombination between electrons in CB of TiO2 and I3− ions is prevented effectively by introducing the long alkyl group, although it did not work well in preventing π-aggregation. Thus, as an overall result of CB shift and electron recombination prevention with the incorporated long alkyl groups in donor part, the Voc of DSSCs sensitized by three dyes lay in the order C-CA > I-3 > F-CA.

In summary, three different units (carbazole, fluorene and 4-methylphenyl groups) with different degrees of electron-donating capability are introduced into indoline donor section to form a donor–donor structure (D–D moiety). By incorporating the D–D moiety with vinyl thiophene and cyanoacetic acid, the D–D–π–A featured system (C-CA, F-CA and I-3) is constructed with a systematic view in the absorption evolution. Through molecular engineering, their light-harvesting capabilities, energy levels and photovoltaic performances were well optimized. Utilizing the strong electron-donating carbazole unit as additional donor, the absorption of sensitizer C-CA is successfully broadened to NIR region on the premise of suitable LUMO level. The introduction of n-pentyl group in donor part has little effect on preventing the molecular π-aggregation due to the good co-planarity in π-linker (vinyl thiophene), thus, coadsorbent deoxycholic acid (DCA) is necessary to break the aggregation. However, although it doesn't work well in preventing π-aggregation, the introducing long alkyl group can effectively prevent the electron recombination between electrons in conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and I3− ions. Along with the preferable light-harvesting capability, C-CA presents excellent IPCE performance with a Jsc of 18.53 mA cm−2, a Voc of 649 mV, an ff of 0.71, corresponding to a η of 8.49%. It provides an insight into developing high efficient organic sensitizers working in whole visible region with high photovoltaic performance.
