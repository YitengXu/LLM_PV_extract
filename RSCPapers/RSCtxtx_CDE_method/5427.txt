Janus monolayers, realized by breaking the vertical structural symmetry of two-dimensional (2D) materials, pave the way for a new era of high-quality and high-performance atomically-thin vertical p–n heterojunction solar cells. Herein, employing first-principles computations, Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers, MX, M2XY, MM′X2 and MM′XY (M, M′ = Ga, In; X, Y = S, Se, Te), are deeply investigated in view of their implementation in 2D photovoltaic systems. Their stability analysis reveals that the 21 investigated monolayers are energetically, thermodynamically, mechanically, dynamically, and thermally stable, confirming their growth feasibility under ambient conditions. Furthermore, owing to their optimal band gap, high charge carrier mobilities, and strong light absorption, 2D Janus group-III monolayers are predicted as promising candidates for 2D excitonic solar cell applications. In fact, 46 type-II van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with a lattice mismatch of less than 5% are identified by analyzing the band alignments of the investigated monolayers obtained through the HSE + SOC approach. In particular, 7 vertical vdW heterojunctions with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 20% are predicted and might be the focus of future experimental and theoretical studies. To further confirm the type II band alignment, the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure, which reveals the highest PCE of 23.69%, is thoroughly investigated. Our results not only predict and evaluate stable 2D Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers and vdW heterostructures, but also suggest that they could be used as materials for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

The successful exfoliation of two-dimensional (2D) materials with unusual physical properties has raised worldwide interest, particularly because of their potential implementation in advanced optoelectronic devices. In this context, the 2D group-III monochalcogenide family has also attracted the attention of scientists due to their remarkable mechanical, thermal, electronic, and optical properties. To date, monolayers of GaS, GaSe, GaTe, and InSe have been grown, while some of their unique features, such as the high electron mobility (∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1), the high thermal stability (up to 660 °C), and the absence of dangling bonds, have been characterized. Moreover, the highly anisotropic structural, mechanical, and electrical features, the good Ohmic contact, the high on/off ratio (∼108), and the strong ultraviolet-visible light absorption make group-III monochalcogenide monolayers promising for ultrafast nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. In addition, several theoretical studies have investigated their physical properties and their potential applications in optoelectronic devices and in photocatalytic water splitting technology.

Recently, alongside ongoing efforts to investigate novel 2D systems, a new pathway has been discovered after the successful experimental synthesis of Janus monolayers with broken mirror symmetry and inherent out-of-plane polarization. Indeed, the production of Janus MoSSe monolayers by replacing one layer of S(Se) atoms in MoS2 (MoSe2) nanosheets with Se(S) atoms has been reported. This success has been followed by a series of studies on Janus structures, such as WSSe, PtSSe, and BiTeCl. Particularly, 2D Janus materials allow for large piezoelectricity, a giant Rashba effect, and valley polarization, making them immensely promising for futuristic applications in energy harvesting, nanopiezotronic field-effect transistors photocatalytic water splitting, and spintronics. In fact, the future of 2D Janus materials is anticipated to be promising, with numerous expected applications in nanotechnology. The study of 2D Janus structures is not restricted to transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), but also involves group-III monochalcogenide nanosheets. Regarding the latter, first-principles calculations have indicated that single-layer Janus M2XY monolayers (M = Ga, In; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X ≠ Y) are semiconductors and can be widely used in a variety of applications, including piezoelectricity and photocatalytic water splitting. These investigations demonstrated that inducing mirror symmetry breaking in Janus structures through the inclusion of a third element would result in novel and more fascinating quantum phenomena such as large Rashba splitting, skyrmionics, and excitonics with broad application prospects. More recently, a new class of Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers, MM′X2 and MM′XY (M, M′ = Ga, In; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X ≠ Y), has been theoretically designed and proposed. The high dynamic stability, suitable bandgaps, strong visible light absorption, excellent spatial separation of charge carriers, and rapid transfer of photogenerated carriers all make 2D Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers ideal candidates for photovoltaic applications.
With the research progress on 2D materials’ development and production, the concept of constituting van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions by vertically stacking distinct single-layered 2D nanomaterials together through the interlayer vdW interaction opens the way for new promising applications. In fact, numerous type-II heterostructure solar cells (i.e., excitonic solar cells) have been predicted or synthesized, including graphene/MoS2, MoS2/MoSe2, Te/TMDs, and BAs/InTe. Such heterojunctions exhibit remarkable thermal stability under ambient conditions owing to their strong intralayer covalent bonding, whereas comparatively weak interlayer vdW interactions retain them layered together while maintaining their own intrinsic optoelectronic features. Moreover, in vertical vdW heterojunctions with a type-II band alignment, the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are localized in distinct layers, namely, donor and acceptor semiconductors. Hence, photogenerated charge carriers are spatially separated into distinct layers, which helps to decrease the e–h recombination rate and negate the doping requirement (e.g., electrostatic, chemical, or elemental). This makes type-II vdW heterostructures beneficial for photoenergy harvesting. However, it is worthwhile to underline that only a few 2D materials exhibit optoelectronic characteristics necessary for excitonic solar cells. It is then necessary to use computational screening to identify type-II vertical vdW heterostructures with potential for applications in such optoelectronic devices.
Herein, we first evaluated the energetic, dynamic, mechanical, and thermal stabilities of 21 monolayers of general formula MX, M2XY, MM′X2 and MM′XY (M, M′ = Ga, In; X, Y = S, Se, Te), and further investigated their electronic, transport, and optical properties using first-principles calculations. Next, the band diagrams of the considered monolayers are aligned with respect to the vacuum level, from which 46 vdW heterostructures exhibiting type-II band alignment and possessing a lattice mismatch of less than 5% were identified. In addition, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the 46 type-II vdW heterostructures was evaluated. Finally, we thoroughly analyzed the vdW heterostructure exhibiting the highest PCE to further confirm the type-II band alignment. This research presents a comprehensive method for the analysis of group-III chalcogenide monolayers and vdW heterostructures and provides insight into their potential in nanoelectronics and sustainable energy applications.

In this work, first-principles computations within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT) were performed as implemented in the Quantum Espresso code. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism was employed to describe the exchange–correlation potential. The empirical DFT-D2 correction proposed by Grimme was applied to take into account the effect of the long-range weak vdW interactions. The electron–ion interactions were described using norm-conserving pseudopotentials. A plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 80 Ry was considered. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Γ-centered 21 × 21 × 1 k-point mesh according to the Monkhorst–Pack scheme. A vacuum space of 30 Å along the perpendicular direction to the 2D surface was considered to avoid interactions between neighboring slabs. In addition, due to the creation of an intrinsic dipole moment in Janus structures, a dipole correction suggested by Bengtsson was considered in all calculations. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) was included in the self-consistent calculations of electronic and optical properties. For geometry optimization, all ionic coordinates and lattice constants were allowed to relax until the Hellmann–Feynman forces on atoms were smaller than 10−3 eV Å−1 and the energy difference between two consecutive steps was less than 10−5 eV. Additionally, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhorf (HSE) hybrid functional of the generalized Kohn–Sham scheme was employed on top of the GGA to obtain a more accurate electronic structure. The mixing parameter and the range-separation parameter were set to 0.25 and 0.2 Å−1, respectively. The Bader charge technique was utilized to analyze the charge transfer within the structures.

To assess the stability of the studied nanomaterials, the dynamic stability was first investigated through phonon calculations using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method. Next, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in the canonical ensemble (NVT) were performed for a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell to check the thermal stability at room temperature for 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs. A Nosé thermostat was used to control the temperature. We preferred to employ ensemble dynamics in the NVT (constant number of particles, constant volume, and constant temperature) with Nosé–Hoover-type thermostats over that in the NPT (constant number of particles, constant pressure, and constant temperature) since the former is widely used in cases involving 2D materials. Furthermore, the differences between NPT and NVT simulations are usually quite small at the considered temperature, while they are more apparent at higher temperatures. Finally, the Thermo-PW package was used to determine the elastic constants (Cij) and to further test the mechanical stability.

We initially examined the crystal structure of group-III monochalcogenide MX (M = Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te) monolayers. The geometry of the binary MX systems belongs to the D3h symmetry group with mirror symmetry in the z-direction, as shown in Fig. 1. Strong covalent bonds hold the four sublayers (X–M–M–X) together. Next, a total of fifteen Janus structures categorized into three groups were constructed: M2XY, MM′X2, and MM′XY (M, M′ = Ga, In; X, Y = S, Se, Te). First, the Janus M2XY monolayers can be built from the MX monolayers by replacing one layer of X atoms with another layer of Y atoms. Similarly, the Janus MM′X2 monolayers can be constructed by substituting one layer of M atoms in MX nanosheets with M′ atoms. The Janus MM′XY monolayer is made up of two layers of metal (M and M′) in between two layers of chalcogen (X and Y). The atomic structures of all studied monolayers are presented in Fig. 1. In contrast to the binary MX monolayers, the mirror symmetry in the out-of-plane direction is broken in the Janus structures. This gives them vertical electric dipoles and makes them part of the C3v point group.

After full geometric relaxation, the optimized structural parameters, which are the lattice constants (a), the bond lengths between M–X (dM−X), M′–Y (dM′−Y), and M–M′ (dM−M′) atoms, and the thicknesses (h) of the studied monolayers, are summarized in Table S1. Since the obtained lattice parameters, bond lengths, and thicknesses of group-III monochalcogenide monolayers are consistent with early investigations, we mainly used DFT-D2 in our computations, which could provide a good description of the long-range vdW interactions of 2D materials. Our obtained results demonstrate that the lattice parameters of the Janus monolayers lie between the values of their binary analogs. For example, the calculated lattice parameter of GaInSSe (a = 3.74 Å) lies between those of GaS (a = 3.57 Å) and InSe (a = 3.93 Å). Moreover, it is found that the lattice constants, the dM−X and dM′−Y bond lengths, and the thicknesses of the MX and MM′X2 structures increase with an increase in the size of the X element (i.e., S → Se → Te). For the M2XY and MM′XY monolayers, the previously mentioned structural properties increase as the sum of the atomic radii of X and Y increases (i.e., SSe → STe → SeTe). Meanwhile, the dM−M′ bond lengths in the Janus MM′X2 and MM′XY monolayers remain particularly unchanged, being similar to Ga–Ga and In–In bond lengths in monochalcogenides MX and Janus M2XY monolayers. This suggests that the bonding between M and M′ atoms remains the same. The obtained structural properties of the studied monolayers are in good agreement with previously reported results.
To assess the energetic stability of the studied monolayers, we calculated their cohesive energy Ecoh (for details, please see Text S2). From Table S2, the cohesive energy decreases down to the chalcogen group (and/or moving across a period) in parallel with the elongation of bond lengths, indicating the weakening of the bonds. Furthermore, our results indicate that the most energetically stable structure is the GaS monolayer (Ecoh = 3.61 eV per atom), and the InTe monolayer is the least stable (Ecoh = 2.76 eV per atom). In addition, our obtained results demonstrate that the cohesive energies of the investigated Janus monolayers lie between the values of their binary constituents. Thus, the formation of the studied Janus monolayers is energetically favorable. Furthermore, to check the thermodynamic stability of the studied monolayers, we calculated the heat of formation (ΔH) and the energy above the convex hull (ΔHhull) (for details, please see Text S2). The high thermodynamic stability requires ΔH < 0 eV per atom and ΔHhull < 0.2 eV per atom. As shown in Table S2, the calculated ΔH and ΔHhull of all investigated monolayers can meet the high thermodynamic stability criterion. Therefore, the studied monolayers are thermodynamically stable and are potentially synthesizable 2D materials.
For the studied monolayers, the Bader charge analysis listed in Table S3 indicates that charge donation occurs from metal (M and M′) atoms to chalcogenide (X and Y) atoms. For example, it is found that for the Janus InGaSeTe monolayer, Ga and In atoms lose 0.402e and 0.756e, while the Se and Te atoms receive 0.708e and 0.450e, respectively. This is mainly attributed to the fact that chalcogenide atoms are more electronegative than Ga and In atoms. Therefore, chalcogenide atoms attract electrons from around the metal atoms toward the bonding region that lies between them. Moreover, the amount of charge acquired by the S atoms is larger than that received by the other chalcogenide atoms since the charge transfer relies on the difference in electronegativity between the metal and the chalcogenide atoms, which decreases as moving down in the chalcogen group (i.e., S → Se → Te). Also, increasing (decreasing) the Bader charge transfer between the metal and chalcogenide atoms strengthens (weakens) the covalent bonds, resulting in a decrease (increase) in the bond length. The induced mirror symmetry breaking in Janus structures leads to the creation of intrinsic electric dipoles pointing from the Y atom to the X atom in the Janus M2XY and MM′XY monolayers, and from the M atom to the M′ atom in the Janus MM′X2 monolayers, as shown in Fig. 1. The plane-averaged electrostatic potential of all studied monolayers is presented in Fig. S1–S4. The potential energy difference (ΔΦ) and dipole moments (P) are listed in Table S1. It is evident that MM′STe has the largest ΔΦ due to the large electronegativity difference between the S and Te atoms. Furthermore, the obtained results for GaInXY and InGaXY are very different, indicating that the relative positions of the metal and chalcogen atoms have noticeable effects on them. These findings reveal that the Janus InGaSTe monolayer has more asymmetry than the other studied monolayers, thus facilitating the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. The obtained dipole moments for the studied Janus structures (0.03–0.26 Debye) are comparable to those of other polar nanomaterials, such as Janus TMDs (0.17–0.38 Debye), III2–VI3 monolayers (0.45–0.61 Debye), and germanium monochalcogenides (0.16–0.21 Debye).
Following the geometric optimization, the dynamic stability of the studied monolayers was evaluated through the calculation of the corresponding phonon band structures along the high symmetry directions. The considered primitive unit cell is composed of four atoms, which give rise to twelve phonon branches, as shown in Fig. S5–S8. Three phonon modes in the low energy region are acoustic, while the other nine phonon modes in the high energy region are optical. It can be clearly seen that there are no imaginary-frequency modes throughout the entire Brillouin zone in the phonon spectral diagrams, suggesting that the studied single layers are dynamically stable. Moreover, a decrease in the optical branch frequency is observed as moving down in the chalcogen group, which is due to the increase in the atomic mass of the chalcogen atoms. Additionally, the thermal stability of the studied nanomaterials under ambient conditions was verified using AIMD simulations. The time-dependent temperature and relative energy fluctuations as well as the consequent atomic structures after 5 ps are shown in Fig. S9–S12. Our simulations demonstrate that the geometries of the studied monolayers are still robust even after 5 ps of heating. Also, no significant distortion is noticed in the atomic structures of all the considered monolayers. Furthermore, the structures at the end of the AIMD simulations show no structural transitions, and no bond breaking at room temperature. Therefore, we can conclude that all the studied monolayers are thermally stable at room temperature.
After checking the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the examined nanosheets, their mechanical characteristics were investigated by determining the elastic constants (Cij) tensor. Due to the hexagonal symmetry of the studied monolayers, only the values of C11 (= C22), C12, and C66 are relevant. From Table S4, we can see that all of the Cij values are positive, demonstrating that the considered monolayers meet the Born–Huang stability criterion and are mechanically stable. The Young modulus (γ), Poisson's ratio (ν), 2D layer modulus (γ2D), intrinsic strength (σint), and bending modulus (D) were further determined and are listed in Table S4 (for details, please see the ESI). In conjunction with lattice parameter elongation and subsequently bond lengths, it was revealed that γ decreases when the atomic number of chalcogen atoms increases. Therefore, GaS can be classified in the category of stiffest monolayers with respect to the studied nanostructures. Furthermore, similarly to their structural properties, the γ of Janus monolayers lies between that of their binary counterparts. On the other hand, according to the Frantsevich criteria, it can be concluded that the studied nanosheets are brittle since ν < 1/3. However, when compared to the well-known flexible monolayers like graphene (ν = 0.173) and h-BN (ν = 0.22), the here studied nanostructures exhibit larger ν values, indicating their potential use in flexible nanodevices. To sum up, cohesive energy, heat of formation, energy above the convex hull, phonon computations, AIMD simulations, and elastic constant calculations indicate that the studied monolayers are energetically, thermodynamically, dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, confirming their possible experimental synthesis as freestanding single layers at room temperature.
The electronic band structures of the 21 studied monolayers calculated along the high symmetry points of Γ–M–K–Γ through the HSE approach are presented in Fig. S13–S16. Although they exhibit different semiconducting characteristics in their bulk forms, MX single layers are indirect band gap semiconductors, having band gaps ranging from 2.34 to 3.47 eV (see Table S1). Apart from band gap values, the main difference seems to be in the position of their VBM and CBM points. Except for the InTe monolayer, where the VBM is located at the Γ-point, the VBM lies between the K- and Γ-points for all other studied MX monolayers. On the other hand, the CBM resides at the Γ-point for GaSe, InS, and InSe monolayers and at the M-point for GaS, GaTe, and InTe single layers. It should be noted that the valence band edge located between Γ- and M-points differs only by 1–5 meV from the VBM point of the MX monolayers. In fact, a ring-shaped valence band edge resulting from a Mexican-hat dispersion around the Γ-point is observed, which can result in novel phenomena such as the van Hove singularity in the density of states. The Janus M2XY monolayers exhibit band gaps ranging from 1.41 to 3.29 eV. Moreover, except for Ga2SSe, the other M2XY monolayers become direct band gap semiconductors. For the MM′X2 monolayers, a semiconducting feature is shown with band gaps comprised between 1.97 and 3.13 eV. The GaInS2 and GaInTe2 monolayers are still indirect band gap semiconductors, while the GaInSe2 monolayer becomes a direct band gap semiconductor. Furthermore, the Janus MM′XY nanosheets still preserve the semiconducting character, with band gaps varying from 0.53 to 3.04 eV. The obtained results show that the GaInSSe, GaInSTe, GaInSeTe, and InGaSTe monolayers exhibit direct gaps with their VBM and CBM points located at the Γ-point, while the InGaSSe and InGaSeTe monolayers are indirect band gap semiconductors. The corresponding bandgap values of M2XY, MM′X2, and MM′XY summarized in Table S1 are consistent with those reported in previous works. In summary, although the binary MX analogs are indirect semiconductors, direct band gap behavior occurs in the electronic structure of some of the ternary Janus monolayers. Additionally, it is observed that the band gap decreases as the X element's size increases (i.e., S → Se → Te) in MX and MM′X2 monolayers, while it decreases as the difference in the atomic radius between X and Y atoms increases (i.e., SSe → SeTe → STe) in M2XY and MM′XY monolayers. This means that the band gaps of MX can be modified by constructing Janus nanostructures, which enables us to tailor the optoelectronic properties of 2D materials.
It is acknowledged that the spin–orbital coupling (SOC) plays a crucial role in the modification of the optoelectronic characteristics of 2D materials, especially those containing heavy elements. The calculated band structures of MX, M2XY, MM′X2, and MM′XY monolayers through the HSE + SOC method are shown in Fig. S17–S20. Our findings indicate that while GaS and InS retain their band gap values, the inclusion of SOC slightly reduces the band gap of the other studied monolayers (please see Table S1). In addition, the SOC has a minor effect on the band structures of the here investigated monolayers. In fact, the presence of the SOC eliminates the degeneracy of the VBM states, resulting in minor changes concerning the energy dispersion around the Γ-point, whereas the electronic states of the CBM are slightly affected. Furthermore, a small spin–orbit splitting energy is detected close to the Γ-point in the valence band due to the SOC, which is highly dependent on the constituent element's size.
The energy conversion efficiency of photovoltaic materials is significantly affected by their ability to absorb light. Here, the absorption coefficient of investigated monolayers is evaluated based on the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function derived using the HSE + SOC functional, as follows,
(1)
where
ε1 is the real part of the complex dielectric function, and ε2 represents the imaginary part. Fig. 2 depicts the optical absorption coefficients of the investigated monolayers as a function of photon energy for in-plane light polarization. As shown, all the studied monolayers show considerable visible light and near-ultraviolet absorption. The strong optical absorption of the investigated monolayers can be ascribed to the enhanced hybridization states near the VBM (p orbitals of M′ and Y atoms) and the CBM (s orbitals of M and X atoms), as such hybridization leads to the increased interband transition probabilities of electrons from the valence to the conduction bands. Meanwhile, the position of absorption edges and peaks is different due to the difference in band structures. Obviously, an increase in the band gap leads to a blue shift of the absorption edges/peaks. In the visible region, the absorption coefficients exceed 104 cm−1, which indicates a high solar energy efficiency. Furthermore, the obtained absorption coefficients are comparable to those previously reported for other 2D materials, such as Janus TMDs, PtSSe, and γ-BTe. This indicates that the investigated monolayers are suitable for use in optoelectronic devices.

High charge carrier mobility in solar cell materials facilitates the movement and separation of photogenerated e–h pairs, thus ensuring a high conversion efficiency. The mobility of charge carriers for the here studied monolayers may be approximated using the deformation potential model, which is expressed as,
(2)
where
e is the electron's charge, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, C2D is the elastic modulus (please see Table S4), kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature set to 300 K,  is the carrier effective mass,  is the average carrier effective mass, and  is the deformation potential constant, where Eedge represents the band edge energy of the CBM for electrons and the VBM for holes produced by infinitesimal uniaxial strain, ε, along the armchair and zigzag directions. The carrier mobilities were calculated using an orthorhombic lattice instead of a hexagonal lattice due to the anisotropy.

Tables S5 and S6 list the calculated carrier effective masses, the deformation potential constant, and the corresponding charge carrier mobilities along the x and y directions. It can be seen that the electron has a smaller effective mass than the hole and that the effective mass has a strong anisotropy. In contrast, the results of charge carrier mobility indicate that a lower effective mass does not correspond to a larger μ2D and that charge carrier mobility exhibits relatively strong anisotropic characteristics. The electron mobility of the here studied monolayers ranges from 115.01 to 5128.75 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the hole mobility is much lower, reaching only 40.44 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the InS monolayer. The highest hole mobility is obtained for InSe (349.17 cm2 V−1 s−1). According to a recent experimental study, the mobility of electrons in a few layers of InSe at room temperature is approximately 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high carrier mobility and anisotropic carrier mobility characteristics make group-III monolayers interesting for photovoltaic applications.
It is worth mentioning that the calculated mobilities constitute “order of magnitude” estimates of the real ones since the deformation potential theory only considers scattering on acoustic phonons and ignores scattering on optical phonons. Nonetheless, because it only requires a few parameters from the material's properties and is much more computationally efficient than the Boltzmann transport equation, such a model has been widely used to estimate carriers’ mobilities of 2D materials. Furthermore, even though the calculated mobilities are overestimated, the relative ordering of the mobilities for varying metal and/or chalcogenide elements can be correctly predicted by the employed equation. Therefore, comparisons of mobilities in different 2D materials are reliable. However, to overcome the limitations of the deformation potential theory and obtain more accurate intrinsic mobilities, the calculation of the electron–phonon coupling matrix element for each scattering process is required. Thus, the predicted promising Janus monolayers could be the subject of future theoretical and experimental studies focusing on their intrinsic transport properties.
The relative positions of the investigated monolayers’ valence and conduction bands are crucial in determining the type-II band alignment. The latter is of significant technological interest for photovoltaic applications since it permits the generation of spatially separated photogenerated charge carriers with extended carrier lifetimes. Our investigations demonstrate that the studied 2D materials’ energy levels can be aligned with regard to the vacuum level, as shown in Fig. 3, which depicts the resulting CBMs and VBMs obtained using the HSE + SOC functional. Among the many possible combinations, 46 vdW heterostructures were found to exhibit a type II alignment with a lattice mismatch of less than 5%.
Power conversion efficiency (PCE), which quantifies the proportion of solar energy that can be turned into electricity, is the most crucial metric of a solar cell's performance. Bernardi and Scharber have proposed an approach to calculate the upper limit on the PCE of an excitonic solar cell, in which the PCE is expressed as,
(3)
where
βFF = 0.65 is the fill factor, Voc represents the maximum open-circuit voltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current, Psolar is the total incident solar power per unit area, Edg is the donor band gap, ΔEc represents the conduction band offset (CBO) between the donor and the acceptor, and P(ħω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy (ħω). Such a model was initially developed for studying bulk excitonic solar cells, and it was later adopted for investigating 2D materials. Since then, it has been widely used to predict promising 2D materials for excitonic solar cells.

For 2D vdW heterostructure epitaxial growth, the minimal lattice mismatch between the donor and acceptor monolayers is a necessary condition, which can be approximated from the calculated lattice parameters of constituent monolayers as ε = (a2 − a1)/a2, with a2 > a1. The calculated lattice mismatch, donor bandgap, conduction band offset, and power conversion efficiency of the 46 identified type II vdW heterostructures having ε < 5% are summarized in Table 1. In Fig. 4, a 2D contour plot of the PCE for the identified vdW heterostructures is presented. Heterostructures with CBO > 0.8 eV, Edg < 0.5 eV, or Edg > 2.5 eV are not expected to achieve a high PCE and are, therefore, not depicted in the figure. However, 21 vdW heterostructures with a PCE greater than 15% were identified. In addition, 7 of them have PCEs exceeding 20%. Particularly, the PCEs of Ga2STe/GaInS2 (23.69%) and In2SeTe/InSe (23.54%) vdW heterostructures were found to be slightly higher than those of the predicted values of recently proposed β-PdTe2/WTe2 (23.14%), MoSeTe–WSeTe (22.99%), γ-BTe/GeP2 (22.95%), and Te/WTe2 (22.5%) excitonic solar cells. Nevertheless, lower efficiencies were obtained experimentally for 2D vertical p–n junctions composed of MoS2/WS2 (0.2%), GaTe/MoS2 (0.45%), ReS2/ReSe2 (0.48%), and WSe2/h-BN/graphene (4.1%). These indicate that there are still many obstacles to be overcome before the practical implementation of 2D materials in future photovoltaic devices.

It is noteworthy to remark that heterostructures with a PCE higher than 20% possess two common features. First, the band gap of the donor monolayers is in the range of 1.26–1.69 eV, which is commensurate with an optimal band gap of 1.0–1.7 eV for maximum light absorption in conventional single-crystal p–n junction solar cells. Indeed, an increase in Edg has a positive effect on Voc but a negative one on Jsc. Therefore, a too-small or too-large donor band gap is undesirable for 2D excitonic solar cell applications. Second, the CBO of these vdW heterostructures is as low as possible, resulting in a reduced energy loss and hence a high Voc. The combination of a donor monolayer with a band gap close to the ideal 1.4 eV band gap and an acceptor monolayer with the smallest possible band offset from the donor monolayer is suggested as a design role for 2D type II excitonic solar cells.
In the present study, the optical band gap is approximated by the electrical band gap determined using the HSE functional. This is primarily attributable to the high computational cost required to calculate excitonic effects, particularly in high-throughput screening. Nonetheless, despite the fact that the exciton-binding energy in 2D materials can be large, a recent study showed that it increases linearly with the band gap. This implies that substituting the optical band gap with the electrical one will have no effect on the relative positions of the band edges and, consequently, the band alignment. Thus, our calculations will be able to identify the right trends in the PCE of the heterostructure solar cells.
Furthermore, first-principles calculations were performed to analyze the Ga2STe–GaInS2 heterostructure, which was found to exhibit the highest PCE. To determine the most stable stacking and patterning configuration between Ga2STe and GaInS2 monolayers, six high-symmetry stacking sequences having four distinct interfacial patterns were examined, as shown in Fig. S21 and S22. The stability of these arrangements may be assessed after geometric optimization using the binding energy (Eb), expressed as follows,
Eb = Eheterostructure − Etop − Ebottom
(4)
where
Eheterostructure, Etop, and Ebottom denote the total energies of the vdW heterostructure, top monolayer, and bottom monolayer, respectively. Table S7 summarizes the calculated lattice parameter, interlayer distance, thickness, and binding energy of all the possible stacking and patterning configurations of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure. Among the six distinct stacking configurations, the one with the lowest binding energy is the AB stacking with a P3 interfacial pattern. We can notice that the Eb value ranges between −0.089 eV and −0.225 eV, indicating the presence of weak van der Waals interactions between monolayers in the constituted heterostructure. Fig. 5(a) depicts the optimized geometrical configuration of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure. Furthermore, the dynamic stability of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure was evaluated by calculating the phonon spectra, as presented in Fig. 5(b). Positive frequencies are observed for all branches throughout the entire Brillouin zone, indicating that the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure is dynamically stable.


Fig. 5(c) illustrates the calculated band structure of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure using HSE and HSE + SOC methods. Similarly to its constituent monolayers, the ground state configuration of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure is semiconducting, with a Γ-point direct band gap of 0.66 eV and 0.64 eV using HSE and HSE + SOC approaches, respectively. The inclusion of SOC has a minor effect on the band structure, as it slightly reduces the band gap of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure. In fact, the presence of the SOC eliminates the degeneracy of the VBM states, resulting in minor changes concerning the energy dispersion around the Γ-point, whereas the electronic states of the CBM are slightly affected. Furthermore, a small spin–orbit splitting energy is detected close to the Γ-point in the valence band due to the SOC. Table S7 also lists the band gaps for all stacking and patterning configurations. The P2 and P3 patterning configurations exhibit the largest and lowest band gaps, respectively. The band gap of the designed vdW heterostructure is smaller than that of the constituent monolayers, which is primarily due to the added vdW interaction between the layers. To confirm the band alignment of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterojunction, Fig. 5(d and e) present the band-decomposed charge densities at the CBM and VBM points. The VBM is primarily driven by the donor Ga2STe monolayer, while the acceptor GaInS2 monolayer is responsible for the CBM. In addition, upon creation of the heterostructure, charge transfer occurs as a result of the realignment of the Fermi level to achieve equilibrium, as depicted schematically in Fig. 5(f). Consequently, electrons will flow from the Ga2STe monolayer to the GaInS2 monolayer owing to the larger built-in electric field resulting from the higher electrostatic potential difference, as indicated in Table S7. Accordingly, electron accumulation and depletion will occur at GaInS2 and Ga2STe monolayers, respectively, as seen in the charge density difference and the planar-averaged charge density difference along the z-axis depicted in Fig. 5(g). Bader charge analysis confirms these findings by revealing a 0.023e charge transfer between Janus Ga2STe and Janus GaInS2 monolayers. Concerning the optical features of the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure, Fig. 5(h) illustrates the estimated optical absorption coefficients of the examined heterostructure and those of its component single-layers. As can be clearly seen, the optical absorption of the heterojunction in the ultraviolet area is markedly enhanced compared to that of the constituent monolayers, and the optical absorption can span the range from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet zone. These findings suggest that heterostructure formation would significantly improve the optical characteristics in the visible and ultraviolet light spectra of 2D nanostructures. The Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure forms a type-II p–n heterojunction and can create spatially separated photogenerated e−–h+ pairs with extended carrier lifetimes, which is of significant technical importance for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Our present work on Janus group-III heterostructures will definitely help both theorists and experimentalists in the development of enhanced 2D heterojunction solar cells and strengthen the prospects for the use of Janus group-III vdW heterostructures in photovoltaics.

To sum up, using first-principles computations, vdW heterostructures composed of Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers are shown to be promising candidates for 2D solar cell applications. Initially, the fundamental characteristics of 21 monolayers of the general formula MX, M2XY, MM′X2 and MM′XY (M, M′ = Ga, In; X, Y = S, Se, Te) were evaluated. The stability assessments reveal that the studied monolayers are energetically, thermodynamically, mechanically, dynamically, and thermally stable and can be experimentally synthesized. In addition, our findings suggest that the investigated monolayers are semiconducting with band gaps ranging from 3.47 eV to 0.20 eV. Furthermore, the intrinsic electric field, the high carrier mobilities, and the extended light absorption promote the absorption and separation of photoinduced e−–h+ pairs, which is essential for high photovoltaic performance. By aligning the energy levels of the studied monolayers with respect to the vacuum level, 46 type-II vdW heterostructures with a lattice mismatch of less than 5% are identified. In particular, 7 heterostructures were predicted to yield higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) that exceeded 20%, which could be the subject of future theoretical and experimental research. By deeply analyzing the Ga2STe–GaInS2 vdW heterostructure, which is predicted to yield the highest PCE of 23.69%, the type-II band alignment is further confirmed. Our findings not only forecast and assess stable 2D Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers but also recommend them as promising materials for 2D excitonic solar cell applications, narrowing the scope of the most promising vdW nanostructures for further experimental development and testing.
