Re-thinking our relationship with energy resources and environmental equilibrium, towards anthropogenic sustainability, calls for innovative and energetically wise technologies. Smart devices adjusting their optical behaviour depending on the environmental conditions will allow remarkable energy savings. To this end, photoelectrochromic devices (PECDs) have captured, in the last two decades, the interest of many research groups and industrial players worldwide. These devices encompass a dual behavior, being able to generate energy and, concomitantly, deliver a smart optical response. For this reason, they are the ideal skins of future buildings, capable of modulating their behavior in response to changing external stimuli, like sunlight irradiance. PECDs have a wide range of applications, from solar shading in architectural glazing to rear view mirrors in automotives, or avionics. This review article explores the different design concepts standing at the basis of the devices that have appeared so far, shedding light on future perspectives. This work takes into account R&D issues and processing constraints as well as the potential exploitation of emerging solid-state materials promising important technological progress.

The development of technologies allowing a reduction of the anthropogenic impact on planet resources and, concomitantly, improving people lifestyle is among the key scopes of applied research. The built environment accounts for more than 40% of the primary energy used in Europe and is responsible for 36% of its green-house gases outcome. This strong impact is mainly due to heating, cooling and lighting in residential and commercial buildings. If the thermo-physical performances of building envelopes could be dynamic, this impact could be greatly reduced. A photoelectrochromic device (PECD) is an ideal candidate for the task, since it is able to self-power a smart optical response allowing, if used as a window, variable energy throughputs. A PECD is a multifunctional object in which different components are brought together, to combine their properties in a resulting, innovative fashion. In particular, a first function consists in converting electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy (PV function) and a second one in varying the chromatic characteristics of the device itself, following an electric stimulus (EC function). In some cases, namely photovoltachromic devices (PVCDs), a surplus of electric energy can be generated, adding an extra feature to this class of multifunctional devices. The device being a complex combination of players, its evolution is based on the development of all the components and it can be accelerated by a breakthrough in one of the related fields. In the last few years such advancements have been witnessed, thus progress of PECDs is expected and is worth considering the development of their features and architectures and the interesting forthcoming perspectives.


Planet biosphere alteration, along with the progressive depletion of non-renewable energy sources, calls for innovative and non-polluting technologies devoted to energy management. The impact of human activities on the environment is, in fact, so strong that an ecologist, Eugene F. Stoermer, and successively a Nobel laureate for chemistry, Paul Crutzen, advise to re-name our epoch the “Anthropocene”. Among many indicators of the unsustainability of our interaction with the ecosystem is the rising of the atmosphere temperature, likely connected to anthropogenic activities. 2015 witnessed an unenviable record in this frame, as the global average surface temperature was the warmest on record reaching the symbolic and significant milestone of 1 °C above the pre-industrial era. The urge for a worldwide cooperative and conscientious utilization of natural resources brought to Paris, in December 2015, representatives of 196 countries, to agree upon worldwide responses to the current situation. The epochal event underlined the common consensus around the necessity of adopting a series of measurements aiming at reducing the risks and impacts of anthropogenic activities on a delicate planet equilibrium. These policies along with a technological maturation of relating technologies promote renewables as key players in the energy market share. The world total renewable energy investment in 2015 was the highest figure ever, of $328.9 bn, up 4% from 2014's $315.9 bn and beating the previous record, set in 2011 by 3%. This has contributed to a severe reduction of PV plant costs, and a recent report underlines how solar PV is already cheaper than grid electricity in 42 of the 50 largest US cities. In this epochal conundrum it is worth considering that the built environment accounts for more than 40% of the primary energy used in Europe and is responsible for 36% of green-house gases, according to the European Commission. This huge amount of energy consumption is mainly due to heating, cooling and lighting in residential and commercial buildings. Windows and glazed facades account for a significant fraction of heat gain or loss in a building, depending upon its geographic location and season. Most deployed glazing is non-responsive and relies on shuttering and blinds or sunscreens to modulate thermal gains and losses. If the thermo-physical performances of building envelopes could be dynamic, then much greater thermal efficiency could be achieved throughout varying climates. Therefore, the development of novel technologies allowing variable energy throughputs is strongly recommended. Smart windows, or switchable glazings, belong to the emerging category of products changing their light transmittance in response to an external stimulus. EC windows are recognized as a suitable technology, because they do not impede visibility like other conventional blinding systems, providing, at the same time, glare control and thermal/visual comfort management. For their potential impact on energy supply and saving, smart windows are expected to become important architectural components of future buildings. However, the technologies which have appeared so far suffer from several defects, such as: limited transmittance modulation, defects in homogeneity of coloration, dark spots and pinholes, uneven coloration due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the electric field applied, peripheral leakage for inefficient sealing, and, in some cases, a limited lifetime (6000 cycles per 5 years). If these problems can be solved, EC windows will offer unmitigated transparent views and a fine level of dynamic illumination control. To this end, an accurate strategy is required to maximize the advantages of devices, capable of reducing lighting energy use (up to 24%) and of reducing cooling demand as due to their non-responsive nature, user decision could partially limit their effectiveness. Photoelectrochromic devices (PECDs) ensure intrinsic advantages over earlier smart window designs, not requiring an external power source to change the transmittance. A self-powered photoelectrochromic window uses, in fact, the incident sunlight to modulate the optical behavior in a smart fashion. In the first seminal report by Bechinger et al. the architecture of PECDs was a combination of dye-sensitized cells (DSSCs) and EC layers. Since that first pivotal work, many different PECD architectures have been conceived, denoting strong interest around this new class of smart devices. Despite the important progress PECDs slowly approach a real market entry. This delay is undoubtedly connected to the partially deceiving expectations of PV building integration (BIPV). If, on one side, the planning of multifunctional building skins, capable of fulfilling various technical and legal demands, is a sort of “holy grail” for architects, house owners and glass companies, several factors like the cost efficiency ratio, psychological and technical aspects still act as limiting factors interfering with BIPVs' large diffusion. For instance, dye-solar cells, promising components of BIPV devices, despite a very simple manufacturing process, a low amount of active material per area (1 g m−2 sensitizer, 15 g m−2 of TiO2 and less than 30 ml m−2 for the electrolyte), and focused intensive research, are witnessing a not easy technology transfer from a fundamental research stage, in contrast to earlier expectations. Moreover, not all of the currently available PV technologies would be suitable to meet the multiple requirements of BIPVs. In fact, the main candidates are basically devices showing high transparency: DSSCs, a-Si cells, organic PVs and, more recently, solid-state heterojunction solar cells. Among them, neither DSCs nor OPVs have managed to gain, so far, the predicted increase in market share. Therefore, no significant advances have occurred in PECDs recently. In the last few years, however, new players and conditions have emerged with the potential to change this tendency. The already mentioned attention paid to energy related issues and the increasing investments in renewable energy are in fact increasing the market opportunity for BIPVs. This technology represents now about a 1 percent share of total PV installations worldwide, with a positive tendency for growth. In addition, novel material exploitation is leading to a renaissance of solution processable PVs and this review wants to underline how these events could bring new life to BIPVs and, more specifically, PECDs. Moreover, the reduction of purchase costs of EC glazings, which are still quite high with respect to standard low emittance glass, would further help the diffusion of this energy-saving technology. In the roadmap towards the design and fabrication of full solid-state PECDs, the chance to achieve single-substrate devices overcomes sealing problems and enhances the versatility of their building integration issues, inside insulated glazing units.

This review provides a critical overview of the scientific results obtained so far for PECDs, giving a critical analysis of previously reported research lines, but also some perspectives on future device developments. The aspects regarding materials, processing issues and device fabrication are thoroughly discussed. A specific paragraph is dedicated to the identification of current trends in the design of novel solid-state electrolyte formulations and about new efficient and highly transparent PV materials, compatible with building integration.

A PECD is a multifunctional object in which different components are brought together to combine their properties in a resulting innovative fashion. In particular, the first function consists in converting electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy (PV function) and the second one in varying the chromatic characteristics of the device itself, following an electric stimulus (EC function). The two functionalities require proper “gluing” agents, thus a complete device requires also an electrolyte, a transparent and conductive substrate and circuitry, Fig. 1. The device being a complex combination of players, its evolution is based on the development of all the components and it can be accelerated by a breakthrough in one related field. As a consequence of this positive combination, certain limitations associated with one or more components could be minimized by suitable device designs. We review, in this section, PECD constituents and their fundamental properties to better understand the development of device architectures and forthcoming perspectives.


Specific requirements have to be ideally comprised in the power supply component of a PECD. With diverse importance, and depending on the targeted application, those properties are: transparency (semi), color tunability, flexibility, robustness, easy processing, contained component costs and environmental compatibility. Different photovoltaic units have been and could be used for this scope, as their properties comprise most or some of the required ones. Among them are sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic solar cells (OPVs), silicon cells and solid-state heterojunction solar cells.


In its first conception, a PECD exploited the PV effect of sensitized solar cells to power an EC layer acting also as a counter electrode of the resulting electrochemical cell. Noticeably, the DSSC is the ideal inspiring photovoltaic device aiming at PECDs; it contains, in fact, most of its components, see in Fig. 2 a schematic reproduction of a DSSC.

Starting from this design, Bechinger and co-workers introduced an EC layer (WO3) replacing the platinum counter electrode (the working principle of the EC layer is discussed in Section 2.2), thus the load developed by the TiO2/dye interface promotes the coloration of WO3. Noticeably, this device offers dual applications, since the generated electrons can either be transported out of the device as a power source or be charged within the device as an energy saving device. The most important characteristics of DSSCs in view of the exploitation as a power supply of a PECD are: transparency or semitransparency in the visible spectral region (i), color tunability (ii), robustness (iii), easy processing (iv), contained component costs (v) and environmental compatibility (vi).
(i) Films made of oxide nanoparticles provide a simple and powerful means to achieve efficient harvesting of sunlight by the adsorbed dye monolayer, as this mesoporous matrix largely increases the surface area. Conversely a reduction of the thickness increases device transparency, and considering the most important function of the power supply of a PECD being to power the EC layer such a scope can be reached by very thin photoanodes. Depending on the area and on the efficiency of the EC layer currents as low as a few mA (1–2 mA) could be sufficient. Such small currents could be obtained, also thanks to the recent advancement of DSSCs, with photoanodes absorbing less than 30% in the region of the maximum dye absorption of the light over almost the whole solar spectrum.
(ii) Color tunability is one of the prominent properties of DSSCs, in fact the pigment responsible for light harvesting could be easily changed and with it the color of the device, different combinations of pigments could also be used and thus complex coloring achieved. In Fig. 3 are reported a few examples of differently colored semitransparent DSSCs and building integrated cells.
(iii) Sensitized solar cells are among the solar converting technologies alternative to silicon, those showing the most promising results in terms of device stability. Noticeably, with the aim of integrating such devices in buildings, besides the initial electrical characteristics of the device in terms of energy production, reliability of the facade throughout the lifetime of the device is mandatory. DSSCs have not yet passed the standard stability test for silicon panels: light soaking at 80 °C for 1000 h although devices stored at room temperature have already shown impressive stability under continuous illumination of 12000 h and 8000 h at 2.5 Sun. Additionally, an amazing long-term stability of 25000 h at 55 °C under 0.8 Sun illumination has been achieved.
(iv) In the last 20 years important advancements have led to key progress in the manufacturing of sensitized cells. Printing/coating techniques are now extensively used in almost all of the manufacturing processes. The versatility of printing technologies and their intrinsic ability to outperform other techniques in large-area deposition boost (DSSCs) technology up to commercialization levels, as such devices can be fabricated by adopting all of the main printing techniques on both rigid and flexible substrates. This allows an easy tuning of cell/module characteristics to the desired application. An important example of technology scaling is constituted by G24 Power, one of the world leaders in DSSC manufacturing. This company, thanks to the use of R2R processing, has the capability of manufacturing more than 500000 linear meters of DSSC modules per year (http://gcell.com).
(v) Recent lifetime cycle assessment (LCA) for sensitized solar modules showed that this technology compares favorably with other PV technologies regarding the embedded energy of the PV module even for a far from optimum laboratory fabrication procedure. The embedded energy value for laboratory cell production is much less than the average value calculated for crystalline silicon technologies and it is of the same order of magnitude as thin film technologies. Depending on the module efficiencies very low energy payback times between 1.5 and 1 year can be achieved, well in line with the ones of polycrystalline silicon (1.5 year).
(vi) Environmental, health and safety considerations of dye-sensitized titanium dioxide solar cells indicate that some precautions are necessary to mitigate hazards that could result in worker exposure. Metal alkoxides, which could be found as solid powders or dispersed in alcohol solutions, require certain precautions in storage and handling, if titanium dioxide is fabricated on-site at the manufacturing plant. Toxicological information about the ruthenium-based dye and its environmental compatibility is not available, but the dye is used in very small quantities and occupational exposure should not be an issue. The electrolytes currently used contain fairly common organic solvents (acetonitrile, propionitrile, and methoxy-propionitrile) that are flammable, volatile, and toxic. A potential concern, especially foreseeing building integration is represented by liquid corrosive electrolytes that in the case of rupture or linkages could pollute the building environment. This has been probably one of the most important historic limitations to the diffusion of sensitized solar cells, and the strong effort toward solid electrolytes is the logical consequence of such issues.

An alternative power supply for PECDs is represented by organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). Such solar cells have recently reached power conversion efficiencies of above 10%. Typical OPVs consist of a mixture of a polymer (or an organic small molecule) donor and a C60 derivative acceptor as the photoactive layer, Fig. 4.

Semiconducting polymers and devices are ideally suitable power sources for PECDs since they couple (i) semitransparency (ii) tunability of the color (iii) solution processability and (iv) potentially flexible architectures. Deposition of organics by screen-printing, doctor blading, inkjet printing, and spray deposition is possible because these materials can be made soluble. These techniques are a fundamental requirement towards the high-throughput roll-to-roll processing that will drive down the cost of polymer-based PVs. Additionally, they all take place at low temperature, which allows devices to be fabricated on plastic substrates for flexible devices. Lightweight and flexibility are qualities that offer a plethora of diverse uses of these devices, as well as an easier accessibility to building integration. The fundamental weakness embedded in OPVs lies in their stability, a problem not yet fully solved that importantly impacts the device scalability.

In the last couple of years, a new and very promising PV family of materials for semitransparent solar cells has emerged. These materials are the metal halide perovskites. These are low-cost, solution-processable semiconductors that form in the ABX3 perovskite crystal structure, where A = Cs, NH2CH2NH3 (formamidinium, FA) or CH3NH3 (methylammonium, MA), B = Sn, Pb, and X = I, Br, or Cl. Changing the components of the material affords bandgap tunability. The most studied versions of this material are MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, with bandgaps of ∼1.57 eV and ∼1.48 eV respectively. Opaque PV devices based on these materials have risen from 3.8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) to a certified 20.1% in a couple of years, making this the fastest-growing photovoltaic technology yet. Clearly such a promising technology would be ideal for incorporation into a semi-transparent device. As well as for building-integrated applications, semi-transparent perovskite solar cells have attracted a lot of attention for their potential use in tandem architectures; the tunable bandgap of the perovskite material is well-suited to form a top cell with a silicon solar cell, as a way to ‘piggyback’ into the tough photovoltaic market. Typically, a perovskite device consists of a bulk layer of the perovskite sandwiched between electron and hole selective contacts, themselves in contact with the anode and cathode, respectively. In order to make a semitransparent solar cell, all layers of the device must be as transparent as possible. The metric which must be optimised is the efficiency of the device as a function of transparency – and especially for aesthetic purposes, we note that it is the average visible transparency, between 370 nm and 740 nm, which must be considered here. The perovskite is normally thick enough to absorb all light, rendering it opaque; this must be made semi-transparent somehow. Typically, the top electrode is a thick metal, which must be replaced effectively by a highly transparent conducting material. Additionally, there can be significant optical losses in the selective materials and the rear transparent conductor; these should also be minimised. There have been two main routes pursued to making the perovskite material itself semi-transparent, the key difference being the importance placed on aesthetics. The easiest way to make a semiconductor film transparent is to make it thinner; when the thickness is less than the absorption depth, some light will be allowed through. However, due to the nature of the density of states in a direct gap semiconductor, which increases monotonically from the band edge, the absorption of a thin semiconducting film will not have a spectrally flat transmission, it will increase from the bandgap. For a material with a bandgap of ∼1.57 eV, for example, it will appear brown-tinted – not especially attractive. One possible solution could foresee the blending of perovskite with an additional chromophore, being a polymer or an organic molecule, to intelligently tailor the resulting colour. For a building-integrated photovoltaic window, while some architects may wish to use colourful designs and tinted panels, there is most demand for a neutral-coloured semi-transparent photovoltaic, that is, it appears as only a neutral-colour tinting of the window. The neutral coloured approach was first explored. By leveraging particular combinations of solvents, annealing temperature and thickness, Eperon et al. showed that it was possible to control the morphology of the perovskite layer to the extent that it formed discontinuous ‘islands’ of the perovskite, see Fig. 5. These were small enough to be invisible to the naked eye and thick enough to absorb all light; the combination of fully absorbing and transparent areas provided an attractive neutral-tinted film. In the initial instance, the MAPbI3 perovskite was used with thin gold electrodes, realising PCEs of 3.5% with 30% AVT to 8% with 10% full device AVT. The controllable morphology enabled a wide range of transparencies and efficiencies to be reached. Recently, subsequent work has replaced the microstructured MAPbI3 with the more efficient FAPbI3 and employed a more transparent Ni mesh contact (see later), to reach superior PCEs of over 5% for 30% AVT, with excellent angular dependence. More recently, this approach has been adapted by Aharon et al., who used a templating grid to control the morphology of the perovskite films to provide a more regular structured film, achieving a PCE of 5% at 20% AVT. The downside of this approach is that the large contact area between the hole and electron transporters, between the islands, reduces the open-circuit voltage that can be attained by the devices. In order to increase efficiencies in this architecture, a clever approach to prevent these shunt-resistor pathways will be necessary.

The brown-tinted approach of making a thin continuous perovskite film is simple to achieve and has thus been reported much more often, with the initial report of this strategy by Roldan-Carmina et al. using dual-source evaporated MAPbI3 perovskite films of 100 nm with thin gold electrodes to achieve PCEs of over 6% for an AVT of 30%. Subsequently, perovskite solution-processing methods have been employed in a variety of ways and a detailed strategy to optimise thin film production has been detailed by Quiroz et al.
Most research effort on perovskite solar cells since these initial reports has focussed on making more transparent contacting electrodes. Initial work, following work form the organic photovoltaic community, used solution-processed silver nanowires to achieve good transparencies suitable for incorporation into either semitransparent perovskite cells or 4-terminal tandem architectures. The best of these achieve ∼9% PCE for ∼28% PCE. However, further work showed that these contacts were unstable – the silver would react with the halide in the perovskite causing rapid degradation, especially in the presence of moisture. A solution was developed by Chang and co-workers, who used atomic layer deposition to deposit an alumina buffer layer, resulting in excellent air stability and little drop in performance. This is, in our opinion, one of the most promising approaches – they achieve 10% PCE for 25% AVT. Another technique known from the organic photovoltaic community is a dielectric–metal–dielectric electrode, applied to perovskites by Cheng and co-workers to achieve ∼9% PCE with ∼30% AVT. A final option for using structured metallic electrodes is to use a nickel mesh, laminated onto the cell with a PEDOT:PSS/adhesive composite, which has been used in both thick perovskite devices and the semitransparent microstructured devices discussed above. An obvious route to explore would be to sputter a known TCO such as ITO, IZO, or ZnO:Al onto the top surface of the perovskite cell. These are stable and transparent materials. However, sputtering these is quite a violent technique and it appears to damage the perovskite devices beneath. A way around this is to use a buffer layer underneath the sputtered ITO to protect the cell. This has been achieved using a layer of MoO3 by several groups, focussing on tandem applications. Other options for transparent contacts, investigated in perovskite devices, include carbon nanotubes, though the conductivity is too low to allow really efficient devices, or graphene. Graphene, the immensely popular single-layered carbon structure, is extremely transparent and conductive, so if a robust production method can be realised this could be an extremely promising option. The first report of this as a top electrode, by Yan and co-workers, showed an impressive 12% PCE with 70% transmission at 700 nm. These carbon-based materials have the added advantage of being flexible, so could be employed in a roll-to-roll production line, for example.
In order to boost the efficiency even higher, it will be necessary to reduce the parasitic losses in the hole and electron selective contacts. This is certainly an overlooked but important area; the typical hole transporters spiro-OMeTAD and PEDOT:PSS are fairly absorptive. So far only one effective method has been employed by Jen and co-workers; using copper thiocyanate and a thin silver electrode to achieve impressive 10% PCE/25% AVT combination. Further efforts in reducing other losses in the cell will be crucial to developing the highest performing semitransparent devices. Considering non brown-tinted devices, aside from the morphological control, one way of making more attractive coloured films is by changing the perovskite bandgap by tuning the halide content. Furthermore, optical interference and transmittance effects can be employed; optical microcavities and photonic crystals have been used to make various coloured devices, that may be of interest for colourful tinted windows, see Fig. 6. Clearly, for a photovoltaic window in a building, operation must be guaranteed for a long time, preferably >25 years. It is known that the perovskite materials are susceptible to moisture and even oxygen under certain conditions, so stability testing is of the utmost importance. We direct the reader to a recent review on perovskite stability. In short, with adequate atmospheric barriers, in our opinion there appears to be no fundamental barrier to long-term operation of perovskite devices, though certainly more stringent testing is required. The future of the field may lie in more thermally stable analogues of the MA-based materials commonly employed; larger organic cations or inorganic cations should provide much superior stability.

The use of silicon technology for PVs is still the dominant solution on the market. It provides stable and robust modules, reaching efficiencies of around 15% for multi-crystalline materials and up to 20% for mono-crystalline alternatives. For meeting the criteria of semi-transparency required by PECD applications, due to the intrinsic rigidity and color of silicon, modules need to be arranged in arrays of cells which allow light to pass through. To achieve this architecture, glass–glass encapsulation solutions need to be employed, carefully pondering the distance between the cells. Alternatives to silicon cell arrays have been explored to achieve semi-transparency, clearly losing PV efficiency. The use of a thin amorphous silicon layer has been proposed by Shizukuishi et al. employing a parallel-type EC device with the structure glass|ITO|a-Si|Cr2O3|Cr2O3·V2O5|WO3|Au, whereas Deb et al. developed a device employing a wide-band-gap a-Si1−xCx|H n–i–p PV cell as a semi-transparent power source and an LiyWO3|LiAlF4|V2O5 EC device. See Section 2.5.


According to Roger J. Mortimer's definition, EC materials are chemical species that can be electrochemically switched between different colors. The color change is between a bleached state and a colored state, or between two colored states. Most applications require high contrast ratio, coloration efficiency, cycle life and write–erase efficiency, as well as specific response times. See Appendix – Section 4. Following this classification, we identified the major classes of EC materials, adopting the same sorting approach. Electrochromism is considered a “green”, or “benign” nanotechnology, it could be based on cheap and abundant, non-toxic raw materials aiming at low-cost manufacturing; additionally, robust and reliable performances would be required for mass production, niche applications and energetically efficient building integration. The complexity of issues regarding the exploitation of EC devices does not allow facile identification of an ideal – organic or inorganic – material for the given purposes. In each case, critical considerations will take into account several aspects, such as cost, efficiency, production speed, even on flexible substrates, environmental impact, low power consumption, as well as the availability of multiple color states.

EC behavior has been observed in a plethora of materials. A complete discussion of such material properties and characteristics cannot be given here but only a general overview of the main classes: from the widely explored transition metal oxides (TMOs), to conjugated polymers (CP) passing by small molecules (SM). This discussion could be a useful tool aiming at rationalizing the wide extent of approaches exploited to date in designing EC materials.

The majority of studies concerning TMOs with EC properties are mainly based on tungsten and nickel. Thus their preparation parameters, stoichiometry, deposition parameters and composition have been thoroughly studied. EC oxides are typically subdivided into two main kinds: cathodic and anodic. The former color under ion insertion, whereas the latter undergo optical transition upon ion extraction. A previous review of these materials is contained in the Handbook of inorganic EC materials. The most known cathodic films are made of tungsten oxide (WO3); it has been prepared by means of a wide range of techniques: mainly physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrophoretic deposition and chemical depositions, such as electrochemical and solution processing. Also titanium, niobium, tantalum and molybdenum oxides are cathodic EC materials. Molybdenum oxide shows analogous properties to WO3. Several studies have appeared dealing with this cathodic EC material, prepared by evaporation, CVD, wet chemical techniques and electrodeposition. Another inorganic EC oxide is titanium oxide, whose EC properties have been explored for films made by PVC, CVD, spray pyrolysis, doctor blading, wet chemical techniques and anodization. Niobium oxide has also shown EC performances in chemically prepared films. Anodic EC oxides are mainly nickel oxide – prepared by thermal evaporation, CVD, sputtering and other techniques – typically complementary to WO3 in the first applications of smart windows. Another relevant, but expensive anodic EC material is iridium oxide, made by PVD, mainly. Also vanadium oxide, which is recognized as an intermediate EC oxide, has been prepared by PVD and chemical techniques. Typical anodic inorganic EC oxides are based on: nickel, manganese, iron, cobalt, rhodium and iridium, exhibiting analogous features. Vanadium is considered a hybrid EC material.

EC devices containing TMOs consist typically of a multilayered battery-like architecture. Differently from photochromic materials, whose coloration relies on UV solar irradiation thus not suitable for architectural glazings and automotive applications, the optical modulation associated with EC materials ensues from their specific behavior. An EC device generally contains: substrates, transparent conductive oxides, an ion conductor electrolyte and one or two EC materials. The latter, in the form of films, conduct either ions and electrons thus ought to be considered “mixed conductors”. Optical absorption varies when electrons move into the EC material from the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and simultaneously, charge balancing ions enter from the electrolyte (intercalation process). Typically, an EC device contains two complementary materials (anodic and cathodic, respectively) which both color under application of an external voltage, shuttling ions across the electrolyte, or ion conducting materials, interposed between two electrodes, see Fig. 7. Such ions are usually small cationic species (preferably H+ or Li+), contained in a liquid, gel or solid electrolyte. The selection of ions involved in the intercalation/deintercalation process strongly influences the process kinetics. Insertion and extraction of ions in EC materials can be simplified with these elementary reactions, regarding cathodic and anodic materials:
[WO3 + H+ + e−]bleached ↔ [HWO3]colored
and

[Ni(OH)2]bleached ↔ [NiOOH + H+ + e−]colored
A general consensus has been reached, in the scientific world, about the mechanism of optical absorption for the most used cathode material: WO3. First of all, the coloration reaction should only be partial in order to be reversible with the colored compound written in the form HxWO3 so that x < 0.5. WO3 tends to form substoichiometric phases with octahedral arrangement. Some of the WO6 octahedra are not corner sharing but edge sharing. As a direct consequence, a three dimensional network of tunnels ensues from the spatial arrangement of this building blocks. Such tunnels act as effective conduits for small ions. The deposition parameters, like pressure or substrate temperature influence the structural properties of films obtained, with effects on the EC properties of films. As demonstrated by Berggren for sputtered WO3, lithium intercalation, even to a wide extent, leads to a broad asymmetric peak around an energy of 1.3 eV. Further, understanding the theoretical basis of WO3 optical properties requires the investigation of its peculiar electron band structure, compatible with its octahedral packing; the latter is responsible for a splitting of metal d levels into eg and tg. Such levels are separated from oxygen 2p bonds and give rise to the energy gap. In pure WO3, the 2p levels are full and the d ones empty. For this reason, under these conditions, it is a transparent wide gap semiconductor. Filling of d bands, even partially, due to electron diffusion inside the material, leads to several shades of coloration. Ion intercalation and electron insertion cause a localization of electrons on tungsten sites, and W6+ sites are reduced, becoming W5+. This transfer of electrons between close tungsten sites is possible upon gaining enough energy due to the absorption of a photon. More transitions have been observed between more sites: W4+ and W6+, W4+ and W5+.
The EC performances of devices are usually limited by the kinetics of charge transport, stability and the ion transport properties of the electrolyte as well as the specific properties of EC materials. Zheng et al. have shown that nanostructuring of WO3 can enhance its EC performances by increasing the surface to volume ratio, altering surface energies and originating quantum confinement effects, influencing charge transport, the electronic band structure and the optical properties. It is well known that voltage biasing generates three kinds of electrochemical reaction in transition metal oxides, taking place on their surface or inside them. The first one takes place at the interface between the electrolyte and the EC oxide. A thin Helmoltz layer of absorbed ions arises on its surface. By applying a voltage, a second layer of ions with opposite charge will constitute the so called outer Helmoltz layer. Electrons inject into the oxide reaching the interface of the metal oxide. The adsorption of solvated cations renders the surface neutral. The second electrochemical reaction causes ions to enter the bulk surface of the oxide. The reverse process, activated by opportunely changing the bias, is a diffusion controlled deintercalation process. Nanostructuring the metal oxide dramatically enhances the diffusion kinetics. Three-dimensional networks of transition metal oxides provide a modification of the electrolyte–oxide interface and this could be obtained by means of mesoporous oxide layers. Recently, inorganic EC materials have been produced in the form of nanoparticles, nanorods and nanowires, with a high surface-to-volume ratio and nanodimensional features. Nanostructured EC materials show serious improvements in the major figures of merit: kinetics and coloration efficiency. Porous oxides allow deep electrolyte penetration, increased reaction sites available, shortening of the ion diffusion length and agile movement of cations across the interface.

Rosseinsky et al. have reported EC uses of the Prussian Blue (PB) pigment, with a ferric ferrocyanide chromic center forming a highly insoluble colloid with strong absorbance in the range between 650 nm and 720 nm. EC systems containing PB preferably adopted chloride-containing electrolytes, like KCl, where K+ is a balancing cation. A very low voltage, applied to the conductive substrate, activates an electron transfer at the PB film between 0.6 V and 0.2 V vs. Ag(AgCl), turning it into Everett's salt state. Such a reversible process can be inverted depending on the applied potential. Deposition of the PB film thickness influenced the required potential and the absorption range, as a consequence. PB has been successfully adopted in the design of solid-state EC devices. Starting from the consideration that Prussian blue films can be switched to green and colorless redox states, as first reported by Neff, Mortimer reported an interesting polychromicity (including a purple color state) of PB films by involving an outer layer of the ion-exchange polymer Nafion to a PB film as well as a methyl viologen dication (colorless)/radical cation (purple) system, incorporated by ion-exchange into the Nafion.

Similar approaches have also been explored, among metal metallohexacyanates: ruthenium purple, vanadium hexacyanoferrate, nickel hexacyanoferrate, copper hexacyanoferrate, palladium hexacyanoferrate and gallium hexacyanoferrate.
Beverina et al. have reviewed the family of violenes, i.e. the general structural principle for compounds having the capacity of reversible two-stage electron transfer. Monk and coworkers have produced a huge work about EC materials based on bipyridilium species, commonly named viologens, due to their intense violet color, or also paraquat. Viologens (Fig. 8) have a relevance among Weitz type violene compounds because of their remarkable electrochemical features.
Recently, Palenzuela et al. have reported flexible EC devices containing ethyl viologen, with indium tin oxide – polyethylene electrodes, coated with reduced graphene oxide films electrodeposited from graphene oxide aqueous solutions, with very interesting results, see Fig. 9. Transition-metal complexes contain metal ions and ligands and show highly customizable chromogenic activity due to rich electronic transitions: metal-localized transitions, ligand-localized transitions and those resulting from interactions of metal and ligands. These transitions are altered or eliminated upon reduction or oxidation of their metal center, resulting in a chromogenic behavior. For solid-state ECs, metal coordination complexes represent a very interesting perspective. In detail, polypyridyl ligands have shown the tendency to form stable complexes with several transition metals, with good EC properties, as in the case of bipyridyl complexes. Thin films can in fact host polypyridyl complexes by oxidative or reductive polymerization. Another class of metal coordination complexes is represented by metallophthalocyanines.

EC conjugated polymers are considered promising candidates worldwide for a variety of optical devices such as displays, sensors, e-paper and “smart” windows, due to their easy processability, rapid switching time and high optical contrast. The electrochromism observed in this class of materials is generally associated with changes in the π-electronic character upon electrochemically reversible insertion and extraction of ions through the polymer film.

These polymers, insulating in their neutral states, undergo a change in the band structure when electrochemically or chemically doped (p or n for oxidation or reduction). As a consequence, lower intraband transitions are created and charge carriers are formed (polarons and bipolarons), giving rise to increased conductivity and optical modulation. The main optical absorption band in reduced neutral-colored conjugated polymers is due to a π–π* transition through the bandgap, involving UV/VIS radiation, see Fig. 9. When doped by oxidation or reduction, polaronic and bipolaronic transitions produce absorption bands at lower energy levels. CP films having energy gaps higher than 3 eV appear colorless whereas if the energy gap is lower (roughly 1.5 eV) they are colored (Fig. 10). Some EC polymers can still appear colorless, even in a doped form. This is the case for highly transparent sky-blue oxidized states.
The wide body of results on EC conjugated polymers can be briefly discussed here. They are mainly electrochromes switching between an absorptive colored state and a near-colorless state. They can color by cathodic and anodic mechanisms, like other electrochromes, (see Fig. 11). Cathodic conjugated polymers are absorptive in the visible region (reduced state) and become colorless upon oxidation; anodic ones are colorless when neutral, and become absorptive in the visible region, upon oxidation. Polymers absorbing at high energy (yellow) are those based on 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), thiophenes and 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) combined with pyrenes and naphthalenes or poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) PProDOT substituted at the 1,3-position with t-butyl groups. A copolymerization of a ProDOT unit with a phenylene unit allowed the transition between a highly transmissive oxidized state and a yellow neutral state. Similar efforts have been required for orange-to-transmissive coloring. Xu et al., synthesized blue (ProDOT-MePro) and red (ProDOP-Et2) color changeable EC monomers, and EC polymer films were formed by electropolymerization. 3,4-Propylenedioxypyrrole (ProDOP) exhibiting a 2.2 eV bandgap has been reported with a brown intermediate state. This was obtained by employing a solution-processable thiophene homopolymer (poly{3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene}) and EC polymer-orange (ECP-orange). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP) has also shown a red-to-transmissive switching behavior and a wide bandgap of about 2.0 eV. On the other hand, ECP-Red has been demonstrated to be a suitable solution-processable red polymer, derived from ECP-orange random incorporation of small dimethoxythiophene units.
An effective switching between a blue state and a highly transmissive state has been observed in neutral films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) PEDOT (bandgap 1.6 eV), obtained in situ by oxidative polymerization of EDOT to form an insoluble film. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate PEDOT:PSS, i.e. a water processable dispersion with the polyelectrolyte PSS has also been demonstrated to be a successful conjugated EC polymer.
A polymer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxyselenophene) (PEDOS) has been reported for its switching between a dark blue neutral state and a transmissive oxidized state. EDOS is more electron-rich than thiophene, showing a lower bandgap and lower oxidation potential than EDOT. These interesting properties, also including a high conductivity, a lower band gap, rigidity, multicolor electrochromism, and rapid redox switching, allow the use of these materials in a variety of electronic applications, for example PEDOS-CG, obtained on substitution with a hexyl chain, has achieved a visible contrast as high as 89% in 0.75 s. Green to transmissive switching EC polymers have been obtained in electrochemically polymerized bis EDOT–(benzothiadiazole)BTD polymers, switching from a green neutral state to a light blue oxidized state. It has been reported that a convenient tuning of absorbing peaks can be obtained by changing the ratio between ProDOT (donor) and BTD heterocycles (acceptor). More difficulties have been found in the attempt to develop a single material switching from a transmissive state to a full absorbing state (across the visible region). To this aim chromophore mixing has been exploited, starting from effective green-to-transmissive (copolymers of BTD with varying amounts of ProDOT were overlaid with a magenta polymer, see Fig. 11).
The first example of a black-to-transmissive electrochrome resulted from a copolymerization of a bis(ProDOT)–BTD trimer and a ProDOT monomer (ECP-Black1). Another approach foresaw the use of two EDOT monomers, bridged by a naphthalenediimide unit, allowing a switching between a highly transmissive and a dark blue bleached state.
Anodic electrochromes with a large bandgap have also been reported. Nevertheless, it has been observed that it is quite complicated to finely design and control the color states of multicolored conductive polymers, so as to precisely predict the absorption spectra. Several systems switch between two or more colored states without any fully transmissive condition. The idea of creating a set of redox states in different positions of the polymer backbone involves one of the most thoroughly investigated EC polymers:polyaniline (PANI). This polymer has been considered a promising EC material due to its conduction mechanism, unique optical properties and its high environmental stability. Its electrical and chromic properties do not only depend on its oxidation states, but also on its protonation state. Oxidation states of PANI are described by different neutral forms, leucoemeraldine base (LB) form (fully reduced), emeraldine base (EB) form (half oxidized), pernigraline base (PB) form (fully oxidized). The doping process by means of the protonation of the imine group basic sites along the polymer backbone results in the emeraldine salt (ES) form, responsible for the strong increment of the conducting properties. Since each oxidation state has its own color, ranging from transparent yellow to green to dark blue, PANI films are named polyelectrochromic. Furthermore, the color of PANI films can be reversibly switched at relatively low voltages (−0.2 V to 1.0 V). A yellow-toned color can be obtained with the LS (−0.2 V to 0.0 V), a partial oxidation to the ES form leads to a green color at about 0.4 V, a second oxidation process, between 0.6 V and 0.9V, leads to the blue/violet pernigraniline form. Recently, nanocomposite materials based on PANI and CNTs were effectively adopted as EC materials with enhanced optical contrast. For example, Xiong et al. synthesized PANI–SWNT nanocomposites via copolymerization of aniline with SWCNT–PPD (para-phenylenediamine) in aqueous solutions containing poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS). The enhancement of electron transport in the EC layer greatly improves its redox reactivity, especially when PANI is switched to its low conductive states, as evidenced by the significantly reduced charge-transfer resistances (see Fig. 12).
Multicolored EC polymers have also been reported as a result of a copolymerization process, under oxidative conditions. Then, 100% BiEDOT polymers showed blue spectral properties, whereas BiEDOT–NMeCz appeared yellow. Intermediate ratios offered a range of customizable shades.
An alternative strategy consisted in systems having a conjugated backbone with a set of spectral changes and chromophores attached on it, providing further chromic responses. Yiğit et al. appended azobenzene, coumarine and fluorescent derivatives onto terthiophene scaffolds. Du Bois et al. have illustrated polymer systems with a combination of donor and acceptor units in order to generate multicolor EC polymers due to the availability of multiple redox states. For instance, poly(bisEDOT pyridine) shows a red neutral state, an oxidized blue-purple state and a reduced blue state. The basicity of the pyridine unit allows protonation of the neutral polymer, leading to a corresponding navy blue state. Polymers could suffer from stability issues, thus degradation under ultraviolet irradiation was investigated by Jensen et al. showing that photochemically stable EC devices with convincing operational lifetimes can be constructed with a relatively simple process.

NIR EC materials have also been reported, but they are especially useful for optical attenuators, in communication wavelengths. Such EC materials can include transition metal oxides and transition metal complexes and show high stability and reversibility. Even better NIR EC features have been reported for organic materials showing up-scaling advantages and cheaper production as well as high color contrast.

Aromatic quinones, aromatic imides, anthraquinone imides and poly(triarylanine)s have been reported. Apart from considerable visible electrochromism, PEDOT also showed chromogenic properties in the NIR region, mainly attributed to a bipolaron charge carrier, see Fig. 13.
PEDOT is one of the most advanced EC conjugated polymers; as clearly noticeable in Fig. 13, an increase of the applied voltage results in a decrease of the absorption band in the visible region, with a concurrent increase of another band, peaking at 900 nm, which depends on the optical band of the polaron charge carrier.

Typical EC materials do not allow “dual-band” features, i.e. independent control over the visible and near infrared regions of the solar spectrum. The coloration mechanism of conventional ECs is ruled by Faradaic processes and, for this reason, they show slow kinetics as well as a limited cycle life. Plasmonic electrochromism, especially investigated by D. Milliron and her research group, aims at enabling faster switching times, longer durability and enhanced spectral selectivity, new concepts for EC devices could derive from the use of plasmonic TCO nanocrystals, operating under a capacitive mechanism. Electrochemical injection of electrons into plasmonic TCO nanocrystal films induces a shift in the plasmon frequency, giving rise to the new functionality of selective optical modulation in the NIR region of the solar spectrum. If these nanocrystals are combined with other EC materials, advanced “dual-band” EC electrodes can be achieved. According to specifically customized localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), adsorption and reflection of light could be tuned, by suitably integrating plasmonic colloidal nanocrystals into heterogeneous nanocomposite electrolytes. EC behavior due to the plasmonic effect has been observed in chalcogenide nanocrystals (like CdSe) and highly doped metal oxide semiconductors (Sb:SnO2; ATO) and doped metal oxides, like Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO) and Al-doped ZnO (AZO). The latter ones are especially useful for NIR-selective plasmonic electrochromism. A composite EC material containing NIR-selective plasmonic nanocrystals of ITO embedded in a matrix of niobium oxide, with visible switching capability was demonstrated by Llordes in 2013: a potential-dependent spectrally-selective optical device showing three-way operating modes. Visible light was absorbed by NbOx at lower voltages via polaron transitions. At higher voltages ITO nanocrystals were depleted of free electrons and the film was highly transparent; at intermediate voltages, the capacitive charging of ITO nanocrystals was activated, increasing the free electron concentration and the exploitation of LSPR in the NIR region, since the spectral response was dominated by the concentration of free electrons in the nanocrystals.

The above-mentioned achievements demonstrate how electrochromism, through the exploitation of a large number of innovative materials, has greatly advanced over the past few years, providing widespread applications in light-regulation and displays. Smart windows have indeed a special appeal from the economic and environmental points of view. In a recent, interesting review, Yang and his coworkers discussed the versatility of EC materials in terms of integration in multifunctional devices. They considered how pseudocapacitors and batteries are generally associated with faradaic reactions at the electrode surface and bulk, respectively, through which charges are stored. When a faradaic reaction occurs with charge transfer, some electrode materials will reversibly change color. This phenomenon is well known as electrochromism. But the EC process happens when the charge injects or ejects, and this demonstrates that EC devices can be integrated with charge storage devices. The optimal combination of materials in devices is at the basis of the integration in multifunctional devices. Clear research trends are visible, currently, towards the integration of EC materials with devices devoted to energy storage but also photovoltaic generation or other fields, like diagnostics or displays. The development of nanomaterials with enhanced performances and their integration in multifunctional devices represent a clearly visible “path” for future evolutions in the chromogenic field: one of the potential strategies towards their effective exploitation in everyday life.

The electrolyte is one of the main components in a chromogenic device, being responsible, most of the time, for connecting the power supply to the EC system. Similarly to electrolytes in batteries and other electrochemical systems (fuel cells, supercapacitors, DSSCs, etc.), these conductive ion media separate the cathode and anode terminals providing ion flow between the electrodes while preventing electronic charge transfer (short circuit). Today's commercial applications of common lithium-ion batteries as well as EC devices employ electrolytes in liquid form, lithium salts in flammable liquids such as organic aprotic solvents, requiring a separator to physically isolate the electrode materials to avoid thereby short circuits and ensure safe operation. Despite semi-ideal ion conductive properties, numerous attempts were made to replace liquid solvent-based electrolytes with safer quasi-solid and solid forms. In addition to a reduced reactivity and flammability, solid-state electrolytes, acting simultaneously as binders and separators, facilitate the electrical contact between the cathode and anode components. In the meantime, these systems offer the chance to be processed in thin solid films conferring higher mechanical strength, superior long-term durability, and improved thermal and electrochemical stability. However, a reduced ion conductivity if compared to liquid systems (>1 mS cm−1) remains the major limit that needs to be addressed for the successful realization of competitive solid-state devices. Therefore, the design of ideal electrolytes for effective systems passes from a proper consideration of both their chemico-physical properties and the specific device architectural and functional characteristics. Numerous original studies and critical reviews have been reported in the literature dealing with novel and efficient electrolytes for electrochemical applications, for the most part in the field of lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells. Generally, the different types of electrolytes are classified into four major categories: liquid, ceramic, solid inorganic and polymer electrolytes.

The latter ones represent the ideal candidates for developing advanced electrochemical systems especially for chromogenic devices and lithium-ion batteries, offering undisputed advantages of being easily processable in thin films and acting simultaneously as separators and binders. Furthermore, they possess a reduced reactivity, due to a very low content of flammable organic liquid solvents, and an overall stability in terms of long-term durability, tolerance to shock, vibration and mechanical deformation. For these substantial reasons, a wide range of polymer electrolytes has been accurately designed for a facile integration in chromogenic devices. To this aim some key requirements should be fulfilled. In addition to their inherent structural and functional properties including high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, and chemical, thermal and electrochemical stability, they must have a high optical transparency withstanding no light scattering effects, long-term stability against solar UV radiation, compatibility with the anodic and cathodic layers and a negligible environmental impact. Finally, employing inexpensive polymers would be beneficial for their large-scale development and potential commercialization. Polymer electrolytes are generally referred to as any macromolecular or supramolecular nano-aggregate system characterized by a significant ionic conductivity (above 10−7 S cm−1), and they can be classified into different types: solid polymers, gel polymers, plasticized polymers, ionic rubber polymers and ion conducting polyelectrolytes. Apart from polyelectrolytes, most of them are complexes of polyethylene oxide (PEO) containing lithium salts. This host polymer is an optimal solvating agent for a wide range of metal salts with a major affinity for hard cations, i.e. Li+. However, practically useful ionic conductivity values (of approximately 10−4 S cm−1) are achieved only for temperatures of around 60–80 °C when the polymer is in an amorphous state. This condition determines an increase of the polymer free volume with higher mobility of the polymer chains in the amorphous region and consequent fast ion transport. As a result, different approaches have been adopted to obtain an amorphous degree of the polymer–Li+ salt complex at room temperature. One of the most effective strategies consists in adding liquid plasticizers, such as aprotic organic solvents (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide) or low molecular weight polyethylene glycols (PEG), which has led to the development of plasticized electrolytes suitable for several electrochemical devices, including ECDs and PECDs. In addition to PEO-based polymer electrolytes, various co-polymer matrices containing polar elements (i.e. oxygen or nitrogen) along the chains, for example poly(propylene oxide) (PPO), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), have been effectively employed to prepare suitable gel and plasticized polymer electrolytes. Recently, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) copolymers, particularly poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF–HFP) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF–TrFE), have been used as efficient plasticized electrolyte layers in quasi-solid EC and PEC devices. Unlike PVDF, its copolymers turn out to be more suitable for practical applications due to a better solvating power for lithium salts and increased ion transport properties associated with the amorphous HFP or TrFE phase. Nguyen et al. reported a high performance EC device fabricated by using polyaniline dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (PANI-DBSA) as an anodic material, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(4-styrene sulfonic acid) PEDOT:PSS as an ion storage medium and PVDF-TrFE plasticized with PEG (8000 Mw) as an electrolyte layer, demonstrating the high ionic conductivity of these electrolyte systems in a solid state configuration. Along with PVDF, PMMA has recently gained great interest for ECD and PECD applications due to its high transparency, excellent environmental stability, low-cost and high impact resistance. Efficient PMMA-based polymer electrolytes are typically prepared in gel form by dissolving them in plasticizing solvents, such as propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC) and γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL), with LiClO4 lithium salt.
However, better ion-transporting properties of gel and plasticized polymer electrolytes were gained at the expense of an overall reduction of their structural and mechanical properties. Conventional liquid or gel electrolytes, usually adopted for the fabrication of chromogenic devices, suffer from numerous drawbacks, such as a low stability, and a tendency to leak and evaporate, that strongly compromise the EC response as well as the long-term durability of the devices limiting their use in large-scale application. With this aim, a very promising approach has been the introduction of ionic liquids (ILs) embedded into polymers followed by their functionalization with oxide nanopowders. ILs, liquid molten salts at ambient temperature, generally constituted of quaternary ammonium cations, such as imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, pyperidinium, and inorganic or organic counteranions including tetrafluoroborate (BF4), hexafluorophosphate (PF6), bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (TFSI), are characterized by low volatility, negligible vapor pressure, non-flammability and exceptional chemico-physical properties with a wide electrochemical window (up to 5 V to 6 V). These main features render them very attractive for application in chromogenic smart windows. Numerous examples of functional EC devices using quasi-solid ILs and IL polymer-based electrolytes have been reported in the literature showing higher performance and superior long-term stability than those exploiting conventional gel polymer electrolytes. Recently, other interesting strategies have been adopted to improve the ion conducting properties of these electrolyte systems. Polymeric ionic liquids (PILs), constituted of ionic species covalently bonded with a polymer backbone (combining both the properties of ionic liquids with those of polyelectrolytes), were effectively prepared, exhibiting fast ion transport. Furthermore, Zhou and co-workers showed the possibility of using a low content of ILs (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetra-fluoroborate [BMIM]BF4−) in the polymer electrolyte composition based on cross-linked poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-co-HFP) nanofibrous mats, rendering these systems cheaper and more sustainable.
In addition to IL polymer electrolytes, another efficient approach adopted was to increase the overall stability of semi-solid electrolyte systems by introducing nanoparticles into the polymer matrix. Scrosati's group developed, for the first time, nanocomposite polymer electrolytes with both low-temperature conductive properties and excellent mechanical stability, demonstrating that nanoparticle ceramic fillers (TiO2, Al2O3) added to a mixture of PEO–LiClO4, acting as a solid plasticizer for PEO, kinetically inhibit crystallization upon annealing from the amorphous state above 60 °C. These nanocomposite electrolyte systems, used primarily for lithium batteries, were recently adopted in solid-state EC devices. Pehlivan et al. reported that the functionalization of polymer electrolytes based on PEI–lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) (LiTFSI) by the addition of 6% SiO2 nanoparticles (diameter 7 nm) by weight improved the structural stability as well as increasing the ion conductivity of the electrolyte layer and thereby enhanced the EC performance in terms of both switching time and cyclability. The salt concentration also played an important role in determining the ion conduction of these PEI:LiTFSI:SiO2 electrolytes showing a maximum value at a molar ratio of 100 (see Fig. 14).
In contrast to fumed silica nanoparticles, adding transparent conducting electrical nanoparticles of In2O3:Sn (ITO) (diameter 13 nm) into PEI–LiTFSI has the effect of absorbing near-infrared (NIR) light so that solar energy transmittance (Tsol) was strongly diminished while luminous transmittance (Tlum) was almost unaffected, without having a substantial effect on the ion conduction.
Natural polymers such as natural gelatins, and agar gels, commonly used in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic products, were also adopted as host matrices for the development of efficient gel polymer electrolytes with good chemico-physical properties, offering especially the advantages of being cheaper, eco-friendly and biodegradable. Another interesting class of polymer electrolytes employed in EC devices is polyelectrolytes, Nafion and its derivatives, usually used in fuel cells and in other electrochemical applications requiring an ion conducting polymer. Nafion's chemical structure consists of a perfluorinated backbone, conferring both mechanical and chemical stability, and perfluoroether side chains end-capped with sulfonic acid groups that are responsible for its exceptional proton-conduction properties. Furthermore, this polymer exhibits good optical properties and it is easily processable in transparent and homogeneous membranes. Recently, Kattouf et al. have focused their research activity on the enhancement of the electrode–polymer interface reporting a fast switching Nafion-based sandwich-type EC device, by blending Nafion with a highly porous sol–gel WO3 matrix. Tetralayer polyelectrolytes fabricated via layer by layer (LBL) assembly using linear poly(ethylene imine) (LPEI), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO) have also been explored by Hammond’s and Lee’s groups demonstrating the possibility to prepare flexible solid-state electrolyte systems for functional transmissive and reflective type EC devices.
Recent trends in the fabrication of effective solid-state chromogenic devices are motivated by the need to overcome the complicated and very expensive manufacturing processes associated with the assembly of a typical multilayer (5-layers) structure, in which a gel or quasi-solid electrolyte is interposed between two conductive glass substrates, typically clamped or stuck by using a few drops of the liquid electrolyte. These sealing procedures confer a strong functional and structural instability to the device since the leakage and evaporation of the solvent-based electrolytes can induce a lack of adherence between the two parts, determining irregular kinetics and a non-homogenous EC response as well as a remarkable negative impact on the long-term durability. Furthermore, a high-speed roll to roll (R2R) manufacturing process, typically employed for coatings of solid and dry polymer electrolytes, is incompatible for sticky and adhesive gel or semi-solid polymers. To overcome this problem the gel electrolyte layer could be UV-cured conferring a full solid-state configuration more suitable for slot-die coating. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by Jensen et al. with the development of a flexible full solid-state EC polymer device by using a photo-curable acrylate-based electrolyte and a silver grid electrode deposited respectively by slot-dye coating and flexographic printing (see Fig. 15).
Other effective approaches have been proposed to address the issues associated with liquid or semi-solid electrolytes. The fabrication of a simplified “single layer” chromogenic device by combining the electrolyte with the chromogenic polymer in a single layer and with the electrode layer represent effective strategies to avoid electrolyte leakage with a reduction of material waste and deposition steps. Cossari et al. demonstrated a monolithic system with a simplified architecture (substrate/ITO/WO3/Nafion/ITO) in which a suitable Nafion film (8 μm thick) tightly shares its interfaces with a WO3 layer and a highly transparent and conductive RF-sputtered ITO film. Percec et al. reported a single-layer all solid-state EC device architecture consisting of a film of a poly(epichlorohydrin-co-ethylene oxide) [poly(ECH-co-EO)] electrolyte with pendent carbazole groups, assembled between two transparent electrodes. Various chromophore groups can also be grafted to different polymer backbones, for example [poly(ECH-co-EO)], poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB), Na neutralized poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) or Surlyn®, tailoring thus the EC device properties. A different approach for a single layer EC film consisted in the synthesis by in situ oxidative or electrochemical polymerization of the conjugated polymers within the electrolyte matrix, forming a semi-interpenetrating solid network. Chevrot's group reported single layer EC films based on conducting polythiophenes synthesized by oxidative polymerization inside a cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate)/poly(ethylene glycol methacrylate), maintaining well separated the electrolyte and chromogenic components thus avoiding short circuits. Sotzing's group reported recently a similar strategy for the development of a single layer chromogenic film by photopolymerization of an acrylate functionalized low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in the presence of a photoinitiator, a lithium salt, a plasticizer (propylene carbonate), and a monomer. The best performance was obtained by using a biphenylmethyloxymethyl-3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (BPMOM-ProDOT) conducting polymer EC device, prepared by in situ UV curing followed by electrochemical polymerization of the electroactive monomer into the solid matrix (poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate) (PEG-DA), having a photopic contrast of 47% for a quasi-large area device (105 cm2). Further advancements in terms of long-term stability (10000 cycles) and optical modulation (48%) have been achieved by combining a ProDOT polymer modified with an acrylate group (ProDOT-Ac) with a cross-linkable polymer matrix (poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate) (PEG-DA) allowing simultaneously UV cross-linking of both the active layers and the gel electrolyte with the advantage of immobilizing the unreacted monomers preventing thus any degradative reaction in the electrode layer.

In the standard design of PECDs, the substrate is constituted by a transparent electrode working as an anode, extracting charge carriers from the absorbing layer. This layer is usually a glass support covered by a very thin TCO film. Noticeably this component represents the largest device cost. On the Gigawatt scale, glass covered with fluorine-doped tin oxide costs US$ 8–12 m−2, whereas uncoated glass costs US$ 5 m−2. The glass–glass recipient of a PECD would therefore cost at least US$ 13 m−2. Low-cost devices could be built from cheap plastic sheets to save glass costs, although stability issues are associated with the use of such substrates, which have significantly higher water vapour transport rates and thus allow moisture to ingress into the PECD. Researchers have yet to produce a plastic sheet that is cheaper than glass while also having an adequate water vapour transport rate. Furthermore, sputtered TCOs on plastics are more expensive, less transparent and more resistive than when deposited on glass, which provides lower performance levels. Generally speaking, TCOs suffer from significant limitations such as the cost of the fabrication process, scarcity (especially concerning indium based TCOs like In2O3:Sn (ITO)) and brittleness, even though they are very well adapted for some applications. On this front in the last few years numerous scientific investigations have been devoted to exploring a variety of other materials for the fabrication of thin layers exhibiting a good compromise between optical transparency and electrical conductivity: carbon nanotube networks (CNTs), graphene thin films, conducting polymers, metallic grids and metal nanowire networks. When selecting an appropriate material for an application it is crucial to consider the costs associated with the raw materials and production methods used to fabricate the electrode, and whether high-temperature or vacuum processes are required for, or incompatible with, device production and the specific needs of the application. From these considerations the most realistic current candidates, as alternative TCOs, are graphene thin films and silver nanowire networks.

In particular, the advent of graphene represents a significant advancement in this field, especially since the CVD approach has been used to synthesize single or few-layer graphene films. Interesting reviews, on this pivotal topic, were recently provided by Higgins et al. and by Jo et al. Gomez De Arco et al. reported continuous, highly flexible, and transparent graphene films produced by CVD as transparent conductive electrodes in organic solar cells. The efficiency of organic solar cells with a graphene electrode was 1.18%, which is close to that of organic solar cells with an ITO electrode (∼1.27%). In 2011, Wang et al. used a layer-by-layer transfer method to fabricate multilayer CVD graphene films with less defects and lower sheet resistance. The organic solar cells with the electrode of four layers graphene have an improved PCE of up to 2.5%, which is 83.3% of the PCE of ITO-based devices. For a hybrid solar cell, Wu et al. demonstrated the use of graphene as a transparent conductive electrode with the structure of graphene/organic/silicon, which has a PCE of 10%. TCO-free solar cells have also been fabricated with perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3), by using a graphene transparent anode and organic carrier transport materials. By adding a few nanometer-thick MoO3 layer, wettability and work function of the graphene electrode are enhanced to enable a 17.1% power conversion efficiency, which is the highest efficiency for TCO-free solar cells.

PECDs represent an intriguing class of “smart” devices, sensing even small changes in environmental parameters, such as irradiation, generating consequently a perceivable response. Given these premises, PECDs inspire optimistic expectations to design “intelligent” building envelopes, or “skins”, able to manage, in a smart fashion, the complex energy flow that passes through them. PECDs are also interesting due to their wide range of applications, ranging from architectural windows to information displays, energy conversion, sensors, energy storage, automotives and avionics. Dynamic tintable “smart windows” would have beneficial effects on building-integrated architectural glazings in terms of energy consumption attenuation and reduction of cooling loads or the demand for electric lighting. According to Pichot et al. in the summer season, from 10% to 15% of peak electric energy consumption in the USA is due to cooling of buildings with air conditioning systems, with an approximated cost of 10 billion dollars per year. The large number of reports dealing with PECDs and their complex architectures does not facilitate their systematic classification. Elsewhere, a criterion based on the mutual disposition of the light-sensitive layer and the chromogenic one was adopted. With this approach, PECDs were subdivided into three main groups: devices in which light sensitive and the chromogenic layers were separated; those in which they were successfully combined and those in which the active area of the light-sensitive layer was non symmetric to the EC layer. Other suitable sorting methods could be adopted, taking into account other peculiar aspects of PECDs. As it will be clarified in the following paragraphs, devices appearing so far in this field differ according to: the EC materials adopted, the PV technology exploited, the layout (disposition of the various layers), the mutual disposition of EC and PV layers and the device operation mode with respect to the presence of an external circuit (i.e. coloration under short-circuit or open-circuit conditions). Eventually, other effective sorting criteria could be based on the electrolyte adopted (liquid, gel or solid-state) or on the independent manageability of the device main features (photovoltaic conversion and optical transition). Noticeably, from these remarks, those devices that do not allow the exploitation of both functionalities in a unique device could not be considered PECDs.

We adopt here a simple chronological criterion to review the multiplicity of PECD designs. We rely on the fact that this criterion can be useful to identify clear trends in the design of devices and in the choice of materials, over a period of almost twenty years. For instance, it will be possible to recognize the heavy influence of the PV technology adopted. We hope that this critical review could be a useful tool for those who might need to get a clear idea of the current trends in the field of multifunctional smart window design and suitable characterization methods. In fact, PECDs generally undergo complete electro-optical experimental characterization, aiming at identifying the main figures of merit typically used in the field of PV cells as well as in the field of EC devices.

In their seminal letter to Nature, Bechinger et al. described the first PECD that, unlike conventional photochromic films, embedded a PV film separated from the electrochrome. The device contained a ruthenium sensitized nanocrystalline titanium dioxide photoelectrode and a tungsten oxide layer deposited by thermal evaporation on the counter electrode (Fig. 16). The former, acting as a light-absorber, produced an open circuit voltage of 0.6–0.9 V, which was a sufficient driving force to move electrons into the WO3 film, under short-circuit conditions, attracting lithium ions in its octahedral structure and thus activating the redox reaction at the basis of the reversible coloration process.

They also reported pictures of a 25 cm2 device showing an open circuit memory of 24 h and a complete coloration after 100 s, when exposed to chopped white light (75 mW cm−2).
Brian Gregg highlighted the similarity between DSSC and PECDs, maximizing the cell photovoltage by lowering the iodine content within the electrolyte. He also adopted a more transparent dye, in order to reduce the overall device absorbance and gave interesting clues about the possibility of tuning the optical properties of devices by selecting suitable dyes. In 1998, Li et al. proposed a similar “separated” architecture for PECDs, adopting polyaniline (PANI) as an anodic EC material, showing fast but weak modulation of the transmitted light intensity (5.1% average change of visible light under white light illumination). The short-circuit current (0.37 mA cm−2) and the open-circuit voltage (0.416 V) allowed a decoloration of the PANI layer due to the PV conversion activated on the dye-sensitized photoelectrode. In fact, when the device was short-circuited, electrons moved from titanium dioxide to PANI via the external circuit and the chromogenic film was reduced (and bleached), passing from a colored emeraldine salt state to a decolored leucoemeraldine salt state. Reduction took place in 2 or 3 s because it was driven by the internal electric field, whereas the oxidation, which is a diffusion-controlled process, took place in about 35 s.
Based on the same design Pichot et al. reported the first demonstration of a solid-state PEC window deposited on flexible polymer substrates (ITO-coated polyester), adopting a low temperature deposition process of titanium dioxide colloidal films. Sotomayor et al. reported supramolecular assemblies based on modified transparent nanostructured titanium dioxide (anatase) membranes. These assemblies consisted of covalently linked titanium dioxide nanocrystals, a ruthenium complex and a viologen component. It was then possible to figure out the direction of light-induced electron transfer within the heterosupramolecular assembly. Exposure of these membranes to light determined the blue coloration, whereas the application of a negative potential caused a prolonged persistence of coloration. This design approach was an interesting attempt to design a multifunctional photoelectrode for DSSCs, by adding an EC feature to the light-harvesting properties of ruthenium-sensitized TiO2 nanostructured films.

An important architectural turning point was disclosed by Hauch et al. with a new PECD showing several architectural novelties: the photoactive (TiO2) layer was deposited directly onto the EC layer (WO3), thus sharing the same electrode (Fig. 17).

They reported the activation of the coloration mechanism under open-circuit conditions (under 1 Sun illumination), consisting in a measured change of 1 in the optical density, with time kinetics of about 2 min (for colouring and bleaching). This device represented an evolution of the previous design as the bleaching process was accelerated by a platinum catalyst, independent of the coloration process. The thin catalyst layer was deposited on the counter electrode. This was the first demonstration of a “combined” PECD architecture, with reference to the mutual disposition of the EC and light-absorbing layers. At open circuit, and under illumination, electrons were injected into the titanium dioxide and from there, they attracted lithium ions and caused coloration. Under short-circuit conditions, electrons were transferred from the WO3 layer to the platinum electrode, causing the regeneration of I− ions inside the electrolyte. A concomitant lithium deintercalation from WO3 took place, determining bleaching of the device.
In 2002 Hauch et al. compared three different design configurations for PECDs. The WO3 layer was deposited, respectively, beneath and upon the titanium dioxide layer or, in a further design approach, on the counter electrode. For the given preparation method adopted for titanium dioxide and WO3, which was the sol–gel method, the best performing architecture was TCO/WO3/TiO2/electrolyte/Pt/TCO, showing a modulation of 46.2% and quite fast kinetics (3 min for coloring and bleaching). Another interesting comparison was undertaken by Liao et al. foreseeing PEDOT as a cathodic EC material. The conducting polymer was electropolymerized onto ITO coated glasses. Then, an aqueous suspension containing titanium dioxide nanoparticles was spin-coated onto PEDOT and dried in air (combined architecture). In a second device configuration (separated architecture), PEDOT was deposited on the counter electrode (Fig. 18). An optical modulation of 20–22% was achieved (630 nm) and a coloration efficiency as high as 280 cm2 C−1.
Krasovec et al. reported a solid-state device based on the “combined architecture”, using a solid lithium ion conductor, based on organically modified silane containing an iodine/iodide redox couple. The coloring process was activated under open-circuit conditions and illumination. After light excitation of dye molecules, electrons were injected into WO3 (800 nm) via the titanium dioxide layer (100 nm). Both of the layers were deposited by spin-coating. At the same time, lithium ions were intercalated into WO3 and I− was oxidized to I3−. Bleaching took place under short-circuit conditions. Electrons were transferred from the WO3 to platinum electrode, causing the regeneration of I− ions in the electrolyte medium. The system demonstrated high stability (after 50 days) and an optical modulation of 60% in the visible range (under 1 Sun) irradiation. Coloration and bleaching times were observed to be 15 minutes. Georg et al. reported important advancements in the same architectural paradigm: they designed a solid-state electrolyte, which enhanced the open-circuit memory of the coloured device (100 h), even though it was at the expense of fast kinetics because full coloration was observed only after 15 min. Further, it was the first time that a PV characteristic curve was reported for PECDs, thus envisaging the possibility to exploit these devices not only for their responsive transmittance modulation, but also for energy generation via PV conversion, though their conversion efficiency was quite low (η = 0.054%). De Filpo et al. reported a diverse approach, demonstrating the possibility to exploit the photoelectrochromic properties of methylene blue (MB) in a flexible device, fabricated on polyethylene substrates (PETs). The active MB molecules were bonded to titanium dioxide nanospheres. The device could bleach when illuminated as a consequence of the reaction between the triplet state of the MB molecules and the electron donor triethylamine molecules. Transmittance passed from roughly 0.0% to 57% in 20 s.
Nokki et al. demonstrated another attempt to combine EC and PV properties in a unique PECD architectural design. Their approach consisted in a double sensitization of titanium dioxide with a ruthenium-based dye for light harvesting and with a viologen exploited for its EC properties. A transmittance modulation of 23% (at 675 nm) was observed in devices containing 6 μm thick titanium dioxide photoelectrodes and a PV efficiency of 1.1% in devices embodying 3 μm thick photoelectrodes. In the same year, Lanzo et al. reported preliminary results on trifunctional devices based on nematic emulsions, hosting electrochromic and photochromic guest molecules.
In 2008, Hsu et al. fabricated a PECD using an EC polymer thin film, poly(3,3-diethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno-[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine) (PProDot-Et2), and a dye-sensitized titanium dioxide. This device was capable of producing electric energy (like a DSSC) and of undergoing color modulation because of the electron transfer reaction at the interface between PProDot-Et2 and the electrolyte. See Section 3.1 for more details.

In 2009, Wu et al. introduced the first ever photovoltachromic devices (PVCDs), i.e. solar cells combining the photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized cells and the photoelectrochromic properties of the initial Bechinger's separated architecture (Fig. 19). A patterned WO3/Pt counter electrode allowed the design of a frame-type layout. With this device, under short-circuit conditions under light irradiation, the PVCD showed very fast coloration (4 s), and fair PV characteristics (η = 0.50%). A fast bleaching time was also demonstrated (about 40 s), due to the presence of the Pt catalyst. PVCDs could be bleached under illumination by simply opening the circuit. A control of transmittance modulation, even under short-circuit conditions under light irradiation was demonstrated, by adopting resistors in series, showing different values of resistance (from 2.5 Ω to 800 Ω).

Leftheriotis et al. reported PECDs in the so-called “combined” Hauch’s architecture, with a specific optimization of the single materials employed in the fabrication of devices. A high quality WO3 film (400 nm) deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by e-beam evaporation was used as a cathodic EC material, onto which 300 nm thick dye-sensitized nanostructured titanium dioxide was deposited. Finally, a highly transparent electrodeposited Pt layer was deposited on the counter electrode. The PECD showed a coloration time of 12 min under sunlight irradiation and transmittance modulation expressed by a contrast ratio of 3.6:1. They also discussed some of the general properties of PECDs: the coloration kinetics did not depend on the device surface area, but only on the internal electric field generated by the PV unit. Therefore, coloration times observed in laboratory cells could also be applicable to large-area windows. Moreover, they observed that, with appropriate combination of layers and materials, various colors could be obtained during coloration.
In 2010, De Filpo et al. in a short communication, described a single glass self-supplied PECD, that, in spite of its all-solid solid nature, showed very fast kinetics (coloration in 8 s and bleaching in 30 s). Such relevant and, somewhat surprising results were explained as an effect of the incorporation of single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) bearing carboxyl groups (COOH−) in the titanium dioxide and tungsten oxide films, increasing the uniformity of layers, their electrical conductivity and electron transfer through the films.
An innovative design for PVCDs was proposed by some of us in 2010, using specifically designed counter electrodes, showing a C-shaped platinum frame bound by a square WO3 region: the two areas were electrically separated, in order to make possible distinct operations on the two available external circuitries (Fig. 20). This unconventional counter electrode design allowed a twofold outcome: smart control of optical transmittance modulation and, at the same time, a dramatic increase of photovoltaic efficiency with respect to previous PECDs reported in the literature (η = 6.55%).
These devices also underwent a thorough electrochemical investigation, which provided interesting insights into the device operating modes, eventually showing that full coloration did not affect – negatively – the PV performances of the device, when operating in full photovoltachromic mode (Fig. 21).
Jiao et al. reported a PECD composed of dye-sensitized nanocrystalline titanium dioxide with PB deposited on the counter electrode: under illumination the PB bleached and it could be recolored by applying an appropriate external voltage (Fig. 22). The bleaching time (at 1 Sun) was 6.2 s and the coloration time was as low as 0.6 s for a corresponding transmittance modulation of 70% at 780 nm.
Another demonstration of the successful “decoupling” of PV and electronic elements in a suitably designed frame-type layout was reported by Leftheriotis et al. in 2012, with a “partly covered” device containing opaque (5 μm) titanium dioxide instead of highly transparent photoelectrodes with lower efficiencies. Then, only a fraction of the tungsten oxide area was covered. Such devices showed high transparency in the visible region and a coloration time of 3 min, with a contrast ratio of 10.2:1. Various titanium dioxide to WO3 area ratios were reported, ranging from 0.23 to 0.48, showing that the speed of coloration decreased, accordingly, without affecting the final degree of coloration.
A completely different approach to conveniently combine a PV and an EC device was demonstrated by Huang et al. with their multifunctional device including stripes of a semi-transparent silicon film solar cells and an ethyl-viologen-based EC solution, sandwiched between the solar cells and a secondary non-conductive substrate (Fig. 23).
When sunlight entered the device, the silicon-based cells generated electron–hole pairs. The photo-potential difference between the anode and cathode induced a redox reaction in the EC solution, due to the creation of an ionic current. Thus, coloration took place (ΔT 70% at 590 nm) with a coloration time of 200 s. When sunlight declined, the device could easily restore its transparency due to its self-bleaching properties.
Yang et al. proposed a PECD showing a poly(3,4-(2,2-dimethyl-propylenedioxy)thiophene) (PProDOT-Me2) EC film integrated in a DSSC (Fig. 24). In this case, the thin catalyst layer of platinum (Pt) was deposited – on the counter electrode – beneath the EC layer, allowing the attainment of fast response times (1 s in coloration and 4 s in bleaching) and an optical contrast of 38%.
This fact was clearly demonstrated showing the highly porous structure of PProDOT-Me2, containing nanofibers with diameters of approximately 30–50 nm. As a consequence, the electrolyte could easily pass across the EC film and reach the Pt layer below, which could exert its beneficial catalytic function. The device was cathodically colored under short-circuit conditions, under illumination, when electrons reached (and reduced) the PProDOT-Me2 film, flowing through the external circuit. Once the transient EC phenomenon was complete, the dye molecules kept on generating electrons in the titanium dioxide photoanode. The PV performances were also measured (VOC = 0.66 V; JSC = 2.92 mA cm−2; η = 1.12%).
Huang et al. demonstrated the structure of a solid-type PV and EC device consisting of planarly distributed semi-transparent stripes of thin film solar cells with exposed anode layers in between. A PB film was electrochemically deposited and a LiClO4/PMMA/PC electrolyte was then deposited on the full area of the device. The electronic current generated by silicon thin film solar cell was transformed into an ionic current in the electrolyte layer, migrating transversely along the electrodes of the solar cell, in order to maintain charge neutrality in the EC system. Modulations of 55% at 690 nm were measured. Such an impressive anodic coloration occurred in 30 s.
Recently, we proposed a comb-like pattern for a bi-functional counter electrode, consisting of two physically separated series of stripes made of tungsten oxide and Pt layers, respectively, resulting from the combination of physical vapor deposition and lithography-based microfabrication processes. Under illumination, the generated photovoltage drove electrons into the EC stripes (PEC circuit), promoting lithium intercalation with very fast coloration (2 s) and bleaching (5 s) times. The PV circuit enabled a fair solar energy conversion efficiency, especially depending on the dye adopted and on the WO3/Pt area ratio. An orange organic dye and an N719 commercial dye were then compared. Devices embodying these sensitizers showed similar results but the optical performances were better in those containing the organic dye, especially for building integration purposes.
Xie et al. assembled a self-powered smart window by integrating a WO3·H2O film synthesized via a solution process and the photo-absorbing layers of a DSSC, deposited by screen-printing. They demonstrated two types of devices: a double-pole double-throw switch allowed the control of reversible changes of colour under light irradiation (Fig. 25). With a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, a switching time of 30 s was observed at a wavelength of 670 nm, giving an optical modulation of 26%. They also investigated the energy storage properties of possible further architectures.
One more energy harvesting EC window was conceived as a profitable fusion of an organic EC device and a solar cell in a separated PECD architecture. It contained an electropolymerized poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT-Et2) film and a sensitized TiO2 electrode, a robust combination contributing to high cyclic stability. Highly transparent electrolytes, based on a cobalt redox couple, were preferred to typical iodine/iodide, adopted in similar devices. A conversion efficiency of 4.5% (1 Sun – AM 1.5) and a change in transmittance of 34% (with 1 s switching time) upon applying the potential were demonstrated.
Malara et al. renewed the typical dual architecture of PECDs (separated/combined configurations), splitting the patterned counter electrode of previous PVCDs into two distinct counter electrodes, physically overlapped: a central one covered by a very thin Pt layer acting as a catalyzer for the PV circuit, and a second WO3 EC electrode. The photoanode was a film of titanium dioxide nanorods (1 cm2) sensitized by a transparent organic dye. The two distinct circuitries allowed three possible device operations: PV, PEC, PVC. The best PV performances (2.75%) were achieved in devices with the smallest size of communication windows.
Spray coating and slot-die coating were the techniques used by Jensen et al. who fabricated flexible EC devices based on conjugated electroactive polymers: poly((2,2-bis(2-ethylhexyloxymethyl)-propylene-1,3-dioxy)-3,4-thiophene-2,5-diyl) and poly(N-octadecyl-(propylene-1,3-dioxy)-3,4-pyrrole-2,5-diyl). They demonstrated the feasibility, but also the high contrast ratio and relatively fast response times achieved by means of a combination of EC polymers with cured and adhesive electrolytes (Fig. 27). Transmittance modulations of 44% with switch times of 5 s were observed and a bias of +2 V/−2 V with a very low current (<100 μA cm−2), pairing well with the electric output of the printed polymer PV module. A net-energy positive device was demonstrated by Dyer et al. producing electricity and capable of modulating incoming light and heat. The EC and PV components share common transparent conducting polymer electrodes. The approach has foreseen solution processing of the materials at room temperature thus promising for the manufacturing of possible large-area roll-to-roll devices. Device operation between colored and bleached states was achieved by connecting appropriate PV and EC electrodes. The different electrodes were suitably laminated in the vertical integration of solution processed polymeric materials. Highly transparent PV films were based on high band gap organic polymers. The EC polymers were PProDOT–(CH2OEtHx)2, referred to as ECP-magenta, and PProDOPN–C18H37, referred to as MCCP. ECP-magenta switched from a highly transparent state to a highly absorptive magenta state upon reduction, while MCCP only provided charge balance within the device, with minimal color changes. (See also Sections 2.1 and 3.1 for more details on this device.)
Yang et al. fabricated a PVCD using a solvent-free PEG–titanium hybrid polymer electrolyte, to fill a device with a frame-like WO3/Pt counter electrode and a N719-sensitized titanium dioxide nanoparticle photoelectrode (Fig. 26). A transmittance modulation of 50% (788 nm) with corresponding low switching times was observed (coloration, 6 s; bleaching, 17 s) in these very stable devices, successfully exposed to 91 day durability tests. It was an interesting approach towards solvent-free polymer electrodes for PVCDs.
Recently some of us proposed a semi-transparent perovskite PV film with a solid polymer electrolyte-based EC device to achieve a solid PVCD, fabricated by depositing the photovoltaic and EC layers onto separated glass sheets. The top glass had both sides coated with TCOs, working as separated electrodes. On the other hand, the bottom glass has only one conductive layer, with e-beam deposited WO3 on top. A solid polymer electrolyte, based on polyethylene oxide plasticized by means of PEG, acted as an effective electrolyte for the EC part of the device as well as a suitable “glue” to laminate the two glass substrates (Fig. 27). The PV layer showed high transmittance, due to the customized dewetting of the perovskite islands, allowing the formation of discrete micron-sized islands. A PV conversion efficiency of 5.5% and an optical modulation of 26% were observed in these devices. The optical modulation in the EC circuit was activated profiting from the high energy output produced by the planar heterojunction photovoltaic film. In this way, a self-activated tinting could be enabled according to the available irradiation, with the additional possibility of delivering external power, depending on the external circuitry connections.
A self-powered smart window has also recently been developed by Wu et al., in which an EC device containing two complementary inorganic materials (anodic NiO and cathodic WO3) was activated by a multiple InGaN/GaN quantum well solar cell. At 1 Sun, the maximum transmittance during coloration and bleaching were, respectively, 10.8% and 77.39%, with coloration and bleaching times of 8 s and 5 s.

The primary function of electrolyte systems in PECDs based on DSSCs as a power supply is to allow internal electric charge transport in order to balance any external electron flow and provide fast ion conduction for the EC active layer. Therefore, in addition to a lithium salt, the electrolyte contains a redox couple for internal charge transfer reaction of the dye sensitizers. Most of them are in liquid form, and typically consist of redox couple I−/I3−, the LiI salt and additives dissolved in organic solvents. A nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound, such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP), is the most common additive used to improve both the VOC and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), thus determining an overall enhancement of the PECD performance. As for liquid solvents, cyclic carbonates such as propylene carbonate (PC) and ethylene carbonate (EC), or a mixture of PC with an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile (ACN) (4:1 by volume) are mostly used due to their high dielectric constants that ensure high salt dissociation and additive dissolution.

In the case of PECDs based on conducting polymer materials as EC layers, optical modulation and coloration/bleaching kinetics were found to be strongly influenced by the electron transfer reaction at the electrolyte (couple redox)/conducting polymer interface. Hsu et al. reported a separated-type PECD fabricated by interposing an electrolyte of 0.1 M redox couples and 0.1 M LiClO4 in high boiling point 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) between a PProDot-Et2 EC film and the organic photosensitive dye, a FL dye1–TiO2 photoactive layer. They found that in the presence of the redox couple, the electron transfer reaction at the electrolyte/PProDot-Et2 conducting polymer interface determined the electrochromism of the PECD. The rate constants of the electron transfer (k0) for different redox couples at the PProDot-Et2 film, obtained by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were correlated with the coloration depth of the thin film. Since I−/I3− and Br−/Br3− couples possess the highest and the lowest k0 value, respectively, the PECD was investigated using these two redox couples under constant light illumination of 50 mW cm−2.The I−/I3− couple provided a higher short circuit current density (JSC) when acting as a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), thus the switching response upon coloration (a few seconds) was much faster than that of the PECD using the Br−/Br3− couple (about 2 min). In contrast, the PECD using Br−/Br3− exhibited a larger transmittance attenuation of ca. 33.7%, in comparison to that obtained using I−/I3− (14.1%).
Some of us investigated the effect of the electrolyte composition on both the photoelectrochromic and PV performances of the above referred devices by systematically tuning the iodide content in the electrolyte while keeping the lithium iodide concentration constant (0.7 M) (see Table 1). The best result was obtained by filling the cell with an iodine concentration of 0.005 M (EL5): a coloration efficiency of 61.10 cm2 C−1 at a wavelength of 780 nm and, at the same time, a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 6.55% has been reported. In fact, by adding 0.5 M TBP to an EL3 electrolyte solution, the EL5 based device showed, as expected, a significant increment of both the open circuit voltage (0.74 V) and the fill factor (0.72), since this additive gives rise to a negative shift of the TiO2 conduction band (reduces the recombination rate between the injected electrons in TiO2, and I3−) thus generating an increase of the cell photovoltage (Fig. 28).

Nowadays, the realization of solid-state PECDs represents an emerging challenge towards multifunctional systems with benefits in terms of reduced cost, environmental impact and safety. One of the main obstacles to the fabrication of more desirable solid systems lies in the replacement of conventional liquid electrolytes with solid-state ones. Numerous attempts have been made so far to prepare effective solid electrolytes to satisfy the specific architectural configuration of the device and the functional requirements of both the EC and PV components. Pichot et al. reported a flexible PECD constituted of a cross-linked polymer electrolyte, a ruthenium dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a 500 nm thick WO3 EC counter electrode, adopting a separated PECD configuration where the electrolyte was interposed between the EC active layer and the DSSC. More in detail, this gel polymer electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.5 M of LiI in poly(ethylene glycol-400) di-methacrylate (PEG-DMA) and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) exhibiting good optical, ion conductive as well as adhesive properties. Recently, Hechavarria et al. described a quasi-solid state PECD with a separated type architecture fabricated by interposing a hybrid electrolyte system, based on a solvent free PEG–titanium composite electrolyte, between the photoanode, a ruthenium 535 dye (N3)-sensitized TiO2 sol–gel deposited on an ITO substrate (DSSC), and an electrochemically deposited WO3 thin film on conductive ITO coated glass as an EC electrode. The polymer electrolyte was prepared by the sol–gel method using viscous polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 600) and titanium isopropoxide as precursors in an acidic medium (conc. HCl). A lithium salt (LiI) was finally added to PEG and the PEG–Ti hybrid system at a lithium salt content of n = 8, i.e. ether–oxygen to lithium [EO]:[Li+] molar ratio of 8:1. The resulting highly transparent and fast ion conductive composite electrolyte led to a remarkable improvement of the coloration kinetics and an overall increase of the PEC stability. EIS analyses of PECDs under illumination in open circuit (before coloring) and after illumination at rest potential (after coloring) showed that the presence of a titanium complex in polymer electrolytes reduced the charge transfer resistance and increased the charge storage capacity of the cells, as illustrated in the Nyquist plots of Fig. 29.
This improvement came from the oxidation of iodides and the reduction of titanium ions inside the composite polymer electrolytes that increased the lithium ion's mobility under the applied electrical field. A PVDF copolymer based-gel electrolyte containing succinonitrile (SN), LiClO4 salt and the Br−/Br3− redox couple dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC) was also adopted in quasi solid-state PECDs with a separated type configuration, Fig. 30. Briefly, the device architecture can be represented as FTO/TiO2–FLdye1/gel electrolyte/PProDOT-Et2/ITO, where the gel electrolyte was sandwiched between the DSSC and the chromogenic (semiconducting polymer) active layer (EC cell). In this case, Wu et al. investigated the influence of the gel polymer electrolyte crystallinity on the ion conduction properties and device performances by blending PVDF–HFP with different concentrations of SN. In detail, the electrolytes were composed of 0.5 M tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBABr) and 0.1 M LiClO4 in PC with 5 wt% PVDF–HFP (electrolyte P) or in SN (electrolyte S). To prepare composite electrolytes, PxSy, electrolytes P and S were mixed in a volume ratio of x:y (7:1, 6:2, 5:3). By adding SN to the PVDF–HFP/PC electrolyte, the nucleus size of PVDF–HFP in the composite was reduced, suppressing the crystallinity of the polymer electrolytes. The inhibition of crystal growth was ascribed to a reduction of the effective space available for the primary nucleation in the composite resulting in an increment of ionic conductivity, diffusion coefficient and a consequent fast switching rate of the PECDs. A bleaching time larger than 100 s was reported for the PECDs fabricated with electrolytes based on SN or PVDF–HFP alone, while the devices using the gel electrolytes obtained by blending SN with PVDF–HFP/PC showed a shorter bleaching rate. After measuring the conductivity and the diffusion coefficient, the optimal condition for the gel electrolyte was found to be P6S2, which was also confirmed by a bleaching time of less than 30 s (20–35 s) and a coloring time of 3 s. Moreover, the corresponding PECD also exhibited a photocurrent density (JSC) of 0.164 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.48 and a VOC of 0.75 V, which was sufficient to drive a high coloration efficiency material, such as PProDOT-Et2.
De Filpo et al. described an all solid-state PECD with a combined structure where the dye sensitized/TiO2 and the chromogenic layer (layer of WO3 nanoparticles), both doped with single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) bearing COOH groups, were deposited on the same electrode. In this case, a solid electrolyte PEDOT film was adopted to replace the conventional liquid or jellified electrolytes. Acting either as mixed ion or as electronic conductors, this conducting polymer allowed both proton intercalation into the WO3 layer and an easier repopulation of the dye HOMO level by electron transfer from the ITO electrode. As a matter of fact, such a conductive polymer layer played the role of an electrical contact between the dye–TiO2 (functionalized with SWNTs) layer and the ITO counter electrode, promoting the electron transfer from the TCO to the dye and at the same time, conferring a solid-state PECD configuration since no fluid or jellified electrolytic solutions were used. Krasovec et al. demonstrated, for the first time, a quasi-large area PECD with a size of 5 × 5 cm2 and 10 × 10 cm2. In this case, a combined architecture was proposed by interposing a solid electrolyte based on organic modified silane (ormolyte) with a redox couple between a highly porous, nanostructured ruthenium dye/TiO2 WO3 layer (photoelectrochromic electrode) and a Pt/counterelectrode (TCO) layer. They investigated the influence of both ormolytes and ormolytes/cationic surfactants (additives) on the PECD performance. To prepare these hybrid (organic–inorganic) electrolyte systems, equimolar amounts of 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane and O,O-bis(2-aminopropylpolyethyleneglycol) (ME ≈ 4000 g mol−1) were reacted to form a precursor composed of poly(propylene)oxide bis-endcapped with triethoxysilane groups. LiI salt (0.5 M) and I2 (5 mM) were added to the precursor/ethanol mixture and finally the gelation process (hydrolysis/condensation reactions) was catalyzed by acetic acid (AcOH). As for ormolyte/cationic surfactant based solid electrolytes, dodecyl acid (cationic surfactant) was added to ormosil in a mass ratio (surfactant/ormosil) of 1:3 to prove its effect on the stability and performance of devices. By comparing these ormolyte-based electrolytes, the addition of the cationic surfactant to the ormolyte led to a better penetration of the electrolyte into the pores of the WO3/TiO2 layers and suppressed the shrinkage of the electrolyte resulting in a better stability of the cells (Fig. 31). Furthermore, the presence of larger cations (additive) in the electrolyte increased VOC (under 1 Sun illumination), due to the reduced amount of cations adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface with a less significant shift of the semiconductor band edges, and thus limiting loss reactions in the PEC devices. As a result, deeper coloration (higher charged inserted into the WO3 layer) and a longer memory effect were achieved for the PECD with the ormolyte/surfactant electrolyte. The best of the large area devices showed optical modulation varying from 62% (bleached state) to about 1.8% (colored state), with a stability up to 50 days and bleaching and coloring times of about 15 minutes.
In our recent report, we proposed a solid state perovskite-based PECD in which a polymer electrolyte constituted of high molecular weight PEO, LiI and PEG was used as a glue to laminate two layered glasses (EC and PV active layers) and complete the EC cell. The PEO:PEG:LiI electrolyte was prepared with an ether–oxygen to lithium [EO]:[Li+] molar ratio of 4:1, whereas the PEO:PEG weight ratio was fixed as 40:60.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometric analysis (CA) after 300 cycles and 10000 cycles, respectively, demonstrated a good electrochemical reversibility, stability and long-term durability of these plasticized polymer electrolytes. Before and after 104 charge/discharge cycles of the EC device, the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes showed a decrease from the initial value of 1.25 × 10−5 S cm−1 to a final value of 1.40 × 10−6 S cm−1 and at the same time, the injected charge density decreased from 2.4 mC cm−2 to 1.2 mC cm−2. As a result, the reduction of charge absorption induced a consequent decrease of the transparency modulation. This performance decay (after 104 cycles) was correlated with the lower ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and the sheet resistance increase of the ITO electrodes in contact with acidic electrolytes (see Fig. 32).
Xie et al. reported a self-powered smart window designed with an integrated EC device and a DSSC device for energy saving and energy storage applications. In this integrated device, two different electrolytes were effectively used. A gel polymer electrolyte based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with concentrated H2SO4 (1 M) for the EC device and a liquid electrolyte consisting of 1,2-dymethyl-3-propylimidazolinium iodide (DMPII) (1 M), lithium iodide (LiI) (0.1 M), I2 (0.12 M) and 4-TBP (0.5 M) in methoxypropionitrile for the DSSC device.
Similarly, as already discussed Jensen et al. utilized polymer solar cells (OPVs) to drive EC display devices. In this case, EC polymers and a PMMA based quasi-solid electrolyte (PMMA/ionic liquid electrolyte system) were used for the fabrication of a fully printable and laminated device on flexible substrates. A suitable processing of the ion gel electrolyte, prepared by radical polymerization of vinyl monomer, methyl methacrylate (MMA), in ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-2-methyl-imidazolium-bis(triflouromethane sulfonyl)imide (EMIM-TFSI), in the presence of a small amount of cross linker, gave highly transparent, flexible and free-standing films. In addition, given its good adhesive properties it was also used as a sealant in a mixture with a binder to complete the EC device thus avoiding the use of double-sided adhesive or toxic linear epoxy resin. Further advancement of all-polymeric PECDs was reported by Dyer et al. see Fig. 33.
To assemble a fully integrated EC/PV device (see in Section 2.1 for further details), an ion conducting gel polymer electrolyte, consisting of PMMA (8 wt%) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) (0.5 M) in propylene carbonate (PC), was deposited between two separated EC layers (ECP magenta and MCCP) and eventually laminated and sealed.
In addition to polymer electrolytes, thin solid films of inorganic metal oxide have been effectively used as solid electrolytes for the realization of all inorganic solid-state PECDs with a multilayer tandem structure where the silicon solar cell is separated and is parallel with the EC cell.
Gao et al. and Deb et al. reported a monolithic PECD architecture in which the EC active layers are deposited on top of the photovoltaic layer. In detail, such an integrated structure was constituted of a wide band gap a-Si1−xCx/H n–i–p PV cell as a semitransparent power source and a LiyWO3/LiAlF4/V2O5 EC device as an optical-transmittance modulator. In this configuration, a thin inorganic ion conductor film (1000 nm thickness) of lithium aluminum fluoride (LiAlF4) was deposited by thermal evaporation on the chromogenic layer of WO3 starting from a mixture of lithium fluoride (LiF) and aluminum fluoride (AlF3) powder. Finally, the device was sealed to prevent the hygroscopic-lithiated Li1.2V2O5 (ion storage medium) layer from absorbing water vapor from the air. Compared with polymer electrolytes, inorganic solid-state Li-ion conductors exhibited many advantages such as superior electrochemical, mechanical and thermal stability, the absence of leakage, and material safety. Therefore, replacing the quasi-solid electrolyte (gel or plasticized polymer electrolytes) with an inorganic solid-state ion conductor could represent a relevant option for the development and manufacturing of large area PECDs with a high reliability degree as well as environmental stability. In this context, some interesting examples of all-inorganic chromogenic devices were reported in the literature, where tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) and more recently, lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) thin films were effectively prepared by physical vapor deposition as high performance solid ion-conductors for ECD integration in a multilayer architecture.

A summary of the most important PECD figures of merit, discussed within this review and in particular in Sections 2.5 and 3.1, is reported in Table 2.

Adaptive facade technologies, and therefore PECDs used as a smart glazing, can contribute to the complex challenge of reducing buildings' energy demand and, thus, their environmental footprint. Nevertheless, users' interaction and control strategies should be carefully assessed due to the high impact of such devices on energy consumption. A survey conducted among experts in the field assessed the potential performance of EC devices for building integration. Spectral response in terms of both solar and visible control, cyclic lifetime, overall lifetime, and switching time were among the considered indexes.

The survey concluded that a smart window should be able to switch its Visible Light Transmittance (VLT) from 50–70% in the bleached state to less than 10–20% in the colored one. However experiments involving human subjects have demonstrated that the minimum acceptable glazing VLT is in the range of 25–38%, depending on sky conditions. Most of the PEC devices so far developed show transmittance values in the coloured state in the range between 10% and 30%, if wavelengths in the visible bandwidths are considered, demonstrating thus good potential for building integration.
The VLT dynamic gradient can greatly contribute to increased indoor visual comfort. Piccolo and Simone demonstrated that in sun-oriented windows (south for the northern hemisphere) an overall VLT dynamic range of 54% reduces the glare probability, without compromising daylight availability. However, in west and east oriented windows very low transmissions in the coloured state (i.e. lower than 7%) are necessary to control solar radiation with lower angles. PECD technology has demonstrated to be mature under this viewpoint as several prototypes show light transmittance modulations higher than 50% in the visible bandwidths. Furthermore, some devices reached very low transmittances, compatible with their use in west and east oriented rooms. Some of us showed that integration of PVCDs in windows could significantly improve control of solar radiation. We predicted, in fact, an increase of the Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI – i.e. the percentage of time in which indoor daylight illuminance is within the comfort band) of up to about 72% as an average value in a standard office room. An additional reported benefit was the reduction of intolerable glare to less than 12% of occupied hours.
Visual comfort and glare are not the only factors influencing users' attitude towards switchable technologies. Zinzi carried out an experimental study involving 30 human subjects in order to understand the users' acceptance of EC windows. The author found that more than 85% of users do not perceive any significant alteration of both the indoor and outdoor environment due to the colouring of the window. In contrast, 40% of them perceive the visual obstruction of external blinds as bothering. The automatic control of the colour gradient is preferred by only 37% of users. This poses a significant problem in the development of colour-changing technologies, as manual override should be a major feature. As discussed by Bechinger and Gregg, pioneers of PECD technology, as the coloration process requires the presence of an electric field between the two electrodes, each state (either transparent or coloured) can be manually stored or changed. Therefore, even if the major property of PECDs is the automatic control of their transparency, this feature can be overridden when desired. As an example, Hauch et al. proposed to change the device transmittance during illumination in a continuous manner, using an adjustable external resistance. Similarly, Su proposed to manually control a solid-state PECD by changing the resistance in an external circuit. Georg et al. explained the kinetics of a newly developed PEC window. The device was able to colour or bleach if illuminated, by adjusting the electrolyte. Alternatively, under dark conditions the device was still able to act as a traditional EC cell, changing its transparency with the application of an external voltage.
Climate-adaptable technologies applied to building envelopes could have a positive impact on the reduction of building energy consumption. A study carried out by Tavares et al. demonstrated that switchable windows can be preferred to traditional technologies (like Double Glass Units) if cooling needs of sun-oriented (south, west and east) facades are considered. However previous studies demonstrated that strategies for determining the transition between bleached and coloured states have to be carefully assessed, due to their impact on total building energy demand. While, on one side, a dark state positively influences the cooling energy demand, on the other side, it could negatively affect lighting and heating consumption. Favoino et al. carried out an analysis of the visual and thermal properties of an ideal adaptive façade. Climate and Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) were the major variables considered. They discovered that in temperate climates (considering Rome as a reference city) a larger modulation range of the VLT and solar transmittance (i.e. Solar Heat Gain Coefficient – SHGC) would result in a significant reduction of building energy demand. Moreover ideal adaptive glazing technologies should be able to modify their spectral selectivity according to the external environmental conditions. In particular, while in the cooling season a fixed ratio of 2.41 between the VLT and SHGC is able to achieve the best results, in the mid-season a higher variability is required (1–2.41).
Llordes et al. suggested that such a feature can be ideally achieved by smart devices differentiating the transmittance modulation in visible and IR bandwidths. Some of the developed PECDs experience this property, being able to show differences in VLT and SHGC gradients. Devices fabricated by Krasovec et al. were demonstrated to have a VLT/SHGC ratio variable between about 1.5 (in the bleached state) and 2–2.3 (in the coloured one).At the same time, some of us reported similar results with VLT/SHGC variable between 1.3 and 1.7.
Durability is another major concern for adaptive and switchable façade technologies from the building industry’s perspective. An initial assessment performed on EC windows defined an ideal cyclic lifetime higher than 104–106 cycles and an overall lifetime of 5–20 years. The latter has not already been tested in PECDs, even if several studies have concentrated on the durability assessment under a lifetime viewpoint. Krasovec et al. performed tests on PEC cells at 7 days and 50 days after being assembled, finding a stable optical modulation at 50 days. However, for longer periods, some PECDs were prone to failure due to the onset of degradation on either the DSSC or the EC side of the device. In particular, an experimental test performed on a partly-covered PEC device showed a sudden drop of the light transmittance in the bleached state after 70 days of testing. Moreover the device tended to assume the maximum coloration if left at open circuit.
While the time duration of PECDs seems to be currently an issue in adopting existing technologies, the number of cycles seems to be already compatible with building integration. Several experiments have been carried out to assess the degradation of PECDs after 102–2 × 102 cycles, finding no significant reduction of optical performance. Other studies have concentrated on experiments on a larger number of cycles, typically between 103 and 5 × 103 very close to the minimum recommended values for building applications. PECDs have demonstrated to retain a good stability at the end of the experiments, only showing, in one case, an increase of bleaching time of 1 s, and in a second case a degradation of 3% of the power conversion efficiency.
Regarding coloration and bleaching time, one of the expectations of smart windows is to obtain fast switching times. This has been demonstrated to be a key feature in a field study, in which only 23% of occupants perceived a switching time of 12 minutes to be quick enough to modulate incoming solar radiation. It has to be noted that most of the devices so far developed show fast coloration and bleaching, allowing a coloration shift in less than 60 s. Only in a handful of cases a switching time higher than 10 minutes has been recorded. It is worth noting that, even if for the technology adopted in these last cases there is still room for improvement, the coloration time is independent of the area of the device. Therefore switching time should not be a pivotal issue when PECDs will be scaled up to large-area windows.

Apart from the advantages derived from the use of PECDs and PVCDs in buildings, as a dynamic tintable and energetically active portion of transparent building envelopes, this review paper underlines the influence of the constituting technologies reported in Section 1 (power supply, EC materials, electrolytes and conductive substrates) on their design principles. The evolution of devices through time (Section 2) has clearly proved that, as soon as a significant breakthrough in each of those pivotal components is available, a new step towards the improvement of PECDs can be made, influencing the evolution of device architectures as well as their potential R&D spin-offs.

In the last few years, increased interest in PECDs has been observed, worldwide, in several research groups, probably due to the renewed interest in environmental concerns and in “greening” existing technologies. Especially in the last four years, a diversification of PECD power supply systems has been proposed, in conjunction with the progressive reduction in the use of DSSCs. This trend, as reported in Section 2.1, was favored by the spread of novel, robust and solid-state PV devices, deposited on single substrates, with enhanced transparency.
For example, the employment of standard silicon-based technology for PECDs (and PVCDs, of course) in the frame of the building envelope is limited by several technical constraints. Apart from the reduction of daylight penetration through glazings, embedding opaque silicon cells, another disadvantage of this technology is known to be the loss of performance because of high temperatures and shading, caused by the surrounding buildings, their chimneys, or other kinds of obstacles, like trees. In fact, even one single partly shaded c-Si module would lead to a significant loss of power, not only in that particular module, but in all the others connected in series within the same circuit, with a resulting reduced power output. As a direct consequence, the availability of highly transparent and efficient power supply systems would dramatically affect the future evolution of PECDs: as already observed, neutral-colored and efficient perovskite-based planar heterojunction PV layers could be more compatible with BIPV issues. In comparison with conventional solar devices, perovskite modules are potentially the most environmentally sustainable PV. Recently Gong et al. performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) for two types of solution-processed perovskite solar modules, TiO2 and ZnO2 modules, to shed light on the environmental performance of this promising class of PVs. They developed comprehensive life cycle inventories (LCIs), energy and materials inventories, for all components employed in the modules.
Based on the LCI results, life cycle impact assessment was conducted for 16 midpoint common life cycle impact indicators, three endpoint indicators following the Eco-indicator 99 methodology, and two sustainable indicators: the energy payback time (EPBT) and the CO2 emission factor.
Comparing the results of Eco-indicator 99 and the EPBT among existing PV technologies (eight PV modules), perovskite solar modules showed the shortest EPBT (0.266 year for TiO2 module and 0.192 year for ZnO2 module) with a very low environmental impact for the perovskite based ZnO module. Regarding TiO2 modules, the major contributors to environmental impacts came from the use of gold, ITO glass, and organic solvents, as well as energy intensive thermal evaporation.
Although perovskite solar modules exhibited relatively large CO2 emission factors for both types of modules, these factors are less stable and comparatively sensitive to fluctuations according to the evaluation of the sustainable indicators considering the uncertainties of the major input parameters (lifetime and performance ratio). As a result, the development of perovskite PV modules having a larger performance ratio and a longer lifetime will lead to a far lower CO2 emission factor in the future. Regarding the EC component, the development of new EC materials utilizing low temperature conditions, for instance, is crucial in the path towards the exploitation of conductive plastic substrates, for portable or cheap and environmental-friendly systems. Also conjugated EC polymers could play a pivotal role among EC materials viable for PECDs, once their main limitations, reported by Ho et al. will be overcome (high costs, lower stability, limited lifetime). In fact, not all of the EC materials or electrolytes could be practically exploited for real applications. Building integration of these materials would severely push the limits of stability of sealing agents, electrolytes (leakage and solvent evaporation) and EC materials themselves.
Moreover, each process involved in the fabrication of PECDs should be compatible with large-area industrial production technologies (like roll-to roll, screen printing or PVD), since the early design steps. A relevant aspect is indeed represented by the use of cheap and abundant materials, rather than rare (and, sometimes, toxic) ones, in view of cost-effective and environmental-friendly devices. On the other hand, the effect of conductive layers and of the underlying substrates on the cost and environmental impacts of PECDs evokes the necessity for a new design philosophy, taking into account the chance to achieve single-substrate, solid-state devices. Such a possibility would please especially manufacturers of glass facades, since maintenance and integration of devices would be facilitated.
The elevated product cost as well as the lack of standardization in the technology still remain critical aspects, limiting industrial exploitation. As reported by the US Department of Energy, to ensure wide market penetration of dynamic glass, the 2025 target should be to achieve less than 65 € m−2 extra cost, allowing a payback time of 10–12 years for residential buildings and 21–22 years for commercial ones.
Meanwhile, for existing buildings, it will be necessary to develop a suitable thin film technology to retrofit existing windows, instead of replacing the entire window, as well as employing internal self-powering systems without incorporating electrical wiring (remote control via Wi-Fi).
To date, smart glasses cover a small market size with a delay in market development and penetration.
In the end, BIPVs have encountered several obstacles to their industrial exploitation. Unexpectedly, these barriers were not only due to technological and economic aspects, but also to merely aesthetic and psychological constraints, thus limiting the use of available technologies, even if effective and non-expensive. Research advancements discussed in this review, regarding all PECD components, could promote the technology maturity of PECDs aiming at large scale utilization in future buildings.

For electrochromes (studied singly or within devices) involving a color change, the CR is a parameter measuring the intensity change between the bleached and colored states, or between two colored states. It refers to a specific wavelength, generally coincident with the maximum absorbance, in the colored form.

For materials (devices) working in transmission mode, the contrast ratio is expressed by:
where
Tb is the transmittance in the bleached form, and Tc is the transmittance in the colored state. Alternatively, color changes could be expressed in the form of a transmittance (or absorbance) modulation: ΔT% (or ΔA).


This is the time required to activate the transition between two distinct color states, or between the fully colored and the fully bleached states. It expresses the time required for the achievement of the maximum color variation or even an arbitrary fraction of it, at a specific wavelength.


This is the experimental measurement of electrochrome durability. Maximizing the number of cycles of an EC system is of course the aim of fabrication processes. According to Mortimer et al., a working minimum of about 105 cycles is advisable.


The change of the optical density, ΔOD, which is proportional to the amount of created color centers, can be expressed by the equation:
where
Tb and Tc are the transmittances before and after coloration, respectively.


Coloration efficiency is defined as the change in optical density per unit of inserted charge. To calculate the EC coloration efficiency, the optical modulation, expressed by the contrast ratio, is related to the amount of injected charge per unit sample area (cm2 C−1). The calculation of the coloration efficiency is generally related to the wavelength of maximum absorbance, since it is spectrally dependent.
A high coloration efficiency gives a large optical modulation at small charge insertion/extraction. It is taken to be positive when the absorption goes up under ion intercalation (cathodic electrochromism), and negative when the absorption goes down under ion intercalation (anodic electrochromism).



PhCE is the equivalent of coloration efficiency (CE = ΔΟD/Q) used for electrochromics, but it is more suitable for the operation conditions of photoelectrochromics. In fact, in an EC device, the charge density Q is provided by the external circuit, applying a bias, and it is easily measured. In a PECD, the charge is provided by the solar cell and it is difficult to quantify, especially for devices coloring under open circuit conditions. For this reason, the consideration of the exposure energy, given by the power density and the exposure time, is advisable for devices involving PV conversion processes.
where
I is the light intensity incident normal to the device (W m−2) and t is the exposure time (min).


This represents the residual open circuit memory of EC devices, after coloration. It is considered an asset since electrical power must be drawn only to effect changes in the optical properties and maintaining the colored condition does not require the expenditure of additional energy. For applications of EC devices, small drifts of optical transmittance within hours should be ideally observed.
