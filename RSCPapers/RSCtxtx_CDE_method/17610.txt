Four new donor–π–acceptor organic dyes (YF01–04), containing naphthalene-substituted amines as an electron donor and cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor, were designed and synthesized, and their photophysical properties and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) performances were characterized. Dyes YF02 and YF04, with 2,6-disubstituted naphthalene frameworks, were superior than their analog dyes YF03 and YF01, having 1,2-disubstituted naphthalene moiety, in incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and total solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (η). The DSCs based on YF02, comprised of diphenylamine moiety as the donor, produced the highest η of 5.29% compared to 4.03% of the analog dye YF04, which has pyrrolidine as the donor. Remarkably, a high open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.799–0.807 V was achieved in the cases of YF02–03, which have diphenylamine-donors. To better understand the structure–property relationship for DSCs application, molecular modelling was performed on YF01–04 and vertical electronic excitations were calculated using long-range corrected energy functional WB97XD and CAM-B3LYP at the basis set level DGDZVP, which were in excellent agreement with the experimental results. Moreover, the equilibrium molecular geometries of dyes YF01–04 were calculated at the density function theory (DFT) level using the hybrid energy functional B3LYP and basis set DGDZVP. The torsion angles (θ) between the naphthalene moiety and diphenylamine donor in YF02 and YF03 were more twisted than that of the pyrrolidine-donor dyes YF01 and YF04, precluding efficient intermolecular π–π charge transfer, which translated into high Voc. Compared to the reference dye TA-St-CA, which is based on diphenylamine as an electron donor linked to a phenyl ring, YF02 achieved higher Voc, which indicated that naphthalene substituted with diphenylamine is more efficient in retarding charge recombinations.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are one of the most promising next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their versatile, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly nature in comparison with traditional silicon-based solar cells. At present, state-of-the-art DSCs based on ruthenium(II)–polypyridyl complexes as the active material have an overall power conversion efficiency (η) approaching 12% under standard (Global Air Mass 1.5) illumination. However, the rarity and high cost of ruthenium metal may limit their development for large-scale applications. Metal free organic dyes have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their high molar extinction coefficients, flexible structural modifications and low costs. In the past few years, many researchers have focused on developing metal-free organic sensitizers, and some of these endeavours have achieved decent efficiencies. Among them, the donor–(π-spacer)–acceptor (D–π–A) conjugated system is the basic structure for designing organic sensitizers, due to their effective photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer characteristics. Recently, tremendous research effort has been invested in improving the efficiency of solar energy conversion. In principle, high performance DSCs require organic dyes to produce high short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), high open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), and high fill factor (FF). Generally, the efficiency of the DSC is mainly determined by Jsc and Voc. Jsc is usually correlated with the absorption ability and electron injection efficiency of organic dyes, while the effect of Voc is considered to be more complicated than Jsc. Therefore, in order to further improve the efficiency of DSCs, a fundamental understanding of structure–property relationship is needed to reduce the charge recombination and increase the electron injection efficiency. In addition, charge recombination and electron injection efficiency are closely correlated with Voc, which means that Voc becomes the key factor amongst many responsible for enhancing the performance of DSCs. One strategy to improve Voc is to decrease the molecular π-stacked aggregation of dyes on the TiO2 surface, because strong dye aggregation can lead to self-quenching and reduction of electron injection resulting in a low Voc. In our recent study of DSCs based on AK01 dye compared to TA-St-CA dye (Fig. 1), it was demonstrated that AK01 showed higher overall conversion efficiency (η) than TA-St-CA (6.20% vs. 5.41%). The Voc of AK01 was much lower than TA-St-CA (0.64 V vs. 0.718 V), and the higher efficiency of AK01 was mainly ascribed to the higher Jsc. Considering the structures of triphenylamine (TA-St-CA) and indoline moiety (AK01), it is likely that the higher Voc of TA-St-CA is due to large torsion angles in the molecular structure of TA-St-CA. In an extension of our continued effort to enhance Voc, we report herein a novel series of D–π–A sensitizers YF based on naphthalene-linked pyrrolidine or diphenylamine as an electron donor, oligo-phenylenevinylene as a π-linkage, and cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor/anchor group (Fig. 2) for nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells. DSCs based on the novel dyes YF02 and YF04, comprised of a naphthalene-linked diphenylamine as a donor, showed a high Voc of ∼0.8 V. To study the influence of naphthalene-amine moiety and its substitution position on the photophysical, photoelectrochemical properties, and solar-cell performance, the pyrrolidine-naphthalene based dyes YF01 and YF03 were also synthesized. Molecular orbital calculations at the DFT level were performed, and the equilibrium molecular geometries of YF and TA-St-CA were calculated to better understand the structure–property relationship, and in particular the interrelationship between the torsion angles (θ1–6) and Voc.Fig. 2 shows the molecular structures of dyes YF01-04, where θ1–θ6 refer to the locations of torsion angles of interest.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on JEOL JMTC-270/54/SS (JASTEC, 400 MHz) spectrometers. 1H NMR spectra are reported as follows: chemical shift in ppm (δ) relative to the chemical shift of CDCl3 at 7.26 ppm, integration, multiplicities (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet and m = multiple), and coupling constants (Hz). 13C NMR spectra are reported in ppm (δ) relative to the central line of triplet for CDCl3 at 77.00 ppm. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a BRUKER APEXIII spectrometer. Column chromatography was carried out employing Silica gel 60N (spherical, neutral, 40–100 μm, KANTO Chemical Co.). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on 0.2 mm precoated plate Kieselgel 60 F254 (Merck). All other reagents and solvents commercially available were used without further purification unless otherwise noted.


A mixture of the corresponding aldehyde derivatives (1.2 mmol), 2-cyanoacetic acid (306 mg, 3.6 mmol) and ammonium acetate (46 mg, 0.6 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL acetonitrile and 10 mL acetic acid, and the mixture was stirred for 12 hours in Ar under reflux condition. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography to give compounds YF01–04.

Ground state equilibrium molecular geometries of YF01–04 were calculated using the hybrid DFT energy functional B3LYP and the basis set DGDZVP (density Gauss double-ζ with polarization functions). Subsequently, a single point energy calculation was performed on the optimized geometry using different long-range corrected time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) energy functional methods including CAM-B3LYP or WB97XD with the basis set DGDZVP, and the electronic absorption spectra were extracted. The TD-DFT calculations were performed in ethanol using the polarizable conductor calculation model (PCM). The DFT/TD-DFT calculations were performed on the East Carolina University's Super Computer Jasta using 8 processors and 4 GB of RAM. The solvent effect was accounted for using the PCM, implemented in Gaussian 09. All calculations were performed using Gaussian 09.


A double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode 15 μm in thickness, composed of a 10 μm thick nanoporous layer and a 5 μm thick scattering layer (area: 0.25 cm2), was prepared by screen printing on conducting glass substrate. A dye solution of YF04–01 with 3 × 10−4 M concentration in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1/1, v/v) was used to up take the dye on to the TiO2 film. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) (20 mM) was added into the dye solution as a co-adsorbent to prevent aggregation of the dye molecules. The TiO2 films were immersed in the dye solution and then kept at 25 °C for 30 h. Photovoltaic measurements were performed in a sandwich type solar cell in conjunction with an electrolyte consisting of a solution of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile (AN). The dye-deposited TiO2 film and a platinum-coated conducting glass were separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer frame. Photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) of sealed solar cells was measured under AM (Air Mass) 1.5 G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a metal mask of 0.25 cm2. The photovoltaic parameters, i.e. short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) were estimated from I–V characteristics under illumination.


The IMVS spectra were measured with a potentiostat (Solartron1287) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron1255B) at an open-circuit condition, based on a monochromatic illumination (420 nm) controlled by Labview system, to obtain the photovoltaic response induced by the modulated light. The modulated light was driven with a 10% AC perturbation current superimposed on a DC current in a frequency range from 0.1 to 106 Hz. The charge extraction method (CEM) was performed with the same monochromatic light source. The solar cell was illuminated at an open-circuit condition for 5 s to attain a steady state and then the light source was switched off when the device simultaneously switched to a short-circuit condition to extract the charges generated at that light intensity. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured with an impedance analyzer (Solartron Analytical, 1255B) connected with a potentiostat (Solartron Analytical, 1287) under illumination using a solar simulator (WXS-155S-10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan). EIS spectra were recorded over a frequency range of 10−2 to 106 Hz at 298 K. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set at the Voc of the DSCs. The electrical impedance spectra were characterized using Z-View software (Solartron Analytical).


The synthesis routes of compounds YF01–04 are shown in Scheme 1. The 2-amino-substituted 1-naphthaldehydes were prepared according to the reported methods (Scheme S1, ESI). The substituted (E)-4-(2-(naphthalenyl)vinyl)benzaldehydes were synthesized in high yield by using the Vilsmeier–Haack, Wittig–Horner and Buchwald–Hartwig reactions which were described in ESI. The target compounds YF01–04 were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation from the corresponding aldehydes with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate in high yields as described in the Experimental section.

The photophysical properties of dyes YF01–04 in ethanol solution and on TiO2 film are summarized in Table 1. The wavelengths of the absorption maxima (λmax) are in the range of 404–423 nm due to the similar π–π* electron transitions of YF dyes as shown in Fig. 3a. The absorption maxima of pyrrolidine based sensitizers YF01 and YF04 were observed at a slightly longer wavelength region compared to diphenylamine based sensitizers, due to the stronger donor ability of pyrrolidine than diphenylamine. The molar extinction coefficients (ε) at the maximum absorption wavelength for these dyes are in the range of 1.1–3.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1, where YF02 exhibits the highest ε value. When absorbed on transparent thin TiO2 film, YF01–04 showed broad absorption spectra, similar to those in solution, while the absorption peaks are slightly blue-shifted due to the interaction between the carboxylic group and TiO2 (Fig. 3b). Upon dye adsorption on TiO2 film, the tails of the absorption spectra of all sensitizers are red-shifted compared to those of the absorption spectra in solution. It is worth mentioning that the tail of the absorption spectrum of dye YF04 extended up to 650 nm, which is highly desirable for harvesting more of the solar spectrum and leads to a large photocurrent.

The ionization potential (IP) of YF dyes bound to nanocrystalline TiO2 film was measured using the photoemission yield spectrometer (Riken Keiki, AC-3E) (Fig. S1, ESI). The IP values which correspond to ground-state oxidation potentials (S+/0) were found to be −5.71, −5.70, −5.91 and −5.54 eV for the sensitizers YF01–04, which were sufficiently lower than the redox potential of I−/I3− (−5.20 eV), to ensure favourable thermodynamic ground states for efficient regeneration of the dye through reaction of the oxidized dye with iodide. The IP value of YF04 was shifted positively compared to the other YF dyes due to the stronger electron donation of pyrrolidine moiety at the 6-position of naphthalene, which furnished more charge transfer from D to A. Moreover, this positive shift increased the negative free energy of electron injection, which furnishes a more favorable thermodynamic excited state for electron injection, which can lead to more photocurrent (see Table 1, Jsc). The onset of the optical energy gap (E0–0) of YF dyes was in the range of 1.91–2.39 eV (Table 1). The excited-state oxidation potential (S+/*) of sensitizers YF01–04 was in the range of −3.45 to −3.63 eV, which lies above the conduction band edge (−4.2 eV) of the nanocrystalline TiO2 (Table 1), thus ensuring efficient electron injection into the conduction band edge of TiO2 from the adsorbed YF sensitizers.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for DSCs based on YF dyes are plotted in Fig. 4a. The IPCEs of YF02 and YF03 are relatively blue-shifted compared to the dyes YF04 and YF01, consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra of dye adsorbed on TiO2 film (Fig. 3b). Dyes YF02 and YF04 comprised of a donor moiety at the 6-position of naphthalene showed higher maximum IPCEs than those of dyes with the donor moiety at the 2-position of naphthalene (YF01 and YF03). The maximum quantum efficiency of YF02 and YF04 reached up to 86% in the plateau region. These results implied that the rod-like D–π–A structure should be favorable for efficient electron injection quantum yield.
The solar cell performance for the DSCs based on YF dyes is listed in Table 1, and the corresponding I–V curves are shown in Fig. 4b. Dye YF02 showed the highest η (5.29%) among the four dyes with Jsc, Vocand FF of 9.19 mA cm−2, 0.799 V and 0.721, respectively. Under the same conditions, the overall η of dyes YF01, YF03, and YF04 were 3.57%, 3.67%, and 4.03%, respectively. DSCs based on the rod-like dyes, YF02 and YF04, produced higher Jsc than YF01 and YF03, which may be attributed to the more efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor moiety of the formers. Remarkably, the Voc of the diphenyl(naphthyl)amine based dyes, YF02 and YF03, reach about 0.8 V, which is much higher than the naphthalene-substituted pyrrolidine based dyes, YF01 and YF04. This can be rationalized by the increased intermolecular π–π interaction of the pyrrolidine based dyes (YF04 and YF01) which have less twisted structures compared to the diphenylamine based dyes (YF02 and YF03), which are more twisted due to large torsion-angles. The strong intermolecular π–π interactions on the TiO2 surface may cause a self-quenching process, resulting in a low Voc, and hence poor device performance.
The generation of Voc is related to the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band (ECB) and the charge recombination rate in DSCs. To clarify the effect of molecular planarity on Voc, the charge extraction and lifetime (τe) of YF dyes based DSCs were measured. As shown in Fig. 5a, measurement of the ECB with the CEM shows that all of the dyes have almost same effect on the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, the improvement of Voc of YF-dyes based DSCs should be attributed to the suppression of charge recombination, which is related to the τe. The τe was measured by means of IMVS, as shown in Fig. 5b. The τe values for the DSCs based on YF02 and YF03 dyes are much larger than those of YF01 and YF04 dyes, which suggests that the YF02 and YF03 dyes having a low planarity favours the blocking of I3− ions approaching the TiO2 surface for charge recombination, and thus show an improvement in Voc.
EIS was employed to study the influence of electron recombination and interfacial charge transfer process on Voc.Fig. 6 shows the EIS Nyquist and Bode plots for the DSCs based on YF dyes. The values of the first few points for all YF-DSCs in the Nyquist plots corresponding to the series resistance and electrolyte resistance are almost the same. The reciprocal of the peak frequency for the left-frequency peak in the Bode plot is regarded as the electron lifetime, which represents the charge transfer process at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface. The YF02 and YF03 dyes afford higher lifetimes and charge transfer resistances at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface (Rrec) than YF01 and YF04 dyes. This trend is in accordance with the τevs. Voc results, implying that the decrease in molecular aggregation of dyes by introduction of naphthalene linked diphenylamine donor moiety may suppress the electron recombination rate between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte.
In order to gain more insights and better understanding into the electronic and molecular geometry of YF dyes, equilibrium molecular geometry, vertical electronic excitation values, delocalizations of HOMO and LUMO, and torsion angles θ1–θ6 were calculated.
The calculated HOMO and LUMO isodensities superimposed on the molecular structures of the dyes are shown in Fig. 7. The HOMOs are delocalized considerably on the electron donor synthon where the auxochrome (pyrrolidine or diphenylamine) resides, which facilitates reduction with I−, making dye regeneration more efficient. On the other hand, the LUMO was mainly delocalized on the π* cyanuric unit and has significant contributions from the carboxylic groups, which facilitates electron injection from the photoexcited sensitizer into the TiO2 semiconductor. This confirms that the D–π–A structural motif is an excellent design for efficient charge transfer and separation in DSCs.
Results from equilibrium molecular geometry demonstrated that the pyrrolidine ring at position 6 in dye YF04 is coplanar with the rest of the dye molecule, furnishing strong intermolecular π–π overlap in the D–π–A motif. In the case of dye YF01, however, the location of the pyrrolidine ring is at position 2, which is twisted out of the plane by 33.99 (θ1) and also forces the stilbene moiety out of the plane by 44.04 (θ2) (Table 2). This explains why dye YF04 is bathochromically shifted compared to dye YF01. On the other hand, in the case of dye YF02, the diphenylamine is at position 6 and is twisted by 33.33 out of the plane. While in the case of dye YF03, the diphenylamine is at position 2, therefore it is more twisted out of the plane by 62.16° (θ4) and also forces the stilbene moiety out of the plane by 46.66° (θ5). Considering the strength of pyrrolidine compared to biphenyl amine as an electron-donor auxochorme and the greater twist in the torsion angles generated by the introduction of the latter at position 2, one would expect that, in the case of dye YF03, the π–π overlap and π–π* charge transfer would be weaker than that of dye YF01, because the greater twist in the former would significantly enhance the Voc, but decrease the intermolecular charge transfer within the molecule. Therefore, it would be expected that the electron injection, and hence in theory the Jsc, of dye YF03 should be weaker than that of dye YF01, and the Voc of dye YF03 should be higher than YF01, which is consistent with the experimental results. Moreover, by the same analogy, the torsion angle θ6 (4.01) in dye YF04 is significantly less twisted compared to θ3 (33.33) in dye YF02, which produces stronger π–π overlap and π–π* charge transfer in the former, which explains why dye YF04 produced the higher Jsc and lower Voc compared to dye YF02. Due to the introduction of diphenylamine at position 2 in dye YF03, the twist in torsion angles θ4 and θ5 were the largest amongst all the dyes, which significantly reduced the π–π* charge transfer. This explains why YF03 produced the lowest Jsc and highest Voc (0.807 V) amongst all the dyes. In comparison to YF03, YF02 shows a much higher Jsc and a comparably high Voc (0.799), which are the important parameters allowing dye YF02 to produce the highest solar to electric efficiency of 5.29%.

The calculated and the experimental λmax of YF dyes are shown in Table 3. Excellent correlation between the experimental and calculated λmax values was found by using the energy functional B3LYP and the basis set DGDZVP for geometry optimization, and the TD-DFT energy calculations utilizing the long-range corrected energy functional WB97XD and basis set DGDZVP, which was found to be superior to the long-range corrected energy functional CAM-B3LYP.

Although the dyes containing triarylamine unit as donors always show high Voc compared to other organic dyes,Voc of up to 0.8 V have rarely been reported. To better understand the relationship between high Voc and molecular geometry, the equilibrium molecular geometries of dyes YF02 and TA-St-CA were further calculated using the hybrid energy functional B3LP and basis set DGDZVP. As shown in Fig. 8, YF02(a) and (b) torsion angles are 33.33 and 40.81, while TA-ST-CA(a) and (b) torsion angles are 34.33 and 35.44, respectively. The overall twist around diphenylamine in YF02 is greater than that of TA-ST-CA, supporting our experimental results that DSCs based on the new dye YF02, with a diphenyl(naphthyl)amine as a donor, showed higher Voc than the DSC based on TA-ST-CA, which has a triphenylamine as a donor.

We have synthesized a series of new organic dyes YF01–04 based on naphthylamine moiety as a donor unit in the D–π–A system for nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells. The dyes YF02 and YF04, having amine donors substituted at 6-position of naphthalene moiety, furnished better charge separation and more photocurrent than the dyes YF01 and YF03, which have amine donors at 2-position of naphthalene moiety. Moreover, the dyes YF02 and YF03, with diphenylamine as a donor, showed a very high Voc of about 0.8 V due to their highly twisted geometry, which led to the highest overall conversion efficiency of 5.29% for YF02. The EIS and electron lifetime measurements indicated that the DSCs sensitized with YF02 and YF03 dyes have a larger τe and Rrec than that of YF01 and YF04 dyes, which resulted in higher Voc. DFT calculations indicated that the torsion angles around naphthalene in the phenylamine based dyes (YF02 and YF03) are more twisted than the pyrroline based dyes (YF01 and YF04), which contributed to less dye aggregation on TiO2, resulting in a high Voc. Further molecular geometry calculation of the triphenylamine based dye TA-St-CA, and the result that a higher Voc of YF02 than that of TA-St-CA, indicated that the existence of naphthalene moiety linked to diphenylamine is favourable for retarding charge recombination. The introduction of naphthalene moiety in D–π–A dyes might be a promising way to inhibit the molecular aggregation of dyes and hence enhance solar cell performance. With the aid of molecular modelling and molecular engineering, synthesis is under way in our laboratory to develop a novel generation of more efficient naphthalene-based dyes, which have the potential to exhibit significant increases in DSC performance across a wider range of the solar spectrum.
