Generally, molecular optimization is widely used to fine-tune the absorption features and energy levels of photovoltaic materials to improve their photovoltaic performance for polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we demonstrate an example that the morphological properties can be effectively optimized by conjugated side-chain engineering on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit. The polymer donors PBNT-S with an alkylthio-thienyl substituent and PBNP-S with an alkylthio-phenyl substituent have identical absorption spectra and energy levels, while exhibiting significantly different morphological properties when blended with nonfullerene acceptor Y6. The PBNT-S:Y6 blend shows obviously excessive crystallinity with excessive domain sizes, while the PBNP-S:Y6 blend realizes better nanoscale phase separation. As a result, a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.31% with a high fill factor (FF) of 0.694 is achieved in the PBNP-S:Y6-based device, while the PBNT-S:Y6-based device yields a moderate PCE of 11.10% and a relatively low FF of 0.605. Additionally, PBNP-S shows great potential in semitransparent PSCs, and the PBNP-S:Y6-based semitransparent PSC achieves an outstanding PCE of 11.86%, with an average visible transmittance of 24.3%. The results demonstrate a feasible strategy to manipulate the morphological properties of blend films via rational molecular optimization to improve the photovoltaic performance.

As the key component of polymer solar cells (PSCs), the photoactive layer which generally consists of a p-type conjugated polymer as the donor and an n-type organic semiconductor as the acceptor plays a critical role in determining the performance of devices. In the past decades, the innovation of photovoltaic materials (including donor and acceptor materials) has been the major driving force dominating the development of PSCs. In a PSC, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is proportional to the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). To achieve high PCE in terms of molecular design, suitable energy levels and strong light-harvesting capability are required for polymer donors to ensure high Voc and high Jsc. In the past decades, tremendous molecular design strategies which have been rationally conducted on polymer donors have been developed to address these issues, such as building conjugated main-chains with various electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties, engineering side-chains, and using smart substituents. Beyond the energy levels and absorption features, it is desirable to tune the crystallinity of the polymer donor to match with the acceptor for realizing nanoscale phase separation in the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend for efficient charge separation and transport to obtain high Jsc and FF values. Unlike the energy levels and absorption features which can be manipulated straightforward, it is more complicated to tune the morphological properties of blend films via the molecular design strategy.

Engineering conjugated side-chains in the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit is a feasible strategy to manipulate the photovoltaic performance of donor materials. For instance, due to the easier twisting and more conformations of thiophene than the phenyl unit, changing the substituted conjugated side-chains from thiophene to phenyl units on BDT can effectively improve the morphological properties to obtain better photovoltaic performance of small-molecule donor materials. In this contribution, we demonstrated an example that the morphology of the blend film can be effectively optimized by conducting conjugated side-chain engineering on the polymer donor, thus realizing improved photovoltaic performance. Two polymers (namely PBNT-S and PBNP-S, as shown in Fig. 1a) were designed by introducing alkylthio-thienyl and alkylthio-phenyl substituents onto the BDT unit to copolymerize with the dialkylthio-substituted naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione (NTDO) unit. In comparison with the thiophene unit, the phenyl unit has a larger π-conjugated area and better planarity. This discrepancy on the polymers slightly affected the absorption spectra and energy levels, while leading to much different aggregation properties when blended with nonfullerene acceptor Y6. The PBNT-S:Y6 blend showed obviously excessive crystallinity with excessive domain sizes, whereas the PBNP-S:Y6 blend formed appropriate phase separation with a well-developed fibrillar structure. As a result, a notable PCE of 14.31% along with a high FF of 0.694 was obtained in the PBNP-S:Y6-based device, while the device based on PBNT-S:Y6 yielded a moderate PCE of 11.10% with a significantly lower FF of 0.605. In addition, PBNP-S exhibits promising potential in high-performance semitransparent PSCs, and the PBNP-S-based semitransparent PSC showed an outstanding PCE of 11.86% and an average visible transmittance (AVT, calculated from 370 to 740 nm) of 24.3%. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to optimize the BHJ morphology to improve the photovoltaic properties via conjugated side-chain engineering in polymer donors, and PBNP-S is a promising polymer donor for high-performance opaque/semitransparent PSCs.

The chemical structures of PBNT-S, PBNP-S, and Y6 are shown in Fig. 1a. The synthetic routes and detailed synthetic procedures of the two polymers are provided in the ESI. PBNT-S and PBNP-S have good solubility in common solvents, such as chlorobenzene, chloroform, and toluene. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined to be 17.6 kDa and 2.56 for PBNT-S and 16.7 kDa and 2.53 for PBNP-S by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C, respectively.

The two polymers in dilute chloroform exhibited nearly identical absorption spectra covering the wavelength range of 300–700 nm, as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI. In comparison with PBNT-S, PBNP-S exhibited a clearer and stronger shoulder peak, indicating its stronger polymer aggregation in dilute solution. The absorption edge of PBNT-S in the thin film is red-shifted from 687 nm in solution to 703 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.76 eV. The neat PBNP-S film has a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum with an absorption edge of 692 nm (Eg = 1.79 eV) compared to PBNT-S, which should be ascribed to the stronger electron-rich capability of the thiophene substituted BDT unit than that of the phenyl substituted BDT unit.
The electronic energy levels of PBNT-S and PBNP-S were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry measurements, as shown in Fig. S2. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels were determined to be −5.44 and −3.44 eV for PBNT-S and −5.44 and −3.46 eV for PBNP-S, respectively, indicating that the conjugated side-chains on the BDT unit barely influence the energy levels. The low-lying HOMO levels of the polymers are matched with Y6 as the acceptor. We then performed the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the effect of conjugated side chain substitution on the molecular orbital surface pattern and optimized geometry. As depicted in Fig. 2, the two polymers exhibited similar electron density distributions both in the LUMO and HOMO levels, respectively. Relative to PBNT-S, the phenyl substitution on the BDT unit of PBNP-S led to a slightly more twisted conjugated backbone. It can be concluded that the conjugated side chains on the BDT unit slightly affect the absorption features and molecular planarity and barely influence the energy levels.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PBNT-S and PBNP-S as donor materials, PSC devices with the conventional architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:Y6/PDINO/Al were fabricated, where Y6 and PDINO were used as the acceptor material and electron transport layer, respectively. For the devices based on PBNT-S and PBNP-S, the optimal donor (D):acceptor (A) weight ratio is 1:1.5 and the post-treatments are using 1% 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) as the solvent additive and thermal annealing (TA) at 60 °C for 10 minutes (as shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI, the optimal active layer thickness is ∼95 nm). The key parameters of the optimal devices are listed in Table 1 and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3a.

The optimal device based on PBNT-S:Y6 exhibited a moderate PCE of 11.10%, with a Voc of 0.798 V, a Jsc of 23.00 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.605. Although PBNT-S and PBNP-S exhibited similar HOMO levels, a slightly higher Voc of 0.810 V was achieved in the PBNP-S-based device. It should be mentioned that although Voc is tightly correlated with the energy level gap between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, Voc is also decided by a couple of other factors, such as the morphology of the blend film and the coupling between donor and acceptor materials. Impressively, a much higher Jsc of 25.5 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.694 were obtained in the device based on PBNP-S:Y6, enabling a higher PCE of 14.31% as compared to that of the PBNT-S-based device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out to confirm the accuracy of the Jsc values of the two devices obtained from J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. 3b, the two devices exhibited a broad photon-to-current response in the wavelength range of 400 to 850 nm, and significantly higher EQE values were observed in the PBNP-S-based device compared to those of the device based on PBNT-S, corresponding to the higher Jsc value. The integrated Jsc values obtained from the EQE curves were 21.48 mA cm−2 for the PBNT-S-based device and 24.50 mA cm−2 for the PBNP-S-based device, which are consistent with the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurements if considering a little degradation of the device during the EQE measurement in air.
In view of the fact that the PBNP-S:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) blend film exhibited high transmittance in the visible wavelength region (as shown in Fig. S3), we further exploited the application of PBNP-S in semitransparent PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBNP-S:Y6/PDINO/Au (1 nm)/Ag. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4a, the semitransparent device with 10 nm Ag as the electrode exhibited a PCE of 10.83%, with a high AVT of 28.2% (Fig. 4b). Upon increasing the Ag electrode thickness to 15 nm, a higher PCE of 11.21% along with an AVT of 26.3% was realized. The semitransparent device with 20 nm Ag as the electrode demonstrated a remarkable PCE of 11.86% and an AVT of 24.3% (Fig. 4b). It should be mentioned that the PCE of 11.86% is one of the top efficiencies reported for the semitransparent PSCs with AVT over 20%. The EQE spectra of the three semitransparent PSCs with different Ag layer thicknesses are shown in Fig. 4c. The calculated Jsc values obtained from the EQE spectra of the corresponding semitransparent devices are listed in Table 2, which are consistent with the values obtained from the J–V measurements. The semitransparent PSCs showed relatively low EQE values in the short wavelength range (300–600 nm) and high values in the long wavelength region (600–850 nm), resulting from the absorption features of the blend films and the transmittance spectra of the electrodes. Quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) was calculated to further verify the PCE and AVT of the three semitransparent PSCs. As shown in Fig. S4, the QUE values of the semitransparent PSCs were determined to be lower than 84% in the entire photon response range due to the inevitable photon and carrier loss.

We then used the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram to evaluate the color rendering properties of the PBNP-S-based semitransparent device, as shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI. The color coordinate of the semitransparent PSCs with 20 nm Ag thickness is (0.2468, 0.2648), corresponding to a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 21049 K and a high color rendering index (CRI) of 95 (Table S3 in the ESI), indicating the accurate color rendering upon illumination through the semitransparent device. Fig. 4d displays the photograph of the PBNP-S-based semitransparent device with a 20 nm Ag cathode, where the background pattern can be clearly seen through the device.

It is noted that the better photovoltaic performance of the PBNP-S-based device than that of the device based on PBNT-S originated from the higher FF and Jsc values, which are closely related to the charge transport and recombination properties of the blend films. Generally, high and balanced charge-carrier mobility in the blend film is critical to achieve high FF for PSCs. Thus, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to evaluate the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the PBNT-S:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) and PBNP-S:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) blend films. The pristine PBNP-S film exhibited a higher μh of 6.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than PBNT-S with μh = 5.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S6). As shown in Fig. 5a and S6 in the ESI, the PBNT-S:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) blend film exhibited a μh of 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 6.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a μh/μe ratio of 0.32. In comparison with the PBNT-S:Y6 blend, both higher μh of 8.25 × 10−4 and μe of 6.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed in the PBNP-S:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) blend film, with a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.23, corresponding to the higher FF value for the PBNP-S:Y6 based PSC.

Then the charge dissociation and collection in the two blends were studied by plotting the curves of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) of the device can be determined by normalizing Jph with respect to saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat). As shown in Fig. 5b, a higher Pdiss (Jph under the short circuit condition) of 94.5% was fitted for the PBNP-S-based device compared to the device based on PBNT-S with a Pdiss of 93.6%. The charge collection efficiency (Pcoll, Jph under the maximum power output condition) of the PBNT-S and PBNP-S-based devices was fitted to 90.8% and 90.6%, respectively, indicating the similar charge collection efficiency of the two optimal devices. The more efficient charge dissociation of the PBNP-S:Y6-based device should be favorable for obtaining higher FF compared to the device based on PBNT-S:Y6. In addition to the efficient charge dissociation and extraction, recombination dynamics also play an important role in determining the FF value in a PSC. Thus, the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (Plight) was plotted to get deep insight into the charge recombination kinetics in the two devices. The degree of bimolecular recombination in a PSC can be evaluated by the relationship between the Jsc and Plight (Jsc ∝ Plightα), and the exponential factor α should be equal to 1 if the bimolecular recombination is negligible. In comparison with the PBNT-S-based device with an α value of 0.920, a higher α value of 0.937 was fitted for the device based on PBNP-S (as shown in Fig. 5c), indicating a weaker extent of bimolecular recombination in the PBNP-S:Y6 blend. In addition, the slope of Voc values versus logarithmic dependence of Plight (Voc ∝ lnPlight) was fitted to determine the trap-assisted recombination in the two devices. A slope of 1 × kT/q (k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge) suggests free carrier bimolecular recombination in the device, while a slope of 2 × kT/q implies the monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination. As depicted in Fig. 5d, a smaller slope of 1.007 kT/q was obtained in the PBNP-S-based device compared to the slope of 1.191 kT/q for the device based on PBNT-S, implying its lower trap density and weak trap-assisted recombination. Relative to the device based on PBNT-S, the more efficient charge dissociation and collection, together with the weaker bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination in the PBNP-S-based device contribute to the improved FF and Jsc values.

Due to the limitation of the exciton diffusion length, nanoscale phase separation with a bicontinuous D/A interpenetrating network is desirable in the BHJ blend film for efficient charge separation and transportation to obtain high photovoltaic performance. We performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements to investigate the morphology of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the PBNT-S:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) blend film exhibited a rough surface with a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) value of 2.08 nm, while a more uniform and smooth surface was observed in the PBNP-S:Y6 (1:1.5, w/w) blend film, with a Rq of 1.44 nm. The TEM measurement results further revealed that the PBNT-S:Y6 blend exhibited excessive aggregation and large-scale phase separation, whereas small-size aggregation with uniform and small-scale phase separation was developed in the PBNP-S:Y6 blend (Fig. 6c and d), which could be favorable for efficient exciton dissociation and reducing bimolecular recombination as discussed above. Apparently, the replacement of the alkylthio-thienyl substituent with the alkylthio-phenyl substituent on the BDT unit of the polymer is beneficial to realize better morphology when blended with Y6. The better charge transport and weaker bimolecular recombination, together with the better morphological properties of the PBNP-S:Y6 blend compared to the PBNT-S:Y6 blend are favorable for achieving better photovoltaic performance.


In summary, we introduced alkylthio-thienyl and alkylthio-phenyl substituents onto the BDT unit to develop two copolymers PBNT-S and PBNP-S as donor materials for PSCs. Although PBNT-S and PBNP-S have identical absorption spectra and energy levels, much different morphology was observed when blended with Y6. The PBNT-S:Y6 film showed obviously excessive crystallinity with excessive domain sizes, while the PBNP-S:Y6 blend realized better nanoscale phase separation. In addition, the PBNP-S:Y6-based device showed more efficient charge dissociation and collection, weaker bimolecular recombination, and weaker trap-assisted recombination compared to the device based on PBNT-S:Y6. As a result, a notable PCE of 14.31% with a high FF of 0.694 was achieved in the PBNP-S:Y6-based device, which is significantly higher than that of the PBNT-S:Y6-based device which shows a moderate PCE of 11.10% and a relatively low FF of 0.605. What is more, the semitransparent PSC based on PBNP-S:Y6 demonstrated an outstanding PCE of 11.86%, with an AVT of 24.3%. The results indicate that PBNP-S is a promising polymer donor for high-performance opaque/semitransparent PSCs. Our results also demonstrate a feasible strategy to optimize the BHJ morphology to improve the photovoltaic properties via conjugated side-chain engineering in polymers.
