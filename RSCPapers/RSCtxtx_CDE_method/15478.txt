Cesium lead halide CsPbI3 is regarded as a promising material to solve the issues of material decomposition and ion migration caused by the organic group in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under operating conditions. However, there are many defects in a pure CsPbI3 material and its cubic phase (α-phase) is thermodynamically unstable, which will prevent a high device performance. Here, we incorporated the pseudohalide ion SCN− in a CsPbI3 thin film to improve the crystallinity with smooth perovskite films. The results of XRD and PL showed that the crystallization property of the CsPbI3 thin films with the addition of Pb(SCN)2 exhibited a huge improvement compared to the reference. The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbI3 PSCs with the optimized Pb(SCN)2 additive (2%) could reach as high as 17.04%. In addition, the CsPbI3 films with the Pb(SCN)2 additive exhibited higher thermal stability than the reference one.

The three-dimensional (3D) crystal structure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on [(MA)+/(FA)]+ and [PbI3−] can help attain incredibly high efficiency with high-quality crystal films. However, it is facing major challenges because the organic groups are sensitive to humidity and temperature, resulting in material decomposition and ion migration and confining its further development for commercialization. The replacement of organic components with inorganic cations is considered as an effective strategy to overcome the instability problems of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite. Hence, inorganic lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3 (X = halide)) have attracted much attention from researchers, resulting in significant developments. In addition, it is worth noting that the inorganic perovskite exhibits not only comparable carrier mobility with the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, but also better thermal stability.

However, compared to the organic groups, Cs+ is too small to maintain the cubic perovskite phase (α-phase) for CsPbI3, which is prone to transforming the α-phase to the undesirable yellow non-perovskite phase (δ-phase) at room temperature, resulting in the degradation of the device performance. Meanwhile, in the CsPbI3 films, there are many crystal defects including voids, which result in charge carrier recombination. This hinders the collection of photo-generated charge carriers and has a negative effect on the device performance. Hence, fabricating a CsPbI3 film with high crystalline quality is significant for its development. Among all the ways to realize this goal, compositional engineering is the most effective method to achieve top performance of devices.
In recent years, researchers have found that the chemical behaviors and properties of pseudohalides are similar to those of true halides. Jiang's group proved that the stability of perovskite materials can be improved by displacing partial halide ions with pseudohalides. In prior publications, the pseudohalide SCN− group can occupy the X site in an ABX3 (A = organic cation, B = divalent metal, X = halide) perovskite structure. The ionic radius of the pseudohalide ion (SCN−) is 217 pm, which is close to that of I− (220 pm), and SCN− is often used as an additive to passivate defects and improve the crystal size in hybrid PSCs. Therefore, the stability and various photoelectric properties of the perovskite materials can be designed without affecting the crystal structure by means of partially substituting I− ions with SCN−. By adjusting the I−/SCN− ratio, (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 with obviously different electronic properties can be achieved in a hybrid perovskite. In fact, the incorporation of the SCN− group can also improve the photocurrent density owing to the promotion of the optical absorption and charge transport. Therefore, thiocyanate has similar properties to the halogen ion and exhibits better chemical stability.
In this paper, we introduced the SCN− group into CsPbI3 by adding lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) to the CsPbI3 precursor solution and achieved larger-sized crystals and fewer trapped CsPbI3 films. Crystal defects were significantly decreased and the device properties showed clear improvements after adding Pb(SCN)2. The photovoltaic performance of the CsPbI3 PSCs was measured. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized CsPbI3 PSCs with the Pb(SCN)2 additive (2%) could reach as high as 17.04% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.09 V, a high FF of 77, and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.34 mA cm−2. We also discovered that the crystalline quality of the CsPbI3 films showed huge improvements compared to the reference one. The results indicate that the pseudohalide SCN−-doped CsPbI3 is a promising material for fabricating high-performance PSCs.

As shown in Fig. 1a, all of the phase structures of the synthesized CsPbI3 thin films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates with different concentrations of the Pb(SCN)2 additive were investigated by XRD patterns. The CsPbI3 thin films were fabricated with different concentrations of the Pb(SCN)2 additive: 0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%. From these results, we can see that the peak positions of those CsPbI3 films were consistent with the reference CsPbI3 (0% Pb(SCN)2 additive) thin film. There were no impurity peaks in them, indicating that all the samples were of the standard crystal structure and the phase structure was not affected by the addition of Pb(SCN)2 in the crystal growth process.

It is obvious that the characteristic peak position shifted to a higher angle (as shown in Fig. 1b) because of a decrease in the lattice volume after the addition of Pb(SCN)2. The peak position of the CsPbI3 films with the Pb(SCN)2 additive moved to a higher angle because the ionic radius of SCN− is 217 pm, which is smaller than that of I− (220 pm), indicating that SCN− was successfully introduced into the perovskite lattice. The diffraction peaks of the Pb(SCN)2 phase was not found, indicating that there was no excess Pb(SCN)2 on the surface of the CsPbI3 films. Moreover, all the XRD peak intensities of the CsPbI3 films with the addition of various concentrations of Pb(SCN)2 are considerably stronger than that of the pure CsPbI3 thin film, implying that Pb(SCN)2 promotes the crystallization process and decreases impediments.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsPbI3 films with different concentrations of the Pb(SCN)2 additive are presented in Fig. 1c. The results show that the CsPbI3 films with the additive exhibited similar absorption spectra to that of the reference film and no obvious shifts were observed. All of the CsPbI3 film samples showed a consistent optical absorption band edge at 726 nm, indicating that SCN− as the substitution group had no significant effect on the absorption. Hence, the SCN−-doped CsPbI3 perovskite still had a direct bandgap, and the bandgap width showed no obvious change. It is worth noting that the absorption intensity of the CsPbI3 films with the addition concentrations of 2% and 4% was slightly increased in the 450–700 nm region compared to that of the reference film. However, the UV-vis spectrum of the CsPbI3 film with 1% SCN− was similar to that of the reference film. This is consistent with the subsequent study of the crystallization rate. After the Pb(SCN)2 addition, the CsPbI3 film became darker and promoted the optical absorption.
To investigate the surface morphologies of all the CsPbI3 films with the addition of different concentrations of Pb(SCN)2, top-view SEM measurements were performed and are presented in Fig. 2a–d. Fig. 2a shows that some voids and high-density grain boundaries existed in the reference CsPbI3 film synthesized by the one-step process, which is unquestionably detrimental to the performance of the device. Compared to the reference film, the CsPbI3 films with the addition of 1% and 2% concentration Pb(SCN)2 (Fig. 2b and c) were compact with no pinholes. However, in Fig. 2d, the voids and pinholes appeared again upon increasing the concentration to 4%. In addition, the results show that the grain size of the CsPbI3 film continued to increase after the addition of Pb(SCN)2, as seen from the SEM images, indicating that the pseudohalide ion SCN− can passivate defects and improve the crystal size. A CsPbI3 film possessing less drawbacks with a large grain size and low-density grain boundaries is necessary to reduce the non-radiative decay in the CsPbI3 layer by Pb(SCN)2 addition for high efficiency PSCs.
As shown in Fig. 2e–h, the surface morphology as a function of SCN− content was also examined with an atomic force microscope (AFM). The roughness values were 13.5 nm and 14.3 nm for the CsPbI3 thin films with the addition of 1% and 2% Pb(SCN)2 additive, respectively, which are lower than that of the reference film at 16.8 nm. However, after increasing the Pb(SCN)2 content to 4%, the roughness value increased to 17.2 nm. It is worth noting that the grain size of the CsPbI3 film with Pb(SCN)2 additives (1–2 μm) was larger than that of the reference (<1 μm). This result is consistent with the SEM data. The reduced roughness value is conducive to the interfacial spreading between PTAA and the CsPbI3 film layers, and improving the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
To investigate the surface elemental distributions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (as an accurate measurement) is necessary to confirm the existence of the SCN− ions. The results of the reference film and the 2% Pb(SCN)2 additive CsPbI3 film are shown in Fig. 3a; there is no signal from sulfur and nitrogen, suggesting that barely any SCN− ions remain in the final film. Fig. 3b and c show that the peak positions for Pb 4f and I 3d5 shift to higher binding energies after the addition of Pb(SCN)2. This indicates that strong interactions occur between Pb2+ and I−, which may lead to higher crystallinity and lower defects compared to the reference CsPbI3 film.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CsPbI3 films were measured under the same condition at 25 °C with various concentrations of Pb(SCN)2 (shown in Fig. 4a). The PL emission peaks of the CsPbI3 films with 1%, 2%, and 4% Pb(SCN)2 additive are located at 718 nm, 715 nm and 712 nm, respectively, and are all a little blue-shifted with respect to the reference film at around 726 nm. The differences in the PL intensity are caused by the consistent change in the radiative and non-radiative recombination dynamics. These results imply fewer traps and defects in the film that was treated with Pb(SCN)2. In addition, as the concentration increased, the blue shift became more obvious; however, the PL intensity rose first and then fell. All CsPbI3 films with the addition of Pb(SCN)2 showed a much stronger PL intensity compared to the reference film. In Fig. 4b and Table 1, the time-resolved PL spectrum shows that the carrier lifetimes of the CsPbI3 films with the introduced Pb(SCN)2 were longer than that of the reference film, indicating the reduction of the trap states and charge recombination. Here, the CsPbI3 films were directly fabricated on top of the glass surface to process the PL decay curves test. A 510 nm light was used as the photon excitation light. The PL decay curves were fitted using a biexponential decay function [times (τi) and amplitudes (Ai)], and the average recombination lifetimes of the samples were estimated using the equation below:
The values are 1.323, 4.021, 5.512 and 4.90 ns for the CsPbI
3 films with added concentrations of 0%, 1%, 2%, 4%, respectively.

To study how the crystallization rate of the CsPbI3 films was affected by the Pb(SCN)2 additive, we selected the optimized conditions with the 2% Pb(SCN)2 additive and the reference condition for comparison. We performed spin coating and annealing under the same conditions, and the morphology of the films at different annealing times was studied by selecting 0 min, 0.5 min, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min and ‘finished’ as the time periods. Fig. 5a shows that the crystallization rate of the film with the additive was significantly faster than that of the reference film. In addition, the color of the film was darker than that of the reference film after the final ‘finished’ annealing time, which is in accordance with the XRD and PL test results showing a higher light absorption intensity after the addition of Pb(SCN)2.
The thermal stability of a film is a critical parameter for its use in solar cells. As shown in Fig. 5a, the CsPbI3 films that had just been spin-coated were black and smooth. Subsequently, we placed them on the hot stage inside the glovebox, where the temperature was set to 80 °C. On the first day, we did not see any obvious changes on the surface. As time progressed, the decomposition rate of the CsPbI3 films with the Pb(SCN)2 additive was slower than that of the reference film, indicating that the former film had better crystallinity and fewer defects. These results demonstrate that the pseudohalide ion SCN− is conducive to improving the device performance and phase stability of CsPbI3, which is in accordance with the working mechanism of the pseudohalide ion SCN− in hybrid PSCs. From the cross-sectional SEM (Fig. 5b and c), we can see that the crystal grain is significantly increased and the entire device is compact relative to the reference sample, which is more conducive to carrier transportation and improving the properties of the device.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on the films with the Pb(SCN)2 additives, the typically planar PSC structure (FTO/TiO2/CsPbI3/PTAA/Au) was fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSC are shown in Fig. 5d, and a set of PV parameters is presented in Table 2. The PCE first increased and then decreased as the Pb(SCN)2 content increased, with the maximum PCE value occurring at 2% Pb(SCN)2. Obviously, the PSC property was significantly improved, and the champion PCE of the PSCs with the optimized Pb(SCN)2 additive (2%) reached as high as 17.04% (15.36% for the reference) with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.09 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.34 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 77%. The average PCE of the PSCs with the optimized Pb(SCN)2 additive (2%) was 16.85%, while the reference PSC showed rather low performance and the PCE was 15.12%. These results are compared with the recently reported CsPbI3-based PSCs in Table 3.

In conclusion, we successfully attained larger-sized crystals and fewer trapped CsPbI3 films with the addition of Pb(SCN)2. The champion PCE of the CsPbI3 PSCs can reach as high as 17.03%. The SEM shows that CsPbI3 films with less drawbacks and a large grain size were fabricated with the introduction of Pb(SCN)2. In addition, the Pb(SCN)2 additive had a positive effect on improving the phase stability and performance of the CsPbI3 PSCs, which may become promising candidates for new applications.


The DMAPbI3 was prepared by dissolving PbI2 in DMF/HI (v/v 1:1) solution at 70 °C for 1 h. The yellow DMAPbI3 powder was collected and washed with anhydrous diethyl ether, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C overnight. The CsPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI (0.18 g), DMAPbI3 (0.44 g), PbBr2 (5%) and different ratios of Pb(SCN)2 (from 0% to 5%) dissolved in 1 mL DMF/DMSO (v/v 9:1).

HTL solution was prepared by dissolving PTAA (90 mg), a sulfonyl imide (Li-TFSI, 22 μL) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) and tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 36 μL) in 1 mL of CB solution.

The FTO/glass substrates were cleaned in ethyl alcohol, isopropanol, acetone, and ethyl alcohol for 30 min. The TiO2 layers (40 nm) were deposited by immersing the FTO/glass substrates in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 1 h at 70 °C. Subsequently, the TiO2/FTO/glass was annealed at 200 °C for 30 min on a hotpot. The process of preparing the compact n-type blocking layer was complete.


About 60 μL of the CsPbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated on top of TiO2. The speed was increased to 4000 rpm for 40 s. Then, the substrates were heated at 180 °C for 10–20 min to obtain the dark perovskite films.


The PTAA solution was spin-coated onto the dark CsPbI3 film at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an ∼80 nm gold top electrode was thermally evaporated onto the PTAA layer.


The active area of the devices was defined as a 9 mm2 area with a metal mask clipped onto the glass side. In addition, scattered light or light piping was prevented from contributing to the photocurrent. The J–V characteristics of the PSCs were collected under an illumination of an AM 1.5 solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, Enlitech) using a digital source meter (Keithley Model 2400). The EQE spectra were collected by an EQE measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). The spectral response and the light intensity were calibrated by the certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech).
