A series of new D–π–A organic photosensitizers 7a–7d featuring a novel starburst electron donor unit and uncommon selenophene containing π-linker were synthesized, characterized, and applied for fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Dyes 11d–13d with thiophene or phenyl ring as the π-linker also were synthesized for comparison. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.67% was attained for 11d with a relatively high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.825 V using conventional I−/I3− redox electrolyte in DSSCs, and this value reaches about 84% of the device based on standard dye N719 (7.91%) under the same device fabrication conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) were applied to verify the findings. All the results suggest that starburst electron donor design strategy can be used to minimize dye aggregation on TiO2 and to slow down the charge recombination kinetics in DSSCs to improve the photovoltaic performance. Effects of using selenophene as the π-linker building block on the photovoltaic parameters also were explored and evaluated.

In the last decade, there has been great interest in the potential of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with their high performance of energy conversion, simple device manufacture, and low production cost, to compete with conventional inorganic photovoltaic modules. Among all of the DSSC photosensitizers being developed to date, the ruthenium complexes and zinc porphyrins are the most outstanding candidates for commercialization because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11% and long-term stability. As alternatives to metal-containing dyes, a number of organic photosensitizers also have been reported recently, such as coumarin dyes, indoline dyes, and triarylamine dyes. Compared with the metal-containing complexes, organic dyes have advantages of higher structural design flexibility, lower production cost, and easier preparation and purification.

It is well known that the photosensitizer has a pivotal role in the performance of DSSCs. To boost the performance of organic dyes, the chemical structures have to be modified to combat against the narrow absorption band and dye aggregation on TiO2. To achieve this goal effectively, the structure–property relationship must be elucidated so that structural modification can be accomplished in the correct direction. In general, most organic dyes are featured in a rod shaped donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) framework, but this configuration favors formation of aggregate on the surface of nanostructured TiO2 and intermolecular quenching of molecules is induced. It is reported that simple phenothiazine-based dyes with a non-planar butterfly conformation are able to inhibit the dye aggregation and the formation of intermolecular excimers, hence phenothiazine-based dyes lead to some high performance DSSC devices (PCE > 6%). Also, the electron-donating property attributed by the electron-rich sulfur and nitrogen atoms in the phenothiazine ring facilitates the electron delocalization from donor to acceptor. However, these simple phenothiazine-based dyes have relatively short π-conjugation length and this limits the absorption coverage of photovoltaic cells in the long wavelength region.
On the other hand, novel dianchoring A–π–D–π–A frameworks have been fully utilized in DSSCs. The dianchoring dyes were able to increase the electron injection efficiency and inhibit charge recombination simultaneously, so overall performances were improved compared with the single anchoring congeners. Regarding this point, a simple molecular design with a D–π–A framework, which can inhibit charge recombination and broaden light absorption coverage effectively at the same time, is still required for further development.
The bulky starburst electron donor is a potential solution to resolve such difficulty in molecular design. Several groups have reported that starburst donor-based organic dyes can increase open-circuit voltage (Voc) by inhibiting charge recombination on the dye layer interface, and increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc) by expanding and strengthening the light absorption within the solar spectrum. In this study, seven organic dyes were synthesized with different donor and π-linker combinations, in particular with the new starburst triarylamine donor (Fig. 1 and 2). For the electron donor units, disubstituted triphenylamine donor with two 9-hexylcarbazole units at the 3-position was used for comparison with some other reported donor building blocks. For the π-linker, selenophene was selected to further extend the π-conjugation because of its high electron donating effect and its uniqueness in DSSC studies. Dyes with thiophene or phenyl ring as π-linker also were synthesized for comparison. Cyanoacrylic acid acts as the electron acceptor to constitute the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption band and to facilitate electron injection into the conduction band of titanium dioxide. This electron-deficient moiety also corresponds with the anchoring unit on the surface of TiO2. The synthetic procedures were straightforward, and all the products were purified easily by column chromatography. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these organic photosensitizers were studied and the corresponding performances of DSSCs with traditional liquid electrolyte-based device structure also were investigated.

The structures of new organic photosensitizers are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Their corresponding synthetic routes are depicted in Schemes 1 and 2 and Scheme S1 (ESI). The key intermediate 2,5-dibromoselenophene (2) was prepared by bromination of selenophene (1) with N-bromosuccinimide according to a previously published method. Subsequently, compound 2 was reacted with 3-hexylthiophene-2-boronic acid under palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction conditions to yield compound 3. Then, aldehyde precursor 4 was obtained by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Bromination of 4 with N-bromosuccinimide under acidic conditions yielded brominated 5. The organic dye precursors 6a–6d were prepared by a Suzuki coupling reaction of 5 with the corresponding arylboronic acids. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation using cyanoacetic acid was performed to prepare organic photosensitizers 7a–7d with high yields of around 90%. For 11d–13d, the key intermediates 11b–13b were obtained by either bromination using N-bromosuccinimide or iodination using potassium iodide and potassium iodate of 11a–13a under acidic conditions. Eventually, organic photosensitizers 11d–13d were prepared by a Suzuki coupling reaction of 11b–13b with (9-hexylcarbazolyl)boronic acid and subsequent Knoevenagel condensation in high yield. All the organic precursors were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The singlet peak positioned at around δ 10.0 ppm refers to the proton of aldehyde on the corresponding organic aldehyde precursors. All the target organic dyes were soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dimethyl sulfoxide, and were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. In their 1H NMR spectra, the downfield singlet peaks positioned at around δ 8.5 ppm are the specific peaks of the proton on the carbon–carbon double bond of cyanoacrylic acid. Complete conversion of aldehyde precursors to the target organic dyes could be indicated by the disappearance of the singlet peak positioned at around δ 10.0 ppm and the presence of a new singlet peak positioned at δ 8.5 ppm.


The UV/Vis absorption spectra of all the organic photosensitizers in CH2Cl2 solution are depicted in Fig. 3, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. All these organic dyes possess two main structureless broad absorption bands in the range of 300–600 nm. The molar extinction coefficients (10000–70000 mol−1 cm−1) of these photosensitizers are comparable with other D–π–A starburst donor-based dyes reported in the literature, and dyes 7a–7d, 11d and 12d possess much higher molar extinction coefficients than those of standard ruthenium dyes. The absorption bands at short wavelength (centered at 340–362 nm) are assigned to the localized aromatic π–π* transitions and the low-energy broad absorption bands (centered at 458–511 nm) refer to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from electron donor to electron acceptor. It is evidenced that the replacement of terminal donor (7a–7d) or π-linker (7d, 11d–13d) in such a framework modulates the absorption profiles of organic dyes, including the localized π–π* transitions band and especially the ICT bands. The peak absorption wavelengths of ICT bands are red-shifted in the order of 13d (458 nm) < 12d (478 nm) < 11d (480 nm) < 7d (511 nm). This is most probably correlated with the diminishing electron donating strength of π-linkers in the order of 2,5-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)selenophene > 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene > 3-hexylthiophene > phenyl ring. Importantly, the adoption of starburst donor units in 7b–7d (with smaller optical band gap values) allows us to broaden the absorption coverage and to enhance the absorption intensity compared with the non-starburst donor organic dye 7a bearing alkylated carbazole.

To identify high performance photosensitizers for DSSCs, the optimal energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) must be attained. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to calculate the values and hence to examine the energy offsets of the dye molecules between the semiconducting TiO2 film and the redox electrolytes (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI). If the conduction band edge of TiO2 was significantly more negative than the energy level of LUMO of the photosensitizers, this would favor the electron injection process because of the larger driving force for charge separation. If the redox potential of redox shuttle (iodide/triiodide ions) in the electrolyte was considerably more positive than the HOMO energy level of the dye, efficient dye regeneration would occur. Both of these processes are necessary to afford charge separation at the interface for energy conversion. CV was performed with the corresponding photosensitizer films on the glassy carbon electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The results of these organic dyes are shown in Table 2.

The first observed oxidation is ascribed to removal of an electron from the electron-rich units in the molecule, and the reduction wave observed is an indication of electron gain to the electron-deficient moiety. The LUMO energy levels of all the organic dyes (ranging from −3.39 to −3.48 eV) are more positive than that of the energy level of the conduction band edge of titanium dioxide (−4.4 eV), thus ensuring a prompt electron injection process. On the other hand, the redox potential of iodide/triiodide ions (−4.95 eV) is more positive than the HOMO energy levels of all the organic dyes (ranging from −5.28 to −5.16 eV), thereby facilitating efficient reduction of the oxidized dye. It was found that the electrochemical band gaps of 7a–7d and 11d–13d obtained in the film state conform to the trends of optical band gaps (7a > 7c > 7b > 7d and 13d > 12d > 11d > 7d) obtained from their absorption spectra. This further confirms that replacement of terminal donor and π-linker in the D–π–A framework controls the magnitude of the HOMO–LUMO gap.

The ground state geometries of all the dyes were optimized using the DFT method (Fig. S1–S7, ESI). From the results, we observed that the triarylamine moiety in starburst shaped dyes 7b, 7d, 11d–13d has a propeller geometry and the cyanoacrylic acid is coplanar with the thienyl moiety or phenyl unit. On the other hand, the electrons in the HOMO levels of the compounds are distributed over the electron-donating moiety, that is the triarylamine and/or carbazole fragment. Conversely, the LUMO levels of the compounds showed that electrons are distributed over the cyanoacrylic acid moiety of the dyes. Thus, we anticipated that efficient photoinduced charge separation and relatively stronger anchoring power would enhance the degree of electron injection to the TiO2 electrode. Furthermore, we found that a π-conjugated linker, such as 2,5-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)selenophene, 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene, 3-hexylthiophene and phenyl ring, as well as cyanoacrylic acid moieties, are involved in the frontier molecular orbitals. It was also shown that the energy levels of the LUMOs of the compounds are dependent on the nature of the π-conjugated linker in the compounds, whereas the energy levels of the HOMOs are not affected significantly by the identities of the π-conjugated linker which are consistent with the CV results. For example, the energy levels of the LUMO of 7d and 11d are −2.83 eV and −2.73 eV, respectively (Table S2, ESI). The decrease in energy level of LUMO for 7d can be attributed to the more extended delocalization of electrons for the selenophene moiety in the LUMO of 7d compared with 11d.


All the DSSCs with an effective area of 0.126 cm2 were prepared according to conventional procedures, as described in the Experimental section, and tested under standard conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The DSSCs were fabricated by anchoring our new organic dyes and reference dye N719 accordingly onto nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 as the photoanode and the liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2 in a mixture of acetonitrile and 4-tert-butylpyridine (volume ratio, 1:1). Their basic device performance parameters, such as PCE, Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are depicted in Table 3. Fig. 4 and 5 display the photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V curves) and incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, respectively.

The highest PCE of 6.67% (Jsc = 11.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.825 V, FF = 0.721) was obtained with dye 11d, attaining 84% of the reference ruthenium dye N719-based cell (PCE = 7.91%) measured under the same conditions. The PCEs of DSSCs based on other organic dyes are in the range of 3.04–6.60%. The Jsc, Voc, and FF values are in the range of 5.60–13.77 mA cm−2, 0.660–0.825 V, and 0.703–0.751, respectively. Impressively, the Voc of 11d exceeds the value of N719 (Voc = 0.701 V) by 0.124 V and this Voc value is remarkably high among the iodide/triiodide redox couple-based DSSCs. Notably, the Voc values of all starburst donor-based dyes are higher than that of the non-starburst donor-based dye 7a, and this implies that such starburst donor molecular design can effectively improve the photovoltaic performance of D–π–A dyes by elevating the Voc. Moreover, 7a–7d with selenophene as the elongated π-linker unit present higher Jsc values than do 11d–13d, implying that uncommon selenophene may be a useful π-linker building block to augment the Jsc. Meanwhile, the action response range of IPCE spectra among the seven new organic photosensitizers is around 310–700 nm and the IPCE curves conform well to the absorption profiles of organic dyes after taking the common J-aggregate formation of organic dyes into consideration. The IPCE values exceed 50% from 400 to 550 nm for all the organic dyes, except for 13d. In addition, the maximum IPCE value attained by 12d is larger than 65% at 475 nm, but the corresponding IPCE curve rolls off sharply from 600 to 650 nm. And this explains the low Jsc value attained compared with 7a–7d and 11d, which have more intense action responses within 600–700 nm in the long wavelength region. In other words, this accounts for the higher Jsc values attained by 7a–7d.
This result indicates that broadening the light harvesting region by elongating π-conjugation length and placing π-linkers with increasing electron donating power (phenyl ring < 3-hexylthiophene < 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene < 2,5-bis(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)selenophene) is an effective way to increase the Jsc in the order 13d < 12d < 11d < 7d. This is in agreement with most traditional D–π–A organic photosensitizers found in the literature. On the other hand, it is reasonable to expect that the Jsc values of 7a–7d vary much less because of their very similar absorption properties. Besides, the Voc values measured in these dyes are highly dependent on the selection of terminal donor. The Voc values of all starburst donor-based dyes (7b–7d and 11d–13d) are higher than that of the non-starburst donor-based dye 7a, and this is ascribed to the following. Firstly, the prolongation of rod-like D–π–A molecules in 7a may facilitate the charge recombination of electrons to I3− with the formation of dye-aggregates, thus reducing the Voc. Secondly, charge recombination may also occur between electrolyte and the semiconducting TiO2 photoanode, thus reducing the theoretical potential difference between the electrolyte and TiO2. To suppress these two unfavorable processes, starburst structural design of donor was used to prevent the π-stacked aggregation and to form a compact hydrophobic layer between the hydrophilic I−/I3− redox electrolyte and the surface of TiO2, which can block the backward electron transfer for maintaining a high Voc value.
To assess the interfacial charge recombination process in DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used under dark conditions for 7a–7d and 11d–13d, with the corresponding data shown in Table 4, and Fig. 6 and 7. In the EIS Nyquist plot, seven semicircles for 7a–7d and 11d–13d were recorded. This plot reveals the resistance of electron recombination (Rrec) at the interfaces between the redox couples/sensitizers/TiO2. If the radius of the semicircle is shorter, a smaller value of Rrec will be calculated from the Nyquist plot, and this implies that the recombination kinetics is faster. The Rrec values of 7b–7d and 11d–13d, which consist of starburst donor, are larger than that of non-starburst donor-based 7a, thereby suggesting that 7a suffers from more serious charge recombination while 11d is most potent to restrain the charge recombination. Simultaneously, these results match the trend of their Voc values, and disubstituted triphenylamine linked with two 9-hexylcarbazole units at the 3-position as a novel starburst donor is potent to weaken the dye aggregation on TiO2 and also the interaction between liquid electrolyte (I−/I3−) and TiO2 in these D–π–A photosensitizers.

In addition to the EIS Nyquist plot, an EIS Bode plot was used to extract the angular frequency (ωrec) at the mid-frequency peak using the equation below, in which fmax correlates to the peak frequency.
From the equation, the electron lifetimes (τe) of DSSCs can be estimated. The τe estimation reflects the charge recombination rate at the interface of DSSCs. Interestingly, the τe values of dyes 7a–7d with selenophene as part of the π-linker are much smaller than those of 11d–13d without selenophene in their structures. Furthermore, the Rrec values of 11d–13d are larger than those of 7a–7d by one order of magnitude and this doubly confirms that selenophene plays a pivotal role in determining the photovoltage by varying the charge recombination kinetics. This phenomenon indicates that the presence of selenophene drives the decline of Voc regardless of the structure of the terminal donor, hence some unknown interactions induced by selenophene are expected to occur so as to enhance the charge recombination process and hence lower the Voc. Recently, a similar result was reported using selenophene-containing Ru complex photosensitizer, and the corresponding findings were ascribed to adduct formation between oxidized iodide(s) and the selenophene moiety in the photosensitizer. Spectroscopic studies identified that a 4-fold-larger and second-order rate constant measured for the reaction between triiodide ions and TiO2 (e−) accounted for this phenomenon, as compared with the use of thiophene as the π-conjugated linker.
To further analyze the kinetics of charge recombination of DSSC devices, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was used to illustrate the electron lifetime (τn), which is estimated from the OCVD curve from a steady state to equilibrium in darkness. The OCVD profiles of 7a–7d and 11d–13d are depicted in Fig. 8. The equation shown below interprets the relationship between τn and OCVD curves, where e, T, and kB denote the electron charge, temperature, and Boltzmann constant, respectively.
The slope of the decay curve in the OCVD plot correlates the τn value, and the less steep curve suggests the longer electron lifetime accordingly. It is obvious that the curves of 7d and 11d–13d with disubstituted triphenylamine linked with two 9-hexylcarbazole units at the 3-position as starburst donor are less steep than those of 7a–7c and N719. This provides a strong evidence to support the interfacial charge recombination improvement by the novel starburst donor structure, thus prolonging the electron lifetime (τn) and elevating the Voc value in each of the organic photosensitizers. Again, weakening the dye aggregation and formation of the protective, compact and hydrophobic layer between hydrophilic redox couples and the TiO2 photoanode using starburst donor molecular design might best explain such variation in the photovoltaic performance.

A series of new D–π–A organic photosensitizers based on starburst triarylamine donor and selenophene-containing π-linker were designed and synthesized, with investigations made of the effects of combinations of new or reported electron donors and π-linkers. All the photosensitizers were fully characterized by spectroscopic studies. The PCEs of these organic dyes ranged from 3.04% to 6.67% under standard conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mV cm−2). The best performance of the device is achieved using the dye 11d with a novel starburst donor structure, with PCE value attaining 84% of that of N719-based DSSC (7.91%) fabricated under the same conditions. The corresponding Voc achieved for 11d is 0.825 V and this is greater than that of N719 (0.710 V) by 0.124 V. All the photovoltaic performances were verified using IPCE curves, EIS, and OCVD studies. The influences towards DSSCs driven by selenophene as a π-linker unit were explored and evaluated. It is evident that the selection of starburst donor is essential to modulate both light harnessing ability and the charge recombination process at the interfaces, thus accounting for a clear improvement in device performance. Although the device performance obtained is not as high as that of standard ruthenium complex photosensitizer, elucidation of the structure–property relationship is worthwhile for future improvements towards better organic photosensitizers, particularly in the design of organic dyes with high Voc. Synthesis of new starburst donor-based organic dyes with broader light harvesting regions, and their DSSC fabrication, is now ongoing in our group.


All reactions were performed under an inert N2 atmosphere with the use of a Schlenk line. Glassware was dried in an oven prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without purification unless otherwise stated. All the reagents for chemical synthesis were purchased from Acros Organics, Sigma-Aldrich, and Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (TCI). Solvents were purified by distillation over suitable drying agents. All the reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with Merck pre-coated aluminum plates. Products were purified and separated by column chromatography with silica gel (230–400 mesh) purchased from Merck.


Proton and carbon NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on a Bruker Ultra-shield 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer, and tetramethylsilane (TMS) was used as an internal standard for calibrating the chemical shift. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were performed on an Autoflex Bruker MALDI-TOF system. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using a Potentiostat/Galvanostat/EIS Analyzer model Parstat 4000 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. UV/Vis absorption spectra were performed on a Hewlett Packard 8453 spectrometer in CH2Cl2 solution at 293 K.


All the calculations in this work were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package. The ground state geometries of all the dyes in dichloromethane (ε = 8.93) were optimized using the density functional theory (DFT) method with hybrid functional PBE0, and the solvation effects were included using the integral equation formalism (IEF) version of the polarizable continuum (PCM) model. Frequency calculations were then performed to confirm that each optimized structure was the real minimum without imaginary vibration frequency. The time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) method was used to calculate vertically excited singlet-state energies. The 6-31G(d) basis set was adopted. The absorption profiles were calculated using the Multiwfn program as a sum of Gaussian-shaped bands with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) equal to 0.667 eV.


All the anode films for the DSSCs were made using the same standard manner, and were composed of a 12 μm-thick transparent layer (TiO2 with diameter of 20 nm) and 6 μm-thick scattering layer (TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 200 nm). The doctor-blade technique was used to prepare photoanode (TiO2) films. First, a layer of ∼6 μm TiO2 paste (20 nm) was doctor-bladed onto the FTO conducting glass and then relaxed at room temperature for 3 min before heating at 150 °C for 6 min; this procedure was repeated once to achieve a film thickness of ∼12 μm and the resulting surface was finally coated by a scattering layer (∼6 μm) of TiO2 paste (200 nm). The electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 275 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, and 470 °C for 30 min to remove polymers and generate a three-dimensional TiO2 nanoparticle network. After that, the sintered films were soaked with 0.02 M TiF4 aqueous solution for 45 min at 70 °C, washed with deionized water, and further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to ∼80 °C, the electrodes were immersed into a 5 × 10−4 M dye bath in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio, 1:1) for the dyes 7a–7d, 11d–13d and maintained in the dark for 12 h. Afterwards, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove the non-adsorbed dyes and dried in the air. Pt counter electrodes were prepared by the sputtering method at 15 mA for 90 s at a power of 150 W. Two holes (0.75 mm in diameter) were predrilled in the FTO glass for introducing the electrolyte. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt parafilm at about 100 °C. Liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 in a mixture of acetonitrile and 4-tert-butylpyridine (volume ratio, 1:1) was introduced into the cell through the drilled holes at the back of the counter electrode. The holes were sealed by parafilm and covering glass (0.1 mm thickness) at elevated temperature. The effective areas of all the TiO2 electrodes were ∼0.126 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled DSSCs were measured using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 236) at room temperature in air under the spectral output from solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. IPCEs of DSSCs were recorded in the Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) using dc mode. A CHI 660D electrochemical workstation was used to characterize the electrochemical properties of the DSSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded under dark conditions over a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV, and the parameters were calculated from Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner Associates, Inc.). For the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements, the cell was first illuminated for 20 s to achieve a steady voltage, and then the illumination was turned off for 90 s and the OCVD curve was obtained.

The reaction mixture was poured into water, followed by extraction using ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was then removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a 1:10 mixture of CH2Cl2 and hexane as eluent to afford compound 3 (0.62 g, 1.337 mmol) as a pale yellow solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 7.17 (s, 2H, Ar), 6.94 (s, 2H, Ar), 6.79 (s, 2H, Ar), 2.57 (t, 4H, J = 7.6 Hz, alkyl), 1.66–1.58 (m, 4H, alkyl), 1.37–1.32 (m, 12H, alkyl), 0.91–0.88 (t, 6H, J = 6.8 Hz, alkyl); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 144.20, 141.17, 139.04, 126.00, 125.62, 119.28 (Ar), 31.69, 30.53, 30.37, 29.01, 22.64, 14.14 ppm (alkyl).


The Vilsemier Haack reagent was first prepared in a two-necked round-bottom flask containing dry DMF (0.489 g, 6.685 mmol). POCl3 (0.246 g, 1.604 mmol) was added dropwise by syringe at 0 °C. A solution of 3 (0.62 g, 1.337 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (20 mL) was added dropwise to the prepared Vilsmeier–Haack reagent under a N2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at 0 °C and then heated overnight at 70 °C.
