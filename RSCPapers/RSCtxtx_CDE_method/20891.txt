A newly synthesized benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene-based low band-gap copolymer pBCN is amenable to solvent annealing in the fabrication of organic photovoltaics, of which power conversion efficiency is greatly improved to 4.2% with PC61BM or 4.9% with PC71BM.

Thermal annealing or solvent annealing is a powerful nanomorphology control on polymer-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The most successful example is poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT) and fullerene, either [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). With either thermal or solvent annealing treatment on P3HT/PCBM BHJ OPVs, power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be greatly improved from normally less than 2% to more than 5%. It is generally believed that the unique regioregular (rr) structure of P3HT is the reason for such an annealing treatment being so effective for the P3HT/fullerene system. In recent years, a series of benzodithiophene (BDT)-based low band-gap polymers have achieved PCE over 7%. However, none of these high PCE BDT-based polymers is applicable for thermal or solvent annealing in OPVs. Herein we report the first benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene (BDT)-based low band-gap polymer pBCN (Scheme 1) that is applicable for solvent annealing treatment. Unlike P3HT or other poly(3-alkyl)thiophene polymers, pBCN is not a polymer with rr structural feature. In this communication, we will try to provide some reasons or evidences that explain why a non-rr low band-gap polymer BHJ OPVs has effectively enhanced PCE by solvent annealing treatment.

Introduction of the electron-withdrawing cyano- (CN–) group has been proven an efficient chemical approach to narrow the energy band-gap (Eg) of π-conjugated polymers. Both HOMO and LUMO energy levels are lowered compared to the analogues without cyano-groups. Several BDT-containing polymer-based organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have been reported with good carrier mobility owing to planar and symmetrical BDT structure, which benefits charge transport. We report herein a novel low band-gap donor–acceptor copolymer, pBCN (Scheme 1), based on the combination of BDT donor and the cyanovinyl (CNV) acceptor. pBCN exhibits a small energy band-gap and a deep HOMO energy level, which are two important prerequisites for high efficiency BHJ OPVs.
The synthetic route of pBCN is outlined in Scheme 1. pBCN was prepared through Stille cross coupling between comonomers of distannyl-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene (D1) and dibromothienylcyanovinyl (A1). A branched alkyl group, 2-ethylhexyl, is substituted on both donor and acceptor moieties to enhance the polymer solubility. The donor moiety D1 was synthesized according to literature procedures. The acceptor moiety A1 was synthesized through Knoevenagel condensation from the acetonitrile- and aldehyde-containing bromo(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene unit (see ESI for their synthesis and characterization). Considering its high molecular weight (Mw = 91.7 kg mol−1, Mn = 39.6 kg mol−1), GPC reveals pBCN with a reasonably small polydispersity index (PDI = 2.32) after the copolymer purification by a series of Soxhlet solvent extractions. The copolymer can be readily dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzne at room temperature and it exhibits an excellent film-forming property.

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of pBCN in chlorobenzene, a neat film, and a composite thin film containing PC61BM. In solution, pBCN has λmax absorption peaked at 547 nm and exhibits a significant red-shifted absorption in its thin film (after solvent evaporation) showing λmax at 580 nm with a vibronic absorption shoulder clearly emerging around 640 nm. In the presence of PC61BM but without solvent annealing treatment, the 640 nm absorption shoulder band of the pBCN thin film is relatively low in intensity. Visually pBCN exhibits a deep magenta colour in chlorobenzene solution at RT and a dark-blue colour in the solvent-free thin film state (right inset of Fig. 1). The pronounced colour changes observed for pBCN from solution to the solvent-free thin film is very similar to that of well-known rr-P3HT either spectroscopically or visually, except longer wavelength as found for pBCN than P3HT.
Such spectroscopic or colour changes can be attributed to the contact interaction between polymer chains in the solid state (thin film). It is well documented that the arylene–CNCC–arylene moieties readily form C–H⋯N or local dipole–dipole interactions with the fluorescent molecules having so-called aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE). Based on the absorption spectra discussed above, PC61BM seems to partially interfere with such interaction between polymer chains, although such interference can be mostly removed by solvent annealing treatment. Solvent annealing is known to be effective in the segregation of rr-P3HT and PC61BM. From atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface images of pBCN/PC61BM (1:1, w/w) thin films (Fig. 2), solvent annealing seems to exert similar morphological effects on the pBCN and PC61BM systems.
The optical band-gap (Eg) of pBCN, calculated from its thin film absorption onset, is 1.82 eV (∼680 nm). The redox behavior of pBCN was investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry in its thin film state. The cyclic voltammogram (using Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode) of pBCN exhibits a high oxidation potential of 1.05 V (Fig. S1, ESI). With the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (0.40 V vs.Ag/Ag+) as the standard of HOMO energy level (−4.8 eV), this corresponds to a HOMO energy level of −5.45 eV for pBCN. The deep HOMO energy level of pBCN suggests that a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of OPVs can be obtained.

pBCN OPVs were fabricated with a structure of ITO|PEDOT:PSS|pBCN:fullerene (1:1)|Ca|Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OPVs were recorded under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. The results of pBCN OPVs fabricated with or without solvent annealing and with two different fullerene-based electron acceptors (PC61BM or PC71BM) are demonstrated in Table 1 and Fig. 3. It was found that all devices exhibit fairly large open circuit voltages from 0.82 to 0.90 V in accordance with deep HOMO energy level of pBCN. Device A shows moderate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.96% when PC61BM was used as the acceptor and no annealing process was applied during device fabrication. With the process of solvent annealing (allowing the wet film to slowly dry in a covered Petri dish for 60 min), the PCE of pBCN OPV (device B) is significantly increased to 4.20%. From electrical characteristics of the devices, the main reason for the increased PCE is the largely enhanced short circuit current density (JSC), although both VOC and fill factor (FF) are slightly decreased compared to the device A without solvent annealing. The reduced VOC in device B is also in line with the lowered band-gap energy (and rising HOMO energy level) of solvent annealed pBCN. In addition, device B shows a larger shunt resistance (RSH) and a significantly smaller series resistance (RS) than those of device A. This indicates that pBCN OPV exhibits a better charge transporting characteristics with solvent annealing treatment.

From the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plot of the solvent-annealed pBCN|PC61BM device, an enhanced photocurrent in all radiation wavelengths is observed compared with the device without solvent annealing (Fig. 4). Particularly, the solvent-annealed device displays an enlarged photocurrent shoulder band around 640 nm. Such an EQE spectral feature is consistent with the absorption spectra of pBCN/PC61BM mixed films with solvent annealing.

pBCN OPVs can be further improved by using PC71BM as the electron acceptor because of its stronger absorption in the visible region compared to PC61BM. Although there is only a modest increase of JSC, the PCE of device C is improved from 4.20 to 4.88%. This is mainly due to its largely enhanced FF, which is in turn because of greatly reduced RS. Usually, this is an indication of better charge transport in the OPV active layer due to the optimal nano-morphology resulting from aggregation of electron donor and acceptor materials. Device C has enhanced EQE in the range of 400–500 nm compared with that of PC61BM OPV, which is in accordance with better visible light absorption of PC71BM than PC61BM. Even though a photocurrent shoulder band around 640 nm is also present, the maximum EQE in the range of 550–650 nm is lower than that of PC61BM OPV. Although better in charge transporting (as suggested by higher FF and smaller RS), less efficient charge separation of pBCN exciton or more severe charge recombination (as implied from lower RSH of device C) may be detrimental factors in pBCN/PC71BM.
The hole mobility of pBCN was examined by organic field effect transistors (OFETs) with a top-contact device structure. Gold source and drain electrodes were deposited on the SiO2/Si substrate prior to spin-coating of the polymer thin film. The pBCN OFETs exhibit hole mobility as high as 4.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 5). The current on–off ratio and threshold voltage (VT) is near 104 and 3.6 V, respectively. Somewhat lower hole mobility of 4.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was found for the pBCN/PC61BM (1:1) blend OFETs (Fig. S2, ESI). Such hole mobility data are close to those of P3HT and P3HT/PC61BM OFETs in literature, indicative of similar charge transporting characteristics of pBCN in fullerene-based OPVs.
In summary, a novel benzodithiophene-thiophene-cyanovinylene copolymer pBCN has been designed and synthesized as the electron donor material in polymer solar cells. It is rare that the solvent annealing process is effectively applicable for improving performance of BDT-based low band-gap pBCN OPVs. The significantly enhanced PCE is due to the obvious increase of JSC (or reduction of RS), which is attributed to the solvent annealing-induced advantageous nano-morphology that facilitates the charge transporting and long wavelength absorption of the materials. Our preliminary tests based on pBCN/PC71BM photovoltaic devices have demonstrated that PCE as high as 4.88% can be reached. Optimizing the device configuration and fine-tuning the solubilizing alkyl chains will be continued in further investigations.
