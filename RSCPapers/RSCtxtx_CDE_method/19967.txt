Isomeric dicyanovinylene-terminated oligothiophenes 1 and 2 comprising a central dithienopyrrole (DTP) unit have been developed for solution-processed small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) giving the highest power conversion efficiency of 4.8% for DTP-based oligomeric materials.

The last few years have seen great progress in the use of solution-processable and structurally defined conjugated oligomers, referred to as “small molecules”, as light harvesting materials in organic solar cells. Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 9% have been reached primarily due to the development of better light-absorbing donor oligomers. Most of these consist of alternating donor (D) and acceptor (A) units in the π-conjugated backbone, such as oligothiophenes, ring-fused dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]siloles, or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes for D, and dicyanovinylene, diketopyrrolopyrroles, pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole, rhodanine, or cyanoacrylic ester for A moieties. In contrast, the fused and electron-rich dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) unit has rarely been used as a building block in p-type semiconducting oligomers reaching only moderate efficiencies of 0.2–1.3% in SMOSCs.

In this communication, we now describe synthesis, characterization, and photovoltaic application of two novel A–D–A oligothiophenes 1 and 2 comprising a central DTP unit and dicyanovinylene (DCV) as terminal acceptor groups. The motivation to implement DTP units in A–D–A oligothiophenes is a high charge-transfer character and thus a red-shift of the longest wavelength absorption, which should be favourable for solar cells. The structural concept of A–D–A oligothiophenes has been very successfully used in vacuum-processed SMOSCs and is now transferred to solution-processable oligomers. In this respect, oligomers 1 and 2 were designed such that solubilizing side chains were introduced at the central nitrogen (2-ethylhexyl) and regioregularly at each residual thiophene ring (n-hexyl) of the hexamer as a mimic of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene). The two isomeric oligomers now only differ in the positioning of the hexyl side chains, which are directed “outward” in 1 and “inward” in 2. Good solubilities (≥10 mg mL−1) have thus been obtained and solution-processed BHJ solar cells based on 1 displayed an excellent PCE of 4.8% and a high fill factor of 0.66. The influence of the positions of the hexyl side chains on device performance is discussed. An A–D–A-type hexamer containing a central DTP unit and terminal cyano acrylic acid groups was recently used in dye-sensitized solar cells showing a moderate efficiency of 1.24%.
The new oligomers 1 and 2 were synthesized according to Scheme 1. N-(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole 4 was prepared by Pd0-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig coupling of 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene 3 and 2-ethylhexyl amine in a yield of 92%. Corresponding bis-stannylated dithienopyrrole 5 was obtained by lithiation of 4 using n-BuLi followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride. The synthetic route used to obtain 6 and 7 is described in the ESI (Schemes S1 and S2). Oligomers 1 and 2 were finally synthesized by Pd0-catalyzed Stille-type coupling of 5 with dicyanovinylene (DCV)-substituted iodobithiophene 6 and bromobithiophene 7. After final purification by HPLC, oligomers 1 and 2 were obtained in 84% and 74% yield, respectively.
Electronic absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in dichloromethane are shown in Fig. 1 and data are summarized in Table 1. DTP-sexithiophene 1 showed an intensive charge-transfer absorption band at 593 nm with a molar extinction coefficient ε of 70100 L mol−1 cm−1 whereas the maximum absorption of constitutional isomer 2 is blue-shifted to 562 nm and less intensive (ε = 58700 L mol−1 cm−1) (Table 1). This is due to steric hindrance of the “inward” hexyl side chains with the DTP moiety. Compared to the solution spectra, the bands of 1 and 2 as thin films prepared by spin-coating from chloroform solutions are significantly red-shifted to 698 and 700 nm (Fig. 1), respectively, indicating ordering of the molecules in the bulk. The improved vibronic resolution of the absorption of oligomer 1 might arise from a better packing in the thin film. The optical band gaps Eoptg for 1 and 2 were 1.61 and 1.55 eV, respectively, which are lower compared to the band gaps Eoptg (1.82 eV) in solution.

Cyclic voltammetry of oligomers 1 and 2 was performed in dichloromethane (Fig. S1, ESI) and the detailed data are summarized in Table 1. Both oligomers showed two reversible 1e− oxidation waves, which can be assigned to the stepwise oxidation of the oligomeric backbone and the formation of stable radical cations and dications, respectively. In the negative potential regime, one irreversible reduction wave at −1.50 V is visible, which corresponds to the simultaneous reduction of the acceptor groups (Table 1). HOMO and LUMO energy levels of compounds 1 and 2 were calculated from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction wave, respectively. The HOMO energy levels are very similar for both oligomers (−5.30 eV), whereas the LUMO energy of 2 (−3.75 eV) is lower compared to 1 (−3.68 eV) leading to a smaller electrochemical band gap ECVg for 2 (1.55 eV vs. 1.60 eV).
The photovoltaic properties of oligomers 1 and 2 were investigated using a standard device structure based on blends with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). The current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots are displayed in Fig. 2, whereas Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic data as well as the average PCE over at least 12 devices. A more detailed table showing the effect of varying the oligomer:fullerene content in the photoactive layer is given in Table S1 (ESI). An oligomer:PCBM ratio of 1:2 spin-coated from chloroform yielded the best performance for both oligomers. The data clearly show that for oligomer 1 (“outward”) all solar cell parameters are by far better. A higher short circuit current density (JSC, 8.8 vs. 3.4 mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (VOC, 0.83 vs. 0.72 V), and fill factor (FF, 0.66 vs. 0.33) resulted in a significantly larger PCE of 4.8% for DTP derivative 1 compared to 0.8% for 2. The surprisingly large discrepancy between the devices based on the two oligomers 1 and 2 will be discussed below upon consideration of the morphology of the photoactive layers. The good JSC (8.8 mA cm−2) and very high FF (0.66) of 1:PC61BM devices are indicative of both high and balanced electron and hole transport in the blend.

It is noteworthy to mention that we found the performance of solar cells made of 1 to be quite sensitive to the active layer thickness and film uniformity over the device area. This is demonstrated in Fig. S3 (ESI) showing an image of the cross section of such a 1:PC61BM blend and in Fig. S2 (ESI) where the PCE is plotted against the active layer thickness.
In Fig. 2b, the EQE plots of 1:PC61BM and 2:PC61BM based devices are shown. Both oligomers display two maxima at short (∼400 nm) and long wavelengths (∼600–700 nm). DTP-oligomer 1 showed a maximum EQE of 43%, whereas isomer 2 as expected showed a reduced maximum EQE of 24% at around 390 nm due to its much lower JSC (3.4 mA cm−2).
In order to investigate the surface characteristics of the active layer blend films, AFM investigations were carried out. The samples were prepared in the same way as the photoactive layers for the solar cell devices. Fig. 3a depicts the characteristic long range topography images for both blend films: 1:PC61BM (Fig. 3a) showed a regular grain-structured surface. The 2:PC61BM blend (Fig. 3d and inset), however, showed a flatter topography with few crystallites on top. The short range images in Fig. 3b and c and Fig. 3e and f underline the differences in film characteristics: the surface of 1:PC61BM (Fig. 3b) is composed of fine aligned fibers (∼20 nm ± 2 nm) with a 32 nm ± 1 nm height profile. In contrast, the 2:PC61BM (Fig. 3e) blend showed an almost flat surface (2.0 nm ± 0.2 nm) on top of which 40–250 nm size crystallites can be identified. The corresponding phase image (Fig. 3f) shows almost no contrast (4° ± 0.2°) demonstrating a completely mixed film. The borders of the crystallites on top show a higher phase contrast compared with their center and the mixed phase (25° ± 1°, inset Fig. 3f). In the phase images of 1:PC61BM (Fig. 3c), fiber domains with an averaged contrast of 18° can be identified. It is possible to assign the lighter regions (higher phase shift) to areas with mostly donor oligomer 1, whereas the darker regions (lower phase shift) contain mostly acceptor PC61BM. The analysis of the phase images reveals domains ∼20 nm in size for the higher phase shift. We conclude that the photoactive blends containing DTP-oligomer 1 phase-separate into domains of approximately 20 nm in size, whereas on the surface of oligomer 2-based blends, no phase separation of the two components can be observed. In the latter very finely mixed blend, recombination of the generated charges during solar cell operation should occur as a result of the lack of percolation pathways. A significant amount of recombination in 2:PC61BM devices is consistent with the rather low fill factor (0.33) and short-circuit current density (3.4 mA cm−2) as well as the reduced open-circuit voltage (0.72 V, see Table 2).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured for films of 1:PC61BM and 2:PC61BM on PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates. In both cases, the low-angle reflections can be ascribed to the presence of some crystallites of the oligomer (Fig. S4, ESI). The d-spacing, which correlates to the separation of the thiophene backbones and depends on the length and orientation of the side chains, was determined to be 15.0 Å for 1:PC61BM and 15.6 Å for 2. This is lower than typically observed for regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (∼16 Å) indicating a denser packing through a better interdigitation of the hexyl chains, which seems to be even better in 1 compared to 2. A smaller FWHM (full width at half maximum) value and higher intensity of the reflection of the 2:PC61BM system show larger crystallites than in the case of the 1:PC61BM blend, in agreement with the AFM images (Fig. 3d and inset), where some aggregates can be observed on the surface.
In summary, we have synthesized the novel A–D–A oligothiophenes 1 and 2 based on dithieno[3,2-b:2,3-d]pyrrole (DTP) as a central donor unit and on dicyanovinylene acceptors as end-caps. The only difference between the two structural isomers showing interesting and nearly the same optoelectronic properties is the positioning of the regioregular hexyl side chains either “outward” in 1 or “inward” in 2. Surprisingly, this marginal change led to a big difference in photovoltaic device performance. An excellent PCE of 4.8% has been achieved for DTP-oligomer 1 in SMOSCs which by far is the highest efficiency obtained for any DTP-based conjugated oligomeric material. In contrast, DTP-oligomer 2 based SMOSCs showed rather poor performances (PCE 0.8%), which we attribute to the very different blend morphology and phase separation, probed by AFM and XRD-techniques. These investigations show the importance of the electron-rich DTP unit as a promising building block in D–A-type conjugated systems giving rise to a larger CT-character and red-shift of the main absorption band and that subtle fine-tuning of the solubilizing side chains is necessary for obtaining highly efficient SMOSCs. Detailed investigations of the device performance by further careful optimization of the processing conditions are currently in progress and will be reported in due course.
