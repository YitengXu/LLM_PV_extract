Introducing an anti-reflective coating (ARC) is the last step of fabricating Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells with enhanced photo-generated current by reducing the reflectance of visible light. The use of nanostructures in ARC has been intensively investigated because this can prolong the optical path length by a scattering effect or by the formation of a refractive index gradient. Herein, we proposed the use of TiO2 helical nanostructures using glancing angle deposition (GLAD), and then synthesized SiO2 surrounding the helical nanostructures to further decrease the reflectance by producing a refractive index gradient. The optimized values of TiO2 and SiO2 thicknesses are 150 nm and 3 nm determined by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. The suppression of reflectance led to enhanced light absorption across a broad wavelength range, and boosted the JSC from 20.66 to 22.51 mA cm−2, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 6.32 to 7.00% after applying the TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructures as the ARC. This 10.75% PCE enhancement suggests that the novel TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructures have great potential as ARC for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells, and it would be beneficial for development in the photovoltaic field in both research and applications.

The depletion of the world's fossil fuel sources is a major problem in terms of energy resources, and utilizing the unlimited availability of solar power is a potential way to address this issue. Copper indium gallium selenide (Cu(In,Ga)Se2) thin-film solar cells are a major subject of interest within the field of photovoltaics due to their high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) in ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared regions, meaning that they can strongly absorb sunlight. It has been reported that the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin-film solar cells attained up to now is 22.9% announced by Solar Frontier. Furthermore, the long-term stability of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 modules in outdoor facilities has been proved by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). It is commonly known that the last step of the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell fabrication process is the placement of an anti-reflective coating (ARC) on top of the device to trap light in the device and increase the optical path length in order to enhance the generated photocurrent.

Acting as a single-layer ARC, magnesium fluoride (MgF2) is frequently employed for commercial Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells because its refractive index (nMgF2 ≅ 1.3) is close to the geometric mean between the refractive index of the transparent conductive layers (nTCO) and air (nair), thus resulting in the lowest reflectance. The thickness (T) of MgF2 can be determined by the equation  (k = 1, 3, 5,…) for destructive interference and minimum reflectance at a specific wavelength (λ). However, the performance of a single-layer ARC is limited since it is only applicable at a particular wavelength dependent on the selected thickness, and the anti-reflective effect can be adversely affected when the incident angle of the light changes. Calculations such as that conducted by Rayleigh (1879) have shown that a multi-layer ARC can reduce the reflectance in a wide spectral region by producing a refractive index gradient, which can be controlled well with the combination of several materials. Multi-layer ARC made by this concept has been extensively used in various fields such as solar cells, displays, and optical facilities. In addition, considerable research efforts have been dedicated to nanostructured ARC, including a porous material, pyramidal structure, nanorod arrays, moth-eye arrays, and other nanostructures. It is believed that nanostructured ARC can provide omnidirectional anti-reflection due to the scattering effect and refractive index gradient. Many fabrication processes have been proposed for nanostructured ARC, such as hydrothermal technique, etching process, sol–gel process, and physical vapor deposition. Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) belongs to the field of physical vapor deposition, and it is one of the most powerful techniques for creating self-assembled nanostructures. When the substrate is tilted during the deposition process, vapor nucleates firstly on the substrate and then subsequent vapor is hindered from attaching vapor to a shadowing region, which is so-called the shadowing effect. Also, the material with low mobility is necessary for nanostructure formation to prevent the migration of atoms to fill the spaces between nanostructures created by the shadowing effect. Moreover, GLAD provides a variety of nanostructured morphologies including slanted column, vertical column, zigzag structure and helical structure, which can be achieved by tuning the deposition angle (α) and the rotation angle (φ) during deposition.
In this regard, a novel TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure by GLAD and chemical bath deposition was designed and demonstrated to achieve a nanostructured ARC with a refractive index gradient on the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 film in order to further decrease the reflectance of the incident solar light. Prior to the experimental results of ARC on the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation was carried out to find the optimized parameters of the titanium oxide-silicon oxide (TiO2–SiO2) nanostructure based on simulated JSC enhancement after adding the nanostructures. The device was then fabricated according to the parameters determined from the simulation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirms that TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructures were formed. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum reveals that the optical properties of the samples are in good agreement with the simulated results, suggesting that the simulation is reliable. Finally, a significant increase in the JSC can be observed from 20.66 to 22.51 mA cm−2 with 8.95% JSC enhancement, resulting in an increase in PCE from 6.32 to 7.00% with 10.75% efficiency enhancement. The enhancement can be comparable to that of commercial MgF2 anti-reflective coating, revealing that this novel nanostructured ARC could potentially be applied industrially.

Simulations were carried out using two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver Lumerical solutions software with perfectly matched layers (PML) along the z-axis and periodic boundary conditions (PBC) along the x-axis as the simulated boundary conditions at a mesh size of 1 nm per grid point. A plane wave source was placed vertically above the simulated device with wavelengths from 300 to 1200 nm, and a reflection monitor was inserted above the plane wave source. A monitor, which is utilized to compute effective refractive index, was placed at the ARC layer. The design of the simulated device refers to Fig. S1. The optical properties, including the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of SiO2, were taken from the “SiO2 (Glass)-Palik” default material database, and those of TiO2, ITO, i-ZnO, CdS, Cu(In,Ga)Se2, and Mo were taken from previous reports by Ribarsky et al., Kim et al., Koss et al., Malmström et al., Orgassa et al. and Lynch et al. and fitted by the material explorer of the FDTD solver. The absorption, short circuit current of the device and the reflectance of the transparent conductive oxides (TCO) layer with varying TiO2 and SiO2 thickness were studied in detail prior to fabrication.


The molybdenum (Mo) back electrode was deposited on a soda lime glass (SLG) by a two-stage sputtering process. A reactive co-sputtering process was applied to fabricate Cu(In,Ga)Se2 film by sputtering Cu–Ga, Cu and In targets under a Se atmosphere. The Se sources were from a thermal cracker, consisting of a Se reservoir and a heater to thermally evaporate the Se pellets at 250 °C. The temperature of the substrate was 550 °C, and the pressure of the reactive co-sputtering process was 7.5 mTorr. A cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer using cadmium sulfate and thiourea as precursors was then deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD). The following TCO layer including intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) and indium tin oxide (ITO) was fabricated by magnetron sputtering, and the aluminum (Al) top electrode was then deposited by evaporation.


TiO2 helical nanostructures were deposited on the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 device by the GLAD technique at an incident angle of 80°. The primary adsorbed molecules acted as hindrances on the substrate to prevent following vapor from attaching to the shadowing area, and finally formed self-assembled helical nanostructures. Afterwards, a SiO2 shell was fabricated by the Stöber method, using 95 ml of 0.5 mM tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) ethanol solution and 5 ml of 28 wt% ammonia water (NH4OH). This process was maintained for 6 h with mild stirring. After the reaction, the device was rinsed in deionized water after ultrasonic cleaning to remove any remaining reactant.


The Cu(In,Ga)Se2 devices were analyzed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM by JOEL, JSE-6500F), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM, using the JEOL JEM-3000F FEGTEM at 300 kV) to assess morphologies and composition of the TiO2–SiO2 nanostructures. Reflectance spectroscopy was conducted on a Hitachi U-4100 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer with an integrating-sphere accessory. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were conducted on an ULVAC-PHI PHI 5000 Versaprobe II using a scanning X-ray monochromator (Al anode) source, and the C 1s signal at 284.5 eV was used to calibrate the binding energy scale. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured by a Keithley 4200 system under an AM 1.5 solar simulator at room temperature, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the devices was measured using a Xenon lamp at 75 watts, an optical chopper, a monochromator and a lock-in amplifier.


The schematic diagram in Fig. 1 demonstrates the experimental processes and methods applied to TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructures on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. In brief, the fabricated Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cell (Fig. 1a) is firstly placed on the substrate holder of the GLAD device. As can be seen from Fig. 1b, the incident angle (α) defined by the angle between the substrate normal and the incident vapor flux. As the vapor attaches the substrate and nucleates as an island, the following vapor deposits on the top of the island instead of the shadowing region behind the island, which is so-called shadowing effect. The slanting nanostructure can be formed if the substrate is fixed during deposition. The formation of the helical nanostructure can be obtained if the substrate keeps rotating to change the growth direction of the nanostructures during deposition. In our case, we deposit the helical nanostructure on the device as shown in Fig. 1c. Then, the TiO2 nanostructures are placed into an ethanol solution containing TEOS as the precursor of a SiO2 shell and NH4OH was added to control the reaction rate as shown in Fig. 1d. Finally, TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructures are successfully fabricated on the device (Fig. 1e).

Before the fabrication process, FDTD simulation was carried out to calculate the impulse response across the solar spectrum, the power absorption and the enhanced JSC after the introduction of the TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructures. The absorption per unit volume (Pabs) can be calculated from the following equation:
(1)
where
ω is the angular frequency, E is the electric field and Im(ε) is the imaginary part of the permittivity. Since the photon energy is defined as ℏω and we assume that the all absorbed photons can completely contribute to electron–hole pairs generation (a photon generate an electron–hole pair), the ideal photo-generated current (IL) can be denoted as:

(2)
where
e is the elementary charge.Fig. 2a gives the Pabs of the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 devices with various TiO2 nanostructure thicknesses. Clearly, a 150 nm-thick TiO2 nanostructure can lead to a high intensity of Pabs in the range ∼500 to ∼1150 nm. Relatively low intensity of Pabs in the UV region is also found when 150 nm-thick TiO2 nanostructures were applied to the device. However, it cannot lead to a photo-generated current resulted from electron–hole pair generation in the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber because photons of wavelength less than ∼520 nm are absorbed by the CdS buffer layer before the incident light transports to the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber due to a higher band gap of the CdS buffer layer. In Fig. 2b, the enhanced JSC values were calculated at different TiO2 thicknesses by the equation , and it also indicates the highest JSC enhancement of ∼6% occurring in the case of 150 nm-thick TiO2. Hence, the optimized TiO2 thickness was chosen as 150 nm. Please note that the geometry of the helical nanostructure cannot highly affect the optimized parameters. Fig. S2 provides the helical and rod TiO2 nanostructure with various thicknesses, giving the same optimized thickness due to the similar effective refractive index of helical and rod TiO2 nanostructure. The simulated Pabs and JSC enhancement of various SiO2 shell thicknesses surrounding 150 nm TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2c and d. It seems that the Pabs values are very similar to those from the device without SiO2 due to the considerably thin shell thickness, which gives rise to a ∼0.15% enhancement in JSC as the highest improvement when applying 3 nm-thick SiO2. The space between the TiO2 nanostructures is around 15 nm, which means the thickest SiO2 can only be 7.5 nm, and the optimized 3 nm-thick SiO2 obtained from the simulation is feasible in the laboratory experiment. For the purpose of investigating the amount of absorption by the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer, the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity (|E|2), which is proportional to the Pabs, located in the absorber layer at 800 nm wavelength was calculated for the devices without nanostructure, with TiO2 nanostructure and with TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure, respectively. Fig. 2e shows a higher intensity of |E|2 after the addition of TiO2 nanostructures, and this high-intensity region can be further extended after the SiO2 shell coating was applied to the TiO2, confirming the increased absorption of photons in the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer with assistance of the TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure. In Fig. 2f, the height profile of the simulated effective refractive index (neff) at a wavelength of 800 nm indicates that the neff of the TiO2 nanostructure is ∼1.23 after the combination of TiO2 and air in the nanostructure. The neff can be raised to 1.30 in the case of TiO2–SiO2 nanostructure, which is attributed to a decreased ratio in air (nair = 1) due to the addition of SiO2 (nSiO2 = 1.5). We ascribe the enhanced absorption in the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer to two factors. Firstly, the reflectance of the device can be dropped by introducing an ARC with a refractive index between that of air and ITO (nITO = 1.8), and both TiO2 and TiO2–SiO2 nanostructures are appropriate ARCs in our case. In addition, the neff of TiO2–SiO2 nanostructure is much closer to the square root of the product of nair and nITO, which is beneficial to further reduction of the reflectance. Secondly, the material stacking sequence follows a gradual increase in the refractive index (nair < nSiO2 < nTiO2 < nITO), exhibiting a refractive-index gradient to suppress reflection. Note that the value of nSiO2 is close to the geometric mean between nair and nTiO2, resulting in a less reflective ARC.

After the optical characteristics of these nanostructures by the simulation were well studied, we applied the optimized material parameters of 150 nm-thick TiO2 and 3 nm-thick SiO2 to the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. Fig. 3a–c show SEM images focusing on the TCO layer of the pristine device, device with TiO2 nanostructure and device with TiO2–SiO2 nanostructure, suggesting ∼150 nm-thick nanostructures on top. Fig. 3d provides a typical low-magnification bright-field TEM image of the synthesized core–shell helical nanostructure, indicating the SiO2 shell thickness of 3.5 nm. Table 1 summarizes the corresponding compositions of point a (core material), b (shell material) and c (without core–shell material) in Fig. 3d, which were conducted by the STEM-EDS point analysis. The existence of a high-intensity Ti signal at point a, and of silicon and oxygen signals at b, indicate that the core–shell helical nanostructure consists of TiO2 and SiO2 as the core and shell materials, respectively. The absent Ti and Si signals confirm the non-existence of the TiO2–SiO2 nanostructure at point c, suggesting that the defined edge of the nanostructure in Fig. 3d is reasonable. Please note that the carbon signal results from the carbon film on the TEM grid, and the presence of the oxygen signal at point c is due to the physically adsorbed oxygen in air. In addition, the bonding strength and composition of the TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure were further studied by XPS as shown in Fig. S3. The Ti 2p spectrum including Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, located at 464.4 and 458.7 eV, respectively, can be assigned to TiO2, and the existence of a Si 2p signal located at a position of 102.9 eV is attributed to the SiO2. The O 1s peak can be consistently fitted by considering the presence of two chemical environments located at positions of 532.2 and 530.3 eV, corresponding to SiO2 and TiO2. The percentage of each element and the atomic ratio of Ti–O and Si–O calculated by the fitted peak area are summarized in Table S1, giving evidence for the stoichiometry of the TiO2–SiO2 nanostructure. To understand the optical properties of the fabricated nanostructures, TiO2 and TiO2–SiO2 were deposited on the TCO substrate for UV-Vis measurements (Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 3e, much lower reflectance can be found after the TiO2 nanostructure is deposited on the TCO substrate, and the reflectance enhancement spectrum suggests suppressed reflectance from 500 to 1200 nm after the addition of TiO2 (Fig. S5a). In comparison with the case of TiO2 nanostructures on TCO, the reflectance can be further reduced after forming the TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure across a broad wavelength range as shown in Fig. S5b. Although it shows higher reflectance in several wavelength regions, the integral areas under the reflectance curves still perform the lowest reflectance after introducing the TiO2–SiO2 nanostructure (Table S2). The difference between the experimental and simulated reflectance (Fig. 3e and f) is mainly due to the difference between actual and simulated devices. Both results show an identical trend, confirming the reliability of the FDTD simulation performed.

Fig. 4a shows typical J–V characteristics for pristine Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells and the devices using TiO2 and TiO2–SiO2 nanostructures as ARCs, and Table 2 summarizes average values for solar cell performance including open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) for each device. An actual cell area of 0.48 cm2 and six samples were measured for each condition. The obtained JSC values increase after introducing the TiO2 and TiO2–SiO2 nanostructures, corresponding to average enhancements of 5.95 and 8.95% in JSC compared to the pristine device, while the VOC and FF values are comparatively unchanged due to unvarying electrical properties. Consequently, the enhancement in cell performance is predominantly attributed to the reflectance suppression, leading to increasing PCE from 6.32 (pristine), to 6.78 (with TiO2), to 7.00% (with TiO2–SiO2). Fig. 4b provides the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement, suggesting a broad enhancement between ∼500 and 1100 nm with the addition of the TiO2 nanostructure. In particular, we observed a significant improvement at ∼600 nm and ∼800 nm, which is in good agreement with Fig. 2a, describing the increase in absorption of devices after adding the TiO2 nanostructure. The presence of the TiO2–SiO2 leads to further improvement in EQE, with a relatively narrow enhancement between ∼500 and 900 nm is in accordance with the UV-Vis spectrum as shown in Fig. 3e, indicating a higher reflectance at ∼900 nm due to Fabry–Perot interference after the formation of TiO2–SiO2. The enhancement in EQE measurements reveals an increased optical path length due to the reflectance reduction, in turn improving its effectiveness at generating electron–hole pairs.

In reviewing the literature, we summarize the JSC enhancement of single-layer, multi-layer, and nanostructured ARC applied to Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells in Fig. 5. The details of each ARC are summarized in Table 3. Single-layer MgF2 is often used for commercial Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells due to its appropriate refractive index, and Rajan et al. reported a 6.49% enhancement in JSC. Bae et al. investigated Teflon amorphous fluoropolymer (Teflon AF) as the ARC owing to its low refractive index and a facile fabrication method of spin coating, resulting in an increase of 3.8% in JSC. In order to realize broadband antireflection, Rajan et al. simulated multi-layer ARCs of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells with various stacked materials including MgF2/Al2O3, MgF2/SiO2/Al2O3, MgF2/Al2O3/TiO2 and MgF2/SiO2/TiO2/SiO2/TiO2. The calculated JSC can be further improved with increased stacking layers, in turn forming a refractive index gradient. Shimazaki et al. designed Al2O3/SiO2 by thermal evaporation and Li et al. developed TiO2–SiO2 stack coating using sol–gel dip-coating, showing 2.3% and 5.27% enhancement in JSC, respectively. With the new technological advance of nanostructure fabrication, the potential of nanostructured ARC is being extensively investigated for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. Rezaei et al. reported an interesting design of refractive index gradient by controlling the gradient level of porosity in a MgF2 ARC, giving a 6.81% JSC enhancement due to the broadband antireflection. Čampa et al. conducted numerical simulation to analyze the benefit of textured ZnO:Al front contact on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells, leading to a 7.3% enhancement in JSC due to the enhancement of the scattering and antireflective effect. Wang et al. proposed ZnO nanorods utilizing the aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) window layer as a seed layer for hydrothermal growth, an efficient non-vacuum solution process, yielding an 8.83% enhancement in JSC. Han et al. introduced a facile method for low-cost and low-temperature curable SiO2 nanoparticles as ARC by spin coating, providing a 3.51% enhancement in JSC. van Lare et al. developed a TiO2 pattern printed by substrate conformal imprint lithography, leading to a 4.20% JSC enhancement due to the light trapping effect. Compared to the previous literature, the TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure synthesized in our case unambiguously indicates a significant opportunity for both academic and industrial research.

Our work


In this work, we have demonstrated a facile method of TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure fabrication for the ARC on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. FDTD simulation shows optimized thicknesses of 150 nm TiO2 and 3 nm SiO2 based on the highest absorption of the devices and the corresponding JSC enhancements. The spatial distribution of the electric field inside the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer suggests an increased absorption offering charge carrier generation after ARC fabrication. The simulated effective refractive index of the TiO2 and TiO2–SiO2 shows that the anti-reflection effect is highly dependent on the effective refractive index. An actual device was fabricated according to the structure built in the simulation. Surface morphologies and composition of the nanostructures were investigated using SEM, TEM and XPS results, confirming the successful formation of the TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructure. In addition, reflectance measurements conducted by UV-Vis spectrophotometer were in agreement with the simulated reflectance, corroborating the reliability of the simulation. Finally, a remarkable enhancement in PCE, from 6.32 to 7.00%, can be attributed to the improved JSC from 20.56 to 22.51 mA cm−2 due to the reduced reflectance after introducing the ARC. We believe that this promising TiO2–SiO2 core–shell nanostructured ARC is compatible with other ARCs, which have been developed, and has a great potential for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells and other commercial applications.
