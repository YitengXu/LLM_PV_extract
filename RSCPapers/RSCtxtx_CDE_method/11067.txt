The treatment of a 3D perovskite film with 2D perovskite segments has been recognized as a promising approach to improve the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which have received much less attention in methylammonium (MA)-free devices than that in the MA-containing counterparts. We explored a novel fluorine-containing aromatic ammonium salt, 4-trifluorophenylammonium iodide (TFPAI) to form a 2D/3D junction on top of a Cs/FA-based perovskite. It was found that the hole and electron transport were more balanced for the 2D/3D configuration than for the pristine one, leading to a boosted fill factor (FF) and decreased hysteresis in the resultant devices. The formation of the 2D layer further increased the PL intensity, prolonged the carrier lifetimes, and significantly suppressed nonradiative recombination. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.7% was delivered for TFPAI modified devices with 2D/3D heterostructures, which is among the most efficient Cs/FA-based PSCs. Owing to the inherent hydrophobic characteristics of the 2D capping segment, the resultant PSCs exhibited remarkable moisture tolerance and thermal stability. This study provides an insight into the molecule design to deliver an efficient 2D/3D junction for high-performance PSCs.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have witnessed great development over the past decade in the field of thin-film solar cells, and the certificated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed to 25.5%. Currently, MA-containing perovskite materials are the most established and highly-efficient PSCs, whereas the MA+-containing perovskite materials are usually unstable under thermal aging and would decompose at high temperatures (e.g., ≥80 °C). It is thus attractive to fabricate stable and efficient PSCs with MA-free perovskite materials, e.g., Cs/FA-based perovskite. However, the PCEs of Cs/FA-based PSCs are always inferior to those of the MA-containing devices. Therefore, it is necessary to further elevate the performance of MA-free PSCs.

Defects are one of the important factors hindering the device performance of PSCs, which are commonly distributed in the bulk and/or at the surface of the perovskite films, including vacancies (VFA, VPb, and VI), interstitials (FAi, Pbi, and Ii), anti-site substitutions (MAI, PbI, IMA, and IPb) and so on. These charged defects not only afford additional energy levels to act as recombination centers, but also trigger the degradation of perovskite films, deteriorating the PCEs and stability of the resultant devices. Therefore, it is of great importance to effectively passivate defects for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Thus far, much effort has been dedicated to passivating defects in the perovskite, where defects are most likely to generate. Diverse organic ammonium salts or functional molecules, such as phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MP), and (5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)acetic acid (MTDAA), have been exploited to suppress defect-induced nonradiative recombination on the basis of electrostatic or chemical interactions. For example, MTDAA with multi-active-site chemically interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ at the surface or grain boundary of Rb0.02(FA0.95Cs0.05)0.98PbI2.91Br0.03Cl0.06 perovskite films to significantly increase the average charge lifetime from 468.34 to 629.62 ns and uplift the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.125 to 1.160 V. Recently, the strategy to construct a two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) heterojunction has become favourable to simultaneously passivate defects and enhance the moisture stability because of the hydrophobic characteristics of the large organic cations in the 2D layer. Leong et al. employed 5-aminovaleric acid iodide (5-AVAI) to in situ form the 2D (5-AVA)2PbI4 layer in the top 3D MAPbI3 perovskite, resulting in nearly two-fold enhancement of stability under ambient conditions compared with that of the pure 3D PSCs. Notably, the research on the 2D/3D junction in the MA-free devices has been rarely investigated (Table S1, ESI). Paetzold et al. coated n-butylammonium bromide (BABr) solution onto the Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite with a bandgap (Eg) of ∼1.72 eV to induce the formation of 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) interlayer. They observed that a fast hole extraction is achieved only if a very thin 2D perovskite was introduced with 2 mg mL−1 BABr solution. Accordingly, the non-radiative recombination within the cells was significantly suppressed, and the VOC was considerably enhanced by 80 mV. Nonetheless, the highest PCE for Cs/FA-based devices with 2D/3D heterojunction is still significantly lower than that of MA-containing PSC devices. Wang et al. designed a new molecule of cyclopropylcarbamidine hydrochloride (CPAH) to form a 2D layer for surface defect passivation. Motivated by the latest successes in the efficiency enhancement of 2D PSCs by suitable design of functional molecules, it is promising to further improve the device performance of MA-free PSCs by optimizing the 2D/3D architecture by functional molecule selection.
Toward this goal, we treated Cs/FA-based perovskite films with a novel fluorine-containing aromatic ammonium salt, 4-trifluorophenylammonium iodide (TFPAI), to introduce the 2D/3D junction. Importantly, the 2D interlayer depresses nonradiative recombination due to defect passivation, leading to improved device performance even subject to treatment with excess TFPAI solution (e.g., 13 mg mL−1 TFPAI solution). As a consequence, an impressive PCE of 22.7% is delivered for the champion TFPAI modified device with a VOC of 1.15 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 24.2 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.0%, superior to those of the control cell (PCE = 20.1%, VOC = 1.09 V, JSC = 23.9 mA cm−2, and FF = 76.7%), which is among the most efficient Cs/FA-based devices with the 2D/3D structure. Additionally, the unsealed 2D/3D devices maintain 85% and 81% of their original efficiency after exposure at RH = 35 ± 5% atmosphere environment for 60 days (1440 h) (67% for the control devices) and aging at 85 °C for 50 days (1200 h) (69% for the control devices), respectively, demonstrating considerably improved stability. This work provides a facile and effective strategy to improve the performance of MA-free PSCs by constructing a hydrophobic 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure with ideal functional molecules.


Fig. 1a schematically depicts the Cs/FA-based device with the configuration of glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(I0.95Br0.03Cl0.02)3/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au, in which the perovskite film prepared via a typical one-step antisolvent method. To form the 2D/3D junction, TFPAI was dissolved in isopropanol (IPA) at different concentrations (5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 mg mL−1, marked as TFPAI-5, 7, 9, 11, and 13, respectively) were deposited onto the as-prepared MA-free perovskite films. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of TFPAI, the control film, and the TFPAI-treated sample are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). Both films exhibit strong stretching vibration peaks of N–H (at 3397 and 3264 cm−1) and CN (at 1713 cm−1) from FA+. The peaks at 1352 and 1622 cm−1 can be assigned to C–N and N–H bending, respectively. Notably, two new peaks at 1492 and 1327 cm−1 are detectable for the TFPAI-treated sample in comparison with the control film, which are, respectively, corresponding to the vibrational modes of aromatic CC and –CF3 of TFPAI, indicative of the accommodation of TFPAI in the top perovskite film.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was employed to ascertain the effect of TFPAI on the crystalline structure of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1b, all the samples exhibit diffraction peaks at 14.5°, 20.1°, and 24.6°, which are, respectively, assigned to the (100), (110), and (111) planes of the cubic phase of the perovskite, indicating that the 3D perovskite crystal structure did not change after subjecting to the TFPAI post-treatment. Interestingly, we observed a gradual increase in the diffraction intensity of the (100) plane with the decrease of the (110) plane (Fig. S2a and Table S2, ESI). As plotted in Fig. S2b (ESI), the ratio of diffraction signals between (100) and (110) planes is increased from 1.64 (the control) to the maximum of 2.20 for the TFPAI-9 based film, implying that TFPAI treatment is favourable for the growth of (100) crystal plane of the cubic perovskite. Moreover, the peak at 12.6° related to PbI2 is detected in the control sample, whereas, it disappears upon the TFPAI treatment, suggesting the reaction happens between TFPAI and PbI2. It should be noted that three new diffraction peaks start to show up in the range of 5° to 10° when the TFPAI concentration is higher than 7 mg mL−1 (Fig. S2c, ESI), revealing that the new phase emerges on top of the perovskite film while TFPAI is absent. As reported, the peaks below 10° are commonly attributed to the formation of a 2D perovskite layer. Given that TFPAI is a bulky organic cation that commonly features the formation of 2D-RP perovskite with the structure of (TFPA)2FAn−1PbnI3n+1 (n refers to the number of the 2D layer), we prepared the 2D-RP perovskite with different n values according to the stoichiometric ratio in the structural formula to prove our speculation and measured their corresponding XRD patterns (Fig. S3, ESI). Notably, the 2D perovskite (TFPA)2PbI4 with n = 1 indeed displayed three identical peaks with the TFPAI-7 in the range of 5–10° (Fig. 1b), verifying the formation of the 2D/3D junction. As for TFPAI-5, the 2D-RP perovskite phase might be too thin to be detected with the XRD measurement due to the rather low concentration of the TFPAI solution. In a word, the 2D/3D junction is successfully induced by the TFPAI treatment.

Fig. 1c and d display the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films without and with TFPAI treatment. Both samples exhibit compact and uniform morphology with similar grain dimensions (Fig. S4, ESI). Interestingly, the 3D perovskite film treated with TFPAI showed a distinct textured surface, presumably owing to the formation of a 2D/3D junction. It should be noted that species with relatively bright contrast (ascribed to the residual PbI2) can be obviously observed in the control film. Whereas they disappear after the TFPAI treatment, consistent with the XRD results. Their corresponding cross-sectional SEM images are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI), in which both devices exhibit similar morphology except for the subtle difference in the grain size. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the films, which were modified with varying TFPAI concentrations, are displayed in Fig. S6a (ESI). No distinct changes are observable and the Eg remains to be ∼1.57 eV (Fig. S6b, ESI), confirming that the change in optical properties for the TFPAI-treated film are negligible.
The effect of the 2D/3D junction on the photovoltaic (PV) performance was comprehensively investigated and the current–density (J–V) curves are displayed in Fig. 2a. Obviously, the PCE is significantly improved upon the TFPAI treatment, and the highest one is achieved for TFPAI-9 (Table S3, ESI), indicating that the formation of a 2D/3D junction is beneficial for excellent cell performance. The statistics of PV parameters of devices coated with various TFPAI concentrations (15 for each) are also provided, as illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI). The PCEs increase with increasing TFPAI concentrations due to the dramatically enhanced VOC and FF and the optimal devices are achieved at the TFPAI concentrations of 9–11 mg ml−1. Upon further increasing the concentration of TFPAI solution (i.e., 13 mg ml−1), the PCEs of TFPAI-treated cells decrease, attributed to the decreases in JSC and FF. In a general sense, under the relatively low concentration, the incomplete surface coverage would limit the passivation effect of the 2D/3D heterostructure. On the contrary, the formation of a too-thick 2D segment might adversely deteriorate the carrier transport and increase charge recombination, thus decreasing the PCEs. Nonetheless, the resultant devices with 13 mg mL−1 TFPAI treatment still exhibit excellent passivation effect, which presents consistently higher VOC and FF than those of the pristine device. Therefore, the optimal concentration was found to be 9 mg mL−1 in the current case. For convenience, we, hereafter, refer the device modified with TFPAI-9 to the 2D/3D device, in this work. Fig. 2b and c show the J–V curves of the best-performing cells under both the reverse and forward scan directions. The control device exhibits a PCE of 20.1%, together with the VOC of 1.09 V, JSC of 23.9 mA cm−2, and FF of 76.7%. In contrast, the 2D/3D device gives a considerably-improved PCE of 22.7% (VOC = 1.15 V, FF = 82.0%, JSC = 24.2 mA cm−2), which is among the most efficient 2D/3D structure cells with Cs/FA-based perovskite. In addition, the 2D/3D device exhibits a much smaller hysteresis index of 0.044, defined as (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse, than that of the control one with 0.085, implying that the 2D layer atop the 3D perovskite can effectively passivate interfacial defects and suppress ion migration. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured with the integrated JSC of 23.2 mA cm−2 for the control and 23.4 mA cm−2 for the 2D/3D device, which well-matched with those from the J–V measurement (Fig. S8, ESI). Fig. 2d shows the steady-state power output of the control and 2D/3D device measured at the maximum power point under 1 sun illumination conditions, from which a stabilized efficiency of 19.2% and 21.9% are determined for the control and 2D/3D device, respectively, consistent with those from the J–V results. Noteworthily, a much stable output was observed for the 2D/3D device, illustrating that the charge extraction is faster and the charge accumulation is suppressed effectively within the 2D/3D device. The statistical distribution of PV parameters for a batch of cells (30 for each) are shown in Fig. 2e and f and S9 (ESI). As listed in Table S4 (ESI), the 2D/3D devices exhibit remarkably enlarged average PCE of 22.1 ± 0.7% than that of the control one (19.6 ± 1.1%) due to the improvement in the VOC and FF, further proving the reliability of J–V measurement. What is more, a narrower distribution in all PV parameters can be clearly observed for the 2D/3D devices in comparison with that of the control cells, strongly verifying the effectiveness of the 2D/3D junction for highly efficient MA-free PSCs.
To uncover the PCE enhancement induced by the 2D/3D junction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was first performed to understand the interaction between the TFPAI and perovskite film. The survey spectra are displayed in Fig. S10 (ESI), in which, a new peak assigned to F 1s appears at 687.6 eV for the 2D/3D junction when compared with the control sample (Fig. S11a, ESI), affirming the presence of TFPAI in the 2D/3D junction. Both samples show that the C–C and C–N signals are located at 284.8 and 285.6 eV, respectively (Fig. 3a), which are ascribed to either FA+ or TFPA+ cations in them. The intensity of the C–N signal is significantly increased for the TFPAI-treated sample, further suggesting the formation of a 2D layer onto the 3D perovskite. The signal of the π–π bond (292.1 eV) is obviously detected in the 2D/3D junction, ascribed to the benzene ring in the TFPAI molecule. Noteworthily, the signal corresponding to the CO bond (288.1 eV) is probed in the control film, which might be associated with the reaction between the film and oxygen or water. On the contrary, the 2D/3D film shows a distinctly reduced CO intensity, illustrating that the 2D/3D junction could protect 3D perovskite from the erosion of oxygen and water. As previously reported, the –NH3+ group in 2D perovskite spacer cations could passivate anionic defects by suppressing the formation of iodine vacancy VI through ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding. Besides, the additional free iodine ions of ammonium iodide salts will also compensate VI. The positively charged under-coordinated Pb2+ ions, which are exposed on the surface of perovskite and can be attributed to the formation of VI, would be reduced with the compensation of VI. The signals of I 3d and Pb 4f are shifted towards lower binding energy after the TFPAI treatment (Fig. 3b and S11b, ESI), suggestive of changes in the chemical environment of Pb and I, manifesting the interaction between 3D perovskite and the 2D capping layer. In addition, the Pb:I ratio of the device before and after the TFPAI treatment were calculated using the element sensitivity factor method based on the Pb and I element spectral data in XPS, as displayed in Table S5. The Pb:I ratio for the control film is 1:1.88, which is well below the value of 1:2.85 used in perovskite precursor, and illuminates abundant VI generated for the control perovskite film after annealing. In a stark contrast, the 2D/3D junction demonstrates a substantially increased Pb:I ratio of 1:2.58, signifying the excellent VI healing effect subjected to the TFPAI treatment. We hence conclude that the TFPAI treatment poses an effective influence on defect passivation.
Steady photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were measured to elucidate the effect of the 2D/3D junction on carrier dynamics. Only one PL emission peak was observed as shown in Fig. 3c, and the 2D/3D film shows a slightly blue-shifted emission with almost three times higher intensity than that of the control film, which might be attributed to effectively passivated defects by the 2D/3D junction. The TRPL spectra in Fig. 3d are fitted using a biexponential decay function according to the equation of Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + γ0, where τ1 and τ2, respectively, reflect the lifetimes for fast (trap-assisted nonradiative recombination) and slow (radiative recombination) decay, while A1 and A2 represent their corresponding relative amplitudes. The average carrier lifetime (τave) can be estimated by the equation of τave = ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτi. The detailed fitting information is listed in Table S6 (ESI). It is worth noting that the 2D/3D film exhibited a substantially prolonged τave of 378.09 ns compared to that of the control film (91.44 ns), validating the depressed nonradiative recombination, in good accordance with the PL results, thus the improved VOC and PCE are expectable for the 2D/3D junction-based devices.
To quantitively evaluate the defect density in the perovskite films, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analysis was performed with both the electron-only (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PC61BM/Au) and hole-only (FTO/PTAA/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) devices. The SCLC curves consist of the ohmic contact region (n = 1), Child's law region (n = 2), and trap-filled limit region (n > 3), as shown in Fig. 3e and f. The trap density (Nt) can be calculated from the equation Nt = (2ε0εrVTFL)/(qL2), where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant for the perovskite (46.9),VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region (determined by the intersection of n = 1 and n > 3 regions),q is the elemental charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), and L is the thickness of the perovskite film (∼550 nm). Table 1 shows that the Nt,e and Nt,h of the 2D/3D film are 0.22 × 1016 and 1.34 × 1016 cm−3, respectively, which are smaller than those of the control film (Nt,e = 1.18 × 1016 cm−3 and Nt,h = 2.40 × 1016 cm−3). The lower defect density in the 2D/3D cells straightforwardly consolidates that the 2D/3D junction effectively passivate defects in the perovskite films, resulting in suppressed trap-assisted nonradiative recombination and enhanced VOC. Furthermore, the charge mobility (μ) can be estimated from the n = 2 region in Fig. 3e and f with the Mott–Gurney equation of JD = (9μεrε0Vb2/8L3). From the J1/2/V vs. voltage in Fig. S12 (ESI), μe and μh of the control film are, respectively, determined to be 4.05 × 10−3 and 1.28 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1, while the 2D/3D film shows a promoted mobility with μe of 5.74 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1 and μh of 6.93 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1. The increase in mobility might be ascribed to lowered trap densities. In addition, the 2D/3D junction sample exhibits a more balanced carrier transport with μe/μh ≈ 1 than the control sample (μe/μh ≈ 3), well-explained the higher FF and smaller HI in the 2D/3D junction device. Overall, the passivation mechanism of TFPAI treatment is schematically displayed in Fig. 3g. The TFPAI molecules play two roles in the absorber layer: (i) passivating defects in the top light absorber layer to suppress the non-radiative recombination, (ii) forming a 2D shield to prevent the 3D perovskite film from the penetration of oxygen/moisture in the atmosphere.

We then recorded the light intensity dependence of J–V characteristics to probe the charge recombination mechanisms within devices. Fig. S13 (ESI) shows that the JSC follows a power-law dependence on light intensity (J ∝ Plightα) in a double logarithmic scale. The fitted α values for both the control (α = 0.982) and 2D/3D devices (α = 0.986) are close to unity, indicative of negligible bimolecular recombination and no space charge effects for both devices.Fig. 4a shows linear characteristic of the relationship of VOCversus the logarithm of light intensity, from which the ideality factor (n) can be estimated by the equation of n = (q/kT)·(dVOC/dln(I)), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and I represents light intensity. If n is equal to 1, the bimolecular recombination dominates in the device. When n is approaching 2, trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is dominant. The 2D/3D device shows a significantly lower slope (n = 1.48) than the control device (n = 1.74), verifying the depressed trap-induced recombination, which is in line with the TRPL and SCLC results and contributes to the notable enhancement in VOC. Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis was further performed to understand the enlarged VOC. The capacitance–voltage (C−2–V) plots in Fig. 4b display that both curves exhibit negative slopes, indicative of p-type properties. The built-in potential (Vbi) can be obtained using the eqn 1/C2 = 2(Vbi − V)/(Aeεε0NA), where A is the area of the device and NA reflects the doping concentration of the device. Consequently, the Vbi value can be extracted from the x-intercept of the linear region (marked in green), which is determined to be 0.84 and 0.93 V for the control and 2D/3D junction-based device, respectively. It is reported that Vbi not only serves as the driving force for photo-generated carrier separation and collection but also dominates the VOC performance. Therefore, the larger Vbi in the 2D/3D device results in improved FF and VOC.
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were employed to investigate the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and charge transport kinetics within the devices. Fig. 4c and d present the Nyquist plots measured at varying voltages (from 0 to 0.6 V) for the control and 2D/3D junction devices under dark conditions, respectively, which are fitted by an equivalent circuit model in Fig. S14a (ESI). Specifically, the incomplete semicircles at low frequency are attributed to the charge recombination process (Rrec), while the arcs in the high-frequency range mainly represent the charge transport features in bulk layers (Rtr). The fitting parameters for the control and 2D/3D devices are listed in Tables S7 and S8 (ESI), respectively. We also compared the dependence of Rtr and Rrec on the applied voltage, as plotted in Fig. S14b and c (ESI), respectively. Obviously, the 2D/3D device displays a lower Rtr and higher Rrec in comparison with the control device under the same voltage. Specifically, under the bias voltage of 0.6 V, the Rtr of 2D/3D device is 6.98 × 104 Ω, which is lower than that of the control device (2.37 × 105 Ω), and the Rrec of 2D/3D device (2.69 × 106 Ω) is higher than that of the control (2.10 × 106 Ω), indicating the smoother charge transfer and depressed recombination of the 2D/3D sample than those of the control device.
Finally, we comparatively investigated the impact of the 2D/3D junction on the device's stability. It has been widely recognized that the formation of a 2D/3D junction can improve the moisture stability of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the TFPAI incorporated perovskite films exhibit a much larger contact angle of 71° than the control film (56°), revealing more hydrophobic property. The enlarged water contact angle might be related to the 2D capping layer with hydrophobic groups (benzene ring and –CF3 group), which protect the perovskite film from oxygen/moisture invasion (Fig. 3g).Fig. 5c displays the changes for both samples subjected to high humidity environment (with relative humidity, RH = 70–80%), and the UV-vis spectra are correspondingly recorded in Fig. S15 (ESI). After 16 hours, the optical colour change of the control film can be clearly observed accompanied by a decrease in UV absorption intensity, and the perovskite film drastically degrades from black to yellow within 48 h. In stark contrast, the 2D/3D junction film stored under the same condition shows no significant changes in colour or in UV-vis absorption spectra, which indicates that the 2D/3D film treated with TFPAI has excellent moisture stability, consistent with the effect of the 2D layer as illustrated in the enlarged water contact angle test and lowered CO bond intensity in XPS. On the other hand, the residual PbI2 can be consumed in the 2D/3D film, avoiding the degradation of the polycrystalline film caused by them. We also monitored the device stability aged at RH = 35 ± 5% in the air environment. Fig. 5d and S16 (ESI) display the evolution of the photovoltaic parameters. Over 85% of its original PCE is retained for the 2D/3D device after moisture intrusion for 60 days (1440 h), whereas the PCE of the control device decays to 67% of its original value. The digital images for aged devices from both the light incidence side and back side are, respectively, shown in the inset of Fig. 5d and S17 (ESI). Black photoactive phases are still retained in 2D/3D devices, further demonstrating the improved moisture stability of the 2D/3D junction, consistent with the previous reports. In addition, MA-free perovskite films usually exhibit excellent thermal stability, we concurrently investigated the stability of the 2D/3D junction incorporated devices when subject to 85 °C in a N2-filled glovebox for 50 days (1200 h). As shown in Fig. 5e, approximately 81% and 69% of the initial PCEs are, respectively, retained for the 2D/3D and control devices. The improvement in thermal stability in the 2D/3D device could be attributed to the reduced defect density and impeded ion diffusion. To sum up, the introduction of the 2D/3D junction considerably boosts the humidity and thermal stability of MA-free PSCs.

In summary, we introduced a functional molecule, TFPAI, into perovskite to form a 2D/3D heterojunction that effectively decreases defect concentrations and enables balanced carrier mobility. By coating the MA-free perovskite film with an aromatic ammonium salt, TFPAI, a 2D-RP interlayer of (TFPA)2PbI4 is formed to effectively suppress non-radiative recombination. Owing to these advantages, the champion device with the 2D/3D junction delivers a considerable PCE of 22.7% with a VOC of 1.15 V, a JSC of 24.2 mA cm−2, and an FF of 82.0%, distinctly higher than that of the control film (PCE = 20.1%, VOC = 1.09 V, JSC = 23.9 mA cm−2, and FF = 76.7%). What is more, the 2D/3D junction significantly enhances the moisture stability and thermal stability, and approximately 85% and 81% of the initial PCEs can be preserved when exposed at RH = 35 ± 5% atmosphere environment for 60 days and subjected to 85 °C for 50 days, respectively. This study provides an avenue of passivating agent design for high-performing PSCs towards their practical applications.
