In this work, we report the synthesis of mesoporous Bi2S3 nanorods under hydrothermal conditions without additives, and investigated their catalytic activities as the CE in DSCs by I–V curves and tested conversion efficiency. To further improve their power conversion efficiency, we added different amounts of reduced graphene by simple physical mixing. With the addition of 9 wt% reduced graphene (rGO), the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage and fill factor were Jsc = 15.33 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.74 V and FF = 0.609. More importantly, the conversion efficiency reached 6.91%, which is slightly inferior to the commercial Pt counter electrode (7.44%). Compared to the conventional Pt counter electrodes of solar cells, this new material has the advantages of low-cost, facile synthesis and high efficiency with graphene assistance. To the best of our knowledge, this Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO system has the best performance ever recorded in all Bi2S3-based CEs in the DSCs system.

Over the past two decades, considerable scientific and industrial attention has been focused on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) because of the simple fabrication procedures, environmental friendliness, transparency, and good plasticity. The counter electrode (CE) is a crucial component of DSCs. Pt deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass is a conventional and effective CE with good electrocatalytic properties for the reduction of triiodide to iodide. However, because of its limited availability and high cost, finding alternatives for Pt in the DSCs system is crucial. In recent studies, some inorganic materials have shown excellent electrocatalytic activity in reducing triiodide, which will possess an important candidacy as a promising alternative CE materials in DSCs. In particular, carbon materials have been tested as CEs because of their low cost and excellent corrosion resistance against the redox couple.

Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), as an important V–VI semiconductor material, exhibits a lamellar binary structure and crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (Pbnm space group). Recent studies of Bi2S3 revealed that they have significant potential in memristors, electrochemical devices and optoelectronics. In particular, Bi2S3 shows a superior effect in DSCs as a CE material, owing to its low direct band gap of 1.2–1.7 eV, an absorption coefficient in the order of 104–105 cm−1 and an incident photon to electron conversion efficiency of ∼5%. Previously, our group compared the catalytic activities of different facets within Bi2S3via density functional theory (DFT) computations. We determined that the (130) facet has the largest surface energy, the best electrical conductivity and the highest position of the conduction band minimum, suggesting the highest catalytic activities of Bi2S3 with the (130) facet and the most effective electron transfer from the CE to triiodide. This was verified by experiments and the DSCs with (130)-facet Bi2S3 CE exhibited a conversion efficiency of 3.5%, which is significantly higher than other Bi2S3 CEs, such as (221)-faceted (1.9%). This shows that although Bi2S3 has these advantageous characteristics, the result of the practical application in DSCs is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is essential to find a method to improve the performance of Bi2S3 in DSCs.
For a long time, the combination of nanomaterials with graphene has been considered an effective way of improving electrochemical stability and conductivity. This is because graphene has various attractive properties, such as high electrical conductivity, high Fermi velocity, linear energy dispersion relation and structural flexibility, which makes it an ideal auxiliary for mixing or anchoring insulating materials. Inspired by these features, Bi2S3-graphene composites have been naturally explored and exhibit superior electrochemical performance for DSCs. Quite recently, Chen's group synthesized 3D Bi2S3 microspheres comprised of nanorods on graphene, and investigated their conversion efficiency as the CE in DSCs (5.5%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported performance among all Bi2S3-based CEs. As graphene as a substrate for Bi2S3 has shown success in DSCs, what will happen when two types of materials are combined by simple physical mixing? It will be very interesting to explore Bi2S3 with graphene as a safe CE for high conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells.
Herein, we report the synthesis of mesoporous Bi2S3 nanorods under hydrothermal conditions without additives. The reaction parameters were optimized. In the present work, we first investigated the photovoltaic properties of Bi2S3 products mixed with different amounts of graphene. The results show that mesoporous Bi2S3 nanorods with the appropriate amount of graphene can be a low-cost substitute for Pt CEs.

All the reagents were of analytic grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis procedure, 1 g Bi(NO3)3 was placed into 25 mL of deionized water with stirring to form a homogenous solution. Subsequently, 0.8 g thioacetamide was added with stirring. A brown colloid suspension was instantly formed. And then, the precursor mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 120 °C for 24 h. After the sample was gradually cooled to room temperature, a black precipitate was collected and washed with distilled water, and then with absolute ethanol, and the sample was placed in absolute ethanol.


All the reagents were of analytic grade and used without further purification. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were prepared by a modified Hummers method. In detail, graphite powder (2.0 g) was dispersed into 100 ml cooled (0 °C) H2SO4 (98%), followed by the slow addition of KMnO4 (6.0 g). Then, the suspension was stirred at 35 °C for 3 days. Subsequently, 200 ml distilled water was added and maintained at 98 °C for 2 h. When cooled to 60 °C, 10 ml H2O2 (30%) was injected into the suspension to completely react with the excess KMnO4, and a bright yellow mixture was obtained. The suspension was centrifuged and washed with HCl (30%) and distilled water until the pH was ∼7. The precipitate was collected and stored for further use.


X-ray diffraction analysis of the samples was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaka D/max2500) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphology of the as-prepared products was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova Nano SEM 230, FEI.) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2F20, FEI). The elemental composition was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) of the sample was analyzed by nitrogen adsorption in a Tristar 3000 nitrogen adsorption apparatus, and AFM (Multimode8, Bruker). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was implemented on an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany) with a three-electrode system (the prepared CEs as the working electrode, a symmetrical platinum sheets as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode as the pesudo reference electrode) in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV S−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on dummy cells with a typical symmetric sandwich-like structure, i.e., CE/electrolyte/CE, using an impedance measurement unit of the workstation in the frequency range, 0.1–106 Hz, with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements were carried out on a Keithley 2410 digital source meter under AM 1.5 illumination (continuous solar simulator for PV cells, 100 mW cm−2), which was previously calibrated by a Si reference cell. All the measurements were recorded at room temperature. The UV spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 spectrometer at room temperature.


Approximately 0.05 g of Bi2S3 powder was mixed with 0.5 mL of a 2.5% PEG20000 solution and stirred until a fluid mixture formed. Then, a film was prepared using the doctor-blade method on FTO conductive glass (LOF, TEC-15, 15Wper square). The film was heated at 450 °C for 1 h under the protection of argon to obtain the Bi2S3 counter electrode. A commercial TiO2 sol (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was used to prepare the TiO2 film on FTO also through the doctor-blade method, and the film was soaked in an N-719 dye solution (in ethanol) for 24 h to obtain the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. The DSCs were assembled by injecting the electrolyte into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode. The liquid electrolyte composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine with acetonitrile as the solvent. Surlyn 1702 was used as the spacer between the two electrodes. The two electrodes were clipped together and solid paraffin was used as the sealant to prevent the leaking of the electrolyte solution. The effective cell area was 0.25 cm2.


The phase and structures of the as-synthesized samples were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized Bi2S3. XRD confirmed the presence of orthorhombic Bi2S3 in the space group Pbnm (a = 11.15 Å, b = 11.30 Å, c = 3.98 Å, JCPDS: 17-0320), and the intense and sharp peaks indicated that the product was highly crystalline. From Fig. 1, it can also be seen that the (211) plane was unusually stronger than the corresponding conventional values. This suggests that the resulting Bi2S3 products were mainly dominated by the (211) plane. Therefore, the (211) plane was preferentially oriented parallel to the surface of the supporting substrate in the experiment. Further evidence for the composition was obtained by EDS. Fig. S1 shows the typical EDS spectra of the as-synthesized Bi2S3 sample. The Bi to S ratio was approximately 1:1.53, which shows that the sample has high purity.

The morphology of the as-synthesized Bi2S3 was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2a and 2b, the typical morphology of the as-prepared Bi2S3 is a nanorod structure with lengths ranging from 50 to 90 nm. Fig. 2c and 2e shows typical TEM images of several Bi2S3 nanorods. Similar to the SEM images, these nanorods have lengths below 100 nm. The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2d) shows that the crystalline lattice distances in the white frame are 3.12 Å and 2.81 Å, corresponding to the (211) and (221) planes of orthorhombic Bi2S3, respectively, which are consistent with the XRD results. Regarding the porosity, the N2 physisorption isotherms for Bi2S3 nanorods were the characteristic of a typical type III isotherm based on Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller (BDDT) classification (Fig. 3). The BET surface area reached 11.80 m2 g−1, and the average pore size was calculated to be ∼25 nm, which is the characteristic isotherm of mesoporous materials. The mesoporous structure can be clearly observed in the higher magnification images in Fig. 2f.
The relationship between the morphology of the mesoporous Bi2S3 nanorods and synthesis time was investigated. Time-dependent experiments were conducted with different synthetic times from 1 to 24 h. The XRD patterns in Fig. 4d clearly showed that the Bi2S3 phase was formed relatively faster after reacting for just 1 h. On the other hand, no regular morphology was observed at the initial stages (Fig. 4a). At 2 h, the particle sizes varied around tens of nanometers and agglomeration was observed (Fig. 4b). As the reaction time increased to 8 h, large numbers of nanorods were produced, but some nanosheets and irregular shape products were observed (Fig. 4c). As the reaction proceeded to 24 h, regular and uniform nanorods were formed (Fig. 2a). The results showed that the reaction time is one of the main factors in forming nanorod Bi2S3.
The samples were tested as the counter electrode materials in dye-sensitized solar cells. When the as-prepared Bi2S3/FTO film was used as a CE, the photovoltaic characteristics were Voc = 0.696 V, Jsc = 15.34 mA cm−2, FF = 0.447, and η = 4.78% (its SEM image, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI after calcination at 450 °C, respectively). The as-prepared Bi2S3 exhibited high power conversion efficiency. This was attributed to their mesoporous structural features. Fig. S3 shows that the as-prepared Bi2S3 still possess a mesoporous structure after calcination at 450 °C. The mesoporous structure causes the light waves to penetrate deep inside the catalyst and results in a high charge mobility, which is obviously beneficial for enhancing the catalytic activity and power conversion efficiency.
As mentioned above, because graphene has some specific properties, such as high electrical conductivity, we tried to mix a small amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to enhance the power conversion efficiency (AFM images and XRD pattern of rGO shown in Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI, respectively). Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent–voltage curves of five DSCs using the as-prepared Bi2S3, Bi2S3 + 3 wt% rGO, Bi2S3 + 6 wt% rGO, Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO, Bi2S3 + 12 wt% rGO, Bi2S3 + 15 wt% rGO and Pt electrodes as CEs. As expected, with the addition of 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 wt% rGO, the CE performance was substantially improved. In particular, the devices equipped with Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO CE yielded energy conversion efficiencies (η) of 6.91%, which is slightly inferior to the Pt CE (7.44%). Therefore, the high catalytic activity of Bi2S3 with graphene assist is validated. The photovoltaic and electrochemical performance parameters for different CEs are summarized in Table 1.

Owing to the added carbon materials, the Bi2S3 catalytic properties were improved, possibly due to the enhanced triiodide reduction or better contact between the electrolyte and the Bi2S3 catalyst as CoS. To clearly evaluate the electrochemical catalytic activities of the six Bi2S3-based CEs to reduce triiodide, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system at a scan rate of 50 mv s−1. For comparison, we also measured the cyclic voltammograms of the Pt electrode under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, two typical pairs of reversible redox peaks were observed for both Pt electrodes. The pair of peaks at a low potential were attributed to the redox reaction of eqn (1), whereas the pair at high potential were assigned to the redox reaction of eqn (2).

The CV curves of iodide/triiodide redox species using six types of Bi2S3-based materials are shown in Fig. 7, Bi2S3 and Bi2S3 + 15 wt% rGO electrodes exhibited one pair of redox peaks assigned to reaction eqn (1). Compared to the other five Bi2S3-based electrodes, the profile and peak location of the CV for the Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO electrode was closer to that of Pt, demonstrating similar electrochemical catalytic activity. In addition, both Bi2S3 + 6 wt% rGO and Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO electrodes exhibited a large current density, indicating a faster charge transfer process, which lead to a high electrochemical catalytic activity.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to examine the charge transfer process and the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Fig. 8a presents the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells using various CEs, where two semicircles were observed among all Bi2S3-based CEs. The high-frequency (∼100 MHz) intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The semicircle maxima in the middle-frequency region represent the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the capacitance corresponds to the constant phase angle element (CPE) at the CE/electrolyte interface, whereas those in the low-frequency region provide information on the resistance at the finite layer Nernst diffusion impedance within the electrolyte. Fig. 8b shows that the equivalent circuit consists of several components. Herein, the Rct value was calculated by fitting the left-hand hump, and it inversely varied with the electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide, which is the key step of the catalytic process. In Table 1, Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO CE showed a larger Rct (4.98 Ω) compared with the other five Bi2S3-based CEs, which demonstrates the excellent catalytic activity of Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO CE, and explains why the energy conversion efficiency of Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO CE was slightly inferior to the Pt CE (1.70 Ω). Wo is the Warburg impedance, which arises from mass-transport limitations due to the diffusion of the triiodide/iodide couple within the electrolyte. In addition, the Wo values of all Bi2S3-based CEs were considerably larger than that of Pt CE, illustrating the large diffusion impedance. In addition, larger Wo and Rs values leads to a relatively lower fill factor (FF). Overall, the EIS results agree with the photocurrent–voltage experiments.
Tafel-polarization measurements were conducted with the dummy cells used in the EIS experiments. Fig. 9 shows the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of the voltage (U) for the oxidation/reduction of triiodide to iodide. According to the literature, at a low sweep rate, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) depends on the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide species in the electrolyte. Herein, it was found that except for the pure Bi2S3 electrode, the Jlim values of the other six electrodes had an analogous magnitude according to eqn (3). This suggests that there is a slight difference in the diffusion coefficients among these electrodes. In eqn (3), D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the spacer thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, F is the Faraday constant ,and C is the triiodide concentration.

In addition, the slopes of the anodic and cathodic branches were in the order of Pt > Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO > Bi2S3 + 12 wt% rGO > Bi2S3 + 6 wt% rGO > Bi2S3 + 15 wt% rGO > Bi2S3 + 3 wt% rGO > Bi2S3. The exchange current density (J0) of the Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO was slightly inferior to that of Pt, demonstrating that Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO had relatively lower catalytic activity than Pt. These results are in good agreement with the EIS parameters in terms of eqn (4), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, Rct is extracted from the electrochemical impendence spectra, n is the total number of samples, and F is the Faraday constant.

The EIS and Tafel-polarization measurements showed that rGO plays the role of a binder and improves the bonding of some particles that replace Pt as the counter electrodes in the FTO glass substrate. The theoretical surface area of graphene is 2600 m2 g−1. Such a high surface area leads to the easy capture of electrons from the redox couples (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte; hence, the redox couples are easily reduced. This process will benefit electron transmission across the CE/substrate interface. On the other hand, the high surface area of rGO is beneficial for the enhancement of visible light absorption. Fig. 10 shows the optical property of the six Bi2S3-based materials, the absorption increased with increase in the rGO content. The introduction of rGO in the system was limited to the surface of the Bi2S3 structures. The electrons generated near an electrode surface have a higher potential for electron loss by recombination due to the longer transport time prior to collection at the FTO substrate. Therefore, this surface limited mixing can improve the overall electron transport in an effective manner and enhance the energy conversion efficiency. As shown in Table 1, the energy conversion efficiency increased with increasing rGO content. However, excessive addition of rGO decreased the energy conversion efficiency. This was attributed to the amount of light absorption by the rGO decreasing the light absorption by dye molecules, which impairs the light harvesting efficiency, decreasing the light reflected from the CE to the photoanode. Therefore, a suitable rGO content will ensure high energy conversion efficiency.
Compared to the reported 3D Bi2S3 microspheres comprised of nanorods on graphene, mesoporous Bi2S3 nanorods containing graphene exhibit considerably higher photoelectric conversion efficiency. Considering the high performance and more concise synthesis process of Bi2S3 + 9 wt% rGO CE, Bi2S3 nanorods with the appropriate amount of graphene are expected to have high potential in replacing the expensive Pt in DSCs as a promising low-cost and effective CE catalyst. In recent years, many chemists have made great contributions to the photoanode in DSCs, and a large number of excellent performance photoanode materials have been reported. For us, we are always committed to the study of CE materials, and will attempt to improve the fabrication process to achieve higher performance DSCs based on Bi2S3 in the future.

In summary, we successfully synthesized mesoporous Bi2S3 nanorods through a facile strategy. These Bi2S3 products have potential applications for DSCs, and can be an efficient alternative to Pt. With the simple physical mixture of reduced graphene oxides, Bi2S3-based CEs exhibited excellent electrochemical catalytic activity for catalyzing the reduction of triiodide. This is the first study of the photovoltaic properties of Bi2S3 nanorods mixed with different amounts of graphene. This method is robust, low-cost, simple, and efficient. This series of mesoporous Bi2S3 nanorods mixed with graphene are expected to find other applications, such as optoelectrical devices and photocatalysis.
