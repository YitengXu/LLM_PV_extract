A star-shaped oligothiophene based on triphenylamine as a core and 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate as end groups (S(TPA-3T-CA)) was synthesized. S(TPA-3T-CA) exhibited strong absorption and high hole mobility. Solution-processed solar cells based on S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM showed a power conversion efficiency of 3.60% and a fill factor of 0.56.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising cost-effective alternative for utility of solar energy, and possess light-weight, low-cost, and flexibility advantages. Much of the focus has been on the development of polymer-based OSCs which have seen a dramatic rise in efficiency over the last decade, and the encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 8% has been achieved from bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs based on polymer donors and fullerene acceptors. Compared to their polymer counterparts, small molecules offer potential advantages in terms of defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, easy purification, easy mass-scale production, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. Recently, great efforts have been dedicated to develop small molecules for application in solar cells, and so far the highest PCEs of solution-processed or vacuum-deposited OSCs based on small molecular donors and fullerene acceptors have been up to 6–7%. Despite the fact that considerable progress has been made in small molecule-based OSCs, the relatively low PCE is a hindrance to commercialization of these devices.

Triphenylamine (TPA) has special propeller starburst molecular structure due to the sp3 hybrid orbital of the nitrogen atom. As a result, amorphous materials with isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties could be expected when combining TPA with linear π-conjugated systems. Recently, star-shaped molecules with TPA as a core have shown promising performance in OSCs as donors or acceptors. In the field of designing star-shaped TPA hybrid oligothiophenes for OSCs, Roncali has done systematic research. Early in 2006, a star-shaped molecule (tris[4-(5′′-hexyl-5-terthienyl)phenyl]amine, S(TPA-HTT)) with TPA as a core and terthiophene as arms was reported. Since narrow absorption of S(TPA-HTT) leads to limited photovoltaic performance, electron-withdrawing dicyanovinyl (DCV) end groups were introduced to broaden optical absorption as a result of intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT). However, the solution processability of the molecules with DCV groups was usually insufficient to allow the fabrication of solution-processed BHJ OSCs. To solve this problem, Roncali et al. designed unsymmetrical star-shaped TPA-DCV based molecules with one or two oligothiophene branches end-capped with alkyl chains; Li et al. introduced alkyl side chains into thiophene bridges of symmetrical TPA-DCV based molecules. These solution-processed TPA-DCV molecules exhibited good performance (PCE up to 3%) in BHJ OSCs. However, tedious and time-consuming multi-step reactions were involved in introducing electron-withdrawing groups and alkyl chains. Alkyl cyanoacetate (CA) is a kind of electron withdrawing group with both cyano moiety and alkyl chain which can simultaneously induce ICT and improve solubility. As a result, alkyl CA end groups have been used in linear oligothiophenes for OSCs, and a PCE as high as 5.8% has been achieved.
Here we design and synthesize a star-shaped, donor–acceptor molecule (S(TPA-3T-CA)) with TPA as a core, oligothiophene as arms, and alkyl CA as acceptor end groups. S(TPA-3T-CA) shows excellent solution processability and thermal stability, broad and strong absorption, appropriate energy levels and high hole mobility. Solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM without any post-treatments exhibit PCEs as high as 3.60% with relatively high fill factor (FF) up to 0.56.
S(TPA-3T-CA) was synthesized by simple and facile reactions (Scheme 1). The intermediate compound S(TPA-3T-CHO) was synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction between tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)amine and 5′′-bromo-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-5-carboxaldehyde using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. A straightforward reaction of S(TPA-3T-CHO) with 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate afforded S(TPA-3T-CA). Compound S(TPA-3T-CA) was fully characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis (Fig. S1–S3, ESI). S(TPA-3T-CA) is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform at room temperature, owing to three solubilizing 2-ethylhexyl substituents. The thermal properties of S(TPA-3T-CA) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This star-shaped molecule exhibits good thermal stability with decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) at 350 °C in nitrogen (Fig. S4, ESI). The DSC traces show no melting peak, suggesting that it could be amorphous.

Fig. 1a shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of S(TPA-3T-CA) in dilute dichloromethane solution (10−6 M) and in thin solid film. S(TPA-3T-CA) in solution exhibits strong absorption; the extinction coefficient is as large as 7.3 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1 (at 494 nm). The absorption maximum of 494 nm is red-shifted by 65 nm relative to that of S(TPA-HTT) which has a similar skeleton structure without the CA acceptor unit. The significant red-shift of the absorption is due to the ICT in S(TPA-3T-CA). The thin film of S(TPA-3T-CA) shows intense absorption throughout the visible region (300–700 nm). The absorption peak of the S(TPA-3T-CA) thin film is red-shifted by 10 nm relative to that in solution, indicating that self-organization behaviour exists somewhat in the film. The optical band gap estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film is 1.95 eV, similar to that of the widely used electron donor regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).
The electrochemical property of S(TPA-3T-CA) was investigated by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method with film on a glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M [nBu4N]+[PF6]− CH3CN solution at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 1b, S(TPA-3T-CA) exhibits irreversible reduction wave with one peak at −1.10 V vs. Ag and quasi-reversible oxidation wave with peaks at 1.16 and 1.43 V vs. Ag. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials vs. FeCp2+/0 are 0.48 and −1.37 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.28 and −3.43 eV from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV under vacuum. The LUMO level of S(TPA-3T-CA) is higher than that (−3.9 eV) of PC71BM; the LUMO gap between the donor and acceptor is large enough to guarantee photoinduced electron transfer between them. The difference between the HOMO of S(TPA-3T-CA) and the LUMO of PC71BM is as large as 1.4 eV, which could lead to high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells.
The hole mobility of pristine S(TPA-3T-CA) was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/S(TPA-3T-CA)/Au (Fig. S5, ESI). A relatively high hole mobility of 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained from the pristine S(TPA-3T-CA) film. This high mobility may be related to the presence of the oligothiophene branches as already noticed in S(TPA-HTT), which exhibited hole mobility up to 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1.
To demonstrate potential application of S(TPA-3T-CA) in OSCs, we used S(TPA-3T-CA) as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor, and fabricated BHJ OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM/Ca/Al. Table 1 summarizes VOC, short circuit current density (JSC), FF, and PCE of the devices at different donor/acceptor weight ratios (Fig. 2a and Fig. S6 (ESI)). These devices yield relatively high VOC as we expected, and the VOC values (0.87–0.88 V) are almost insensitive to the donor/acceptor weight ratio. The BHJ blend at a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:2 gives the best performance: VOC, JSC, FF and PCE reaches 0.88 V, 7.30 mA cm−2, 0.56 and 3.60%, respectively (Fig. 2a). The FF of 0.56 is the highest value reported for TPA derivatives or star-shaped donor-based OSCs, suggesting efficient charge extraction. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) of the blend film with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:2 is shown in Fig. 2b. This blend film shows broad IPCE spectra from 300 to 700 nm with a maximum of 52% at 505 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of the blend. From IPCE spectra, the calculated photocurrent density is 7.06 mA cm−2, 3% mismatch with that obtained from J–V measurement.

The morphological requirement for the active layer in high performance OSCs is nanoscale phase separation, which enables a large interface area for exciton dissociation and, in the mean time, a continuous percolating path for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes. The active layer morphology was examined by an atomic force microscope (AFM) technique in tapping mode. The AFM height and phase images of the blend film of S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) without any post-treatments are shown in Fig. 3. The film exhibits a good interpenetrating network and has a relatively smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.55 nm. The domain sizes estimated by cross-section profiles are about 30–40 nm, which approach exciton diffusion length in organic materials. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the internal structure of the active layer. The TEM image (Fig. S7, ESI) of the S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend film is consistent with AFM results. This nanoscale interpenetrating network with a smooth surface is beneficial to the exciton dissociation, charge transport and in turn enhanced efficiency of the OSC.
In summary, a star-shaped donor–acceptor molecule (S(TPA-3T-CA)) with TPA as a core, oligothiophene as arms and 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate as acceptor end groups was synthesized. S(TPA-3T-CA) has excellent solution processability and thermal stability, broad and strong absorption, appropriate energy levels matched with PC71BM and high hole mobility. The film of S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend exhibits a good interpenetrating network with a relatively smooth surface. The BHJ OSCs based on S(TPA-3T-CA):PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend without any post-treatment afford a PCE of 3.60% and a FF of 0.56. This preliminary work demonstrates that multi-dimensional oligothiophenes end-capped with alkyl cyanoacetate groups may be promising donors for solution-processed OSCs.
