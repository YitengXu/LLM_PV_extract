In this study, highly efficient dye-sensitized indoor photovoltaics (DSiPVs) are fabricated using quasi-solid-state cobalt-complex electrolytes. PVDF-HFP and PMMA polymers are employed as gelling agents to prepare these gel-type electrolytes. Although such polymers cause slow diffusion of redox couples, the related quasi-solid-state DSiPV cell still outperforms the liquid-state one under artificial-light conditions, which is attributed to the suppressed charge recombination at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. By regulating the PVDF-HFP/PMMA ratio and the electrolyte composition, this charge recombination can further be inhibited, thereby creating higher open-circuit voltages. Furthermore, in order to increase short-circuit currents, a cosensitization system and a polymeric catalyst are introduced, which respectively can broaden the light-harvesting region and facilitate interfacial charge transfer at the counter electrode. Consequently, the resultant quasi-solid-state DSiPV cell not only exhibits long-term stability during a 2000 h test, but also achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 25% under 1000-lux fluorescent lighting. The above materials are further utilized to assemble bifacial DSiPVs; the PCE obtained under rear illumination can surpass 91% of the front-illuminated value. Large-area module devices are also demonstrated herein, expressing the ability of powering small electronics in a fluorescent-light environment. This quasi-solid-state DSiPV technology is promising for self-powered electronics in the internet of things.

Utilization of solar energy is considered as a very promising way to generate power for the future “low-carbon” society. Outdoor photovoltaics, such as solar cells, have been vigorously developed in the past several decades. Recently, on account of the rapid growth of portable electronics, the internet of things (IoT) and self-sustainable smart housing, indoor photovoltaics, which generate electricity via “recycling” artificial light, have attracted a lot of attention; this technology can not only charge conventional batteries, but also fulfill the demand for a local and semi-permanent energy source for the low-power consumption sensors and actuators in wireless IoT networks. Moreover, it has been reported that the ideal maximum efficiencies of indoor photovoltaics are around 46% and 58% under fluorescent and white light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, respectively. These stunning efficiency values are attributable to the narrower emission spectra of artificial lighting in comparison to terrestrial sunlight. Normally, artificial lighting is made based on the sensitivity of human eyes, implying that its emission spectrum lies mostly within the visible-light wavelength region. Accordingly, both the design and performance of indoor photovoltaics should differ somewhat from those of conventional outdoor photovoltaics.

Various types of indoor photovoltaics have been reported, including silicon, III–V semiconductors, organic/polymeric materials, perovskite and dye-sensitized ones. The highest conversion efficiency of indoor photovoltaics achieved so far has been 36.2% under 1000-lux fluorescent lighting for a device using a triple-anion perovskite film. However, the stability issue is still a major concern in organic/polymeric and perovskite photovoltaics. On the other hand, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), a promising candidate of the next-generation photovoltaic technology, have drawn a lot of attention during the last twenty years. Due to the ease of fabrication, the manufacturing cost of the DSC is relatively lower than those of the silicon and III–V solar cells; more importantly, compared to other well-developed solar cell technologies, the better performance of DSCs under indoor/artificial lighting has been demonstrated by several research groups. In terms of indoor photovoltaics, therefore, the DSC has more potential for future advances.
Until now, owing to the uses of judiciously designed dye and redox couple materials, the conversion efficiency of the DSC based on the conventional structure has surpassed 13% under standard 1-sun irradiation. In 2017, Kim and co-workers reported a record efficiency of 14.64% for the DSC using a newly designed donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) dye and a parallel-connected tandem structure. Regarding DSC performance under indoor/artificial lighting, several efforts have been devoted to its improvement. An eminent indoor DSC was reported in 2016 by Freitag et al.; by employing a cosensitization system, cooper-complex redox couples and PEDOT catalysts, an efficiency of 25.5% under 200-lux warm white indoor lighting was obtained. In 2017–2018, Yeh's and Wei's groups developed various dye materials and sensitization systems; they achieved efficiency of 28.6% under 6000-lux fluorescent lighting. In 2018, a new DSC architecture was proposed by Grätzel and co-workers, and the relevant laboratory and large-area devices exhibited impressive efficiencies of 31.8% and 26.4%, respectively, under 1000-lux fluorescent lighting. Very recently, Freitag and co-workers demonstrated copper-mediated devices with record indoor DSC efficiencies of 34.0% (liquid) and 30.0% (solid state) under 1000-lux fluorescent lighting; furthermore, the relevant indoor DSC array could power autonomous IoT devices for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.
Electrolyte, a crucial part of the DSC, is responsible for the transportation of charge carriers between electrodes. Liquid-type electrolytes have been extensively utilized in DSCs due to their high conductivity and good interfacial wetting ability. Almost all of the high-performance DSCs discussed above used liquid electrolytes. However, the devices with liquid electrolytes often suffer from some practical problems, such as leakage and volatilization of organic solvents, and desorption of dye materials, which deteriorate the long-term stability of devices. A good answer to these worries is quasi-solid-state electrolyte. Herein, we propose dye-sensitized indoor photovoltaics (DSiPVs) featuring the use of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/poly(methylmethacrylate) (PVDF-HFP/PMMA) polymer blend electrolytes. To the best of our knowledge, this polymer blend system has not been utilized to prepare quasi-solid-state cobalt-complex electrolytes. The experimental results show that under artificial lighting, the quasi-solid-state DSiPV cell prepared using PVDF-HFP/PMMA blends outperforms the traditional liquid-state one, and it also possesses negligible mass transport limitations that are usually observed under the 1 sun condition; more importantly, good long-term stability of this quasi-solid-state cell is verified. A series of strategies is further carried out to improve the indoor performance, including modification of the electrolyte composition, introduction of a judicious cosensitization system and a polymeric counter electrode with high transparency and good catalytic activity. The eventual DSiPV cell displays efficiency of 25.3% under 1000-lux fluorescent lighting. In addition, bifacial-light-illuminated DSiPVs are also assembled and evaluated. Lastly, the relevant DSiPV module devices are demonstrated to power real-life small electronics. We anticipate that this study will aid the progress of indoor photovoltaics.

A starting liquid electrolyte (denoted as electrolyte A) containing 0.22 M [Co(II)(bpy)3](PF6)2, 0.05 M [Co(III)(bpy)3](PF6)3, 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and acetonitrile solvents was used to prepare quasi-solid-state gel-type electrolytes. Polymer blends based on PVDF-HFP and PMMA in various blend ratios (PVDF-HFP/PMMA = 10/0, 9/1, 8/2, by weight) were employed as gelling agents, and their addition was controlled at 7 wt% for all gel-type electrolytes. The molecular structures of the employed polymers and cobalt complexes are illustrated in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b displays photographs of the liquid electrolytes and the corresponding gel-type ones based on the 9/1 blend ratio. The gel-type electrolytes clearly reveal several fluid characteristics at 50 °C, whereas at ∼25 °C (room temperature), the electrolytes behave like jelly without apparent fluidity. Accordingly, the gel-type electrolytes were preheated before introducing them into the photovoltaic and dummy cells, and the relevant measurements were conducted after they cooled down.

The electrochemical properties of the aforementioned electrolytes are evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization. Dummy cells assembled with platinum (Pt) electrodes were adopted for these analyses. In the EIS, the measured Nyquist spectra are exhibited in Fig. 1c; an equivalent circuit is employed to derive the related impedance parameters (see Fig. S1a in the ESI). A crucial parameter of charge transfer resistance at the Pt-electrode/electrolyte interface (Rct) is discussed, which reflects the diameter of the semicircle in the high-frequency region. As listed in Table S1 (ESI), the Rct value of the liquid electrolyte A is measured as 8.32 Ω cm2, and after the gelation only by the PVDF-HFP (i.e., blend ratio = 10/0), the smaller Rct of 5.58 Ω cm2 is obtained. However, for the gel electrolytes prepared with the 9/1 and 8/2 blend ratios, the Rct values increased to 8.78 and 9.72 Ω cm2, respectively, indicating that a higher content of PMMA causes a larger Rct. Fig. 1d depicts the Tafel polarization curves of the studied electrolytes. Regarding the gel electrolyte with a blend ratio of 10/0, its polarization curve reaches plateaus at lower potentials compared to others; this result implies a smoother redox reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface and is consistent with the corresponding smallest Rct. Moreover, the limiting current densities are derived from the polarization curves, and the apparent diffusion coefficients related to the Co(bpy)33+ species are calculated. As catalogued in Table S1 (ESI), the diffusion coefficient of the gel electrolyte with a 10/0 ratio is similar to that of a liquid one (3.88 vs. 3.97 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), whereas the introduction of PMMA causes smaller diffusion coefficients (3.52–3.54 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). According to these results, the PVDF-HFP has little detrimental effect on the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes, and it can improve the interfacial charge transfer; on the contrary, the use of PMMA might degrade such electrolyte properties. It is inferred that the positive effect of the PVDF-HFP is related to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms in the PVDF-HFP molecules.
The studied electrolytes are then employed to assemble DSiPV cells. Regarding the DSiPV cells discussed at this stage, double-layered TiO2 film architectures, organic Y123 dyes, and sputtered Pt catalysts are utilized. J–V curves of these cells recorded under standard 1-sun irradiation are depicted in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI). The cell assembled using liquid electrolyte A shows a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.03 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.835 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.682, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.42%. For the quasi-solid-state cell using a gel electrolyte with the 10/0 blend ratio, the Jsc, Voc and FF are similar to those of the liquid-state one, thereby generating nearly identical PCE (7.41%). Once the PVDF-HFP and PMMA are employed simultaneously, however, the PCE of the DSiPV cell declines. Basically, the higher the PMMA content, the lower the PCE (ascribed mainly to the reduced Jsc). Clearly, the performance of the DSiPV cells is correlated with the electrochemical properties of electrolytes, that is, the larger Rct and smaller diffusion coefficients result in inferior photovoltaic behaviors under the 1-sun condition. On the other hand, the situation differs under indoor artificial-light conditions. Fig. 2b displays the J–V curves obtained in a fluorescent-light environment (200 lux); the related parameters are arranged in Table 1. The liquid-type cell exhibits a Jsc of 24.15 μA cm−2, a Voc of 0.588 V, a FF of 0.723, and a PCE of 15.0%. After the electrolyte is gelated by the PVDF-HFP only, the Jsc is enhanced to 25.82 μA cm−2 and the PCE raises to 16.8%. Besides, when the electrolyte with a 9/1 ratio is employed, the Voc increases to 0.628 V, and the PCE can be further improved to 17.7%. The 8/2 blend ratio also results in a higher Voc, but the PCE slightly decreases to 17.1%.

To figure out why the PVDF-HFP/PMMA blends can create higher Voc, the EIS measurements on the aforementioned DSiPV cells are performed (in the dark), and the related Nyquist spectra were decoded with another equivalent circuit (see Fig. S1b and S2a in the ESI). Fig. 2c and d exhibit the extracted chemical capacitance (Cμ) and recombination resistance (Rr), respectively, as a function of the corrected voltage (the voltage drops unrelated to the photoelectrode were eliminated). The tendencies of Cμ are similar for all of the cells, but regarding the Rr, the cells containing the PMMA are evidently larger. The extracted electron lifetime also reveals similar features to the Rr (see Fig. S2b in the ESI). Based on the literature, the Cμ and Rr respectively illustrate the shift of the TiO2 conduction band and the recombination of charge transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the impedance results discussed here indicate that the introduction of PMMA does not change the TiO2 energy level, but rather suppresses the charge recombination. Accordingly, in terms of the DSiPV cells containing the PMMA, the higher Voc values can be attributed to the greater suppression of charge recombination. It is deduced that these larger Rr and the aforementioned larger Rct values are related to passivation layers caused by the PMMA at the TiO2/electrolyte and Pt-electrode/electrolyte interfaces, respectively.
According to the above results, it is concluded that under high-intensity sunlight conditions, the performance of quasi-solid-state DSiPVs is affected mainly by the electrochemical properties of the employed electrolytes, while under low-intensity indoor-light conditions, the gel electrolytes with inferior properties (i.e., larger Rct and smaller diffusion coefficients) trigger less backward electron transfer inside the cells, thereby yielding higher PCE values. In addition, it is known that the cobalt-mediated DSC suffers from a limitation caused by the slow mass transport of cobalt-complex redox couples. As a result, the photocurrent transients of the liquid- and quasi-solid-state (9/1) DSiPV cells are measured. As depicted in Fig. 2e, both cells show bursts of currents at the initial stage upon exposure to the 1-sun irradiation; the currents then decline to steady-state levels in ∼1 s. This phenomenon certainly indicates the slow diffusion of oxidized mediators, i.e., Co(bpy)33+, through the mesoporous TiO2 films to the counter electrode. It is also observed that this limitation is more pronounced for the quasi-solid-state cell, which is in good agreement with the smaller diffusion coefficient of the corresponding electrolyte. Conversely, upon exposure to 350-lux fluorescent lighting, the mass transport limitation is less dominant in the studied DSiPV cells. This result thus illustrates that our quasi-solid-state DSiPV cell can perform much better with negligible mass transport limitations under indoor-light conditions; moreover, such cell outperforms the conventional liquid-state one as well.
Although the quasi-solid-state gel-type electrolytes and the related device characteristics have been investigated, two aspects remain doubtful: firstly, a few small particles suspended in the starting electrolyte were observed (see liquid electrolyte A in Fig. 1b); secondly, can the performance of quasi-solid-state DSiPVs be further improved? We consider the suspended species to be the incomplete dissolving of redox couple compounds. Hence, the composition of the liquid electrolyte is modified; the concentrations of redox couples halve, i.e., 0.11 M [Co(II)(bpy)3](PF6)2 and 0.025 M [Co(III)(bpy)3](PF6)3, while other additive concentrations remain unchanged. The resultant liquid electrolyte (denoted as electrolyte B) has no suspended species visible to the naked eye, and is further gelated by the PVDF-HFP/PMMA (9/1). The J–V curve and parameters of the corresponding DSiPV cell are shown in Fig. 3a and Table S3 (ESI), respectively. A Jsc of 25.87 μA cm−2, a Voc of 0.625 V, a FF of 0.745, and a PCE of 17.7% are measured under 200-lux fluorescent lighting. This performance is almost identical to that of the cell using the starting composition (i.e., gel electrolyte A). Besides, the performance of such cell is not influenced by the slightly increased Rct value (10.6 Ω cm2; see the Nyquist plot in the inset of Fig. 3a). Therefore, this result illustrates that under indoor lighting, half concentrations of redox couples are sufficient for the operation of the quasi-solid-state DSiPVs.
In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance, an electrolyte additive, tBP, which is known to significantly affect the device behaviors, is adjusted. At this stage, the tBP concentration in the liquid electrolyte B increases from 0.2 M to 1.2 M, and the resultant electrolyte (denoted as electrolyte C) is also gelated by the PVDF-HFP/PMMA (9/1); photographs of the relevant liquid and gel electrolytes are exhibited in Fig. 1b. The photovoltaic characteristics of the corresponding quasi-solid-state DSiPV cell are expressed in Fig. 3a and Table S3 (ESI). Increasing the tBP concentration lowers Jsc (23.92 μA cm−2), yet enhances Voc (0.692 V) and FF (0.780) values, so the PCE distinctly improves to 18.9%. The EIS analysis on the related cells is carried out. As shown in Fig. 3b, compared to the electrolyte B, the electrolyte C with a six-fold increase in the tBP concentration results in much smaller Cμ and larger Rr, indicating an upward displacement of the TiO2 conduction band and greater suppression of charge recombination. This impedance result is consistent with that reported in the literature. The enhanced Voc can be attributed to the larger Rr. The smaller Cμ is one of the two reasons for the lowered Jsc, because the elevated conduction band implies an attenuated driving force of the electron injection from the excited dyes. Moreover, the Rct nearly doubles after raising the tBP concentration (20.2 Ω cm2; see the inset of Fig. 3a), which is also responsible for the lowered Jsc.
It is known that both the higher viscosity (caused by the more tBP) and lower concentrations of redox couples result in more serious mass transport limitations under sunlight conditions; hence, photocurrent transients of the aforementioned DSiPV cells are measured. As shown in Fig. 3c, there is no burst of current in the cells using half redox couples, which suggests negligible mass transport limitations. The stability of the studied quasi-solid-state DSiPV cell is evaluated as well. It can be found in Fig. 3d that the cells with gel electrolyte C display similar efficiencies under ambient conditions over the first 1000 h stage. In the second stage, such cells are evaluated at 50 °C; the performance remains stable for the first 600 h, and gradually decays during the latter 400 h. After the two-stage test (∼2000 h in total), our quasi-solid-state DSiPVs still maintain ∼96% of the initial efficiencies. All in all, the above results do indeed confirm the stability and applicability of the ultimate gel-type electrolyte (i.e., electrolyte C gelated by the 9/1 PVDF-HFP/PMMA) for the DSiPVs.
Besides the electrolyte, the dye sensitizer and counter electrode catalyst are two other components dominating the photovoltaic performance of DSiPVs; as a result, in this work, they are studied and adjusted. In terms of the dye sensitizer, a cosensitization method is usually adopted to fabricate photoelectrodes. By wisely utilizing several dyes simultaneously, the light-absorption region can be extended, even achieving panchromatic light-absorption characteristics. Currently, fluorescent light and LED are the two artificial lighting most commonly used in real life. As exhibited in Fig. 4a, both of the emission spectra related to these artificial lighting lie mainly within the 400–700 nm wavelength region. The fluorescent spectrum consists of five distinct peaks (at 545, 612, 436, 488 and 586 nm, in order of intensity) and mild emissions from 400 to 550 nm, while the cool white LED spectrum (color temperature: 6500 K) is comprised of only a strong peak at 450 nm and broad emissions from 480 to 700 nm. The normalized external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the DSiPV cell using gel electrolyte C in conjunction with the Y123 dye, is also shown in Fig. 4a. Apparently, although this cell reveals a broad EQE spectrum, light beyond 600 nm is incompletely utilized, especially the second strongest emission peak at 612 nm in the fluorescent spectrum. Therefore, the cosensitization is implemented to substitute the single-dye sensitization.
In this study, a D–π–A dye (called D35) and a D–A–π–A dye (called XY1b) are used to fabricate cosensitized photoelectrodes; their molecular structures are depicted in Fig. 4b. The absorption spectra of the Y123, D35 and XY1b dyes in dichloromethane are exhibited in Fig. 4c. Clearly, the XY1b dye shows its maximum absorption at a longer wavelength (547 nm) compared to the Y123 (525 nm), and the corresponding molar extinction coefficient is also larger (6.80 vs. 6.60 × 104 M−1 cm−1). This result suggests that the XY1b is able to harvest photons more effectively in the wavelength region beyond 600 nm. For the D35 dye, the molar extinction coefficient at the absorption wavelength of 484 nm is 3.49 × 104 M−1 cm−1. It is inferred that by properly utilizing the XY1b and D35 dyes to harvest photons in the long- and short-wavelength regions, an EQE spectrum broader than that of the Y123 can be realized. Accordingly, three D35/XY1b cosensitization conditions are investigated: 9/1, 7/3 and 1/1. J–V curves and parameters of the corresponding DSiPV cells (gel electrolyte C) under 200-lux fluorescent lighting are shown in Fig. 4d and Table S4 (ESI), respectively. In comparison to the Y123 cell, the Voc values are slightly larger for these D35/XY1b-cosensitized cells; besides, the Jsc values also increase, except the 9/1 cosensitization. The best PCE of 20.5% is achieved for the DSiPV cell with the 7/3 cosensitization, which is mainly attributed to the highest Jsc (25.71 μA cm−2). The relevant EQE spectra are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI). Obviously, the spectrum related to the 9/1 cosensitization is relatively narrow, and the EQE values related to the 1/1 cosensitization are smaller in comparison to the 7/3 one. This EQE result is consistent with the tendency of the Jsc. The normalized EQE spectrum of the DSiPV cell with the 7/3 cosensitization is displayed in Fig. 4a, which evidently indicates that the D35/XY1b system can utilize more photons beyond 600 nm compared to the Y123 dye.
The counter electrode catalyst can also affect the photovoltaic performance, especially the DSC using cobalt-complex redox shuttles. It has been reported that the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reveals good catalytic activity with respect to the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox reaction. Consequently, herein, PEDOT materials deposited by a cyclic-potential method are adopted to substitute for the sputtered Pt catalysts. As illustrated in Fig. S4 (ESI), compared to the sputtered Pt (20.2 Ω cm2), a smaller Rct value related to the PEDOT catalyst (3.97 Ω cm2) is measured, confirming the superior catalytic activity. The transmittance spectra of the Pt and PEDOT catalysts loaded on the FTO substrates are shown in Fig. 5a; the inset displays the relevant digital photographs. Clearly, the PEDOT catalyst is much more transparent than the Pt one across the entire visible-light region, implying the suitability for bifacial-light-illuminated DSiPVs. This PEDOT catalyst is further applied to assemble quasi-solid-state DSiPV cells where gel electrolyte C and the optimal cosensitization (D35/XY1b = 7/3) are used. J–V curves under various fluorescent- and LED-light conditions are depicted in Fig. 5b and S5 (ESI), respectively, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and S5 (ESI). Under 200-lux fluorescent lighting, this cell demonstrates a high Jsc of 27.12 μA cm−2, a Voc of 0.710 V, a FF of 0.778, and a remarkable PCE of 22.0%. These Jsc and PCE values are much higher than those related to the Pt catalyst, which is consistent with the aforementioned superior catalytic activity of PEDOT. When the illuminance of the fluorescent light is increased to 1000 lux, an impressive PCE beyond 25% is achieved. This result is, to some degree, comparable to those of other high-performance indoor photovoltaics (see detailed comparison in Table S6 in the ESI); more importantly, it is the best artificial-light performance in terms of the quasi-solid-state DSiPVs. Furthermore, as expressed in Fig. 5c, under the LED-light conditions, higher Jsc and PCE values can be obtained, an indication that more photons in the LED radiative spectrum can be utilized by our DSiPV cells. It is worth mentioning that the artificial lighting at the illuminances of 200, 600 and 1000 lux is generally employed in the bedroom, office and supermarket, respectively. The above result, therefore, illustrates that our quasi-solid-state DSiPVs are definitely applicable to a great variety of artificial lighting environments.
The high transparency of the PEDOT catalyst further enables us to fabricate quasi-solid-state bifacial-light-illuminated DSiPVs. Regarding the bifacial cells discussed herein, the same gel electrolyte C and D35/XY1b cosensitization (7/3) are employed, while the mesoporous TiO2 film architecture is modified by the removal of the light-scattering layer (see detailed comparison in Fig. S6 in the ESI). The J–V curves and related parameters of the bifacial DSiPV cells under various fluorescent-lighting are shown in Fig. 5d and Table 2, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, under front illumination, the Jsc values of the bifacial cell are reduced by an average of 7.5% with respect to the conventional cell; as a result, smaller PCE values are obtained. In addition, under rear illumination, further decreases in the Jsc values are observed, which are attributed to the interception of photons by the redox couple species. However, it is worth noting that the rear-illuminated PCE values still reach more than 91.5% of the front-illuminated ones. This result is better than those reported in the literature; furthermore, it verifies the good suitability of the materials which we used for bifacial-light-illuminated DSiPVs.

In order to fulfill real-life applications, we further demonstrate the utilization of 11.2 cm2 DSiPV module devices for powering a digital timer and a time/temperature/humidity display meter under around 600-lux fluorescent lighting, as exhibited in Fig. 6. Such module devices are fabricated according to the design reported in our previous work, and the electrolyte C, Y123 dye and sputtered Pt catalyst are utilized as well. Since a voltage of 1.5 V is required to operate these commercial small electronics, two module devices are electrically connected in series, each of which has a Voc of ∼0.76 V under 600-lux fluorescent lighting (see detailed performance in Fig. S7 in the ESI). All in all, a reliable quasi-solid-state DSiPV technology and its crucial components are comprehensively studied and demonstrated in this work. We anticipate that this technology can be realized in real life and IoT-related applications in the near future.

In summary, highly efficient DSiPVs featuring quasi-solid-state electrolytes are demonstrated in this study. The cobalt-complex liquid electrolyte is first gelated by the PVDF-HFP/PMMA polymers with different blend ratios. The experimental results show that these polymer blends somewhat degrade the electrolyte properties, and that the related DSiPV cells suffer from severe mass transport limitations under 1-sun irradiation, thus causing poor performance. However, such properties and limitations are not critical under artificial-light conditions. Because of the suppressed charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, the quasi-solid-state cell based on the 9/1 blend ratio outperforms the liquid-state one, expressing a larger Voc and a PCE of 17.7% under 200-lux fluorescent lighting. This interfacial charge recombination is further inhibited by modifying the electrolyte composition; a better PCE of 18.9% is then obtained. Besides the electrolyte, a judicious cosensitization system based on the organic D35 and XY1b dyes are used to broaden the light-harvesting wavelength region. Because the photons beyond 600 nm are utilized more effectively, increases in the Jsc and PCE are observed. Moreover, an electrodeposited PEDOT material is employed to substitute for the sputtered Pt catalyst. Owing to the superior catalytic activity, the quasi-solid-state DSiPV cell assembled using PEDOT catalysts achieves a stunning PCE of 25.3% under 1000-lux fluorescent lighting. The remarkable stability of the relevant cells is also verified during a two-stage test for 2000 h. In addition, the high-transparency feature of PEDOT further enables us to assemble bifacial-light-illuminated DSiPVs where the rear-side PCE can surpass 91% of the front-side value. Lastly, large-area module devices are fabricated and their ability to power small electronics under an indoor-light condition is demonstrated. This study indicates that the proposed quasi-solid-state DSiPV technology is a promising future power source in real-life and IoT applications.


The redox couple materials, [Co(II)(bpy)3](PF6)2 and [Co(III)(bpy)3](PF6)3, were synthesized according to the reported literature. The starting liquid electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.22 M [Co(II)(bpy)3](PF6)2, 0.05 M [Co(III)(bpy)3](PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M tBP into the acetonitrile solvent; concentrations of cobalt complexes and tBP could be altered as mentioned in the main text. Quasi-solid-state electrolytes were prepared by the gelation of liquid electrolytes with different PVDF-HFP/PMMA blend ratios. First, PVDF-HFP was introduced into the liquid electrolytes, and the mixtures were placed at 70 °C for 1 h. The mixtures were then gently stirred at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of PMMA. Next, another stirring at 70 °C for 30 min was conducted to dissolve the polymer materials. The eventual electrolytes had a homogeneous phase, and at ambient conditions, they enter a gel state.


Photoelectrodes were first prepared. The FTO substrates were cleaned in sequence with detergent, deionized water and ethanol. The cleaned FTO substrates were heated at 450 °C by a hot plate, and an ethanolic solution containing 0.1 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) was manually sprayed onto the substrates 24 times for the deposition of compact blocking layers. Next, TiO2 films with a double-layered architecture were screen-printed onto the sprayed substrates, followed by sintering at 500 °C in air; the thickness of the transparent and light-scattering layers is 9.4 ± 0.4 and 4.9 ± 0.2 μm, respectively (see Fig. S6 in the ESI). The active area of each TiO2 films is 4 × 4 mm2. Afterwards, a post-treatment was carried out (40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution, 70 °C, 30 min). The dye sensitization was then performed on the TiCl4-treated TiO2/FTO substrates for 6 h. For the Y123 sensitization, the dye solution contains 0.1 mM Y123 in the acetonitrile/tert-butanol cosolvent (1/1 by volume). For the D35/XY1b cosensitization, the same cosolvent was used, and three kinds of solutions were prepared, 0.09 mM D35 and 0.01 mM XY1b; 0.07 mM D35 and 0.03 mM XY1b; and 0.05 mM D35 and 0.05 mM XY1b. After the sensitization, complete photoelectrodes were achieved.

The DSiPV cell has a sandwich architecture. A complete photoelectrode and a counter electrode were assembled with a hot-melt sealing Surlyn (30 μm thick). Electrolytes were then injected into the assembled cell through predrilled holes on the counter electrode. Regarding the quasi-solid-state cell, the related electrolyte was preheated at 70 °C prior to the injection. Symmetrical dummy cells for evaluating the electrochemical properties of the electrolytes were assembled in a similar manner, while two Pt-deposited electrodes and a 60 μm Surlyn were adopted. The design of large-area module devices was similar to that of our previous DSC modules. The detailed fabrication processes of such module devices were reported elsewhere; however, in this work, the TiO2 paste for the transparent layer, the employed electrolyte and dye materials were different.
