It is of great importance to develop counter electrodes (CEs) as an alternative for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Here, single-walled Cu7S4 nanoboxes (SW-Cu7S4-NBs) and double-walled heterostructured Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4 nanoboxes (DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs) are synthesized by a facile in situ inward etching/sacrificial template method based on the Kirkendall effect. A remarkably enhanced and stable electrocatalytic activity is achieved for the QDSSC based on the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE, which is inclusively derived from the high intrinsic electron conductivity of Cu2−xSe, the stimulated electron transfer process and abundant active catalytic sites due to the enlarged specific surface area, higher utilization efficiency of incident light of the unique double-walled hollow structure, and the formation of a heterogeneous nanostructure. As a result, the QDSSC based on the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE exhibits a PCE of 4.38% under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) irradiation, while 3.97%, 3.43% and 1.54% were found for SW-Cu7S4-NB, Pt and brass/Cu2S based CEs, respectively. Furthermore, it is suggested that the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE still shows superior long-term stability towards the polysulfide electrolyte even after 600 cycles.

Developing low cost and high performance solar cells is one of the most effective routes to fulfilling the requirements for inexhaustible clean energy. Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are attracting increased attention due to their significant advantages including low cost, a low temperature solution fabrication technique and relatively high light-to-electricity conversion efficiency, which share a similar principle to dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Much effort has been made on QDSSCs including adopting various valid QD sensitizers, electrolytes with excellent redox couples, counter electrodes (CEs) with superior electrocatalytic activity, and improved photoanodes.

As a critical component in sandwich like QDSSCs, the CE collects and transports electrons from the external circuit, catalyzes the reduction of Sn2− to S2− at the CE/electrolyte interface and reflects incident light from the working electrode back to the photoanode film. Consequently, CE materials with high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, outstanding long-term stability and good reflection of incident light, play important roles in the performance enhancement of QDSSCs. However, the strong chemisorption of Pt CEs may lead to a decreased catalytic activity of the CE and an increased electron transfer resistance at the interface of the CE and the electrolyte, resulting in a low fill factor (FF). Furthermore, the delayed charge transfer to the oxidized Sn2− species at the CE would induce an undesirable overpotential and lead to the loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE). Therefore, it is highly imperative to exploit alternative low-cost and efficient CE materials for QDSSCs. Among the reported non-platinum CE materials in QDSSCs, transition metal chalcogenides (CoS2, MoS2, NiS, Cu2ZnSnS4 (ref. 8)), conducting polymers and carbon-based materials are extensively applied as ideal candidates due to their superior catalytic activity towards polysulfide species. For example, brass/Cu2S CEs display the advantage of relatively high electrocatalytic activity, exhibiting a PCE of 4.21%. However, in situ formed brass/Cu2S CEs usually suffer from continuous corrosion in polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in the instability of cells.
Recently research indicated that copper selenide-based CEs show great potential to improve the performance of QDSSCs because of their excellent catalytic activity and lower transfer resistance than copper sulfide-based CEs. Copper selenides have analogous interior structures to copper sulfides, but higher conductivity. It has been well known that copper selenide is a very important cationic defect p-type semiconductor, can exist in a wide range of stoichiometric compositions (Cu2Se, CuSe, Cu3Se2, CuSe2, Cu5Se4 and Cu7Se4) and nonstoichiometric (Cu2−xSe) compounds, and can be further constructed into several crystallographic forms (monoclinic, cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal). Among them, Cu2−xSe is reported to show adjustable band-gap energy and unique optical and electrical properties. In particular, Cu2−xSe, as a face-centered cubic (fcc) berzelianite phase with the space group Fm3m, possesses not only a direct band gap of 2.2 eV, but also an indirect band gap of 1.4 eV for x = 0.2.
In addition to their intrinsic nature, the morphologies and active surface areas of CE materials can have a profound impact on the efficiency of QDSSCs. Consequently, two of the momentous factors in the performance of CE materials are the active surface areas and the microstructures. Recently, copper chalcogenides with different morphologies, such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanosheets, have been employed as CE materials for QDSSCs. Dou et al. fabricated hierarchical Cu2−xSe nanotubes with a surface area of 13.34 m2 g−1, with Cu nanowires as sacrificial templates, and the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs based on the as-prepared Cu2−xSe CEs was 6.3%, which is much higher than that of Au (2.68%). It is shown that hollow nanostructures display the advantages of both high surface area and low density, which thus facilitate the diffusion of polysulfide species and provide abundant active sites for the catalytic reduction of redox species. In particular, compared with single-walled hollow structures, a series of features including the specific surface area, surface active sites, microporosity and surface–interface effect of multi-walled hollow structures can be greatly enhanced along with an increment of wall numbers. Particularly, heterogeneous nanostructures composed of two or more distinct inorganic materials with different properties (band-gap, conductivity, expansion coefficient, etc.) can achieve an optimized multi-functionalization and synergistic effect. Previous studies have indicated that the formation of heterogeneous nanostructures may combine the profitable characteristics of the single components and effectively improve the optical and electrochemical properties.
Herein, a combined strategy of in situ inward etching and use of a sacrificial template based on the Kirkendall effect is successfully developed to synthesize single-walled Cu7S4 nanoboxes (SW-Cu7S4-NBs) and double-walled Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4 heterostructured NBs (DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-NBs) at room temperature by using Cu2O nanocubes as templates. The QDSSC based on the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-NB CE shows enhanced and stable electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of polysulfide in the QDSSC and yields a PCE of 4.38% under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination, superior to the PCE of brass/Cu2S (3.43%) and Pt CEs (1.54%), respectively. The outstanding performance is attributed to the good conductivity and high electrochemical activity of the heterostructured Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4 materials, which have been verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel polarization, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement.

Cubic Cu2O templates were synthesized by a modified method from a previous report. A 0.01 M Se2− precursor was prepared by mixing NaOH (5 mM), Se (0.01 M) and NaBH4 (0.05 M) together. In a typical procedure of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, firstly, the Cu2O/Cu2−xSe core/shell nanocubes were obtained by adding Cu2O templates to 100 mL of Se2− solution (0.006 M) for 15 min under magnetic stirring. Secondly, the partial Cu2O cores were dissolved with an ammonia solution (5 wt%) and stirred for another 10 min. Thirdly, the Cu2O/Cu2−xSe core/shell products were immersed in Na2S solution (0.006 M) for another 10 min under magnetic stirring. Finally, after an additional 30 min of the ammonia solution etching process under magnetic stirring, black products were collected, washed and dried in a vacuum oven. The synthesis of SW-Cu7S4-NBs is similar except without the addition of the Se2− precursor and one cycle of the etching procedure was performed.


SW-Cu7S4-NB and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB powders were prepared into pastes according to previous work with some modifications. Cu2S/brass CEs were fabricated by a universal method according to the previous literature; brass foil was etched in 0.6 M HCl solution at 90 °C for 5 min. Pt CEs were prepared according to the reported technique. 50 mL of 0.01 M H2PtCl6 ethanol solution was spin-coated on FTO glass, followed by sintering at 400 °C for 30 min to form Pt CEs.


The integrated TiO2 photoanode is composed of four consecutive layers, i.e., a 100 nm thick compact layer, an 8 μm thick transparent layer, a 4 μm thick scattering layer, and a 100 nm thick compact layer. The synthesis of 300 nm scattering TiO2 particles can be found elsewhere. The TiO2 compact layers were deposited on cleaned FTO glass by dip coating in TiCl4 (0.04 M) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. Mesoporous TiO2 films including the transparent and scattering layers were prepared by a spin coating technique according to our previous work. The resultant TiO2 film was sensitized with CdS and CdSe QDs by chemical bath deposition (CBD) according to the reported literature.


Sandwich-type QDSSCs were assembled by sealing each aforementioned CE (DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, SW-Cu7S4-NBs, brass/Cu2S and Pt) and the as-prepared CdS/CdSe QDs sensitized TiO2. A Surlyn film (DuPont™ Surlyn® 1702, thickness of 60 μm) with a square window adapted to the photoanode was used as the sealing material between photoanodes and CEs. The polysulfide electrolyte consisting of Na2S (2 M), S (2 M), and KCl (0.2 M) in deionized water was injected into the cell via a hole pre-drilled on the CE, and finally the hole on the CE was sealed. Symmetric dummy cells for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements were assembled using two identical CEs and the same polysulfide electrolyte was employed. The effective area of both the dummy cells and QDSSCs was defined to be 0.16 cm2.


X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max-KA X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The morphology, microstructure and chemical composition of the samples were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU-70) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2100) and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, ESCALAB 250). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were acquired at 77 K using a Gold APP V-Sorb 2800 surface area and porosity analyzer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a scanning probe microscope with a NanoScope IIIa (Dimension 3100) in the tapping mode was used to estimate the surface roughness of the samples and the scans were extended over 5 × 5 μm2 areas. The photovoltaic performance (J–V curves and IPCE plots) of the fabricated QDSSCs was recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator under AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel, Model No. 91192, 150 W xenon lamp) and a Keithley 2000 multimeter with illumination from a 300 W tungsten lamp incorporated with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator, respectively. The electrochemical measurements including electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Tafel polarization plots of symmetric cells (CE/electrolyte/CE) and the CV studies of the three electrode cell were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Model CHI604D). The three electrode cell was fabricated by using Pt as the counter electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and the three types of copper chalcogenide (DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, SW-Cu7S4-NBs, Cu2S/brass) CEs as the working electrodes.


A combined preparation strategy of an in situ inward etching process and a sacrificial template approach to synthesize SW-Cu7S4-NBs and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs is visually displayed in Scheme 1. There are five steps in the synthesis of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs: (1) the very first step involved the formation of uniform Cu2O nanocubes and appropriate Se2− precursors. (2) Since the solubility product constant of copper selenide (Ksp = 10−61) is orders of magnitude lower than that of Cu2O which is close to Cu(OH)2 species (Ksp = 10−20), the Cu2O/Cu2−xSe core/shell nanostructures were formed in situ from the initial Cu2O template once Cu2O was mixed with Se2− under certain conditions (step I). (3) The internal Cu2O cores were dissolved partially in ammonia solution through accurately controlling the dissolution time (step II), leading to the formation of a gap between the Cu2−xSe shell and the unreacted Cu2O core. (4) The Cu2O core/Cu2−xSe shell/Cu7S4 shell nanostructures can be obtained via controlled sulfidation of the undissolved Cu2O core (step III). (5) Finally, the inner Cu2O core was completely etched to form DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs (step IV). The synthesis principle of the SW-Cu7S4-NBs is similar to the above process of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs except without the addition of the Se2− precursor, as displayed in Scheme 1. The similar formation mechanism of SW-Cu7S4-NBs and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs is known as the Kirkendall effect which determines the supply of copper ions and diffusion of copper ions and selenium or sulfur ions through the Cu2−xSe or Cu7S4 layer. Transmission election microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to verify the formation process of SW-Cu7S4-NBs and DW- Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs. The reaction processes are described as the following equations.

Se + 4NaOH + NaBH4 → Na2Se + Na3BO3 + 3H2O
(1)
14Cu2O + 16S2− + O2 + 16H2O → 4Cu7S4 + 32OH−
(2)
2Cu2O + 16NH3·H2O + O2 → 4[Cu(NH3)4]2+ + 8OH− + 12H2O
(3)
2(2 − x)Cu2O + 4Na2Se + 4H2O + xO2 → 4Cu2−xSe + 8NaOH
(4)
2Cu2O + 16NH3·H2O + O2 → 4[Cu(NH3)4]2+ + 8OH− + 12H2O

Fig. 1a–e depict the TEM images of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs obtained at various synthetic stages of the entire process. As shown in Fig. 1f, the diffraction peaks centered at 29.55°, 36.42°, 42.30°, 61.34° and 73.53° can be indexed to the (110), (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of cubic Cu2O (JCPDF 05-0667). Fig. 1g shows the XRD pattern of partially dissolved Cu2O/Cu2−xSe core/shell nanocubes with an interior gap. The diffraction peaks (marked with red circles) of cubic Cu2−xSe (JCPDF 06-0680) appear in the Cu2O precursor after selenylation step (marked with blue triangles), indicating the formation of Cu2−xSe, while all other peaks are assigned to Cu2O. It should be emphasized, however, that the diffraction peak intensity of Cu2O is nonetheless strong, illustrating the existence of a considerable amount of Cu2O in Cu2O/Cu2−xSe core/shell nanostructures. Fig. 1h indicates that after the Cu2O/Cu2−xSe nanocubes are partially etched by ammonia solution, the intensity of the diffraction peaks ((111), (200) and (220)) of Cu2O templates become weaker. Fig. 1i presents the XRD pattern of the Cu2O core/Cu2−xSe shell/Cu7S4 shell nanostructures through the sulfidation process, from which we can see that the diffraction peaks (marked with green squares) can be indexed to the (1821) and (886) facets corresponding to monoclinic Cu7S4 (JCPDF 23-958), indicating the appearance of a Cu7S4 phase, and Cu2O and Cu2−xSe species still remain in the product. As shown in Fig. 1j, the Cu2O phase cannot be distinctly detected anymore after the Cu2O core is etched completely; the diffraction peaks located at 26.75°, 44.60° and 52.91° correspond well with the (111), (220) and (311) planes of cubic Cu2−xSe, while the other peaks observed at 28.22°, 31.20°, 46.84° and 48.90° can be attributed to the diffraction from the (604), (1821), (0160) and (886) planes of monoclinic Cu7S4, and no impurities could be found. A more intuitive forming process of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs can be observed using the TEM images shown in Fig. 1a–e, from which five samples can be observed. Fig. 1a reveals the smooth surface morphology and uniform size of the Cu2O nanocubes. As shown in Fig. 1b, after the Cu2O nanocubes are immersed in Se2− solution, a layer of Cu2−xSe first forms on the Cu2O surface and the Cu2O/Cu2−xSe core/shell nanocubes become rough. Then a void is gradually formed between the Cu2−xSe shell and the remnant Cu2O core through the etching process and can be observed in Fig. 1c. Finally, Fig. 1e exhibits the Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4 heterostructured nanoboxes with double shells after the sulfidation step and the complete removal of the Cu2O core, and both the external Cu2−xSe shell and internal Cu7S4 shell are very rough. The synthesis process of SW-Cu7S4-NBs verified by TEM and XRD is also shown in Fig. S1. For the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs the FESEM images and the color variation digital photos of the synthesis process are shown in Fig. S2.

Compared to SW-Cu7S4-NBs (Fig. S3), DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs have a relatively complicated structure, which can be observed from the FESEM results. The low magnification SEM image in Fig. 2a reveals that DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs inherit both the cubic morphology and uniform size of the Cu2O templates with an outer edge length of 1 um. An individual broken nanobox is shown in Fig. 2d; a gap between the two shells (cubic Cu2−xSe and the monoclinic Cu7S4 respectively) can be clearly observed, revealing the formation of an extraordinary double-walled heterostructure. The magnified SEM images also show that both the inner and outer surfaces of the sample are very rough and extremely different from the smooth surface of Cu2O nanocubes. As stated, the high specific surface area originating from the coarse surfaces and the inner voids can provide more active sites and facilitate polysulfide diffusion, thus providing QDSSCs with improved electrocatalytic activity and excellent photovoltaic performance, which will be discussed in a later section. In particular, with regard to DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, much more surfaces and larger surface accessibility can be achieved due to its double-layered structure. Thus, this is the reason why we designed the unique double-walled nanostructure for the CE of the QDSSC. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum shown in Fig. S4a suggests that DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs are composed of Cu, Se and S. Fig. S4b–d give the typical EDS elemental mapping images of double-walled Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4 nanoboxes, obviously indicating the uniform distribution of Cu, Se and S throughout the whole nanobox. The EDS spectrum and elemental mapping images of SW-Cu7S4-NBs are shown in Fig. S5.

Structural information on DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs and SW-Cu7S4-NBs are further elucidated using their TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. The low magnification TEM image in Fig. 3a reveals the hollow structure of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs with a uniform edge length. The difference in the contrast of bright and dark areas is sufficient evidence for the porous structure. Careful observation of a single broken DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB in Fig. 3b further confirms the double-walled structure of the nanobox. Based on the enlarged TEM image, the outer and inner sizes of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs are estimated to be about 1 μm and 700 nm respectively. The outer Cu2−xSe shell and inner Cu7S4 shell thicknesses of the double-walled nanobox are estimated to be about 70 nm. The HRTEM image recorded from a small particle in Fig. 3c shows that the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs are assembled by nanoparticles with high crystallinity. The corresponding SAED pattern is obtained to determine the crystal nature of the sample, as displayed in Fig. 3d. DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs show a single crystal nature. An interplanar spacing of 0.333 nm could be clearly observed in Fig. 3c and corresponds well to the (111) plane. The diffraction spots in Fig. 3d correspond well with those of the (16 0 0), (0 16 0) and (16 16 0) planes of the monoclinic Cu7S4 phase and the (111), (200) and (311) planes of the cubic Cu2−xSe phase. The TEM images and SAED pattern of the as-prepared SW-Cu7S4-NBs are shown in Fig. S6.
Since a rough surface possesses more available surfaces and can provide more catalytic sites, the surface roughness plays a crucial role in electron transfer and polysulfide diffusion and further determines the catalytic activity of the CE materials. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements are carried out. Surface roughness parameters including Rmax (maximum surface roughness), Ra (the average roughness) and Rms (root mean square roughness) of the SW-Cu7S4-NBs and the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs are estimated from the AFM images shown in Fig. S7 and summarized in Table 1. Specifically, Rmax represents the maximum roughness height within a sample length, Ra is defined as the arithmetic mean of the areas of all profile values of the roughness profile (the average roughness) and Rms is the root-mean-square calculation of all profile values of the roughness profile and regarded as the key parameter to state the surface roughness. As indicated in Table 1, all roughness parameters of the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB sample are larger than those of SW-Cu7S4-NBs. Particularly, the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB sample shows a larger Rms value (2.61 nm) than SW-Cu7S4-NBs (1.51 nm). This result indicates that the surface of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs is coarser than that of SW-Cu7S4-NBs, which can accelerate the diffusion process of electrons and polysulfide electrolytes in the QDSSC devices to eventually exhibit the best electrocatalytic performance.

The textural properties including Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and the porous nature of the SW-Cu7S4-NBs and the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs are characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. Fig. 4 depicts the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution curves of the samples. Fig. 4a displays two similar curves, in which typical type IV isotherms with an H1 hysteresis loop are observed, indicating the mesoporous nature of the SW-Cu7S4-NBs and the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs. The pore size distribution curves obtained by BJH analysis are shown in Fig. 4b, suggesting pore sizes of 12.62 nm (DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs) and 7.99 nm (SW-Cu7S4-NBs). The textural parameters including specific surface area, pore size and pore volume of the SW-Cu7S4-NBs and the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs are shown in Table 2. After the Cu2−xSe phase is incorporated into the Cu7S4 matrix, the specific surface area increases from 32.84 to 69.51 m2 g−1, which is attributed to the formation of a double-walled hollow structure. A previous study shows that hollow structures with double shells display higher specific surface area compared to single shell hollow structures. Furthermore, the pore size and pore volume of the two samples display a similar trend to that of the surface area, decreasing from 7.99 to 12.62 nm and 0.42 to 0.47 cm3 g−1, respectively. It is generally believed that the specific surface area is of vital importance for enhanced performance of QDSSCs, because a larger surface area may provide abundant active sites to absorb the polysulfide species, leading to the improved electrochemical properties. Also, the larger pore size and pore volume of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs are beneficial for the transport of polysulfide redox species and the absorption of electrolyte into the interior shell. Thus DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE based QDSSCs may yield a better performance than SW-Cu7S4-NBs CE based QDSSCs on account of the higher specific surface area, which will be discussed in the following chapter.

In order to further investigate the quantitative chemical composition and valence state, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is conducted. As for DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, Fig. 5a presents the survey XPS spectrum, which clearly reveals the peaks of O 1s, C 1s and S 2p along with Cu 2p and Se 3d, and no other impurities are observed. As shown in Fig. 5b, the core level spectrum of the Cu 2p region manifests binding energies located at 932.3 and 952.2 eV ascribed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, and proves the presence of Cu+ in the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs. Also, the binding energies located at 934.7 and 954.5 eV are ascribed to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, and prove the presence of Cu2+ in the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs. In addition, a very weak peak corresponding to the satellite peak of Cu+ at 943.4 eV is observed, which is similar to that of the previous work. Fig. 5c shows the core level spectrum of the S 2p region of the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, which reveals that binding energies of 162.5 eV and 163.5 eV are attributed to S2p 3/2 and S2p 1/2, respectively, which also reveals the presence of S2− coordinated to Cu+ and Cu2+ species in the sample. Meanwhile, the binding energy centered at around 167–169 eV (shown with arrows in Fig. 5c) matches with that of S–O bonding resulting from the oxidation effect. Besides, the core level spectrum of the Se 3d region is displayed in Fig. 5d, in which the values at 53.7 and 54.4 eV are attributed to the binding energies of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, indicating the formation of the Cu2−xSe phase. The Se 3d region suggests the presence of Se2−, whereas the weaker shoulder peaks (as arrowed in Fig. 5d) may be derived from the oxidation of Se2− ions (maybe SeO32−) on the surface of the products. The XPS spectra of SW-Cu7S4-NBs are shown in Fig. S8.

As a vital component in sandwich structured QDSSCs, besides the function of collection and transport of electrons from the external circuit and catalysing the process of the reduction of Sn2−/ S2− couples, the CE material also plays a role in reflecting incident light transmitted from the working electrode back to the photoanode (TiO2) film and enhancing the utilization efficiency of incident light. Therefore, the UV-vis spectra are shown in Fig. 6a to characterize the light reflection of CE materials. Compared to the SW-Cu7S4-NB sample, the obvious increased light reflection is observed for the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB sample due to the formation of a unique double-walled hollow heterostructure, because hollow structures with double shells favor the reflection of light compared with single-walled hollow structures. This result demonstrates that the copper chalcogenide possesses a comparable light reflection characteristic with Pt CE and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs CE shows higher utilization efficiency of incident light, which is beneficial to promoting the performance. The systematic diagram of the QDSSC is explicitly displayed in Fig. 6b. The elemental mapping images of the photoanode shown in Fig. S9a–c show that the Cd, Se and S elements are uniformly distributed in the TiO2 electrode, and the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. S9d reveals that the thickness of the CdSe/CdS sensitized TiO2 film is about 12 μm including a bottom transparent layer and a scattering layer.

The photovoltaic properties of the QDSSCs assembled with various CEs including SW-Cu7S4-NBs, DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, Cu2S/brass and Pt are investigated. Fig. 6c shows the photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) plots of the QDSSCs. The relevant photovoltaic performance parameters including the short circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), power conversion efficiency (η) and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 6c, the PCE of the four devices abides by the following trend: DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs > SW-Cu7S4-NBs > brass/Cu2S > Pt based QDSSC. As expected, the QDSSCs fabricated with SW-Cu7S4-NB and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CEs exhibit improved power conversion efficiency, owing to the augmentation in all photovoltaic parameters including JSC, VOC and FF. The QDSSC based on DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs has better PCE than that based on SW-Cu7S4-NBs, which increases from 3.97% for SW-Cu7S4-NBs to 4.38% for DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs. The QDSSC based on the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE exhibits a higher JSC of 23.02 mA cm−2 than the SW-Cu7S4-NB CE (22.18 mA cm−2) based device, indicating the facilitated reduction of S2−/Sn2− couples. Furthermore, the remarkable increase in the FF of the QDSSC with the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE is ascribed to the higher electrical conductivity.

The monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum which is highly related to the photocurrent response and incident light of the solar cells is used to further explore the effects of the CEs on the performance of the QDSSCs. As shown in Fig. 6d, the IPCE values follow the same trend as the PCE, reaching maximum IPCE values of 35% and 56% for SW-Cu7S4-NBs and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, respectively, which is fairly consistent with the JSC as listed in Table 3. This result further confirms that Cu2−xSe possesses super catalytic activity in the reduction of polysulfide redox species, and shows great potential for substituting noble metals and commonly used Cu2S in high efficiency QDSSCs.

In order to elucidate the catalytic activity and charge transfer processes of the CEs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are carried out using symmetrical dummy cells. The equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7c is provided to fit the EIS spectra using the Z-View software; the fitting results of the impedance spectra including the ohmic series resistance (RS), charge transfer resistance at the solid–solid interface (RCT1) and charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte–CE interface (RCT2) are listed in Table 4. As shown in Fig. 7a, the intercept on the horizontal coordinate, the first arch in the high frequency region and the second arch in the lower frequency region correspond to RS, RCT1 and RCT2, respectively. On the basis of the data from Tables 3 and 4, the RS values of the CEs follow the order of brass/Cu2S (27.73 Ω) < DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs (36.91 Ω) < SW-Cu7S4-NBs (85.01 Ω) < Pt (93.85 Ω), while the FF values for the different CEs display the opposite order. This result is well consistent with the result that a smaller RS could lead to a larger FF. The DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB based CE shows a smaller series resistance (RS) of 36.91 Ω, which reveals its higher electrical conductivity and coincides well with the fact that Cu2−xSe possesses superior intrinsic conductivity reported in previous studies. Compared to the huge difference in RCT2 values for the various CEs (94.86 Ω, 44.37 Ω, 350.49 Ω and 590.45 Ω for SW-Cu7S4-NBs, DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs, brass/Cu2S and Pt CEs, respectively), the RS and RCT1 are not remarkably different and contribute very little to the enhancement of catalytic activity. Thus RCT2 is the most crucial factor to determine the catalytic activity of CEs; SW-Cu7S4-NB and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB based CEs exhibit better catalytic performance than that of the brass/Cu2S CE, which is consistent with the increased Jsc and Voc displayed in Table 3. Because the FF of all copper sulfide CEs is similar, the catalytic activity of the CEs is mainly determined using JSC; therefore higher Jsc manifests better catalytic activity. So SW-Cu7S4-NB and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB based CEs exhibit better performance than the brass/Cu2S CE. In detail, the RCT2 value of the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE (44.37 Ω) is much lower than that of the SW-Cu7S4-NB CE (94.86 Ω), because both the external and internal shells of the unique double-walled hollow structure can be utilized as active sites, which eventually results in the highest catalytic activity of the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE. Combining this result with BET measurement, compared with the SW-Cu7S4-NB CE with a specific surface area of 32.84 m2 g−1, the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE with larger surface area (69.51 m2 g−1) exhibits the smallest RCT2, revealing that CEs with a larger surface area can significantly accelerate the charge transfer process and lead to superior electrocatalytic activity.

Tafel polarization measurements are also performed with the dummy cells to further investigate the catalytic activity of the various CEs. The Tafel curve can be divided into three regions including the polarization region, Tafel region and diffusion zone. The catalytic activity of the different CEs can be evaluated by the exchange current density (J0) and limiting diffusion current density (Jlim). The exchange current density (J0) is defined as the intercept of the extrapolated linear zone of the Tafel region in the cathodic and anodic branches under zero potential and the intercept on the vertical coordinate of the diffusion zones in the Tafel curve represents the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) value. According to the calculation using eqn (1), the larger slope of CEs represents a larger J0, where the J0 values can be estimated from the EIS measurements, and the variation trend expectedly agrees well with that acquired from the Tafel analysis, that is, the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE predictably exhibited the best catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 7d, the Jlim values from the diffusion region vary in the same order as the J0 values, indicating the largest D value for DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs among all the CEs, according to eqn (1). The increased Jlim implies that the double-walled hollow nanostructure can expedite the diffusion of the redox couple. In short, the increased J0 and Jlim in the Tafel-polarization analysis jointly indicate that DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CEs have the highest catalytic activity.

Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests are carried out to probe the stability of the different CEs by employing a three-electrode device filled with sulfide/polysulfide redox electrolyte which was also used in symmetrical dummy cells. Fig. 7e shows the first 50 cycles, in which we can see that the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE and SW-Cu7S4-NB CE are much more stable than the brass/Cu2S CE in the polysulfide electrolyte, and the highly superposed lines of the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE indicate it exhibiting the best stability among the CEs. The inferior stability of the brass/Cu2S CE is due to its inevitable and continuous corrosion in the polysulfide electrolyte. To further explore the long-term stability of the two CEs, a total of 600 cycles of CV measurements were carried out and the CV curves are shown in Fig. 7f. The result demonstrates that the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE still exhibits outstanding cycling stability compared to others even after 600 cycles, which further proves that DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs indeed have excellent long-term stability and are suitable as CEs for QDSSCs. The excellent long-term stability of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs derives from the poor solubility of Cu7S4 and Cu2−xSe species in the polysulfide electrolyte.
The improved photovoltaic performance and electrocatalytic activity of the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB based QDSSC are mainly derived from the following four independent aspects. Firstly, the incorporated Cu2−xSe phase has a special higher intrinsic conductivity nature compared with copper sulfides such as Cu2S and Cu7S4. Secondly, the unique double-walled hollow structure possesses a verifiable larger surface active area, which could provide more active sites to catalyse the reduction of S2−/Sn2−, and thus facilitate the diffusion of electrolytes and accelerate electron transport. Thirdly, the formation of a unique double-walled hollow structure can effectively reflect incident light, which thus shows higher utilization efficiency of incident light. Fourthly, the heterogeneous nanostructure may combine the profitable characteristics and exhibit improved optical and electrochemical properties. The excellent long-term stability of DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs is derived from the poor solubility of Cu7S4 and Cu2−xSe species, because Cu7S4 and Cu2−xSe species are relatively stable under ambient environment conditions while the brass/Cu2S CE is extremely unstable and even bring about contamination of the polysulfide electrolyte due to the deciduous Cu2S. All results prove that our design of hollow heterostructures with double shells as competitive CE materials for QDSSCs has been achieved.

A facile in situ inward etching/sacrificial template approach has been utilized to prepare SW-Cu7S4-NBs and DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs with a uniform size of 1 um by employing Cu2O nanocubes as templates. The sequential growth of Cu2−xSe and Cu7S4 shells based on their small Ksp and etching of Cu2O templates for two cycles together contribute the construction of unique double-walled heterostructures. Accurate control of the Cu2O dissolution time during the first cycle constitutes the most pivotal factor in fabricating the structure. The QDSSC with the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE exhibits the highest PCE of 4.38%, which is better than those of SW-Cu7S4-NBs (3.97%), Pt (1.54%) and brass/Cu2S (3.43%). Firstly, the incorporated Cu2−xSe has a high intrinsic electron conductivity. Secondly, the unique double-walled hollow structure with a larger specific surface area (69.51 m2 g−1) would provide more active sites to catalyse the reduction of S2−/Sn2−, facilitate the diffusion of electrolytes and accelerate electron transport. Thirdly, DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNBs can effectively reflect incident light and thus improve light utilization. Finally, the heterostructure may combine profitable features related to internal electron transition behavior thus exhibiting enhanced optical and electro-chemical properties. What should also be noted is that the electrochemical tests have verified that the DW-Cu2−xSe/Cu7S4-HNB CE shows excellent long-term stability towards the polysulfide redox electrolyte even after 600 cycles of CV tests.
