A high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 film is crucial in the manufacture of a high-performance perovskite solar cell. Here, a recrystallization process via facile fumigation with DMF vapor has been successfully introduced to self-repair of CH3NH3PbI3 films with poor coverage and low crystallinity prepared by the commonly used one-step spin-coating method. We found that the CH3NH3PbI3 films with dendritic structures can spontaneously transform to the uniform ones with full coverage and high crystallinity by adjusting the cycles of the recrystallization process. The mesostructured perovskite solar cells based on these repaired CH3NH3PbI3 films showed reproducible optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.15% and average PCE of 10.25 ± 0.90%, which are much better than that of devices based on the non-repaired CH3NH3PbI3 films. In addition, the hysteresis phenomenon in the current–voltage test can also be effectively alleviated due to the quality of the films being improved in the optimized devices. Our work proved that the fumigation of solvent vapor can modify metal organic perovskite films such as CH3NH3PbI3. It offers a novel and attractive way to fabricate high-performance perovskite solar cells.

As next-generation photovoltaic (PV) devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic bulk heterojunction solar cells, and colloidal nanocrystal solar cells, have attracted much interest since they can be assembled with low-cost materials and cost-effective methods. As a new kind of PV device derived from DSSCs, the perovskite solar cell has recently become a rapidly rising star due to swiftly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 20.1% from 3.8%. Metal organic perovskite materials such as CH3NH3PbI3 are the most important components in the cells. Their unique features include: (1) excellent and tunable optical properties with the change in chemical composition; (2) long carrier diffusion lengths (100–1000 nm) and long lifetimes (∼100 ns) due to their large dielectric coefficients; (3) ambipolar charge transport properties; and (4) low-temperature (<100 °C) solution processability due to a self-assembly–driven phase transformation. All such features are vital for application in high-performance PV devices.

In order to employ the previous characteristics effectively in high-performance PV devices, numerous efforts have been focused on preparation of high-quality metal organic perovskite films because poor morphology and low crystallinity of the films not only cause electrical shorting but also deleteriously impact charge dissociation/transport/recombination in the devices. Most of such efforts were based on engineering the films’ nucleation and growth processes, including one-step spin-coating, sequential deposition from solution, dual-source vapor evaporation, and a vapor-assisted solution process. Among these, the one-step spin-coating is the most widely used. But it is difficult to yield a homogeneous metal organic perovskite film with uniform and full coverage in large areas. Some effective modifications to this method have been realized. For example, Cheng et al. fabricated flat and uniform CH3NH3PbI3 films by exposing the spin-coated precursor film in a second solvent or dry Ar gas stream, with results of PCE > 13%. Dense CH3NH3PbI3 films were also obtained by introducing additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane, CH3NH3Cl, and NH4Cl in the precursor solution. Recently, solvent engineering techniques were also developed to produce very uniform CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3 films by a one-step spin-coating method that enabled the fabrication of solar cells with the certified PCE of 16.2%.
Complementary to directly engineering the nucleation and growth processes in the synthesis stage of films, post-treatment of synthesized films has also been regarded as an effective way to tailor the physical and chemical properties of inorganic and organic films. In particular, it has been reported that post-synthesis treatments can induce the recrystallization of active layers of thin-film solar cells, thus significantly improving their morphology and crystallinity, as well as device performance. For example, recrystallization of CdTe films under various conditions including high temperature, mechanical pressure, and CdCl2 treatment can facilitate the growth of CdTe grains, and as a consequence device efficiency can be enhanced. The morphology improvement of CuInS2 thin films after recrystallization was also verified in previous studies. Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that solvent vapor fumigation was an effective method to promote crystallization of some special organics, such as vanadyl phthalocyanine dyes, syndiotactic polystyrene, and polycarbonate of bisphenol A, and so on. This means that recrystallization of the one-step spin-coated perovskite films by a post-synthesis treatment such as solvent vapor fumigation can modify the film morphologies and crystallinities.
In this study, a recrystallization process via facile DMF vapor fumigation has been successfully introduced to self-repair of the one-step, spin-coated CH3NH3PbI3 films with dendritic structures to the uniform ones with full coverage and high crystallinity. The mesostructured perovskite solar cells based on these repaired CH3NH3PbI3 films showed the reproducible optimal PCE of 11.15% and the average PCE of 10.25 ± 0.90%, which are much better than that of the devices based on the non-repaired CH3NH3PbI3 films. In addition, the hysteresis phenomenon in the J–V test can also be effectively alleviated due to the quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 films being improved in the optimized devices.

Hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water) and methylamine (33 wt% in absolute ethanol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, 98%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 98%), dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.5%) and lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagents. Tetrabutyl titanate, acetonitrile, chlorobenzene, diethanolamine, and isopropanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD, ≥99%) was purchased from Shenzhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (China). All of the used reagents were analytical grade, without further purification.


Patterned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates with sheet resistance of 14 Ω sq−1 were cleaned by ultrasonic washing in detergent solution, acetone, absolute alcohol, and deionized water for 20 min each in succession, and then treated by UV-ozone cleaning for 30 min. TiO2 sol was dropped onto the pre-cleaned substrates to form compact TiO2 layers of about 100 nm thickness by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30s, and followed by annealing at 450 °C for 40 min in air. TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) diluted with ethanol at 1:3.5 by weight was then dropped onto the TiO2 compact film to form a mesoporous TiO2 layer with about 400 nm thickness by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min in air.


First, CH3NH3I was synthesized according to the recipe reported by Lee et al. Then, PbI2 and CH3NH3I with a molar ratio of 1:1 were mixed in DMF and stirred at room temperature for 12 h to form the 40 wt% CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution. Next, the solution was dropped onto the mesoporous TiO2 films to prepare the sample CH3NH3PbI3 films by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 90 °C for 10 min in the dry box with relative humidity below 10%. Thus, the sample CH3NH3PbI3 films with black color were obtained. In the recrystallization process via DMF vapor fumigation, each prepared sample of CH3NH3PbI3 films was placed on top of a hot plate pre-heated at 90 °C in the dry box and carpeted with a filter paper. A portion of the 0.5 mL DMF solution was then dropped onto the filter paper, and quickly covered with a culture dish to form the DMF vapor atmosphere. The black CH3NH3PbI3 samples gradually turned pale yellow from edges toward center in about 2 s, indicating dissolution of CH3NH3PbI3 in the DMF vapor atmosphere. After being fumigated for about 10 s, they were transferred to another hot plate pre-heated at 90 °C and annealed for 10 min in dry box. The CH3NH3PbI3 films were recrystallized from the DMF vapor and the color of the samples gradually returned to black. The above recrystallization procedure was exactly controlled and continuously repeated for 2, 4, 6, and 10 cycles, and the corresponding samples were labeled as C2, C4, C6, and C10, respectively. The sample without the recrystallization treatment was also prepared and labeled as C0 for comparison. The above experimental processes for preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 films and recrystallization via DMF vapor fumigation are also schematically shown in Fig. 1.


72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 17.5 μL lithium Li-TFSI in acetonitrile (500 mg mL−1) and 28.8 μL TBP were mixed in 1 mL chlorobenzene to form the hole transport material (HTM) solution. Then, the solution was coated on the CH3NH3PbI3 samples to form the HTM layer by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s. After being preserved in the dark in dry box for 24 h, an Ag counterelectrode with about 100 nm thickness and area of 0.28 cm2 was deposited on the top HTM layer by the thermal evaporation technique. Thus, mesostructured perovskite solar cells with the configuration of FTO/compact-TiO2/mesoporous-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag were fabricated to further characterize their cell properties.


A FEI NOVA NanoSEM230 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the morphological properties of the samples. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima Ш X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα) in the range of 10°–60°. A Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-vis spectrometer fitted with an integrating sphere was used to investigate the absorption properties of the samples. The time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay property was obtained using the time-correlated single-photon counting technique (Picoharp 300). The samples were photoexcited using a laser beam pulsed at 5 MHz. The performance measurements of the fabricated solar cells were carried out on a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under AM1.5 illumination (standard 100 mW cm−2) cast by an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator calibrated by the standard reference of a Newport silicon solar cell. A black mask with a circular aperture (0.07 cm2) was applied on top of the solar cell. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source.


The morphology of the samples C0, C2, C4, and C6 was analyzed via SEM, and corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. As seen in Fig. 2(a)–(d), each of the CH3NH3PbI3 films has a unique morphology at a large scale, which benefits from the inherent characteristics of the spin-coating method and the subsequent DMF vapor fumigation. By comparison, the surface roughness of the CH3NH3PbI3 films after recrystallization is significantly decreased, which becomes more evident with increased recrystallization cycles. To further reveal the morphology details of the CH3NH3PbI3 films, high-resolution SEM images are given in Fig. 2(e)–(h). It can be seen that the CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared by the one-step spin-coating method is in the poor dendritic structure covering the mesoporous TiO2 layer, which is consistent with previous studies. As expected, the CH3NH3PbI3 films exhibit strikingly different morphologies after recrystallization. For the sample C2, the dendritic CH3NH3PbI3 structures start to widen and flatten, which is accompanied by the increase in film coverage. When the recrystallization cycle was increased to 4, the dendritic CH3NH3PbI3 structures seemed to completely disappear as a result of the formation of randomly packed CH3NH3PbI3 grains with interconnected crystalline grain networks. Yet, there were still some pinholes sparsely dispersing on the surface. By increasing the recrystallization cycle to 6, the CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibited a densely grained uniform morphology. The coverage and quality of CH3NH3PbI3 films obviously improved with the increase in recrystallization cycles. We repeated this process for 10 cycles, yet it was found that the edges of the CH3NH3PbI3 film shrunk, which exhibits distinct morphology compared to the film center, as revealed in Fig. S1. The non-uniformity may detrimentally affect the reproducibility of the ultimate PV devices, so our work was mainly focused on samples of less than 6 recrystallization cycles.

XRD measurements were conducted to investigate whether the morphology evolution would affect the crystal structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 films. As shown in Fig. 3, all samples showed major diffraction peaks of the perovskite phase of CH3NH3PbI3, which is indicated by the dominant peaks located at 14.08°, 28.40°, and 31.86°, corresponding to the (110), (220), and (310) lattice planes, respectively. Compared to sample C0, both diffraction peaks of (110) and (220) lattice planes of samples C2, C4, and C6 become higher in sequence as shown in Fig. 3(b), which reveals that both of the film crystallinity and the growth of grains (as revealed in Fig. 3(c)) can be improved with the increase of the recrystallization cycle. Moreover, the small diffraction peaks of (112), (211), and (202) planes, related to the randomly oriented CH3NH3PbI3 crystal domains, are significantly weakened for the samples C2, C4, and C6. All results imply that film crystallinity can become better after the controlled recrystallization, which is in accordance with results in Fig. 2. In addition, the characteristic peaks of PbI2 or CH3NH3I are not observed in the samples C2, C4 and C6, indicating that the possible phase separation or decomposition of the CH3NH3PbI3 films is avoided during the recrystallization process. These characters are beneficial to both the performance and the reproducibility of the ultimate PV devices.

Fig. 4 gives the UV-vis absorption spectra of the samples C0, C2, C4, and C6. All samples exhibited a panchromatic absorption of light with spectra extended over the visible to near-infrared region, which is consistent with previous studies. Impressively, the samples C2, C4, and C6 show the enhanced light harvesting in the wavelength range of 550–800 nm compared with the sample C0, which became more evident with the increase in recrystallization cycle. Such an enhancement is mainly related to the combined effects of the improved coverage and crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 films after recrystallization.
We further evaluated the effects of the coverage and the crystallinity enhancements of the CH3NH3PbI3 films on the performance of the perovskite solar cells by employed the device configuration of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells with the samples C0, C2, C4, and C6 measured under simulated AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination are presented in Fig. 5(c). It can be seen that the device with the sample C0 exhibits the short circuit current density (Jsc), the open circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and the PCE to be 12.46 mA cm−2, 0.83 V, 0.49, and 5.07%, respectively. These inferior performance characteristics can be ascribed to the poor coverage and the low crystallinity of sample C0. In contrast, for the devices that used samples C2, C4, and C6, the Jsc are 15.62, 18.43, and 20.12 mA cm−2, and corresponding PCE are 7.28%, 8.93%, and 10.16%, respectively. Clearly, the performance of the solar cells containing the CH3NH3PbI3 films after recrystallization was significantly improved, and could be optimized by adjusting recrystallization cycles (Table 1).

The photoelectric conversion characteristics of the fabricated devices were further investigated by measuring IPCE, which is defined as the number of photogenerated charge carriers contributing to the photocurrent per incident photon. As revealed in Fig. 5(d), the photocurrent generation starts at around 800 nm, in agreement with the reported band gap of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 materials (1.55 eV). All the IPCE spectra reach a maximum value at ∼500 nm, and then decrease from 600 nm, indicating a photocurrent loss due to either insufficient absorption of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer or the optical interference. The device with the sample C0 exhibited IPCE below 60%, while the devices with the samples C2, C4, and C6 showed remarkable photocurrent improvement over the entire region. In particular, the IPCE maximum could reach about 76% for the device used with sample C6. These results match the differences of Jsc values for devices with the samples C0, C2, C4, and C6.
Many factors can affect the performance of perovskite solar cells. It is always difficult to determine the exact contribution of each factor due to variable relevance and the absence of direct characterizations for some potential factors. However, it is still necessary and also desirable to follow some key points to understand the greatly enhanced PCE with the CH3NH3PbI3 films after recrystallization based on current information. Compared with the device with the sample C0, differences were observed only in the CH3NH3PbI3 layers for devices with samples C2, C4, and C6. Therefore, properties determined by modifications of the CH3NH3PbI3 films’ morphology and crystallinity can be responsible for the greatly enhanced PV properties. On the one hand, the improved coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 films after recrystallization is a vital factor. The reasons for ensuring film coverage are two-fold: first, if there are regions without CH3NH3PbI3 padding, light will directly pass through without absorption, thus decreasing the available photocurrent; second, any insufficient coverage easily results in formation of low-resistance shutting paths allowing direct contact between the HTM and mesoporous TiO2 layers. Any such path will act as a parallel resistor in the solar cell–equivalent circuit, causing drops in Voc, FF, and PCE. As exhibited in Fig. 2, compared with the sample C0, the coverage of samples C2, C4 and C6 improved with recrystallization cycle increases; therefore, enhancements of Jsc, Voc, and FF of corresponding devices followed the same trend.
On the other hand, the decrease in defects resulted from film crystallinity improvement. It has been demonstrated that reduced defects in the CH3NH3PbI3 films can facilitate the diffusion of free carriers, thus leading to enhancements of the charge transfer and separation efficiencies, which play a vital role in improving the Jsc of the devices. In the present case, both crystallinity and preferential orientation of samples C2, C4 and C6 are increased compared with sample C0, which implies the reduction of defects in the films. Therefore, the charge transfer and separation efficiencies in corresponding devices should be effectively increased, which can substantially lead to higher Jsc. To further verify this statement, we investigated the differences of charge dissociation behaviors in the prepared samples by means of time-resolved PL decay measurements, and the corresponding results are presented in Fig. 6. All curves were fitted with a two-component exponential decay function containing fast-decay and slow-decay processes. The fast-decay process is considered to be the result of the quenching of free carriers in the CH3NH3PbI3 domains through transport to TiO2, and the slow-decay process to be the result of radiative recombination. As summarized in Table 2, the lifetime values of fast decay for the samples C2, C4 and C6 decreased, and the corresponding weight fractions of fast decay increased with the increase in recrystallization cycles compared with the sample C0. These results effectively verify the enhancement of charge dissociation properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 films after recrystallization. In particular, the weight fraction related to quenching of free carriers up to 92% was noted for sample C6, indicating the extremely efficient charge transporting from the CH3NH3PbI3 domains to TiO2. Therefore, the enhanced PCE of the devices with the samples C2, C4, and C6 can be mainly attributed to enhanced light absorption, reduced shunting paths, and increased charge transfer and separation efficiencies in the devices, resulting from improved coverage and crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 films after recrystallization. In particular, for sample C6, the homogeneous, pinhole-free, and well-crystallized CH3NH3PbI3 layer was realized, so the corresponding device exhibited optimal performance.

It should be noted that the FF of all devices presented in this work was relatively low. This is perhaps a result of the HTM layer not being optimized (in terms of layer thickness, precursor solution concentration and dopant levels). In fact, very little optimization work was carried out on these devices except for the CH3NH3PbI3 layers. The work of optimizing the HTM layer is underway and it is conceivable that higher-efficiency devices can be manufactured using this recrystallization procedure.
Recently, anomalous hysteresis phenomena in J–V testing were widely observed in perovskite solar cells. Previous experimental results showed that this phenomenon is dependent on properties of the perovskite layer, p- and n-type contact materials, and device configuration. Because the devices based on samples C0, C2, C4, and C6 had the same contact materials and configurations, the differences derived only from the coverage and crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbI3 layers. Thus, it is interesting to investigate the effects of these factors on the hysteresis phenomena during J–V testing of the devices. As displayed in Fig. 7, devices with samples C0, C2, C4, and C6 showed different hysteresis behaviors. As seen in Table S1, which presents the qualitative analysis of the hysteresis phenomenon, the device with sample C0 exhibited serious hysteresis phenomena, while devices with samples C2, C4, and C6 show that hysteresis weakened with the increase in recrystallization cycles. In particular, for the sample C6–based device, the difference of J–V curves under FS and RS was extremely diminutive. These results suggest that recrystallization of the CH3NH3PbI3 films by DMF vapor fumigation can effectively alleviate the hysteresis phenomenon in J–V testing of the devices, which is beneficial to device reliability in practical applications. As seen in recent studies, the origin of the hysteresis phenomenon was ascribed to the traps, the ferroelectric properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 film and/or the ion migration induced by photo and/or electric field. Here, the alleviation of the hysteresis phenomenon in the J–V test of the devices with the samples C2, C4, and C6 indicates that the origin of this phenomenon is most likely related to the formation of traps induced by defects in the CH3NH3PbI3 films.
To further investigate the reproducibility of this recrystallization procedure in fabricating the mesostructured perovskite solar cells, we prepared 20 devices with C6 samples from four batches, and corresponding PV parameter statistics are shown in Fig. 8(a)–(d) and Table S2. The average Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE are 0.86 ± 0.05 V, 19.34 ± 1.50 mA cm−2, 0.61 ± 0.07, and 10.25 ± 0.90%, respectively. Moreover, 70% of the devices have a PCE above 10%. The excellent reproducibility can be attributed to the high uniformity of the CH3NH3PbI3 films achieved by the recrystallization procedure, which is attractive for a large scale production of the perovskite solar cells. In particular, as presented in Fig. 8(e), the optimal performing solar cell shows the Jsc of 19.42 mA cm−2, the Voc of 0.87 V, the FF of 0.66, and the PCE of 11.15%, which are comparable to that of previously reported high performance mesostructured or planar perovskite solar cells. To determined a more reliable PCE for the device, taking the hysteresis characteristics into consideration, the photocurrent was measured as a function of time at a forward bias near its maximum output power point. As exhibited in Fig. 8(f), the photocurrent density stabilized within seconds to approximately 16.08 mA cm−2, yielding stabilized PCE around 10.93%. This indicates that our test conditions (open-circuit to short-circuit under the forward bias voltage) provided a relatively accurate representation of the PV performance of the device while still resulting in a relative overestimation of the steady-state power output by about 1.7%. These results indicate that the recrystallization procedure for realizing uniform, full-coverage, and high-crystallinity CH3NH3PbI3 films with excellent reproducibility can be a facile way to fabricate high-performance perovskite solar cells.

In summary, we demonstrated that the facile DMF vapor fumigation can induce self-repair recrystallization of the one-step spin-coated CH3NH3PbI3 films with dendritic structures to the uniform ones with full coverage and high crystallinity. The mesostructured perovskite solar cells based on these repaired CH3NH3PbI3 films showed reproducible optimal PCE of 11.15% and average PCE of 10.25 ± 0.90%, which are much better than those of devices based on non-repaired CH3NH3PbI3 films. In addition, the hysteresis phenomenon in the J–V test can be effectively alleviated. Substantially enhanced PV performances can be mainly attributed to enhanced light absorption, reduced shunting paths, and increased charge transfer and separation efficiencies in the optimized devices. Our work suggests a novel and attractive way to fabricate high-performance perovskite solar cells.
