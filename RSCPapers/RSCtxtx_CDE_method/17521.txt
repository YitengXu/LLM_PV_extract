Lead halide perovskite solar cells with high efficiency have recently attracted tremendous attention. However, the poor stability of perovskite materials has hindered their practical applications. Here, we presented a hydrophobic agent, fluoroalkyl silane, to modify both the light absorbing layer and the hole transport layer. In the presence of a hydrophobic coating, we obtained a stable perovskite solar cell with less hysteresis between the forward sweep and the reverse sweep in air. The effect of fluoroalkyl silane concentration on the stability was investigated; with an optimized 2.0 wt% fluoroalkyl silane solution treatment, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells has reached over 12.0 ± 0.4%. Moreover, for those perovskite solar cells that are exposed to air with about 50% relative humidity, the efficiency was maintained at around 12% for a duration of more than 500 h, while the efficiency of those without hydrophobic coating sharply decreased from about 12% to 1% in a duration of 250 h.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered to be one of the promising next-generation solar cells due to their high efficiency, low cost, and low temperature preparation process. With the general molecular formula of ABX3 (A = CH3NH3+; NH2CH = NH2+; B = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = I−, Br−), a hybrid perovskite light absorbing layer affords several advantages, i.e. adjustable band gap, strong light absorption, ambipolar charge transport, long carrier lifetime and solution processability. In 2009, Miyasaka et al. first reported CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 as liquid junction light absorbers to replace ruthenium dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with an efficiency of 3.8%. Since 2012, Park et al. first developed solid-state perovskite solar cells using organolead trihalide compounds; the highest efficiency of PSCs has approached 22.1%, reported by KRICT. The large area perovskite solar cells have also reached over 15% recently.

Such rapid and tremendous improvement is mainly benefited from the optimization of film deposition techniques and device structural composition. It is well known that compact and uniform perovskite films are crucial for device performance, especially high crystallization. High efficiency devices have been demonstrated using sequential deposition, spin coating, vacuum evaporation, or vapor deposition, to deposit the perovskite film. Despite perovskite films being more homogeneous and indefectible through interfacial engineering, a number of key issues must be overcome before commercialization is possible. One is that the perovskite film easily degrades in the air under low relative humidity because of the hydrophilic nature of the CH3NH3+ group. Niu et al. analyzed the degradation process of perovskite, which is demonstrated as follows:
CH3NH3PbI3 (s) ⇔ PbI2 (s) + CH3NH3I (aq)
(1)
CH3NH3I (aq) ⇔ CH3NH2 (aq) + HI (aq)
(2)
4HI (aq) + O2 (g) ⇔ 2I2 (s) + 2H2O (l)
(3)
2HI (aq) ⇔ H2 (g) + I2 (s)
(4)
In air, perovskite films are eroded by moisture and oxygen. As addressed in eqn (3), oxygen reacts with HI, which accelerates the consumption of the reaction decomposition of CH3NH3I (MAI). In addition, the perovskite film can be degraded in the presence of oxygen and UV. It is reported that a humidity of 55% or above will lead to a significant decrease of the performance of solar cells with CH3NH3PbI3 due to the degradation of the light absorbing materials. Moreover, Leguy et al. have investigated the hydration mechanism of the MAPbI3 film. They found that condensed water was the main factor that caused the difference in the degradation process of MAPbI3. Initially the MAPbI3 crystal structure is associated with one water molecule to form MAPbI3·H2O. The chemical reactions in the process have been hypothesized below:
4(MA)PbI3 + 4H2O ⇔ 4(MAPbI3·H2O) ⇔ MA4PbI6·2H2O + 3PbI2 + 2H2O
(5)
When the whole film transfers into a dehydrate phase, it is likely that the excess of water results in the dissolution of CH3NH3+ and causes an irreversible degradation of the perovskite structure. Thus, the perovskite film must be prepared in controlled air with relative humidity less than 30%.
To improve the anti-humidity of perovskite films under high moisture conditions, two developments have been studied: tuning the perovskite structure and protecting the perovskite film. (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] (PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3, MA = CH3NH3) was added into the MAPbI3 composition, which changed the 3D perovskite structure into the two-dimensional (2D) perovskite analogues that appeared more resistant to humidity. Pang et al. first introduced a water-resistant organic group, NH2CHNH2, as an alternative of CH3NH3, affording relatively stable perovskite solar cells in an open space. Meanwhile, as an upper layer of perovskite films, hydrophobic hole transport materials (HTMs) have also been developed for PSCs. In the presence of oligothiophene derivatives, the solar cell efficiency was maintained at 8.8% beyond 13 days when exposed to a relative humidity of about 20% in air at room temperature without encapsulation under illumination. Han et al. modified the surface of MAPbI3 by spin-coating its precursor solution in the presence of butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride. The additives facilitate the incorporation of the perovskite cell within a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, as well as the growth of a uniform perovskite layer at the surface, enhancing the material's photovoltaic performance as well as its resistance to moisture.
In addition, Niu et al. post-modified the perovskite film using an aluminum oxide coating, affording not only increased interface resistance of the perovskite solar cells, but also protection of the perovskite film against degradation. Han and co-workers dipped with a layer of long alkyl chains (dodecyl) onto the perovskite film by self-assembly, obtaining a stable perovskite solar cell in the air. But most of these devices were prepared under an inert atmosphere and stored in air with less than 45% humidity, which remain to be improved over 50% humidity.
Herein, perovskite films were prepared in the full open space with relative humidity of about 30%. A hydrophobic coating called triethoxy-1H,1H,2H,2H-tridecafluoro-n-octylsilane (abbreviated as C13–FAS thereafter) was firstly introduced onto the perovskite films, and thus stable perovskite solar cells were obtained. As C13–FAS contains C–F bonds which are strong polar bonds, it has super-hydrophobicity compared to alkane silanes, and is widely used in anti-pollution textile fabrics, electronic products, self-cleaning glass, etc.
The derived hydrophobic coating protected perovskite films against further degradation. With the modification of C13–FAS, the perovskite devices are relatively stable in air with more than 50% humidity. In the initial stage, the performance of perovskite devices without C13–FAS modified shows no significant difference with respect to that of C13–FAS modified ones because of the domination of non-decomposed perovskite films.

Unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used as received. Spiro-MeOTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-sprobifluorene, purity ≥ 99.5%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 2-Propanol (purity ≥ 99.7%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. C13–FAS was (purity ≥ 97%) purchased from Henkel AG & Co. KGaA. The TiO2 paste (NJU-SR) was purchased from Kunshan Sunlaite New Energy Co., Ltd. CH3NH3I was synthesized according to the method described by Lee et al.


The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass (14 Ω □−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Hyogo, Japan) was sequentially washed through ultrasonic treatment in detergent, acetone, ethanol and deionized water, and treated in O2 plasma (DT-01, Suzhou Omega Machinery Electronic Technology Co., Ltd). A thin layer of compact anatase TiO2 was formed through spin-coating using an acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol on the clean substrates at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a sintering process in a furnace at 500 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 paste was spin-coated on the compact anatase TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s, where the pristine paste was diluted in ethanol (2:7, weight ratio). After drying at 120 °C for 10 min, the film was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. CH3NH3PbI3 was formed using a two-step spin-coating process. First, 400 mg PbI2 was dissolved in 1 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 70 °C. Then, PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 film at 6000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on the hotplate at 80 °C for 5 min. CH3NH3I dissolved in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) at 80 °C was loaded on the PbI2-coated substrate for 20 s (loading time), which was spun at 4000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 110 °C for 10 min. Then C13–FAS was dissolved in 2-propanol at 80 °C in the heat oven, and spun on the CH3NH3PbI3-coated substrate at 6000 rpm for 30 s. A volume of 25 μl of spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the prepared perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s. All the operation was performed in air with 30% relative humidity. Finally, a gold film of thickness 80 nm was thermally evaporated using a high vacuum deposition apparatus. The active area of perovskite devices is 0.16 cm2.


The perovskite film phase was characterized using a X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipment (Model D/max 2550V, Rigaku Co. Tokyo, Japan) under Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) irradiation. The morphology of the resultant perovskite film was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Model S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs were recorded using a Keithley model 2400 source measure unit. A solar simulator (Model 96160 Newport Co., USA) equipped with a 300 W Xenon lamp was used as a light source, where light intensity was adjusted using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with KG-1 filter for approximating AM 1.5G one sun light intensity. The cell performance parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF = Pmax/(Jsc × Voc)), and photoelectron conversion efficiency (h (%) = Jsc × Voc × FF/total incident energy × 100), were measured and calculated from the J–V characteristics. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800 nm using a specially designed IPCE system (Newport Co., USA). FTIR spectra were recorded on a NEXUS-670 (Nicolet, USA) spectrometer. The contact angles were measured on a contact angle instrument (Contact Angle System OCA40M, Dataphysics Co., Germany) at room temperature. The solar cell measurements and storage were carried outside without encapsulation.


The formation process of the hydrophobic C13–FAS chain is according to the literature. C13–FAS reacted with a small amount of water in 2-propanol, which formed Si–OH groups and left the long hydrophobic chain, as shown in eqn (6).

CF3(CF2)5CH2CH2Si(OCH3)3 + H2O → F3(CF2)5CH2CH2Si(OH)3 + CH3OH
(6)
To investigate whether C13–FAS would hydrolyze in 2-propanol, FT-IR measurements for the samples were carried out. The FT-IR spectra of C13–FAS (a), 2-propanol (b), and C13–FAS-2-propanol (c) are shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1, for bare C13–FAS, the bands of Si–O groups vibrated at 1240–1085 cm−1. After adding 2-propanol (analytical purity) into C13–FAS, the vibration bonds of 1240–1085 cm−1 disappeared, leaving only vibration bonds of 1240 cm−1, which proves that FAS had undergone hydrolysis with a small amount of water in 2-propanol, forming electrophilic Si–OH groups. After spin-coating on the perovskite substrate, the perovskite film remained as it was, which have been further proved by the XRD pattern and scanning electron microscopy (discussed later). Affirmatively, I− in CH3NH3I adsorbed the hydrolyzed C13–FAS, leaving the long C–F chain stick out from the perovskite surface.
For the preparation of perovskite films in air, the temperature of the PbI2 substrate should be similar to that of CH3NH3I solution.Fig. 2 shows the procedure for the preparation and modification of perovskite films under 30% relative humidity. As shown in Fig. 3, both of the samples are well crystallized in the experiment with large crystallite sizes (300 nm–500 nm). After post-modification, the C13–FAS chains haven't affect the morphology of the perovskite films. After storing in air with about 50% humidity for three weeks, non-modified perovskite films have decomposed mostly, while the morphology of post-modified one has changed slightly. This was further confirmed by XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 4. From the XRD patterns, well-crystallized perovskite grains were formed on the FTO glass. The signature peaks at 2θ = 14.08°, 24.52° and 28.41° were assigned to the (110), (202) and (220) lattice planes, respectively. After storing in air (about 50% humidity) for three weeks, the diffraction peaks of the non-modified perovskite film had weakened, and the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 13.2° of PbI2 in the XRD patterns were observed, indicating that perovskite grains had begun degradation within three weeks of storage time. But in the XRD patterns of post-modified perovskite films, the perovskite grain still maintained as in the initial. The result confirmed that with C13–FAS modified, the stability of perovskite film had significantly improved in air.

Two films were further assembled into solar cells. The performance of the two solar cells is presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the champion device of non-modified perovskites. The solar cell exhibits a conversion efficiency of 8.7% (Jsc = 20.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.88 V, fill factor = 0.49) from the forward sweep and 11.3% (Jsc = 20.12 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V, fill factor = 0.61) from the reverse sweep. Although high crystalline perovskite films are formed in air, the hysteresis of non-modified perovskite devices didn't eliminate completely, which is resulted from the capacitance properties of the interface between the perovskite film and hole transparent layer. Fig. 6b shows the J–V curves of the champion device of post-modified perovskites. The solar cell exhibits a conversion efficiency of 11.7% (Jsc = 21.32 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.89 V, and fill factor = 0.62) from the forward sweep and 12.4% (Jsc = 21.63 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.91 V, and fill factor = 0.63) from the reverse sweep, which proved that using post-modification passivated hysteresis completely. This result simultaneously suggested that C13–FAS didn't impact the transportation of photon-generated holes, which can be explained by the quantum tunnelling effect. Fig. 5c presents the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra. The integrated Jsc values obtained from the IPCE curve of two solar cells were 16.77 mA cm−2 (black line) and 19.31 mA cm−2 (red line), respectively. The integrated Jsc value for post-modified perovskite solar cells is reasonably close to the Jsc value obtained from the J–V measurements, while the value for non-modified perovskite solar cells is much lower than that obtained from the J–V measurements, further confirming the existence of capacitance between the interfaces. However, the C13–FAS layer didn't affect the charge separation and the transportation between the perovskite film and the hole transport layer (discussed latter).

Furthermore, the statistical data of photovoltaic parameters for two types of perovskite solar cells are plotted in Fig. 6, where the data are obtained from 14 cells or more. Most of the parameters of modified perovskite solar cells are superior to those of non-modified one. Average short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are observed from non-modified perovskite solar cells, while higher values are obtained from post-modified ones.

To further investigate the influence of the concentration of C13–FAS on the surface of perovskite films, varying concentrations of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.5% C13–FAS were tested. Corresponding contact angles (CA) of varying concentrations of C13–FAS modified perovskite films were further measured. As shown in Fig. 7, the CA increased from 62.6° to 85.5° with the concentration of C13–FAS from 0.5% to 2.5%, which suggested that more C13–FAS long chains have formed on the surface of the perovskite film with the concentration increased. Through continuous measurements of J–V, we found that with 2.0% C13–FAS treatment, the perovskite solar cells had the best stability. The reason was that with the addition of 0.5% C13–FAS, the C13–FAS didn't completely cover the perovskite solar cells, and water molecules still can attach to the perovskite surface, which resulted in the decomposition of the perovskite film. Meanwhile, perovskite solar cells had higher efficiency with 2.0% C13–FAS modified. With the increase in C13–FAS concentration, the photovoltaic holes didn't come across the C13–FAS layer, which resulted in a lower short-circuit current. And the stability of the post-modified perovskite solar cells had over 500 h. Notably, we stored the perovskite device in an ordinary atmosphere (about 50% humidity) without encapsulation.

The uniform coating of C13–FAS was further verified by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the EDS mapping images of signals from F elements measured from the surface of C13–FAS on CH3NH3PbI3/glass. To avoid interference of fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), the samples were prepared on the glass substrates with CH3NH3PbI3 layers. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), the distribution of fluorine is dispersive. Semaphore feedback from fluorine is stronger with the increase of concentration of C13–FAS, which has proved that more C13–FAS chains are attached on the perovskite film. And more C13–FAS chains protect the perovskite film from humidity in all directions.
In order to further investigate the effect of C13–FAS on electron extraction and transportation, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite films covered with varying concentrations of C13–FAS were measured. As plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI), the PL spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 on bare quartz (no quencher) shows a strong peak at ∼770 nm, irrespective of how many C13–FAS chains are attached on the surface of the perovskite film. When spiro-OmeTAD was interfaced with perovskite, the characteristic peak intensity dramatically decreased, indicating that C13–FAS did not affect the hole extraction between spiro-OmeTAD and perovskite films. It was also found that non-modified perovskite films show a slightly stronger quenching effect than all the modified ones.
The efficiency stability test results are shown in Fig. 8. The efficiency of the original device with C13–FAS modification is slightly higher than the non-modified device, which results from the promotion of Jsc. The efficiency of the original device without C13–FAS modification shows a steady decrease of the efficiency within 250 h from 12% to 1%, while the modified ones are more stable with the prolonged time, remaining 12% over 500 h.

In summary, fluoroalkyl silane (C13–FAS), has been introduced onto perovskite solar cells to prevent CH3NH3PbI3 against degradation in air by a simple spin coating method. A super-hydrophobic layer with a long C–F chain is formed at the CH3NH3PbI3/HTM interface. The advantages of C13–FAS such as the ability to decrease the device hysteresis and to enhance its hydrophobic properties have been demonstrated for the first time. Based on the hydrophobic perovskite surface, perovskite solar cells with 2.0 wt% C13–FAS post-modified had a stable efficiency of around 12% for a duration of more than 500 h in an ordinary atmosphere (about 50% humidity). We believe that better stability for perovskite solar cells can be achieved through further interface engineering of hydrophobic materials.
