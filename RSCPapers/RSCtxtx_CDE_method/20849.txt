Post-treatment of a perovskite film is known to be an efficient way to passivate surface defects in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Conventionally, post-treatment with organic iodides has been performed on the annealed perovskite phase (abbreviated as APP-PT) which, however, forms undesirable excess iodides on the surface that can generate interstitial iodine defects causing poor stability. Here, we report an efficient post-treatment process that is performed on the as-deposited un-annealed intermediate phase (abbreviated as UIP-PT). This method enables an effective passivation of the perovskite film surface with a minimal organic iodide passivation agent (100-fold reduced concentration compared with the conventional method) to prevent the surplus iodides. The trap density (nt) of the perovskite film is substantially decreased from 1.62 × 1016 cm−3 (untreated sample) to 1.24 × 1016 cm−3 after UIP-PT, while little change in nt is observed for the conventional method (nt = 1.41 × 1016 cm−3). Furthermore, negligible current–voltage hysteresis is observed in the UIP-PT sample because of the increased activation energy for ion migration. As a result of suppressed ion migration and the reduced traps, the device based on the UIP-PT demonstrates improved stability in the dark and under illumination, maintaining 96.37% of the initial PCE after 1750 h of storage.

Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have strong potential for next generation photovoltaics due to their superb photovoltaic performance. Since the first report of solid-state PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7% in 2012, a PCE as high as 25.5% was certified in 2020. Although lead halide perovskite shows inherently defect-tolerant properties, the mitigation of surface and/or bulk defects has been suggested to be crucial not only for achieving higher performance but also for improving the operational stability of the PSC devices. According to previous reports, trap sites are mainly formed at the surface of the perovskite layer and post-treatment is considered one of the efficient ways to reduce trap density. For post-treatment, the annealed perovskite films have been typically treated with a solution containing passivating agents.

Organic iodides bearing long alkyl chains or bulky organic cations such as n-butylammonium (BA), phenethylammonium (PEA), octylammonium (OA) or 1-naphthylmethylammonium (NMA) have been widely used as passivating agents for surface defects based on the post-treatment approach. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the bulky organic ammonium cations enhanced the humidity stability of PSCs. It was reported that tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) located in between the grain boundaries was also confirmed to increase the moisture-resistance, together with improved photovoltaic performance. Besides, when TBA cations were incorporated into the perovskite crystal structure, the perovskite phase could be stabilized by forming a 2D/3D mixed phase.
Despite the advantages of post-treatment with organic iodides, excess iodide ions formed on the perovskite surface can generate interstitial iodine defects. The as-formed defects are considered shallow defects which might be expected to have little effect on the initial device performance because of the aforementioned defect-tolerant properties. Nevertheless, the iodide interstitials can alter phase energetics to aggravate instability of a metastable formamidinium perovskite phase, and it can potentially migrate under illumination to degrade the operational stability of the device due to its low activation energy for migration. Therefore, an effective method for surface passivation with a minimal dose is required to prevent formation of excess iodides on the perovskite film surface.
Here, we report an effective methodology to passivate the film surface while minimizing excessive organic halide passivation agents. Dissimilar to the conventional post-treatment on an annealed perovskite film (referred to as APP-PT: annealed perovskite phase-post-treatment), we perform the post-treatment on the as-spun film with a Lewis acid–base adduct intermediate phase (referred to as UIP-PT: un-annealed intermediate phase-post-treatment). Well-known TBAI is selected as the passivating agent in order to compare the effect of post-treatment methods distinctly. The concentration of TBAI is adjusted to the condition demonstrating the best photovoltaic performance for each method (UIP-PT and APP-PT). As compared to the APP-PT, the UIP-PT approach is found to be able to reduce the optimal concentration of the passivating agent by 100 times and thus minimize the excess organic halide in the film. The effects of UIP-PT on phase composition, trap density and activation energy for ion migration of the perovskite films are investigated. The device based on the UIP-PT approach demonstrates an improved PCE of 21.28% relative to the 19.11% of the control device with enhanced operational and shelf lifetimes, maintaining 96.37% of the initial PCE after 1750 h of storage.

In Fig. 1(a) and (b), the conventional APP-PT method and the newly proposed UIP-PT method are schematically illustrated, where the TBAI dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is post-treated on the as-deposited film (Fig. 1(b)) or the annealed perovskite phase (Fig. 1(a)). The home-made FAPbI3 powder is used for the perovskite precursor solution. It should be noted that the APP-PT method is conducted after annealing, while the UIP-PT approach developed in this work is performed before annealing. It should also be noted that the UIP-PT is an energy saving process because it needs only one annealing process after post-treatment, while additional heating is required for APP-PT to remove IPA. Furthermore, the optimal concentration for post-treatment is 100 times lower for UIP-PT (0.05 mM) than for APP-PT (5.0 mM) (see Fig. 2(d) and (e)), which is beneficial for reducing residual excess iodides on the surface of perovskite grains. The plane-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Fig. 1(d)–(f) clearly show that there is no difference in surface morphology after UIP-PT with 0.05 mM TBAI, whereas a secondary phase is formed on the perovskite film surface probably due to excess TBAI and/or 2DTBA2PbI4 after APP-PT. The film thickness of about 520 nm is hardly changed by either UIP-PT or APP-PT (Fig. S1).


Fig. 2(a)–(c) show the J–V curves of the best performing PSCs with and without post-treatment. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Without post-treatment, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.11% is demonstrated with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.42 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.084 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.753 under reverse scanning conditions. After UIP-PT, the PCE is improved to 21.28% mainly due to the increase in Voc and FF to 1.121 V and 0.802 along with a slight increase in Jsc to 23.82 mA cm−2. For the conventional method of APP-PT, the PCE obtained from the reverse scan is similarly improved to 21.61% due to the improved Voc (1.122 V) and FF (0.819) despite a marginal increase in Jsc (23.52 mA cm−2). Although the reverse scanned PCE is similarly improved regardless of the post-treatment method, the J–V hysteresis is more pronounced for the APP-PT with a larger concentration of 5.0 mM TBAI as compared to the UIP-PT with a smaller concentration of 0.05 mM TBAI. The hysteresis index (HI) is estimated from [JRS × (0.8Voc) − JFS × (0.8Voc)]/JRS × (0.8Voc) (ref. 30) (or the J–V area method). The 5.0 mM TBAI-based APP-PT shows a HI = 0.0456 (or 0.1881), while the HI is as low as 0.0124 (or 0.0291) for the 0.05 mM TBAI-based UIP-PT. This indicates that a less hysteretic behavior can be induced by the UIP-PT approach. We also investigated the steady-state power outputs (SPOs) of the reference, APP-PT and UIP-PT devices in Fig. S2. Rapid decay in the first few seconds was observed for the reference and APP-PT devices, resulting in SPOs of 17.36 and 18.86% for the reference and APP-PT devices, respectively. In contrast, the SPO of the UIP-PT device slowly increases and is stabilized at 19.52%. This implies that screening effect of the built-in electric field due to defect migration is less for the UIP-PT device than for the reference and APP-PT devices, which is correlated with hysteresis phenomena. For both methods of the APP-PT and UIP-PT, dependence of photovoltaic performance on the TBAI concentration is investigated. Fig. 2(d) shows that the APP-PT-derived change in PCE is not obvious as the concentration increases to 0.1 mM but a distinct increase in PCE is observed at 0.5 mM. When UIP-PT is applied, the PCE tends to increase as the concentration increases to 0.05 mM and then decreases upon further increase in concentration (Fig. 2(e)). This implies that the UIP-PT approach is a more effective way to passivate the surface defects with a minimal dose than the APP-PT one. The concentration dependent statistical values of Jsc, Voc and FF are presented in Fig. S3. With the same concentration, the hysteresis seems to be more enhanced for APP-PT than for UIP-PT; for instance, at the same concentration of 5.0 mM, the hysteresis is more pronounced in the device fabricated by APP-PT than by UIP-PT. Considering that ion migration and/or inefficient charge extraction can cause current–voltage hysteresis, the residual excess TBAI and/or the TBA2PbI4 secondary phase formed on the surface of the perovskite film might be the possible origin of the more pronounced hysteresis in the devices fabricated by APP-PT. A slight difference in external quantum efficiency (EQE) before and after post-treatment (Fig. 2(f)) is indirect evidence of the post-treatment effect, where a change in the EQE curve shape at around 700 nm after either APP-PT or UIP-PT is indicative of modification at the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD interface.

To understand the effects of UIP-PT on structural change, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are obtained before and after post-treatment. Fig. 3(a) compares the XRD pattern for the UIP-PT with those for the APP-PT and the untreated samples. The peak at 2θ = 13.92° corresponds to α-phase FAPbI3. The estimated lattice constant of 6.357 Å for cubic FAPbI3 in the untreated film is unchanged after the APP-PT and UIP-PT. The bulk structure is expected to hardly be affected by the APP-PT because the annealed perovskite film is used for post-treatment. The bulk structure can be affected by the UIP-PT because the non-perovskite adduct intermediate phase is used. However, the UIP-PT with a small amount of TBAI is found to hardly change the bulk perovskite structure. In the low 2θ region, a peak appears at 2θ = 7.18° for APP-PT, which corresponds to the (001) peak of 2D TBA2PbI4 (see the right panel of Fig. 3(a)). The 2D phase is not detected for UIP-PT, which is probably due to the 100 times lower concentration of TBAI used for post-treatment.
To further verify the evidence of the post-treatment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is studied. All the XPS spectral peaks are calibrated to the C 1s peak (Fig. S4). The N 1s, I 3d and Pb 4f XPS spectra are depicted in Fig. 3(b)–(d). The N 1s peak observed at 400.83 eV for the reference sample is attributed to the nitrogen in the FA cation and related to the interaction between FA and I. After the 0.05 mM TBAI-based UIP-PT, this peak is slightly shifted to a lower binding energy of 400.77 eV, although the 0.06 eV change is too small to be evaluated, which indicates that the FA–I interaction is very slightly affected due to the presence of interaction between TBA and I. Upon the 5.0 mM TBAI-based APP-PT, the shift to lower binding energy (400.64 eV) is also observed because of the underlying TBA–I interaction. In addition, a new peak with a lower intensity appears at a higher binding energy of 402.61 eV for the APP-PT case, which is related to 2D TBA2PbI4 because of the different chemical environment of nitrogen in TBA. The lower intensity means that the amount of TBA found in the given unit dimension is relatively lower than that of FA. It can be concluded that the UIP-PT with a small amount of passivating agents can modify only the surface of perovskite to some extent, while the APP-PT with a larger amount of passivating agents leads to surface modification and formation of the separate 2D phase as well.
The Pb 4f XPS spectra are compared in Fig. 3(c). The peaks at 138.18 eV and 143.03 eV for the reference are attributed to the Pb 4f7/2 and the Pb 4f5/2 of the Pb–I species, respectively. These peaks are shifted to lower binding energies at 137.53 eV and 142.38 eV after APP-PT and 138.03 eV and 142.88 eV after UIP-PT. The shift toward lower binding energy underlines that the oxidation state of Pb is lowered or the electron cloud density of Pb is increased as a result of electron donation from TBAI. A relatively larger shift by the APP-PT than by UIP-PT is due to the presence of 2D TBA2PbI4, which is consistent with the XRD result. Fig. 3(d) shows the I 3d XPS spectra, where the 3d5/2 and the 3d3/2 peaks are centered at 619.23 eV and 630.68 eV for the reference sample, which are attributed to the Pb–I chemical species. The post-treatment shifts the doublet to lower binding energies at 618.58 eV and 630.08 eV for the APP-PT sample and 619.08 eV and 630.58 eV for the UIP-PT sample. The shift of I 3d peaks to lower binding energy indicates that the oxidation state of iodide is decreased or the Pb–I bond is weakened by interaction with the TBA cation. The degree of shift of the binding energy is more pronounced for the APP-PT than for the UIP-PT, which is again due to the presence of 2D TBA2PbI4.
To analyze the change of the optoelectronic properties after treatment, we perform ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, He 1a, E = 21.22 eV) and UV-Vis spectroscopy for the perovskite films treated with TBAI solutions using different processes (Fig. S5(a)–(c)). The valence band maximum (EVB) is estimated from the UPS data using the energy difference between the Fermi level (Ef) and work function (ϕ), where ϕ = 21.22 eV − Ecutoff (Ecutoff represents the cut-off energy in the higher binding energy region). To determine the Ef, we used a logarithmic scale method in the lower binding energy region. The ϕ is determined to be 4.97, 4.94 and 4.98 eV for the reference, APP-PT and UIP-PT samples, respectively, which lead to EVB values of −5.47, −5.41 and −5.44 eV which are well consistent with the values reported in previous reports.ECB is determined by using EVB and Eg, where Eg is estimated to be 1.54 eV before and after post-treatments from the Tauc plot of the absorbance data (Fig. S5(d)). The resulting energy band levels are displayed in Fig. S5(e)–(g). Since the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of electrons is less than 1 nm for UPS, the change of the band position is related to the change of the perovskite surface where the post-treatment has a dominant influence. We also performed UPS (Fig. S6(a)) and absorbance measurements (Fig. S6(b)) of the TBA2PbI4 film to obtain the energy band levels of TBA2PbI4 as shown in Fig. S6(c). The calculated EVB is −6.23 eV which is much deeper than that of the bare perovskite film. Therefore, we speculate that the UPS signals detected from the surface treated sample mainly originated from the exposed 3D perovskite (or 3D perovskite with very thin 2D passivation layers). Considering that UPS can provide information on the electronic density of states in the valence band region, the upward shift in EVB after post-treatment is indicative of an increase in electron density as a result of electron donation from TBAI as confirmed from the XPS results. As compared to the UIP-PT, the larger shift in EVB for the APP-PT is due to the 2D TBA2PbI4 formed on the surface.
Although the origin of the current–voltage hysteresis in PSCs is still under debate, capacitive current induced by iodide migration is considered one of the most probable reasons. Since activation energy (Ea) for iodide migration can affect the hysteresis, Ea is estimated from the Nernst–Einstein relationship , where σ(T) is the temperature-dependent conductivity, kB is the Boltzmann constant, σ0 is the pre-exponetial factor and T is the temperature. Measurements were performed with the device structure of FTO/perovskite/Au in the dark under vacuum (>10−2 torr) at a compliance bias of 0.1 V. Fig. 4(a) shows the temperature-dependent conductivity. The slope is relatively low at lower temperature but increases at higher temperature. The conductivity at low temperature is due to the intrinsic charge carriers, while ion conduction is predominantly involved upon increasing the temperature. The threshold temperature at which ion conduction starts to dominate is increased from 333 K to 345 K upon UIP-PT, while it is decreased to 323 K for the APP-PT sample. This indicates that ion migration is retarded by the UIP-PT. The Ea values for ion migration are calculated by fitting the measured data at relatively high temperature, which results in 0.429, 0.343 and 0.486 eV for the reference, APP-PT and UIP-PT samples, respectively. Higher Ea is observed after the UIP-PT, while APP-PT decreases the Ea. This tendency is well consistent with the degree of the HI. The decreased Ea by the APP-PT is indicative of acceleration of iodide migration, which is related to the excess iodide ions on the perovskite surface. The capacitance in the low frequency region of the capacitance–frequency data in Fig. S7 and Table S1, implying charge accumulation at the electrode interface, is estimated to be 2.53 × 10−6 F cm−2 for the UIP-PT film, which is lower than that for the reference film (1.60 × 10−5 F cm−2). However, the APP-PT film shows a higher value of 5.15 × 10−5 F cm−2, which is responsible for the increased HI.
Since the J–V performance is improved regardless of the post-treatment process, trap density is evaluated from the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) using VTFL = qntL2/2kε0, where q is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 C V−1 m−1), k is the dielectric constant of the perovskite film (45.01, 44.21 and 44.40 for the reference, the APP-PT and the UIP-PT films, respectively, which are obtained from the geometric capacitance in Fig. S7 and Table S1) and L is the thickness of the perovskite films (∼520 nm). The VTFL was obtained by linear fitting of the ohmic region (I is proportional to V, n = 1) and trap-filled limit region (I is proportional to Vn, n > 3) in the dark J–V curves. As can be seen in Fig. 4(b)–(d), the trap density is decreased from 1.62 × 1016 to 1.41 × 1016 and 1.24 × 1016 cm−3 after APP-PT and UIP-PT, respectively. Thus, UIP-PT is found to be a more effective approach than APP-PT to reduce trap density.
To further investigate the ion migration, the PL image of the perovskite film is in situ obtained under 440 nm illumination using a lateral device configuration with interdigitated gold electrodes.Fig. 5 shows the in situ PL image of the perovskite films obtained before and after applying a bias voltage of 5 V for 30 s. A bright image of the reference perovskite film (Fig. 5(a)) becomes much less bright upon applied bias (Fig. 5(d)), which indicates that PL is quenched probably due to ion migration. The bright PL image is even more seriously dimmed after applying voltage for the 5.0 mM APP-PT case (Fig. 5(b) and (e)), which is indicative of pronounced ion migration as well. However, the bright image remains almost unchanged after applying bias voltage for the 0.05 mM UIP-PT film (Fig. 5(c) and (f)). The in situ PL study clearly evidences that difference in the current–voltage hysteresis between the APP-PT and the UIP-PT originates from the more suppressed ion migration by the UIP-PT than by the APP-PT. The device stability is also tested for the devices that are kept in a dark environment at a temperature of 25 ± 5 °C and relative humidity of 30 ± 10% for more than 1750 h. Fig. 5(g) shows that the UIP-PT based device maintains 96.37% of its initial PCE, while the PCEs of the reference device and the APP-PT based device decline to a large extent for the initial 200 h, resulting in degradation by 14.17% and 21.89%, respectively. A steady state PCE is also investigated at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 3600 s without encapsulation (Fig. 5(h)). As compared to the relatively large decrease in PCE from 18.01% to 14.31% for the reference device and from 19.35% to 16.40% for the APP-PT based device, a much lower decrease in PCE from 19.44% to 18.56% is observed for the UIP-PT based device. The suppressed ion migration in the perovskite film prepared by the UIP-PT process is responsible for the significantly improved stability, which proves that the stability of PSCs is closely related to ion migration. Finally, we investigate the effect of commonly used passivating agents (n-butylammonium iodide (BAI), octylammonium iodide (OAI) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI)) to see if the UIP-PT method is universally applicable (Fig. S8). As demonstrated in Table S2, UIP-PT devices with organic passivating agents generally showed lower hysteresis indices and higher power conversion efficiencies compared to the devices based on the APP-PT method, indicating that our UIP-PT approach is universally applicable to other passivation agents.

In this work, we demonstrated that post-treatment of the as-deposited adduct intermediate phase is an efficient way to simultaneously improve the performance and stability of the PSCs. We revealed that the conventional post-treatment approach (APP-PT) forms excessive organic iodides on the surface of perovskite films and induces interstitial iodine defects and 2D perovskite causes current–voltage hysteresis and poor stability of the PSCs. The UIP-PT approach developed in this study enables effective passivation of the perovskite film surface with a minimal amount of the organic iodide passivation agent to prevent formation of excessive iodides. Based on the UIP-PT, the optimal concentration of the solution used for surface passivation was reduced by 100-fold compared to APP-PT to achieve the improved PCE of 21.28% relative to the 19.11% of the control device. Furthermore, minimizing surplus organic iodides with the UIP-PT approach reduced the hysteresis and substantially the improved device stability under dark and operating conditions where 96.37% of the initial PCE was retained after 1750 h of storage. This work highlights the importance of a surface passivation methodology to simultaneously improve the performance and operational stability of the PSCs.


The HC(NH2)2I (FAI) powder was synthesized by reacting 30 mL of HI (57 wt% diluted in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) and 15 g of formamidinium acetate (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) with continuous stirring in an ice bath. After 30 min of stirring, the precipitates were collected by using a rotary evaporator at 70 °C. The collected precipitates were washed with diethyl ether (anhydrous, ≥99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) three times and dried in a vacuum chamber for 24 h. MACl was synthesized in an analogous way by reacting 20 mL of HCl (37 wt% diluted in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) and 27.5 mL of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI). The delta phase FAPbI3 powder was synthesized by a method described in a previous report.


Fluorine doped tin oxide glass (FTO, T18VU70, 12–13 Ω sq−1, AGC Fabritech Co., Ltd.) was cleaned by successive sonication in detergent, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min. For an electron transport layer, a 4 wt% SnO2 precursor solution was prepared by diluting a commercially available SnO2 colloidal solution (15 wt%, Alfa Aesar) in deionized water. The solution was spin-coated on the FTO substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s after UV-ozone (UV) treatment of the cleaned substrate for 30 min, followed by annealing at 185 °C for 30 min. The 1.4 M of FAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by mixing 889 mg of FAPbI3 and 22 mg of MACl in an 8:1 mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich). 15 μL of perovskite solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 20 s. During the second step, 1 mL of diethyl ether was dropped on the spinning substrate after 15 s to form an intermediate phase film. For the un-annealed intermediate phase post-treatment (UIP-PT), 40 μL of a tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) in 2-propanol (IPA, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (0.1 mM to 10.0 mM) was coated on the intermediate phase film by a dynamic spin-coating method at 5000 rpm for 30 s. After the spin-coating process, the film was annealed at 150 °C on a hot plate for 10 min. For the conventional post-treatment (APP-PT), the annealed perovskite film was treated with 40 μL of a TBAI in IPA solution (0.1 mM to 10.0 mM) by dynamic spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 80 °C for 5 min. For fabrication of the TBA2PbI4 film, 0.2 mmol TBAI and 0.1 mmol PbI2 were dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO. The solution was coated on the substrate at a spin speed of 5000 rpm for 20 s. During the spin-coating, 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was dropped after 10 s, and the coated film was annealed at 80 °C for 5 min. For a hole transport layer, a spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD (99%, Merck), 28.8 μL of t-BP (4-tert-butylpyridine, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI (bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt, 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich) in an acetonitrile (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (520 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). The spiro-MeOTAD solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation on the spiro-MeOTAD layer.


Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) generated using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6280 NS). The light intensity was adjusted using a NREL calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-2 filter. The device was covered with a metal aperture with an active area of 0.125 cm2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Rigaku Smart Lab diffractometer, where Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) was used. The scan rate and step size were adjusted to 4° min−1 and 0.02°, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a customized EQE system (PV Measurement Inc.) with a 75 W Xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) as a source for generating a monochromatic beam. Thermal conductivity was characterized with a vacuum probe station equipped with a Keithley 4200 source meter.
