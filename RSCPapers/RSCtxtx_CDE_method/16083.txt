An electron-transporting layer (ETL) with improved charge extraction-transfer kinetics and a perovskite film with improved quality highly determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, various alkali chlorides (MCl, M = Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) are employed as passivators to simultaneously modulate the electronic properties of the underlying SnO2 ETL and to regulate the quality of the upper all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite film. The primary results demonstrate that the detrimental oxygen vacancies at the SnO2 surface and under-coordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite film are counterbalanced by alkali chlorides, benefiting the PCE promotion of the carbon electrode based CsPbBr3 PSC. Because of the accelerated charge extraction, the reduced defects and the suppressed nonradiative recombination, the best device free of encapsulation tailored by the SnO2–RbCl ETL achieves a champion PCE as high as 10.04% with improved long-term stability under 80% relative humidity over 15 days, which is much higher than the 7.88% for the reference device. The proposed strategy demonstrates great promise for the development of highly-efficient PSCs with a defect engineering related concept.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to certified 25.5% from their initial 3.8% in 2009 by fabricating an n–i–p sandwiched construct owing to their superior optoelectronic properties including an ideal band gap, low trap density and high light absorption coefficient. Although the PCE is close to the theoretical value and comparable to that of mainstream-commercial silicon solar cells, the easy phase decomposition of photoactive perovskite materials when exposed to harsh conditions such as high humidity and temperature is still one obstacle towards their practical application. Fortunately, this dilemma can be effectively resolved by replacing organic cations with inorganic Cs+ to form all-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I or mixed) perovskites to trade off efficiency and stability. So far, over 20% efficiency for all-inorganic PSCs based on narrow band gap CsPbI3 films has been achieved. Nevertheless, spontaneous transformation from a black phase to a yellow phase is still a problem within iodine containing perovskite materials, which will in turn reduce the performances of related solar cells.

In contrast, tri-brominated cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) perovskites display excellent tolerance to humidity, illumination, heat and oxygen, thereby demonstrating a promising use in photoelectric devices. Unfortunately, the corresponding PCEs of CsPbBr3 PSCs are relatively lower in comparison to those of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs owing to their large optical band gap of ∼2.3 eV (in other words, narrow spectral absorption) and inevitable recombination loss at interfaces and grain boundaries upon assembling into solar cells. Consequently, many strategies have been launched to minimize charge recombination, such as improving the film quality and passivating defects to boost the photoelectric performance. As a result, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs with PCEs over 10% have been obtained under standard solar illumination conditions. Apart from the perovskite layer, in a typical PSC, the electron-transporting layer (ETL) and hole-transporting layer (HTL) are another two functional layers which determine the charge recombination behavior, especially in the interface region. In comparison to the preferred TiO2 electron-transporting material, SnO2 provides remarkable electron mobility (240 cm2 V−1 s−1), and more comparable energy-level distribution with the perovskite layer, and requires low-temperature processing technology. Therefore, the SnO2 ETL has been widely used in high-efficiency PSC devices. However, the presence of intrinsic oxygen-vacancy-related point defects located on the surface of a low-temperature processed SnO2 ETL will result in serious shunting current loss. Besides, the poor wettability of state-of-the-art SnO2 films towards perovskite precursors will further hinder the heterogeneous nucleation of the perovskite and increase the interface strain on the SnO2 film surface, against the formation of compact and pinhole-free perovskite films. Therefore, engineering the properties of SnO2 ETL films is important to enhance the PCE of CsPbBr3 PSCs.
According to previous studies, alkali metal and chloride ions can regulate perovskite film growth and passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ ions, resulting in efficiency improvement. In this work, alkali chlorides (MCl, M = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) are used to regulate the electronic properties of the underlying SnO2 ETL to enhance the efficiency of all-inorganic, hole-free CsPbBr3 PSCs. By manipulating the doping amount and alkali metal ion, an improved PCE of 10.04% from 7.88% has been achieved with a RbCl tailored SnO2 ETL, which is one cutting-edge value in this kind of PSC (the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of state-of-the-art PSCs are summarized in Table S1). After detailed characterization, the mechanism behind PCE enhancement was found to mainly originate from the simultaneous defect passivation to SnO2 and perovskite film (or the interface), enlarged grain size of the CsPbBr3 film and decreased work function of the SnO2 film. As a result, the favorable band alignment at the heterojunction improves charge extraction and therefore suppresses nonradiative recombination, which is beneficial for the maximized solar-to-electrical conversion efficiency. Moreover, the unencapsulated PSC device demonstrates a slightly improved stability under 80% relative humidity (RH) under air conditions over 15 days in comparison to the control device, showing a positive effect of alkaline chlorides as effective defect regulators.

Lithium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, methanol, ethanol, acetone, lead bromide (PbBr2) and cesium bromide (CsBr) were purchased from Aladdin. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), thiourea (CH4N2S), rubidium chloride, and cesium chloride were purchased from Macklin. Stannous chloride was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO, OPV-FT022-7) glass was purchased from OPV Tech Co. Ltd. All the materials were used without further treatment.


1.706 g SnCl2 and 0.676 g CH4N2S were firstly dissolved in 60 mL deionized water at room temperature and, then, a yellow liquid containing SnO2 QDs was obtained after continuous agitation for 36 h. The as-prepared solution was then centrifuged at 9000 rpm and filtered with a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoro ethylene filter to obtain a yellow transparent SnO2 QDs solution. Afterward, certain amounts of alkali chlorides were added into 5 mL SnO2 QD solution to yield SnO2–LiCl (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 mmol), SnO2–NaCl (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 mmol), SnO2–KCl (0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 mmol), SnO2–RbCl (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.07 mmol) and SnO2–CsCl (0.02, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 mmol) solutions, respectively.


All processes were conducted under an air atmosphere. A patterned FTO substrate was firstly etched with 2 M HCl solution and Zn powders, and then washed thoroughly with a detergent, deionized water, isopropanol and ethanol. Before the deposition of SnO2–MCl solution, the FTO substrates were pre-treated with plasma for 5 min in an O2 atmosphere. Next, the SnO2–MCl film was then fabricated on the FTO surface by spin-coating the as-prepared QD solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s and the SnO2 film was further annealed in air at 200 °C for 1 h. Afterward, an inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite film was fabricated on the surface of the FTO/SnO2–MCl substrate. In detail, 1 M PbBr2 DMF solution was spin-coated onto the SnO2–MCl layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s at 90 °C. After annealing at 90 °C for 0.5 h, 0.07 M CsBr methanol solution was spin-coated on the surface of the FTO/SnO2–MCl/PbBr2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 250 °C for 10 min. The CsBr deposition process was repeated several times to prepare the inorganic CsPbBr3 film. Finally, a carbon electrode with an active area of 0.09 cm2 was covered onto the CsPbBr3 perovskite film surface by a doctor-blade coating method.


The film morphology was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S4800, Hitachi). The crystalline structure of the material was characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation, in which the scan interval is 0.01°. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization was performed on a Bruker ICON2-SYS with a characterization error of 0.256 nm. The binding energy spectra were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with a precision of 0.05 eV. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were obtained uisng a spectrophotometer (Meipuda, UV-5600). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were conducted with a fluorescence spectrometer (FluoroMax-4), and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay curves were measured using a Horiba spectrofluorometer under a laser excitation source at a wavelength of 500 nm. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained with a scan interval of 10 nm by using an integrated system purchased from Enli Technology Co., Ltd. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were characterized using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class 3A, 91195A) under air mass (AM) 1.5G simulated solar illumination at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 with an interval of 0.001 V.


As described in the Experimental section, alkali chlorides are added into the SnO2 dispersion before annealing at 200 °C. By characterizing the crystal phase of SnO2–MCl films (see Fig, S1), it was found that the three characteristic diffraction peaks centered at 26.5°, 33.6° and 37.7° correspond to the (110), (101) and (200) planes of the SnO2 crystal (PDF#46-1088), respectively. After close observation, the characteristic peaks were found to have shifted to lower angles upon doping MCl into the films after annealing treatment, demonstrating the diffusion of MCl into the SnO2 lattice. Owing to the small amount, there are no detectable peaks related to MCl. To understand the effect of alkali chlorides on the film quality of the subsequent CsPbBr3 film, the SEM images of perovskite CsPbBr3 films have been obtained and are shown in Fig. 1a. Both films with and without MCl exhibit similar morphologies with closely-packed crystalline grains and no detrimental pores are observed over the scan area, which are advantageous for reducing charge shunting loss when assembling into solar cells. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 1b, the vertically distributed monolayer grains benefit the rapid charge transfer and the reduction of unwanted charge recombination at the grain boundaries. Compared to the CsPbBr3 film tailored by the pristine SnO2 film, larger grains are formed upon introductiong of the alkali chlorides into the underlying SnO2 ETL (Fig. 1c and S2). Particularly, it is evident from the grain size distributions of the perovskite films that RbCl treated SnO2 increases the average grain size of the CsPbBr3 film up to 1347 nm from 887 nm for the control film. When the annealing treatment temperature of the SnO2–RbCl film was further increased to 250 °C and 300 °C, the average grain sizes of CsPbBr3 perovskite films were 1312 and 1306 nm, as shown in Fig. S3, demonstrating no obvious coarsening effect with the increase in temperature. To explore the reason behind improved perovskite film quality, we have characterized the contact angles of perovskite precursor solution on the pristne SnO2 and SnO2–RbCl surfaces. As shown in Fig. 1d, the contact angle is reduced from ∼46° to ∼16°, which is beneficial for promoted heterogeneous nucleation. The corresponding root mean square (RMS) values of various ETLs from AFM characterization were determined to be 37.3, 33.9, 33.5, 32.4, 30.5, and 34.8 nm with an error of 0.256 nm for pristine, LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl and CsCl treated SnO2 ETLs (Fig. 1e), respectively, which is consistent with the improved wettability.

XRD patterns are further characterized to explore the effect of MCl on the CsPbBr3 crystal phase, as shown in Fig. 2a and S4. The reduced full width at half-maximum (Fig. S5) confirms the improved perovskite film quality. There is an interesting phenomenon that in the alkali chloride modified samples, the characteristic peaks centered at 15.2° (100), 21.5° (110) and 30.8° (200) show a slight shift to lower 2θ values with no peaks for the impurity phase, an indicator of lattice expansion. Considering that alkali metal cations and Cl ions can regulate lattice disorder and optimize grain growth kinetics through the formation of stronger bonds with Pb2+ due to the electronegativity difference, we have obtained EDS mapping images to demonstrate the presence of MCl in the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 2b, we have chosen the RbCl tailored CsPbBr3 film as a sample and the signal of Rb and Cl element is obvious, demonstrating the presence of Rb+ and Cl− in perovskite film. Therefore, together with the shifted XRD peaks, the MCl in the SnO2 film is diffused into the CsPbBr3 film during the growth process, leading to the interstitial occupation of alkaline cations within the perovskite crystal lattice owing to their smaller radius of Li+ (0.76 Å), Na+ (1.02 Å), K+ (1.38 Å), and Rb+ (1.52 Å) compared to Cs+ (1.67 Å). A preliminary conclusion can be predicted that employing alkali chlorides to regulate the perovskite quality is an effective strategy.
The perovskite film with compact boundaries will lower the defect state density, significantly enhancing the photovoltaic performances. Subsequently, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs were fabricated to explore the relationship between alkali chloride and photovoltaic performance. The inset in Fig. 2c shows the device structure with FTO/SnO2–MCl/CsPbBr3/Carbon. Devices with various doping amounts of alkali chloride were also fabricated and carefully studied as controls (Fig. S6). Combined with performance evolution, the final concentrations of alkali chlorides in the optimized ETLs were determined to be 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.04 and 0.04 mmol for LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl and CsCl, respectively. Upon doping a much higher dosage of MCl into the SnO2 film, the series resistance (Rs) in the PSC is increased (Fig. S7), leading to a decline in performance. Fig. 2c displays the J–V curves of optimal devices with various MCl additives under one standard solar irradiation and the detailed photovoltaic parameters including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table 1. The reference PSC presents a PCE of 7.88%, Voc of 1.479 V, Jsc of 7.25 mA cm−2, and FF of 73.6%. After incorporating MCl additives into SnO2 films, we can observe that the photovoltaic performance is enhanced. As a result, a peak PCE of 10.04% for a RbCl modified PSC with a Voc of 1.601 V, Jsc of 7.69 mA cm−2, and FF of 81.6% is achieved. To confirm the efficiency enhancement, the statistical PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF from 10 individual devices are determined as shown in Fig. 2d, and the prominent contribution toward efficiency the increased Voc from 1.479 V to 1.601 V and Jsc from 7.25 mA cm−2 to 7.69 mA cm−2 following the order of RbCl > KCl > LiCl > NaCl > CsCl. To ensure the validity of the above-mentioned conclusion, the IPCE spectra of pristine and champion devices are shown in Fig. 2e, demonstrating the comparable integrated current densities of 6.50 and 7.12 mA cm−2 with J–V curves, which can be further cross-checked using the steady power output (Fig. S8).

Together with the PCE improvement, the interaction mechanism between the MCl doped SnO2 ETL and CsPbBr3 perovskite film can be schematically illustrated in Fig. 3a, in which M and Cl ions diffuse from the underlying ETL to the upper perovskite film during the growth process, leading to the simultaneous passivation of oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 film and under-coordinated Pb2+ in the CsPbBr3 film. For the SnO2 film, as shown in Fig. 3b, XPS spectra are obtained to study the interaction between the SnO2 film and RbCl (the existence of RbCl in the composition layer is also confirmed by the corresponding spectra of Rb 3d and Cl 2p in Fig. S9). Obviously, two sharp peaks centered at 495.5 and 487.1 eV mainly originated from Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2, and the higher binding energies compared to the stoichiometric sample (Sn 3d3/2 at 495.0 eV and Sn 3d5/2 at 486.6 eV) demonstrate the electron-deficient feature and the existence of oxygen vacancies, which will result in the increased work function. Actually, based on our characterization, the MCl treatment can make the SnO2 more n-type, which will be discussed in the following part (see the energy level of SnO2 in Fig. 4a). Upon modification with RbCl, two peaks shift to lower binding energies of 495.1 and 486.8 eV, which is close to the values in the stoichiometric SnO2 crystal. This phenomenon is attributed to the neutralization of oxygen vacancies by induced negative Cl ions surrounding Sn atoms, reducing the recombination centers during charge transfer. Furthermore, Cl and Rb signals are also observed in the CsPbBr3 perovskite film formed on this ETL layer from the XPS spectra (Fig. S10), confirming the presence of RbCl in the perovskite lattice, which is consistent with the EDS mapping images (Fig. 2b). Taking the strong electronic coupling and higher formation energy of defects (such as under-coordinated Pb2+) induced by Cl ions and alkaline metal cations into consideration, as shown in Fig. 3c, the incorporation of RbCl into the lattice will cause the binding energy of Pb 4f to shift up 0.3 eV and, therefore, the defects are also suppressed in the CsPbBr3 film. To quantitatively estimate the defect density (ntrap) in the optimal CsPbBr3 film, the space charge-limited current (SCLC) curves have been recorded for the electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/ETL/CsPbBr3/PCBM/C and the data have been presented in Fig. 3d. After calculations according to the following formulantrap = 2εε0VTFL/qL2, where VTFL represents the trap-filled limit voltage and is obtained from the intersection of tangent lines in Fig. 3d, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, q represents the elementary electric charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant of CsPbBr3 (≈15) and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, it was found that ntrap slightly decreased from 4.48 × 1012 cm−3 for the reference to 1.44 × 1012 cm−3 for the optimal CsPbBr3 layer with the SnO2–RbCl ETL.
Originating from the reduced defects, another crucial factor that promotes efficiency is the boosted charge extraction and transfer behaviors. As discussed above, the removal of oxygen vacancies will lead to SnO2 being more n-type. Therefore, we have investigated the evolution of energy levels of the ETL after incorporating alkali chlorides by recording the UPS spectra combined with UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S11). The cutoff binding energy (Ecut-off) and Fermi edge (EF) of the pristine SnO2 film were determined to be 17.37 eV and 4.22 eV. In contrast, the Ecut-off values become 17.69, 17.61, 17.53, 17.80, and 17.50 eV for LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl and CsCl doped SnO2 ETLs, while EF values were determined to be 4.37, 4.30, 4.14, 4.35, and 4.35 eV, respectively. Therefore, the work function (W) values are −3.83, −3.51, −3.59, −3.67, −3.40, and −3.70 eV for SnO2 and SnO2–MCl films estimated by the equation: W = Ecut-off − 21.2 eV. By applying the formula of EVB = W – EF, the valence band maximum (EVB) was determined to be −8.05 eV for the SnO2 film and −7.88, −7.89, −7.81, −7.75 and −8.05 eV for the SnO2–MCl (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) film, respectively. Combined with the band gaps in Fig. S11, the conduction band minimum (ECB) values were determined to be −3.97, −3.81, −3.82, −3.74, −3.68, and −3.98 eV for pristine SnO2 and SnO2–MCl (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) films, respectively. The ECB value of CsPbBr3 is about −3.30 eV. As summarized in Fig. 4a, the MCl can decrease the work function of SnO2 for a reduced energy barrier at the ETL/perovskite interface, leading to efficient electron extraction.
To clarify the charge recombination process in the CsPbBr3 film and the ETL/CsPbBr3 interface, the steady-state PL spectra (Fig. 4b) and TRPL decay spectra (Fig. 4c) were analyzed by means of comparing the pristine and SnO2–RbCl ETL tailored CsPbBr3 films. Generally, the photogenerated charges including electrons and holes will neutralize within the perovskite film in the absence of charge selective layers, along with the strong PL intensity. In this manner, as shown in Fig. 4b, the increased PL intensity for the SnO2–RbCl/CsPbBr3 film demonstrates reduced defects and suppressed non-radiative recombination. In addition, the carrier lifetime can be determined from the TRPL decay curves with the following function:I = A1e(−t/τ1) + A2e(−t/τ2), where fast decay (τ1) ascribes to electron extraction by the ETL and the slow decay (τ2) is associated with recombination in the bulk perovskite film. Meanwhile, the average carrier lifetime (τavg) can be obtained using the following formula:τavg = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2). To minimize the characterization errors, we have made a statistical analysis as shown in Fig. 4c. The decrease in fast decay lifetime τ1 from 1.48 ± 0.07 ns to 1.27 ± 0.05 ns indicates faster electron transfer from the perovskite to ETL in the presence of the RbCl additive, agreeing well with the reduced interfacial energy barrier. The lifetime τ2 and average lifetime τavg of the perovskite film deposited on SnO2–RbCl are increased from 4.61 ± 0.72 ns to 6.67 ± 0.14 ns and 1.40 ± 0.05 ns to 2.15 ± 0.11 ns, respectively, an indicator of the slower recombination rate in the bulk of the perovskite film grown on SnO2–RbCl.
The relationship between device photovoltaic performances and charge recombination kinetics was studied by obtaining the curves of Jsc and Vocversus light intensity (I) for SnO2 and SnO2–RbCl ETL tailored all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs, and the curves are provided in Fig. 4d and e. Based on the formula: Jsc ∝ Iα, where α is determined by the bimolecular recombination, an α value close to 1.0 indicates the boosted charge extraction and/or suppressed radiative recombination. Therefore, an increased α from 0.947 ± 0.012 to 0.964 ± 0.013 upon incorporating RbCl into the device indicates reduced radiative recombination and improved electron–hole pair separation due to a more suitable energy level at the SnO2–RbCl/perovskite interface. In addition, according to the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination mechanism and the following equation:Voc = nkTln(I)/e + constant, in which k is the Boltzmann constant, T represents the absolute temperature, e refers to the elementary charge, n is an ideal factor associated with monomolecular recombination. As presented in Fig. 4e, the slope is estimated to be (2.22 ± 0.15) kT/e for the reference device, but decreased to (1.78 ± 0.13) kT/e for the device modified with the SnO2–RbCl ETL. Thus, the detrimental defect induced recombination is suppressed due to the reduced oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 film and uncoordinated Pb2+ in the CsPbBr3 film. All the results demonstrate the positive effect of incorporating RbCl into the underlying ETL to suppress charge recombination and improve PSC performance.
Outstanding efficiency and long-term stability are equally important in promoting the commercial application of all-inorganic PSCs. As is well known, the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs possess high tolerance to persistent moisture because of the stable perovskite lattice and the hydrophobicity of the carbon electrode. The normalized PCEs of inorganic PSCs with an FTO/SnO2 or (SnO2–RbCl)/CsPbBr3/carbon structure upon persistent attack by 80% humidity at 25 °C are presented in Fig. 5. The unencapsulated devices based on SnO2 and SnO2–RbCl ETLs can maintain 62% and 88% of the initial PCEs over 15 day storage, respectively. The enhanced stability for the RbCl tailored device can be attributed to the improved CsPbBr3 film quality and reduced defects.

In summary, alkali chlorides have been successfully doped in the SnO2 ETL to regulate the charge extraction and transfer ability of the perovskite film. After systematical characterization, it was found that the alkali chlorides can simultaneously passivate defects including oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 film and uncoordinated Pb2+ in the CsPbBr3 film, optimize energy-level alignment at the ETL/perovskite interface and enlarge the grain size of the upper CsPbBr3 film, leading to suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the SnO2–RbCl ETL tailored CsPbBr3 PSC achieves an enhanced PCE of 10.04% with a Voc of 1.601 V, which is much higher than that of a SnO2 ETL tailored CsPbBr3 PSC with 7.88% and 1.479 V. Moreover, the unencapsulated device with the SnO2–RbCl ETL presents improved long-term stability under persistent attack by ambient air with 80% RH at 25 °C. This strategy is promising for interface and boundary modification for high-efficiency and stable CsPbBr3 PSCs.
