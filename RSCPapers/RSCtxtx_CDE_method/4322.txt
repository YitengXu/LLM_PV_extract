Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been materialized as a hotspot in the next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their low-cost manufacturing process and high-efficiency characteristics. However, the defects within the bulk or in the grain boundaries and surface hinder ambipolar charge transport as non-radiative recombination centers. Efficacious defect passivation is therefore highly desired for high-efficiency and stable PSCs. Herein, a feasible Lewis acid/base passivation strategy and its effects on energy level alignment, recombination kinetics, hysteresis behavior and operational stability for efficient PSCs are comprehensively reviewed. These additives have been widely used to coordinate with unwanted defects and form Lewis adducts by dative bonds, where the Lewis acid contributes to passivate negatively charged defects (e.g., under-coordinated I− ions and Pb–I anti-sites) and the Lewis base plays a significant role in passivating positively charged defects (e.g., under-coordinated Pb2+ and Pb2+ interstitials), whereas zwitterions could passivate negatively and positively charged defects simultaneously. This highly executable Lewis adduct passivation would enable scalable deposition techniques for efficient and stable PSCs like inkjet printing, doctor-blade coating, screen printing, laser pattering and roll-to-roll deposition. Additionally, we also discuss the prospects of the maturity of this passivation strategy towards upscaling manufacture of perovskite photovoltaic and related optoelectronic devices.

Nowadays, ecological damage and environmental deterioration are increasing rapidly with the massive use of fossil resources and increasing energy demands. Using clean and renewable energy is a feasible measure to meet the energy balance of demand and supply. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) for hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed from the original 3.8% to the current 25.2% in the past few years. Such excellent performance arises from the high absorption coefficient, superior ambipolar-transport, long diffusion length, outstanding carrier mobility, and flexible band-gap adjustment of perovskite semiconductors. Undeniably, PSCs are expected to be an ambitious contender to silicon-based and other inorganic semiconductors in the future photovoltaic market. In spite of all these merits of PSCs, the commercialization process still faces stringent challenges on account of the formation of defects, which limits the efficiency and long-term stability.

Defects in perovskites have been one of the major obstacles that not only induce carrier recombination loss, but also result in non-negligible current–voltage (J–V) hysteresis in PSCs. Therefore, judicious defect passivation in the structural framework is highly needed to achieve high-performance PSCs. Recently, some reviews have been reported to retrospect defect passivation theories and strategies in high-efficiency PSCs. In general, defects derived from grain boundaries (GBs) and surfaces attract more attention than those derived from the bulk, where a mass of localized surface states arises due to related tension, known as dangling bonds. Various strategies such as additive engineering via controlled crystallization growth, film formation by using organic small molecules, fullerene and its derivatives, and self-formed defect healing approach have been exploited for the defect management and phase stability in PSCs. Lewis acids/bases or zwitterions have been widely investigated for defect passivation recently. For example, some Lewis bases with various functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, amino and sulfonic groups) have been reported to passivate or neutralize defects in PSCs. Lead halide compounds (e.g., PbI2, PbCl2 and Pb(SCN)2) are often incorporated to improve the grain size and crystallinity and suppress non-radiative interfacial recombination. Outstanding performance in terms of both environmental stability and optoelectronic properties was demonstrated by Yang et al. via employing a long chain cross-linking polymer template, which restrained the unwanted structural defects at grain interiors and boundaries. The recent advances and key challenges underlying the charge defect passivation in Lewis acids/bases or zwitterions have rarely been reviewed.
Herein, we review the recent progress in Lewis acid/base and zwitterion passivation to achieve high-performance PSCs. The origin and different types of defects in halide perovskites are first discussed. Beyond the conceptual understanding of perovskite defects, we then discuss the Lewis acid/base approach for defect engineering in PSCs from three aspects: Lewis acids, Lewis bases and zwitterions. These functional molecules not only enable the defect passivation but also alter the morphological evolution and crystallization kinetics of perovskite films. The passivation effects on band energy level alignment, recombination dynamics, J–V hysteresis and stability are further illustrated. Finally, a perspective on future developments in defect passivation using this approach in perovskite photovoltaic and related optoelectronic devices is also presented.

Halide perovskites adopt a general formula AMX3, where A is a monovalent cation, such as organic CH3NH3+ (MA+), HC(NH2)2+ (FA+), or inorganic Cs+, M is a divalent cation such as Pb2+, Sn2+ or Ge2+, and X is a halogen anion (I−, Br− or Cl−). In the ideal framework of perovskites, every atom should be located on a stipulated site and there should be no defects or impurities (Fig. 1a), which is called the α phase (Pmm symmetry), where Goldschmidt's defect tolerance factor (t) is equal to one. However, some external factors (e.g. moisture, oxidation, thermal stress and light illumination) and internal factors (e.g. diverse crystal structure and ion migration) have been found to induce defects, thus influencing carrier transport and recombination, energy-level alignment,J–V hysteresis, and long-term stability of PSCs. Large or small A atoms would cause deviation from the three-dimensional (3D) structure with separated B atoms, leading to octahedral sharing in the edges. X atoms affect phase segregation; conceptually, appropriate I/Br ratios (below 20–30% Br atoms) could reduce electron–phonon coupling, ionic mobility and/or carrier lifetime as well as mitigate defects. Meanwhile, the corresponding crystal structures of halide perovskites deviate to the β or γ phase (I4/mcm symmetry or Pbnm symmetry) with halogen atoms moving away from the ideal sites while A and M atoms remain in their initial positions.

Theoretical calculations have verified that intrinsic point defects, including vacancies (MA vacancies (VMA), I vacancies (VI) and Pb vacancies (VPb)), interstitials (I interstitials (Ii) and MA interstitials (MAi)), and anti-site substitutions (MA-on-Pb substitutions (MAPb), Pb-on-MA substitutions (PbMA), and MA-on-I substitutions (MAI)), have very shallow transition energy levels near the band edges, which usually happen in MAPbI3 perovskites with low formation energies. Meanwhile, deep-level defects, such as I-on-MA substitutions (IMA), Pb-on-I substitutions (PbI), I-on-Pb substitutions (IPb) and Pb interstitials (Pbi), have high formation energies, which are responsible for non-radiative recombination centers in perovskite films under either Pb-poor (I-rich) or Pb-rich (I-poor) conditions (Fig. 1a and b). Therein, MAPbI3 perovskite exhibits ample defect physics with dominant point defects. Agiorgousis et al. pointed out that further optimization of the deep-level defects needs to focus on the equilibrium carrier concentrations through around 0.3 eV Fermi energy shift away from the band edge. In the calculated lifetime pattern by Shockley–Read–Hall theory, VI under Pb-rich conditions and IMA under Pb-poor conditions played primary limitation of photoluminescence lifetime on the defect thermodynamics (Fig. 1c). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 1d, MAPbI3 exhibits flexible adjustment of n-type or p-type characteristics via changing the chemical potentials. The superior defect tolerance properties of AMX3 perovskites have been ascribed to the strong coupling of Pb lone-pair s orbital and I p orbital (s–p coupling), as confirmed in other solar cells.

Generally, a Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor which can accept a foreign electron pair, while a Lewis base is an electron-pair donor which can give an electron pair to molecules, ions, cations and atomic groups. Some Lewis base solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), can coordinate with Pb(II) halides, efficiently controlling grain sizes and perovskite morphology. However, these solvents are usually escape from the perovskite film under thermal annealing and do not participate in defect passivation. Besides solvents, Lewis acid/base additives have been widely reported to passivate the Pb–I anti-site defect in the perovskite layer to enhance the operational stability and PCE in PSCs. Lewis acid additives could form Lewis adducts with negatively charged defects such as under-coordinated halide ions and Pb–I anti-sites, as shown in Fig. 2. Cations and fullerene and its derivatives are highly efficient additives that act via the ionic bond or electrostatic interaction (such as the hydrogen bond) with negatively charged defects in perovskites. Lewis base additives are expected to passivate the positively charged defects through coordination interaction with under-coordinated Pb2+ and interstitial Pb2+, whereas zwitterions could passivate negatively and positively charged defects simultaneously.


In the polycrystalline perovskite system, PbX2 (e.g., PbI2 and PbBr2) can be classified as a Lewis acid. PbI2, as a typical Lewis acid, can form PbI2·DMSO or MAI·PbI2·DMSO complexes on reacting with the MAPbI3 precursor, which could retard crystallization and achieve highly uniform perovskite film. In addition, a small amount excess of PbI2 could improve the electronic quality of electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface as self-induced passivation, thus boosting the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSC device. Recently, it has been demonstrated that unreacted PbI2 will decompose to Pb metal and I2 under illumination leading to poor photostability. Pb metal has a detrimental impact on the performance of PSCs as a carrier trap center. Pb(SCN)2 was introduced into perovskite precursor to improve the film crystallinity and stability by suppression of the non-radiative recombination and morphological defects. Other than the Pb-rich condition, excess MAI in the precursor also indicates a positive effect via improved carrier extraction and suppressed non-radiative recombination at GBs. A slight excess of MAI could fill the loss of MAI during the crystal growth process. Moreover, I− in MAI is a strong donor that can interact with Pb2+, thereby forming a consecutive conducting pathway through GBs and improving the photovoltaic performance.

Furthermore, alkali metal ion (e.g., Li+, K+, Rb+ and Na+) incorporation has drawn much attention for defect passivation in high-efficiency PSCs. Li+, as the lightest and smallest metal ion, was added in perovskites to substitute for MA+ or Pb2+, yielding an improved crystallinity and enhanced PCE with suppressed hysteresis as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Meanwhile, Li+ modification led to a down-shift of the quasi-Fermi level of the p side (Efp) and up-shift of the quasi-Fermi level of the n side (Efn), hence improving the charge extraction with enlarged energy level and modulating band bending (Fig. 3c). Li et al. found that Li+ ions could diffuse in the perovskite layer just like the intrinsic ion migration, crossing the absorber layer and accumulating in the ETL layer. By introducing Na+ or K+, defects at GBs and trap states were effectively suppressed along with improved film morphology. Meanwhile, doping Na+ in perovskite nanocrystals or modifying the interface between ETL and perovskite has been implemented to obtain prolonged stability in PSCs. Differing from other reports on defect passivation, Zhou et al. added a small amount of NaX (X = F, Cl, Br or I) in a CsFAMA perovskite, obtaining a maximum PCE of 21.46% with NaF (as depicted in Fig. 3d–f). The NaF molecule could distribute at the surface of the perovskite film as shown in Fig. 3d. The F− ions could passivate the halide anion and organic cation vacancies simultaneously. An N–H⋯F hydrogen bond was formed between N–H and the halogen group due to the strong electronegativity of the F− anion (Fig. 3f). The strong ionic bonding interaction significantly suppressed the organic cation vacancies and improved the thermal stability of the device. Fluorination via F⋯H bond formation does improve the planarity and intermolecular convergence of the conjugated chain. The Na+ cations tend to occupy an interstitial site and increase the ionic charge near I− ions to suppress halide ion diffusion.
Zhao et al. revealed an increased ion migration barrier after alkali ion incorporation, and thus suppressed native defects (e.g., halogen vacancies) both experimentally and theoretically. The K+-doped film showed highly suppressed phase segregation with superior PCE and reduced hysteresis. Abdi-Jalebi et al. recently applied a potassium halide to passivate GBs and surface defects as shown in Fig. 3g. It has been proved that K+ cations moved from the perovskite surface into the bulk but were not incorporated into the lattice. Tan et al. doped SnO2 colloidal solution with KCl as the bilateral agent, achieving a champion PCE up to 22.2% and an enhanced Voc from 1.077 to 1.137 V (Fig. 3h). By combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) as shown in Fig. 3i, it was found that K+ diffused into GBs, which effectively passivated the defects and reduced non-radiative recombination. Meanwhile, K+ and Cl− can individually passivate interfacial defects at the ETL/perovskite layer. Matsui et al. applied a small molar ratio of Rb+ to reduce PbI2 impurity in the perovskite film by the formation of RbPbI3, which showed good thermal stability and suppressed recombination.
It's worth noting that a mass of positively or negatively charged defects would occur generally during rapid crystal growth in high-temperature annealing. Addition of alkaline earth metal ions (such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) and other divalent cations (such as Fe2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) can significantly ameliorate the crystallization and improve the quality of the perovskite film. Owing to the smaller ionic radius of the alkaline earth metal ions than Pb2+ (0.72, 1, 1.18 and 1.19 Å for Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Pb2+, respectively), previous studies have demonstrated the substitution of Pb2+ in the lattice by classical Goldschmidt's rules. Chen et al. reported that it is hard to incorporate Mg2+ into the lattice and Ca2+/Sr2+ was mainly located at the surface to form a passivation layer, whereas incorporation of the large Ba2+ (ionic radius of 1.35 Å) into the lattice would be triggered due to increasing point defects with local lattice strain. Similarly, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) can also be regarded as a Lewis acid, which can gain an electron due to the unpaired electron in the 4f orbit. Wang et al. improved the photovoltaic performance by introducing YbCl3 into the precursor with bifunctional characteristics. The perovskite films were annealed at a low temperature (80 °C) in the absence of the δ-CsPbI3 phase due to the enhanced tolerance factor by partially substituting Pb2+ by Yb3+. Besides, a Lewis adduct of YbCl3·DMSO was formed to distort the framework of [PbI6]4− in the perovskite crystal, thus breaking the continuous periodic structure and forming a small grain size with high symmetry (as shown in Fig. 4a). The trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL) of the 80 °C annealed perovskite film was smaller than that of the 150 °C sample as shown in Fig. 4b and c, which indicated that the perovskite with the YbCl3·DMSO complex had a lower trap density. Besides the interaction of Lewis acid–base adducts via a covalent bond, the reaction can lead to a redox couple as well. More recently, different cations such as Eu3+, Fe3+ and Y3+ have been introduced into MAPbI3 perovskites. Zhou et al. incorporated the rare earth element Eu3+ to achieve both a high PCE up to 21.52% and achieved long-term stability for 1500 h in PSCs. The I-dynamic evolution was monitored by examining the ratio of I/Pb and binding energy (BE) shift in the XPS spectrum. It has been revealed that I0 and Pb0 defects were effectively converted to I− and Pb2+ with the Eu3+ additive that acted as the “redox shuttle”, which can be regenerated in a perfect circle (as depicted in Fig. 4d). The formation energies for defect elimination with the Eu3+-incorporated perovskite were much lower than those of the control perovskite (Fig. 4e), thus stabilizing the energy of the charge–transfer reaction. In addition, the change of free energy ΔG with the Eu3+-incorporated perovskite in Fig. 4f showed actively beneficial physicochemical properties.

A fluorine-containing aromatic molecule as one type of Lewis acid, such as iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB), has strong electronegative fluorine atoms, which can inductively withdraw electron density out of the coterminous aromatic ring and other end of the aromatic ring, leaving a positive charge on this side as shown in Fig. 5a. This special interaction can passivate defects by non-covalent bonding. Meanwhile, as depicted in Fig. 5b, a tris(pentafluorophenyl) phosphine (TPFP) agent, with a strong positive charge centered at phosphorus due to fifteen tough electronegative F atoms, was used for surface halide defect passivation to achieve a maximum PCE of 22.02%. XRD patterns of TPFP-decorated film showed obviously suppressed phase separation compared to the control film after 4 days with 85% humidity. The strong electronegativity was also associated with enhanced hydrophobicity to render slow device degradation. Recently, Luo et al. deposited a Lewis acid dopant (LAD) between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite layer to improve hole extraction and passivate the surface PbI defect. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation in Fig. 5c–j demonstrates that the electron distributions in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels with the LAD-passivated perovskite are mainly localized on the LAD agent while electrons are delocalized and cover the whole lattice in the pristine perovskite. Differently, the electron distributions in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels almost stay the same in the PbI defect. LAD, as an excellent electron acceptor, passivates the trap states at the interface by accepting electrons from the anionic PbI defect. As a result, a champion PCE of 20.32% together with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 23.06 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.79 and a Voc of 1.12 V was achieved (as listed in Table 1). Therefore, the facile Lewis acid treatments significantly passivate detrimental under-coordinated I− ions or PbI anti-sites, which are known as trap states to accumulate charge and interact with foreign atoms (e.g., O atoms and H atoms) under the device operation conditions.

It has been recognized that fullerenes (such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM) not only function as ETLs in PSCs, but also passivate charge traps at the GBs or surface in perovskites. Their spherical shape endows efficient electron accepting capability by accepting an external electron. This approach can strongly reduce their intrinsic strain to act as a Lewis acid. A perovskite-PCBM graded heterojunction structure was applied by dripping an antisolvent-PCBM mixed solution on perovskite film, which was expected to induce a deep deposition before crystallization as shown in Fig. 6a. The gradient band energy level of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) is conducive to interfacial charge separation and collection by assiting the flow of electrons and holes in opposite directions (Fig. 6b). Passivation by PCBM has proven to eliminate J–V hysteresis and surface recombination by forming a free radical with I−, which favors the coordination interaction between PCBM and halide rich defects. Fullerene also plays a crucial role in the deposition of high-quality perovskite crystals with enlarged grains and few GBs, resulting in the mitigation of pinholes and vacancies as demonstrated in Fig. 6c. Zhang et al. reported that α-bis-PCBM-containing perovskite exhibited outstanding stability with less phase separation in an ambient environment (Fig. 6d). Subsequently, bis-PCBM (a Lewis acid) mixed isomers were added in chlorobenzene solution and N-(4-bromophenyl)-thiourea (BrPh-ThR, a Lewis base) within perovskite precursor, respectively to promote the formation of an intermediate phase (as shown in Fig. 6e). BrPh-ThR can coordinate with PbI2 and passivate Pb2+ defects. Simultaneously, the bis-PCBM can passivate PbX3− anti-site defects, improve the perovskite grain size and modulate crystal growth. Therefore, an enhanced PCE of 21.7% was obtained due to the synergistic effect from the cooperation of Lewis acid and Lewis base (as shown in Fig. 6f and Table 1). A similar approach has been demonstrated by Chen et al. Furthermore, a Lewis-acid-featuring fullerene skeleton after iodide ionization (PCBB-3N-3I), exhibiting excellent conductivity and strong molecular electric dipole moment, was deposited on MAPbI3 perovskite. The perovskite with PCBB-3N-3I treatment accurately passivated positively charged defects (such as under-coordinated Pb2+) via electrostatic interaction, which reduced trap-assisted recombination and trap density and improved the PCE (from 17.7% to 21.1%), Jsc (from 22.61 to 23.46 mA cm−2), Voc (from 1.068 to 1.105 V), and FF (from 73.30% to 81.36%) as shown in Table 1.


Owing to the ionic properties of solution-processed perovskites, unexpected hysteresis and device instability could be attributed to the inherent ionic defects. Lewis base additives are expected to passivate the positively charged defects. A Lewis base with electron-donating atoms should have stereo accessibility, and the hardness should be well-matched with the Lewis acid in the perovskite (such as PbI2). In this part, the Lewis base defect passivation is systematically elaborated from four aspects of N-donor, O-donor, S-donor and P-donor.


N-donor Lewis bases, bearing –NH2 tails or –CN chain molecules, have a lone pair of electrons on the N atom, which can passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ ion defects in perovskites. Pyridine and its derivatives, such as 2,2′-bipyridine (Bpy), poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) and 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (Tpy), have been applied to passivate perovskites by the coordinate bond with Pb atoms, meanwhile resulting in suppressed trap-assisted non-radiative recombination, reduced trap defect and efficient electron–hole separation. However, the PVP polymer can act as an electron barrier layer between the HTL and perovskite.

In addition, Huang et al. reported the incorporation of bilateral alkylamines, e.g., 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP), 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH) and 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO), which was beneficial to the pinhole-free morphology by passivating the perovskite grain surface and the operational stability. The coordination interactions with the lone-electron-pair N atom and the empty 6p orbit of Pb2+ are deemed to be a grain anchoring strategy; the –NH2 tails can resist the attack of water by exposing the hydrophobic carbon chains as shown in Fig. 7a. Compared to the control film, the MAPbI3-DAP perovskite shown in Fig. 7b and c retained almost perfect grains after being subjected to eight scanning cycles, and the lifetime was increased over twofold longer (278 ns vs. 689 ns). Liu et al. explained that –NH2 can fill MA vacancies and –COOH could cross-link with Pb2+ in the MAPbI3 perovskite, thus promoting the growth of perovskite crystals with the preferred orientation and improved moisture stability. Urea, a Lewis base with –NH2 groups, has proved beneficial to the crystallinity, morphology and kinetics of perovskite films. The GB defect passivation and prolonged photoluminescence lifetime are favorable for high-efficiency and stable PSCs.
Lin et al. first introduced an n-type π-conjugated Lewis base (indacenodithiophene end-capped with 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone, IDIC), containing cyano and carbonyl groups as the electron withdrawing tail, and the Lewis adduct was expected to passivate traps and facilitate charge extraction (Fig. 7d). Moreover, IDIC revealed better vertical π–π stacking than PCBM from the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) diagram, where the π–π stacking coherence length was 3.5 nm for IDIC and ∼2.5 nm for PCBM. The corresponding deep trap state (4.5 eV) was reduced with IDIC treatment, as shown in Fig. 7e, by the formation of coordinate bonds between under-coordinated Pb, and cyano and carbonyl groups. The n-type π-conjugated Lewis base could promote extraction of electrons generated from the perovskite and then transport them to the cathode in the device, and trigger trap-passivation via shifting deep traps to shallow sites or/and filling the deep traps. The Voc loss was reduced due to a small energy chaos of electron states in the corresponding PSC device. Subsequently, Liu et al. compared four types of organic molecules, PCBM and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) for n-types, and 7,7′-[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]bis[6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and benzodithiophene unit based DR3TBDTT for p-types (as shown in Fig. 7f). These molecules passivated Pb2+ vacancies and PbI defect, decreased the trap density and accelerated carrier transport by a better band level matching. As a result, DR3T showed the lowest trap density (7.4 × 1015 cm−3) and highest hole mobility (1.04 cm2 V−1 s−1). The steady state photoluminescence (PL) quenching as depicted in Fig. 7g was responsible for better charge separation and faster charge collection.
Liu et al. introduced a π-conjugated polymer poly[tetraphenylethene 3,3′-(((2,2-diphenylethene-1,1-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy))bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)tetraphenylethene] (PTN-Br) in FASnI3 perovskite to passivate the positively charged defect through interaction between under-coordinated Sn atoms and dimethylamino groups, as verified by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy spectra. Moreover, amino-functionalized graphene quantum dots (AGQDs) and graphite-nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (GN-GODs) both showed well-matched band structure alignment by the formation of Lewis acid–base adducts, thus yielding high efficiency of 19.55% and 19.8%, respectively.

The Lewis acid–base adduct interaction via the CO bond with Pb2+ has also been widely used to ameliorate crystal growth kinetics or defect passivation. Yang et al. studied a set of small molecules, theophylline, caffeine and theobromine to passivate the perovskite surface by forming the Lewis adduct between the anti-site Pb and CO group as depicted in Fig. 8a–c. The N–H⋯I bonding on theophylline strongly anchored the PbI defects. The intermolecular interaction of the conjugated structure and dipoles caused by hetero atoms rendered a nonvolatile status, with 23.48%, 22.32% and 20.24% PCE for theophylline, caffeine and theobromine treated devices, respectively. The best performance in the case of theophylline was attributed to the well-balanced electron/hole transport in cross-sectional electron-beam–induced current (EBIC) measurement as shown in Fig. 8b and c, which offered fewer surface recombination sites than others. Since poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) has been reported as an effective passivator, Peng et al. fabricated double-side passivated PMMA layers to understand the internal mechanism in both perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces. Through DFT calculations, local negative charges surrounding O atoms in CO groups have been broadly observed, acting as a strong electron donor. As shown in the 1H NMR diagram, it was demonstrated that PbI2 and FAI have no interaction with C or H atoms in PMMA, while strong interaction between CO groups and positively charged Pb2+ and FA+ ions was observed. These excellent passivation properties enabled a Voc up to 1.22 V with a PCE of 20.8% in 1.6 eV bandgap perovskite devices as depicted in Table 1. Some acids containing aromatic rings and multifunctional chains with Lewis base characteristics, such as trimesic acid, thiosalicylic acid and 3,3′,5,5′-azobenzene-tetracarboxylic acid, could improve anti-moisture properties and anchor the under-coordinated Pb2+, simultaneously. More recently, Liu et al. deposited the PMMA polymer using a homemade ozone plasma generator as the hydrophilic group grafting buffer layer (HGGBL) and realized bilateral passivation. The surface potential and tension force on the HTL were found to be decreased by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and XPS measurements. It showed higher binding energy shift in C peak signals and more oxidized oxygen in the FTIR spectrum. The large electron affinity of the absorbed O atoms has a strong ability to pull electrons from PTAA. Meanwhile, the HGGBL approach tends to form a pinhole-free and uniform perovskite film due to the tight coordinate bonding between carbonyl groups, Pb2+ and MA+, thus boosting the PCE to 20.75% with an improved Jsc (from 21.75 to 23.05 mA cm−2) as shown in Table 1. Liu et al. used another polymer poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) containing CO groups in Sn-based PSCs. The grains were enlarged with slow grain growth progress, achieving high-performance and prolonged stability for Sn–PSCs. Chang et al. achieved a PCE of 20.30% using poly{3-(5-([2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-6-(thiazol-2-yl) pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione} (PTzDPPBTz) as a passivating layer in all-perovskite tandem architectures with a remarkable Voc up to 1.87 V. Park et al. used methoxy-functionalized triphenylamine-imidazole derivatives to achieve bifacial-passivated defects and better photoelectric properties. The N atoms in these organic molecules could interact with Ni atoms in NiOx to passivate vacancies of oxygen via Ni–N bonding. Moreover, the methoxy functional groups could act as Lewis bases to passivate halide vacancies possibly by forming Lewis adducts with under-coordinated Pb ions.

Li et al. introduced small organic dye passivators (AQ and AQ310) with the CO group, a strategy to passivate the defects of GBs via enabling coordination and neutralizing charges as demonstrated in Fig. 8d. The stretching vibration of the CO bond in the FTIR spectrum was shifted from 1731 cm−1 in the pure perovskite to 1719 cm−1 in the AQ310-perovskite (Fig. 8e). The hydrophobic alkyl chains in AQ310 endowed low sensitivity to water, resulting in prolonged carrier lifetime, reduced trap states and enhanced Voc with a champion PCE of 19.43%. Yang et al. proposed a polymerization-assisted gain growth (PAGG) strategy by adding dimethyl itaconate (DI) as a monomer in the perovskite precursor. During the annealing process, the polymerization occurred through cleavage of the CC bonds and then rebinding adjacent DI monomers as illustrated in Fig. 8f. Due to the low boiling points, the DI monomers could be volatilized after annealing at 150 °C. It is worth mentioning that the polymerized DI stays at GBs without any other reaction with FAI, which can be attributed to the strong interaction with Pb2+ and its intrinsic large size. This phenomenon was proved with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurement, as shown in Fig. 8g and h; the DI polymer can be clearly distinguished between neighbouring grains in the amorphous area. A champion PCE of 23.0% was achieved with improved stability as demonstrated in Table 1. Therefore, the polymerization process occurring in the amorphous area would be a feasible approach for GB passivation without addition of extra internal grain defects. Huang et al. further passivated under-coordinated Pb defects via wrapping grains within oligomeric silica (OS). The O atoms in the –OCH2CH3 group, as a Lewis base with the electron pair in the C–O bond, attracted the positive charge surrounding the under-coordinated Pb atoms by the coordinate or dative bond, thereby effectively reducing the defect density at the GBs and surface of perovskite. Such electrostatic interaction could enable the defect-induced migration barrier to increase the ambient stability and enhance device efficiency.

In 2014, Snaith et al. reported greatly suppressed non-radiative carrier recombination with thiophene (as the S-donor) passivation, which can donate electrons to Pb atoms, thereby effectively neutralizing adverse positively charged defects as shown in Fig. 9a. Lee et al. and Ko et al. used thiourea to increase grain size growth and the performance of devices. S atoms in thiourea could retard the crystal growth and boost interfacial contacts. Sun et al. applied 2-pyridylthiourea, acting as the N donor and S donor to coordinate with PbI2, to obtain the desired morphology with enlarged grains and improved long-term stability under 55% humidity. Wu et al. demonstrated that pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (ML) could effectively suppress Pb2+ and Pb0 defects. The binding energy of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 with ML shifted toward the lower position as observed in Fig. 9b, thus validating the interaction between thiol groups and undercoordinated Pb2+. During five consecutive XPS scans, as shown in in Fig. 9c, the Pb0 peak did not appear with ML modification, whereas the control film continued to increase due to the Pb0 defects. The mechanism of suppressed Pb0 defects could be attributed to the oxidation reaction of Pb metal to Pb2+, where the thiol chains in the ML ligand could link O2 to form a disulfide intermediate with oxidation characteristics. In addition, a built-in 2D WS2 interlayer was introduced by Liu et al. to accommodate van der Waals quasi-epitaxial crystal growth. Based on the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) analysis of the perovskite/WS2 layer, as shown in Fig. 9d, the W d-orbital is taken into account for CBM and I p-orbital for VBM. Moreover, the ultra-thin WS2 interface definitely illustrates band level adjustment from a deep level to a shallow level for Ii and VPb defects (Fig. 9e), while the TRPL spectra in Fig. 9f manifest a faster charge transport with the 2D WS2 interface. The suppressed defects in the 2D WS2 interlayer promoted photo-generated carrier extraction and reduced charge recombination at the interface. Peng et al. utilized a cross-linking agent, thioctic acid (TA), which contains a covalent disulfide bond and a non-covalent hydrogen bond, to form a hydrophobic poly(TA), which passivated both ETL and perovskite layer as shown in Fig. 9g. The CO and –C–S chains can effectively interact with Ti4+ of the TiO2 surface and Pb2+ in the perovskite through coordinate bonding. Moreover, poly(TA) at the interface or bulk improved the interfacial energy level alignment of ETL/perovskite and HTL/perovskite to promote efficient charge transport (Fig. 9h). The TA passivation enabled a reduced non-radiative recombination center by suppressing PbI defects near the VB edge as theoretically depicted in Fig. 9i. Therefore, the double-passivating effect yielded a high PCE of 20.4% with a Voc up to 1.14 V. Song et al. adopted a fused-ring non-fullerene acceptor material (IDIS-Th) with the sulfonyl group (OSO) to passivate GB defects and reduce charge recombination through coordination interaction with Pb ions/clusters. The corresponding inverted device achieved a PCE of 20.01% with a Jsc of 22.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.116 V and a FF of 0.791. The polymer of perylene diimide and dithienothiophene (PPDIDTT) has also been reported to improve electron mobility and absorption with a well-matched LUMO energy level.


Other functional groups with Lewis base characteristics, such as P-donors (nucleophilic site), have also been applied to form a Lewis acid–base adduct with under-coordinated Pb2+ or Pb clusters (electron-deficient site). The strong interaction indicates a mass of charge transfer due to a low ionization energy in the P-donor, which significantly anchored the perovskite by the Lewis acid–base strategy. In 2016, deQuilettes et al. firstly treated perovskite film with tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and increased the external photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) by 1 order of magnitude (from 3% to 35 ± 1%). The devices coated with ultrathin TOPO could yield high material stability via accelerating the rate of carrier generation. Subsequently, Li et al. compared TOPO and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) via an anti-solvent process. The dipolar PO bond with rich electrons serves as a capping to decrease the defect density, while the π-conjugated benzene ring could resist moisture and facilitate charge transport, thereby improving the PCE with reduced hysteresis. Tetraisopropyl methylenediphosphonate (TMPP) with four P–O–C bonds and two PO bonds show more remarkable passivation than TPPO, though both organophosphorus ligands could anchor under-coordinated Pb2+, halide vacancy and interstitial Pb2+. Analogously, Li et al. introduced tribenzylphosphine oxide (TBPO) in PSCs and 90% of the original PCE could be retained after 3500 h on storage in the dark. The diffusion length for electrons and holes (LeD and LhD), shown in Fig. 10a, increased to 4289 nm and 4030 nm with TBPO passivation, indicating around 47% and 50% increase compared with the control film. The carrier mobility was significantly improved as well as charge recombination velocity was decreased. Besides, the Coulombic interaction between the surface halide and H atoms enabled enhanced binding energy as shown in Fig. 10b, corresponding to −4.2 eV and −2.9 eV for TBPO-perovskite and TPPO-perovskite coordination, respectively. Quan et al. investigated the stability with TPPO, triphenylphosphine sulfide (TPPS), 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-phospholene 1-oxide (MPPO), triphenylphosphine selenide (TPPSe) and other oxides containing CO, SO and AsO end groups against an oxygen-rich environmental attack, where the dative bond of PO:Pb showed the strongest binding energy. The energy level alignment by DFT simulations in Fig. 10c revealed nitrosobenzene (PNO) and benzophenone (DPCO) embedded states within the perovskite bandgap, resulting in superior PLQE by TPPO treatment as described in Fig. 10d. MPPO also showed small steric hindrance, which could bind with Pb2+ positively. Therefore, these phosphine oxide ligands effectively tighten the distribution of quantum wells, evacuate the charge defect and reduce the injection barrier.


Zwitterions, consisting of two functional groups through covalent bonding with a overall charge of zero, show an excellent bilateral effect by passivating both negatively charged defect and positively charged defect. Due to their special feature of constituting an interfacial dipole, a zwitterionic molecule is regarded as a cost-effective and remarkable strategy for defect passivation in PSCs. Zheng et al. ingeniously designed quaternary ammonium halide groups and reached a PCE of 21% with choline chloride by a one-step-coating method. The passivation effect, in FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite, on MA+ vacancies and cationic Pb2+ by the strong Pb–Cl bonding remarkably decreased the trap density and prolonged the carrier lifetime in the slow decay process as shown in Fig. 11a. Meanwhile, the choline chloride passivation could resist the permeation of O2 and moisture and enhance ambient stability by covering the defect sites. In addition, zwitterions have also been reported as interface modification layers. Choi et al. deposited a 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate linking agent in planar SnO2-based PSCs (Fig. 11b). The zwitterion molecule with the –SO3− group can react with hydroxyl groups at the SnO2 surface. Meanwhile, the positively charged atoms (N atoms) could induce a coordinative interaction with Pb atoms to passivate PbI anti-site defect and decrease trap states. The flat-band potential (Vfb) in the Mott–Schottky curve of Fig. 11c with the zwitterion modified film is around 0.11 V higher than that of the pristine film, which triggers a higher Voc in the corresponding PSC device (1.10 V vs. 1.16 V). The zwitterion-treated SnO2 can also improve the thermal stability with less yellow PbI2 phase formation due to the coordination of PbI3− and halide ion defects. Zheng et al. reported two zwitterions, 4,4′-(((methyl(4-sulphonatobutyl)ammonio)bis(propane-3,1-diyl))bis(dimethyl-ammoniumdiyl))bis-(butane-1-sulfonate) (MSAPBS) and 4,4′-((oxybis-(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(dimethylammoniumdiyl))-bis(butane-1-sulfonate) (OEABS), to passivate the interfacial and bulk defects in PSCs. As shown in Fig. 11d, the SnO2/MSAPBS showed the smallest of the root mean square surface roughness (σRMS). The EDS mapping in Fig. 11e proved that S could not only adhere to the bottom SnO2 layer but also diffuse into the perovskite film. With regard to the XPS depth of Pb2+ and Pb0 ratio (Fig. 11f), in spite of the increasing Pb vacancies and defect densities after the sputtering time near the ETL/perovskite interface, the SnO2/MSAPBS films inhibited the Pb0 defect in the interface as well as the bulk due to the bilateral effect. Wu et al. used donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) molecules (SP1, SP2 and SP3) to minimize the trap state and suppress non-radiative recombination. The OC–O group as the electron-withdrawing end chain has a high electron density to coordinate with under-coordinated Pb2+ as shown in Fig. 11g. The decreased trap density in Fig. 11h indicated that the SP3 is more efficient to exclude ion-induced trap states in MAPbI3 perovskite than in SP1 and SP2 (3.02 × 1016 cm−3 for the pristine, 2.69 × 1016 cm−3 for SP1, 1.95 × 1016 cm−3 for SP2, and 9.7 × 1015 cm−3 for SP3). The corresponding SP3 device displayed a champion PCE of 20.43% with a Voc of 1.146 V (80 mV improvement). Moreover, Wang et al. reported that sulfobetaine doped in CsPbI3 perovskite can impede crystallization to form small grains and stabilize the black phase (α phase). An amorphous phase was observed before the thermal annealing process through electrostatic interaction with PbI2·DMSO colloids and zwitterions, implying that the quaternary amine (N+) group and sulfonate (SO3−) group contributed to small-grain perovskite films. Zheng et al. applied a sulfonic zwitterion (3-(decyldimethylammonio)-propane-sulfonate inner salt (DPSI)) to suppress the formation of pinholes and thereafter enabled a high PCE of 21.1%. The zwitterionic property of DPSI can neutralize both positively and negatively charged defects at GBs and surfaces, thereafter facilitating crystallization and suppressing the formation of morphological defects. Therefore, dual-functionalized zwitterion additives show a dual pathway that triggers high-efficiency PSCs by uniting defect passivation and morphology tailoring.


Positively or negatively charged defects inevitably occur at surfaces or GBs due to the ionic character of PSCs. The design of Lewis acid or base molecules through coordinate bonding to suppress undesired charge defects has proven to be an efficient strategy in defect engineering with well-matched band structure. Through codoping combined with DFT calculations, Liu et al. obtained a champion PCE of 15.19% in the CsPbI2Br device by doping tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) in the C60 layer. The C60·TPFPB complex has a stable structure configured by B⋯C60 bonding as demonstrated in Fig. 12a, which is dominated by dispersion with a total combining energy of −18.6 kcal mol−1. The calculated LUMO level of the C60·TPFPB complex decreased from −3.22 to −3.34 eV owing to less delocalization across the π-conjugated framework as shown in Fig. 12b, which thereafter promoted electron injection. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results further verified the LUMO energy level, as shown in Fig. 12c. Note that the dissociative TPFPB could coordinate with ClO4− in LiClO4. This approach simultaneously enhanced the conductivity due to the presence of Li+ ions. 6TIC-4F, having two electron-withdrawing units 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC–2F) and a strong electron-donating core terthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (6T), has been applied to reduce the shallow defects on the CsPbIxBr3−x perovskite as shown in Fig. 12d. DFT calculations on pristine and 6TIC-4F/Cs44Pb27I99 cluster in Fig. 12e and f clearly demonstrated that the valence electron densities shifted towards the bulk cluster. Meanwhile, the energy level diagram in Fig. 12g explains the surface trap elimination with 6TIC-4F passivation. In addition, the LUMO level of 6TIC-4F (−4.14 eV) was located between ZnO (−4.25 eV) and perovskite (−3.49 eV) as depicted in Fig. 12h, thus promoting charge transport across the interface and enabling a high Jsc and FF. Zhao et al. delivered a Lewis-base organic NIR-chromophore, IEICO-4F, in an anti-solvent during the spin-coating process in CsFAMA perovskite. The CsFAMA-IEICO-4F layer enabled higher charge mobility and lower trap density, and well aligned energy level.


Although PSCs have better radiative efficiency than other photovoltaic devices like dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), they still face non-negligible non-radiative loss that limits superior device performance. Non-radiative recombination losses could be attributed to the presence of considerable defect density or recombination centers. The density of trap states, formed by defects and GBs, hinders the diffusion of free charge carriers, leading to non-radiative recombination and seriously reduces charge carrier lifetime and PL intensity. Generally, the non-radiative recombination triggered by intrinsic defects causes a Voc loss and deteriorated PCE of PSCs. The under-coordinated halide ions and Pb2+ ions could form recombination centers due to the undesirable trap states, where halide ions bring hole traps and Pb2+ ions bring electron traps. Some theoretical calculations have proved that Lewis molecules greatly slow down the non-radiative loss and extend the excited-state lifetime. Lewis bases could decrease the non-adiabatic coupling and change the localization of electron wavefunction. Thiophene serves as a charge recombination site through removed electron density at the surface. Pyridine forms a strong dative bond with the Pb atom and localizes electrons close to the surface, leading to a LUMO level near the perovskite CB edge. Braly et al. passivated the surface defects via TOPO treatment. The quasi-Fermi-level splitting (Δμ) and photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) were characterized both externally and internally. Under one Sun equivalent illumination as shown in Fig. 13a–c, the TOPO-treated film exhibited higher ηext (∼20.3) and Δμ (∼1.28 eV) than the control film (∼ 0.92 and 1.21 eV, respectively). The radiative limit χ further increased from 91.7% to 97.1% by monitoring the extracted bandgap of 1.60 eV as shown in Fig. 13d. Additionally, the internal PLQE (ηint) dramatically increased from ∼9.4% to 91.9% (Fig. 13e and f). This defect passivation can lead to less non-radiative energy loss, and increased radiative efficiency, which may enhance the Voc and device performance to obtain the Shockley–Queisser limit. Therefore, more accurate and specific Lewis-coordinated design can decrease the non-radiative recombination at the surface or GBs leading to even higher performance PSCs.


The large photocurrent J–V hysteresis observed in PSCs has become a major factor limiting the long-term stability and stable performance. Device hysteresis behavior is generally derived from many factors, such as unmatched band level alignment, unbalanced charge transfer, ion migration, ferroelectricity and adverse trap states at the GBs and surface. The non-negligible defects within or near the surface could act as electron/hole traps and increase recombination under bias conditions, hence exaggerating the issue of hysteresis behavior. Functional Lewis acid/base molecules could eliminate the photocurrent hysteresis of PSCs through coordinate bonding with perovskite. Yang et al. passivated ionic and neutral defects using D-4-tert-butylphenylalanine (D4TBP), which contains three functional groups for passivation (4-tert-butylphenyl, amine, and carboxyl group) through the ionic and coordination interactions. D4TBP contains six π electrons delocalized in the aromatic benzene ring, which can capture residual I2 acting as electronic defects at the surface and GBs. A high Voc up to 1.23 V in a 1.57 eV bandgap device with negligible photocurrent hysteresis was achieved, thus setting a record of the lowest Voc deficit of 0.34 V. Yang et al. employed an n-type helical molecule perylene diimide (PDI2) to ensure high electron conductivity and surface defect passivation by chelating under-coordinated Pb and O atoms, which contributed to reduce surface traps at the interface and suppress hysteresis. Similarly, Yang et al. anchored the PbI6 octahedral framework with a non-fullerene Lewis base to decrease the localized defects for efficient carrier separation, thus yielding a PCE of 20.5% with repressed hysteresis. Additionally, some HTLs with Lewis features have been reported to passivate the perovskite/HTL interface and improve hole extraction, simultaneously. Reddy et al. used 4,4′-(5,5′-(pyridine-2,6-diylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis (N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (PyThTPA) to attain enhanced durability and PCE with less hysteresis. The small organic agent, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF), acting as a Lewis acid, could form a Lewis adduct with PyThTPA and interact with MAPbI3 crystals, resulting in ameliorated hole extraction and mitigated carrier recombination between the perovskite and HTL interface.


Ambient long-term stability is a crucial requirement for the commercial application of PSCs. Device degradation mainly occurs at GBs due to trap-assisted non-radiative recombination. Lewis acids and bases with functional groups are a popular choice that can effectively passivate defects such as antisites and vacancies. Previous studies have demonstrated both improved optoelectronic properties and environmental stability for heterojunction 2D/3D perovskites with the features of high formation energy and moisture-resistance. However, 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites inevitably limit superior efficiency on account of their relatively large band gap and undesirably decreased charge mobility. Recently, Niu et al. realized the fusion of 2D/3D perovskite bulk heterojunctions and molecular passivation with the Lewis base group (rhodanine-benzothiadiazole-coupled indacenodithiophene, IDTBR). The IDTBR molecule exists at GBs, while the RP phase is interspersed in 3D grains, which totally constitute the IDTBR-RP-3D heterostructure as demonstrated in Fig. 14a. The coordination interaction between Lewis base IDTBR and under-coordinated Pb2+ ions within the perovskite diminishes the trap state defects. Promisingly, the Lewis base-decorated 2D/3D device showed 87% PCE retention after 60 days test in an ambient atmosphere (Fig. 14b). Similarly, Qin et al. incorporated an organic non-fullerene material, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(5-hexylthienyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′] dithiophene (ITIC-Th) to achieve a PCE of 19.2% by suppressing the unwanted Pb0 defect. The CO and CN chains, as an electron acceptor, could coordinate with Pb2+ ions, and thereby contribute to the FF improvement in the PSC device. Interestingly, the perovskite film with ITIC-Th retained the all-black phase (α-phase) after aging for 96 days, while the control perovskite film decayed into the yellow phase (δ-phase) after 12 days exposure, as shown in Fig. 14c. At the same time, the XRD peak of 14.1° in Fig. 14d for the ITIC-Th-modified perovskite remained almost unchanged, which indicated enhanced α-phase stability. In contrast, the α-phase peak gradually decreased and the hexagonal δ-phase of FAPbI3 (11.7°) unfavorably appeared with aging in the control perovskite film. Xie et al. introduced different methoxysilane cross-linking agents, 3-cyanopropyltriethoxysilane (CPTS, with the electron-accepting group –CN), trimethoxy(propyl)silane (PTS) and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTS, with the soft electron-donating groups –CH3 and –SH), and indirectly proved that VI defect is the dominant defect in perovskites. MPTS-modified PSCs achieved a high PCE of 20.81%, which could be attributed to the strong interaction between –SH and PbI2 by providing the lone pair of electrons on the S atom to the empty 6p orbit of Pb2+ (as shown in Fig. 14e). The TRPL decay in MPTS showed a prolonged lifetime, indicating that MPTS could effectively suppress trap state defects. The MPTS device exhibited prominent thermal and moisture stability as depicted in Fig. 14f. Zhao et al. designed a multifunctional Lewis base passivating layer (poly(N-alkyldiketopyrrolopyrrole dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene), DPP-DTT) with lone pairs of electrons (S, O, N atoms), to improve hole extraction and transport, and moisture stability, as an ultra-hydrophobic agent. Hydrophobic agents resist the attack of water and the Lewis base chains could stabilize the α-phase in a moist atmosphere. Some other hydrophobic Lewis agents (such as poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′] dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PDBD-T) and SY1–SY4) as the interfacial layers are also responsible for moisture intrusion barrier with excellent stability.


Since the rapid development of PSCs, their ever-increasing performance coupled with low-cost materials and simple fabricating process have attracted special attention from both the academic and industrial community, undoubtedly emerging as an economic contender to next-generation commercial photovoltaic technologies. In order to deliver remarkable operational performance and long-term stability simultaneously, defect passivation has proven to be indispensable. In this review, we systematically expounded the origin of defects and the recent advancement of passivation strategies using Lewis acids, Lewis bases and zwitterions, with coordinated interaction or electrostatic interaction. Due to the ionic properties of the perovskite lattice, Lewis acids can coordinate with halides to target the negatively charged defects (e.g., halides and PbI anti-site defects) and Lewis bases can passivate positively charged defects of under-coordinated Pb2+ or Sn2+ ions/clusters, whereas zwitterions enable passivation of both charged defects. Through the existence of a precursor–passivator complex or interfacial-passivator layer, it is feasible to reduce trap state density and suppress non-radiative recombination as well as achieve perfectly matched band level alignment, which improve the final photovoltaic efficiency and ambient stability with the eliminated hysteresis of PSCs. The versatile utilization of various organic passivators (e.g., NIR dyes, polymers, chromophores and organic small molecules) gives ample room for molecular design for defect passivation.

The successful implementation of the Lewis acid/base approach for defect passivation in recent high-performance PSC devices is undeniable. However, a deep understanding of full-scale passivation mechanisms still poses a great challenge, largely due to the multi-functional feature of some Lewis acids/bases. Further combinational research from systematic theoretical simulation and experimental verification will be crucial to achieve efficacious passivation across different perovskite fabrication processes. Meanwhile, most of the established passivation approaches are limited to one or two trap states, which is hard to make one-to-one correspondence with specific functional groups. Moreover, Lewis molecules in 2D/3D perovskites as well as lead-free perovskites have been rarely reported so far. We expect more attempts of multi-dimensional perovskites along with Lewis additives to achieve both ambient long-term stability and high optoelectronic performance. The Lewis adduct approach offers plenty of opportunities for upscaling manufacture of high-efficiency PSCs by transforming the laboratory-scale spin-coating approach to large-scale deposition methods due to the highly maneuverable designing and facile surface modification protocol. With more in-depth research of molecular design and passivation mechanism, we believe the Lewis approach will help us to further decipher intrinsic effects on energy level alignment, recombination kinetics, and J–V hysteresis in perovskite devices or other related optoelectronic devices.
