Four π-conjugated benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based polymers were synthesized for application in polymer solar cells. These polymers possessed desirable HOMO/LUMO levels for polymer photovoltaic applications. PBDTT–TTz and PBDTT–DTBT displayed strong absorption in the range of 300–650 nm, while PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP showed a further 100 nm extended absorption band. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of polymers were tuned effectively from −3.34 eV to −3.81 eV by fusing with different accepting units. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.60% was obtained from photovoltaic cells with a PBDTT–TTz:PC61BM (1:2, w/w) blend film as the active layer, with a short circuit current density of 8.37 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.70 V, and a fill factor of 44.3%.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs), especially adopting the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure, have attracted significant attention due to their advantages in fabricating low cost, light weight, and flexible large-area devices by ink-jet printing and roll-to-roll solution processes. The active-layer structure of BHJ cells ideally consists of an interpenetrating network of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor. The power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of PSCs have been promoted over 10%. However, there are still some key issues that need to be solved before its commercial application, such as higher PCEs, and dependable encapsulation technology to secure long-life working devices.

The ideal polymer should have an extended absorption band and relatively low-lying HOMO energy level to offset with fullerenes for efficient charge separation while maximizing the open circuit voltage and high hole mobility. Besides, the solubility of polymers and their compatibility with PC61BM is necessary for solution processing. The development of low bandgap (LBP) polymers by alternating electron-rich donating (D) and electron-deficient accepting (A) units along the conjugated backbone has proved to be an effective strategy, owing to the facile tunability of their absorption range, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and charge carrier mobility.
Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely explored in high performance PSCs, due to its large and planar molecular structure by fusing a benzene with two flanking thiophene units, which would help promote backbone π–π stacking to facilitate charge transport. BDT based PSCs have shown greatly enhanced mobilities and high PCEs surpassing 8%. Meanwhile, 4,8-alkylthienyl substituted BDT donors were used to extend the conjugation along side-chains and tune the energy level for the resulting polymers.
Among the variety of electron deficient acceptors, thiazolo[5,4-d]-thiazole (TTz) used for D–A copolymers was stimulated by its high carrier mobilities (0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Dithienyl-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) has attracted much attention for its special property of controlling the energy levels for D–A conjugated polymers. Pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridge pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (TTDPP) have showed potential in designing LBG polymers, due to their broad optical absorption, ease of synthesis, thermal stability and high electron-withdrawing effect.
Herein, we synthesized four new D–A copolymers, namely, PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP. They were composed of a thiophene substituted BDT donor unit and acceptor units including TTz, DTBT, DPP and TTDPP. DTBT and TTz units were modified with alkyloxy (a slightly more electron-rich) to increase the electron donating nature for tuning the electronic properties of the polymers. The DPP unit was substituted with N-2-octyl-1-dodecyl (C8C12) alkyl chains to enhance the solubility. The electron-deficient DPP unit was flanked by two thiophenes or larger thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units to tune the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the resulting polymers. It is the first report discussing the alternating copolymers of 2D-BDT and alkoxylated TTz. The thermal, optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting polymers were systematically studied. The best BHJ device by blending PBDTT–TTz with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.60%, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.37 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.70 V and a fill factor (FF) of 44.3%.

PSCs devices were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Ca or PFN/Al. The thickness and sheet resistance of the ITO were 130 nm and 15 Ω per square, respectively. The ITO glass substrates were sonicated sequentially in deionized water, acetone, deionized water and isopropanol. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the substrates were cleaned by oxygen plasma for 4 min. Firstly, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS, CleviosP1000) thin film (40 nm) was spin-coated and then dried at 150 °C for 15 min. Then, the copolymers:PC61BM (different weight ratio) active blend layer, with a nominal thickness of ∼80 nm, was spin-coated on the top of PEDOT/PSS from the o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution (concentration of polymer solution, 10 mg ml−1). An ∼5 nm interlayer material poly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN) was spin-coated on the top of the active layer through its methanol solution in the presence of small amounts of acetic acid or interlayer material Ca was deposited under high vacuum. Finally, the Al layer was subsequently evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (∼2 × 8 mm2) and form a top anode to complete the photovoltaic device fabrication. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and PCE were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun of simulated air mass 1.5G (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel model 91192) at room temperature in a nitrogen filled glove-box. The solar simulator illumination intensity was determined by using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with KG-5 visible color filter), and calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).


All chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Acros or TCI and used without further purification. Toluene, THF and diethyl ether were dried over sodium–benzophenone and freshly distilled before used. Chloroform and dichloromethane were purified by refluxing over CaH2 and freshly distilled under nitrogen for use. If not specified otherwise, the other solvents were used directly. Column chromatography was carried out with 300–400 nm mesh silica.


The general procedure for the synthesis of PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP by Stille coupling is shown in Scheme 1. Typically, in a Schlenk tube, M1 (0.4 mmol) and M2 (or M3, M4) (0.4 mmol) were dissolved in dry toluene (10 mL) and dry dimethylformamide (1 mL). The catalyst Pd2(dba)3 (11.0 mg, 0.012 mmol, 3%) and ligand P(o-tolyl)3 (14.6 mg, 0.048 mmol, 12%) were added quickly. After flushing with nitrogen for 15 minutes, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 48 h. The reactant was cooled down to room temperature and poured into 200 mL methanol. The precipitate was collected and Soxhlet-extracted in sequence with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform. The polymer was recovered from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation and precipitated in methanol. The polymer was dried under vacuum. The yield and NMR results of the polymers were as follows.

By adopting a similar procedure, the Stille coupling of M1 (271.4 mg, 0.3 mmol) and M5 (339.4 mg, 0.3 mmol) in dry chlorobenzene (10 mL) afforded the title polymer as a bluish green solid (82% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 9.29 (br, 2H), 7.72–7.33 (br, 6H), 7.05–6.92 (br, 2H), 4.08 (br, 4H), 2.90 (br, 4H), 2.05–2.04 (br, 4H), 1.35–1.21 (br, 80H), 0.98–0.83 (br, 24H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 161.02, 145.94, 143.78, 139.45, 138.89, 138.33, 137.71, 136.90, 135.20, 131.34, 127.97, 127.79, 127.54, 125.52, 125.02, 123.49, 108.03, 46.67, 41.46, 38.04, 34.33, 32.55, 32.20, 31.90, 31.21, 29.66, 29.36, 28.96, 26.39, 25.80, 23.42, 23.05, 22.67, 14.10, 10.96. Molecular weight by GPC: Mn = 25.12 kDa, PDI = 1.60.


The synthetic routes for the monomers are outlined in Scheme S1 (ESI). 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (M1), 2,5-bis(5-bromo-3-dodecyloxythiophen-2yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (M2), 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M3), 2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (M4), 3,6-bis(2-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (M5) were synthesized according to a similar procedure reported in the literature. The detailed synthetic processes are described in the (ESI). With the monomers in hand, the alternative D–A copolymers were synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction, with the general synthetic routes for copolymers outlined in Scheme 1.

After polymerization, the resulting polymers were precipitated from a methanol solution, washed successively with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform, and then dried under reduced pressure. In this way, oligomers and palladium were eliminated from the polymer solids. All polymers have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were determined by GPC analysis with polystyrene as the standard. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of polymers was estimated to be 11.84, 10.05, 14.61 and 25.12 kDa for PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP, and PBDTT–TTDPP, respectively, with the corresponding PDI of 1.48, 1.34, 1.66 and 1.60. Interestingly, PBDTT–TTDPP prepared from chlorobenzene exhibited a higher Mn than all other polymers obtained from toluene.
The thermal stability of the four polymers was evaluated using TGA. As shown in Fig. 1, all polymers show good thermal stability, with the decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight-loss temperature) at 380, 332, 304, and 398 °C for PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP, and PBDTT–TTDPP, respectively. The slightly lower Td at 304 °C for PBDT–DPP could be due to the lower Mn and the slightly lower stability of the DPP unit. However, the thermal stability of the four copolymers is good enough for the applications in optoelectronic devices.


Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solutions (∼10−5 M) and films spin-coated on quartz substrates. As clearly shown in Fig. 2a, the PBDTT–TTz solution has one absorption band in the range of 400–700 nm with a λmax at 552 nm, which was in coincidence with the weak electron-deficient ability of the TTz unit. In contrast, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP solutions exhibited two major absorption bands in the wavelength ranges of 300–500 and 500–850 nm with a λmax at 523, 664, and 671 nm, respectively. The peak at longer wavelength could be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), while the peak at shorter wavelength is due to the π–π* transition of the polymer main chain. Apparently, PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP have a much-extended absorption in comparison to PBDTT–TTz and PBDTT–DTBT, whose absorption maximum extended to ∼670 nm.

The absorption spectra of the four polymers in thin films are shown in Fig. 2b, and the optical properties are summarized in Table 1. The shape of the peaks and the trend of the absorption wavelength were generally similar to those of the polymer solutions. The absorption maxima of the polymer films were all red-shifted in comparison to those in solutions, which is a common phenomenon for the conjugated polymers owing to the aggregation of the conjugated polymer main chains in the solid films. In addition, PBDTT–DTBT exhibited a broad peak from 523 nm to 574 nm, indicating the existence of strong ICT and aggregation in the solid-state, which is probably related to the increased extent of π–π stacking of the backbones and the increased polarizability in polymer films.

The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of the polymers were determined from the UV-vis absorption onsets in the solid state according to equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset eV. The Eoptg of PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP, and PBDTT–TTDPP were thus estimated to be 1.83, 1.77, 1.50, and 1.46 eV, respectively. The Eoptg of PBDTT–TTz (1.83 eV) was narrower than PBDTTTz (2.0 eV) because the alkoxy side chains of the thiophene bridge increased the electron donating nature compared with the alkyl side chain. The Eoptg of PBDTT–TTz was narrower than PBDTTTz PBDTTT–TIPS (1.94 eV) as well. One conclusion could be drawn that the 2D-BDT donating unit could efficiently decrease Eoptg through enlarging the conjugated system of the polymer backbone, which agrees well with earlier literature. PBDTT–DTBT (1.77 eV) exhibited a larger Eoptg than PBDTTDTBT (1.66 eV), while PBDTT–DPP (1.50 eV) shows a larger Eoptg than PBDTTDPP (1.46 eV). This behavior demonstrated that the longer branched alkyl chain could lead to increased Eoptg because of the steric hindrance from long side-chains. From the smaller Eoptg data of PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP in comparison to PBDTT–TTz and PBDTT–DTBT, it could be concluded that the electron-withdrawing ability of the accepting DPP and TTDPP units is stronger than that of TTz and DTBT units. Comparing the two DPP-based polymers, the thiophene bridge was substituted by a larger thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridge. As a result, PBDTT–TTDPP shows a narrower Eoptg in comparison with PBDTT–DPP. It can be concluded that the extended π-conjugation through flanking the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridge is helpful to improve the UV-vis absorption of DPP-polymers.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the polymers were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). The HOMO level of polymers can be calculated from the onset potentials (Eonsetox) of the oxidation curves, while the LUMO level can be calculated using HOMO and optical Eg. The Eonsetox were observed to be 0.77, 1.00, 0.91, and 0.84 V for PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP, and PBDTT–TTDPP, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding HOMO energy levels of these copolymers were calculated to be −5.17, −5.40, −5.31 and −5.24 eV, respectively (Table 1). The LUMO levels of these copolymers were thus calculated to be −3.34, −3.63, −3.81, −3.78 eV, respectively. The deep HOMO levels (≤−5.0 eV) of these polymers should be beneficial to their chemical stability under ambient conditions. In addition, the deep HOMO levels of copolymers will lead to a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the PSCs based on these copolymers as donors, since Voc of the PSCs is proportional to the difference between the LUMO of the electron acceptor and the HOMO of the electron donor.
The HOMO–LUMO energy diagrams of the polymers and PC61BM are shown in Fig. 3. It is obvious that the HOMO energy levels of the four polymers are almost identical due to the HOMO level primarily governed by the donor unit in the polymer backbone. However, their LUMO energy levels are strongly dependent upon the accepting unit. Among the four accepting units used, PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP both based on pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) have a lower LUMO than PBDTT–TTz and PBDTT–DTBT due to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability. When the electron-deficient DPP unit is flanked by larger thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units (TTDPP), the corresponding polymer (PBDTT–TTDPP) has a higher HOMO level (−5.24 eV) because of the extended delocalization of electrons along the backbone. We could conclude that thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as a bridge could precisely tune the HOMO/LUMO energy level of polymers, which is consistent with the reported finding in other groups. PBDTT–TTz based on the weak electron-accepting thiazolothiazole (TTz) unit has the highest lying LUMO level (−3.34 eV). Therefore, DPP based polymers have a narrower Eoptg and much wider absorption range.

To better understand the differences between the four polymers in HOMO/LUMO levels and planarity, the theoretical model was initially optimized using the HF/3-21G level. To simplify the calculations, long alkyl or alkyloxy side chains were substituted by methyl or methoxy, respectively. The optimal geometries and electronic structures of the polymers were simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level using the Gaussian 09 program suite. As shown in Fig. 4, the electron density of LUMO was mainly focused on the acceptor segment. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP were calculated to be −4.98/−2.43 eV, −4.73/−2.64 eV, −4.72/−2.77 eV and −4.75/−2.85 eV, respectively. The bandgaps of the four polymers were determined to be 2.55 eV, 2.09 eV, 1.95 eV and 1.90 eV, respectively. Obviously, the trends of bandgaps, HOMOs and LUMOs are consistent with those obtained from UV-vis absorption and CV measurements (Table 1). The bandgaps of DPP-containing polymers were lower than others. PBDTT–TTDPP had the lowest bandgap owing to the extended π-conjugation through flanking the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridge. It is known that good planarity is beneficial for π–π stacking to achieve high mobility. Therefore, dihedral angles between the repeating units in the four polymers were calculated and are shown in Table 2.

Dihedral angle values of the four polymers have an order of PBDTT–TTz > PBDTT–DTBT > PBDTT–DPP > PBDTT–TTDPP. The planarity of the four polymers thus have an order of PBDTT–TTz < PBDTTDTBT < PBDTT–DPP < PBDTT–TTDPP. When the thienyl group was modified with alkyloxy, the dihedral angles between thienyl and the neighbor units were larger than that of other thienyl groups. However, when the thienyl bridges were replaced by thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, the dihedral angles decreased a lot, leading to better planarity of PBDTT–TTDPP. It was demonstrated that the dihedral angles were so large that the backbone planarity of polymers was very poor, which possibly resulted in low FF, Jsc and PCE for the polymer-based devices (discussed in the next section). It is worth noting that the calculated values may not be exactly consistent with the experimental data because the only simplified repetition unit of the polymer backbone was taken into consideration. However, this theoretical analysis still shows the interplay between their structural modifications and the resulting electronic and optical changes.

To investigate and compare the photovoltaic properties of the four copolymers, BHJ solar cells with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Ca or ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/PFN/Al were fabricated. The photoactive layers were prepared by spin-coating the blend solution of polymer:PC61BM (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 wt%) in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), in which the polymer showed good solubility, on ITO/PEDOT:PSS patterned substrates (40 nm). The thickness of all blend films was around 80 nm. The active area of the cells was 0.16 cm2. All devices were prepared under an inert nitrogen atmosphere and characterized in air without encapsulation. The effect of insertion of PFN or a Ca interfacial layer on device performance was studied. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices based on polymer–PC61BM blend films before and after thermal annealing were also compared.

Different PBDTT–TTz or PBDTT–DTBT/PC61BM weight ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) have been investigated to optimize the photovoltaic properties. The polymer/PC61BM weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best device performance. The devices were further optimized by inserting PFN as a cathode interfacial layer. Two device structures were explored, i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC61BM (1:2)/Ca (5 nm)/Al (80 nm), and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC61BM (1:2)/PFN (5 nm)/Al (80 nm), where the polymer was either PBDTT–TTz or PBDTT–DTBT. For the latter structure, thermal annealing at 90 °C for 10 min was carried out.
Among the three devices, devices were different in the cathode interfacial layer and thermal annealing of the active layer for devices using the PFN interfacial layer. The J–V curves of three devices recorded under illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5, with the photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 3. The positive effect of the cathode interfacial layer and thermal annealing for the active layer was observed on the device performance. After the Ca layer was replaced with the PFN layer, the devices improved in FF to deliver a PCE of 2.03%. The device after thermal annealing further increased the PCE to 2.60%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.70 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 8.37 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 44.3% (Fig. 5a and Table 3). Compared with the reported one-dimensional based BDT and TTz without alkoxy copolymer PBDTTTz photovoltaic cells, PBDTT–TTz exhibited high Voc but a much lower Jsc and FF.

The PBDTT–DTBT:PC61BM (1:2) devices with Ca or PFN as the electron transporting layers were compared. The devices of PBDTT–DTBT achieved an increased PCE from 1.17% to 1.64% after the Ca layer was replaced with PFN without thermal annealing (Fig. 5b). The thermal annealed device exhibited unobvious improvement in performance, where a PCE of 1.71% was obtained with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 5.71 mA cm−2 and a FF of 35.7% (Fig. 5b and Table 3). Compared with the photovoltaic performance of similarly structured polymer PBDTTDTBT, our PBDTT–DTBT exhibited higher Voc but a much lower Jsc and FF, which may be explained with its high-lying HOMO level and the long alkoxy side-chains on the BT unit. Meanwhile, the DPP-based polymers with a longer alkyl side-chains exhibited very low efficiencies (PCE < 0.30). The steric hindrance from long side-chains may decrease the packing of the polymer backbone for efficient charge transfer. This may be the reason for the low PCEs of polymer solar cells.
Usually, the Voc of photovoltaic cells is related to the LUMO energy level of the electron acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the polymer donor, i.e., a lower HOMO of the polymer donor is beneficial for achieving higher Voc for BHJ cells. Compared with PBDTT–TTz, PBDTT–DPP and PBDTT–TTDPP, PBDTT–DTBT devices exhibited relatively higher Voc, due to their low-lying HOMO energy level. The smooth surface of the blend film implied good miscibility between the polymers and fullerene domains. The morphology observation for the active layers did no;t find an effective nano-scaled phase separation interpenetrating donor–acceptor network which is not favorable for electron and hole transfer. This may be another reason why the J–V curves showed an S-shape with high contact resistances, resulting in a lower conversion efficiency. More careful device processing and post-treatment may be needed to optimize the topography in the active layers for better device performance.

In this study, we have synthesized a series of copolymers containing alkylthienyl substituted BDT donating units and different accepting units through a Stille coupling reaction. The BDT alternating thiazolo[5,4-d]-thiazole polymer (PBDTT–TTz) was firstly reported with alkoxylated thiophene as the spacer. The as-prepared polymers had a bandgap from 1.46 to 1.83 eV and a HOMO energy level ranging from −5.17 to −5.40 eV, tuned by using different accepting units. The results indicate that TTz and DTBT are good accepting units to copolymerize with the 2D-BDT donating unit. The PBDTT–TTz/PC61BM (1:2) devices with PFN as the cathode interfacial layer delivered the best PCE of 2.60%. Our results show that the 2D-BDT unit and the TTz unit with long alkyl chains on the thiophene spacer could become the choice to construct D–A polymers for high-efficient photovoltaic solar cell materials. It is believed that further studies and developments of these materials may improve the photocurrent conversion efficiency.
