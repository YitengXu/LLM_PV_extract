In this paper, we developed new types of efficient large band-gap copolymers, PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI, based on a 1,2,5,6-naphthalenediimide (1,2,5,6-INDI) acceptor block for polymer solar cells (PSCs). PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI have band-gaps of 2.0 eV and 1.98 eV, which are comparable to that of the widely studied P3HT. Both copolymers also possess low-lying HOMO energy levels below −5.40 eV, which are expected to lead to high Voc values for their PSCs. The XRD analysis indicates their good molecular packing properties. Their photovoltaic properties were evaluated by using conventional devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al fabricated under different conditions. The PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices showed a relatively poor performance with PCEs of 2.83% and 4.13% with pure chlorobenzene (CB) solvent by adding 3 vol% DIO. The device performance was largely improved by using a co-solvent of CB and chloroform (CF) with increased PCEs of 3.76% and 5.01%. After employing the thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the PCEs of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices were finally increased to 5.04% and 6.35%. The gradually increased device performance would be attributed to the gradually optimized morphology of the related active blend films, which significantly induced a higher EQE response and hole mobility, giving rise to higher Jsc and FF values. Our results indicated that 1,2,5,6-naphthalenediimide is a promising acceptor block to build high-performance large band-gap copolymers for potential applications in single-junction and tandem PSCs in the future.

In the past two decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have attracted considerable attention due to their potential advantages of low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, and the capability to fabricate large area devices via low-temperature solution-processing techniques. Many research efforts in molecular design and device technique have been made to increase the photovoltaic parameters, including the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), which have rapidly increased the power conversion efficiency (PCE) values over 10% for single-junction cells and tandem cells. In search of high-performance photovoltaic polymers, the strategy of using donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated copolymers with alternating electron-rich blocks and electron-deficient blocks has been proved to be an effective way. Fine tunability of absorption, energy levels and carrier mobility could be realized by means of selecting different D and A building units.

D–A conjugated copolymers are divided into large band-gap (Eg > 1.8 eV), medium band-gap (Eg ≈ 1.6–1.8 eV), and low band-gap (Eg < 1.6 eV) polymers. Most research studies are focused on the development of medium band-gap and low band-gap copolymers, which show high PCEs in the range of 7–10% by incorporating strong electron-withdrawing units, such as benzothiadiazole (BT), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT), indigo (ID) and so on. However, large band-gap copolymers have received much less attention, which are also very important to fabricate tandem PSCs. Large band-gap copolymers with a relatively shorter-wavelength absorption are required to complement the spectrum of sunlight. On the other hand, large band-gap polymers usually have deep HOMO levels, which lead to high Voc values of their PSCs. In 2013, we reported two large band-gap copolymers (PBDTFBZO and PBDTFBZS) based on a fluorinated benzotriazole unit with low-lying energy levels and high mobilities. High PCEs of 7.74% and 9.40% were achieved for their single-junction PSCs and tandem PSCs, respectively. Other efficient large band-gap copolymers were also reported for photovoltaic applications, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), poly{4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-co-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione} (PM6), poly{dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione} (PDBT-T1). Although significant progress has been made, this type of large band-gap copolymer is still very rare for PSCs with respect to medium band-gap and low band-gap copolymers. The concept of tandem solar cells was a promising approach to realize high-performance PSCs, which had been predicted to possess a PCE up to 15%. Thus, new large band-gap copolymers with respectable photovoltaic properties are highly desirable.
Herein, we designed and synthesized new types of large band-gap copolymers for PSC applications, PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI (Fig. 1), containing benzodithiophene (BDT) and 1,2,5,6-naphthalenediimide (1,2,5,6-INDI) as the donor and acceptor blocks, respectively. The angular-shaped 1,2,5,6-INDI unit is a newly developed acceptor block for building D–A polymeric semiconductors with extraordinary carrier mobilities. For example, Gao et al. reported a series of 1,2,5,6-INDI-based polymers, which showed hole-dominated charge transport properties with a high mobility up to 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the photovoltaic properties of 1,2,5,6-INDI-based copolymers have been rarely investigated and their PCEs reported so far have been very low (below 1.5%). Compared to the commonly studied 1,4,5,8-INDI unit, 1,2,5,6-INDI exhibits a more coplanar skeleton and weaker electron-withdrawing properties, which makes it a potential candidate for constructing large band-gap copolymers. Benzodithiophene (BDT) was chosen because of its weak electron-donating nature and widely studied as the donor block for building highly efficient photovoltaic polymer donor materials. In particular for modified BDT with conjugated side chains, it has a two-dimensional (2D) conjugated skeleton, which can further lower the HOMO level, extend the absorption, and increase the whole device performance of their copolymers.PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI show large band-gaps of 2.10 and 1.98 eV, which are comparable to that of P3HT (2.0 eV). Single-junction PSCs based on these copolymers as donors and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor have been fabricated and evaluated. A high PCE of 6.35% was obtained from the PBDTT-INDI devices after thermal annealing (TA) treatment of the active films. The efficiency is the best value reported so far for single-junction PSCs based on conjugated copolymers with a large band-gap near 2.0 eV.

The synthetic routes to the monomers and the copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. Compound 6 was synthesized with a 62% yield by reacting compound 5 with 2-octyldodecan-1-amine in glacial acetic acid. Compound 7 was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of tributyl(2-thienyl)stannane and compound 6. Bromination of compound 7 with NBS in DMF/CHCl3 solution afforded monomer M with a yield of 91%. Finally, PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were prepared by the Stille coupling reaction and purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The molecular structures of the intermediates and the copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Both copolymers show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), toluene and dichlorobenzene (DCB). The molecular weights (Mns and Mws) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of the copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were estimated to be 61.1 kDa and 48.3 kDa, respectively. Both copolymers exhibited good thermal stability, which was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2a, the 5% decomposition temperatures of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were determined to be 360 °C and 450 °C, respectively. The results indicated that the introduction of 2D conjugated thienyl side chains onto the BDT skeleton would increase the thermal stability of the corresponding copolymers. The good thermal stability is adequately suitable for PSC fabrications and evaluations. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out in the range of 25 to 320 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The related DSC curves are provided in Fig. 2b. From the DSC heating to cooling traces, no glass transition was observed for both PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI. The results of molecular weights and the thermal analysis are listed in Table 1.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of copolymers PBDTA-NDI and PBDTT-NDI in chloroform solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding absorption data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 2. Both polymers show one distinct absorption characteristics in the range starting from 300 nm to 700 nm in CHCl3 solution. This absorption band comes from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the BDT unit and the INDI unit. The maximum peaks of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were located at about 500 nm and 515 nm, respectively. PBDTT-INDI with the conjugated alkylthienyl side chains shows a red-shifted absorption in contrast to PBDTA-INDI with alkyl side chains. The reason is attributed to the boosted ICT properties, originating from the larger delocalization of the BDT skeleton. The maximum molar absorption coefficient of PBDTT-INDI was 9.71 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which is also higher than that of PBDTA-INDI (7.41 × 105 M−1 cm−1). Obviously, the increase of absorption for PBDTT-INDI can be attributed to the introduction of the 2D conjugated side chains onto the BDT skeleton. Relative to their counterparts in the solution state, the peaks showed slight red-shifts for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI. This behavior is due to the slightly enhanced aggregation and intermolecular interactions between the conjugated polymer backbones in the solid state. Based on optical absorption edges of the film spectra, the optical band-gaps of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were determined to be 2.00 and 1.98 eV, respectively. As expected, the copolymers have large band-gaps around 2.0 eV, which are comparable to that of P3HT.

The electrochemical properties of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV experiments were performed in a three-electrode cell, using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4) as the supporting electrolyte in anhydrous acetonitrile. A platinum plate coated with a thin film of the copolymer, a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ system to be 4.34 eV according to the previous methods. As shown in Fig. 4, the onset oxidation potentials of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI appeared at 1.07 V and 1.13 V, corresponding to HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.41 eV and −5.47 eV for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI, respectively. The low-lying HOMO levels of these two polymers should be beneficial to their chemical stability under ambient conditions. On the other hand, the high Vocs of their PSCs could be expected due to the deep HOMO level because the Voc value is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. The introduction of 2D thienyl side chains onto the BDT skeleton would reduce the HOMO level by about −0.06 eV. Also from the onset reduction potentials, the LUMO levels of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were determined to be −3.29 eV and −3.46 eV, respectively. Thus, the electrochemical band-gaps of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were calculated to be about 2.12 eV and 2.01 eV. This trend is in agreement with that of the estimated optical band-gaps. Fig. 4b shows the HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer donors and PC71BM used in this work. As shown in Fig. 4b, the LUMO gaps of 0.45–0.75 eV and HOMO gaps of 0.50–0.60 eV between the copolymers and PC71BM afford a sufficient driving force for efficient exciton dissociation at the D–A interface, ensuring energetically favorable electron transfer to overcome the binding energy of the intrachain exciton. The corresponding electrochemical data of these copolymers are also summarized in Table 2.


In order to investigate deeply the effect of the 2D side chains on the BDT skeleton, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed. DFT calculations were performed on the model monomers with three repeated D–A units to verify stationary points as stable states for the optimized conformations and single-point energies, at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. To simplify the calculations, three repeat units were chosen as the model compounds for simulation of the three copolymers. The actual long alkyl groups are replaced by methyl groups to accelerate the calculations without impacting the results. As shown in Fig. 5, these two copolymers show similar distributions for both HOMOs and LUMOs. It can be seen clearly from the optimized molecular backbones that both polymers displayed a linear molecular chain, which would enable them to form an ordered organization, giving rise to a high carrier mobility. The HOMOs feature extended delocalization along the electron-rich skeletons of BDT and thiophene units. However, the LUMOs are mainly located on the electron-deficient skeletons of INDI units. The locations of the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 transfer from the middle part to the side parts, implying an obvious charge-transfer process between the BDT segments and NDI segments when the copolymers absorb enough energy. The variation tendency of the calculated energy levels and energy gaps are in satisfactory agreement with those estimated from UV-vis absorptions and CV experiments.


The molecular packing properties of the copolymers were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As shown in Fig. 6, the pristine films of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI exhibit two similar diffraction peaks. The first peak is located at 2θ of 3.11° and 3.25° for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI, respectively, which is assignable to a lamellar packing with the related d-spacing (dl) distances of 28.37 Å and 27.15 Å. The relatively smaller dl distance and stronger diffraction peak of the PBDTT-INDI film indicate its more ordered and closer packing properties than the PBDTA-INDI film. The second peaks reflect the π–π stacking distances between the polymer backbones, which are located at 2θ of 23.63° and 24.00°, featuring the π-stacking (dπ) distances of 3.76 Å and 3.70 Å for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI, respectively. Compared with PBDTA-INDI, after introducing the alkylthienyl group instead of the alkyl group, PBDTT-IND showed a shorter π–π stacking distance, which may be attributed to the more planar structure of the PBDTT-INDI backbone. The XRD result indicates that replacing the alkoxyl with alkylthienyl side chains makes BDT–NDI copolymers favor a more planar geometry, inducing an enhanced carrier mobility.


The photovoltaic properties of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were investigated by PSCs with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. An optimized device performance was obtained by varying copolymer:PC71BM weight ratios, the type of processing solvent, the thickness of the active layer, the usage of processing additives, and the thermal annealing temperature. The optimized weight ratio of copolymer to PC71BM was found to be 1:1.5. 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the blend solution to optimize the morphology of the active film. Thermal annealing treatment was carried out on a digitally controlled hotplate at various temperatures, and 70 °C was found to be the best annealing condition for this material system. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSC devices are provided in Fig. 7, and the corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 3.

Using pure chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvent with 3 vol% DIO additive, the PBDTA-INDI device exhibited a PCE of 2.83% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 6.90 mA cm−2, and an FF of 44.0% (Fig. 7a). Under the same experimental conditions, the PBDTT-INDI device showed much higher performance with a PCE of 4.13%, which would be attributed to the improved Voc of 0.98 V, Jsc of 8.98 mA cm−2, and FF of 47.1%. The increased Voc of the PBDTT-INDI device is 0.03 V higher than that of the PBDTA-INDI device, originating from the relatively lower-lying HOMO level of PBDTT-INDI, as measured from the CV experiments. The Jsc values are determined by many factors, including the absorption ability and carrier mobility of the active layer. The wider and stronger absorption of PBDTT-INDI (see UV-vis section) contributes to the better light-harvest ability of the PBDTT-INDI-based active film, giving rise to a Jsc improvement of the PBDTT-INDI device. On the other hand, the hole mobilities of the active films were measured from their hole-only devices by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. 8 shows the J–V curves of the hole-only devices of the active blend films. The PBDTT-INDI blend film possessed a hole mobility of 7.55 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 4). However, the PBDTT-INDI blend film exhibited a little higher hole mobility of 8.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, the better absorption and higher carrier mobility guarantee the PBDTT-INDI device to achieve a larger Jsc value. The increased Jsc value could also be confirmed by EQE measurements. As shown in Fig. 7b, the PBDTT-INDI device exhibits a wider EQE response and a higher EQE maximum value of about 60% in the range of 300–700 nm than that (only 43%) of the PBDTA-IND device. Since the absorption of the active layer is determined by the donor material in polymer:PC71BM based PSCs, this improvement of EQE can be attributed to the better absorption of PBDTT-INDI as mentioned above.

When using a binary co-solvent of CB and CF (1:1, v/v, with 3% DIO), the device performance improved greatly for both copolymers in comparison with that just using pure CB solvent. As shown in Fig. 7a and Table 3, the PCEs increased from 2.83% to 3.76% for the PBDTA-INDI device, and from 4.13% to 5.01% for the PBDTT-INDI device, respectively. After checking the photovoltaic parameters, it is easy to find that the PCE increases were due to the significant improvements of Jsc and FF, while the Voc was kept almost the same or decreased a little. The Jsc values increased from 6.90 and 8.98 mA cm−2 to 7.39 and 9.06 mA cm−2 for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices, respectively, which was also confirmed by their EQE curves. As shown in Fig. 7b, the usage of the co-solvent enhanced their EQE responses and increased the related EQE maximum values up to 50% and 60%. On the other hand, the hole mobility of the blend film has increased by about one order of magnitude. Also from the SCLC results, PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI blend films exhibited the higher hole mobilities of 1.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In addition, the aforementioned change of fabrication conditions improved the surface morphologies of their blend films, which were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM topography and phase images are provided in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, the blend films with pure CB solvent have a rough surface, featuring a larger domain size more than 100 nm. The average surface roughness values (Ras) measured from the topographic images are 10.0 and 8.9 nm for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI blend films, respectively. However, if the blend films were spin-coated from their co-solvent solution, the surfaces would be much smoother with smaller Ra values of 3.42 and 2.41 nm for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI blend films. The morphologies also showed bicontinuous networks, indicating a good miscibility between the copolymer and PC71BM under this fabrication condition with a processing co-solvent. The improved surface morphologies of both blend films can explain well the increase of the FF value after using the co-solvent of CB and CF. Thus, it is reasonable that the FF values of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices were largely increased from 44.0% to 54.6% and 47.1% to 57.6%, respectively.
In order to further increase the device performance, the prepared active layers from the binary co-solvent were then treated by a thermal annealing (TA) method. The TA treatment was carried out at various temperatures, and 70 °C was found to be the best temperature condition for the blend system in this work. As shown in Fig. 7a and Table 3, an obvious increase of PCE after a TA treatment has been achieved for both PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices. PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices exhibited the highest PCEs of 5.04% and 6.35%, respectively. The PCE of 6.35% is the best value reported so far for single-junction PSCs based on conjugated copolymers with a large band-gap near 2.0 eV. The TA treatment led to significant improvement in both Jsc and FF; however, the Voc maintained the same level. When using the TA method, the Jsc values were further improved from 7.39 to 8.51 mA cm−2 and 9.06 to 10.26 mA cm−2 for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices, respectively. The EQE responses in Fig. 7b have verified these enhancements. As shown in Fig. 7b, the optical responses have increased to 57% and 69% for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices after the TA processes. Furthermore, the SCLC results (Fig. 8) indicated that the hole mobilities of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices also have been improved to 1.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Apparently, the increased EQE response and hole mobility would be responsible for the above Jsc enhancement. Beside the Jscs, the FFs of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices were also increased from 54.6% and 57.6% up to 63.7% and 64.5%. To clarify these increases, we checked the morphological changes of the blend films after the TA processes by AFM. As shown in Fig. 9, the TA treatment would make the surface morphology become much smoother. The Ra values of PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI blend films were further decreased to 0.89 nm and 0.79 nm. The far more important change was that the blend films had generated clear and fine nanophase separation with a domain size of 30–50 nm. The AFM results clearly supported the enhancements of the FF values when using the TA treatments.

In summary, we designed and synthesized new types of large band-gap copolymers PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI, based on a 1,2,5,6-naphthalenediimide (1,2,5,6-INDI) acceptor unit for efficient single-junction polymer solar cells (PSCs). These copolymers show a band-gap of about 2.0 eV, which is comparable to that of the commonly studied P3HT. PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI also possess low-lying HOMO energy levels below −5.40 eV, implying a high Voc value for their PSCs. The XRD results showed that both copolymers had good molecular stacking properties. The solar cell devices based on PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI were fabricated and characterized under different processing conditions. PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices using pure chlorobenzene (CB) by adding 3 vol% DIO showed a relatively poor performance with PCEs of 2.83% and 4.13%. To optimize the morphology of the corresponding active films, a co-solvent of CB and chloroform (CF) and thermal annealing (TA) were employed to fabricate PSCs. The fine nanophase separation was gradually improved, which increased the Jsc and FF values of the related devices, giving rise to largely increased PCEs. PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices exhibited enhanced PCEs of 3.76% and 5.01% after using the co-solvent. When processing with a TA treatment, the PCEs were finally increased to 5.04% and 6.35% for PBDTA-INDI and PBDTT-INDI devices, respectively. The PCE value of 6.35% is the best efficiency reported so far for single-junction PSCs based on these conjugated copolymers with a large band-gap near 2.0 eV. Our work indicates that 1,2,5,6-INDI is a promising acceptor block to build efficient large band-gap copolymers as donor materials for usage in single-junction and tandem PSCs in the future. We believe much higher efficiency can be achieved for this material system by further optimizing the morphology of the related blend layer to an ideal level through other approaches.
