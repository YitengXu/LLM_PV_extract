Dopant-free poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b] thiophene)-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C) polymer is used as hole transporting material (HTM) in electron transporting material (ETM) free planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The devices with a PBDTTT-C HTM show higher power conversion efficiency (PCE = 9.95%) than the devices with a P3HT HTM (PCE = 6.17%) with enhanced short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) in a simple device configuration (ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/PBDTTT-C/MoO3/Ag), due to the suitable energy level, better carrier mobility and lower interfacial charge recombination.

Organometal halide perovskite (MAPbX3 or FAPbX3) based solar cells have received great attention because of their remarkably high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Various kinds of perovskite solar cell (PSC) device configurations are used to optimize device performances, including mesoporous metal oxide-based PSCs, mesosuperstructured PSCs and planar heterojunction PSCs. The PCE of PSCs based on different structures has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 20.1%. Recently, planar PSCs have become popular because of their simple fabrication process, cost-effective and easy industrialization production. Generally, a typical planar device is composed of an n-type metal oxide (e.g. TiO2, ZnO) electron transport material (ETM) coated on transparent conductive oxide (FTO or ITO) glass substrates, organometal halide perovskite active layers, hole transport materials (HTMs) and metal back electrodes. In other words, it is based on the structure of ITO or FTO/ETM/perovskite/HTM/metal electrode strurcture. The most used ETM n-type metal oxides (e.g. TiO2, ZnO) need high-temperature thermal treatment (normally over 450 °C) to crystallize, which restricts them from being used in devices with the flexible polymer substrates. Recently, a compact layer free PSC with 13.5% PCE has been reported. This device configuration is a good choice of low temperature-processed low-cost PSCs.

Despite the rapid development of different types of device structures for improving PCE, the evolution of HTMs is relatively limited. In particular, spiro-OMeTAD is the model material in the small molecular HTM, and P3HT (Fig. 1b) is the most used polymer HTM. Spiro-OMeTAD was synthesized by a tedious route which made future commercialization difficult. Furthermore, it needs a dopant to improve its transport performance, which complicates the device fabrication process. PSCs employing P3HT as the HTM showed moderate performances due to its low carrier mobility and the mismatch energy level. Therefore, a new HTM with higher carrier mobility, good solubility for solution processing and a compatible highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to perovskites is needed for high performance low cost PSCs.
In this work, we found that the well-known semiconducting benzodithiophene polymer, poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C, Fig. 1a) with good stability, high charge-carrier mobility, and a suitable HOMO energy level, is a potential HTM for PSCs. Simple planar devices were fabricated with the ITO/perovskite/PBDTTT-C (or P3HT control devices)/MoO3/Ag structure (Fig. 1d). The energy level diagram of materials used in the devices is shown in Fig. 1c, which values are obtained from the literature. Without the inorganic ETM (e.g. TiO2, ZnO), the PSCs can be processed at only 100 °C in this work. The PSCs with the PBDTTT-C HTM (ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/PBDTTT-C/MoO3/Ag) show a higher power conversion efficiency (9.95%) than the devices based on P3HT (6.17%). This work shows that PBDTTT-C is a promising HTM for low cost solution-processed PSCs. The proof of concept device with TiO2 and P3HT as an ETM and a HTM (configuration: FTO/c-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/MoO3/Ag) shows a PCE of around 7.52% (Fig. S1, ESI).

Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3/PBDTTT-C, and CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT thin films on ITO glass substrates. Pristine CH3NH3PbI3 film shows a wide absorption in the range of 300–800 nm which is consistent with the previous report. For CH3NH3PbI3/PBDTTT-C or CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT thin film, the enhanced absorption at 690 or 450–600 nm, compared with the CH3NH3PbI3 pristine film, is due to the absorption of the PBDTTT-C or P3HT polymer.

Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with different HTMs (P3HT or PBDTTT-C) under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The device performance parameters of the optimized PSCs are depicted in Table 1. The photovoltaic performance of the devices with PBDTTT-C completely surpasses that of P3HT, including the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), the fill factor (FF) and PCE. For PSCs with the P3HT HTM, a PCE of 6.17% was achieved with a JSC of 15.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.768 V and an FF of 51.59%. When PBDTTT-C was used as the HTM, the PCE was increased to 9.95% with a JSC of 17.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.868 V, and an FF of 64.83%. Moreover, the performance of devices with different thicknesses of PBDTTT-C is also given in Table S1 (ESI). Upon increasing film thinness, the photovoltaic performance firstly increases and reaches the optimal value at 32.11 nm (800 r s−1) and then decreases. In addition, a device based on the PBDTTT-C HTM shows less hysteresis than that with the P3HT HTM (Fig. 3a). Meantime, the reproducibility of the PSCs based on the PBDTTT-C HTM is better than the devices with the P3HT HTM (Table 1).

To clarify if the PBDTTT-C or P3HT layer contributes to the PSC photocurrent, the UV-visible absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3/PBDTTT-C and CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT thin films (Fig. 2) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PSC devices (Fig. 3b) were analyzed.
The EQE spectra of the devices with P3HT and PBDTTT-C HTMs are shown in Fig. 3b. The EQE spectra of the devices are closely consistent with the absorption spectra of the perovskite. Despite the fact that the absorption peaks of P3HT and PBDTTT-C are observed at about 490 nm and 690 nm respectively in the UV-vis absorption spectra, these HTM layers do not contribute to the photocurrent. Furthermore, a similar shape of the EQE spectra for all the devices indicates that light absorption by these polymers is negligible and the role of these polymers is limited to the hole transport. The device with PBDTTT-C yields a relatively high EQE value in most of the wavelength than that with P3HT, which agrees with the higher JSC of the devices with the PBDTTT-C HTM obtained from J–V curves.
Therefore, there must be other important factors that contribute to the much better performance of devices with the PBDTTT-C HTM compared with the devices based on P3HT. When light irradiates on the devices, the CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer will absorb photons to produce charges. Then the charges will move to the two interfaces ITO/CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/HTM. After that, electrons are collected by ITO, and holes directly flow to the HOMOs of HTMs, and then collected by a Ag anode. Since the HOMO level of PBDTTT-C (−5.12 eV) is deeper than that of P3HT (−4.76 eV) and is much closer to the HOMO of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.4 eV), as shown in Fig. 1c, the PBDTTT-C layer provides a better energy level matching. So holes can more easily move to the Ag anode. Simultaneously, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PBDTTT-C (−3.35 eV), which is also deeper than that of P3HT, prevents electrons transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to the Ag electrode. Therefore, the devices with PBDTTT-C HTM could exhibit higher charge collection efficiencies on both electrodes than those devices based on P3HT.
Subsequently, the interfacial charge recombination is an important energy loss mechanism in solar cells, and this may significantly affects the JSC. For this reason, we measured the dark J–V characteristics (Fig. 4a) and the photoluminescence (PL) (Fig. 4b). As shown in Fig. 4a, the devices with PBDTTT-C have a lower dark current density in contrast to the devices with P3HT, which indicates that the back charge recombination for the device based on PBDTTT-C is suppressed much more effectively. In other words, using PBDTTT-C as the HTM could effectively suppress the possibility of charge recombination before they reach the electrode. This could contribute to the high JSC value. As shown in Fig. 4b, the PL peak of CH3NH3PbI3 is at 758 nm, which is consistent with the previous report. The PL of CH3NH3PbI3/PBDTTT-C film is quenched more effectively than CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT film, which could mean that the interfacial charge recombination in CH3NH3PbI3/PBDTTT-C based devices is lower than that in CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT based devices. Further work utilizing time-resolved photoluminescence measurements to analyze charge extraction is underway.
The origin of VOC in PSCs is partly related to the difference between the LUMO level of perovskites and the HOMO of HTMs. From Fig. 1c, it can be easily found that PBDTTT-C has a HOMO energy level of −5.12 eV, which is deeper than that of P3HT (−4.76 eV), resulting in a higher VOC of devices based on PBDTTT-C. Moreover, the greatly reduced bimolecular recombination plays a significant role on improving the VOC. The lower dark current of the devices with PBDTTT-C as the HTM illustrated in Fig. 4a may indicate that the less bimolecular recombination is good for higher VOC.
Last but not least, the difference in the FF can be understand from three aspects. Firstly, according to Burschka et al. who demonstrate that the carrier mobility of an organic semiconductor is important for achieving a high photovoltaic performance of the device, the holes can be more easily transported using PBDTTT-C as the HTM because the hole mobility of PBDTTT-C (2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s −1) is higher than that of P3HT (5.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Secondly, the PBDTTT-C film between the Ag anode and the perovskite layer provides a better energy level matching due to the well-aligned HOMO of PBDTTT-C with the HOMO of CH3NH3PbI3. Thirdly, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) have a great influence on the FF. The higher Rsh and the lower Rs enabled a larger FF. As shown in Table 1, the Rs value of PBDTTT-C based devices is lower than that with P3HT, meanwhile the Rsh value is higher. Moreover, the surface morphology also affects the device performances. In Fig. 5, the surface of bare perovskites was rough (RMS = 9.8 nm). PBDTTT-C coated perovskite film has a root mean square (RMS) value of 4.35 nm, whereas P3HT based film shows an RMS value of 4.68 nm. After being modified with a HTM polymer, the perovskite surface became smooth. All these aspects could lead to the higher FF of the devices based on PBDTTT-C.
In conclusion, the dopant-free PBDTTT-C HTM was introduced to a simple planar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell, which did not contain ETMs. Due to the compatible HOMO energy level, a relatively high hole mobility and good surface morphology, the low temperature processed PBDTTT-C HTM based ETM free PSC device shows a substantial increase in PCE, JSC, VOC and FF, compared with the reference device based on P3HT.
