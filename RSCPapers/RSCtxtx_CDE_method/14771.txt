Thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes with two diethylaminophenyl groups as strong donors demonstrated near-infrared (NIR) absorption (λmax: 783–812 nm, ε: 119500–145900) and fluorescence (Fmax: 862–916 nm, Φf: 0.02–0.12) in dichloromethane. When applied to dye-sensitised solar cells, these dyes exhibited a panchromatic incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) response from 400 to 850 nm, with the onset of the IPCE response at ∼950 nm.

Because of environmental issues and the exhaustion of petroleum resources, solar cells have attracted considerable attention as renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources. Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) have many advantages over conventional silicon cells, such as low production costs, flexibility, and multiple colour choices. Ruthenium–pyridyl complexes are one of the candidates of photosensitisers for DSSCs. Ruthenium–pyridyl complexes with a solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (η) exceeding 11% have been reported. However, Ru complexes have some disadvantages, such as the high cost of the rare metal Ru and low molar extinction coefficients. Therefore, ruthenium-free organic dyes have been aggressively investigated for use as photosensitisers. Efficient ruthenium-free organic dyes such as porphyrin, indoline, perylene, tetrathienoacene, phenothiazine, and others have been reported. In particular, zinc porphyrin complex (SM315: η = 13%), indoline-based dye (YA422: η = 10.65%), perylene-based dye (C275: η = 12.5%), tetrathienoacene-based dye (TTAR-b8: η = 11.18%), oligothiophene with alkoxysilyl-anchor (ADEKA-1: η = 12.8%), and 9,19-dihydrobenzo[1′,10′]phenanthro[3′,4′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]benzo[1,10]phenanthro[3,4-d]thiophene-based dye (R6: η = 12.6%) show remarkable performances. Squarine, cyanine, and phthalocyanine have been reported as near-infrared (NIR) photosensitisers; however, photoelectric conversion in the NIR region is still limited. The development of an efficient NIR photosensitiser is a critical, challenging problem that must be solved.

Boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) is one of the most prominent fluorescent dyes. Its absorption wavelength can be controlled from the visible to the NIR region by structural modification. Because of their excellent absorption properties and easily controllable molecular structures, BODIPY dyes have also attracted considerable research interest for application as photosensitisers in DSSCs. The application of BODIPY dyes to DSSCs was first reported by Fukuzumi and coworkers in 2005. However, the energy conversion efficiency (η) was very low (0.13–0.16). There have been many attempts to modify the structure of BODIPY photosensitizers, which can be roughly divided into two types: 3,5,8-modified BODIPY dyes (vertical design) and 2,6-modified BODIPY dyes (horizontal design). Ziessel and coworkers reported that 3,5,8-modified BODIPY dye having two 3-(2-methoxyethoxy)prop-1-ynyl groups on the boron atom exhibited a high η value (5.75%) along with a high incident photon-to-current conversion (IPCE) efficiency response of over 60% from 560 to 760 nm. In 2,6-modified BODIPY dyes, MPBTTCA showed a higher η value (6.4%). In addition, benzene-fused BODIPY dye showed a high η value (6.06%) as well as a high IPCE response of over 70% in the long-wavelength region from 600 to 720 nm, with the onset of the IPCE response at ∼800 nm. Moreover, benzene-fused BODIPY dye conjugated with a phenothiazine moiety as an anchoring group showed the highest η value (7.69%). Therefore, BODIPY dyes are good candidates for use as efficient NIR photosensitisers for DSSCs. However, the development of a BODIPY dye with efficient photoelectric conversion at wavelengths greater than 800 nm is an intractable problem because adjusting the HOMO and LUMO energy levels is very difficult.
On the other hand, annelation of an aromatic ring to the BODIPY core is an efficient strategy to achieve a redshift of the absorption maximum. Since furan-fused BODIPY dyes were firstly reported by Umezawa and coworkers in 2008, they have received attention for their application in NIR fluorescence probes and electron donors for organic solar cells (OSCs). Furthermore, thiophene-fused BODIPY and azaBODIPY dyes have been used as NIR photosensitisers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and NIR absorbing dyes. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the application of thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes as photosensitisers in DSSCs. In this paper, we report the application of (D)2–π–A type (vertical design) thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes with strong donor (D) groups for use as NIR photosensitisers in DSSCs.

The previously reported compound 2 was synthesised in three steps from ethyl bromoacetate (Scheme 1). Ethyl azidoacetate was obtained through the reaction of sodium azide and ethyl bromoacetate. Aldol-type condensation of ethyl azidoacetate with 5-bromo-2-formylthiophene in the presence of sodium ethoxide gave (Z)-ethyl 2-azido-3-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)acrylate (1). Intramolecular annulation of the nitrene intermediate obtained by heating azido 1 led to the formation of 2-bromo-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylate (2). The Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between bromothienopyrrole 2 and 4-(diethylamino)phenylboronic acid in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 afforded ethyl 2-(4′-diethylaminophenyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylate (3) in 87% yield. Heating an ethylene glycol solution of 3 in the presence of potassium hydroxide resulted in hydrolysis, followed by decarboxylation, to give 2-(4′-diethylaminophenyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole (4) in 69% yield. The Friedel–Crafts reaction of 4 with 4-formylbenzoic acid gave the corresponding dipyrrolemethane. Without isolation, dipyrrolemethane was oxidised with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) to give the corresponding dipyrromethene. This was followed by boron complexation using triethylamine and boron trifluoride diethyl ether complex to give thiophene-fused BODIPY dye 5 in 16% yield. A similar procedure using 5-formyl-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid gave thiophene-fused BODIPY dye 6 in 31% yield.


The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of BODIPY dyes 5 and 6 in dichloromethane were recorded (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, both BODIPY dyes showed absorption in the NIR region; the absorption maximum (λmax) of thiophene derivative 6 (813 nm) was red-shifted compared with that of phenylene derivative 5 (783 nm) (Table 1). In the absorption spectra of 5 and 6, not only the first absorption band but also the second (5: λmax = 565 nm, 6: λmax = 586 nm) and third (5: λmax = 447 nm, 6: λmax = 456 nm) absorption bands were observed. Such multiple absorption bands are advantageous for wide-range solar light harvesting, which leads to panchromatic sensitisation in DSSCs. These dyes also showed high molar extinction coefficients (ε: 5: 145900, 6: 119500).

BODIPY dyes 5 and 6 exhibited NIR fluorescence in dichloromethane (Fig. 1b). The fluorescence maximum (Fmax) of 6 (916 nm) was also bathochromically shifted compared with that of 5 (862 nm). The fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) of 5 (0.12) was slightly higher than that of 6 (0.02). Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to obtain the fluorescence lifetimes (τs) of these dyes. The fluorescence decays were fitted to a monoexponential function (5: χ2 = 1.10, 6: χ2 = 1.07) (Fig. S1, ESI). The τs values of 5 and 6 were 1.24 and 0.26 ns, respectively (Table 1). The radiative rate constant (kf) of 5 (0.97 × 108 s−1) was comparable to that of 6 (0.77 × 108 s−1). However, the non-radiative rate constant (knr) of 6 (37.7 × 108 s−1) was significantly higher than that of 5 (7.1 × 108 s−1). Thus, the main reason for the lower Φf value of 6 was the susceptibility to non-radiative processes. According to the energy gap law, knr decreases exponentially with increasing energy gap. Thus, one of the reasons for the smaller knr value of 5 is the higher energy gap (5: 1.51 eV, 6: 1.44 eV). Additionally, thiophene derivative 6 is expected to easily lead to intersystem crossing (ISC) compared to phenylene derivative 5 because of the heavy atom effect of the sulfur atom in the meso-positioned thiophene moiety. Therefore, the smaller knr value of 5 is probably due to both the higher energy gap and suppressed ICT of 5.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package for a deeper insight into the absorption properties of the synthesised BODIPY dyes. Geometry optimisation and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were performed using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method in a vacuum. Thiophene derivative 6 tended to have a lower energy level compared with that of phenylene derivative 5, and the decrease of the LUMO level was especially noticeable (5: −2.63 eV, 6: −2.74 eV) (Fig. 2). The calculated λmax, the main orbital transition, and the oscillator strength (f) of these dyes are shown in Table 2. The TDDFT results indicated that the experimentally observed first absorption bands of 5 (783 nm) and 6 (813 nm) are attributed to the S0 → S1 transition and are mainly due to the HOMO–LUMO transitions. The HOMO–LUMO transitions of 5 and 6 were intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions from the diethylaminophenyl moiety (donor) to the anchor (acceptor) moiety (Fig. 2). Therefore, thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes 5 and 6 appeared to be effective for electron injection from the excited state to the TiO2 conduction band. The observed second (5: 565 nm, 6: 586 nm) and third (5: 447 nm, 6: 456 nm) absorption bands were mainly attributed to the HOMO−1–LUMO and HOMO–LUMO+1 transitions, respectively. The calculated λmax values were in good agreement with the experimental values. A spectral red shift of 6 compared with 5 is suggested. In the optimised structure, the dihedral angles between the BODIPY core and the meso-aryl moieties of 5 and 6 were 55.8° and 48.9°, respectively. Therefore, the red-shifted λmax of 6 was probably due to the smaller dihedral angle, which led to more effective π-conjugation and ICT transition.

The cyclic voltammograms of 5 and 6 were measured in acetonitrile (Fig. 3). BODIPY dye 5 underwent two successive one-electron oxidation processes. The first and second half-wave potentials for oxidation (E1/2 (ox)) were 0.12 and 0.26 (vs. Fc/Fc+), respectively. In acetonitrile, the conversion of E1/2 (vs. Fc/Fc+) to E1/2 (vs. NHE) is known to be as follows: E1/2 (vs. NHE) = E1/2 (vs. Fc/Fc+) + 0.63 V. Therefore, the first and second E1/2 (ox) values of 5 were estimated to be 0.75 and 0.89 V (vs. NHE) (Table 3). Similarly, the E1/2 (ox) values of 6 were determined to be 0.77 and 0.89 V (vs. NHE). Therefore, the first Eox values corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of 5 (0.75 vs. NHE) and 6 (0.77 vs. NHE) were more positive than the I−/I3− redox potential (0.4 vs. NHE), indicating that regeneration of the oxidised dyes by electron transfer from the I−/I3− redox in the electrolyte is considered to be thermodynamically possible (Fig. 4).

The LUMO energy level (ELUMO) was obtained by subtracting the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) (5: 823 nm, 1.51 eV, 6: 861 nm, 1.44 eV) determined by the intersection of the normalised absorption and fluorescence spectra in dichloromethane from the corresponding E1/2 (ox) values (Fig. S2, ESI). Thus, the ELUMO values of 5 and 6 were estimated to be −0.76 and −0.67 V vs. NHE, respectively. Because the ELUMO values of 5 and 6 were more negatively shifted compared with that of the conduction band level of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), electron transfer from the excited BODIPY dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 is expected to be thermodynamically allowed.

The photovoltaic characteristics of 5 and 6 as sensitisers were evaluated in DSSCs comprising a TiO2 photoelectrode (transparent layer: 8 μm, scattering layer: 4 μm), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 5: 40 equiv., 6: 60 equiv.) as a co-adsorbent in acetonitrile/t-butyl alcohol (v:v = 1:1), a Pt-sputtered FTO glass plate, and a 3-methoxypropionitrile solution containing I2 (0.1 M), LiI (2.0 M), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII, 0.6 M), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) as a liquid electrolyte. For the sake of comparison, the well-known photosensitizer D149 was evaluated under the same fabrication conditions (Fig. S3, ESI and Table 4). The IPCE spectra of 5 and 6 are shown in Fig. 5. The IPCE values of 5 and 6 were higher than 5% in the range of 400 to 850 nm, and the onsets of the IPCE response were at ∼950 nm. The maximum IPCE of 6 (12.3% at 810 nm) was red-shifted and lower than that of 5 (18.1% at 790 nm) (Table 4).

The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of BODIPY dyes adsorbed on an 8 μm TiO2 film with CDCA are shown in Fig. 6. The λmax values on the TiO2 film (5: 738 nm, 6: 765 nm) were blue-shifted and the spectra were broadened compared with the corresponding λmax values in dichloromethane (5: 783 nm, 6: 812 nm), which was probably due to the formation of aggregates and the interaction of the anchor group with the TiO2 surface. The shape of the IPCE spectra was consistent with that of the absorption spectra in dichloromethane and on the TiO2 film. Compared to the absorption spectra, the IPCE response in the shorter-wavelength region (around 550 nm) was higher than that in the longer-wavelength region (∼800 nm), which was due to the effect of a scattering layer.
The lower IPCE response of 6 may be due to the positively shifted ELUMO (5: −0.76 V vs. NHE, 6: −0.67 V vs. NHE), which makes it difficult to transfer electrons from the excited BODIPY dyes to the conduction band of TiO2. The I–V curves of 5 and 6 are shown in Fig. 7. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5 (4.98 mA cm−2) was higher than that of 6 (3.96 mA cm−2) because of the significantly higher IPCE response. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of 5 (Voc: 0.431 V, FF: 0.65) and 6 (Voc: 0.435 V, FF: 0.65) were almost the same. Therefore, phenylene derivative 5 showed a higher power conversion efficiency (η; 1.40%) than thiophene derivative 6 (1.12%) due to the higher Jsc.
The structural planarity of BODIPY dyes is known to often lead to severe dye aggregates on TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces, which facilitates the electron recombination. Thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes 5 and 6 have a highly planar geometry compared to common BODIPY dyes. Therefore, one of the reasons for the relatively low performances of 5 and 6 is considered to be the formation of aggregates. Introduction of bulky alkyl groups into BODIPY dye is a good strategy to suppress dye aggregates. Additionally, recently, we have reported that optimization of co-adsorbents can efficiently prevent the aggregation formation of dyes and significantly improve the performance of DSSCs. We expect that introduction of bulky alkyl groups and optimization of co-adsorbents will improve the DSSC performance of thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes.

Thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes with two diethylaminophenyl groups as strong donor groups, a phenylene or thiophene group as a spacer group, and carboxylic groups as anchor and acceptor groups were synthesised, and their absorption, fluorescence, and application to dye-sensitised solar cells were studied. Thiophene derivative 6 showed a red-shifted λmax compared with the corresponding phenylene derivative 5 due to the smaller dihedral angle between the BODIPY core and the meso-substituted spacer group, which led to the extension of π-conjugation and promoted the ICT transition. Thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes exhibited fluorescence in the NIR region. Thiophene-fused BODIPY dyes used as sensitisers for DSSCs showed IPCE responses in the range of 400 to 850 nm. The maximum IPCE values for 5 and 6 were 18.1% at 790 nm and 12.3% at 810 nm, respectively. Because of the higher IPCE response, 5 showed higher Jsc and η values compared with those of 6.

Eight drops of trifluoroacetic acid were added to a solution of 4 (99.9 mg, 0.369 mmol) and 4-formylbenzoic acid (27.8 mg, 0.185 mmol) in dichloromethane (50 mL), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. A dichloromethane solution of DDQ (42.0 mg, 0.185 mmol) was added to the solution. After stirring for 2 h at room temperature, triethylamine (0.6 mL, 4.3 mmol) and boron trifluoride diethyl ether complex (0.6 mL, 4.7 mmol) were added and stirred for 1 day. Then, water was poured into the reaction mixture. The solution was washed with water, extracted with dichloromethane, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated.

Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated according to the previously reported method of Ito et al. FTO (F-doped tin oxide; 4 mm thickness, 13 Ω □−1, Nippon Sheet Glass) glass substrates were washed for 20 min each with an aqueous detergent solution, distilled water, and ethanol using an ultrasonic bath. The FTO glass substrate was immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then washed with distilled water and ethanol. A commercial TiO2 paste (PST-18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd.) was deposited onto the FTO glass substrate by the squeegee method using mending tape (4 μm thickness) twice to obtain an 8 μm transparent TiO2 film. After drying the FTO glass substrate at 130 °C in air for 15 min, a commercial TiO2 paste (PST-400C, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd.) was deposited once to obtain a 4 μm scattering layer. The resulting substrate was sintered at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sintered TiO2 film was immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then washed with distilled water and ethanol. After drying, the TiO2 film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min to obtain a mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode consisting of a transparent layer (8 μm thickness) and a scattering layer (4 μm thickness). The TiO2 electrode was then immersed in a solution of thiophene-fused BODIPY dye (0.1 mM) and chenodeoxycholic acid (5:4 mM, 6:6 mM) in acetonitrile/t-butyl alcohol (v:v = 1:1). The dye adsorption was performed at 10 °C for 1 h, and the electrode was then washed with ethanol to remove any non-adsorbed dye, and dried. The dye-coated TiO2 electrode and the Pt-sputtered FTO glass counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell (active area: 5 mm × 4 mm). An electrolyte composed of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.1 M I2, and 2.0 M LiI in a 3-methoxypropionitrile was added to the cell. After assembling the cell, silver paint was applied to the edges of the TiO2 photoelectrode and the counter electrode of the cells to reduce the series resistance. The I–V curves of the cells were measured under the irradiation of simulated sunlight at AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) generated by a Bunko-Keiki CEP-2000 system. A mask was used to regulate the active area to 0.2 cm2. IPCE spectra were recorded using a Bunko-Keiki CEP-2000 system under monochromatic light illumination.
