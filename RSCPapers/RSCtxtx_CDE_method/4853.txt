Aqueous solution deposition of metal chalcogenide semiconductor thin films is considered a green and low-cost approach. However, it is hard to find a general aqueous solution approach to deposit various kinds of high-quality metal sulfide thin films. Here, we describe a green and robust ammonium thioglycolate aqueous solution approach, and fifteen types of metal sulfide precursor solutions (metal = Cu, Zn, Sn, Ge, In, Sb, Mg, Cd, Mn, Bi, Fe, Ni, Li, Na, K) can be prepared using metal oxides or metal hydroxides as raw materials at room temperature under an air atmosphere. Moreover, elemental sulfur and selenium can also be highly dissolved. By this green route, high quality CZTS nanocrystal thin films can be deposited by directly coating the mixed Cu, Zn, and Sn precursor solutions without the need for complex nanocrystal synthesis. The remarkable power conversion efficiency of 6.62% was achieved, which is the highest value for aqueous solution deposited CZTSSe thin film solar cells.

Increasing energy demands and environmental problems have sparked intensive research on clean and sustainable alternative energy sources. Solar cells can directly convert solar energy to electricity, which is one of the most important applications of renewable energy. Metal sulfide/selenide thin films have attracted increasing attention as ideal absorber candidates for low-cost thin film solar cells. Highly efficient Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe), Pb(S,Se), Sb2(S,Se)3, SnS, Cu2S, Cu2(Sn,Ge)(S,Se)3 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin film solar cells have been extensively investigated in the laboratory. Recently, other copper-based Cu2(MII)(MIV)(S,Se)4 (MII = Mg, Cd, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; MIV = Ge, Sn) and Cu(MIII)(S,Se)2 (MIII = Sb, Bi) semiconductors have also received great attention as potential absorber materials for thin film solar cells. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a general, green, and low-cost solution approach for the deposition of various metal chalcogenide thin films.

A number of molecular precursor solution approaches have been utilized to fabricate metal chalcogenide thin films including the hydrazine-based solution process, the metal-salt/thiourea-based sol–gel process, the dithiocarbamate-based solution process, and the thiol/amine-based solution process. Although high quality metal chalcogenide thin films can be fabricated through these solution approaches, some harmful solvents such as hydrazine and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are required, which are not desirable in green chemistry. As is known, water is the greenest, cheapest, and most ideal solvent; thus the aqueous solution deposition approach is quite suitable for low-cost mass production of metal chalcogenide thin film solar cells. Owing to the poor wetting ability of the aqueous solution on molybdenum-coated substrates, there are only a few reports on aqueous solution deposited CZTSSe thin film solar cells in the literature. In this paper, we demonstrated a green and facile water-based precursor solution approach which possesses a remarkable ability to dissolve 15 metal oxides and metal hydroxides (CuO, ZnO, SnO, GeO2, In2O3, Sb2O3, MgO, CdO, MnO, Bi2O3, Fe2O3, NiO, LiOH, NaOH, KOH). These dissolution procedures are conducted in air at room temperature. Moreover, high quality CZTS nanocrystal thin films have been fabricated by this aqueous solution approach without the involvement of complex nanocrystal synthesis. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.62% has been realized for CZTSSe thin film solar cells, and it is the highest value for aqueous solution deposited CZTSSe solar cells so far.

Tin(II) oxide (SnO, 99.9%), germanium(IV) oxide (GeO2, 99.99%), indium(III) oxide (In2O3, 99.99%), antimony(III) oxide (Sb2O3, 99.99%), magnesium(II) oxide (MgO, 99.99%), cadmium(II) oxide (CdO, AR), manganese(II) oxide (MnO, 99.99%), bismuth(III) oxide (Bi2O3, 99.99%), iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, 99.99%), sodium(I) hydroxide (NaOH, AR), lithium(I) hydroxide (LiOH, 98%), potassium(I) hydroxide (KOH, AR), ammonium thioglycolate aqueous solution (HSCH2COO− NH4+, ∼70 wt% in H2O), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4, 99%), thiourea (NH2CSNH2, 99%), sulfur powder (99.9%) and selenium powder (99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin Inc. Zinc(II) oxide (ZnO, 99.99%) and nickel(II) oxide (NiO, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and copper(II) oxide (CuO, 99.99%) was obtained from ZhongNuo Advanced Material Technology Company. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.


4.0 mL of deionized water and 4.0 mL of ammonium thioglycolate aqueous solution were mixed in a 25 mL conical flask with magnetic stirring at room temperature, and 17 identical solutions were prepared. Next, CuO (0.159 g, 2 mmol), ZnO (0.163 g, 2 mmol), SnO (0.269 g, 2 mmol), GeO2(0.209 g, 2 mmol), In2O3 (0.278 g, 1 mmol), Sb2O3 (0.292 g, 1 mmol), MgO (0.081 g, 2 mmol), CdO (0.257 g, 2 mmol), MnO (0.142 g, 2 mmol), Bi2O3 (0.466 g, 1 mmol), Fe2O3 (0.160 g, 1 mmol), NiO (0.149 g, 2 mmol), NaOH (0.080 g, 2 mmol), LiOH (0.048 g, 2 mmol), KOH (0.112 g, 2 mmol), Se (0.316 g, 4 mmol), or S (0.128 g, 4 mmol) was loaded into the above-prepared solution, respectively. After a few minutes, a series of clear precursor solutions were obtained. Note that 1.0 mL of ammonia solution was used to improve the dissolution ability of some raw materials (CdO, MnO, Bi2O3, Fe2O3, NiO, S, and Se).


CuO (0.280 g, 3.52 mmol), ZnO (0.195 g, 2.4 mmol), SnO (0.269 g, 2 mmol), 2.5 mL of deionized water, and 3.5 mL of ammonium thioglycolate aqueous solution were loaded into a glass vial. A homogeneous light yellow solution was formed after about 15 min of magnetic stirring at room temperature. Afterwards, the CZTS precursor solution was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min.


Molybdenum-coated soda lime glass (SLG) (20 × 20 × 1.1 mm) was used as the substrate and the CZTS thin films were deposited by spin-coating the CZTS precursor solution at 3200 rpm for 20 s in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The as-deposited thin films were annealed on a hot plate at 320 °C for 2 min to eliminate water, organic residues, and form the CZTS nanocrystal thin film. The spin-coating and annealing steps were repeated several times until the CZTS nanocrystal thin film has a targeted thickness (∼1.5 μm). Finally, a selenization process for the CZTS nanocrystal thin film was conducted at 540 °C for 10 min in a graphite box containing 0.3 g of selenium powder, which was placed into a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace (MTI, OTF-1200X-4-RTP) under nitrogen flow (ramp to 540 °C at 8.5 °C s−1).


The CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices were prepared with a conventional structure of SLG/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al. First, an approximately 60 nm thick CdS buffer layer was deposited onto the CZTSSe film by a modified chemical bath deposition method. Then, 50 nm of i-ZnO and 250 nm of indium tin oxide (ITO) were successively deposited by RF magnetron sputtering and DC magnetron sputtering, respectively. At last, the Al grid electrodes as the front contact were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask on the top of devices. Each solar cell device has an active area of 0.19 cm2 (∼94% of the total device area) which was defined by mechanical scribing, forming nine standard SLG/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/Al devices on every substrate.


The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi S-4800 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (Bruker AXS XFlash detector4010). The sample for EDX measurements was prepared on a glass substrate. The XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA/DSC 1 STARe of Mettler-Toledo. J−V curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (Abet Sun 2000; AM 1.5) using a homemade probe station. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport optical power meter (model 842-PE). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve was obtained using a Zolix SCS100 QE system equipped with a 150 W xenon light source and a lock-in amplifier. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB-MKII 250 XPS (VG Co., U.K.) with an Al Kα X-ray source. The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum was recorded using a Metash UV-5200 spectrophotometer. The C–V curve was measured using an Agilent E-4980A LCR meter.


Recently, we developed an environmentally friendly organic solution approach for the deposition of binary, ternary and quaternary semiconductor nanocrystal thin films by dissolving metal oxides, metal hydroxides, and metal salts in a mixture of thioglycolic acid, ethanolamine, and 2-methoxyethanol. Here, we presented a greener water-based solution approach to obtain 15 metal precursor solutions by dissolving the corresponding metal oxides or metal hydroxides, as shown in the top of Fig. 1. The dissolution of metal oxides in ammonium thioglycolate is mainly due to a strong coordination ability of organic thiols with metal ions. Recently, it was reported that elemental selenium can be dissolved in a mixture of oleylamine and 1-dodecanethiol. We found that non-metallic sulfur and selenium are also highly dissolved in the aqueous solution of ammonium thioglycolate, which provides a general approach to deposit many types of metal sulfide and metal selenide nanocrystal thin films via a simple spin-coating process. In this paper, a CZTS nanocrystal thin film was prepared by spin-coating a CZTS precursor aqueous solution, followed by a sintering process. First, a CZTS precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CuO, ZnO, and SnO in a commercial ammonium thioglycolate aqueous solution, as illustrated in the bottom of Fig. 1. After stirring at room temperature for about 15 min, we observed that all solids are completely dissolved, forming a light-yellow CZTS precursor solution. It should be noted that ammonium thioglycolate is widely used in the cosmetics and pharmacy industry due to its low toxicity. Thus, our method is environmentally friendly.

Fig. S1 displays thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the CZTS precursors. To obtain the TGA/DSC sample, the CZTS precursor solution was dried at 80 °C for 48 h. The first stage of weight loss from 90 °C to 120 °C was mainly attributed to the evaporation of residual water. The second major weight loss between 150 and 245 °C corresponds to the thermal decomposition of CZTS precursors, which leads to the formation of CZTS nanocrystals. Therefore, the CZTS nanocrystal thin film was obtained by spin-coating CZTS precursor solution, followed by a sintering process on a pre-heated hot plate at 320 °C for 2 min. The as-deposited CZTS nanocrystal thin film exhibited a very smooth and crack-free surface (see Fig. 2e). A high quality CZTS nanocrystal thin film with a uniform film thickness of ∼1.5 μm was obtained by repeating the spin-coating process seven times, as presented in Fig. 2g and S2. Next, the as-deposited CZTS nanocrystal thin film was selenized at 540 °C for 10 min to induce crystal growth, forming a large-grained CZTSSe absorber layer. Fig. 2f displays a top-view SEM image of the selenized CZTSSe thin film, which revealed an extremely compact and dense surface with the grain sizes of 0.5–2.0 μm. Finally, a CdS buffer layer, intrinsic ZnO, ITO, and the aluminum grid electrode were subsequently deposited onto the CZTSSe surface to fabricate a SLG/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/Al solar cell device. A cross-sectional SEM image of a completed CZTSSe solar cell is shown in Fig. 2c and 2d. It was observed that the selenized CZTSSe absorber layer has a bi-layer structure containing a densely large-grained top layer (∼0.7 μm) and a fine-grained bottom layer (∼0.9 μm).
The chemical composition of the selenized CZTSSe thin films is of great significance to the performance of the CZTSSe solar cells. It is commonly accepted that a Cu-poor and Zn-rich composition is required for high-efficiency devices. To investigate the effects of metal ratios on the quality of CZTSSe thin films, different Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratios (0.75:1; 0.8:1; 0.85:1; 1.2:1) were utilized in the precursor solutions while the Zn/Sn ratio was fixed at 1.2:1. The top-view SEM images of the selenized CZTSSe thin films with different Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratios are shown in Fig. S3. As shown in Fig. S3a, some obvious pinholes were observed on the surface of the selenized CZTSSe thin films when the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio was 0.75:1. When the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio was increased to 0.85:1 or 1.2:1, it was found that some hexagonal Cu(S,Se)x impurity appeared on the surface of CZTSSe thin films (see Fig. S3c and S3d). As previous papers reported, the phase separation and pinholes in selenized CZTSSe thin films would seriously damage the performance of the CZTSSe solar cells, so we employed the optimal Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio of 0.8:1 in our work (see Fig. S3b) to fabricate CZTSSe thin film solar cells. The corresponding EDX spectrum and chemical composition of the as-prepared CZTS thin film are shown in Fig. S4. In addition, the Cu-poor and Zn-rich compositions can avoid the formation of undesirable CuZn antisite defects. In our selenized CZTSSe thin films, it was found that the composition of CZTSSe was Cu1.78Zn1.15Sn1.0S0.32Se3.68 with a Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio of 0.83 and a Zn/Sn molar ratio of 1.15, which was determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (see Fig. S5), confirming that the highly desired Cu-poor and Zn-rich CZTSSe absorber layer was formed.
To analyze the valence states of Cu, Zn, and Sn ions in the selenized CZTSSe thin film, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. Fig. S6 shows the XPS spectra of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, and Se for the selenized CZTSSe thin film. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the Cu2p peaks were located at 931.1 eV and 950.9 eV with a splitting value of 19.8 eV (see Fig. S6b) corresponding to Cu+ rather than Cu2+. Zn2+ was confirmed by a splitting value of 22.9 eV, and Zn2p peaks appeared at 1020.7 eV and 1043.7 eV (see Fig. S6c). The Sn 3d peaks were located at 485.7 eV and 494.2 eV (see Fig. S6d) indicating that Sn ions have a valence state of +4. In addition, the XPS spectra of the as-prepared CZTS thin film were also recorded and are shown in Fig. S7.
The crystal structures of as-deposited CZTS and selenized CZTSSe thin films were examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 3. The as-deposited CZTS thin film shows very weak and broad diffraction peaks due to a small crystal size (Fig. 3, black line). The three broad XRD peaks at 27.05°, 28.51°, and 30.58° can be indexed to the (100), (002), and (101) planes of wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals. The crystal size of CZTS nanocrystals calculated using the Scherrer equation is around 10.0 nm. When the as-prepared CZTS thin film was exposed to selenium vapor at 540 °C for 10 min, the XRD peaks become strong and sharp, indicating that high crystallinity and large grained CZTSSe thin films are obtained. Meanwhile, the metastable wurtzite structure of the CZTS thin film converted into a thermally stable kesterite structure of the CZTSSe thin film after the selenization at 540 °C. The major diffraction peaks at 27.35°, 45.35°, and 53.77° can be assigned to the (112), (204)/(220), and (312)/(116) planes of kesterite CZTSSe, which are in good agreement with those of previously reported kesterite CZTSSe thin films.
The dark and light J–V curves of the best CZTSSe solar cell are shown in Fig. 4a. The best solar cell device had a PCE of 6.62% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.421 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 30.68 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 51.24%. The stability of the CZTSSe solar cell was evaluated and is shown in Fig. S9. A decrease in PCE of only 0.1% was observed for the CZTSSe solar cell after 60 days of air storage at room temperature without any encapsulation. In addition, nine CZTSSe solar cell devices were built on the same substrate, and their PCEs are in the range of 6.13–6.62%, yielding an average PCE of 6.34% (the detailed solar cell parameters are listed in Table S1).
To further confirm Jsc from the light J–V curve, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was recorded and is shown in Fig. 4b. The maximum value of EQE in the visible light range is around 90% (at 690 nm). The EQE decrease in the range of 690–1100 nm is probably due to the strong recombination at the backside and a narrow depletion region. The EQE loss below 530 nm is mainly due to the absorption of the CdS buffer layer. The calculated Jsc from the EQE curve was 30.71 mA cm−2, which was very close to the value obtained from the light J–V curve. In addition, the band gap of the CZTSSe absorber layer was 1.14 eV, determined from a plot of [E × ln(1 − EQE)]2vs. E. This value is significantly lower than that of the as-prepared CZTS thin film (∼1.52 V) extracted from the absorption spectrum (see Fig. S8), indicating that sulfur ions were mostly replaced by selenium ions during the selenization process.

Fig. 5 presents C–V and 1/C2–V curves of the CZTSSe solar cell for calculating the effective carrier concentration of the CZTSSe absorber layer. Using the Mott–Schottky method, the net carrier concentration was calculated to be 1.3 × 1016 cm−3, close to those of previously reported high efficiency CZTSSe thin film solar cells. The hole concentration could be further improved by doping alkali metals, such as Li+, Na+, and K+ ions. In our system, LiOH, NaOH, and KOH can be dissolved in ammonium thioglycolate aqueous solution, as shown in Fig. 1. For an aqueous solution process, a wide variety of water-soluble alkali salts can also be directly introduced into the CZTS precursor solution.

In summary, we have demonstrated a green, facile, and low-cost aqueous solution process for preparing many types of metal sulfide precursor solutions. Inexpensive metal oxides and metal hydroxides were used as the starting materials and water was used as the solvent. Through this green and facile approach, a high quality CZTS nanocrystal thin film was directly deposited by coating the mixed Cu, Zn, and Sn precursor solutions. The as-fabricated CZTSSe solar cells exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 6.62%. The preliminary PCE results could be further improved by the incorporation of alkali metals and the deposition of the anti-reflection layer. In addition, this aqueous solution deposition approach could also be extended to other metal chalcogenide thin film solar cells, such as Cu(In,Ga)Se2, Sb2(S,Se)3, SnS, Cu2S, FeS2, Cu2(Sn,Ge)(S,Se)3, Cu(MIII)(S,Se)2 (MIII = Sb, Bi), and Cu2(MII)(MIV)(S,Se)4 (MII = Mg, Cd, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; MIV = Ge, Sn).
