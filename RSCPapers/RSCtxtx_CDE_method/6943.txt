Four isostructural donor–acceptor alternating polymers of benzodithiophene (BDT)/naphthodifuran (NDF) and benzoselenadiazole (BSe)/benzothiadiazole (BT) have been developed and evaluated for organic photovoltaics. The substitution of one-atom (Se for S) in the accepting units exerts remarkable impact on the optoelectronic properties of polymers. Extended absorption, narrowed bandgap and higher HOMO energy levels were observed for Se-containing polymers in comparison to their S-containing counterparts. Theoretical calculations confirmed the measurable effect on energy levels as found in experimental studies. Bulk-heterojuction solar cells based on the BDT–BSe copolymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (1:2, w/w) blend films deliver the best PCE of 5.40%. BSe-based polymers showed enhanced photovoltaic performances than BT-based polymers. The device performance is found to be strongly dependent on the processing conditions and morphology of the active layers.

The bulk-heterojuction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), by sandwiching a blend of an electron-donating conjugated polymer and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative as an active layer between electrodes, have been extensively studied as clean energy resources in recent decades. Narrow-bandgap polymers by alternating electron-rich units (donor, D) and electron-deficient units (acceptor, A) along the main chain, have been strategically designed for high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Great progress has been made under the combined effort of materials innovation, interface engineering and morphology control. The landmark PCEs for PSCs have been pushed upto 10% for single-layer bulk heterojunction and 11.3% for tandem devices. However, there are still some key issues to be solved for their commercial application, such as higher PCEs and dependable encapsulation technology to secure long-life working photovoltaic devices.

D–A polymers have demonstrated their advantages in extending absorption spectra, improving charge carrier mobility, and fine-tuning energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of polymers. The ideal polymer donors are suggested to possess wide absorption and a relatively low-lying HOMO level to offset with fullerene acceptors for efficient charge separation while maximizing the open circuit voltage (Voc) and high hole mobility. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of BHJ solar cells is mainly determined by the amount of light absorbed in the active layer. The fill factor (FF) of PSCs, strongly dependent on the morphology of the active layer, is thus determined by the solubility of polymers and their compatibility with fullerenes (e.g., PC61BM, PC71BM) in solution processing.
Among the widely explored A units, a S-containing benzothiadiazole (BT) unit has attracted much attention due to its strong electron-accepting properties in controlling the energy levels of narrow bandgap polymers for high-efficiency PSCs. Substitution of a S atom with heavier chalcogenidses (e.g., Se, Te) in π-conjugated materials has opened a promising avenue to expand the repertoire of these conjugated subunits, due to their unique structural and electronic properties. The substitution of a S atom with Se in accepting units in polymer backbones generally decreases the bandgaps, with some of the Se-containing polymers demonstrating higher photovoltaic performance. Strong intramolecular Se–N interactions were revealed to facilitate efficient π–π stacking in the solid state by forming head-to-head dimers in benzoselenodiazole (BSe) based D–A–D small molecules. In order to investigate the impact of heteroatom substitution in A-units on D–A polymers, four isostructural polymers were thus designed by alternating BSe or BT based accepting-units with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) or naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (NDF) based D-units.
Featuring a large and planar molecular structure to promote backbone π–π stacking for better charge transport, BDT and NDF have been successfully explored as D-building blocks for D–A polymers. The weak donor properties of BDT and NDF units endows the polymers with a low HOMO, which leads to high Voc for the resulting PSCs. Four isostructural D–A copolymers, namely, PBDTT-DTBT, PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe were thus developed. The effect of one-atom substitution of S with Se in accepting units on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers and the photovoltaic performance of their devices was systematically studied. The best BHJ device by blending PBDTT-DTBSe with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, 1:2, w/w) exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.40%, with a Jsc of 11.23 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V and a FF of 64.1%.

BDT and NDF based monomers, 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (M1) and (1,6-dinonylnaphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran-2,7-diyl)-bis(trimethylstannane) (M2), as well as a BT monomer, 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (M3), were prepared as our previous reports. The synthesis of 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazole (M4) is shown in Scheme 1. Starting from catechol, the key intermediate compound, 4,5-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazole 4 was readily prepared by a four-step protocol including alkoxylation, nitration, reduction and ring closure. By flanking two thiophene moieties on both sides of the as-obtained alkoxy-substituted BSe core, DTBSe was developed as a contrastive accepting unit. The detailed synthesis procedure is provided in the ESI.

The standard Stille coupling reactions were performed between the BDT (or NDF) monomer M1 (or M2) and the DTBSe (or DTBT) monomer M4 (or M3). After precipitation from methanol, the polymers were successively washed with methanol, acetone, hexane and chloroform (CF) by Soxhlet extraction. The CF extract was further precipitated from methanol to afford D–A polymers in 87–95% yields. All polymers exhibited good solubility in organic solvents such as o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chlorobenzene (CB), CF and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTT-DTBT, PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) as 33.05, 41.36, 26.13 and 31.15 kg mol−1, respectively. And the corresponding polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) was 3.17, 4.86, 4.33 and 4.27.
Thermal stability of the polymers was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1, ESI). All polymers show good thermal stability, with the decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight-loss temperature) observed at 316, 306, 316, and 305 °C for PBDTT-DTBT, PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe, respectively. The Td of the Se-based polymer PBDTT-DTBSe (or PNDF-DTBSe) is slightly lower than that of the S-based polymer PBDTT-DTBT (or PNDF-DTBT). However, the thermal stabilities of the four copolymers were good enough for their applications in optoelectronic devices.

The impact of one-atom variation (Se for S) on the optical properties of DTBT and DTBSe units was revealed by the UV-vis absorption spectra of M3 and M4 in dilute CF solutions (∼10−5 M). As clearly shown in Fig. 1a, M4 exhibits an absorption band in the range of 385–570 nm with a λmax peaking at 473 nm, while DTBT based M3 has an absorption band ranging from 370 to 540 nm peaking at 446 nm. The ∼30 nm red-shifted absorption profile of M4 indicates the stronger electron-accepting nature of the DTBSe unit than the DTBT analogue.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of both DTBSe and DTBT based polymers were compared in both dilute CHCl3 solutions (Fig. 1a) and thin films (Fig. 1b), with the characteristic data summarized in Table 1. BDTT polymers, PBDTT-DTBSe and PBDTT-DTBT exhibit wide and strong absorption profiles, featuring three major absorption peaks in the range of 300–750 nm. However, NDF polymers, PNDF-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe present two-major-peak absorption profiles. The peaks at the shorter wavelength region (∼300–500 nm) were due to the π–π* transition of the conjugated polymer backbone, while the second absorption band in the longer wavelength region (∼500–850 nm) was attributed to the strong intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) interaction between the electron-rich unit and the electron-deficient unit building blocks of the polymers. It should be noted that DTBSe based polymers presented quite similar absorption bands to their DTBT counterparts. It is considered that the replacement of S with Se didn't change the electron-withdrawing capacity of the A unit. Compared with our early reported D–A alternating polymers of triazoloquinoxaline (TzQx) or dithienylbenzo[c][1,2,5]-oxadiazole (DTBO) with BDT or NDF, DTBSe and DTBT polymers exhibited 50–100 blue-shifted absorption bands. It is thus evident that DTSe has slightly stronger electron-accepting ability than DTBO, but much weaker than TzQx. The only difference observed is that DTBSe based polymers exhibited enhanced absorption at shorter wavelength peaks in comparison to their DTBT analogues. This behavior on the atom-alteration from S to Se has been seldom reported in the literature. The reason may be attributed to easier delocalization of electron clouds along polymer backbones, leading to stronger π–π* transition along the polymer mainchain.

The polymer thin films exhibit absorption profiles similar to their solutions. However, the absorption maxima of polymer films were all red-shifted in comparison to their solutions. For instance, Se-containing PBDTT-DTBSe and PNDF-DTBSe films exhibit a ∼30 nm red-shifted absorption band when compared with the corresponding solutions. This phenomenon is often observed for conjugated polymers, mainly attributed to the formation of more ordered structures in solid-state films. For polymer films, the replacement of a S atom with Se in accepting units also resulted in a ∼25 nm red-shift in the absorption spectra when comparing two pairs of BDTT and NDF-based polymers. Such a red shift in absorption maxima with single-atom substitution (from S to Se) is mainly attributed to the lower ionization potential of the larger atom (Se), which, in turn, leads to a shallow HOMO level and a narrower bandgap.
By using the UV-vis absorption onset (λonset) of polymer films, the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of polymers can be calculated as Eoptg = 1240/λonset eV. It is evident that narrower Eoptg (1.62 and 1.60 eV for PBDTT-DTSe and PNDF-DTSe, respectively) was obtained for Se-containing polymers when compared with their S-containing congeners (1.70 and 1.65 eV for PBDTT-DTBT and PNDF-DTBT, respectively). The reduction of bandgap via single-atom substitution (from S to Se or N) in polymer backbones has also been observed in small molecules and other conjugated polymers.

By using the onset potentials (Eonsetox) of the oxidation curves from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, the HOMO level of a polymer can be calculated. The Eonsetox of PBDTT-DTBT is estimated to be 1.01 V, while 0.84, 0.96 and 0.88 V for PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding HOMO energy level of four polymers was calculated to be −5.41, −5.24, −5.36 and −5.28 eV, respectively (Table 1). The deep HOMO levels (≤−5.0 eV) of these polymers could be beneficial to obtain higher Voc for PSCs based on these polymer donors, since device Voc is proportional to the difference between the LUMO of the electron acceptor and the HOMO of the electron donor.

With the as-calculated HOMO level and optical Eoptg, the LUMO level of these polymers was thus calculated to be −3.71, −3.62, −3.71, −3.68 eV, respectively. The HOMO–LUMO energy diagrams of the polymers and PC71BM are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). It is obvious that Se-containing polymers exhibited higher HOMO energy levels than their corresponding S-containing congeners, which may result in lower Voc of PSCs for the Se-containing counterparts than their S-containing counterparts.

To better understand the impact of single-atom substitution in the A unit on the HOMO/LUMO levels and planarity of the resulting polymers, theoretical calculation was performed and initially optimized at the HF/3-21G level. To simplify the calculations, only two repetition units of the polymer backbones were employed for the simulation; long alkyl or alkyloxy side chains were substituted by methyl or methoxy, respectively. The optimal geometries and electronic structures of polymers (Fig. 2) were simulated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level using the Gaussian 09 program suite.

As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMOs of all model compounds for polymers are extensively delocalized, with the electron density of the LUMO being mainly localized on the electron-accepting BT or BSe units. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the repetition units for PBDTT–DTBT, PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe were calculated to be −4.77/−2.70, −4.62/−2.60, −4.73/−2.67 and −4.67/−2.65 eV, respectively. The corresponding bandgaps were calculated as 2.07, 2.02, 2.06 and 2.02 eV, respectively. By a close look at the data for model compounds corresponding to two polymer pairs, i.e., PBDTT-DTSe/PBDTT-DTBTT and PNDF-DTSe/PNDF/DTBT, one can find that the substitution of S with Se in the A unit results in higher HOMO energy levels and thus narrower bandgaps for the polymers. Due to shorter conjugated backbones taken into account, although the energy levels of repetition units are all higher than the experimental values, the variation of HOMO levels and bandgaps with S replaced by a Se-atom in A units is in good agreement with the experimental data obtained from UV-vis absorption and CV measurements for the polymers.

The photovoltaic performance of the as-prepared four polymers was evaluated by blending with fullerenes (both PC61BM and PC71BM) as the active layer. Thin-film BHJ solar cells with configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS(45 nm)/polymer:fullerene(100 nm)/LiF(1.0 nm)/Al(100 nm) were fabricated. The composition of blend films and the processing solvents for spin-coating have been investigated. The processing additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (0–5% by volume) was added into the mixture solution of polymer:fullerene in o-DCB, CF, or CB prior to spin-coating. The thickness of blend films was controlled by the spin-speed of the spin-coater. All devices were prepared under a N2 atmosphere and characterized in air without encapsulation, where J–V measurements were performed under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The photovoltaic parameters of all tested devices are summarized in Table 2.

Different solvents (o-DCB, CB or CF) and weight ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) of polymer:PC61BM were explored for making blend films. The active layers prepared from CF solution with a weight ratio of 1:2 showed the best film-forming properties. To optimize the photovoltaic performance of the devices, different volume ratios of DIO in CF were explored for the preparation of active layers. The PBDTT-DTBSe solar cells made from CF solutions with 1–4% DIO showed increased Jsc. PBDTT-DTBSe/PC61BM (1:2) cells processed with 3% DIO delivered the highest PCE of 3.85%, with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 8.95 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58.2%. Thermal annealing the active layers (ca. 80 °C for 5 min), however, did not improve the device performance. The PBDTT-DTBT/PC61BM (1:2) device processed with 3% DIO in CF solution also showed the best device performance (3.66% PCE).
The optimized processing conditions were adopted for the fabrication of PNDF-DTBSe and PNDF-DTBT devices. By spin-coating polymer:PC61BM (1:2) blend films from their CF solutions with 3% DIO, PNDF-DTBSe/PC61BM (1:2) devices showed significantly increased Jsc and PCE for the devices. A highest PCE of 3.31% was obtained, with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 7.28 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.2%. And PNDF-DTBT/PC61BM (1:2) devices gave a PCE of 2.78%, with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 6.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55.2%.
In order to achieve a better PCE and photovoltaic properties of the devices, PC71BM was used to replace PC61BM, since PC71BM has a stronger absorption than PC61BM. By adopting the optimized processing conditions as for PC61BM devices, the polymer/PC71BM (1:2) blend film based devices were fabricated. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a and photovoltaic parameters are also summarized in Table 2. Compared with PSCs using PC61BM as the acceptor, the corresponding PC71BM devices presented dramatically improved PCEs. This improvement is largely attributed to the increased FF and Jsc values. In particular, PC71BM based devices all exhibited FFs over 63.8%, while PC61BM based devices only showed FFs ranging from 48.3% to 63.4%. When replacing PC61BM with PC71BM, PBDTT-DTBSe, PBDTT-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe based solar cells exhibited a distinct increase in Jsc, while PNDF-DTBT devices only showed a small increase of Jsc. The optimized polymer:PC71BM solar cells afforded the best PCE of 5.40% for PBDTT-DTBSe, 4.57% for PBDTT-DTBT, 3.75% for PNDF-DTBSe, and 3.57% for PNDF-DTBT. Compared to the S-containing congeners, the Se-containing polymer based devices possessed slightly lower Voc values, which is in accordance with the variation tendency of the HOMO energy levels of the polymers.
Our polymers contributed better photovoltaic performance than the similarly structured polymers in the literature. For example, PBDTT-DTBSe:PC71BM (1:2) devices contributed higher PCE (5.40%) than PBDT-DTBSe:PC71BM (1:2) devices, which delivered a PCE of 3.13%, with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 9.37 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.48. The greatly improved PCE for PBDTT-DTBSe is attributed to the enhanced Voc and FF values with a thiophene moiety introduced onto the 4,8-positions of the BDT core for PBDTT-DTBSe. PBDTT-DTBT:PC71BM (1:2) devices also exhibited higher PCE (4.57%) than PBDTPO-DTBT:PC71BM (1:2) ones, where a PCE of 3.4% was reported, with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 9.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.47. The higher PCE can be greatly attributed to the higher FF value.
It is noted that Voc scales with the difference between the HOMO of the polymer donor and the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor.Voc is thus determined by recombination at the donor/acceptor interface in PSCs. From the equivalent circuit model, the equation for Voc characteristic of a solar cell can be derived as Voc ≈ nkT/eln(Jsc/J0), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, e is the elementary charge, n is the ideality factor and J0 is the reverse saturation current density. For a solar cell device, the less recombination losses and a high Jsc are thus beneficial for the Voc improvement. A similar phenomenon was revealed in our work. These parameters are generally related to charge separation in polymer:fullerene blends.
By a close look at the photovoltaic data of all our polymers, one can find that the Jsc values of all devices, especially for NDF based polymers, were relatively low (<12 mA cm−2). This parameter is generally related to charge separation in a polymer:fullerene blend, which may be dramatically improved by optimizing its morphology by device engineering approaches such as inserting alcohol/water-soluble conjugated polymers like a poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) layer, thermal annealing, additive processing, solvent vapor annealing, and interface engineering. Importantly, the Voc data of four polymer based solar cells are in good agreement with their HOMO levels. And the increased HOMO levels of Se-containing polymers exhibited slightly lower Voc than their S-containing counterparts.
The accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements was confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device (Fig. 3b), where the PSC devices were fabricated under the same conditions as those for J–V measurements. All devices showed a broad photo-response over the range of 300–750 nm. The current calculated from the EQE spectra (data in Table 2) are consistent with the Jsc values measured from J–V curves. In general, Se-functionalized D–A polymers exhibited higher EQE than the corresponding S-containing counterparts. With a maximum of 70% peaking at 400 nm, the PBDTT-DTBSe devices exhibit higher EQE over 50% in the range of 365–600 nm, suggesting a highly efficient photo-conversion process and balanced charge transport in the devices. The PBDTT-DTBSe based solar cells, therefore, achieved the highest Jsc of 11.23 mA cm−2 of the device. The hole mobility of the polymer blend with PC71BM was measured in the hole-only device with the same configuration as PSCs using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobilities of PBDTT-DTBT/PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT/PNDF-DTBSe were determined to be 2.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1/5.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/5.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The NDF-based polymer hole mobilities with a decrease of almost an order of magnitude could be the reason for the low Jsc and poor performance compared with BDT-based polymers.

As a crucial factor for the performance of PSCs, the morphological features of the film were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The morphology of polymer:PC71BM blend films was further compared to reveal the impact of morphology on device performance. As shown in Fig. 4, PBDTT-DTBT/PC71BM and PBDTT-DTBSe/PC71BM blend films exhibited quite similar morphology, where very fine domains without large phases are observed. The PBDTT-DTBSe/PC71BM blend films presented a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.72 nm for the surface (Fig. 4b), while a smaller RMS of 2.76 nm was observed for the PBDTT-DTBT/PC71BM film (Fig. 4a). The nanoscale phase separation and the bi-continuous interpenetrating network (IPN) morphology between the polymer donor (PBDTT-DTBT or PBDTT-DTBSe) and the electron-acceptor (PC71BM) offered a large interface to facilitate the efficient collection and transportation of the photogenerated charges and thus desirable Jsc.

In contrast, PNDF-DTBT:PC71BM and PNDF-DTBSe:PC71BM blend films (Fig. 4c and d) presented rougher topology, with a RMS of 4.76 and 8.23 nm observed, respectively. Meanwhile, large areas with the peak-to-valley height of ∼30 nm may affect the exciton separation and transportation of the charge carrier via IPN, thus leading to a lower Jsc.

In summary, four isostructural narrow bandgap polymers have been successfully developed by alternating benzodithiophene or naphthodifuran with benzothiadiazole or benzoselenadiazole. The one-atom variation, Se for S, in two polymer pairs (PBDTT-DTBT/PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT/PNDF-DTBSe) did result in changes with respect to optoelectronics (i.e., absorption band, bandgap and HOMO/LUMO energy levels). The Se-containing polymers demonstrate extended absorption spectra, narrower bandgaps and higher HOMO energy levels in comparison to the S-containing congeners. The Se-containing polymers demonstrated better photovoltaic performance than the S-containing counterparts, partly due to improved optoelectronic properties and morphology of the BHJ film when paired with PC71BM. The PBDTT-DTBSe/PC71BM (1:2, w/w) solar cells delivered the best PCE of 5.40%, with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 11.23 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.1%. Device engineering and interface engineering, including the screening of solvents, processing of additives and the selection of acceptors are of importance to achieve high-performance PSCs.


All reagent-grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., and they were used directly without further purification. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS) was procured from H. C. Starck. Toluene and THF were dried over sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled before use. Column chromatography was carried out with 300–400 nm mesh silica.


4,5-Bis(dodecyloxy)benzene-1,2-diaminium chloride (5.0 g, 9.1 mmol), triethylamine (91 mmol, 12.6 mL) and freshly-dried dichloromethane (100 mL) were subsequently added into a nitrogen-filled flask. To the mixture solution selenium dioxide (8.07 g, 72.8 mmol) solution in dichloromethane (50 mL) was slowly added at room temperature. After refluxing for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere, the reaction was terminated with deionized water (100 mL). The reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, and the collected organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4.

Stille-coupling of BDT (or NDF) with DTBSe (or DTBT) monomers for the synthesis of D–A copolymers including PBDTT-DTBT, PBDTT-DTBSe, PNDF-DTBT and PNDF-DTBSe is shown in Scheme 1. Typically, monomers M1 (or M2, 0.4 mmol) and M3 (or M4, 0.4 mmol) were dissolved in dry toluene (10 mL) in a Schlenk tube. Under the protection of N2, the catalyst Pd2(dba)3 (11.0 mg, 0.012 mmol, 3% equiv.) and ligand P(o-tolyl)3 (14.6 mg, 0.048 mmol, 12% equiv.) were quickly added. After flushing with N2 for 15 min, the reaction mixture was refluxed for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL). The collected precipitate was Soxhlet-extracted in sequence with methanol, acetone and hexane each for 24 h. The polymer was recovered from the chloroform fraction and precipitated in methanol. After drying in vacuo, the title polymers were obtained and characterized as follows. PBDTT-DTBT: a dark violet solid (90% yield).

The BHJ solar cells with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:fullerene/LiF/Al were fabricated. The ITO glass substrates were sonicated sequentially in deionized water, acetone, deionized water and isopropanol. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the substrates were cleaned by oxygen plasma for 10 min. A thin layer (45 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO and air-dried at 150 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. Solutions of polymer and PCBM at different weight ratios in o-DCB, CF, or CB containing 0–5% (v/v) DIO, filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter, were spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS at 1000 rpm for 60 s (total blend concentration, 30 mg mL−1). LiF (1.0 nm, 0.2 A s−1) and Al (100 nm) layers were then thermally evaporated on the active layer at the chamber pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150V) and verified using a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a certified IPCE instrument (Zolix Instruments, Inc, SolarCellScan100).
