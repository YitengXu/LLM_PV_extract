A novel crown ether lithium salt complex [Li∈12-C-4][I] has been designed, synthesized and characterized. The thermal properties of the [Li∈12-C-4][I] based solid-state electrolytes were also investigated in detail. The particular trapping ability of 12-crown-4 to Li+ can obviously reduce the cation–anion (Li+–I−) interaction and hence facilitate favorable electrical properties of the solid-state electrolytes. Therefore, [Li∈12-C-4][I] represents ionic conductivity of 3.93 × 10−5 and 1.53 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 and 80 °C, respectively. Further addition of the ionic liquid 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodine as a crystal growth inhibitor can effectively suppress the crystallization of the complex for more amorphous and smoother regions, which are much more conducive towards higher ion conductivity by the segmental motion of molecule chains. For application, the resulting device showed a power conversion efficiency of 5% and displayed excellent long-term stability. These results offer us more opportunities to explore simple and novel solid-state electrolytes for energy storage and conversion.

In most electrochemical devices, electrolytes are ubiquitous and indispensable materials. Due to their outstanding dissolvability of inorganic and organic compounds, large dielectric coefficients to dissociate inorganic salts, and feasible permeability across the electrodes, electrolytes have been supposed as highly promising mediums to facilitate the transfer of charge (e.g. H+, Li+ and I−) for renewable energy devices. However, organic liquid/gel electrolytes containing organic solvent often suffer from serious drawbacks caused by volatilization, leakage, flammability and electrode corrosion, restraining the long-term stability and practical security of their devices. In this regard, solid-state electrolytes have attracted great attention for extensive research interest. For example, Bruce's group developed a series of polymer electrolytes by dissolving LiXF6 (X = P, As, Sb) in polyethylene oxide (PEO). These new polymer electrolytes could remain at around 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature, displaying their potential use in rechargeable lithium batteries. Bouchet and coworkers designed a multifunctional single-ion polymer electrolyte based on polyanionic block copolymers comprising polystyrene segments. The ionic conductivity of ∼1.3 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 60 °C, high Li+ transport number (>0.85) and improved mechanical strength rendered the electrolyte to be a new class of macromolecular material for lithium metal batteries. In dye-sensitized solar cells, an overall photoelectric conversion efficiency of over 13% has been achieved by embedding cobalt redox shuttles into an organic liquid electrolyte. However, dye degradation, the leakage and evaporation of organic solvent, and electrode corrosion restrain the long-term performance for their practical application. Therefore, several methods, including the use of p-type semiconductors and hole conductors, especially polymer electrolytes, have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. Unfortunately, because of the lower conductivity and imperfect soakage of porous electrodes with polymer electrolytes, it is still a big challenge to improve the ion dynamics and permeability. Impressively, small molecular based solid-state ionic conductors provide a higher ion conductivity, better solution-processable properties and a more satisfactory contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes, highlighting their widespread application in fuel cells, lithium batteries and dye-sensitized solar cells. Therefore, new solid-state electrolytes still offer more opportunities to explore the basic research interest surrounding them, and have extensive, promising applications in energy storage and conversion fields.

Here, we design and synthesize a simple solid-state electrolyte based on a crown ether lithium salt complex ([Li∈12-C-4][I]) by mixing the liquid-state 12-crown-4 with lithium iodide. The chemical structure and thermal properties have been confirmed and characterized using a range of studies including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The thermal properties, ion conductivity, and surface morphology of the [Li∈12-C-4][I] based solid-state electrolytes were also investigated. As an application, the solid-state electrolytes were further used to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

12-Crown-4, lithium iodide (LiI) and iodine (I2) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and were used as received. PMII was purchased from Merck. H2PtCl6 and the organic dye Z-907 were purchased from Aldrich. All the chemical reagents were used without further treatment. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrodes (8 Ω sq−1), and slurries containing 20 nm-sized mesopores and 200 nm-diameter light-scattering TiO2 colloids were purchased from Dalian Hepat Chroma Solar Tech. Co., Ltd (China).


[Li∈12-C-4][I] was synthesized as follows: briefly, a mixture of 12-crown-4 (31 mmol, 5.46 g) and LiI (30 mmol, 4.02 g) in 20 mL of ethanol was stirred at 50 °C for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the evaporation of the solvent, the excess 12-crown-4 was further removed by vacuum distillation at 80 °C. The product was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h to produce [Li∈12-C-4][I] with a yield of 98%.


The components of the solid-state electrolytes employed in this work are listed in Table 1. All the electrolytes were dried under vacuum at room temperature for 48 h before the characterization and fabrication of the DSSCs. The thermal stability of sample A (12-crown-4) and electrolyte B ([Li∈12-C-4][I]) was tested by TGA. For DSC analysis, sample A and the electrolytes B–G containing different contents of PMII were measured. Since I2 is needed to form the I3− ions for the electron relay at the counter electrode, the addition of 20 wt% I2 to electrolyte B will give electrolyte I for the fabrication of DSSCs. Moreover, by combining electrolyte I and 200 wt% PMII, electrolyte J was also prepared. For comparison, a typical organic liquid electrolyte as a reference device contains 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M I2 in MPN.

The fabrication of the DSSCs was carried out as documented in the previous literature. The cleaned FTO glass was covered at two parallel edges with adhesive tape to control the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film. Two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto the cleaned FTO glass and were used as photoelectrodes. A 10 μm thick film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, a second 5 μm thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering anatase particles was coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 0.3 mM solution of MK-2 in anhydrous toluene at room temperature for 12 h. The dyed TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol were placed onto a cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.

The DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the methanol solution of an electrolyte between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a pre-drilled Pt counter electrode by a 40 μm hot melt ring (Surlyn, DuPont). The resulting cells were placed under vacuum at 50 °C overnight to remove the air to guarantee the optimum filling and fine electrical contact. The produced devices were sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass cover by heating.


1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the synthesized compounds were recorded on a Varian CP-3800 spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Thermal analysis was carried out on a Universal Analysis 2000 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The samples were heated from 50 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of −50 to 200 °C on a DSC-Q200 device.

The XRD patterns of the films were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX-2000 PC diffraction system to evaluate the crystal structure and lattice constants, with the diffraction angle 2θ ranging from 5° to 80°. According to eqn (1), the interlayer distances between the planes in the atomic lattice can be calculated.

λ is the wavelength (=0.154 nm) of the incident beam, θ is the angle between the incident ray and the scattering plane, and n is an integer.

The conductivity of the electrolytes was characterized between two identical platinum sheets (diameter of 1 cm) on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation, using the AC impedance method over the frequency range 0.01 Hz to 105 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV. The conductivity was calculated using eqn (2):

where
σ is the conductivity in S cm−1, R is the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, l is the distance between the two electrodes, and S is the area of the electrolyte.

All the samples were equilibrated for at least 20 min at a given temperature. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminum foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.25 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under a simulated air mass (AM) of 1.5 and solar spectrum illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was plotted as a function of the excitation wavelength and was recorded on a Keithley 2612 source meter under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp with a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 260 1/4). The photoelectrochemical parameters, such as the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated according to the previous reports.

Crown ethers are a class of heterocycles with cyclic oligomers of essential repeating ethyleneoxy(–CH2CH2O–) units. The unique structure of cyclic dioxanes renders crown ethers as complexing agents to effectively bind alkali-metal cations and reduce the interaction strength of their ion pairing. Up to now, crown ethers have been widely used in size-selective ion sensors, phase-transfer catalysts, membrane transport and the disposal of nuclear waste. As one of the simple crown ethers, 12-crown-4 repeats twice in dioxane and four times in its structure. The cavity radius of 12-crown-4 is between 0.060 and 0.075 nm, while the ionic radius of Li+ is 0.060 nm. The excellent trapping and dissociating abilities of 12-crown-4 to Li+ from the Li+ counterion triggered our interest in further exploring the possibility of fabricating a solid-state electrolyte based on [Li∈12-C-4][I], which could free up I− ions and facilitate their effective transfer of charge.


Fig. 1a shows the synthetic route and chemical structure of [Li∈12-C-4][I]. The purity and chemical structure were confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI). Compared with the single peak at 3.71 ppm for 12-crown-4 in CDCl3 (Fig. S1, ESI), introducing LiI leads to three split peaks at 3.86, 3.83 and 1.25 ppm (Fig. S2, ESI), probably because of the non-planar/asymmetric structure of [Li∈12-C-4][I]. In addition, as shown in Fig. S3, the XRD measurements can provide insight into the molecular packing arrangement. The Bragg peaks of 2θ are clearly observed at 20.88 and 18.18° for LiI and [Li∈12-C-4][I], respectively. According to eqn (1), the interlayer distance between the planes in the atomic lattice is calculated to be 4.25 and 4.87 Å for LiI and [Li∈12-C-4][I], respectively. This means that the synthesized [Li∈12-C-4][I] exhibits a larger interlayer distance than LiI. The dissociating and partitioning abilities of the 12-crown-4 ring to LiI are probably responsible for this observation. Furthermore, representative images of the electrolytes are also shown, in Fig. 1b. Impressively, introducing LiI into the clearly liquid 12-crown-4 (sample A) results in a pale-yellow power (electrolyte B), indicating the effective interaction between oxygen atoms and lithium ion to form [Li∈12-C-4][I]. Further addition of I2 results in electrolyte I which contains small crystals of a purple color. It is notable that adding PMII into the electrolytes B and I could effectively suppress the crystallization of the complex to form electrolytes G and J, which are further discussed using DSC and SEM.
The thermal stability of 12-crown-4 and [Li∈12-C-4][I] is also studied in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the initial decomposition temperature (Tonset) of 12-crown-4 is lower than 100 °C, indicative of a poor thermo-stability. Notably, [Li∈12-C-4][I] represents a much higher excellent thermo-stability with a Tonset of 280 °C. Meanwhile, taking account of the carbon residue, the added amount of LiI to 12-crown-4 was further confirmed by the residue mass fraction ∼43.38%, in accordance with the theoretical value of 43.17% for [Li∈12-C-4][I]. These results indicate that the synthesized [Li∈12-C-4][I] indeed offers a high thermal stability, far beyond the range of interest for solid-state electrolytes.
In order to further investigate the thermal properties of sample A and electrolytes B–G, the DSC curves are shown in Fig. 3. The state and melting points are also summarized in Table 1. It was found that the melting point of sample A is 19.8 °C, and that it exists as a colorless liquid at room temperature (Fig. 1b). Notably, electrolyte B containing [Li∈12-C-4][I] is represented by a pale-yellow power (Fig. 1b) with a mp of 64 °C, indicating a strong interaction between 12-crown-4 and LiI. The influence of adding I2 on the melting point of electrolyte I is also shown, in Fig. S4. The value of 64.6 °C indicates that adding I2 can lead to a slightly higher mp than that of electrolyte B, due to the enhanced van der Waals interactions of the polyiodide. Compared with electrolyte B, adding 20 to 40 wt% of PMII to the electrolytes C–E will result in a slightly reduced intensity of the melting point (Fig. 3). Further addition of PMII from 100 to 200 wt% will obviously decrease the melting point intensity. These results demonstrate that liquid state PMII can effectively restrain the crystallization of [Li∈12-C-4][I] and thus introduce the appearance of defected/amorphous regions (Fig. 5b), which is favorable for better ion conductivity from 3.93 × 10−5 to 1.58 × 10−4 S cm−1 as shown in Table 1. However, the various additions of PMII has little effect on the mp values of the prepared solid-state electrolytes. The solid-state property of the crown ether lithium salt complex is also in accordance with the range of application interests for solid-state electrolytes.
As shown in Fig. 4, AC impedance spectroscopy and ionic conductivity tests as a function of temperature were carried out to study the influence of temperature (25–80 °C) on the electrochemical performance of the synthesized [Li∈12-C-4][I]. The conductivity was 3.93 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C. It can been seen that temperature increment gradually reduces the impedance values and hence enhances the ionic conductivity of [Li∈12-C-4][I]. Because of its melting point at 64 °C, higher temperatures will exhibit a liquid state of [Li∈12-C-4][I], resulting in an obvious enhancement of ionic conductivity. Therefore, the solid-state electrolyte shows an ionic conductivity of ∼1.53 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C, displaying a potential application as a novel ionic conductor.
As shown in Fig. 5, the surface morphology of the synthesized [Li∈12-C-4][I] and the PMII doped [Li∈12-C-4][I] materials was further investigated. It was found that [Li∈12-C-4][I] is prone to crystallization and forming voids under ambient conditions (Fig. 5a). The size of the formed crystals is about 5–10 μm. However, the crystallization and voids can greatly prevent the filling of the solid-state electrolytes into the porous TiO2 films, which increases the internal resistance between the electrodes and the electrolyte, and hence destroys dye regeneration and photocurrent generation (e.g. DSSCs). Therefore, the liquid state PMII as a crystal growth inhibitor can effectively restrain the crystal growth of [Li∈12-C-4][I], leading to a relatively smooth surface morphology and improved interfacial wetting properties (Fig. 5b). For these reasons, the electrolytes with a smooth surface morphology will be probably favorable for the fabrication of the solid-state DSSCs in this work.
Based on the above mentioned analysis, the electrolytes I, J, B and G were chosen for the fabrication of the solid-state DSSCs (devices I–IV). The J–V curves of devices I and II with I2 are shown in Fig. 6a. Meanwhile, the J–V curves of devices I and II without I2 are also shown, in Fig. S5 in the ESI. Device III without I2 exhibits a PCE of 1.04% (Jsc = 3.74 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.525 and FF = 0.502). For device I, because of the function of I2 to form I3− ions for effective dye regeneration, the values of Jsc, Voc, and FF are 5.02 mA cm−2, 0.567 and 0.669, respectively, yielding a PCE of 1.90%. Due to the special structure and relatively high ionic conductivity of [Li∈12-C-4][I], the PCE is better than those of the solid-state electrolytes in previous reports. However, as shown in Fig. 5a, extensive crystallization and formed voids can greatly prevent the filling of the solid-state electrolyte into the TiO2 pores. Meanwhile, the poor interfacial contact between the photoanode and the electrolyte also hinders the dye regeneration and ion transport, and hence results in a reduced photocurrent generation. With the assistance of the crystal growth inhibitor PMII to [Li∈12-C-4][I], as shown in Fig. 6a and S5, the PCE of device IV without I2 and device II with I2 can be remarkably improved to 2.77% (Jsc = 9.12 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.604 and FF = 0.502) and 5.05% (Jsc = 11.57 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.627 and FF = 0.696), respectively. This can be ascribed to the much more smooth surface morphology, better interfacial contact, higher ionic conductivity and more effective dye generation. Although the efficiency is slightly lower than that of the reference device with a PCE of 5.72%, it also indicates the comparative performance of a [Li∈12-C-4][I] based device. These results are further demonstrated by the IPCE testing shown in Fig. 6b. The maximum IPCE values are 42.51, 78.72 and 81.4% at 530 nm, indicating a high light harvesting efficiency, effective dye regeneration and charge collection for photoelectron conversion efficiency.
As shown in Fig. 7, the long-term stability of above mentioned devices I and II, and the reference device was further investigated at 60 °C under the same conditions. During this period, device I containing electrolyte I showed a gradual decrease of PCE. After the aging test of 50 days, device I maintained only about 40% of its initial conversion efficiency because of the crystallization and voids of [Li∈12-C-4][I]. However, as expected, device II retains almost over 85% of its initial conversion efficiency, indicating much better, excellent, stability than device I. The employment of PMII to overcome the disadvantages of [Li∈12-C-4][I] crystallization for electrolyte J should be responsible for this stability enhancement. For comparison, the reference device with an organic liquid electrolyte maintains only about 20% of its initial conversion efficiency. These results also offer us a feasible method to design novel solid-state electrolytes for high performance DSSCs for future practical applications.

In summary, a simple and novel crown ether lithium salt complex [Li∈12-C-4][I] has been designed, synthesized and characterized with high purity and yield. The thermal behavior of the [Li∈12-C-4][I] based solid-state electrolytes was also investigated in detail. It revealed that the molecular interaction between the crown ether and lithium iodide can effectively transform the liquid state 12-crown-4 into a solid-state complex [Li∈12-C-4][I] with a melting point of 64 °C, which is in the range of interest for solid-state electrolytes. Particularly, the trapping ability of 12-crown-4 to Li+ can obviously reduce the cation–anion (Li+–I−) interaction and hence facilitate favorable electrical properties of the solid-state electrolytes. Therefore, [Li∈12-C-4][I] exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.93 × 10−5 and 1.53 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 and 80 °C, respectively. Further addition of PMII could effectively suppress the crystallization of the complex for more amorphous and smoother regions, which are much more conducive towards higher ion conductivity by the segmental motion of the molecule chains. Therefore, the resulting device showed a PCE of ∼5% and displayed excellent long-term stability. These results offer us more opportunities to explore simple and novel solid-state electrolytes for electrochemical devices.
