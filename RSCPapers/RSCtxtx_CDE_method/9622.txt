All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) based on an n-type polymer as an acceptor material and a p-type polymer as a donor material have attracted great attention due to their excellent device stability. However, a systematic study of the thermal stability of all-PSCs has not been reported to date. Herein, we developed a highly efficient and thermally stable all-PSCs based on a fluorinated wide-bandgap polymer donor (PFBZ) and a narrow-bandgap polymer acceptor (N2200). The PFBZ:N2200 pair exhibited complementary absorption spectra, matched energy levels, and good blend morphology. As a result, PFBZ:N2200-based devices after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.1% with a high open-circuit voltage of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current density of 13.5 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 67.0%, as well as a low energy loss of 0.56 eV. The efficiency of 8.1% is one of the highest values reported for the additive-free all-PSCs. When the thermal annealing time was extended to 180 min or the temperature was increased to 250 °C, the all-PSCs retained a high PCE of over 7%. These results indicate that the PFBZ:N2200-based all-PSCs with high efficiency and excellent thermal stability are promising candidates for the practical applications of OSCs.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs), which contain bulk heterojunction active layers comprising a polymer donor and a small-molecule (SM) acceptor such as fullerene derivatives or n-type organic semiconductors (n-OSs), have attracted great attention due to their advantages such as large-scale manufacturing ability, semitransparency, and flexibility. Thus far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on fullerene derivatives or n-OSs as acceptors have reached 11% (ref. 11) and 13%, respectively. However, the abovementioned types of PSCs usually exhibit poor thermal stability, which may be due to the self-aggregation of SM acceptors in a high-temperature atmosphere, resulting in lower exciton separation efficiency, reduced charge extraction abilities, and increased charge recombination in devices. Compared with the extensively studied polymer-SM acceptor devices, all-PSCs based on polymer donors and acceptors have active layers with unique morphological stability towards external factors, particularly mechanical and thermal stress, for practical applications as flexible devices in the future. Among these, the n-type conjugated polymer acceptors containing naphthalenediimide and perylenediimide derivatives have been extensively studied for their application in all-PSCs. Thus far, all-PSCs have achieved high PCEs of 8–10%, which was benefited from the development of new polymer donor and acceptor materials and optimization of the devices. For example, Zhang et al. reported an excellent polymer acceptor, namely, PZ1, with a narrow bandgap (NBG), high absorption coefficient, suitable energy levels, high electron mobility, and electron affinity. By matching a wide-bandgap (WBG) polymer donor with a complementary absorption spectrum to that of PZ1, all-PSCs achieved a high PCE of 9.19% with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.05 mA cm−2. Very recently, Huang et al. synthesized a WBG polymer named PTzBI-Si with a siloxane-terminated side chain as the donor for photovoltaic applications and achieved a PCE greater than 10% in all-PSCs for the first time. Although they have many unique advantages and have made great progress, the systematic study of thermal stability of the all-PSCs is still rarely reported.

Thus far, the most widely studied D/A pair in all-PSCs is PTB7-Th:N2200, which has already achieved PCEs greater than 6%. However, the PTB7-Th:N2200 pair has many inherent defects, such as the overlapping absorption spectra, mismatched energy levels, and poor phase separation, resulting in a low Jsc, open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), which severely restrict further improvements in its efficiency. Our previous study has shown that the efficiency of PTB7-Th:N2200-based all-PSCs can be effectively improved from 5.9% to 7.2% by introducing a small amount of the WBG polymer PBDD-ff4T, which has high crystallinity, to induce phase separation of the active layer for optimizing the blend morphologies. However, because a small amount of a third component cannot effectively optimize the optical absorption and energy level of the active layer, the Voc and Jsc values of all-PSCs are not maximized. Therefore, an effective and challenging strategy to increase the efficiency of N2200-based devices comprises the development of binary all-PSCs by matching a WBG polymer donor with high crystallinity and suitable energy levels with N2200.
Recently, researchers have reported a series of WBG polymer donors and narrow bandgap SM acceptors with high crystallinity based on benzotriazole (BTz) as the acceptor unit. Among these, the fluorinated WBG polymer donor named PFBZ with high crystallinity, high extinction coefficient, and suitable energy levels was recently reported by our group. PSCs based on the PFBZ:ITIC blend displayed a high PCE of 10.4%.
Herein, we developed a highly efficient and thermally stable binary all-PSCs based on PFBZ:N2200 as a D/A pair. The PFBZ:N2200 pair has complementary absorption spectra, matched energy levels, and different crystallinities. As expected, PFBZ:N2200-based all-PSCs processed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min achieved a high PCE of 8.1% with a high Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 13.5 mA cm−2 and an FF of 67.0%. The efficiency of 8.1% is one of the highest values reported for additive-free all-PSCs. Notably, the optimal all-PSCs also displayed a low energy loss (Eloss, which is defined as Eoptg − eVoc) of ca. 0.56 eV due to the small optical bandgap (Eoptg, ca. 1.46 eV) of the N2200 film, which is less than the empirical threshold of 0.6 eV. When the thermal annealing time was extended to 180 min at 150 °C, the all-PSCs retained a high PCE of 7.1%. Moreover, after increasing the thermal annealing temperature to 250 °C for 15 min, the all-PSCs retained a PCE greater than 7%. Furthermore, in order to obtain insights into the thermal stability of the devices, the effects of different thermal annealing temperatures and annealing times on the morphology and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the active layer as well as the exciton separation, charge extraction, and recombination behavior of the all-PSCs were studied. Our results indicate that the all-PSCs based on PFBZ:N2200 have high efficiency and excellent thermal stability, and are promising candidates for the practical applications of OSCs.

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymer films and the corresponding blend film are shown in Fig. 1b. The fluorinated polymer PFBZ film displays strong absorption in the wavelength range of ca. 450–630 nm, which complements the absorption spectrum of the NBG polymer N2200 film with two absorption bands in the short-wavelength region of ca. 300–450 nm and the long-wavelength region of ca. 630–850 nm. As a result, the PFBZ:N2200 blend film shows a broad absorption spectrum from ca. 300 nm to 850 nm, which enables the related all-PSCs to capture more photons. It is worth noting that in the spectrum of the blend film, the absorption peaks that correspond to PFBZ are well preserved in comparison with those of the pure PFBZ film, which implies that PFBZ crystallized alone and retained its original crystallinity in the blend film, thus promoting phase separation. Moreover, PFBZ exhibits stronger absorption in comparison to N2200 in the blend film, which is consistent with the high absorption coefficient and crystallinity of PFBZ. The molecular energy levels of the polymers PFBZ and N2200 are summarized in Fig. 1c. The PFBZ:N2200 pair has high ΔEHOMO (HOMOdonor − HOMOacceptor) and ΔELUMO (LUMOdonor − LUMOacceptor) values of 0.37 and 0.70 eV, respectively, which provides a strong driving force for exciton separation at the PFBZ:N2200 interfaces. Moreover, the large gap (ca. 1.24 eV) between HOMOdonor and LUMOacceptor assists the all-PSCs to achieve a high Voc.

All-PSCs with a device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PFBZ:N2200/PDINO/Al were fabricated, and the related preparation processes are summarized in Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI. The chlorobenzene solution of the blend of PFBZ and N2200 (9 mg mL−1) was heated to 100 °C for 20 h and then cooled to 65 °C for 15 min before use. For weight ratios of PFBZ:N2200 ranging from 1.5:1 to 2:1, the all-PSCs exhibited PCEs greater than 5.5% with a high Voc of 0.89–0.90 V. In addition, an optimal PCE of 6.1% was achieved at a weight ratio of 1.75:1. Then, the blend morphology of PFBZ:N2200 (1.75:1) was optimized by thermal annealing treatments. After the active layer was processed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min, the all-PSCs exhibited a significant increase in the Jsc from 11.9 to 13.5 mA cm−2 and a simultaneous remarkable improvement in the FF from 56.7% to 67.0%, while Voc was almost constant at 0.90 V (see Fig. 2a and Table 1). Moreover, the optimal all-PSCs also displayed a low Eloss of ca. 0.56 eV, which is less than the empirical threshold of 0.6 eV. As a result, the all-PSCs achieved an optimal efficiency of 8.1%, which is one of the highest values reported for the additive-free all-PSCs.

The thermal stabilities of the PFBZ:N2200-based all-PSCs were also studied by investigating the photovoltaic performance of the devices for different annealing temperatures and annealing times. As shown in Fig. 2a, with the increase in thermal annealing temperature from 150 °C to an ultrahigh value of 250 °C for 15 min, the all-PSCs exhibited gradual but only a slight decrease in Voc and Jsc. As a result, the all-PSCs that were annealed at a high temperature achieved a high PCE of 7.1% (see Fig. 2d). Moreover, as the thermal annealing time was extended to 180 min at 150 °C, the device efficiency remained at 87.7% and the PCE was greater than 7%, as shown in Fig. 2b and e. Details of the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, the all-PSC devices also displayed excellent storage stability, as shown in Fig. 2c and f. After storing for 1080 h in a glovebox filled with N2, the all-PSCs still achieved an efficiency of ca. 7.0% with a high PCE retention ratio of ca. 86.4%. Details of the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table S2 of the ESI. The above results indicate that the PFBZ:N2200-based all-PSCs have excellent thermal and storage stability.
Moreover, PSCs with different active layer thicknesses in the range of 90–200 nm were fabricated to study the effect of the thickness of the active layer on the device performance (see Fig. S2 and Table S3 in the ESI). With an increase in the thickness of the active layer from ca. 90 nm to 200 nm, the PSCs exhibited an almost unchanged Voc, small fluctuations in Jsc, and a decrease in FF. Notably, when the active layer thickness reached 200 nm, the all-PSCs still achieved a PCE greater than 6%, which is crucial for the practical mass-production of PSCs.
To confirm the Jsc values of the all-PSCs, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured. As shown in Fig. 2g, with an increase in the thermal annealing temperature from 150 °C to 250 °C for 15 min, the EQE response spectra of the devices did not change markedly, regardless of their shape or response value. As shown in Fig. 2h, when the thermal annealing time was extended from 60 min to 180 min at 150 °C, the EQE response spectra of the devices also did not change substantially, although the EQE values were significantly lower than those of the best all-PSCs processed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. Notably, the best all-PSCs displayed a high maximum EQE value of ca. 68% at 550 nm, which indicates that the corresponding device has efficient photon harvesting and charge collection within the cell. The integrated Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves are consistent with those obtained from the J–V tests (see Table 1).
By measuring the plots of Jphversus Veff, the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E, T) were estimated to study the exciton dissociation and charge extraction behavior of the all-PSCs (Fig. 3a and c). The parameter definitions and estimation processes used are presented in detail in the ESI. Under short-circuit and maximal power output conditions, the P(E, T) values were calculated to be 97.1/80.0% and 92.5/64.2% for the as-cast all-PSCs and those annealed at 150 °C for 15 min, respectively, which implies that the annealed all-PSCs have more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction behavior. With an increase in the annealing temperature from 150 °C to 250 °C, the devices showed a gradual but only slight decrease in P(E, T) values from 97.1% to 93.2% for short-circuit conditions and from 80.0% to 76.2% for maximal power output conditions. With the prolongation of the annealing time from 15 to 180 min, the devices also showed only a slight decrease in P(E, T) values from 97.1% to 95.5% for the short-circuit conditions and from 80.0% to 77.0% for the maximal power output conditions. The abovementioned results indicate that an increase in the annealing temperature or prolongation of the annealing time has a negligible effect on the exciton dissociation and charge extraction behavior of the all-PSCs devices in this study.
Moreover, to investigate the charge recombination behavior of the all-PSCs, the effect of P on Jph was studied (Fig. 3b and d). In general, the relation between P and Jph is defined as Jph ∝ PS, and the value of S is close to 1 if the all-PSC has weak bimolecular recombination. The all-PSCs processed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min showed a high S value of 0.990, which is very close to 1 and implies negligible bimolecular recombination and efficient charge transport in the devices. In contrast, the S value for the as-cast devices was 0.958, which indicated the existence of bimolecular recombination to some extent. For the all-PSCs thermally annealed at 150 °C for 15 min, the lower bimolecular recombination agrees well with the higher FF (67.0%) in comparison with that of the as-cast all-PSCs (56.7%). This result is consistent with the fact that the all-PSCs thermally annealed at 150 °C for 15 min possess higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of 8.72/1.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with that of the as-cast all-PSCs (6.22/0.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), as shown in Fig. S3. With an increase in the annealing temperature from 150 to 250 °C or the annealing time from 15 to 180 min, the devices showed gradual decrease in the S values from 0.990 to 0.973 or 0.976, respectively. Notably, all the annealed all-PSCs showed larger S values in comparison with those of the as-cast all-PSCs, which indicates that annealing was beneficial for the reducing bimolecular recombination in the devices in this study.
In order to further understand the high efficiency and high thermal stabilities of the PFBZ:N2200-based all-PSCs, we recorded the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure PFBZ and N2200 polymer films and the corresponding PFBZ:N2200 blend films in different conditions, as shown in Fig. 4. In comparison with the PL spectra of the pure PFBZ or N2200 films, the blend film annealed at 150 °C for 15 min displayed high PL quenching efficiencies greater than 95%, while the as-cast blend film displayed low PL quenching efficiencies of less than 90%. This indicates that the all-PSCs annealed at 150 °C for 15 min have more efficient photoinduced charge transfer behavior between the PFBZ and N2200 polymers in comparison with that of the as-cast devices. The above results are well consistent with the higher EQE values of the all-PSCs annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. Notably, regardless of whether the thermal annealing temperature was increased from 150 to 250 °C or the annealing time was increased from 15 min to 180 min, the blend films showed similar PL spectra. Moreover, the blend films exhibited high PL quenching efficiencies of more than 92% and a slightly decreasing trend in PL quenching efficiency, which is consistent with the high thermal stabilities and slightly decreased PCE values (by ca. 12.3%) of the all-PSCs.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to investigate the molecular packing in the blend films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line-cut profiles in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are shown in Fig. 5. In the neat films, the PFBZ donor showed a dominant face-on orientation with π–π stacking in the out-of-plane direction at 1.73 Å−1, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of which was 2.34 nm, as estimated using the Scherrer equation. The N2200 acceptor also showed a face-on orientation, with a sharp (100) reflection at 0.24 Å−1, a (200) reflection at 0.48 Å−1 in the in-plane direction, and π–π stacking at 1.58 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction. The CCL for (100) plane and π–π stacking were 9.6 nm and 1.5 nm, respectively. When the donor and acceptor were mixed, the crystallinity of N2200 was reduced, as evidenced by the reduced intensity of the (200) peak. The π–π stacking region was composed of diffraction features from both N2200 and PFBZ that could not be separated, and it was hence summarized as a whole to estimate the overall π–π stacking features of the blend film. The broad peak in the low-q region comprised a combination of (100) peaks from the donor and the acceptor; it was also difficult to separate these peaks from each other. However, it could be easily seen in the 2D GIWAXS images that the azimuthal spreading of the (100) diffraction became narrowly distributed toward the reflection horizon upon thermal annealing, particularly at high temperatures, which indicated that more polymer molecules were stacked in a face-on fashion. For the as-cast film, the CCL for the (200) peak of N2200 was 13.45 nm and the CCL of π–π stacking was 1.86 nm. When annealing at 150 °C was performed for 15 min, the blend film displayed a slightly increased CCL of π–π stacking (1.98 nm) and a decreased CCL for the (200) peak of N2200 (12.78 nm). When the annealing time was extended to three hours, the CCL of π–π stacking continued to increase to 2.0 nm, whereas the CCL for the (200) peak of N2200 decreased to 12.38 nm, as shown in Fig. 5d. This trend indicated that thermal annealing at 150 °C reduced the structural order of N2200 but promoted the crystallization of PFBZ. N2200 is known to form nanofibrils in blend films and extended thermal annealing (3 h) can reduce such features, which is seen in the TEM characterizations below. Thermal annealing at 250 °C strongly suppressed the (200) peak of N2200, and the CCL of π–π stacking was estimated to be 2.76 nm. The face-on orientation was much more prominent in this sample, as seen from the narrowly distributed intensities of both the overall π–π peak and the (100) peak. These results indicated that upon annealing at 250 °C the polymer chains started to reorganize with respect to the substrate normal and formed better-packed crystallites. This observation was similar to previous results for N2200 and other liquid-crystal conjugated polymers. The amorphous halo in the diffraction images (ring around 1.3 Å−1) became less distinct for the sample annealed at 250 °C and thus, the overall crystallinity improved. These results revealed the fundamental importance of the details of post-treatment and morphological changes. All-polymer blend films are much more complicated mixtures than polymer-small molecule systems, and correlations with device performance can be more difficult. It is generally regarded that higher crystallinity can be beneficial for charge transport. However, the better-defined packing state and CCL induced by high-temperature annealing led to a decline in efficiency. Thus, selecting the annealing time and temperature to optimize the morphology will be critical. Fig. 5c shows the changes in the normalized area of the (010) peak and their relationship with device performance as a result of the different annealing treatments. Annealing at 150 °C for 15 min led to a slight increase in the area of the (010) peak, which then decreased quickly. These results indicate that annealing for a short time could overcome the hindrances associated with the as-cast thin film by expelling residual solvent and reorganizing the related chain packing to improve the π–π stacking. This step is very important for improving device performance, as seen from the rapid increase in the Jsc and FF.
The effects of different annealing temperatures and annealing times on the surface and bulk morphologies of the PFBZ:N2200 blend films were also studied. As shown in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 6), the as-cast blend film exhibited a large phase separation due to the high crystallinity of the polymer donor PFBZ. After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min, the blend film exhibited a suitable phase separation, with distinct nanonetworks and uniform fiber structures. It is generally believed that a suitable phase separation and fiber structure are beneficial for the Jsc and FF of the devices, respectively. A fibril morphology could also help to improve the charge transport in blend films. With an increase in the annealing temperature from 150 to 250 °C, the blend films still displayed a suitable phase separation, although the fiber structure gradually disappeared, which closely correlated with the changes in the Jsc and FF of the all-PSCs. In contrast, with an increase in the annealing time from 15 to 180 min at 150 °C, the blend films still exhibited fiber structures; however, the texture started to become blurred. Thus, extended annealing reduced the crystallinity of the N2200 component, which closely correlated with the GIWAXS characterization.
As shown in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 7), with an increase in the annealing temperature, the blend films showed a gradually smoother surface and a decrease in root-mean-square roughness (Rq) from 1.24 to 0.78 nm, which is supported by the disappearance of fibrils in the TEM images. When annealing was performed at 150 °C, extending the annealing time from 15 min to 180 min did not change the Rq value (1.08 ± 0.03 nm), but the as-cast blend film showed high roughness due to a large phase separation in the structure.

In conclusion, a highly efficient and thermally stable all-PSC based on the PFBZ:N2200 pair with complementary absorption spectra, matched energy levels, and different crystallinities was produced. PFBZ:N2200-based all-PSCs processed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min achieved a high PCE of 8.1% with a high Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 13.5 mA cm−2, FF of 67.0%, as well as a low Eloss of 0.56 eV. The efficiency of 8.1% is one of the highest values reported for additive-free all-PSCs. When the annealing time was extended to 180 min at 150 °C, the all-PSCs retained a high PCE of 7.1%. Moreover, after the annealing temperature was increased to 250 °C for 10 min, the all-PSCs still retained a PCE of more than 7%. Notably, after storage for 1080 h in an N2-filled glovebox, the all-PSCs still achieved a PCE of ca. 7.0% with a high PCE retention ratio of ca. 86.4%. We also studied the effects of different annealing temperatures and annealing times on the morphology and PL properties of the active layer, as well as the exciton separation, charge extraction, and recombination behavior of the all-PSCs. The results indicate that the PFBZ:N2200-based all-PSCs have high efficiency and excellent thermal stability and, are promising candidates for the practical applications of OSCs.
