A hole-transporting material (HTM) based on (2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole as the core and N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine as the end group (CMO) has been designed. CMO with a simple structure can be synthesized by a one-step process in a high yield and it shows good solubility in solvents. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that CMO has significant charge extraction ability. Planar perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs) based on CMO as the HTM showed a high power conversion efficiency of 15.92%. For reference purposes, pero-SCs based on 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9-9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were fabricated and a PCE of 16.70% was reached. CMO is one of the simplest HTM materials reported, which shows a PCE comparable to that of Spiro-OMeTAD at the same time.

Since Miyasaka and co-workers reported that organometal halide perovskites could be used in solar cells in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of pero-SCs based on ammonium lead halides (such as CH3NH3PbI3) has exceptionally increased rapidly from 3.8% to over 20%. Except for fine-tuning of the perovskite composition and a myriad of fabrication techniques, pursuing suitable HTMs, which extract positive charges from the light absorber and transmit them to the electrode, is another effective strategy to increase the PCE of the pero-SCs. Grimsdale et al. have reported a series of small molecule HTM materials based on 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and a furan core which were obtained via a short, high-yielding synthetic route and possessed PCEs of over 13% in pero-SCs. Murata et al. reported a HTM with a two-dimensional π system around an azulene core which can exhibit a PCE of 16.5% in pero-SCs. Chen et al. have fabricated a dopant-free HTM with a C3h symmetrical truxene core leading to a PCE as high as 18.6%. A PCE of 20.2% was achieved for solution-processable pero-SCs based on a molecularly engineered HTM with an asymmetric fluorine-dithiophene by Nazeeruddin et al. However, the costly Spiro-OMeTAD and even more expensive poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) are still the dominating candidates for HTMs in many labs worldwide which can yield PCEs exceeding 20%. Therefore, exploring simple, low-cost and efficient molecule HTMs is still vital to enhancing the efficiency and stability of pero-SCs, and to realizing commercialization.

We designed a simple molecule HTM (Scheme 1), by introducing (2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole as the core and N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine as the end group, hereafter called CMO. By one step of Buchwald–Hartwig reaction through bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine and 2,7-dibromo-9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole which are commercially available starting materials, CMO can be synthesized easily. CMO has good solubility in most solvents. Planar pero-SCs fabricated with CMO as the HTM showed a high PCE of 15.92%, with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 25.19 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.93 V and a fill factor (FF) of 67.9%.

Compound CMO: a solution of bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine (1.145 g, 2.5 equiv.), 2,7-dibromo-9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole (0.874 g, 2 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (36.6 mg, 0.02 equiv.), tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate (17.34 mg, 0.03 equiv.) and sodium tert-butoxide (0.576 g, 3 equiv.) was added into anhydrous toluene (35 mL) and the solution was refluxed under an argon atmosphere for 12 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite, 100 mL of distilled water were added and the extraction was done with ethyl acetate. The organic phase of the crude product was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The purification of the product was accomplished by column chromatography (neutral alumina, 12:1 (v/v), petroleum ether/ethyl acetate). The obtained solid was dissolved in warm acetone and recrystallized in methanol. The precipitate was filtered and washed with cold methanol to collect CMO as a faint yellow solid (0.97 g, 65.9%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, acetone-d6), ppm: 7.78 (d, 2H), 7.05 (m, 8H), 6.90–6.86 (m, 8H), 6.76 (q, 2H), 3.83 (d, 2H), 3.77 (s, 12H), 1.70 (m, 1H), 1.20 (m, 8H), 0.79 (t, 3H), 0.72 (t, 3H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, acetone-d6), ppm: 11.32, 14.41, 23.73, 25.29, 31.93, 40.33, 47.19, 55.85, 103.10, 115.60, 118.48, 120.68, 126.95, 142.73, 143.26, 147.65, 156.77. C48H51N3O4 exact mass (733.39), MS (MADI-TOF) (733.3).


The one step synthetic route to CMO is shown in Scheme 1. CMO can be obtained by Buchwald–Hartwig reaction with a yield of over 80%. More detailed data on the synthesis can be found in the ESI (Fig. S1–S3). CMO has good solubility in most organic solvents like toluene and chlorobenzene, which is an important factor for solution processing techniques. The thermal stability of CMO was investigated and the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot is shown in Fig. 1. The temperature at which 5% weight loss is recorded for CMO is 325 °C, indicating that the stability of CMO is good enough for applications in pero-SCs.



Fig. 2. shows the UV-vis absorption and transmittance of the CMO film. The π–π* absorption bands of CMO is observed at around 391 nm and an absorption edge (λedge) is displayed at around 418 nm. The optical bandgap of CMO was calculated to be 2.96 eV from the equation (Eoptg)film = 1240/λedge. It is nearly transparent (>90%) in the visible region between 420–700 nm. The UV-vis absorption of the Spiro-OMeTAD film is also shown in Fig. 2. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, the absorption edge of CMO is almost the same, which indicates that CMO exhibits a similar optical bandgap to Spiro-OMeTAD. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry of CMO was carried out in acetonitrile solution (Fig. 3a) to measure the energy levels of CMO. The onset oxidation potential (Eoxonset) of CMO was estimated to be 0.07 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level was determined to be −4.78 eV on the basis of the equation: EHOMO = −e(Eoxonset + 4.71) (eV). And the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was calculated to be −1.82 eV from the optical bandgap according to the equation: LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg. Fig. 3b shows the energy level diagram and the energy level of CMO is suitable for its application as a HTM in planar pero-SC devices. But the higher HOMO energy level of CMO may lead to a lower VOC of the corresponding pero-SC devices compared with Sipro-OMeTAD (HOMO: −5.13 eV vs. Fc/Fc+).


The surface wettability of the CMO layer was also investigated. In CMO, the 2-ethylhexyl group was introduced on the nitrogen-atom of carbazole, which can modulate the HTM surface energy as a nonpolar, flexible chain. As a result, the as-cast CMO film exhibits a larger contact angle of 92.5° to a water droplet, compared with the contact angle of 80.0° for the Spiro-OMeTAD which has no aliphatic chain in the structure (Fig. S4, ESI). The contact angle to a water droplet indicates that CMO can protect perovskite from moisture in the air better than Spiro-OMeTAD, which would improve the stability of perovskite solar cells.


The charge carrier mobility of hole-transporting materials is another important property that impacts the PCEs of pero-SCs. The hole mobility of the CMO films was measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/CMO/MoO3/Al. The result was plotted as (current density)1/2vs. voltage, as shown in Fig. 4. The hole mobility of CMO is 1.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 as also listed in Table 1, which is lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (between 10−5 and 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1). The relatively low hole mobility of CMO may negatively influence the performance of the pero-SCs.

In order to investigate the performance of CMO as the HTM in planar pero-SCs, we fabricated pero-SCs with the device structure of FTO/compact-TiO2 (∼50 nm)/perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (∼400 nm)/HTM-CMO (∼50 nm)/Au (∼80 nm). The hole-transport layer was spin-coated on top of CH3NH3PbI3 with different concentrations of CMO without a dopant. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve for the best device based on CMO is shown in Fig. 5. As the concentration of CMO in chlorobenzene is decreased from 45.68 to 19.63 mg mL−1, the pero-SC device exhibited the best PCE value of 13.48%, with a JSC of 21.95 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.93 V and a FF of 66.27%. Under the same conditions, the pero-SC device with the classic Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM can reach a PCE of 16.7%, with a JSC of 22.32 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.02 V and a FF of 72.75% (Fig. S5, ESI). When the concentration of CMO was 22.84 mg mL−1, we fabricated the pero-SC devices repeatedly without other optimization conditions. The best performances of the pero-SC devices resulted in a PCE value of 15.92%, with a JSC of 25.19 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.93 V and a FF of 67.9%, which is a high value for the pero-SC devices based on the novel organic HTM without a dopant. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, CMO is much simpler in structure and cheaper in synthetic cost, which indicates that CMO is a very promising alternative material to Spiro-OMeTAD. However, the PCE of the pero-SCs based on CMO is still lower, which can be attributed to the low hole mobility of CMO. Adjusting the structure of the HTM mildly for the enhancement of the hole mobility will be the key point in the future work. The photovoltaic parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 2. The efficiency histogram (Fig. S6, ESI) shows that about 80% of the devices (among 30 devices) have a PCE higher than 11%, which indicates the good reproducibility of the pero-SC devices based on CMO.

We also investigated the AFM (atomic force microscopy) images of the CMO films spin-coated on top of perovskite with different concentrations. The concentration of CMO was chosen to be 45.68 mg ml−1, 22.84 mg ml−1 and 19.63 mg ml−1, which corresponded to the images of the CMO films in Fig. 6a, b and c, respectively. The RMS values were 11.2 nm, 4.60 nm and 14.8 nm for the CMO films spin-coated at concentrations of 45.68 mg ml−1, 22.84 mg ml−1 and 19.63 mg ml−1, respectively. Although the morphology of the perovskite layer will affect that of the CMO layer, it can still be shown that the morphology of the CMO films spin-coated with the concentration of 22.84 mg ml−1 was more uniform than those with the concentrations of 45.68 mg ml−1 and 19.63 mg ml−1. There were many flaws and big aggregations in the images of the CMO film spin-coated at concentrations of 45.68 mg ml−1 and 19.63 mg ml−1, which were fatal to the charge transport and inhibited the attainment of the high PCE of the corresponding pero-SCs. A typical cross section image of the pero-SC with CMO as the HTM measured using SEM (scanning electron microscopy) is shown in Fig. 6d. A well-defined hybrid structure with clear interfaces was observed.


To further investigate and understand the charge dynamics in the pero-SCs with CMO as the HTM, steady-state PL and time-resolved PL measurements were carried out. To make a parallel comparison, the samples were fabricated with the same batch of materials under the same conditions to make sure that the film thicknesses of the perovskite and the HTM layer were at the same level. Steady-state PL data of CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3/CMO and CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 7a. The perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) film itself gives an emission band peak at around 785 nm. A distinct PL quenching was observed when the HTM layer (CMO and Spiro-OMeTAD) was introduced. The observation of PL quenching indicates that an efficient charge transfer has occurred at the interface of the perovskite/HTM layers. Compared to Spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 58%), the CMO coated perovskite film shows a slightly better PL quenching efficiency (ca. 59%), indicating that CMO presented excellent charge carrier extraction ability equivalent to that of Spiro-OMeTAD. The PL quenching studies provide an explanation for the high JSC of the CMO based pero-SC devices. Time-resolved PL measurements were monitored at the perovskite emission peak of 785 nm for CH3NH3PbI3/CMO and CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD, and the results are shown in Fig. 7b. CMO coated CH3NH3PbI3 exhibited a fast decay component τ1 of about 0.52 ns and a fast decay component τ2 of about 2.49 ns. And for CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD, τ1 is about 10.97 ns and τ2 is about 0.83 ns. This indicates that the charge pairs generated under illumination in the perovskite were efficiently separated at the interface and then transferred to the HTM. And the PL data indicate that CMO and Spiro-OMeTAD have comparable hole extraction ability which further proves the high JSC of the CMO based pero-SC devices.


In conclusion, a simple dopant-free HTM, introducing (2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole as the core and N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine as the end group(CMO), has been designed. CMO was synthesized by a one-step process and it showed good solubility in most solvents and was almost transparent in films. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that CMO has significant charge extraction ability equivalent to that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Planar pero-SCs fabricated with CMO as the HTM without a dopant showed a high PCE of 15.92%. The concentration of CMO in chlorobenzene has an impact on the morphology of the corresponding film and the PCE of the pero-SC device. For reference purposes, pero-SCs with Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM were fabricated and a PCE of 16.70% was reached. CMO is one of the simplest HTM materials reported, which shows a comparable PCE to Spiro-OMeTAD at the same time.
