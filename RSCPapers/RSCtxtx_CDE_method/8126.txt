Opaque and semitransparent polymer solar cells (PSCs) were prepared with the narrow band gap donor PTB7-Th and the ultra-narrow band gap acceptor IEICO-4F by optimizing their doping ratios. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of opaque PSCs can be maintained at over 11% by altering PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.4:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt), along with a red-shifted absorption edge of active layers. The red-shifted absorption edge should be attributed to IEICO-4F molecular aggregation due to the relatively increased IEICO-4F content in active layers. The increased photon harvesting in the near infrared light range due to IEICO-4F molecular aggregation and decreased photon harvesting in the visible light range with lower PTB7-Th content provide great potential to prepare efficient semitransparent PSCs. The semitransparent PSCs were prepared with 1 nm Au/11 nm Ag replacing 100 nm Al as the electrode. The average visible transmittance (AVT) of semitransparent PSCs is increased from 23.7% to 27.1% by decreasing the PTB7-Th content in active layers, along with a slight PCE decrease from 9.48% to 9.06% and a lower cost. The optimized 9.06% PCE and 27.1% AVT should be impressive values for semitransparent PSCs. This work may provide a smart strategy to achieve efficient semitransparent PSCs with low cost by decreasing the narrow band gap donor content in active layers.

Rapid progress in polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved with efficient narrow or ultra-narrow band gap materials as active layers for sufficient photon harvesting in the long wavelength range. Meanwhile, narrow band gap non-fullerene materials also have a relatively high absorption coefficient in the near infrared light range. It is known that most of the polymer donors have a relatively large optical band gap compared with small molecular non-fullerene acceptors, exhibiting relatively strong photon harvesting in the visible light range. Meanwhile, stretched polymer chains may provide efficient hole transport channels in films, which can be achieved from dilute solutions with low polymer content. The stretched polymer chains may be beneficial to form a well-ordered molecular arrangement; small molecular acceptors may adhere to the chains of the well-ordered polymer to form bi-continuous interpenetrated networks. The donor and acceptor blend films with low polymer content should have great potential in preparing efficient semitransparent PSCs because the transmittance of blend films can be enhanced by appropriately decreasing the polymer content, also maintaining efficient charge transport in the blend films. Recently, ultra-narrow band gap materials have been commonly reported for achieving efficient PSCs, which also provide more opportunities to fabricate efficient semitransparent PSCs with additional parameters such as average visible transmittance (AVT, from 370 nm to 740 nm). Here, the typical advances of semitransparent nonfullerene PSCs are summarized in Table 1. According to the basic knowledge, the sum of EQE and transmittance values should be less than 85% in the whole spectral range, which is an objective parameter to evaluate semitransparent PSCs. It is known that most of the efficient opaque PSCs also exhibit less than 85% EQE values in the whole spectral range because exciton and charge loss are inevitable in any well-optimized active layers.

In this work, narrow or ultra-narrow band gap materials PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F were employed to prepare opaque and semitransparent PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/100 nm Al (1 nm Au/11 nm Ag). The schematic diagram of semitransparent PSCs and the chemical structures of used materials are exhibited in Fig. S1. The only difference is the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F doping weight ratio, which is varied from 1.5:1.5 to 0.5:1.5 (wt/wt). The PCEs of opaque PSCs can be maintained at over 11% by altering PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.4:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt). It is worth highlighting that the photon harvesting in the visible light range can be gradually decreased by decreasing the PTB7-Th content in active layers, also exhibiting a slightly red-shifted absorption edge, which should be beneficial to prepare efficient semitransparent PSCs. A PCE of 9.48% and AVT of 23.7% are achieved from semitransparent PSCs with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (1.2:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer. The AVT of semitransparent PSCs is increased to 27.1% with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (0.8:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer with a PCE of 9.06%, corresponding to over 14.3% AVT improvement and less than 4.5% PCE loss. Meanwhile, the cost of semitransparent PSCs can be decreased due to the decreased consumption of PTB7-Th. This work may provide a new strategy for achieving efficient semitransparent PSCs with low cost by decreasing the polymer donor content in active layers.

The normalized absorption spectra of neat PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F films are shown in Fig. 1a. It is apparent that the photon harvesting range of the neat PTB7-Th film is mainly located in the visible light range with an absorption peak at 700 nm. The neat IEICO-4F film exhibits a strong photon harvesting in the near infrared light range with an absorption peak at 865 nm. The small absorption spectral overlap between PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F is beneficial to increase photon harvesting of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend films in the solar light range. The absorption spectra of blend films with different PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.5:1.5 to 0.5:1.5 (wt/wt) were measured, as shown in Fig. 1b. The film thicknesses of the blend films with different PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios were optimized by controlling the spin speed of the spin-coating process. The thickness of all active layers is about 100 nm. The slightly decreased photon harvesting in the visible light range and slightly increased photon harvesting in the near infrared range (NIR) can be simultaneously observed along with a PTB7-Th content decrease in blend films, exhibiting great potential in preparing efficient semitransparent PSCs. Meanwhile, the absorption edge of blend films is slightly red-shifted along with the PTB7-Th content decrease in the active layers, which should result from IEICO-4F aggregation in the active layers with an IEICO-4F relative content increase. To optimize the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F doping weight ratio for achieving efficient PSCs, a series of opaque PSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/100 nm Al. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of all PSCs are shown in Fig. 1c. It is apparent that the short circuit current density (Jsc) values of PSCs are slightly increased and then decreased along with a PTB7-Th content decrease in active layers, which is mainly codetermined by photon harvesting and phase separation of active layers. It should be highlighted that FFs of PSCs are increased and then decreased along with a PTB7-Th content decrease in active layers; a fill factor (FF) of 69.44% is achieved in PSCs with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (0.8:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer. The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were calculated according to the J–V curves of all opaque PSCs, and the detailed values are listed in Table 2. It is apparent that the Rs values are decreased and then increased along with a PTB7-Th content decrease in active layers, and the other parameter, Rsh, values are opposite. The increased FF can be well supported by the minimum Rs and maximum Rsh of the PSCs with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (0.8:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer. Efficient hole transport channels should be achieved in the active layer prepared with the more stretched PTB7-Th chains in low concentration solutions, meanwhile, IEICO-4F may prefer to adhere onto the chains of PTB7-Th to form bi-continuous charge transport channels for obtaining markedly enhanced FFs. The open circuit voltage (Voc) values of PSCs are slightly decreased from 0.729 V to 0.708 V along with a PTB7-Th content decrease. Hou et al. also reported a similar phenomenon in PIDTDTQx:PC70BM based PSCs, which may be due to the decreased LUMO-level of aggregated acceptors in active layers. The PCEs of PSCs are also increased and then decreased along with a PTB7-Th content decrease, PCEs of over 11% are achieved in PSCs with the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.4:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt), resulting from three well-balanced photovoltaic parameters. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 1d. The red-shifted EQE spectra can also be clearly observed, which should be attributed to IEICO-4F aggregation in active layers with a low PTB7-Th content. The calculated Jscs are obtained by integrating the EQE spectra, which also exhibit an increased and then decreased trend along with a PTB7-Th content decrease. The red-shifted EQE spectra should be beneficial to prepare efficient semitransparent PSCs due to the enhanced photon harvesting in the NIR region. All the photovoltaic parameters and calculated Jscs are summarized in Table 2. The errors between the measured Jscs and the calculated Jscs are less than 5%, which mainly results from the performance decay during the EQE spectral measurement on the unencapsulated PSCs. It should be highlighted that the production of PSCs can be economized due to the decreased consumption of PTB7-Th. The PCE of PSCs can be increased from 10.58% to 11.55% or 11.1% by decreasing the PTB7-Th content in active layers, also corresponding to about 10% or 23% cost saving, respectively.

To further investigate the effect of PTB7-Th content on EQE spectra of PSCs, the EQE spectral differences between PSCs with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (1.5:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer and PSCs with low PTB7-Th content in active layers are exhibited in Fig. 2a. It is apparent that the EQE values of PSCs are markedly decreased in the visible light range along with a PTB7-Th content decrease in active layers, which can be well explained from the absorption spectra of blend films. Meanwhile, EQE values are slightly increased in the long wavelength range with the red-shifted EQE spectra, which is attributed to the increased IEICO-4F content and IEICO-4F molecular aggregation. To gain deep insight into photon harvesting and exciton utilization of active layers with different PTB7-Th contents, photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of typical PSCs were investigated and are shown in Fig. 2b. Obviously, the Jph of all PSCs can rapidly reach a saturated state under an effective voltage of 0.3 V. The detailed descriptions are given in the ESI. The detailed experimental values of typical PSCs are listed in Table S1. The exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) of typical PSCs are listed in the inset of Fig. 2b. The PSCs exhibit a monotonously decreased ηdiss due to the less dissociation interface along with a PTB7-Th content decrease. Meanwhile, the slightly increased and then decreased ηcoll can be observed along with a PTB7-Th content decrease, suggesting that bicontinuous charge transport networks can be achieved by adjusting the PTB7-Th content in the active layers. It is highlighted that the ηcoll variation trend accords well with the FF variation trend of PSCs which is dependent on the PTB7-Th content in active layers.
The charge transport process in the active layers with different PTB7-Th contents can be investigated according to the J–V curves of PSCs under different light illumination intensities, as shown in Fig. S2. The relationship between Jsc and light intensity can be expressed as Jsc = Plightn, which is abstracted from the J–V curves of PSCs under different light intensities, as described in Fig. 3a. If the factor n is close to 1, it indicates efficient charge extraction prior to recombination in active layers. The factor n values are increased from 0.894 to 0.925 along with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.5:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt), suggesting that efficient charge transport channels can be well formed in the active layers with a PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratio of 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt). The n value is slightly decreased to 0.918 for the active layers with a PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratio of 0.5:1.5 (wt/wt), which may be due to the more unbalanced charge mobility. The variation trend of n values can well explain the dependence of FFs of PSCs on PTB7-Th content. To further investigate charge transport characteristics of blend films with different PTB7-Th contents, charge mobilities of blend films were measured according to the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only or electron-only devices were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag or ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al, respectively. The ln(Jd3/V2) versus (V/d)0.5 curves of hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S3. The hole mobility (μh), electron mobility (μe) and μh/μe ratios of corresponding devices are listed in the inset of Fig. 3b. The μh and μe values are increased from 4.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.43 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F = 1.5:1.5, wt/wt) to 5.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F = 0.5:1.5, wt/wt), respectively, suggesting that charge transport can be optimized by adjusting PTB7-Th content in active layers. The balance of hole and electron transport can be evaluated according to the μh/μe value; the μh/μe values are decreased and close to 1 along with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.5:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt). The μh/μe values are decreased to 0.59 in the active layer with a PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratio of 0.5:1.5, resulting from the excessively aggregated acceptors in active layers.
It is known that the phase separation degree of active layers plays a vital role in determining exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out to investigate the effect of PTB7-Th content on phase separation of active layers, as shown in Fig. 4. The homogeneous distribution can be observed from the TEM image of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F(1.5:1.5, wt/wt) blend films. The nano-fibril feature can be clearly observed for the blend films with low PTB7-Th content due to the more stretched PTB7-Th chains prepared from low concentration solutions, and IEICO-4F may prefer to adhere onto the more stretched chains of PTB7-Th to form efficient bicontinuous charge transport channels in blend films. Appropriate phase separation is beneficial for charge transport in active layers, resulting in weak charge recombination and high FF of the corresponding PSCs. The PCEs of PSCs are more than 11% with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F from 1.4:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt) as active layers, because the decreased Jscs and Vocs can be well compensated by the increased FFs along with a PTB7-Th content decrease in active layers. Semitransparent PSCs were prepared with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F from 1.2:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt) as active layers and 1 nm Au/11 nm Ag as the electrode by replacing 100 nm Al. The J–V curves of the semitransparent PSCs were measured under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 5a.
In comparison with the opaque PSCs, a similar variation trend of Jsc, Voc and FF of semitransparent PSCs depending on PTB7-Th content in active layers is observed. The Jscs of semitransparent PSCs are much lower than those of the corresponding opaque PSCs, which is mainly due to photon loss from the ultrathin Au/Ag electrode. The FFs of semitransparent PSCs are slightly lower than those of opaque PSCs, presumably due to the relatively low conductivity of the ultrathin Au/Ag electrode. The transmission spectra of the glass/ITO substrate, 1 nm Au/11 nm Ag ultrathin electrode, active layers with buffer layers and semitransparent PSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 5b. The detailed AVT values are listed in Table S2. The relationship of AVT values is described in detail in the ESI. The Au/Ag electrode exhibits high transmittance in the spectral range from 300 nm to 650 nm, which is beneficial to prepare semitransparent PSCs. The relatively high transmittance of the Au/Ag electrode also results in photon loss in this spectral range. It is highlighted that the transmittance of the Au/Ag electrode is rather low in the long wavelength range, which is propitious to enhance the interference effect between incident light and reflected light from the Au/Ag electrode and improve photon harvesting of IEICO-4F in active layers. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of semitransparent PSCs are summarized in Table 3. The AVT values of semitransparent PSCs are increased from 23.7% to 27.1% along with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.2:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt), corresponding to over 14.3% AVT improvement and less than 4.5% PCE loss. The PCEs of semitransparent PSCs are slightly decreased from 9.48% to 9.06% with the advantage of cost saving. According to the transmission spectra of active layers with buffer layers and semitransparent PSCs, the semitransparent electrode should be further developed with high transmittance in the visible light range and low transmittance in the NIR region. The EQE spectra of corresponding semitransparent PSCs are shown in Fig. 5c. The EQE values of corresponding semitransparent PSCs are decreased in the visible light range due to the decreased PTB7-Th content in the active layer. Quantum utilization efficiency (QUE), an objective parameter, was proposed to evaluate the PCE and AVT of semitransparent PSCs, which is defined as the sum of EQE and transmittance of semitransparent PSCs. The detailed information is provided in the ESI. The QUE spectra of semitransparent PSCs are also shown in Fig. 5c. The QUE values of semitransparent PSCs are below 80% in the whole spectral range, which results from the inevitable photon and charge loss. The reported PCE and AVT of semitransparent PSCs should be acceptable because the QUE values are less than 80% in the whole spectral range. The Comission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 color coordinates of the transmitted light under an ordinary white LED were measured and are shown in Fig. 5d. The color rendering index (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of the ST-PSCs are summarized in Table S3. The CRI of the ordinary white LED is (0.3209, 0.3364) with a CCT 6037 K. The CRI values of the corresponding devices with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (1.2:1.5, 1.0:1.5 and 0.8:1.5, wt/wt) as active layers are (0.2650, 0.2996), (0.2680, 0.2990) and (0.2694, 0.2920), corresponding to a CCT of 11053 K, 10746 K and 11073 K, respectively. The experimental results indicate that white light performance is more prominent for the semitransparent PSCs with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (0.8:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer. This work may provide a new strategy for achieving efficient semitransparent PSCs with low cost by decreasing the donor content in active layers.

In summary, opaque and semitransparent PSCs were prepared with the narrow band gap donor PTB7-Th and the ultra-narrow band gap acceptor IEICO-4F. The PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F weight ratios were optimized to achieve efficient opaque PSCs with 100 nm Al as the electrode. The PCEs of opaque PSCs can be maintained at over 11% by altering PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F ratios from 1.4:1.5 to 0.8:1.5 (wt/wt). It is worth highlighting that the photon harvesting in visible light range can be gradually decreased by decreasing the PTB7-Th content in active layers, also exhibiting a slightly red-shifted absorption edge, which should be beneficial to prepare efficient semitransparent PSCs. The semitransparent PSCs were prepared with 1 nm Au/11 nm Ag replacing 100 nm Al as the electrode. A PCE of 9.48% and AVT of 23.7% are achieved from the semitransparent PSCs with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (1.2:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer. The AVT value of semitransparent PSCs is increased to 27.1% with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (0.8:1.5, wt/wt) as the active layer with a PCE of 9.06%, corresponding to over 14.3% AVT improvement and less than 4.5% PCE loss. Meanwhile, the cost of semitransparent PSCs can be reduced due to the lower consumption of PTB7-Th. This work may provide a new strategy for achieving efficient semitransparent PSCs with acceptable PCE and AVT, as well as low cost by decreasing polymer donor consumption.
