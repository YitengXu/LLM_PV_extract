A new method based on a palladium-catalyzed tandem reaction for the fast construction of a dianthraceno[a,e]pentalene (DAP) framework is developed, which gave a series of dianthraceno[a,e]pentalenes with good functional group tolerance, and it should be highlighted that five C–C bonds were formed in one reaction. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of DAP derivatives were examined in detail. Interestingly, cross conjugation can be observed for DAPs substituted with electron-withdrawing substituents, which results in decreased optical bandgaps and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. Because of the good absorption features, high fluorescence quantum yield and appropriate frontier energy levels, dianthraceno[a,e]pentalene with a p-((2-hexyldecyl)-2-cyanoacetate)phenyl group (DAP-PhCA) was utilized for solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells, which delivered a power conversion efficiency of 2.05% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 0.95 V.

Diaceno[a,e]pentalenes represented by dibenzo[a,e]pentalenes (DBP), known for over 100 years, have recently attracted considerable interest because of their application potential in organic opto/electronic devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFET) and organic photovoltaics (OPV), which can be attributed to the intrinsically higher electron affinity and better stability than their acene counterparts. The rapid developments of synthetic methodology make it easy for accessing these stable pentalene derivatives. Kawase, Tilley Itami and Zhuet al. developed tandem synthesis of dibenzo[a,e]pentalenes by the homocoupling of o-alkynylaryl halides or arylacetylenes catalyzed by Ni or Pd catalysts. These prompt developments on synthetic methodology further promote related research studies on their applications in organic electronics. In 2010, Kawase et al. demonstrated the first application of dinaphtho[a,e]pentalenes (DNP) in OFET and OPV, which delivered decent performance with a hole mobility of 1.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.94%. Afterwards, DBP was utilized as a building block for the development of conjugated polymers that showed a hole mobility over 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 depending on the incorporation manner. By extending π-conjugation, dianthraceno[a,e]pentalenes (DAP) showed hole mobilities up to 0.86 cm2 V−1 s−1 in thin-film transistors and 6.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 in single-crystal transistors. By incorporating imide groups into the DBP/DNP framework, diacenopentalene dicarboximides were found to be electron-transporting semiconductors with electron mobilities up to 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Although the OPV applications of DNP derivatives have been demonstrated as an electron donor, we envisioned that DAPs might be even more promising in terms of the unexpectedly high luminescence properties, long-wavelength absorption and high hole mobility. In 2014, we reported the first DAP by utilizing a unique catalytic system, Pd(OAc)2/n-Bu4NOAc, and elucidated its unusually high fluorescence. As shown in Scheme 1, DAP was synthesized from 2,3-dibromoanthracene by three steps. In this work, we developed a new one-step palladium-catalyzed synthesis of DAP derivatives directly from 2,3-dibromoanthracene and tributyl(arylethynyl)stannanes. Despite the apparently low 9–16% yields, five bonds were formed simultaneously to give the pentalene structure, which significantly simplified the synthetic route toward DAPs. With this new methodology, five DAP derivatives with different aryl substitutes were synthesized. For OPV applications, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level should be suitable for achieving a high open-circuit voltage (Voc). Thus, we designed and synthesized DAP-PhCA with the strong electron-withdrawing p-((2-hexyldecyl)-2-cyanoacetate)phenyl substituent that can not only decrease the HOMO energy level of the electron-rich DAP framework but also further narrow the optical bandgap. DAP-PhCA-based OPVs exhibited a considerably high Voc of 0.95 eV and a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.05%.

In 2014, we developed a unique catalytic system, Pd(OAc)2/n-Bu4NOAc, for the efficient synthesis of diaceno-[a,e]pentalenes, which, however, goes through a three-step reaction and especially, is not suitable for DAPs with electron-withdrawing groups. In order to systematically explore the impact of aryl substituents possessing different electronic properties on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of DAPs, a new method that is more feasible with wider substrate tolerance is necessary. Fortunately, we found that the toluene solution of 2,3-dibromoanthracene and 2-hexyldecyl 4-((tributylstannyl)ethynyl)benzoate in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 can furnish DAP-PhCOOHD directly after refluxing overnight. The reaction conditions were optimized by varying Pd catalysts, solvents, ligands, temperature and reaction time. Finally, we can obtain DAP-PhCOOHD in 9% yield in one step under the reaction conditions of 5 mol% Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, 1.5 equivalents of 2-hexyldecyl 4-((tributylstannyl)ethynyl)benzoate, and toluene as the solvent, at 140 °C for 48 h. The applicability of the method has been examined to produce DAP derivatives with aryl substituents of different electronic properties. Treatment of 2,3-dibromoanthracene and different aryl substituents under these optimized conditions furnished the corresponding dianthraceno[a,e]pentalenes DAP-PhBu, DAP-PhH, DAP-PhOHD and DAP-PhP in 12–16% yields (Scheme 2). Taking into account that five C–C bonds were formed in one reaction, the yields are actually fairly good. Interestingly, this new method is specifically suitable for the synthesis of DAP derivatives, which cannot be expanded for DBP and DNP. DAP-PhP was subjected to pinacol deprotection and Knoevenagel condensation with (2-hexyldecyl)2-cyanoacetate to generate DAP-PhCA in 76% yield. DAP-PhCA is a black solid and exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, which is desirable for applications in solution-processed organic opto/electronic devices.


With DAP derivatives in hand, we investigated their photophysical and electrochemical properties by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (Table 1). The UV-vis absorption spectra of DAP derivatives in dilute dichloromethane solution are shown in Fig. 1a. The low energy band appears at very similar wavelengths for all DAP derivatives ranging from 515 to 556 nm except for DAP-PhCOOHD and DAP-PhCA. Compared with DAP-PhH, the electron-withdrawing ester group in DAP-PhCOOHD and (2-hexyldecyl)-2-cyanoacetate substituent in DAP-PhCA induced significant bathochromic shifts of 24 and 72 nm to 604 and 652 nm, respectively, which can be attributed to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer. The band gaps of all dianthraceno[a,e]pentalene derivatives were determined from the onset of the longest absorptions, which are listed in Table 1. All the DAP derivatives also showed intense fluorescence in dichloromethane solution with the maxima ranging from 577 to 665 nm, and the fluorescence quantum yields of DAP-PhOHD, DAP-PhBu, DAP-PhH, DAP-PhCOOHD, DAP-PhCA are 44.7%, 44.9%, 45.0%, 47.5% and 32.3%, respectively (Fig. 1d and Table 1). Cyclic voltammograms of dianthraceno[a,e]pentalene derivatives are shown in Fig. 2a and are summarized in Table 1. All DAP derivatives showed reversible amphoteric redox behaviour. The redox potentials are affected by the electronic characters of the substituents. Aryl groups with the electron-withdrawing ability, DAP-PhCOOHD and DAP-PhCA, lead to a positive shift in reduction and oxidation processes relative to DAP-PhH, while this trend is reversed for DAP-PhOHD with stronger electron-donating ones. Besides, compared with DAP-PhH and DAP-PhBu with the single redox process, compounds DAP-PhCOOHD and DAP-PhCA showed two reduction peaks and DAP-PhOHD showed two oxidation peaks, which is also related to the electronic effect of aryl substituents and is consistent with the tendency of redox potentials. According to the first oxidation and reduction waves, the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels can be determined as indicated in Table 1. The cyanoacetate substituent significantly lowers the oxidation potential and hence the HOMO energy level of DAP-PhCA is downshifted to −5.31 eV, which is appropriate to obtain a high Voc for photovoltaic applications. According to theoretical calculations at B3LYP/6-31G** level, the maximum absorption of DAPs can be ascribed to the HOMO–LUMO excitation, 542.92 (f: 0.5030, DAP-PhOHD), 545.93 (f: 0.4872, DAP-PhH), 585.69 (f: 0.4701, DAP-PhCOOMe) and 703.14 (f: 0.3454, DAP-PhCA). As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO orbitals of all DAPs are mainly localized on the DAP framework.

By contrast, the LUMO orbitals from DAP-PhOHD to DAP-PhCA are gradually shifted to the aryl substituents at the bridge positions, which results in the decreased HOMO and LUMO energy levels, enhanced intramolcular charge transfer and agrees well with their bathochromic shifts, i.e., the reduced energy bandgaps.
To explore the effects on the photophysical and electrochemical properties by increasing the π-surface area, we examined UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1b) and cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 2b) of DBP-PhCA, DNP-PhCA and DAP-PhCA. Compared with DBP-PhCA, DNP-PhCA and DAP-PhCA exhibit bathochromic shifts from 67 nm and 144 nm to 525 nm and 602 nm, respectively. The HOMO energy level was increased from −5.83 eV (DBP-PhCA) to −5.64 eV (DNP-PhCA) and −5.31 eV (DAP-PhCA). Interestingly, the introduction of intramolecular charge-transfer properties with the electron-withdrawing 4-(2-cyano-3-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-3-oxoprop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl moiety does not essentially change the fluorescence properties of the diaceno[a,e]pentalene framework. In sharp contrast to DAP-PhCA, DBP-PhCA and DNP-PhCA have no fluorescence properties. Besides, a quite small Stokes shift of 0.16 eV was observed for DAP-PhCA, indicating the rigidity of the π-framework.

Ambient-stable field-effect transistors based on DAP have been fabricated and exhibited excellent hole mobilities (up to 6.55 cm2 V−1 s−1) which is more than 12-fold higher than its dinaphtho[a,e]pentalenes (DNP) analogue (0.52 cm2 V−1 s−1). The absorption onset of DAP-PhCA in thin films was bathochromically shifted to 742 nm by 90 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.67 eV compared with that in solution (Fig. 1d), which can be attributed to the effective π–π interaction in the condensed thin-film state. Combined with its appropriate energy level and wide absorption band, DAPs should be able to serve as a promising molecular platform for organic photovoltaic applications. The BHJ solar cells were fabricated using DAP-PhCA as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor with a conventional device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/DAP-PhCA:PC71BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (60 nm) structure and tested under AM 1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). The fabrication conditions were optimized by varying the blend weight ratio, active layer thicknesses, and processing solvents. Fig. 4a shows that the processing solvent has a significant influence on the photovoltaic performance. At first, we tried chloroform as the processing solvent, which afforded a relatively low PCE of 0.47% with a Voc of 0.92 V, short-circuit current (Jsc) of 1.30 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 39.9%. Under optimized conditions, the active layer was finally spin-coated from the chlorobenzene solution of DAP-PhCA and PC71BM with an optimal weight ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w), and the devices gave a more than four times increase in the PCE to 2.05%, with a Voc of 0.95 V, Jsc of 4.81 mA cm−2, and FF of 44.9%. Furthermore, the PCE of 2.05% is achieved without any extra treatment such as thermal annealing, solvent additives, solvent annealing etc. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal DAP-PhCA-based devices covered a wide wavelength range from 300 to 750 nm (Fig. 4b), which agrees well with its absorption spectrum. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves under the standard solar spectrum (AM 1.5 G) were consistent with the current densities obtained from the J–V measurement with a small deviation of less than 5%. The PCE value is higher than those of dinaphtho[a,e]pentalenes (0.94%), although the conditions were somewhat different.


In summary, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of dianthraceno[a,e]pentalene derivatives using a palladium catalysed cascade reaction, which gave a series of dianthraceno[a,e]pentalenes with good functional group tolerance, and it should be highlighted that five C–C bonds were formed in one reaction. DAP-PhCA shows good absorption features with high fluorescence quantum yield and appropriate frontier energy levels, which is thus suitable for OPVs. A PCE of 2.05% has been obtained with a high Voc value of 0.95 V, which suggests the potential of a diaceno[a,e]pentalene framework for OPV applications.


2,3-Dibromoanthracene was prepared according to the previous literature. Other starting materials were obtained from commercial sources and used as-received without further purification. Anhydrous THF and toluene were dis-tilled over Na/benzophenone prior to use. All the reactions dealing with air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under a nitrogen atmosphere.


The OSC devices were fabricated and characterized in an N2-filled glovebox. Prior to device fabrication, the ITO glasses (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) were cleaned ultrasonically with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. After routine solvent cleaning, the ITO substrates were treated with UV ozone for 20 min and then a PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI 4083) layer (∼40 nm) was spin-coated onto the clean ITO glass and dried at 150 °C for 15 min. The photoactive blend was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS surface from its chlorobenzene solution. The active layer was spin-coated in a N2-filled glovebox from a solution of DAP-PhCA:PC71BM with different weight ratios in chlorobenzene. Finally, a Ca/Al top electrode of 20/60 nm thickness was evaporated. The typical active area of the investigated devices was 3.08 mm2.
