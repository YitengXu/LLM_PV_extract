As a furan-based fused aromatic unit, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) has attracted research interest as a building block owing to its promising photoelectric properties. Its enhanced quinoid character, dense packing, low energy level, and low steric hindrance result in an enhanced photovoltaic efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine previous studies on BDF-based organic photovoltaics. Moreover, we propose strategies for the development of these photovoltaics through a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, and photovoltaic performance of BDF-based photovoltaic materials.

Because of energy shortages and environmental pollution, the subject of carbon-neutral policies has attracted research interest worldwide. As a clean and renewable form of energy, solar energy has great potential to replace fossil fuels, facilitating the realization of carbon-neutral strategies. Si-Based solar cells, which have high efficiency, low cost, and excellent stability, have undergone rapid development and constitute a dominant portion of industrial green energy. In contrast to traditional Si-based solar cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) provide light weight, flexibility, and large-area processability, making them suitable for next-generation green energy technologies. Therefore, OSCs have attracted broad attention in the academic, business, and government sectors. Owing to the development of novel materials and an in-depth understanding of device physics, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was reported to exceed 19% for single-junction OSCs. However, in contrast to inorganic solar cells, OSCs exhibit a low PCE and poor stability, which restrict the commercialization of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Nevertheless, studies have demonstrated that these shortcomings can be reduced by the rational design and molecular structure optimization of organic optoelectronic materials as well as the optimization of device photovoltaic properties. Consequently, high-efficiency OPVs are critical for the development of OSCs.

Thiophene and its derivatives have been widely used as photoelectronic materials and play an important role in the field of OSCs. In particular, various types of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer semiconducting photovoltaic materials based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) have been used to fabricate high-efficiency OSCs. The symmetric and planar conjugated structure of the BDT unit in favor of π–π stacking increases the charge carrier mobility, which can be used to synthesize organic semiconductors with high mobility. Thus far, organic semiconducting materials based on BDT have achieved PCEs of over 18%. However, thiophene and its derivatives, including BDT, originate from petrochemical production, which does not solve the dependence on nonrenewable energy sources. Therefore, environmental concerns have recently prompted researchers to employ organic semiconducting materials based on renewable resources.
Furan is similar to thiophene in structure and can be obtained from renewable sources in large quantities. Trees, vegetables, and food residues can undergo extraction to obtain furfural, from which furan can be obtained through a metal-catalyzed decarbonylation reaction. Additionally, furan and its derivatives can be further changed into ecofriendly materials via metal-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, the use of furan-based materials can help achieve environmental protection via the resource–product–renewable resource feedback process.
As a furan-based fused ring derivative, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) can be produced from renewable sources. BDF exhibits the following properties of furan-based materials in organic semiconductors: (a) oxygen (≈3.5) has a higher electronegativity than sulfur (≈2.5) according to the Pauling electronegativity scale, which can be used to tune the energy levels of materials. (b) The oxygen atom of furan has a smaller covalent radius (1.52 Å) than the sulfur atom of thiophene (1.80 Å); consequently, BDF-based materials easily achieve tight molecular stacking to facilitate charge carrier transport. (c) BDF has adequate rigidity and planarity to maintain good conjugation. (d) Furan-based materials typically exhibit increased solubility, which facilitates the processability of OPV devices. (e) The four and eight positions of BDF can modulate the photovoltaic performance of semiconductor materials by using different substituents.
Inspired by the aforementioned properties of BDF, Huo et al. synthesized a BDF-based polymer that can be applied to OSCs, achieving a PCE of 5%. They found that the BDF-based polymer had a smaller bandgap and better mobility compared to the other representative polymers, like fluorene and BDT, because the weak steric hindrance derived from the oxygen atom of furan improved the molecular planarity. Subsequently, Huo et al. developed a two-dimensional (2D) BDF-based polymer, achieving a higher PCE of 9.43%, which was ascribed to more efficient charge transportation and improved molecular stacking. In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors have been widely investigated, and an extensive library of acceptors has been built for use in OSCs. In particular, with the emergence of the Y6 neo-acceptor system, the extension of the absorption range and the optimization of microtopography can further improve photovoltaic performance. However, batch-to-batch differences in materials limit commercial applications. In 2019, Hu reported that mesopolymers (molar mass [Mn]: 1–10 kDa) provide a natural advantage in reducing batch variation. Nevertheless, a small molecular weight is difficult to crystallize, hindering high efficiency. Recently, Zheng et al. utilized the advantage of stacking for BDF-based materials, synthesizing a mesopolymer and achieving a PCE of over 15%. Thus, BDF-based materials have facilitated a rapid increase in photovoltaic performance from 5% to 16% in 10 years (Fig. 1) and continue to attract increasing research interest.
In this review, to obtain a clear understanding of the development of polymer semiconductor materials based on BDF, we comprehensively summarize the structure–property characteristics, the empirical regularities and perspectives of various BDF-based materials for efficient OPV materials. This review can contribute to the development of ecofriendly and high-performance BDF-based polymer materials in the future.

BDF-based materials have been found to exhibit thermal stability, high luminescence quantum yield, and high charge transport. In 2012, Huo et al. synthesized a solution-processable BDF-based material to fabricate an OSC, which was the first BDF-based photovoltaic material. Further research on BDF-based materials demonstrated that the four and eight positions of the BDF unit can be replaced by different substituent groups. In a previous study, the utilization of the four and eight positions of the BDF unit not only increased the variety of BDF-based materials but also enhanced the tunability of their photoelectrical properties. Importantly, the four and eight positions of the BDF core should contain ketone or halogen functional groups to enable the introduction of side chains (Scheme 1).


Scheme 1 illustrates two strategies for the synthesis of BDF monomers. Huo et al. selected furan-3-carboxylic acid as the starting material, using furan-3-carboxylic acid solution reacting with excess oxalyl chloride to obtain compound 1. Then, dropping compound 1 into a diethylamine solution in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C, they obtained compound 2. Compound 3, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-4, 8-dione, was obtained by dropping n-butyl lithium into the compound 2 solution. Bian et al. used different methods to produce BDF, in which hydroquinone was used as the starting material. Hydroquinone was brominated to obtain compound 4. Subsequently, compound 4 was converted to compound 5via a reaction with 2-bromo-1,1-diethoxyethane. Compound 5 was cyclized to afford 4,8-dibromo-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (compound 6) by polyphosphoric acid as the acid-catalyzed agent. Owing to the presence of ketone or halogen functional groups, different substituents can be introduced into the BDF unit as side chains. Modified BDF groups can be further synthesized to target BDF-based materials through coupled reactions.

BDF is a heterocyclic group with planar geometry and thus good electron delocalization, playing an electron-donating role in semiconducting materials. Furthermore, the BDF group has active positions, which can contribute to increasing the conjugation degree of side chains for the improved charge mobility of organic semiconductors. Because of the presence of furan units, BDF-based polymer semiconductor materials exhibit strong fluorescence, increasing the corresponding device efficiency. Mariusz et al. produced small molecules using the BDF monomer, and the corresponding fluorescence quantum yield varied from 1% to 100% (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the three-membered fused ring of the BDF unit increases its architectural rigidity, improving molecular conjugation. Due to the differences in the electronegativities and covalent radii of oxygen and sulfur atoms, BDF- and BDT-based materials exhibit distinctly different photoelectric properties. Lin et al. investigated the effect of BDF and BDT as electron-donating cores on the photoelectric properties. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, BDF-based materials exhibited redshifted ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra compared with BDT-based materials as the small diameter of the oxygen atom of furan in the BDF monomer facilitates intermolecular stacking. In addition, Lin et al. studied the molecular structure and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels by theoretical calculation. In comparison with BDT-based semiconducting materials, the corresponding BDF materials exhibited better planarity owing to less steric hindrance (Fig. 2c). The oxygen atom with higher electronegativity resulted in a narrower bandgap for BDF-based materials than for BDT-based materials, which can provide more space for adjustable bandgap photovoltaic materials (Fig. 2d). In brief, the intrinsic features of BDF endow it with sufficient properties to develop efficient organic semiconductors.


BDF has favorable electron–donor and charge-transfer characteristics owing to its planar structure and strong electron delocalization. Over the years, BDF has been used to synthesize semiconducting copolymers as an electron-donating block between different π-conjugated monomers. BDF has unique crystallization, optical absorption, and electrochemical properties resulting from the small atomic radius of oxygen atoms in its structure. In this section, we introduce previously reported BDF-based photovoltaic materials.


Benefiting from the presence of unique BDF groups, BDF-based polymers as photovoltaic materials exhibit great potential in the field of OSCs. To obtain a detailed understanding of the characteristics of BDF-based photovoltaic materials, we discuss a series of BDF-based photovoltaic materials with various side chain structures. Based on the side chain structures, we divide these materials into 1D and 2D materials. In this section, we first introduce 1D copolymers (Table 1).

In 2012, Huo et al. reported the application of BDF units in an OSC and synthesized P1 with a narrow bandgap (Fig. 3). The copolymer P1 had a broad absorption range from approximately 300 to 780 nm, a longer effective conjugation length, and moderate HOMO and LUMO levels compared to the BDT analogue. Thereby, achieving a PCE of 5% (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, Decurtins et al. reported a homopolymer and two alternating copolymers for comparison, namely P2 and P3 and P4, respectively. In the polymer backbone, furan played a role in connecting to the side chains, while sp-hybridized carbons directly connected with the main chain. The BDF group acted as an electron-withdrawing group because of the introduction of strong electron-withdrawing nitrile substituents into the furan group in BDF. Among the three polymer-based devices, P2-based devices had the highest PCE owing to the high proportion of the BDF monomer, which contributed to a low HOMO level, thus improving the device PCE. Furthermore, to examine the impact of the molecular configuration on the optoelectronic properties, Hu et al. synthesized two copolymers (P5 and P6) by adopting isoindigo as the acceptor unit and syn-/anti-BDF as the donor unit (Fig. 3). Compared to anti-P6, the onset absorption edge of syn-P5 exhibited blue-shifted absorption (over 30 nm) in thin films, suggesting that it had better conjugation in the polymer skeleton for the anti-structure to achieve better absorption (Fig. 4b). However, the low solubility of anti-P6 led to incompatibility between the polymer and PC71BM, resulting in large-scale phase separation, which deteriorated device performance.
In general, furan has better solubility than thiophene. To further improve the solubility of polymers, Chen et al. used BDF as an electron-donating unit to react with naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione (electron-deficient unit), synthesizing the D–A-type material P7. The good solubility of the BDF unit contributed to the increased solubility of P7 in common organic solvents. In addition, the BDF-based P7 exhibited a low optical bandgap of 1.65 eV and a broad absorption band from 300 to 750 nm. Therefore, the P7:PC71BM-based device exhibited a PCE of 4.71% and a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V (Fig. 4c). Subsequently, Liu et al. synthesized P8 with a narrow bandgap by polymerizing a benzodifuran unit with a thieno-[3,4-b]thiophene derivative. P8 exhibited a broad absorption range (300–840 nm) and good solubility. Moreover, as the planar nature of BDF enhanced the intermolecular π–π stacking of P8, the copolymer exhibited high hole mobility.
To identify the effect of the substituent on molecular energy levels and finely modulate this effect, five low-bandgap BDF-based copolymers (P9–P13) were synthesized by Huo et al. (Fig. 3). Huo et al. tuned the molecular energy levels by introducing different electron-withdrawing groups. In contrast to P12 and P13, the other three polymers exhibited redshifted absorption as the sulphonyl and cyano groups introduced into P12 and P13 led to higher steric hindrance. The highest Voc of 0.87 V was obtained for P13 because of the decrease in the HOMO level with increasing electron-withdrawing capacity. However, owing to the higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of P11, the P11/PC71BM based-photovoltaic device achieved a maximum efficiency of 5.23%. To investigate the effect of alkyl length on the photovoltaic properties, Julien et al. synthesized four BDF-based copolymers (P14–P17). They adopted the electron-withdrawing thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione unit with the introduction of different alkyl chains. The results demonstrate that the deep HOMO level of BDF provided a similar high Voc (Fig. 4d) in all polymer types. Among the four copolymers, based on the P15-based device without any additives, P15 containing n-octyl exhibited a higher PCE of 7.4%. However, when adding 1,8-diiodoctane into the blend solution as an additive, the PCE of the P15-based device decreased by approximately 1%, indicating that BDF-based materials can easily form a suitable nanoscale morphology. Recently, Liu et al. synthesized a novel copolymer, P18, by polymerizing the BDF unit with the dioxazole unit. The P18-based organic solar device exhibited a PCE of 5%. P18 exhibited a high Voc of 0.93 V owing to its deep HOMO level, which was ascribed to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor unit and the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom in the BDF unit.
Usually, π-bridges play a crucial role in adjusting the molecular absorption spectra, energy levels, and crystallinity in the polymer. Therefore, utilizing π-bridges to coordinate optoelectronic properties is a common strategy in the field of organic semiconductors. In 2012, a high-yield method for synthesizing BDF-based polymers (P19 and P20) with different alkyl chains and π-bridges was reported by Brandon et al. (Fig. 5). Different π-bridges had a large impact on the absorption spectra. A redshift of 40 nm was observed for P19 compared to P20. Later, Kobilka et al. introduced different alkyl chains to the 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole unit and added various heteroatoms into the π-bridges, and four BDF-based polymers (P21–P24) were further synthesized. Of these polymers, as P21 and P22 had a furan π-bridge in the polymer backbone, they exhibited good solubility and a neat film morphology, resulting in high efficiency. In contrast, because low solubility caused large phase separation, P23 and P24 exhibited a low PCE.
Furthermore, an effective method was developed for tuning the electron-withdrawing ability of acceptor units by combining acceptor units and the π-bridge, enabling the adjustment of the absorption ranges of polymer donor materials. Three BDF-based copolymers (P25, P26, and P27) with different acceptor units connecting the thiophene π-bridge were reported by Liu et al. As a result of the decrease in the electron-withdrawing capacity of the acceptor units, these polymers exhibited different bandgaps. P27 exhibited blue-shifted absorption (∼60 nm) compared to P25 and P26 in the solid film, which was attributed to the reduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) derived from the relatively weak electron-withdrawing properties of the benzotriazole unit. In contrast, the hole mobility of P25 was superior to that of P26 and P27 because P25 had denser π–π stacking as well as a larger planar structure, resulting in improved charge transport. Consequently, P25 exhibited the highest PCE (4.45%) among the three materials (Fig. 6a). Lei et al. reported a novel BDF-based polymer, P28, using alkyl-substituted benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione as the acceptor unit. The results indicated that the OSC based on P28:IT-M exhibited a favorable Voc under different donor/acceptor ratios, which was attributed to the deep HOMO level of P28 (Fig. 6b).
In OPVs, the fluorination of acceptor units is an effective chemical modification approach. Specifically, to modulate and improve polymer characteristics, including the absorption range, molecular energy level, and intermolecular/intramolecular interactions, fluorinated acceptor units have been introduced. Xiao et al. reported a BDF-based polymer donor, P29, based on monofluorinated benzothiazole as the acceptor unit.P29 exhibited a low bandgap and improved electron-withdrawing ability resulting from the fluorinated acceptor unit, leading to enhanced ICT. As the molecular stacking and crystallinity were enhanced by F–S interactions between the thiophene unit and fluorinated benzothiazole unit, P29 exhibited superior hole mobility (1.83 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). Yu et al. synthesized an analogue, P30, that differed from P29 in that it contained difluorinated benzothiadiazole. As a result, P30 exhibited an apparent redshift and a deeper HOMO level compared to P29, and Voc of the P30-based device was higher (0.76 V).

The utilization of 2D conjugated groups as side chains in electron-donating units is an efficient method to obtain high-efficiency OSCs. An increase in conjugation can further modulate absorption, energy levels, intermolecular interactions, and molecular crystallinity for 2D-conjugated polymers based on BDF. For instance, in 2012, Biewer et al. synthesized P31 and P32 using phenylethynyl-substituted BDF units; the former is a homopolymer, while the latter is an alternating copolymer (Fig. 7). Owing to the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom, P31 with a high BDF rate demonstrated a deeper HOMO level than P32. Consequently, the device based on P31 exhibited a higher Voc than that of the device based on P32. Liu et al. reported a copolymer (P33) incorporating thiophene into the BDF unit as a side chain, achieving good planarity by introducing the 2D side chain in BDF-based polymers. Thus, P33 exhibited excellent hole mobility (5.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) because of the improved charge transfer resulting from increased molecular stacking. Subsequently, Gao et al. reported a 2D medium-bandgap copolymer, P34, by polymerizing BDF (donor unit) with furo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (acceptor unit). According to the 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement (Fig. 6c), P34 exhibited a favorable orientation that was conducive to charge transport and collection. Consequently, the corresponding device exhibited a superior PCE of 9.58% and high FF of 70.1% (Table 2).

Considering that good planarity tends to generate limited microphase interfaces and large phase separation in the blend, Qiao et al. afforded a copolymer, P35, by incorporating a benzene ring substituent in the BDF unit. Owing to the increase in steric hindrance caused by the extension of aryl side chains, the molecular self-aggregation tendency was inhibited. Therefore, appropriate phase separation and good miscibility were achieved, leading to an improved morphology and PCE for P35-based devices.
Moreover, given that BDF possesses favorable properties relative to BDT, Huo et al. comprehensively evaluated the properties of BDF-based copolymers by comparing BDT and a 2D BDF-based copolymer, P36. Compared to the sulfur atom of BDT, because the oxygen atom had a smaller size and stronger electronegativity, P36 exhibited a deeper HOMO level and stronger intermolecular interactions compared to its BDT counterpart. It was found that P36 had a higher Voc and FF, which explained its higher PCE than that of the copolymer based on BDT.
Considering the strengths of the furan unit, namely, the small π-stacking distance, good planarity, and high conjugation, Du et al. synthesized a copolymer, P37, based on the alkyl-furan-substituted BDF unit. The dihedral angle of P37 of less than 0.1° revealed a planar conjugated backbone with negligible torsion (Fig. 6d), which was favorable for high crystallization and face-on orientation. Thus, OSCs based on P37 exhibited a high FF exceeding 70%.
Murali et al. reported a new copolymer, P38, by changing alkyl-furan to alkyl-thiophene, promoting the ICT of the polymer backbone, and the energy level of P38 was subtly modulated. To improve the photovoltaic performance, they used P38 as a sensitizer in OSCs based on P3HT:PCBM. The performance of the ternary device (∼3.10%) was significantly higher than that of the binary counterpart (∼2.15%) because of the existence of a strong energy level and the occurrence of complementary absorption between P38 and P3HT:PCBM.
To clarify the influence of BDF side chains with different dimensionality on optoelectronic performance, Tang et al. synthesized a range of copolymers (P39–P47) by changing the acceptor unit by introducing different side chains (Fig. 8). The results revealed that P39, P40, P43, and P44 exhibited superior energy levels and distinct redshift absorption in comparison with other analogs, which was ascribed to the increase in the degree of molecular conjugation. Furthermore, to study the effects of side chains on photovoltaic performance, Wang et al. synthesized three conjugated copolymers (P48–P50) based on BDF with different alkyl side chains. As a result, P49 with two meta-dioctyl-thienyl side chains exhibited an optimized interpenetrating network, leading to a maximum PCE of 6.73%. Huo et al. reported P51 and P52 achieved by alkyoxy- or alkyl-thiophene-substituted BDF as donor units to investigate the effects of conjugated and nonconjugated substitution on photovoltaic performance (Fig. 10). The superior performance of the P52-based device than that of P51-based device can be attributed to the extended conjugated area of the 2D side chains, which improved intermolecular π–π interactions, resulting in enhanced charge transfer.
Moreover, the change of the heteroatom on the conjugated side chains was investigated as an efficient strategy for tuning photovoltaic performance. For instance, Zhang et al. obtained two BDF-based copolymers (P53 and P54) using thiophene and furan as 2D side chains.P53 exhibited a higher hole mobility than P54, with a higher PCE (4.42%) than the latter. Owing to the good planarity and high degree of conjugation of furan, Huang et al. reported P55 and P56 using thiophene and furan as side chains in the BDF unit, respectively. They observed that furan as a side chain can increase the planarity of the molecular structure, which can considerably promote molecular stacking (Fig. 9a), further extending the absorption range. The results demonstrated that the P56-based device achieved a higher PCE (5.23%) than P55.
With the advent of non-fullerene OSCs, the reduction of the energy loss (Eloss) of a device is important to promote photovoltaic properties. Thus, to investigate how side chains influence energy loss, Zhang et al. synthesized two BDF-based copolymers (P57 and P58) with alkyl-furan and alkyl-thiophene side chains. The HOMO and LUMO of P57 decreased owing to the strong electronegativity of the oxygen atom in the alkylfuryl side chain (Fig. 9b), thus achieving a Voc superior to that of P58. Subsequently, Zhang et al. obtained two new copolymers (P59 and P60) by changing thiophene in P57 and P58 into a furan π-bridge, respectively (Fig. 8). Consequently, P60 exhibited better miscibility and denser intermolecular packing than P59 in the blend films as the BDF unit with alkylfuryl side chains displayed good planarity. Therefore, a superior PCE of 8.79% was achieved for P60-based OSCs compared to that for P59-based OSCs.
Considering that the fluorinated acceptor units of 1D BDF-based polymers can promote photovoltaic properties, using halogens to modify 2D polymers should play an important role in improving photoelectronic performance. Bin et al. used fluorinated benzothiazole as the acceptor unit to synthesize a 2D BDF-based copolymer, P61 (Fig. 10). Because of the complementary absorption between P61 and the acceptor in the visible–near-infrared region as well as the lower HOMO energy level, P61-based OSCs displayed a high PCE of 11.05% with a high Voc of 0.96 V. To study the impact of the number of fluorine substituents in acceptor units on the photovoltaic properties of the device, Cong et al. synthesized P62 and P63 containing mono-/difluorine-substituted acceptor units. A higher PCE (4.44%) was achieved for P63 than for P62 owing to the lower HOMO level of P63 and superior hole mobility resulting from enhanced crystallinity.
The effects of low steric hindrance are twofold: first, the smaller (oxygen) atom improves molecular planarity, facilitating intermolecular packing and charge transfer. Second, exceedingly tight stacking can cause difficulty in charge extraction in OSCs. Therefore, Sun et al. synthesized a BDF-based polymer, P64, using naphthalene with a large steric hindrance as a side chain to optimize molecular stacking.P64 achieved a remarkable PCE of >16% because introducing the naphthalene side chain achieved better miscibility and appropriate phase separation, resulting in optimized morphology and enhanced PCE.
To enhance molecular stacking, Gao et al. synthesized two copolymers, P65 and P66, using the molecular locking effect of fluorine to improve molecular planarity. The dihedral angle between the thiophene layer and the benzotriazole unit in P66 was smaller than that in P65 according to the results of density functional theory calculations, which was due to the molecular locking effect in P66 induced by F–H and F–S bonds. The 2D GIWAXS results indicated that P66 exhibited tighter π–π packing than P65, thereby achieving increased intermolecular charge transfer and higher PCE (Fig. 9c).
Subsequently, to further investigate the effect of the chlorinated thiophene π-bridge in the BDF-based polymer on photovoltaic performance, Ye et al. synthesized two BDF copolymers (P67 and P68) (Fig. 10), where the latter used chlorinated thiophene as the π-bridge to connect the electron-deficient unit and BDF. Thus, P68-based devices exhibited a higher PCE and Voc (13.10% and 0.83 V, respectively) than their P67-based counterparts owing to the deeper HOMO level of P68.
Except for various halogenated modifications of the electron-withdrawing unit, recent studies have reported that fluorine and chlorine as substituents in side chains significantly modulate the energy levels, crystallinity, and other properties. According to the above regularities, Li et al. synthesized P69, which was composed of fluorinated benzotriazole as the acceptor unit and BDF substituted with chlorinated alkylthiophene as the donor unit. The HOMO level of P69 was further decreased, and the molecular stacking degree and crystallinity were increased by the halogen-group-modified side chains. Thus, an excellent PCE of 14% in P69-based devices was achieved because of the fibril mesh morphology with beneficial phase separation (Fig. 12a). Additionally, the corresponding devices manifested outstanding environmental stability, thereby facilitating commercial applications. For a more in-depth study of the impact of chlorine and fluorine substitutions in the side chains on photovoltaic properties, He et al. synthesized two copolymers, P69 and P70, the former with chlorine-substituted side chains and the latter with fluorine-substituted side chains (Fig. 10). The lower HOMO and improved intermolecular packing resulted in a higher PCE of 11.37% for P69-based devices.
Subsequently, to achieve a low energy loss (Eloss) in the field of OSCs, a copolymer, P71, which comprised fluorinated benzotriazole as the acceptor unit and (2-ethylhexyl)(2-fluorophenyl)sulfane-substituted BDF as the donor unit, was synthesized. The polymer possessed a large coplanar structure and a deep HOMO level. The higher PCE of 12.93% with a superior Voc of 1.02 V and smaller Eloss of 0.57 eV was obtained in OSCs. Given that the fluorine-substituted side chains had a large effect on the energy loss, He et al. synthesized a conjugated copolymer, P72, where the alkyldifluorophenyl side chain was introduced into the BDF unit. The increase in the number of fluorine atoms further reduced the HOMO value of P72; consequently, a smaller Eloss of 0.525 eV was achieved for the P72-based device.
The studies described above indicate a scalable strategy of molecular design for achieving efficient OSCs with a low energy loss. To further adjust the molecular stacking and aggregation, He et al. produced a new BDF copolymer, P73, in which ester-substituted thiophene was introduced into the backbone on the basis of P72.P73 exhibited weak blue-shifted absorption (Fig. 9d) and a deeper HOMO as well as improved intermolecular stacking in comparison with P72. Without any solvent additive or thermal/solvent annealing, OSCs based on P73 exhibited an effective PCE of 12.2%, a high Voc of 0.904 V, and an excellent FF of 76.6% (Table 2). Recently, Zheng et al. used the advantage of easy stacking for the BDF unit, synthesizing a novel BDF-based mesopolymer, P74 (Fig. 10).P74-based devices achieved a relatively high PCE of 15.06% attributable to their moderate miscibility and appropriate phase separation in the blend film (Fig. 12b). Importantly, the mesopolymer P74 exhibited smaller batch-to-batch variation than conventional polymers.

Inspired by the successful application of indacenodithiophene-type acceptors, the advent of Y-series non-fullerene acceptors can further promote the development of OSCs. Importantly, Y-series acceptors not only improve device efficiency but also increase the requirement for the crystallinity of polymer donors. Generally, polymers with a high molecular weight have better crystallinity, which significantly improves the charge mobility. Consequently, Yan et al. synthesized a BDF-based polymer (P75) with high crystallinity and adopted Y6-1O with high crystallinity as the acceptor to fabricate devices (Fig. 11). Through the regulation of crystallization, P75 achieved the highest PCE obtained herein, 16.38%, with a high FF of 77.3%, which is ascribed to the BDF-based P75 possessing matched energy levels, complementary absorption spectra, and an excellent fibril network with Y6-1O (Fig. 10). Moreover, Yan et al. found that adding a small amount of PC71BM into a binary device based on P75:Y6-1O led to an impressive PCE of 17.07%. The above results indicate that BDF-based materials can significantly regulate the crystallinity of materials by changing the molecular structure, thereby improving device performance.

According to previous studies, the excellent characteristics of BDF contribute to the development of promising OPV materials. Thus, BDF-based small-molecule semiconducting materials have also been synthesized apart from BDF-based polymers (Fig. 13) (Table 3). For instance, Du et al. designed a small molecule, S1, based on a 2D BDF unit using octyl cyanoacetate as the end-capped block. Owing to the excellent stacking of the BDF unit, S1 exhibited strong self-aggregation, resulting in a high order in the solid state. Consequently, the S1-based device exhibited a moderate PCE of 4.49% with a Voc of 0.90 V and an FF of 67.97% (Table 3). To investigate the correlation between the molecular structure and aggregation in small-molecule-based solar cells, Qian et al. synthesized two small molecules using BDT and BDF as electron-donating units.S2 exhibited tight π–π packing and appropriate aggregation because of the small oxygen atom and dominant solubility of the BDF unit. Consequently, the S2-based device possessed a higher double photocurrent than the BDT-based device, thereby achieving a higher PCE of 5.5%. In addition, Alexandre et al. synthesized two conjugated small molecules, S3 and S4, based on BDF using simple synthetic routes. Because the efficiency of the corresponding OPVs was low, the fluorescence quantum yield was enhanced by the introduction of the BDF unit and the expansion of the conjugated system. The aforementioned studies demonstrated that BDF-based small molecules are promising alternatives to OPV materials.

In 2020, Liu et al. synthesized a novel BDF-based small molecule with a low bandgap, S5. The charge mobility of the S5-based device reached 7.7 × 10−2 cm V−1 s−1 by optimizing the heating conditions of the device, indicating that the photovoltaic properties of the BDF-based small molecule can be further improved by optimizing the device. BDF is used not only in small-molecule donors but also in acceptor materials. For example, Ma et al. produced two novel small-molecule acceptors based on BDT and BDF (S6) with ladder-type heteroheptacenes, respectively.S6 exhibited a higher HOMO level and lower bandgap than those of the BDT-based acceptor. However, the S6:M8-based device exhibited a low PCE of 4.21% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 8.36 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60.59% (Table 3). Optimizing the molecular backbone is one of the most effective strategies to improve the photovoltaic properties of A–D–A small-molecule acceptor material. Using this strategy, Li et al. adopted a new donor unit with heptacyclic benzodi(thienocyclopentafuran) to synthesize two small-molecule acceptor materials (S7 and S8), the donor unit containing a BDF core and conjugated alkyl-thiophene side chains.S8 exhibited orderly intermolecular π–π stacking, stronger crystallinity, and improved photovoltaic performance compared to S7. Thus, S8-based OSCs exhibited an excellent PCE of 13.4%, which was higher than that of S7 (8.7%).
As an electron-donating group, BDF is a potential building module for synthesizing organic semiconducting materials for OSCs. Based on the above discussion, several important conclusions can be drawn. First, BDF polymers and small molecules have greater potential than BDT-based materials for optimizing miscibility and crystallinity owing to their superior solubility. In addition, tuning the crystallinity and energy levels of materials based on BDF can be achieved by applying halogenation and 2D-substituted groups. Therefore, a PCE of 16% was obtained for high-efficiency D–A-type copolymers based on BDF by using these strategies. Furthermore, the photovoltaic properties of BDF-based OSCs can be further enhanced because BDF-based materials can achieve low energy loss. However, further studies based on BDF-based materials must be conducted to clarify, for instance, the influence of syn-BDF and anti-BDF units on optical–electronic performance.

In this paper, we systematically described research advances for more than 70 compounds based on BDF and revealed the effects of their structural modifications on physicochemical and photovoltaic performance. As a fused aromatic unit containing furan, BDF has unique characteristics, such as an enhanced quinoid character, dense packing, low energy level, and low steric hindrance. The examined studies indicate that BDF is a promising electron-donating building block and that OSCs based on BDF can achieve a high PCE.

However, some problems have been encountered in the development of BDF-based materials for OSCs, such as high energy loss, high cost, and uncontrollable batch-to-batch variation. To produce highly efficient BDF-based materials, we propose several methods for the design and synthesis of the molecular structure.
(1) For high energy loss, halogen modification can be employed to reduce the HOMO level of materials.
(2) The synthesis of BDF-based materials can be simplified to achieve low cost.
(3) The application of mesopolymers is a promising approach to maintain batch-to-batch consistency in OSCs.
In conclusion, BDF-based materials are promising photovoltaic materials for developing OSCs. Although the efficiency of BDF-based materials surpassed 16%, their PCE was lower than that of BDT-based materials. To improve the photovoltaic performance of BDF-based materials, synthesizing wide-absorption and deep-HOMO-level BDF-based polymer donors is necessary to achieve a high Jsc and maximal Voc. Moreover, polymers should maintain an appropriate LUMO energy level to achieve effective charge separation and transfer. In addition, the molecular weight can be optimized to regulate the molecular packing and nanoscale morphology and subsequently achieve high charge mobility. In addition, matched acceptors should be developed to reduce the energy loss and optimize the microtopography of blend films. For the stability and commercialization of OSCs, all-polymer solar cells based on BDF-based polymer donors and matched polymer acceptors are highly promising. With the development of novel materials, we anticipate that more ecofriendly and high-efficiency BDF-based materials can be produced in the future.
