Two new donor–acceptor copolymers containing carbazole and thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline units with meta- and para-positioned alkoxy groups on the peripheral phenyl rings, PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p, were designed and synthesized. Their thermal stability, UV-Vis absorptions, energy levels and photovoltaic properties were investigated. Compared with their quinoxaline analogues using carbazole and quinoxaline derivatives as donor and acceptor units, by simply fusing a thiophene ring to the quinoxaline unit, PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p not only exhibit lower bandgaps (∼1.8 eV) but also maintain deep HOMO energy levels (∼−5.3 eV). A polymer solar cell based on PCTTQx-m with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al showed a promising PCE of 4.40% with a rather high open circuit voltage of 0.89 V, a short circuit current of 9.03 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.54, which was higher than that of PCTTQx-p (3.45%). After solvent vapor annealing treatment, the PCE of the polymer solar cell based on a PCTTQx-m/PC71BM blend film could be further improved to 5.31%.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to due to their low cost, light weight and capacity for roll-to-roll technology. Most polymer solar cell systems are based on a bulk heterojunction structure in the active layer, prepared from blends of electron-rich polymers and electron deficient fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). To achieve highly efficient PSCs, photovoltaic polymers should have a low optical bandgap for efficient sunlight harvesting and thus, a large short circuit current (Jsc). Until now, a general method for low bandgap polymers is to design alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers through a combination of suitable electron donor units and electron acceptor units, which can readily tune the absorption and frontier orbital energy levels of the copolymers.

Since open circuit voltage (Voc) is related to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBMs, a D–A copolymer with a deep HOMO level will lead to a high open circuit voltage. Among various donor units, the cheap carbazole unit has been proven as an excellent electron-donating building block for D–A copolymers with a high Voc, due to its good thermal and chemical stability, high charge carrier mobility and in particular, relatively low HOMO energy level. Recently, photovoltaic devices based on alternating copolymers derived from thieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) and carbazole have even shown a high Voc of 1.07 V.
Quinoxaline derivatives have been widely used as an acceptor unit for D–A copolymers because of the electron-withdrawing property of the imine nitrogen atoms. For example, the first D–A copolymer based on quinoxaline and carbazole exhibited a PEC of 1.8% with a high Voc of 0.95 V. By introducing two alkoxybenzene groups on the quinoxaline rings, the quinoxaline-based copolymers containing carbazole (EWC3) showed an improved PCE of 3.7% and a Voc of 0.9 V. However, most of them have large bandgaps (>1.9 eV), which may limit their short circuit currents. Recently, dibenzo[a,c]phenazine and dithienophenazine have been used as quinoxaline-based acceptor units with large fused planar aromatic rings to construct carbazole-based D–A copolymers with a much lower bandgap and larger Jsc. However, the Voc of these copolymers decreased to 0.8 V or even lower at the same time, which resulted in very limited enhancement of their PCEs (3.0–3.8%).
Herein, two new quinoxaline-based D–A copolymers, poly[N-9-heptadecanyl-2,7-cabazole-alt-5,5-(5,8-di-2-thinenyl-2-(3-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline)] (PCTTQx-m) and poly[N-9-heptadecanyl-2,7-cabazole-alt-5,5-(5,8-di-2-thinenyl-2-(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)thieno[3,2-b] quinoxaline)] (PCTTQx-p), were synthesized via a Suzuki coupling reaction (Fig. 1). Thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline (TQx) as a new acceptor unit was developed by simply fusing a thiophene ring to the quinoxaline. We expect the introduction of TQx into the D–A copolymers will not only decrease their bandgaps, like the above-mentioned phenazine derivatives, but also maintain a relatively high Voc. Compared to the alkoxyphenyl-substituent quinoxaline-based analogue (model compound of EWC3), density functional theory (DFT) studies of these model compounds show lower bandgaps and similar HOMO energy levels (ESI). The alkoxyphenyl chain was linked to the 2-position of the thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline unit, which will ensure the solubility of the copolymers. Moreover, the photovoltaic properties of PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p with the same polymer backbone but different alkoxy side chain positions on the phenyl group were investigated. Similar to the alkoxybenzene-substituent quinoxaline-based D–A copolymers reported by Hou et al., the copolymer with the meta-positioned alkoxy group (PCTTQx-m) showed a higher Voc of 0.89 V and therefore a higher PCE of 4.40%. In addition, the PCE of the polymer solar cells based on a PCTTQx-m/PC71BM blend film could be further improved to 5.31% after a solvent vapor annealing treatment.


Fig. 1 reveals the chemical structure and synthetic progress for both the monomer and the polymers. 5,8-Dibromo-2-alkoxyphenyl-thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline (4m, 4p) was synthesized with a modified procedure similar to 2-phenyl-thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline. The treatment of dibromoquinoxalin-2-one (1) with acetophenones in the presence of boron trifluoride gives the intermediate 3m or 3p, which can be transformed into 4m or 4pvia a reaction with P2S5. The coupling reaction of the dibromide 4m and 4p with tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane yielded 2-(3-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline (5m) and 2-(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline (5p), respectively. Bromination of 5m and 5p with NBS in THF afforded two monomers, M-m and M-p. D–A type copolymers were synthesized by Suzuki polymerization of M-m and M-p with monomer 7, respectively. The Mn of the copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using polystyrene as a standard. The Mn of PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p are 33.1 and 25.2 kg mol−1. The thermal stability of the copolymers was investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p exhibited good thermal stability (Fig. S2, ESI) with a 5% weight loss at temperatures of 420 °C and 368 °C, which were adequate for the application of the copolymers as active materials in polymer solar cells.


UV-vis absorption spectra of PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p were measured in a chlorobenzene (CB) solution and as thin films (Fig. 2) at room temperature (25 °C) and the results are summarized in Table 1. Both the polymers show two absorption peaks in solution and as a film, which is a common feature of D–A copolymers. The absorption peaks at short wavelengths originate from π–π* transitions of the conjugated backbone, while the absorption peaks at longer wavelengths could be attributed to a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the carbazole donor and the thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline acceptor. The absorption of PCTTQx-m exhibits a red shifted (11 nm) absorption peak compared to PCTTQx-p in both the solution and film states. It is worth noting that there is no obvious red shift for their absorption peaks as a film compared with those in solution at room temperature. For most quinoxaline-based photovoltaic polymers, there is a clear red shift for their absorption spectra going from solution to a solid film because of the aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state. Considering the more extended π-conjugation of thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline compared to quinoxaline, the unusual absence of the red shift for PCTTQx may originate from the formation of aggregates in the CB solution at room temperature, which could be further confirmed by their absorption spectra in a CB solution at 80 °C. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, at 80 °C both polymers show absorption peaks around 537 nm with an obvious blue shift compared to those measured at room temperature. This blue shift can be attributed to the breakup of interchain aggregates in solution at higher temperatures. The aggregate formed in solution at room temperature may be induced by enhanced π–π interactions between the polymer chains containing larger aromatic planar rings. The optical bandgaps of PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p deduced from the onset of the absorption spectra as films are 1.80 eV and 1.81 eV, respectively, which are lower than those (>1.9 eV) of most quinoxaline-based analogues. The lower bandgaps of thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline-based polymers will benefit their photovoltaic performances.

The electrochemical behaviors of the copolymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 3, both polymers present one irreversible p-doping process. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were obtained from the equation  and ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg respectively. As shown in Table 2, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PCTTQx-m are calculated to be −5.31 eV and −3.51 eV, respectively. PCTTQx-p shows similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.27 eV and −3.46 eV. As reported in the previous literature, the contribution to the resonance electron-donating effect of the alkoxy group at the para-position of the phenyl group is stronger than that of the alkoxy group at the meta-position, which results in the slightly higher HOMO energy level of PCTTQx-p. Nevertheless, they still exhibit low-lying HOMO energy levels as expected, suggesting a rather high Voc for their photovoltaic devices. The relatively large offsets between the LUMO levels of both the copolymers and PC71BM promises efficient photo-induced electron transfer from the copolymers to PC71BM.

Bulk heterojunction PSCs were fabricated by spin-coating the blend from the dichlorobenzene solutions at optimized polymer:PC71BM (1:4) ratios using a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al configuration with an active layer of approximately 90 nm. The device performance was measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination. The current density–voltage characteristics of both the polymers are shown in Fig. 4 and the results are summarized in Table 2. The device based on the PCTTQx-m/PC71BM blend exhibits a rather high Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 9.03 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.54 and a PCE of 4.40%. In particular, the Voc value is comparable to those of quinoxaline-based analogues. The device based on the PCTTQx-p/PC71BM blend exhibits a lower PCE of 3.45% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 8.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.47. In fact, this worse device performance for the copolymer with the para-positioned alkoxy group has also been observed in other quinoxaline-based polymers, which can be explained by the electron donating effect of the alkoxy group. Nevertheless, the PCE of the PCTTQx-m/PC71BM blend is already among the highest value for D–A copolymers containing carbazole and quinoxaline derivatives.

The morphologies of the copolymer/PC71BM blends were further studied by TEM. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, the morphologies of both the origin copolymer/PC71BM blends are rather uniform and featureless, perhaps leading to their rather low FFs. For bulk heterojunction PSCs, nanoscale phase separation and the existence of percolating pathways leading to the electrodes are needed to obtain an optimal performance. A solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment has been proven to be effective in the segregation of copolymers and PCBMs inside the active layers of many polymer solar cells. Here, we conducted THF vapor annealing on these homogeneous blend films to achieve optimized morphologies and improved PCEs. As shown in the TEM images (Fig. 5b and d), the nanoscale phase separation between the copolymers and PC71BM can be clearly observed after SVA treatment for 60 s under THF vapor, which will reduce the recombination of holes and electrons and improve the FF. The corresponding current density–voltage characteristics after the THF vapor annealing are shown in Fig. 6a and Table 2. The fill factors of both devices are improved. The PCTTQx-m/PC71BM blend exhibits a clearly enhanced FF of 0.65 and the PCE was improved from 4.40% to 5.31% at the same time. Similarly, the PCTTQx-p/PC71BM blend exhibits an improved PCE of 4.43% with a FF of 0.57. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized devices based on polymer/PC71BM illuminated by monochromatic light was determined and shown in Fig. 6b. Both the devices show a very efficient photoresponse in a broad range from 350 to 700 nm. The EQE exceeds 40% in the spectral region from 350 to 600 nm. The integral of the EQE is in accordance with the Jsc values measured from the devices.

In summary, we designed and synthesized new copolymers (PCTTQx-m and PCTTQx-p) using carbazole and thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline as a donor and a acceptor, with different alkoxy side chain positions on the alkoxyphenyl substituents. The absorption spectra, electronic energy levels and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were characterized. Although both of them exhibit similar low bandgaps (∼1.8 eV) and low-lying HOMO energy levels (∼−5.3 eV), the photovoltaic performance of PCTTQx-m is better than that of PCTTQx-p. Under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, the power conversion efficiency of the polymer solar cell based on PCTTQx-m/PC71BM (1:4, by weight) reached 4.40% and was further improved to 5.31% after THF vapor annealing, which is among the highest values for D–A copolymers containing carbazole and quinoxaline derivatives as donor and acceptor units. These results demonstrate that thieno[3,2-b]quinoxaline, obtained by simply fusing a thiophene ring to the quinoxaline unit, is a promising electron-deficient building block for developing D–A type alternating copolymers for high performance solar cells.

2,7-Bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9′′-heptadecanyl-carbazole (0.1973 g, 0.3 mmol), M-m (0.2138 g, 0.3 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (2 mg) and Aliquat 336 (0.1 g, 0.25 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of chlorobenzene (15 ml) and a 2 M K2CO3 solution in water (2 ml) under argon. The mixture was refluxed with vigorous stirring in the dark for 24 h under an argon atmosphere. After reaction completion, phenylboronic acid (12 mg, 0.10 mmol) was added to the reaction and then six hours later, bromobenzene (11 μl, 0.10 mmol) was added and the mixture was refluxed overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol. The obtained solid was dissolved in chlorobenzene. The solution was washed with water and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 for 30 min. After most of the solvent was removed, the residue was poured into stirred methanol. The precipitated material was collected by filtration through a funnel. After washing with acetone and hexane for 24 h in a Soxhlet apparatus, the resulting material was dried in a vacuum to yield 244 mg (85%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, ODCB-d4) δ 8.29 (m, 7H), 8.05 (br, 1H), 7.95 (br, 2H), 7.80 (br, 2H), 7.73–7.50 (m, 3H), 7.19 (br, J = 12.6 Hz, 2H), 5.10 (br, 1H), 4.20 (br, 2H), 2.78 (br, 2H), 2.41 (br, 2H), 2.01 (br, 1H), 1.89–1.27 (m, 32H), 1.18 (m, 6H), 0.99 (br, 6H). Mw, 112.5 kg mol−1; Mw/Mn, 3.4.


PCTTQx-p was prepared according to the same procedure as that for PCTTQx-m. Yield: 232 mg (81%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, ODCB-d4) δ 8.29 (m, 7H), 7.93 (br, 6H), 7.81 (br, 2H), 7.22 (br, 2H), 5.09 (br, 1H), 4.14 (br, 2H), 2.78 (br, 2H), 2.42 (br, 2H), 1.97 (br, 1H), 1.79–1.26 (m, 32H), 1.15 (m, 6H), 0.99 (br, 6H). Mw, 93.2 kg mol−1; Mw/Mn, 3.7.


1H and 13C NMR were record using a Bruker-400 spectrometer operating at 400 or 101 MHz in a deuterated chloroform solution or ODCB at 298 K or 393 K. Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard. Elemental analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad elemental analysis system. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were performed on an AXIMA CFR MS apparatus (COMPACT). The molecular weights (MWs) and molecular weight distributions of the polymer samples were determined at 150 °C by a PL-GPC 220 type high-temperature gel permeation chromatography. 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (TCB) was employed as the solvent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1 and the calibration was made with a polystyrene standard Easi-Cal PS-1 (PL Ltd). The thermal properties of the polymers were analyzed with a Perkin-Elmer-TGA 7 instrument under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrometer. CV experiments were performed on an EG&G 283 (Princeton Applied Research) potentiostat/galvanostat system with a platinum working electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode with a nitrogen-saturated anhydrous solution of 0.1 mol l−1n-Bu4NClO4 in acetonitrile. TEM was performed on a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV.


The solar cell was fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. A mixture of copolymer and PC71BM were dissolved in dichlorobenzene and stirred overnight for complete dissolution. A 40 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P AI 4083) layer was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrate and dried at 120 °C for 30 min in an oven. The ca. 90 nm thick copolymer:PC71BM active layer was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS layer via spin-coating from a 4 mg ml−1 copolymer/PC71BM solution at 80 °C. Finally, a bilayer structure of LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm) was thermally deposited atop the active layer in a vacuum chamber under a base pressure of about 4 × 10−4 Pa. The cell active area was 12 mm2, which was defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al electrodes.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic was measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter. An oriel 150 W solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter was used to provide an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 for the illumination of the photovoltaic cells. The light intensity was determined by a calibrated silicon diode with a KG-5 filter. The EQE measurement was performed under short-circuit conditions with a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research System) at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz during illumination with a monochromatic light from a Xenon lamp.
