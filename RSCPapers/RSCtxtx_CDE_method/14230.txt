Hollow Co9S8 nanoneedle arrays directly grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conducting substrates were successfully prepared using a simple sacrificial template method. The performances of CdS/CdSe quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) employing such Co9S8 counter electrodes were remarkably improved compared to those using conventional Pt counter electrodes, primarily due to their higher electrocatalytic activity in the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes.

One-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials (e.g., nanorods, nanowires) with large surface areas, direct electrical pathways and possible quantum effects show excellent application prospects in nanoscale electronic, photonic, and electrochemical devices. For example, 1D nanoarray materials (e.g., TiO2 nanorod/nanotube arrays and ZnO nanorod arrays) have been widely applied to photoelectrochemical devices. On the other hand, metal sulphides (e.g., cobalt sulphides, nickel sulphides, and lead sulphides) are promising electrocatalytic materials and have been extensively utilized in many fields in recent years. Especially, since dye-/quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (DSCs/QDSCs) have attracted tremendous attention from researchers, metal sulphides as the counter electrode materials in these DSC/QDSC devices have come under large investigation. It is well-known that Pt is expensive and a poor electrocatalyst for the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes used in QDSCs, which strongly holds back its application in DSCs/QDSCs. In this regard, many studies have been conducted on the exploitation of alternative electrocatalyst materials as effective counter electrodes in DSCs/QDSCs, and metal sulphides have been verified as promising counter electrode materials for DSCs and QDSCs. Generally, many metal sulphide counter electrodes have been prepared by doctor blading on conducting substrates which resulted in poor binding forces between the materials and substrates, and thus weakened the stability of the counter electrodes. Significantly, 1D metal sulphide nanoarray materials directly grown on conductive substrates would avoid this problem, and then perform as one of the best candidates for counter electrodes to boost performance of the resulting DSCs and QDSCs. However, to date, ordered metal sulphide nanostructures haven't been studied sufficiently and it is still a great challenge to grow 1D metal sulphide nanoarrays on conductive substrates.

Herein, we report a new method to directly grow Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle array films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conductive substrates. Such Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle array films exhibited large surface areas and strong binding forces with the FTO substrates. Moreover, they showed higher electrocatalytic ability in the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes, and consequently improved the performance of the QDSCs organized using these Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle array-based counter electrodes as compared to those using the traditional Pt counter electrode. Furthermore, annealing these Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle array films could further enhance the power conversion efficiency of QDSCs.
The strategy for preparing Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle arrays is shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, two steps were included in this template-assisted method: (1) grow the one-dimensional template material (Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O) on a FTO substrate by chemical bath deposition in a mixed solution of urea and cobalt chloride; (2) convert the template material into the target material (Co9S8) using hydrothermal treatment in a sodium sulphide solution. Fig. 2E shows the prepared Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O template. Nanoneedles were grown uniformly on the FTO substrate, with a diameter of around 200 nm and length of several micrometers (Fig. 2E), which were solid and single crystals as proven by the SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 2A) and HRTEM image (Fig. 2B). After being hydrothermally treated in a 10 mM Na2S aqueous solution at 180 °C for 10 h, the solid nanoneedle templates were converted into hollow nanoneedles, which was confirmed by the TEM image (Fig. 2C). The corresponding cross-sectional view indicated that such nanoneedles were hexagonal (inset in Fig. 2C) and that their phase was Co9S8 which was confirmed by the XRD pattern (Fig. 3A, JCPDS no. 03-065-3322, Pa, a = b = c = 0.5535 nm). The surface of the nanoneedles became rough but the needle-like structure changed little after the hydrothermal conversion (Fig. 2F).
XRD patterns (Fig. 3A) showed that with an increase of the hydrothermal reaction time, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O template decreased and then almost disappeared when the reaction time was prolonged to 7 h, suggesting that the Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O templates were completely consumed after 7 h. The conversion from solid Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanoneedle templates to hollow Co9S8 nanoneedles by hydrothermal treatment can be explained by the Kirkendall effect. Briefly, at the early stage under high temperature, Co9S8 was firstly formed on the surface of the nanoneedle templates; later, the cobalt ions at the center diffused to the surface of the nanoneedle templates and then reacted with sulfur ions to form cobalt sulphide. As the reaction time increased, the cobalt ions at the center of the nanoneedle templates were exhausted and other species, such as CO32− and Cl−, dissolved in the hydrothermal solution, resulting in the hollow nanoneedles. Furthermore, studies of the annealing effect on the crystalline degree of the Co9S8 films were conducted as well. After an annealing treatment in N2 atmosphere at 400 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2D), the crystalline degree of the Co9S8 nanoneedles was improved dramatically compared with the pristine sample (Fig. 2C), which was also confirmed by the presence of some new and strengthened diffraction peaks of the Co9S8 phase in the XRD patterns (Fig. 3B). However, the binding forces between the Co9S8 films and FTO substrates became weak and very easy to shed after hydrothermal conversion. TiCl4 pre-treatment of the FTO substrates before growing the templates (see experimental section) could enhance the binding forces between the Co9S8 films and the FTO substrates.
The electrochemical catalytic abilities of the Co9S8 films on FTO substrates were studied using Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In Tafel polarization curves, the exchange current density (J0) is directly related to the catalytic abilities of the electrodes, which can be estimated from the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches of the corresponding Tafel polarization curves. As shown in Fig. 4A, the Tafel polarization curves of the un-annealed Co9S8 and annealed Co9S8 electrodes (Co9S8-an) were both higher than that of a Pt electrode by around two orders of magnitude, implying that the J0 values of the Co9S8 and Co9S8-an electrodes were higher than that of the Pt electrode by nearly an order of magnitude, and then the electrocatalytic abilities for the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes of the Co9S8 and Co9S8-an electrodes were superior. It was found that the Tafel polarization curve of the Co9S8-an electrode was slightly higher than that of the Co9S8 electrode, suggesting a better electrocatalytic ability of the Co9S8-an electrode, which was ascribed to the higher crystallinity and thus better electron transfer pathway in the annealed Co9S8 nanoneedles. The same conclusion was obtained from the EIS test (Fig. 4B). The large semicircle of the curves accounts for a large electron transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface while the small semicircle relates to a small Rct (fitted values of Rct using ZSimpWin software and the equivalent circuit in Fig. 4B are shown in Table 1). Co9S8-an had the smallest semicircle and thus had the best electrocatalytic ability of the three electrodes.

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for the QDSCs based on Co9S8, Co9S8-an and Pt counter electrodes (CEs) were obtained under simulated sunlight. As shown in Fig. 4C and Table 1, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the QDSCs was not affected by the CE. The QDSCs with Co9S8 CEs showed a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.72 mA cm−2, which was a little higher than that with Pt CEs (14.23 mA cm−2). But the fill factor (FF) of the QDSCs with Co9S8 CEs (44.04%) was much higher than that for Pt CEs (32.00%), and consequently the efficiency of the QDSCs with Co9S8 CEs (3.13%) was much higher than that with Pt CEs (2.12%), which was ascribed to the higher electrocatalytic ability of Co9S8 in the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes used in QDSCs (Fig. 4A and B). Furthermore, the QDSCs with Co9S8-an CEs showed a higher Jsc (16.80 mA cm−2) than that with Co9S8 CEs and thus obtained a higher power conversion efficiency (3.72%), which was in line with the electrocatalytic ability discussed in the Tafel polarization and EIS sections above.

In conclusion, a method for preparing Co9S8 hollow nanoneedle array films directly grown on FTO substrates was put forward. The TiCl4 pre-treatment of the FTO substrates enhanced the binding forces between the Co9S8 films and FTO substrates. We got an improved efficiency of 3.72% from QDSCs with this Co9S8 CE and boosted the efficiency of traditional QDSCs with Pt CEs by 75%. What is more important is that our method can be applied to the preparation of other metal sulphides or even metal selenides grown on FTO substrates.
