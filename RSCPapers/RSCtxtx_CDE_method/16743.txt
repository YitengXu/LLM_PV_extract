The charge recombination at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because of the poor interface contact at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, we report the surface co-grafting of surfactants onto the surface of the TiO2 photoelectrode, and their effects on the photovoltaic performance of solid-state DSSCs. Three ionic surfactants, including anionic surfactants, sodium 2-ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and a cationic surfactant, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), were applied for the modification of the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. The results show that co-grafting of surfactants AOT or CDCA on the TiO2 photoelectrode surface, and post heat treatment (above the melting point of solid-state electrolytes) could drastically improve the interfacial contact properties of the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, increase the penetration of the electrolytes into the porous TiO2 photoelectrode, and thus enhance the photovoltaic performances of the solid-state electrolyte DSSCs. With the surface modification of AOT/N719, the succinonitrile based solid-state DSSCs exhibited superior long-term stability, and showed power conversion efficiencies of 6.75% and 7.92% under 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 100 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as an important alternative to conventional silicon-based photovoltaic devices because of their ease of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency. Recent achievements have led to a new record of 12.3% power conversion efficiency under 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 cm−2 with a cobalt (II/III)-based tris(bipyridy)tetracyanoborate complex as the redox mediator in a liquid electrolyte. Although the high conversion efficiency has been achieved by using organic liquid electrolytes, the existence of the liquid electrolyte causes several drawbacks, such as the leakage and volatilization of the organic solvent, the corrosion of the counter electrodes, and possible desorption of the surface-coated dyes, which restrict the widespread commercialization of DSSCs. In order to solve these problems, great efforts have been made to replace the organic solvent electrolytes with ionic liquid electrolytes, quasi-solid electrolytes (such as low molecular weight gels and polymer gel electrolytes), and solid-state electrolytes.

Among the solid-state electrolytes studied, organic plastic crystals have been attracting particular attention. Organic plastic crystals are a type of material composed of organic molecules exhibiting rotational and/or orientational disorder retaining long-range order and short-range rotational disorder. These plastic crystal phases with both plastic properties and good mechanical flexibility usually occur via solid–solid transitions below the melting point, which enable them to display good mechanical flexibility such as deformation under an applied stress, and high ionic conductivities either in pure or with the addition of an ionic dopant in the case of ionic plastic crystal compounds. Therefore, organic plastic crystals are considered as one of the best candidate electrolytes for solid-state electrochemical devices (such as Li-batteries, fuel cells and DSSCs), because they can facilitate not only high ionic conductivity and good electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact during the volume changes, but also eliminate the leakage problems when compared to liquid electrolytes.
Succinonitrile is a well-known molecular plastic crystal that has been investigated in solid-state DSSCs. Although a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼5% was achieved, efforts for obtaining a higher photovoltaic performance are still undergoing for the practical applications of solid-state DSSCs. In the case of solid-state DSSCs, a perfect TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface for the complete filling of the porous TiO2 films with the solid-state electrolyte is critical in determining the efficiency of the devices. It has been recognized that surface modification of the TiO2 photoelectrode could improve the interfacial properties of the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, leading to the performance enhancement of liquid electrolyte DSSCs. However, to date, little progress has been made in solid-state DSSCs through the surface modification of the TiO2 photoelectrode, which is intimately related to the development of DSSCs with high power conversion efficiency.
Here, three ionic surfactants, including anionic surfactants, sodium 2-ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and a cationic surfactant, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), were used for the surface modification of the TiO2 photoelectrode, and further applied for the plastic crystal based solid-state electrolyte in combination with dye N719 (Scheme 1). It was found that co-grafting of surfactants AOT or CDCA onto the TiO2 photoelectrode surface and post heat treatment above the melting point of solid-state electrolytes could drastically improve the interfacial properties of the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, which facilitate the penetration of the plastic crystal-based solid-state electrolyte into the porous TiO2 films, and thus enhance the power conversion efficiency of the devices. However, co-grafting of DTAB onto the TiO2 photoelectrode surface failed due to the lack of functional groups (such as carboxylic groups and phosphate groups) to conjugate with TiO2 or organic dye surfaces.

2-Ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate (AOT), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), succinonitrile and iodine (I2) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. H2PtCl6 was purchased from Aldrich. P12TFSI was synthesized following the literature method.Cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719) was purchased from Solaronix SA (Switzerland). Fluorine-doped tin oxide overlayer (FTO) glass electrodes (7 Ω Sq−1), slurries containing 20 nm-sized mesoporous and 200 nm-diameter light-scattering TiO2 colloidal were purchased from Dalian Hepat Chroma Solar Tech. Co., Ltd (China).


The fabrication of DSSCs was assembled as follows. The cleaned FTO glass plates were immersed into 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Then two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto cleaned FTO glass and used as photoelectrodes. A 5 μm-thick film of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was first deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, a second 5 μm-thick layer of 200 nm light scattering anatase particles was coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in an N719 solution (0.2 mM) containing AOT at concentrations of 0.2, 2 and 5 mM, or CDCA solution (2 mM), or DTAB solution (2 mM) in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v:v) at room temperature for 24 h. Afterward, the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried under a nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol were placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min. The electrodes and platinized conducting glass were separated by using 1a 25 μm-thick Surlyn hot-melt ring (DuPont) and sealed up by heating. The molten electrolyte was injected into warmed sandwiched cells using a vacuum backfilling system. The electrolyte injection hole on the platinized FTO counter electrode was finally sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass by heating.


Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a ProStar LC240 FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminium foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.1 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 50 and 100 mW cm−2, respectively. The contact angle measurements were performed on a video-based optical goniometer (OCA15 plus, DataPhysics Instruments, Filderstadt, Germany) using the sessile drop method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a Philips Model XL30 FEG microscope with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were recorded on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation using the AC impedance method at the forward bias voltage for the impedance measurement was −0.75 V and the frequency ranged from 0.01–105 Hz under dark conditions and the amplitude is 5 mV. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of excitation wavelength was recorded on a Keithley 2612 source meter under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp with a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4). The photoelectrochemical parameters, such as the fill factor (FF) and light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated according to the previous reports.


Surface modification of dye (N719)-coated TiO2 photoelectrodes was obtained by immersing the TiO2 film in a solution of N719 (0.2 mM) and surfactants (2 mM) in a acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) mixture at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting surfactant-modified TiO2 photoelectrodes were characterized by FTIR and UV-vis analyses.


Fig. 1 shows the normalized and attenuated total reflectance FTIR spectra of the AOT/N719, CDCA/N719 and DTAB/N719 coated TiO2 photoelectrodes. In the spectrum of N719 alone, the features at 1375 cm−1 and 1715 cm−1 are ascribed to the COOH groups which are chemisorbed and physisorbed onto the TiO2 surface, respectively. In the case of TiO2 stained with N719/AOT, we can see that the symmetric SO stretching band is shift from 1055 cm−1 to 1045 cm−1, and the intensity of the carbonyl-band at 1725 cm−1 of the AOT/N719 is nearly twice as high as that of the N719 alone (Fig. 1a). It has already been recognized that AOT could adsorb on the TiO2 photoelectrode surface through the dye molecules. Therefore, these two main features indicate that hydrogen-bonding interaction between the carboxyl (COOH) group of the dye molecule and the sulfonate (SO3−) group of AOT enables the chemisorption of AOT (see Fig. 2a). In the spectrum of CDCA/N719, the prominent features are that the intensity of the CO band (at ∼1370 cm−1) is nearly twice as high as that of the N719 alone (1375 cm−1), and the presence of the band at 1171 cm−1, which is ascribed to C–OH (Fig. 1b). These findings infer that CDCA could be adsorbed on the TiO2 surface through the carboxyl groups (see Fig. 2b). However, no difference between the FTIR spectra of N719 alone and DTAB/N719 was observed (Fig. 1c). It can be ascertained that the DTAB molecules were removed after the sufficient rinsing because of the lack of functional groups (such as carboxylic and phosphate groups) to conjugate with TiO2 or organic dye molecules.
The amount of dye loading on the surfactant modified TiO2 photoanodes was investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3. It is noteworthy that a higher dye loading was obtained at the concentration of 0.2 mM AOT as compared with N719 alone, indicating that a relatively low concentration of AOT could increase the coverage of dye N719 on the TiO2 photoelectrode surface. However, a higher concentration of AOT decreased the absorption of the dye N719 probably due to the Y-shaped structure of AOT which retarded the dye adsorption during the anchoring process. A relatively high dye loading is favourable for light harvesting, and thus could enhance the photocurrent of DSSCs. Therefore, 0.2 mM AOT was chosen for the surface-modification of the TiO2 photoelectrode surface, and further applied for solid-state DSSCs. Additionally, the dye loading of AOT/N719 is higher than that of N719/CDCA as the surfactant. This result may be due to the direct chemisorption of the CDCA on the TiO2 surface, which decreased the bare surface area of the TiO2 photoelectrode and prevented the absorption of the organic dyes, as shown in Fig. 2.

The TiO2 photoelectrodes with the surface modification of surfactants were applied for succinonitrile based solid-state electrolyte DSSCs. The solid-state electrolyte composed of 0.5 M N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium iodide ([C4mpyr][I], P14I) and 0.1 M I2 in succinonitrile was prepared for the DSSCs. The melting point of the electrolyte is around 45 °C.Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of the fabricated solid-state electrolyte DSSCs with and without surface modification of TiO2 under simulated AM 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The detailed photovoltaic parameters including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE values of the DSSCs are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that all the four freshly prepared DSSCs exhibited similar photovoltaic properties, and similar PCE values were obtained (Fig .4a and Table 1). It is interesting that the PCE values of AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 were highly improved after the cells were heated at 60 °C for 10 min (Fig. 4b and Table 1). For example, after the heat treatment, the overall power conversion efficiency increased from 4.92% to 6.75%, and from 4.88% to 6.01%, for AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719, respectively. However, DTAB/N719 does not enhance the photovoltaic performances of the devices, even after the heat treatment of the devices at 60 °C for 10 min, because DTAB molecules could not conjugate with TiO2 or organic dye molecules. To avoid batch-to-batch variations in the efficiency, cells from three batches were compared. In this manner, clear trends in the efficiency improvement after being heated at 60 °C for 10 min were observed (see ESI, Table S1, Fig. S1 and S2).

To get insight into the above-mentioned results, the effects of the surfactants AOT and CDCA on the TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interfacial properties were investigated by measuring the contact angles of molten succinonitrile on the surface of the TiO2 photoanode sensitized with N719 alone, AOT/N719, and CDCA/N719, respectively (Fig. 5). The contact angles for the TiO2 films treated with AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 were determined to be 18.0° and 23.0°, respectively. Both the values were lower than that for N719 alone (35.5°). Fig. 6 shows the dynamic contact angle measurements of molten succinonitrile for TiO2 films sensitized with AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719. A 2 μl droplet rapidly spreads out and the contact angle decreases much faster to close to 0° after 90 seconds. While in the case of the TiO2 photoanodes sensitized with N719 alone, the contact angle decreases to about 8° and then remains constant. These results indicated that the molten succinonitrile based electrolyte could wet the AOT/N719 and AOT/N719 sensitized TiO2 surfaces better than that with N719 alone. The different wetting behaviors lead to differences in pore-filling ability.
It has already been demonstrated that the penetration of the TiO2 photoelectrode into the solid-state electrolyte has a dominant influence on the device performance. The electrolyte penetration of the porous TiO2 photoelectrode could be investigated by cross-sectional SEM images, as shown in Fig. 7. It can be clearly seen that the succinonitrile electrolyte filled in the pores of the TiO2 layer was evidenced as the relatively darker areas. Here, the device with N719 alone exhibited a poor penetration level, even after the heat treatment (Fig. 7a). The dark areas are shifted towards the lower end for the devices with AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719, indicating good electrolyte penetration and filling of the porous TiO2 films in both cases (Fig. 7b and c). In addition, the shift is much more pronounced for the AOT/N719 than that for the CDCA/N719. The nearly uniform density throughout the nanoporous TiO2 layer of AOT/N719 directly reflects the higher degree of pore-filling. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surfactants AOT and CDCA greatly increased the penetration of the solid-state electrolyte into porous TiO2 films after the heat treatment, leading to good contact between the electrolyte and the TiO2 photoanode. These results are consistent with the photovoltaic parameters of the devices.

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool to provide valuable information for the understanding of photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs. Here, EIS measurements were performed to gain further insight into the influence of the surfactants on the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interfacial properties. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist of the DSSCs before and after the heat treatment based on the TiO2 photoanodes sensitized with N719 alone and with N719/surfactants (AOT or CDCA) in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz at the bias potential of Voc under dark conditions. In general, the impedance spectra showed three predominant semicircles. From high to low frequency, three characteristic arcs of R1, R2, and R3 represent the resistance of the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface, the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte, respectively. The determined R1, R2, and R3 values are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that no big difference of the N719-based cell was observed before and after the heat treatment. While the R1 value decreased from 2.40 to 0.29, and from 2.73 to 0.61, respectively, for AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 based cells, indicating that the surfactants CDCA and AOT improve the wetting behavior of the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, and thus facilitate the penetration of the solid-state electrolyte into the mesoporous TiO2.

The estimated R2 values listed in Table 2 show less electron recombination with triiodides in the electrolyte for AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 based cells after the heat treatment. The lower electron recombination with triiodides in the electrolyte decreases the highly effective charge collection to FTO glass and enhances the Jsc of the device (see Table 1). In addition, the effective retardation of electron recombination at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces ultimately improves the Voc value. The electron lifetimes (τe) extracted from fmax at the mid frequency peak in the Bode phase plots (insets of Fig. 8) are 2.95, 4.29 and 3.41 ms for N719 alone, AOT/N719 and N719/CDCA, respectively. These results support the heat treatment in favor of good filling results in lower recombination reaction between the photo-injected electrons and the electrolyte interface after TiO2 photoanode modification by surfactants. It is also worth noting that the DSSCs based on AOT/N719 showed the longest electron lifetimes when compared with that of N719 alone and CDCA/N719, suggesting that AOT/N719 could effectively decrease the electrons in the TiO2 film from recombining with the electrolyte and thus yield the highest PCE values.

Fig. 9 shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the fabricated DSSCs based on the N719 alone, AOT/N719, CDCA/N719 and DTAB/N719 after the heat treatment. It is not surprising that the IPCE values of the N719 alone and DTAB/N719 were lower than those of AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719, mainly due to the charge recombination caused by the incomplete filling leading to unwanted intermolecular energy transfer or nonradiative decay pathways, and thus reducing the electron effective collection efficiency. In both the cases of AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719, even though the dye loading on the TiO2 surface was relatively lower, the maximum IPCE value improved up to 63% and 55%, respectively. The significant improvement of IPCE should be attributed to the improved dye regeneration and charge collection because of the improved pore filling of the electrolyte. In addition, the AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 not only reduce the dye aggregation but also prevent I3− from approaching the dye, which in turn decrease the charge recombination and hence improve charge collection and dye regeneration. The cells based on AOT/N719 exhibited an 8% higher maximum IPCE value than that of CDCA/N719 due to the higher dye loading and wetting ability which lead to the higher light harvesting efficiency. This effect can be observed in electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 8b). The photoelectric conversion efficiencies under both high and low simulated sunlight irradiation are also summarized in Table 3. The highest power conversion efficiencies of 6.75% and 7.92% are achieved for the cells based on AOT/N719 under 1.5 solar spectrum illuminations at 100 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively.

The long-term stability of the fabricated solid-state DSSCs was investigated over a period of 800 h under 1 sun illumination at 30 °C as shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the maximal efficiency retains at a nearly similar level for at least 1 month, which shows that the process occurring after the heat treatment improved the device performance to a stable level. It also can be seen that both the AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 exhibited a high stability in the DSSC system. The efficiency remained 100% of the initial value after 800 h, demonstrating the superior long-term stability of the plastic crystal electrolyte-based DSSCs.

An organic ionic plastic crystal with a melting point above 60 °C is desirable for outdoor application under natural conditions, which may reach readily 60–80 °C under full sunlight. Therefore, the effects of surfactants (AOT and CDCA) on a well-known organic ionic plastic crystal, 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (P12TFSI, melting point: ∼90 °C), based solid-state DSSCs were further studied. The electrolyte was composed of 0.8 g P12TFSI, 0.2 g PMII, 0.0142 g I2, 0.5 M N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB) and 0.1 M LiI. The melting point of the prepared solid-state electrolyte is determined to be 75 °C.


Fig. 11 shows the J–V curves of the P12TFSI based solid-state DSSCs with N719 alone, AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 under the simulated AM 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2, after the heat treatment at 80 °C for 10 min. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the solid-state DSSCs are listed in Table 4. It can be seen that both AOT/N719 and CDCA/N719 enhance the PCE values of the devices. For example, the power conversion efficiency of AOT/N719 increased from 3.78% to 5.87% after the heat treatment. Therefore, it can be concluded again that both two surfactants AOT and CDCA could effectively improve the interfacial properties of the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte surface and increase the penetration of the electrolytes into porous TiO2 films after the heat treatment, leading to the enhancement of high-temperature solid-state electrolyte DSSCs.

This work reported a facile and effective way for the performance enhancement of solid-state DSSCs. Three ionic surfactants, including AOT, CDCA, and DTAB were applied for the surface modification of the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. Co-grafting of surfactants AOT and CDCA, and post heat treatment could effectively improve the interfacial properties of the photoelectrode/electrolyte surface, increase the penetration of the solid-state electrolytes into the porous TiO2 photoelectrode, and enhance the photovoltaic performance of the solid-state electrolyte DSSCs. For further improvement of photovoltaic performance, the adsorption mechanism of the dyes and surfactants including the conformational behaviour of chained co-adsorbents on the surfaces of a semiconductor layer should be more clearly elucidated. Although only organic plastic crystal based solid-state electrolytes were investigated in this work, we believe that this method could be extended to other solid-state electrolytes.
