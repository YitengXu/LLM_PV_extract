In this paper, a series of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type oligomers were investigated for their structural and electronic properties through density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) calculations. The designed compounds consist of five different donor units linked at the ortho position of the perylene core of the perylene diimide (PDI) acceptor via five different π-bridging units. We have calculated the dihedral angle, average inter-ring bridge bond distance (l), inter-ring torsional angle (ϕ), distortion energy (ΔEdis), bond length alteration (BLA) parameter (Δr), energy band gap (ΔH–L) values, partial density of states (PDOS), ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS) analysis, transition dipole moment, reorganization energy (λ), electronic coupling matrix element (V), charge transfer rates (kCT), hopping mobility (μhop), electron density difference (EDD), natural transition orbital (NTO) and spectral absorption properties of the studied compounds. The MEPS plots suggest that the studied compounds have significant charge transport properties. From the EDD map analysis, it is clear that the Sg → S1 transition involves greater charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit via the π-bridging unit in all compounds. Further, the NTO analysis confirms the transfer of electron density from the donor to the acceptor unit after electronic excitation of the compounds. We have also studied the absorption and photovoltaic properties of the D/A blends by considering KM-10 as a standard donor and C60-CN as a standard acceptor. The study suggests that complex KM-10/PDI-BITHN-4 with a theoretical PCE of 19.26% can be chosen as the potential candidate for application in organic solar cells (OSCs). Thus, our study provides recommendations for further development of efficient D/A complexes so as to improve the performance of OSCs.

Over the last few years, researchers have been fascinated by π-conjugated polymers because of their unique electro-optical and semiconducting properties and potential application in various electronic devices, such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), etc. OPV devices, especially small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs), have received a great deal of interest due to their potential to serve as alternate reasonable sources of renewable energy. Small organic molecules are highly promising as oligomers and display various advantages such as low band gap, low cost, easy fabrication, flexibility, and abundant availability. The charge transport properties of oligomers must be considered as key factors to achieve better performance of optoelectronic devices. It is therefore important to carry out various research studies for exploring a favorable relationship between the structural properties and charge carrier mobility of oligomers.

In general, the semiconducting behavior of π-conjugated semiconductors is realized due to delocalization of π-molecular orbitals, mostly in the direction of molecular chain along the conjugation length. As compared to inorganic systems, viz., commonly used Si, the relatively large band gap and moderate charge density restrict the performance of π-conjugated semiconductors in optoelectronic devices. However, to overcome these restrictions, a well-configured scheme can be adopted based on the donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) architecture. This kind of architecture promotes efficient intramolecular charge transfer from the donor moiety to its acceptor units via its π-conjugated spacer. For an efficient organic π-conjugated semiconducting material, there should be a suitable energy band gap (ΔH–L) between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) so that electrons and holes can be injected into the polymer surface from the metal electrode. Further, the ΔH–L values of D–π–A based molecules can be finely tuned in view of a suitable choice of donor and acceptor moieties. Proper tuning of the ΔH–L value of D–π–A based molecules is proven to be efficient as it depends mainly on the ionization potential (IP) of donor and the electron affinity (EA) of acceptor moieties. This type of popular and normally applicable strategy allows us to rationally design and study organic molecules based on the D–π–A architecture that can absorb light with wavelengths in the infrared and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such a strategy would be very useful for optoelectronic applications and particularly for organic solar cells (OSCs). In the past two decades, fullerenes and their derivatives ([6,6]-phenyl C61/C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM and PC71BM)) have been used universally as the electron acceptor materials of OSCs due to their high EA and mobility, exceptional electron transport properties and high efficiency in producing solar cells, particularly when blended with low band gap electron donating polymers.
In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have also attracted much interest of researchers due to their low-cost synthesis and highly tunable properties by chemical modifications. So far, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 18% has been reported for OSCs based on NFAs. Within the NFA library, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives are widely studied due to their chemical and physical properties such as better electron accepting capability, high electron mobility, and particularly, owing to it's proper alignment of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels, etc. In a PDI molecular structure, there are three positions, viz., bay, ortho, and imide positions for functionalization. The core structure of the PDI unit is shown in Fig. 1.
By introducing other moieties at the bay, ortho, and imide positions, the PDI molecular structure can be modified to disturb the planarity for the construction of twisted configurations. Functionalization at bay positions is a facile synthesis route to regulate the optical and electronic properties and serves as the easiest way to minimize the aggregation of PDI derivatives. However, unfortunately, functionalization at the bay positions often leads to twisting of the perylene core, which interrupts the π-stacking of the π-surface and lessens the electron transport in the bulk state in thin-film transistors. Besides, functionalization at imide positions is not as effective as that at bay positions and ortho positions due to limited substituents, the presence of nodes at the imide nitrogen positions and little effect on the optical and electronic properties of PDIs. In this respect, functionalization at ortho positions can effectively improve the performance of the devices and maintains the planarity of the perylene π-plane. It also provides a promising way to tune the properties of perylene dyes without geometric distortion of the PDI core.
To enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices, a simple strategy is to modify any of the donor, π-bridge and acceptor moieties. In the present research work, we have designed D–π–A type oligomers based on five different donor units, viz., dithienothiophene (DTT), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), benzodithiophene (BDT), biisothianaphthene (BITHN) and 5,5-dimethyl-5,13-dihydrobenzothieno[3,2-c]acridine (BTAC), linked to the PDI acceptor unit through five different π-bridging units, viz., thiophene (THP), ethynylthienothiophene (ETHNTHP), furan (FN), acetylene (ACE), and bisthienothiophene (BISTHNTHP). The compounds having the π-bridging units THP, ETHNTHP, FN, ACE and BISTHNTHP are represented by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (as shown in Fig. 2). The structures of the designed monomer units are illustrated in Fig. 2.
Our aim is two-fold. Firstly, we tune the optoelectronic properties of these designed molecules by substituting the PDI acceptor unit at the ortho position of the perylene core instead of the bay position. To the best of our knowledge, this type of theoretical investigation has been unexplored. Secondly, we look into the role of the designed small donor and acceptor molecules in the charge transfer process at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. Further, quantum chemical methods have been used to investigate the geometric structures, electrical properties, optical characteristics, and charge transfer processes in order to achieve this aim. Moreover, the electron transport processes have been investigated by considering KM-10 as a standard donor and C60-CN as a standard acceptor for the designed small acceptors and donors, respectively.
Herein, computational methods are used to determine various electronic properties, viz., ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS), transition dipole moment, reorganization energy (λ), electronic coupling matrix element (V), charge transfer rates (kCT), hopping mobility (μhop), electron density difference (EDD) and natural transition orbital (NTO). We have also studied the absorption properties of the designed molecules. To keep the computational cost under control, we have confined our calculation up to trimers (n = 3). Henceforth, we will mention the dimers and trimers as “oligomers”. The coordinates of the studied monomers are provided in Table S1 (ESI).

All calculations have been carried out using the Gaussian 09 program package. Initially, it is vital to carry out an extensive study for better validation of the applied methodology opted throughout the calculations. In this regard, we have performed a test calculation with the compound PDI-DTT (bay-substituted PDI-DTT) reported in the literature because it has structural similarity to our designed dyes. We have performed both ground state and excited state calculations using seven different functionals, viz., B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d), B3PW91/6-31G(d), CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d), HSEH1PBE/6-31G(d), PBEPBE/6-31G(d), and wB97XD/6-31G(d), by employing the density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) methods. We have also correlated the calculated energies of the HOMO and LUMO, difference between the energies of the HOMO and LUMO (ΔH–L), and absorption wavelength (λmax) values with the experimental results. The respective results are reported in Table S2 (ESI). From this table, it is observed that the results of ground state calculations using the functional B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) are in better agreement with the experimental results. On the other hand, the results of the excited state calculations using the functionals CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) and wB97XD/6-31G(d) agree well with the experimentally reported values. However, to keep the computational cost under control, we have used the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory for the excited state calculations. For the solvent phase calculations, we have employed a conductor like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) incorporating chloroform as a solvent. Besides, all ground state and excited state calculations have been carried out at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) and CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) levels of theory, respectively. The optimized geometry of the oligomers have been verified towards the minimum-energy points by vibrational analysis. We have computed the vertical and adiabatic IP (i.e., IP(v) and IP(a)), vertical and adiabatic EA (i.e., EA(v) and EA(a)), λ, and kCT for all the monomers at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level of theory. Moreover, the energies of the HOMO and LUMO and ΔH–L have been computed for monomers, dimers, and trimers in both the gas phase and the solvent phase at the same level of theory. However, the MEPS, EDD and NTO analyses have been employed at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.


It is widely known that the performance of a photovoltaic device is mainly affected by two factors, viz., the stability of holes and electrons, and the energy barrier of the charge injection process. Many studies have been carried out to estimate the effect of the HOMO–LUMO energies, and the IPs and EAs of the molecules on the charge injection ability. In addition to IP and EA, λ also serves as a key parameter for determining the energy barrier of the charge injection process of organic polymers.

We have calculated the values of IP(v), IP(a), EA(v) and EA(a) using the following equations:
IP(v) = E+(M°) − E°(M°),
(1)
IP(a) = E+(M+) − E°(M°),
(2)
EA(v) = E°(M°) − E−(M°),
(3)
EA(a) = E°(M°) − E−(M−),
(4)
where
E°, E+, and E− represent the energies of the molecules in the neutral, cationic and anionic states, respectively. Similarly, M°, M+, and M− represent the neutral, cationic and anionic geometries of the molecules, respectively. The potential energy curves for the neutral, cationic and anionic species are graphically presented in Fig. 3.


λ is usually defined as the energy change that arises due to structural reorganization of the molecule to diminish the effect of its excess charge. Generally, λ has contributions from the inner sphere and the outer sphere. The inner sphere portion arises due to the geometry relaxation process associated with the charge accepted or released by the molecule and the outer sphere portion arises from the electron/nuclei relaxation process or polarization of the surrounding medium. In this work, we have considered only the inner sphere contribution. We have calculated the λ values for holes (λh) and electrons (λe) using the following equations:
(5)
(6)
Typically, charge carrier motions can be explained by both the coherent band model and the incoherent hopping model. At high temperatures, the hopping type mechanism is predicted to be more prevalent. Based on Marcus theory, kCT between two adjacent molecules can be determined. kCT can be related to λ. The relevant expression for kCT can be given by the following equation:
(7)
where
kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, V is the electronic coupling matrix element between two molecules and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

The V (also called the charge transfer integral) values for holes (V+) and electrons (V−) can be calculated by using eqn (8):
(8)
where
EH, EH−1, EL and EL+1 represent the energies of the HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO, and LUMO+1, respectively, of the closed-shell configuration of the neutral state of the molecules. For efficient charge transfer the values of V need to be larger and depend on the orbital overlap between two molecules.

Another parameter is μhop which helps in quantifying the electron or hole transporting character of the molecules. μhop can be estimated from the value of kCT with the help of Einstein's equation using eqn (9):
(9)
where
e denotes the electronic charge and D is the diffusion coefficient. In a one-dimensional charge transfer process, D and kCT can be correlated to one another with the help of eqn (10):

(10)
where
l represents the space distance between two interacting molecules.

The power conversion efficiency (η) of a photovoltaic device can be generally expressed using eqn (11):
(11)
where FF,
Voc, Jsc, and Pin represent the fill factor, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and input power of incident sunlight, respectively. The standard Pin value for the solar spectrum is 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination.

FF is one of the main parameters that influence the η value. We have calculated the FF values using eqn (12). This equation calculates the FF under ideal conditions.
(12)
Here, νoc represents the dimensionless voltage and can be obtained by using eqn (13):
(13)
where
e, kB, and T represent the elementary charge, Boltzmann constant, and absolute temperature, respectively.

The value of eVoc can be estimated using eqn (14):
eVoc = (|EDonorHOMO − EAcceptorLUMO|) − 0.3 eV,
(14)
where
EDonorHOMO and EAcceptorLUMO represent the HOMO energy of the donor molecule and LUMO energy of the acceptor molecule, respectively. The value of 0.3 is an empirical factor representing the typical energy loss within the bulk heterojunction organic solar cells.

Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME) model is a powerful tool to estimate the theoretical PCEs of solar cells. Here, the SLME model is employed to evaluate the short circuit current density (Jsc) by applying eqn (15):
(15)
where
P is the maximum power density, J is the total current density, V is the potential over the absorbed layer, J0 is the reverse saturation current density, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and e is the elementary charge. It is noticeable that the Jsc of a device depends on the intensity and spectral range of solar absorption. Jsc is a function of the external quantum efficiency (ηEQE) of the device and photon number S(λ) over the whole frequency region. It can be defined as

(16)
where
ηEQE is the product of exciton diffusion efficiency (ηED), light harvesting efficiency (ηλ), charge collection efficiency (ηCC) and charge transfer efficiency (ηCT). From the above equation it is clear that the absorption capacity of a material serves as a vital factor for the increased efficiency of the solar cell. The light harvesting efficiency, ηλ, can be correlated to the oscillator strength (fosc) of a particular wavelength as follows:

ηλ = 1 − 10−fosc.

Dihedral angle is considered as one of the most prominent parameters due to its control over the planarity of the molecules. We have taken into account the ground state geometry of the monomers in both the gas and solvent phases and evaluated the dihedral angles between the donor and the π-bridging unit (D–π), and the π-bridging unit and the acceptor (π–A) of the respective monomers. The representation of the dihedral angle in a monomer is provided in Fig. S1 (ESI). The values of the dihedral angles of the studied compounds are reported in Table 1.

From Table 1 it can be observed that the dihedral angle values are changed on attachment of different electron donors and π-bridging units. Among the studied compounds, monomers PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BITHN-4 and PDI-BTAC-4 having the ACE π-bridging unit possess the minimum values of D–π and π–A angles in both phases. This manifests that the respective monomers will have comparatively planar structures with a greater extent of conjugation in the π-conjugated backbone. Conversely, monomers PDI-DTT-1, PDI-EDOT-3, PDI-BDT-1, PDI-BITHN-2 and PDI-BTAC-2 possess the maximum values of D–π angles among their groups of dyes in both phases. Besides, the π–A angles are observed to be maximum for the monomers PDI-DTT-2, PDI-EDOT-5, PDI-BDT-2, PDI-BITHN-2 and PDI-BTAC-2 in both phases. As a result, there will be a decrease in the extent of conjugation in the π-conjugated backbone for the monomers that possess the maximum values of dihedral angle.

We have calculated the average inter-ring bridge bond distance (l) values for all the monomers and the same are reported in Table 2. The representation of the average inter-ring bridge bond distance is provided in Fig. S2 (ESI).

From Table 2 it can be observed that the l values of all the studied compounds are longer than the CC double bond distance (1.33 Å) and shorter than the C–C single bond distance (1.54 Å). Besides, the l values of compounds PDI-BTAC-1, PDI-BTAC-2 and PDI-BTAC-5 are observed to be comparatively longer than those of the other compounds. This observation reflects a decrease in the extent of conjugation in these compounds upon attachment of the π-bridging units THP, ETHNTHP, and BISTHNTHP, respectively. Conversely, the l values of compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BITHN-4 and PDI-BTAC-4 are observed to be shorter than those of the remaining compounds which in turn reflects an increase in the extent of conjugation on attachment of the ACE π-bridging unit in these compounds. Among the studied compounds, the lowest value of l is observed for the compound PDI-BITHN-4. Hence, the extent of conjugation is supposed to be maximum in this compound.

We have calculated the values of the inter-ring torsional angles (ϕ1 and ϕ2) for all the monomers and the same are reported in Table 3. The pictorial representation of the inter-ring torsional angles (ϕ1 and ϕ2) in a monomer is provided in Fig. S2 (ESI).

From Table 3, it can be observed that the inter-ring torsional angles (ϕ1 and ϕ2) of compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BITHN-4 and PDI-BTAC-4 are found to be in the range of 171°–176° (∼180°). This observation suggests that these compounds with the planar ACE π-bridging unit will have comparatively planar structures than the other compounds. Conversely, in the case of compounds PDI-DTT-3, PDI-EDOT-3, PDI-BDT-3, PDI-BITHN-3 and PDI-BTAC-3, the ϕ1 and ϕ2 values fall in the range of 116°–119° which suggests that these compounds will have comparatively less planar structures.

Distortion energy (ΔEdis) can be defined as the amount of energy required to planarize the molecules. It is crucial to establish a relationship between the geometric structure and the electronic properties of the monomers. To calculate the ΔEdis values, the dihedral angles of the molecules have been adjusted to zero to planarize them and then single-point energy calculations have been performed at the planarized geometries. The energy difference between the planarized and the neutral geometry (i.e., Eplanarized − Eneutral) yields the ΔEdis value. We have calculated the values of Eplanarized, Eneutral and ΔEdis of the studied monomers and the same are reported in Table 4 and Table S6 (ESI).

From Table 4 it can be observed that compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-4 and PDI-BTAC-4 possess lower values of ΔEdis compared to the other compounds. Among them, PDI-BDT-4 possesses the lowest ΔEdis value (0.01 kcal mol−1). These values are in accordance with the ϕ values (reported in Table 3). Therefore, this manifests that the respective compounds with the planar ACE π-bridging unit exhibit comparatively planar structures among all the studied compounds.

The bond length alteration (BLA) parameter (Δr) is another key geometrical parameter which helps in establishing the geometric structure–electronic property relationship between the π-conjugated polymers. The BLA parameter helps us to relate the HOMO–LUMO gap, photon absorption characteristics, transport properties, linear–nonlinear polarizabilities of the molecules, etc. It also serves as a measure to determine the extent of π-conjugation present in a molecule. The difference between the average C–C double and C–C single bonds of a particular conjugated system is known as the BLA parameter. The calculated values of the average BLA parameters of the rings present in the monomers are reported in Table 5 and the same are plotted graphically in Fig. 4.

From Table 5 and Fig. 4, it can be observed that the Δr values of all the studied monomers are smaller than 0.051 Å which indicates the higher delocalization of the electrons along the π-conjugated backbone. Among the studied compounds, the PDI-BITHN groups of monomers possess lower Δr values compared to the other groups of monomers with monomer PDI-BITHN-5 having the lowest Δr value. This observation reflects the existence of a greater amount of conjugation in monomer PDI-BITHN-5 by the BISTHNTHP π-bridging unit. Conversely, the PDI-EDOT groups of monomers show comparatively higher Δr values than the other groups of monomers with monomer PDI-EDOT-4 having the highest Δr value. The highest Δr value of the monomer PDI-EDOT-4 suggests the existence of a smaller amount of conjugation by the ACE π-bridging unit along with the EDOT donor moiety.

FMO analysis is considered as one of the prominent factors that has an impact on the charge transport properties of OSCs. The FMO energies of the studied compounds can be correlated to their electronic properties. Based on the ground state calculations, the energies of the HOMO and LUMO and the ΔH–L values of all the studied oligomers are reported in Tables 6 and 7 for both gas and solvent phases, respectively.

From Tables 6 and 7 it is evident that the calculated energy values of the HOMO and LUMO, and ΔH–L follow the same trend for both gas and solvent phases. Among the studied oligomers, compound PDI-BITHN-5 possesses the lowest value of ΔH–L for the three oligomers in both the gas and solvent phases. This observed lowest ΔH–L value is due to the highest destabilization of the HOMO energy levels. On the other hand, compound PDI-EDOT-4 possesses the highest value of ΔH–L for the three oligomers in both gas and solvent phases due to the highest destabilization of the LUMO energy levels.
It is also observed that the ΔH–L values (reported in both Tables 6 and 7) are largely dependent on the attached π-bridging units in both gas and solvent phases. In compounds PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-5, PDI-BDT-5, PDI-BITHN-5 and PDI-BTAC-5, all having the BISTHNTHP π-bridging unit, the ΔH–L values get reduced due to an increase in the extent of conjugation along the molecular backbone. Conversely, an increasing trend in the ΔH–L values is also observed (in compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BITHN-4 and PDI-BTAC-4) when both the donor and acceptor moieties are flanked by the ACE π-bridging unit. This observation is in correlation with the decrease in the extent of conjugation along the molecular backbone, which results in an increase of the ΔH–L values. In this regard, the plot of the FMOs of compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-EDOT-5, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BDT-5, PDI-BITHN-4, PDI-BITHN-5, PDI-BTAC-4 and PDI-BTAC-5 (provided in Fig. 5 for both gas and solvent phases) supports the observed facts. From Fig. 5 it is observed that, on attachment of the ACE π-bridging unit in compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BITHN-4 and PDI-BTAC-4, the HOMOs are delocalized over the entire π-conjugated backbone, whereas their LUMOs are concentrated on the acceptor part. On the other hand, the HOMOs of compounds PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-5, PDI-BDT-5, PDI-BITHN-5 and PDI-BTAC-5 are delocalized over both the π-bridging unit and donor part, whereas their LUMOs are concentrated on the acceptor part. Therefore, the above observed facts can be justified from Fig. 5 which suggests the similarity of the FMOs of all the studied compounds in both phases.

The density of states (DOS) is defined as the number of states available at a particular energy level convenient for electrons. The partial DOS signifies the relative contribution of a particular orbital or atom to the total DOS. For a detailed correlation between the electronic structures and the FMOs, we have calculated the PDOS of the studied monomer compounds and their respective spectral data are reported in Table S3 (ESI). From Table S3 (ESI), it can be observed that the donor unit offers the maximum contribution to the HOMOs in almost all the studied compounds, except PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-2, PDI-EDOT-5, PDI-BDT-5 and PDI-BTAC-5. This exception might occur due to attachment of the BISTHNTHP and ETHNTHP π-bridging units which offer the maximum contribution to the HOMOs. Moreover, in all compounds the minimum contribution is observed from the acceptor unit to the HOMOs, except PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4 and PDI-BITHN-4 where the ACE π-bridging unit contributes minimally. Conversely, in all compounds the acceptor unit offers the maximum contribution to the LUMOs. On the other hand, the donor unit contributes minimally to the LUMOs, except PDI-DTT-4, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BITHN-3, PDI-BITHN-4 and PDI-BTAC-4 where the donor unit possesses an equal or a higher contribution compared to the π-bridging unit. Therefore, the above observed facts suggest that the attached BISTHNTHP and ETHNTHP π-bridging units increase the contribution towards the HOMOs, whereas the attached ACE π-bridging unit decreases the contribution to the LUMOs. The PDOS spectra of compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-4 and PDI-EDOT-5 are presented in Fig. 6 and the spectra for the other compounds are provided in Fig. S3 (ESI). The PDOS spectra provide a clear insight towards the nature of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and also supports the above observed facts.


IP and EA are two key parameters that provide information about the nature of charge transport properties in organic materials. For organic materials to serve as p-type semiconductors, the IP values should be low so that hole injection becomes easier into the HOMOs. Conversely, high EA values are required for organic materials to act as n-type semiconductors so that electron injection becomes easier into the LUMOs. We have calculated the values of IP(v), IP(a), EA(v) and EA(a) of the studied monomers in the gas phase and the same are reported in Table 8.

From Table 8 it can be observed that the values of IP(v), IP(a), EA(v) and EA(a) are largely dependent on the attached π-bridging units. The IP(v) and IP(a) values are observed to be low for compounds PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-5, PDI-BDT-5, PDI-BITHN-5 and PDI-BTAC-5 among the groups where the donor and acceptor moieties are linked by the BISTHNTHP π-bridging unit. Among these compounds, compound PDI-BITHN-5 possesses the lowest values of IP(v) and IP(a) which indicates easy hole injection into the HOMOs of this compound. On the other hand, both the EA(v) and EA(a) values are comparatively higher for compounds PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-5, PDI-BDT-5, PDI-BITHN-5 and PDI-BTAC-5, among the groups. Among these compounds, compound PDI-BDT-5 possesses the highest values of EA(v) and EA(a) which in turn signifies a favorable electron injection into the LUMOs of this compound. It is also observed that the IP(v) values are higher than their adiabatic counterparts in all the studied compounds. Alternatively, the EA(v) values are observed to be comparatively lower than those of their adiabatic counterparts.

In order to attain a qualitative understanding of the nature of charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, we have obtained the MEPS plot of the studied monomers. The obtained MEPS contour plots of representative compounds PDI-DTT-3, PDI-DTT-4, PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-4, and PDI-EDOT-5 are provided in Fig. 7 and those for the other compounds are provided in Fig. S4 (ESI).

We have extracted the MEPS contour plots from the total self-consistent field (SCF) density [isovalue = 0.0004 a.u.; mapped with the electrostatic potential surface]. The positive potential increases in the following color order: red < orange < yellow < green < blue. Here, the red color represents the electron-rich region and the blue color represents the electron-deficient region. From Fig. 7 and Fig. S4 (ESI), it can be observed that all compounds exhibit a significant charge separation. Therefore, from the MEPS contour plots it can be inferred that all our designed compounds have the potential to become suitable candidates for fabrication of organic photovoltaics.

The transition dipole moment of an oligomer is mainly linked with the length of its oligomeric chain and it increases upon going from the monomer to the trimer. A high value of transition dipole moment is required for a material to absorb a large number of photons. The evolution of the transition dipole moment from the ground state to the excited state (Sg → S1) vertical transition as a function of the number of repeating units (n) for the studied oligomers (i.e., for monomers, dimers and trimers) is presented in Fig. 8. From this figure the value of transition dipole moment is observed to be the highest for compound PDI-EDOT-2.


There are two dominant factors, viz., structural and electronic effects, that help in determining the values of λh and λe. For effective charge transport, the λh or λe value of the compound should be small. The lower value of λh reflects the hole transporting nature of the compound. Conversely, a lower λe value indicates that the compound will have electron transporting ability. It is prominent that the amount of reorganization energy can be determined by the conjugation chain length of the compound. The longer the length of the conjugation chain, the smaller the values of λh and λe. Moreover, the non-bonding nature of the FMOs and the rigidity of the molecular backbone are also responsible for the smaller reorganization energy values. We have calculated the values of λh and λe for the studied monomers and the same are reported in Table 9. From Table 9 it can be observed that the λh values are smaller than the λe values for the compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-3, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BTAC-1, PDI-BTAC-2, PDI-BTAC-3 and PDI-BTAC-4. Hence, the ease of hole transport in these compounds will be high. However, for the remaining compounds, the λe values are smaller than the λh values which indicates that these compounds will demand less energy for electron transport.

In order to measure the values of V, we have studied the π-stacking arrangement of the compounds and the corresponding values are reported in Table 9. The optimized structure of the compound in the π-stacking arrangement is presented in Fig. S5 (ESI). We have used the V values obtained from the π-stacking arrangement to calculate the charge transfer rates for holes (kCT+) and electrons (kCT−). The corresponding values are also reported in Table 9. From Table 9 it can be observed that, for compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-3, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BTAC-1, PDI-BTAC-2, PDI-BTAC-3 and PDI-BTAC-4, the kCT+ values are higher than the kCT− values. Therefore, these compounds will act as hole-transporting materials. On the other hand, the kCT− values are higher than the kCT+ values for the remaining compounds. Therefore, these compounds will act as electron-transporting materials.
Another important parameter is μhop which helps in determining the conducting capacity of organic oligomers. For a better conducting capacity of the oligomers, the value of μhop should be high which in turn indicates a greater electronic coupling between the adjacent molecules. The calculated μhop values for holes (μhop+) and electrons (μhop−) are reported in Table 9. From this table it is evident that compound PDI-BDT-4 possesses the highest value of μhop+ and PDI-BTAC-4 possesses the highest value of μhop−. These values are in accordance with the observed values of kCT+ and kCT− of these compounds, respectively. Hence, our designed compounds are potential candidates for application in optoelectronic devices.

EDD maps are evaluated to gain insight into the type of charge separation that occurs due to electronic excitation of compounds. We have performed a systematic analysis of the electronic structures and obtained the EDD maps for the studied monomers using the Multiwfn package. The obtained EDD maps for monomer compounds PDI-DTT-4, PDI-DTT-5, PDI-EDOT-4 and PDI-EDOT-5 are presented in Fig. 9 and those for the other compounds are presented in Fig. S6 (ESI). In Fig. 9 and Fig. S6 (ESI), the green region represents the increase in electron density and the blue region represents the decrease in electron density due to excitation of electrons.

From Fig. 9 and Fig. S6 (ESI) it is confirmed that the charge transfer occurs from the donor to the acceptor unit via the π-bridging unit in the case of all the studied compounds. Thus, the above implication manifests that the donor unit exhibits the minimum electron density, while the acceptor unit exhibits the maximum electron density in all the studied compounds.

In order to gain insight into the electronic properties of the PDI-based compounds, the vertical excitation properties have been obtained for 30 excited states with the TD-DFT method at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The dominant electronic transitions, λmax, excitation energy (Eg), fosc, TD-DFT configuration, orbital contributions and ηλ values of the studied dimers are reported in Table 10 for the gas phase and in Table S4 (ESI) for the solvent (chloroform) phase. The spectral absorption properties of the studied monomers for the gas phase are also provided in Table S5 (ESI).

From Table 10, it can be observed that the PDI-BITHN groups of compounds possess comparatively higher λmax values and lower Eg values among all the studied compounds. In this regard, compounds PDI-BITHN-3 and PDI-BITHN-4 possess higher values of λmax (i.e., 653 nm and 648 nm, respectively) which are in accordance with their lower Eg values. The presence of the FN and ACE π-bridging units causes a maximum red-shift in these compounds. However, the PDI-BTAC groups of compounds possess comparatively lower λmax values and higher Eg values among all the studied compounds. In this regard, compound PDI-BTAC-4 possesses the lowest λmax (453 nm) and highest Eg values which causes a blue-shift in this compound. These observed facts reveal that the BITHN donor unit along with different π-bridging units shift the absorption wavelength of the compounds toward the longer wavelength region. On the other hand, the BTAC donor unit along with different π-bridging units shifts the absorption wavelength towards the shorter wavelength region. Moreover, comparison between Tables 10 and 6 provides a correlation between the Eg values and ΔH–L values. It is observed that the PDI-BITHN groups of compounds possess comparatively lower ΔH–L values, and consequently the Eg values for these compounds are also minimum. The plots of the absorption spectra of the PDI-BITHN and PDI-BTAC groups of dimers are provided in Fig. 10 and those for the other groups of dimers are provided in Fig. S7 (ESI).

NTO analysis is performed to find out the population of the dominant electronic transitions. It provides a more innate picture of the orbitals (whether mixed or not) involved in hole–particle transitions. We have calculated the largest NTO eigenvalues for the studied dimers for their crucial transitions by employing the TD-DFT method and the same are provided in Table 10. The visualization of the hole and particle NTOs of compounds PDI-DTT-3, PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-3 and PDI-EDOT-4 is provided in Fig. 11. In this figure, the particle and hole transition orbitals represent the occupied and unoccupied orbitals, respectively. Besides, the NTO eigenvalue, λNTO, represents the fraction of hole–particle pair contribution to the particular electronic transition. From the hole and particle NTOs presented in Fig. 11, it can be observed that the electron density is transferred from the donor to the acceptor unit via the π-bridging unit after electronic transitions.



E
B is the energy difference between a bound electron–hole pair, i.e., an exciton, on one molecular unit and a free electron and hole on different units. It is mainly used to measure the strength of the electron–hole interaction in an exciton. It can be described as EB = ΔH–L − E1, where E1 indicates the optical band gap, i.e., the energy required for the Sg → S1 transition. For an organic semiconductor, the EB value should lie in the range of 0.2 eV to 1 eV, as has already been reported. Besides, a favorable dissociation of an exciton into free charges is facilitated by a lower value of EB. The respective values of ΔH–L, E1, and EB of the studied monomer compounds are reported in Table 11. From this table it can be observed that the EB values are within the reported range for all the studied compounds. This indicates that the exciton dissociation into free charges is favorable in all the studied compounds.

The ground state electron of the donor molecule gets excited upon irradiation of light of a suitable wavelength. At this point, the electron–hole pair dissociates into free charges, which further spread into the acceptor at the D/A interface. A spontaneous transfer of this excited electron to the acceptor occurs, when the ΔG value becomes negative. At the same time, the electron and hole will be collected at the respective electrodes. The Rehm–Weller equation can be used to determine the ΔG value as follows:
ΔG = IP(D) − EA(A) − E1 − EB,

D) and EA(A) represent the ionization potential of the donor and electron affinity of the acceptor, which are considered to be the negative values of the HOMO and LUMO energies of the donor and acceptor, respectively. The calculated values of ΔG are reported in Table 11. From this table, the obtained values of ΔG are found to be negative. This implies the occurrence of spontaneous transfer of excited electrons from the donor to the acceptor molecule.


In OSCs, proper arrangement of the D/A blends plays an essential role in converting light into electricity. From the observed λ and kCT values (mentioned in Table 9), it is evident that, among the studied monomer compounds, PDI-DTT-4, PDI-EDOT-4, PDI-BDT-3, PDI-BDT-4, PDI-BTAC-1, PDI-BTAC-2, PDI-BTAC-3 and PDI-BTAC-4 are primarily hole transporting in nature. On the other hand, the remaining studied compounds are electron transporting in nature. In this regard, we have arranged the standard donor (KM-10) and the standard acceptor (C60-CN) with our designed small acceptors and donors, respectively, in a face-to-face manner to meet the conditions for large intermolecular electronic coupling. Initially, the distance between the center of the donor and acceptor has been fixed to 3.5 Å. We have carried out the geometry optimization of the designed D/A complexes at the B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) level of theory and studied their absorption properties at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The optimized structures of the designed D/A complexes are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI). The spectral absorption data of the studied D/A complexes are provided in Table 12 and their corresponding absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 12.

On comparing Table 12 with Table S5 (ESI), it has been observed that all the designed D/A complexes exhibit a red-shift compared to our designed isolated donor and acceptor compounds. This implies that the absorption properties of the isolated donor and acceptor compounds have greatly affected the absorption properties of the D/A complexes. Moreover, it has been observed that the KM-10/acceptor and donor/C60-CN complexes undergo a comparative red-shift than the standard donor (KM-10 with λmax = 536.30 nm) and acceptor (C60-CN with λmax = 519.16 nm) molecules. In all complexes, the fosc values are also observed to be very close to zero. In the case of all the designed D/A complexes, the dominant transitions are H → L in nature.

To estimate the photovoltaic performance we have calculated the values of Jsc, eVoc, νoc, FF and η of the studied D/A complexes. The obtained results are reported in Table 13.

From Table 13, the Jsc values of all the D/A complexes show an increasing trend with a decrease in their Eg values (as reported in Table 12). Moreover, among the studied complexes, the Jsc values are observed to be the highest for complex KM-10/PDI-BITHN-4 (21.36 mA cm−2) and the lowest for complex PDI-BDT-4/C60-CN (7.59 mA cm−2). From Table 13, the theoretical PCE value is also observed to be the highest for complex KM-10/PDI-BITHN-4 (19.26%) which is in accordance with the observed highest Jsc value. On the other hand, the theoretical PCE value is observed to be the lowest (3.28%) for complex PDI-BTAC-2/C60-CN. Thus, from the above analysis it can be inferred that all the studied complexes have the potential to become excellent candidates for fabrication of OPVs. Besides, complex KM-10/PDI-BITHN-4 with a theoretical PCE of 19.26% can be chosen as the most suitable candidate for application in OSCs.

In this paper, we have designed a series of D–π–A type oligomers and investigated their structural and electronic properties by incorporating PDI as the acceptor unit. Firstly, we have designed some efficient PDI based oligomers following the D–π–A architecture to fabricate optoelectronic materials. To achieve this, the PDI acceptor unit has been substituted at the ortho position (instead of the bay position) of the perylene core to improve the performance of the devices and maintain the planarity of the perylene π-plane. Secondly, we have tried to tune their electronic properties via molecular engineering. Additionally, we have studied the absorption and photovoltaic properties of the designed D/A complexes to observe the electron injection process from the donor to the acceptor molecules. From the structural and electronic properties of the designed compounds, we have observed that substitution by different donor and π-bridging units affects these properties in diverse ways. Besides, the MEPS contour plots provide significant charge transfer characteristics of the studied compounds. The EDD maps of the studied compounds also confirm that the Sg → S1 transition involves greater charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit via the π-bridging unit. Further, the spectral absorption properties of the studied compounds reveal that the PDI-BITHN groups of compounds possess comparatively higher λmax values and lower Eg values in both phases. It has been observed that the BITHN donor unit along with different π-bridging units results in a red-shift of the absorption wavelengths. Moreover, the NTO analysis provides a more intuitive picture of the orbitals involved in hole–particle excitation. From the photovoltaic characteristics of the designed D/A complexes, it can be revealed that our designed complexes have the potential to serve as OPVs. Besides, complex KM-10/PDI-BITHN-4 with the highest values of Jsc (21.36 mA cm−2) and theoretical PCE (19.26%) can be considered as the most promising candidate for improving the efficiency of OSCs.

In short, we can conclude that substitution of different donor and π-bridging units at the ortho position of the perylene core of the PDI acceptor unit favors better tuning of the optoelectronic properties of the designed D/A complexes. Moreover, our study provides recommendations for designing potential D/A complexes to fulfill the requirements of OSC applications.
