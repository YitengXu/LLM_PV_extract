The low conductivity and catalytic activity of counter electrode (CE) materials in the electrolyte of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has resulted in unprecedented challenges, limiting their development. Herein, a highly efficient CE material was synthesized by uniformly distributing transition metal selenides in a metal–organic framework (MOF, denoted as CoSe2@NC), and then integrating carbon nanotubes, which were finally designed as integrated interconnected nanoreactors (CoSe2@NC-CNTs). Consequently, DSSC with three-dimensional (3D) reticular CoSe2@NC-CNT CE displayed a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.25%, exceeding that of Pt CE (7.81%). This outstanding performance is attributed to: (1) the increased specific surface area, which promotes the absorption of the dye and electrolyte, (2) the metal-on-MOF hierarchical structure as a unique crystalline porous material, which optimizes the efficiency of the metal nanoparticles, (3) the doping of heteroatom (N), which provides more defect sites and enhances the catalytic activity, and (4) the porous walls of MOF and internal connected CNTs, which provide sufficient pathways for the fast diffusion of electrons and iodine ions. The present work not only strengthens the understanding of the coupling interaction between porous CoSe2@NC and CNTs, but also offers an extended strategy of structuring further well-defined metal-on-MOF hybrids.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) represent promising photovoltaic devices to supply solar energy because of their inexpensive raw materials, convenient assembly, and environment friendliness. A typical DSSC device consists of a dye-absorbed photoanode, a counter electrode (CE) and an iodine ion-containing electrolyte. The optimization of all these components is the key for achieving favorable performances in DSSCs. CE plays the role of catalyzing the redox reaction of I3−/I− ion pairs. Traditionally, the material used as the CE is platinum (Pt). However, Pt is scarce and expensive, restricting its large-scale application. Therefore, the development of high-performance and cost-effective materials with long-term stability, especially based on Pt-free CE materials, is of great significance for the practical application of DSSCs.

With the rapid increase of research in this area, carbon materials, transition metal compounds, and their corresponding hybrids have proven to be substitutes for Pt CE in DSSCs. Specifically, transition metal selenides, such as NbSe2, NiSe2, and ZnSe2 have been studied, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.7%, 7.34%, and 8.69% achieved, respectively. Comparatively, cobalt selenide (CoSe2) has attracted considerable attention due to its high catalytic activity, low cost and excellent long-term stability. Previously, Wang et al. reported that the synergistic effect between CoSe2 (CoS2) and N-doped carbon achieved a PCE of 9.06%. Dong et al. indicated that the morphology optimization of CoSe2 can facilitate the electron transfer and obtained a PCE of 8.38%. Huang et al. demonstrated that CoS2–CoSe2 heterojunctions coupled with N-doped carbon and the porous structure of nanocubes achieved a PCE of 8.45%. The related parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI). However, the photovoltaic performance of the CoSe2 CE in DSSCs is limited by its poor electrical conductivity, which results from its semi-conductive property. Generally, it is difficult for a single material to possess the high conductivity and catalytic activity required for efficient operation simultaneously. However, carbon materials possess excellent electron transfer ability, and thus covering or interleaving carbon materials with CoSe2 has been regarded as a potential strategy to remedy this defect. Additionally, when the catalytic properties of the CE cannot maintain the required current, an effective strategy proposed to improve the effective exchange current is increasing the surface area of the CE. As a classic type of Co-substituted metal–organic framework (MOF), zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) possesses the advantages of high surface area, uniform distribution of metal ions (Co), and presence of heteroatoms (N). This indicates that ZIF-67 is an ideal carrier for multifunctional nanomaterials. To date, although some promising results have been achieved in the relevant studies, it is still a significant challenge to achieve multi-component efficient synergy to improve the catalytic performance in DSSCs.
Accordingly, herein, a novel strategy combining self-assembly growth and selenidation was developed for the synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D) CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid. Firstly, the ZIF-67-CNT precursor was obtained via the self-assembly growth of ZIF-67 rhomboid dodecahedrons on interspersed CNTs, and subsequently direct selenidation via pyrolysis with Se powder flow to form the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid. Numerous tests were performed for the in-depth analysis of the enhancement in catalytic activity and electronic transfer capacity after doping CNTs into CoSe2@NC. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that the structural advantage of the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid contributed to the uniform dispersion of the metal particles and exposed abundant catalytic active sites in the limited surface area. The electrochemical analysis combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement indicate that the introduction of N can offer additional defects to further enhance the catalytic performance. Therefore, the DSSC with the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE = 9.25%). This work presents further opportunities for achieving low-cost DSSCs. Meanwhile the internal-connected CNTs between the CoSe2@NC polyhedrons built a bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, AR), 2-methylimidazole (C4H6N2, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, ≥ 98.0%), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, K30), multiwall CNTs (diameter: 25–50 nm and length: 10–20 μm), selenium powder (Se, Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, ≥99.0%), and polyethylene glycol 20000 (Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, ≥99.0%). All chemicals were used as received without further purification.


Typically, 1 g pristine CNTs were refluxed in a mixture of 60 mL nitric acid and 20 mL sulfuric acid. The mixture was stirred in a water bath at 80 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, the acid-treated CNTs were cooled to room temperature and washed with ethanol and deionized water several times until neutral pH and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h.


In a typical synthesis, 70 mg of as-pretreated CNTs and 300 mg of PVP were added to 50 mL methanol. After ultrasonic treatment for 3 h, the mixture solution was dispersed uniformly. Subsequently, 1.164 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O was added at room temperature. A black solution was obtained. Meanwhile, 1.53 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 50 mL methanol to form a clear solution. This clear solution was quickly transferred into the above black solution with magnetic stirring. The obtained solution was stirred for another 4 h. Next, this solution was aged at room temperature for 20 h. The purple precipitates were collected through centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and finally dried at 70 °C for 12 h. For comparison, ZIF-67 polyhedrons without CNTs were also prepared via the same procedure.

For the synthesis of the acid-treated ZIF-67, 0.2 g ZIF-67 was heated to 520 °C at the rate of 2 °C min−1 under an N2 environment and kept at the same temperature for 30 min. Then the black sample was dissolved in 0.2 mM hydrochloric acid solution and stirred for 24 h. After washing with deionized water and ethanol for at least 6 times, the sample was dried at 60 °C for 8 h.

A quartz boat loaded with 0.2 g ZIF-67-CNTs was placed in the middle of a quartz tube furnace. Another quartz boat with 1.6 g selenium powder was put in the intake port of the quartz tube furnace. Then, the furnace was heated to 520 °C at the rate of 2 °C min−1 under an N2 environment and kept at the same temperature for 30 min. The black CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid powder was obtained after the tube furnace was naturally cooled to ambient temperature. For comparison, CoSe2@NC without CNTs was synthesized using a similar method with ZIF-67 as the precursor.


The crystalline structure of the obtained samples was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu-Kα radiation, k = 1.5406 Å) at 36 kV and 25 mA. The chemical composition and valence states of these samples were measured via X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (ESCALAB 250Xi). The Raman spectra of the samples were measured using a confocal laser micro Raman spectrometer.

The morphology and size of the sample were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electronic microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, Hitachi, Japan). The BET specific surface of the sample, pore volume and pore size distribution were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (ASAP2020M + C, Micromeritics, America).

The electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel curves were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUMCIMPS-1, Germany) with a conventional three-electrode system.


The CEs of ZIF-67, acid-treated ZIF-67 and CoSe2@NC CEs were prepared via a facile doctor-blade method. In a typical preparation process for the CEs, FTO glass was sufficiently cleaned with deionized water and ethanol to remove the impurities. Then the glass was cut into 1.0 cm × 2.0 cm pieces and taped with a 0.5 cm gap. Then 40 mg of the prepared catalyst and 10 mg polyethylene glycol 20000 (PEG 20000) were mixed in the same mortar, and about 30 mL ethanol was added to the mixture gradually with constant grinding until a well-distributed and viscous solution was formed. Then the solution was transferred to the FTO glass and a uniform thin film was formed via the doctor-blade technique. The coated FTO glass was heated in a quartz tube furnace at 400 °C under an argon gas flow to obtain the final counter electrode.


The ZIF-67-CNT, CoSe2@NC-CNT and CNT CEs were prepared using the above-mentioned doctor-blade method. However, it is important to note that the introduction of PVP and CNTs in the synthesis process was instrumental for the ZIF-67-based materials to adhere to the FTO substrate.


A “sandwich”-structured DSSC device was fabricated, which consisted of a counter electrode, electrolyte and dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode. The commercial photoanodes (Dalian HeptaChroma Solar Tech Co, Ltd) were soaked in N719 (Dalian HeptaChroma Solar Tech Co, Ltd) dye solution for 20 h. The PCE of the CEs were measured on a xenon light simulator under an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G using a digital source meter (Keithley 2410) at the room temperature.


A schematic of the formation process of the CoSe2@NC-CNT nanohybrid architecture is shown in Fig. 1a. Firstly, because of the electrostatic interaction, a few metal Co2+ ions adhered to the carboxylic sites of the acidified CNT surface. Secondly, after 2-methylimidazole was added, heterogeneous crystal nucleation occurred on the surface of the CNTs, and ZIF-67 polyhedrons uniformly evolved on the CNTs with the self-assembly stages of Co2+ ions and the ligands from 2-methylimidazole. Thus, a promising 3D meshwork architecture was gradually formed. Finally, thermal selenization treatment under an N2 environment in selenic flow was applied to generate the CoSe2@NC-CNT nanohybrid. The schematic diagram of the hypothetical structure displays that the core–shell structure, the internally connected CNTs and the CoSe2 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the walls of the MOF. Meanwhile, Fig. S1 (see the ESI) demonstrates the typical DSSC assembly process.

The morphology and internal structure of the ZIF-67-CNT, CoSe2@NC, and CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The low-amplification SEM image of ZIF-67-CNTs is presented in Fig. S2a (ESI), where the 3D meshwork architecture clearly consists of penetrating CNTs and ZIF-67 polyhedrons, while the high-magnification SEM image (Fig. S2b, ESI) reflects the smooth surface of the precursors with a diameter of about 500 nm. Moreover, the typical SEM images of CoSe2@NC-CNTs and CoSe2@NC are illustrated in Fig. S2c–f (ESI). As shown in Fig. S2d and f (ESI), the surface of the CoSe2@NC polyhedrons is rough and the boundary area possess some dots. Meanwhile, TEM images were further obtained to verify the microstructure evolution in the samples. Fig. 1b displays the solid internal structure and the internally connected CNTs of ZIF-67-CNTs, while Fig. 1c indicates the hierarchical polyhedral shell structure of the pure CoSe2@NC. Considering that the special nanomaterial combines CNTs and core-shelled polyhedrons, CoSe2@NC-CNTs (Fig. 1d) may be endowed with good electron transport ability and large specific surface area. In addition, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image selected from the surface of CoSe2@NC-CNTs is presented in Fig. 1e. The lattice spacing of 0.227 nm and 0.258 nm can be observed, corresponding to the (210) and (111) planes of CoSe2, respectively. To further confirm the surface composition of CoSe2@NC-CNTs, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image is displayed in Fig. 1f, where the diffraction rings are indexed to the (031), (210) and (111) crystal planes of CoSe2. The clear and correct corresponding relation between the lattice spacing and planes indicates the high crystallization of the obtained sample. Additionally, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping (Fig. 1g) and EDX spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI) were used to demonstrate the element distribution and proportion of C, N, Co, Se and O in CoSe2@NC-CNTs. The results reveal that the spatial localization elements of C, N, Co, Se, and O are uniformly distributed, and their atomic concentrations are 48.8%, 14.2%, 4.54%, 7.14%, and 15.38%, respectively. It can be concluded that the particular structure of the MOF can efficiently prevent the agglomeration of functional groups and metal clusters.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to characterize the crystal pattern and phase purity of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 2a, the positions of the main peaks of the products match well with the standard XRD patterns. The diffraction peaks are all attributed to the CoSe2 phase, according to the standard JCPDS Card, File No. 53-0449. The typical diffraction peaks are located at the 2θ values of 30.8°, 34.5°, 36.0°, 47.7°, 50.2°, and 62.9°, which correspond to the (101), (111), (120), (211), (002), and (301) crystal planes of CoSe2, respectively. The minor peaks at 23.8°, 28.9°, 40.4°, 44.0°, 53.5°, 57.0°, and 59.3° are attributed to the (110), (011), (210), (121), (031), (131), and (310) facets, respectively. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks of the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid are identical with the CoSe2 peaks except for the intensity of the peak at 26.6°, which can be ascribed to the (004) lattice plane of the CNTs. The results revealed the absence of extra diffraction peaks. Therefore, all the samples have high purity, further confirming that the CoSe2@NC and CNT composites have a well-created structure.
To understand the elemental components of the CoSe2@NC, CNTs and CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid, their Raman spectra were measured, as depicted in Fig. 2b. Notably, the Raman characteristic peaks of the D and G bands exist clearly in the spectrum of the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid, which are located at 1342 cm−1 and 1595 cm−1, respectively. The D band is related to both the structural defects and disorder of amorphous carbon, while the G band refers to the vibration of sp2-bonded C atoms in the CNTs. The different D and G peak intensities for CoSe2@NC, CNTs, and CoSe2@NC-CNTs hybrid is ascribed to the electron transfer between the CoSe2@NC polyhedrons and CNT frame. More importantly, the D/G intensity ratio was determined to evaluate the defect density and number of active sites. The intensity ratio for the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid (ID/IG = 0.998), CoSe2@NC (ID/IG = 0.913), and CNTs (ID/IG = 0.678) confirms that the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid possess the most structural defects. The additional structural defects may be beneficial to increase the contact area between the electrode with dye and electrolyte, which will further promote the oxidation–reduction process of iodide ions.
The elemental valence states and chemical composition of the as-prepared CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid were investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. The full-survey scan XPS spectrum of CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid is exhibited in Fig. S4a (ESI), revealing the presence of Co, Se, C, N and O elements. The key peaks for the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid are 780 eV (Co 2p), 532 eV (O 1s), 399 eV (N 1s), 285 eV (C 1s), and 55 eV (Se 3d). Given that no interfering peaks are available, the survey spectra effectively confirm the successful formation of the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid. In the C 1s spectrum (Fig. S4b, ESI), the peak at 284.7 eV is attributed to the C–C bonds of the CNTs or the indefinite element carbon, and the peaks at 285.5 eV and 288.1 eV can be assigned to the C–N and CO bonds, respectively. In the N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c), the peaks located at 398.7 eV, 398.8 eV and 399.3 eV correspond to graphitic-N, pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N. In addition, a schematic illustration of the N-bonding configurations is presented in Fig. S4c (ESI), where the nitrogen from the pyrolysis of 2-MIM doped on the surface of the CNTs and walls of CoSe2@NC can enhance the surface wettability of the electrode material, thus improving their synergistic effect in the reduction reaction. Therefore, nitrogen doping in porous carbon materials can serve as a promising method for the preparation of electrode materials for DSSCs. In the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 2d), the three peaks located at 797.4 eV, 779.8 eV and 781.5 eV correspond to the Co 2p1/2, Co 2p3/2 of Co2+, and Co 2p3/2 of Co3+ species, respectively. The presence of Co3+ should be ascribed to slight surface oxidation. Similarly, in Fig. 2e, the two peaks at the binding energies of 54.6 eV and 55.8 eV correspond to the Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 spin–orbit peaks, respectively. It should be noted that the characteristic peak of Co 2p3/2 at 780.4 eV was negatively shifted to 779.8 eV and Se 3d3/2 at 55.4 eV was positively shifted to 55.8 eV. This indicates that the electron transfer occurs between the Co and Se elements, implying that the Se presented partial positive charges (δ+) and Co possessed partial negative charges (δ−) in the CoSe2-CNT hybrid.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to study the specific surface area of the CoSe2@NC, CNTs, and CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid (Fig. 2f). The calculated BET surface area of the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid is about 101.17 m2 g−1, which is larger than that of CoSe2@NC (67.84 m2 g−1) and CNTs (94.41 m2 g−1), respectively. Additionally, the pore size distribution of the given samples is shown in the inset of the same graph (Fig. 2f), which was determined according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The BJH absorption average pore diameter of the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid is 169.850 Å, which is larger than that of CoSe2@NC of 159.795 Å and superior to that of the CNTs (90.247 Å). The enhancement in the BET specific surface area of CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid was caused by the coupling effect, which is beneficial for the promotion of the contact area at the interface of the electrolyte and the electrode. The large BJH adsorption average pore diameter can reduce the diffusion distance and further promote the electron transport kinetics. Thus, it can be seen that the above-mentioned two advantages will lead to enhanced electrochemical performances.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to detect the thermal stability and thermal decomposition of the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI), a two-stage weight loss occurred during the heating process with the experimental conditions of N2, heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and temperature of 800 °C finally. In the first stage, a significant decrease began at 350 °C with a weight loss of 10.4%, suggesting the organic ligands were carbonized to form H2O and CO2. The second obvious weight loss occurred during the second stage of with a total percentage of 21.9% equals 10.4% + 11.5%. The main reason for this is that the oxidative degradation of the CNTs.

To check the photovoltaic properties of the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE in a DSSC, the incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) plots were measured to assess the various CEs. The conceptual diagram of the DSSC assembled with the CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid CE is depicted in Fig. 3a.


The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured for the as-prepared samples to reveal the photoelectric responses. Generally, the IPCE is a significant indicator of the ratio between the number of electrons produced in the external circuit and the photon number to incident monochromatic light within the same period. The curves and values of the solar cell fabricated with the CoSe2@NC, CNT, CoSe2@NC-CNT and Pt electrodes are displayed in Fig. 3b and c. The wavelength of the IPCE spectra ranges from 450 to 700 nm, where it can be easily found that the DSSC with the CoSe2@NC-CNT electrode achieved the highest photoresponse (70.2%), which is much larger than that of CoSe2@NC (66.4%), CNTs (44.8%) and Pt (61.2%). This can be attributed to the coupling of the CoSe2@NC and CNTs.


The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the as-prepared samples are presented in Fig. 3d, which can be further used to assess the photovoltaic performances of the DSSC. It is rational to investigate catalytic performance with four corresponding paraments, namely short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The estimated PCE values are displayed in Fig. 3e, and the corresponding above-mentioned paraments are listed in Table 1. Notably, the DSSC with the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE demonstrated an excellent PCE (9.25%), which is higher than that of CoSe2@NC (8.74%) and Pt (7.81%). Meanwhile, the J–V curves of the acid-treated ZIF-67, ZIF-67, and ZIF-67-CNTs are exhibited in Fig. S6a and the paraments are summarized in Table S2 (ESI). The results indicate that these product-loaded CEs achieved PCE values of 2.93%, 4.19%, and 5.00%, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 3f, the trend of the FF, Voc, Jsc and PCE values is positive. The gradually increasing Jsc values of the aforementioned CEs represent the increased conductivity to support electron transfer, improving the electrocatalytic activity of I3−/I−. The enhancement in the FF is mainly ascribed to the decrease in the series resistance, charge transfer resistance between the CE/electrolyte interface and diffusion resistance of I3− in the electrolyte. In addition, the greater Voc is attributed to the richer interfacial active sites, which is conducive to an improvement in photovoltaic performance. In contrast, the enhancement in PCE can be ascribed to the carbon materials, which have a high electron transfer rate and expand the contact area between the electrolyte and electrode. A conceptual diagram of the incremental transport capacity of electrons and iodine ions is vividly depicted in Fig. 3g. Furthermore, the fine structural evolution of the acid-treated ZIF-67, ZIF-67, ZIF-67-CNTs, CoSe2@NC and CoSe2@NC-CNTs is summarized. The gradually improved photoelectric conversion performance also can be ascribed to the uniformly distributed metal ions (CoSe2) and functional groups (N), which can improve the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte. Therefore, the mesoporous structure of the MOF and the bridge structure of CoSe2@NC-CNT hybrid can provide high-speed electron transfer channels and abundant active catalytic sites to improve its electrocatalytic activity.

A schematic illustration of the EIS and Tafel tests is shown in Fig. 4a. Because of the positive relationship between the electrochemical performance and photocurrent generation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel polarization and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to investigate the electrocatalytic activities of the different CEs.


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was used to investigate the charge transfer process between the electrode and electrolyte in the DSSCs. The Nyquist plots of the CoSe2@NC, CNT, CoSe2@NC-CNT and Pt CE are depicted in Fig. 4b. For comparison, the Nyquist plots of the acid-treated ZIF-67, ZIF-67, and ZIF-67-CNTs are exhibited in Fig. S6b (ESI). Generally, an ideal impedance spectrum has two similar semicircles. The first semicircle spacing in the high-frequency region is named Rct, representing the impedance of the charge-transfer process between the electrode and electrolyte. The other semicircle gap is the value of ZN, which signifies the Nernst diffusion resistance of iodide ions in the electrolyte. The high frequency intercept on the real axis is equal to the Rs and CPE value, reflecting the double-layer chemical capacitance. As listed in Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI), the Rct of the CEs followed the order of a-CoSe2@NC-CNTs (0.06 Ω·cm2) < CoSe2@NC (0.19 Ω·cm2) < ZIF-67-CNTs (0.31 Ω·cm2) < ZIF-67 (0.79 Ω·cm2) < acid-treated ZIF-67 (2.46 Ω·cm2). Importantly, the Rct value of the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE is the lowest among the investigated materials, which can expedite the charge transfer and enhance the area of the CE for electrocatalysis. Moreover, compared with the other CEs without CNT coupling, the small Rct value also indicates the reduced energy loss between the interface of the electrolyte and CE. Therefore, the bridge structure of CoSe2@NC-CNTs may contribute to electron transfer. Meanwhile, heteroatom N doping also improves the hydrophilicity and conductivity of the electrode surface, promoting the interaction and transfer in the electrolyte.

The Tafel polarization curves are presented in Fig. 4c and Fig. S6c (ESI). Generally, the Tafel curves of the different CEs represent the logarithmic current density as a function of the potential. Generally, the catalytic activity of the CEs for the reduction of triiodide was evaluated via the diffusion area and Tafel region. The crossover points of the cathodic branch and tangents with the ordinate represent the exchange current density (J0) and limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), respectively. The J0 is oppositely proportioned to the above-mentioned charge-transfer resistance (Rct), signifying the catalytic activity of the CE materials. Jlim exhibits a positive linear relationship with the diffusion coefficient (D), which can reflect the diffusion rate of I3−. These are important parameters that are related to the conversion efficiency in the cells, where higher J0 and Jlim values indicate better catalytic activity. The related J0 and Jlim values are listed in Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI). The as-prepared samples followed the order of a-CoSe2@NC-CNTs> CoSe2@NC> ZIF-67-CNTs> ZIF-67> acid-treated ZIF-67. This specific relationship can be understood by eqn (1) and (2) as follows:

(2)
where
R, T, n, F, and C represent the gas constant, thermodynamic temperature, diffusion coefficient of triiodide, Faraday constant and concentration of I3− in the electrolyte, respectively. The highest Jlim of the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE means that it possesses superior ability for the diffusion of the I3−/I− redox pair. Therefore, the porous walls of the MOF and internal connected CNTs provide sufficient pathways for the fast diffusion of electrons and iodine ions. This is also well consistent with the other EIS test results.


To further explore the catalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was implemented with a three-electrode system at the scanning rate of 25 mV s−1. In general, the counter electrode is used as the working electrode (WE), a calomel immersed electrode is used as the reference electrode (RE), and Pt is used as the auxiliary electrode (AE). The CV curves of the different CEs are illustrated in Fig. 4d and Fig. S6d (ESI). It is worth noting that all the CV curves consist of two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks, i.e., Ox1/Red1 and Ox2/Red2. Generally, the oxidation (OX1) and reduction (Red1) peaks on the left side of the curve, which correspond to the oxidation–reduction of I3−/I−, are important parameters for evaluating the catalytic reactions. The oxidation (OX2) and reduction (Red2) peaks on the right side of the curve are associated with the oxidation–reduction of I3−/I2. The coupled peaks Ox1/Red1 and Ox2/Red2 can be disclosed by the eqn (3) and (4), respectively.

There are two important parameters, the peak-to-peak separation (Epp) and the peak current density of OX1 and Red1, which can be used evaluate the catalytic activity and electrochemical performance. Typically, a higher cathodic peak current density (Jpc) value indicates the better reduction ability of I3− for the equipped electrodes. The lower gap between the peaks (Epp) of Ox1 and Red1 implies faster reaction kinetics. As presented in Table 2 and Table S3 (ESI), the tuned CoSe2@NC-CNTs possesses a higher Jpc value and lower Epp (0.27 V), which are superior to that of CoSe2@NC (0.30 V), ZIF-67-CNTs (0.37 V), ZIF-67 (0.39 V), and acid-treated ZIF-67 (>0.70 V), indicating that the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE possesses satisfactory catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− under the same experimental conditions.
Meanwhile, the CV curves of the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE at different scanning rates (Fig. 4e) of 10, 30, 50, 70 and 100 mV s−1 were measured to detect the relationship between peak current density and the scanning rate. The results indicate that the reactions on the electrode were limited by the migration of iodine to the CE, which is due to the diffusion layer becoming smaller and the electrochemical polarization increasing. In addition, as displayed in Fig. 4f, with an increase in the scanning speed, it is clear that the square root of the scanning rate and peak current density of the oxidation/reduction peaks demonstrate a distinct linear relationship. This indicates that only the limited diffusion of electrons occurs at the interface between the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE and I−/I3− redox, instead of other additional chemical reactions occurring.

The electrochemical stability is another worthy parameter that generally affects the application of CEs in DSSCs. Thus, to verify the stability of the CoSe2@NC, CoSe2@NC-CNT, Pt and CNT CEs, 20 cyclic CV tests were carried out at the same scanning speed of 25 mV s−1. The noticeable deviation in the oxidation/reduction peaks indicates the low stability of the CoSe2@NC CE (Fig. 5a). It can be found that the redox peaks decreased gradually in the oxidation/reduction process with an increase in the recycle times, which can be explained by the fact that the active substance was completely exposed to the corrosive electrolyte, which gradually destroyed the structure and reduced the catalytic activity of the CE. However, the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE (Fig. 5b) demonstrated outstanding stability compared with the Pt and CNTs, as shown in Fig. S7a and b (ESI). The corresponding specific change in Epp is compared to the respective embedded graph also. This great improvement in stabilization can be ascribed to the coupling between the CNTs and CoSe2@NC polyhedrons, which could reduce the corrosion of the CE by the electrolyte.

Moreover, the CoSe2@NC and CoSe2@NC-CNT CEs were tested for 5 times of continuous photocurrent density versus voltage investigation to evaluate the stability of their photoelectric performance. The test result showed that CoSe2@NC (Fig. 5c) exhibited an obvious decrease in PCE value from 8.74% to 7.91%, while CoSe2@NC-CNTs (Fig. 5d) exhibited a smaller decrease from 9.25% to 9.08%, and the corresponding specific changes in Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE are compared in Table 3. Simply, the doping of heteroatoms can increase the CNT interface, and the conjugation length can be shortened due to the electrocatalytic center formed (N atoms). Thus, the introduction of carbon nanotubes can effectively improve the conductivity of materials, thereby accelerating the charge point process and charge transfer kinetics between the electrode and electrolyte. The construction of a carbon nanotube network can further improve the recovery ability of the DSSC, optimizing the stability of its long-term operation.

In summary, we demonstrated that the novel 3D CoSe2@NC-CNT meshwork architecture helped a dye-sensitized solar cell achieve a superior photoelectric performance. Due to the fine network structure of CoSe2@NC-CNTs, its active sites and specific surface area were enhanced, promoting the absorption of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the heteroatom-doped carbon layers of the CoSe2@NC nanoreactors and interconnected CNTs effectively accelerated the transmission of electrons and the diffusion of I− ions. In addition, the CoSe2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the MOF, which could provide self-protection to suppress their agglomeration. Consequently, the DSSC equipped with the CoSe2@NC-CNT CE displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity with a superior PCE value of 9.25%. This strategy not only reveals the chemical coupling interaction in the CoSe2@NC-CNT nanocomposite, but also provides ideas for the construction of other fine transition metal selenide and carbon nanotube hybrid systems, which has further application prospects in the field of catalysis and energy.
