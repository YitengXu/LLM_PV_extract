We have tested the photovoltaic metrics of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells over a wide temperature range from 80–360 K. Our investigation reveals that the open-circuit voltage reaches a maximum value at about 200 K close to the phase transition from tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase. The photocurrent is remarkably stable down to 240 K but drops precipitously upon approaching and below the phase transition temperature, implying inefficient charge carrier generation from the orthorhombic perovskite structure. The impedance spectroscopy measurement suggests ionic motion within the bulk of CH3NH3PbI3 after a phase transition. We propose a plausible mechanism for these phenomena and discuss implications for photovoltage generation and charge carrier transport in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells.

Photovoltaic devices based on thin film technologies are desirable to offer sustainable, renewable green energy with reduced materials and fabrication cost. In particular thin film solar cells fabricated by solution-processing based on semiconductor quantum dots, organic polymers, or dye-sensitized nanocrystals have received considerable attention, showing promising 7–13% solar to electric power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Recently, a new class of highly efficient solid-sate hybrid lead halide-based perovskite photovoltaics has emerged, achieving a certified PCE of 20.1%.

Hybrid lead halide perovskites such as methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) exhibit strong solar light harvesting via a direct optical transition extending to 800 nm, whose cross-section is an order of magnitude higher than that of typical ruthenium dyes. Apart from light absorption, another noteworthy feature of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3, CH3NH3+ being abbreviated as MA thereafter) is its ambipolar semiconducting properties enabling it to transport photo-generated electrons and holes to their respective collector electrodes. In this respect, hybrid lead methyl-ammonium triiodide based perovskite solar cells are different from dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that need a semi-conductive mesoporous scaffold to support the light harvester and collect the photo-generated electrons. By contrast perovskite solar cells can function without the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold. Likewise, perovskite solar cells without a hole transport material (HTM) system have shown substantial PCEs. However, information on the effect of temperature on the photovoltaic behaviour of the new perovskite solar cells is still lacking. Here we investigate the photovoltaic parameters of MAPbI3 solar cells from 360 K down to 80 K and propose a mechanism which accounts for our observations.

Fluorine-doped tin oxide (F:SnO2) coated glass (Pilkington TEC 15, 15 Ω per square) was patterned by etching with Zn powder and 2 M HCl diluted in Milli-Q water. The etched substrate was then cleaned with 2% hellmanex diluted in Milli-Q water, rinsed with Milli-Q water, and ethanol and dried with clean dry air. The substrate was kept in a UV-O3 chamber for 30 minutes prior to spray pyrolysis at 500 °C using 40 mL of a titanium di-isopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) solution (75% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (1:39, v/v) and oxygen as carrier gas, and sintered on a hot plate for 1 h at 500 °C. The TiO2 compact layer thickness determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was ∼30 nm. Porous TiO2 films of 200 nm thick were deposited onto compact layer covered substrates by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s using a TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30NRD, 30 nm average particle size) diluted in anhydrous ethanol (1:3, weight ratio). After drying at 80 °C, the TiO2 layers were heated to 470 °C for 15 min.

The mesoporous TiO2 films were infiltrated with PbI2 by spin-coating a PbI2 solution in DMF (462 mg mL−1) that was kept at 70 °C. After drying, the films were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I3 in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 30 s and rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. After drying, the CH3NH3PbI3-adsorbed films were covered with an HTM layer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s in a dry box. The HTM recipe was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spiro-bifluorene) (spiro-MeOTAD), 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, 65 nm of gold was thermally evaporated in the vacuum chamber on top of the device to form the electrode contacts. The device fabrication was carried out under controlled atmospheric conditions and a humidity of <1.0 ppm.

A solar simulator with a Xenon light source (450 W, Oriel, model 9119) and an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the solar cell. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the photocurrent generated under these conditions on a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (USA). The J–V curves were obtained in a reverse (from the VOC to the JSC) scan at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. A similar data-acquisition system was used to control the photon-to-current response (internal quantum efficiency, IQE) measurements. A white-light bias of 10% solar intensity was applied onto the sample during the IQE measurements, which employed monochromatic light modulated at 10 Hz. The temperature was controlled from 360 K down to 80 K within ±0.5 K by using a temperature controller (Oxford, optistat DN-TM). Impedance spectra (IS) were collected with an Autolab Frequency Analyzer setup consisting of the Autolab PGSTAT 30 (Eco Chemie B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands) and the Frequency Response Analyzer module. The measurements were performed at VOC in the frequency range 0.01 Hz–1 MHz with oscillation potential amplitudes of 30 mV. The CH3NH3PbI3 covered electrode was connected to the working electrode. The Au electrodes were connected to the auxiliary electrode and the reference electrode. The impedance measurements were carried out under open circuit potential (via tuning the bias light intensity with white LED light radiation). The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Z-view software (v2.8b, Scribner Associates Inc.). Low temperature differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a SDT 2010 thermal analyser swept at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from −170 °C to 0 °C under nitrogen and in the heating mode.



Fig. 1a presents a scheme of our cell configuration featuring a compact and nanocrystalline layer of TiO2 deposited on TCO coated glass infiltrated with MAPbI3 which is covered by spiro-MeOTAD and a gold back contact. Fig. 1b shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the fabricated device. Within the device structure one distinguishes the thin compact TiO2 layer on top of the FTO, followed by the mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold with a thickness of ∼200 nm. The latter was infiltrated with MAPbI3 using the previously described sequential deposition method. The mean TiO2 particle diameter was 30 nm with a porosity of 69% determined by BET. On top of the TiO2/MAPbI3 nanocomposite there is a MAPbI3 capping layer forming a smooth contact with the hole conductor. The spiro-MeOTAD layer exhibits a dense structure with a total thickness of 100 nm.

The photocurrent–voltage curve of the perovskite solar cell device measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G simulated irradiation at room temperature is shown in Fig. 2a. In order to reduce the influence from the direct adsorption of FTO glass and oxide semiconductors on the photovoltaic data, a sheet of YC-AR130 (an anti-reflecting UV cut-off film, Japan) was attached to each cell surface for J–V and IPCE measurements. The best device displayed a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 22.19 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.01 V, achieving a PCE of 16.1% for a reverse scan. The voltage scan rate in J–V measurements was kept at 20 mV per step with a delay time of 1 ms. The device showed a lower PCE of 12.4% when measured in a forward scan direction. We ascribe the large hysteretic behaviour to the CH3NH3PbI3 film with a small grain size of less than 150 nm by using the fabrication procedure as described in the experimental section. The small grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 would result in an increase of defect concentration which has been experimentally verified to be responsible for hysteretic behaviour. The hysteresis effect could be largely retarded in those devices using perovskite films with millimeter-scale crystalline grains formed by the hot-casting method of Nie et al. for instance. The IQE reaches a broad maximum at around 500 nm remaining at a level over 80% up to 750 nm (Fig. 2b). The appearance of plateau at such as high IQE level indicates that the MAPbI3 efficiently harvests visible light, converting it with near unit quantum yield to electric current.
We measured the photocurrent density vs. voltage (J–V) curves at different temperatures in the range between 80 and 360 K. The photovoltaic metrics derived from this analysis are summarized in Table 1. The VOC shows a maximum value of 1.15 V at about 200 K, indicating that a thermo-dynamic equilibrium state between charge recombination and generation is reached at this temperature. The JSC is remarkably stable down to 240 K but drops precipitously upon approaching and below the Curie temperature (∼160 K, Fig. S1), implying inefficient charge carrier extraction in the paraelectric and ferroelectric domain. The highest JSC obtained was 22.7 mA cm−2 at 280 K. The increase of photocurrent in the range of 200–300 K was accompanied by an augmentation of the fill factor compensating the decrease in the VOC. It is noted that the photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF) of the perovskite solar cells decrease largely as temperature being higher than 340 K, presumably due to an accelerated interfacial recombination among the charge selective contacts/MAPbI3. As a result, the overall power conversion efficiency reaches a maximum value of 16.1% at about 300 K. The mobility of electrons in the nanocrystalline TiO2 scaffold and that of holes in the spiro-MeOTAD increases with temperature since their transport involves thermally assisted carrier trapping and de-trapping and inter-molecular hopping, respectively. This improves the carrier collection efficiency resulting in the observed increase in JSC with temperature, which is a common feature for bulk heterojunction solar cells. However, the JSC and FF dropped to very small values below the phase transition temperature of 161 K where the MAPbI3 turns ferroelectric. For example, at 80 K, their respective JSC and FF values are 0.38 mA cm−2 and 0.18. A plot of the logarithm of JSC as a function of 1/T showed two different regimes with a break point at about 160 K (Fig. S1 in ESI) indicating a smaller activation energy for photocurrent generation in the orthorhombic (ferroelectric) MAPbI3 phase compared to the tetragonal one. The role of ferroelectric domain formation in inducing this distinct behaviour remains to be elucidated.

The temperature dependence of the VOC in the MAPbI3-based device deviates from the linear behaviour observed as a rule for organic and inorganic solar cells. Further insight into this unusual behaviour was gained by applying impedance spectroscopy (IS). The IS measurements were performed at open circuit under illumination with an LED array emitting white light at about 0.1 sun intensity. Fig. 3, S2 and S3 show the Nyquist plots for the perovskite solar cell at different temperatures. Three elements can be distinguished when the impedance measurement is performed at 300–360 K as shown in Fig. 3a. The first arc in the high frequency regime (100–600 kHz) is assigned to the charge exchange process at the spiro-MeOTAD/Au interface while the semicircle in the intermediate frequency region (50 Hz–100 kHz) corresponds to charge carrier recombination, i.e. interfacial recombination of the electrons in the TiO2 with holes in MAPbI3, or electrons in MAPbI3 with holes in spiro-MeOTAD. The charge carrier density and recombination rate determine the dark current and – along with the rate of photo-generation of carriers – the VOC. The feature at very low frequencies represents a process with long relaxation time and is so far still under discussion in the literature but has been attributed to a ferroelectric effect or an ionic movement inside the perovskite (see below the qualitative observation on the low frequency element).
As mentioned above the semicircle in the intermediate frequency region relates to the interfacial charge recombination which determines the device VOC. Therefore, we suggest using an equivalent circuit consistent with 3 lumped RC-circuits in series in Fig. S3 to fit the impedance data. R represents the interfacial charge transfer resistance, while C indicates the capacitance. Considering the device architecture, the second-arc in the middle frequency region for this device can be assigned to the charge recombination at the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface. Fig. S4 shows the interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rct) obtained from the curve fitting. As the temperature decreases from 360 K to 220 K, Rct increases first slowly then sharply. It shows the highest value at 200 K when the tetragonal phase is present. This is also reflected in the highest VOC (1.15 V) of the perovskite solar cell device at this temperature. Upon further lowering the temperature the interfacial charge recombination resistance shows a dip most probably related to the phase transition at 161 K before increasing further.
The charge recombination lifetime τ at different temperatures was determined by the formula τ = RctC (where Rct is the recombination resistance and C is the associated capacitance) and is presented in Fig. 4a as a function of temperature (or the inverse of the temperature). Clearly the recombination lifetime τ decreases with increasing temperature supporting our simplified approach for the impedance analysis. The logarithm of the recombination lifetime shows two different slopes with increasing temperature (Fig. 4a), which reflects the corresponding behaviour of the VOC in the same temperature range, from 80 to 120 K, and from 140 to 220 K (see Table 1). The reduced VOC at lower temperature is due to the lower charge density and/or collection efficiency as reflected by the lower JSC.
As mentioned above a Warburg-like diffusion impedance was observed in the low frequency range between 0.01 and 50 Hz. It is ascribed to ionic transport or polarisation effect (ferroelectric effect) inside the lattice of the perovskite. The frequency dependent resistance increases with decreasing temperature as shown in Fig. 3 and S2 due to slowing down of the ionic transport or the polarisation in the perovskite solar cell.Fig. 4b presents the real part of the impedance (Z′) at 0.1 Hz as a function of reciprocal absolute temperature. In Fig. 4b one can observe that the change in the Z′ is small for the temperature ranging from 80 to 120 K. For temperatures higher than ∼120 K, Z′ drops significantly. The resistance versus T−1 plot provides an indication of increasing conduction with temperature (i.e. negative temperature coefficient of resistance behaviour for a typical semiconductor) when the temperature is lower than 200 K. Table 1 also compares the photovoltaic parameters of this device obtained from different scan direction under various temperatures. It is interesting that the hysteresis effect becomes weaker when the temperature decreases below 180 K, which might be caused by the phase change and the ionic movements within MAPbI3. The origin of the hysteresis effect is still widely discussed in the literature and its understanding goes beyond the scope of this manuscript.
At equal carrier generation rate, a longer carrier lifetime entails a higher output photovoltage for DSSCs and other organic photovoltaics. The opposite trend is observed within the 80–200 K temperature range reflecting a reduction in the carrier generation rate with decreasing temperature, which is accompanied by a concomitant drop in JSC. Fig. S5 presents differential scanning calorimetry measurements of CH3NH3PbI3, showing a distinct peak at 161 K matching well with the phase transition temperature. Fig. S6 presents the temperature dependence of the real part of the dielectric constant of the perovskite solar cell taken at 0.1 Hz. It shows a discontinuity of ε′ at around 161 K where the tetragonal-I to orthorhombic II phase transition takes place. The results are in good agreement with previous literature findings. The MA ions are fully disordered in the cubic and tetragonal I phase, i.e., at temperatures above 200 K, while they are partially in the tetragonal II phase between 161–200 K. In the orthorhombic phase below 161 K the MA ions are completely ordered and the cations take a fixed position in the lattice. A similar effect has also been observed in metal–organic framework compounds, such as [NH4] [Zn(HCOO)3] and the [(CH3)2NH2][M(II)(HCOO)3] series. As shown in Fig. 4b, the activation energy Eα for the charge carrier movement was calculated to be about 0.012 eV in the temperature range of 80–160 K and 0.155 eV in the range of 160–200 K using the Arrhenius relation, respectively. This implies that the conductivity of CH3NH3PbI3 in the orthorhombic phase exceeds values extrapolated from the tetragonal one. However, as noted above, the photocurrent and fill factor are very small in the low temperature regime, the photo-generated carrier density in the perovskite solar cell at 80–160 K being several orders of magnitude lower than that at 360 K. Whether this behaviour is caused by the ferroelectric character of the orthorhombic phase needs further investigation. Another possible reason for the small photo-generated charge carrier density at low temperature is the incomplete dissociation of Wannier excitons in the bulk of CH3NH3PbI3 or at the interface with the electron and hole selective contact. The binding energy for excitons in CH3NH3PbI3 is about 19 meV, imposing an energy barrier that strongly reduces their degree of dissociation into free carriers with decreasing temperature. Furthermore the band gap of both TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 increases with decreasing temperature according to Eg(T) = Eg(0) − (αT2)/(T + β) where α [eV K−1] and β [K] are material constants and Eg(0) is the energy gap at the temperature T = 0 K. This could affect the band alignment and hence the driving force for exciton dissociation at their interface at lower temperature.

In conclusion, we have investigated the temperature dependence for CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells. The photovoltaic metrics were found to be strongly affected by the phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic phase. The device JSC is very low at low temperature and presents a drastic increase after the phase transition at 160 K. The device VOC displays a unique nonmonotonic dependence on temperature, achieving the maximum value of 1.15 V at around 200 K. The impedance investigation reveals that the recombination lifetime increases as temperature decreases, indicating incomplete dissociation of excitons at low temperature. Probably ionic motion within the bulk of CH3NH3PbI3 is observed with impedance spectroscopy in the different phases. The low frequency behavior in the impedance study reveals its important role on photovoltaic device performance. Further investigations are presently being out to provide a deeper understanding of this intriguing behaviour.
