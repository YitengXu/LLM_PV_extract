In this work, a novel narrow-bandgap conjugated polymer acceptor (PN1) based on electron-withdrawing 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis[3-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)benzene]-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as the core building block and thiophene as the linking unit was developed and applied in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). The PN1 exhibits a broad and strong absorption in the region of 550–800 nm with a high maximum extinction coefficient of 1.28 × 105 cm−1, a high electron mobility of 9.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and more ordered molecular packing. In addition, it also possesses a relatively higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of −3.85 eV, which is beneficial to improve open circuit voltage (Voc) and reduce the energy loss of the device. By matching with the wide bandgap polymer donor PM6, the all-PSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.5% with a large Voc of 1.0 V, a high short circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.2 mA cm−2 and a superior fill factor (FF) of 0.69. Our work demonstrated that PN1 is a promising polymer acceptor for application in all-PSCs.

As a novel renewable energy technology, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention in the past few decades due to their unique advantages of light weight, flexibility, low-cost and being solution processed. Among the various PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of a polymer donor and polymer acceptor as the active layer, have gained consistently increasing attention, owing to their unique advantages of chemical tunability, mechanical flexibility and excellent morphological stability. To date, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-PSCs has reached up to 10–11%. However, the current PCE levels still lag behind that of the state of the art fullerene or small molecule acceptor (SMA)-based PSCs.

From the materials design perspective, to further improve the performance of all-PSCs, one feasible way is to develop polymer acceptors with high absorption coefficients in the visible and near-infrared (IR) regions, high electron mobility, and favorable molecular packing and orientation. So far, among the various n-type semiconducting polymers implemented as electron acceptors in all-PSCs, naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based copolymers, especially {[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200), have been widely used in highly efficient all-PSCs. However, its intrinsic drawbacks such as a low extinction coefficient (0.3 × 105 cm−1) limited the enhancement of short circuit current (Jsc) and hence the PCE of all-PSCs. Another representative polymer acceptor is PZ1, reported by Li et al. by embedding an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) building block with a similar structure to the popular fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA) into the polymer backbone. Notably, the PZ1 showed a broad absorption with a low band gap of 1.55 eV and a high absorption coefficient (1.3 × 105 cm−1) and the corresponding devices achieved an optimal PCE of 9.19%. Most recently, Yan et al. also reported a polymer acceptor PFBDT-IDTIC based on this strategy for all-PSCs, achieving a PCE of 10.3%. Hence, it is probably a promising strategy to introduce the FREA segment into polymer backbones as a building block to design high-performance polymer acceptors.
Based on the above mentioned contents, in this work, we designed and synthesized a novel n-type π-conjugated polymer (PN1, in Fig. 1a) based on an n-type organic small molecular MOITIC16 with a similar structure to ITIC and thiophene units as building blocks. Firstly, ITIC-based FREAs possess a good planar structure, high electron affinity and strong intramolecular charge transfer, which means great potential as a moiety for the design of polymer acceptors. Furthermore, attaching meta-alkoxybenzene with bulky alkyl can not only guarantee the molecular solubility but also improve the photophysical and photoelectric properties, such as the extinction coefficient, intermolecular interactions and charge mobility, which have been proved in our previous work. Hence, the PN1 exhibited a strong and broad absorption in the wavelength region of 550–800 nm with a higher extinction coefficient of 1.28 × 105 cm−1, suitable energy levels with a high LUMO of −3.85 eV, and a high electron mobility of 9.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, PN1 also possessed an ordered molecular orientation and preferred stacking in the face-on direction. In addition, for the polymer donor applied in all-PSCs, apart from the prerequisites such as complementary absorption and matched energy levels with a deep HOMO energy level, the ordered molecular orientation and dominant face-on packing are also critical for the formation of an ideal blend morphology, which is favorable for charge carrier transport and decreasing recombination loss. Hence, the wide bandgap polymer PM6 (Fig. 1a) was chosen as the polymer donor. As a result, the all-PSCs based on PM6:PN1 exhibited an impressive PCE of 10.5% with a Voc of 1.0 V, a Jsc of 15.2 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68.9%, under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2.

The synthetic routes to the monomer (MOITIC16-Br) and PN1 are shown in Scheme S1 in the ESI. PN1 was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling polymerization. Details of synthesis of the monomer, polymerization, and their characterizations are given in the Experimental section in the ESI. After purification, the target polymer PN1 exhibits a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 22.6 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.4, measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent and polystyrene as a standard at 160 °C. As expected, PN1 is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that PN1 possesses high thermal stability with a 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) greater than 340 °C under a N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1 in the ESI).


As shown in Fig. 1b, the UV-vis absorption of PN1 in chloroform solution presents an absorption peak at 671 nm and a weak shoulder peak at 646 nm. Compared with diluted solution, the thin solid film of PN1 exhibits a redshifted maximum absorption peak at 721 nm, originating from the strong aggregation and effective stacking of polymer chains in the solid film. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of PN1 deduced from the absorption edge of the film is 1.55 eV. In comparison with the analogue PZ1, PN1 exhibits a redshifted maximum absorption peak with the same Eoptg, and a similar maximum extinction coefficient of 1.28 × 105 cm−1 (Fig. S2 in the ESI), which is much higher than that (0.3 × 105 cm−1) of N2200. It is evident that the polymer donor PM6 shows a well complementary absorption with PN1 to harvest more light for high Jsc in the devices. The electrochemical properties of PN1 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement (Fig. S3 in the ESI). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PN1 were −5.71 eV and −3.85 eV, respectively, estimated from the onset oxidation and onset reduction potentials, which are similar to those of PZ1. The higher LUMO energy level of PN1 in comparison with N2200 (−4.12 eV) is beneficial for achieving a larger Voc and hence a lower energy loss in the devices. As shown in Fig. 1c, the ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO of the PM6:PN1 pair are 0.21 eV and 0.24 eV, respectively, which can provide enough driving force for exciton dissociation in the devices.


The photovoltaic performance of the PM6:PN1-based all-PSCs was investigated with a conventional structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:PN1/ZnO/Al. Testing of the solar cells was performed under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The device performance was fully optimized in terms of the donor:acceptor (D/A) weight ratio, solvent additive, and thermal annealing (TA) at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1 in the ESI, the devices based on the optimal D/A weight ratio of 1.5:1 (w/w) obtained a moderate PCE of 7.0% with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 13.2 mA cm−2, and an FF of 53.9%. Fig. 2 shows the current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the solar cells based on the PM6/PN1 (1.5:1, w/w) blend spin-coated without an additive and with 3% chloronaphthalene (CN/CB, v/v). The photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated devices under optimal conditions are summarized in Table 1. With the CN treatment, the Jsc and FF of the devices are significantly improved with a minor effect on Voc (Fig. S5 and Table S2 in the ESI). When 3% CN was added, the Jsc was enhanced from 13.2 mA cm−2 to 15.2 mA cm−2 and the FF was dramatically increased from 53.9% to 68.9%, while the Voc was slightly improved, and thus the PCE was significantly enhanced from 7.0% for the as-cast device to 10.5% for the 3% CN treated device. Furthermore, TA treatment was also performed as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S3 in the ESI, and the device exhibited inferior performance relative to the device without TA. Moreover, the optimal device retained 86% of the original PCE after storage in a N2-filled glovebox for 60 days (Fig. S7 in the ESI).

The EQE curves of the PM6:PN1 based all-PSCs without or with an additive are presented in Fig. 2b. The PM6:PN1-based device had a broader photon response over the entire range from 300 to 800 nm, indicating that both the polymer donor and acceptor made a considerable and complementary contribution to the whole Jsc values. The EQE values of the device with 3% CN were much higher than those for the as-cast cells, across the range 480–720 nm, which were indicative of a highly efficient photoelectron conversion process with 3% CN. The corresponding integral current densities of PM6:PN1 based PSCs with no additive and 3% CN are 13.1 and 14.7 mA cm−2, respectively, which match well with the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurements (the errors are both within 5%).

To investigate the influence of the solvent additive CN on the exciton dissociation processes, we measured the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E,T) in the devices. Fig. 2c shows the photocurrent density (Jph) against the effective voltage (Veff) curves. Jph is determined as Jph = 0, where JL and JD are the photocurrent density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is evaluated by using Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when JL = JD, and Va is the applied bias. For these two device, the Jph reaches the saturation current density (Jsat) at high Veff (≥2 V). The P(E,T) is deduced from the Jph/Jsat under the Jsc conditions, and the exciton dissociation efficiency P(E,T) increased from 85.4% for the as-cast device to 92.8% for the device with 3% CN treatment. To further confirm the exciton dissociation in the blend films, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PM6 or PN1 neat film and the blend film as cast or with CN treatment were recorded. As shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI, the blend film with 3% CN treatment exhibited significantly enhanced quenching efficiencies for PM6 and PN1 (91.1% and 95.6%) in comparison with those for the as-cast blend film (83.0% and 94.4%).

Charge-carrier recombination in the blend films was examined by measuring the dependence of Jsc on light intensity, which can be described as Jsc ∝ (Plight)S, where Plight is the light intensity and S is the exponential factor. The value of S is close to 1 when bimolecular recombination of charge carriers is negligible within a device. As shown in Fig. 2d, a slightly improved S value of 0.98 is obtained for the device with 3% CN in comparison with that of the as-cast devices (0.97), which indicated that bimolecular recombination was efficiently suppressed in the optimized devices. The higher exciton dissociation efficiency and weaker bimolecular recombination in the devices with 3% CN were well consistent with the higher Jsc and PCE values.

The charge transport properties of the PM6:PN1 film with 3% CN treatment and as-cast were evaluated for hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:PN1/MoO3/Al and electron-only devices ITO/ZnO-gel/PFN/PM6:PN1/ZnO-NPs/Al by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (see Fig. S9 and Table S4 in the ESI). The electron and hole mobilities for the as-cast film were calculated to be 6.92 × 10−4 and 4.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After 3% CN treatment, the electron and hole mobilities were improved to 9.82 × 10−4 and 9.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The enhanced and more balanced mobilities led to higher FF and Jsc for the devices with 3% CN treatment.


The crystallinity and molecular orientation of both pure films and PM6:PN1 blend films were characterized using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The 2D GIWAXS images and the related line-cut profiles of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) are presented in Fig. 3b. PN1 showed an obvious (010) diffraction peak at 1.58 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 3.97 Å in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak at 0.24 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 26.17 Å along its IP direction, suggesting a predominant “face-on” orientation relative to the substrate. PM6 exhibits face on and edge on orientation in the pure film (Fig. 3a). In the PM6:PN1 blend films without and with 3% CN, an obvious (010) diffraction peak in the OOP profiles showed combined diffraction features from PM6 and PN1, and appear as broad peaks that cannot be easily separated, which means that these blends still remain in a predominant “face-on” orientation. The (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction of PM6:PN1 blend films without or with 3% CN are both located at 1.67 Å−1, corresponding to a π–π stacking d-spacing of 3.76 Å (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, the peaks located at 0.28 Å−1 in the IP direction were assigned to the (100) lamellar, corresponding to a lamellar stacking d-spacing of 22.44 Å. For the PM6:PN1 blend film with 3% CN, the intensities of π–π and lamellar stacking scattering peaks were enhanced in comparison with the pristine blend film. The coherence length (L100) using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of IP (100) in the PM6:PN1 blend films also showed the same trend. The L100 of the PM6:PN1 pristine blend film remained at 5.7 nm, while a clear increment of L100 (13.8 nm) could be observed after adding 3% CN, which indicated that the crystallinity of the polymer has been increased when the 3% CN additive was added. The preferable molecular orientation was beneficial for charge transport and collection and resulted in a high Jsc and high FF in all-PSCs.

Moreover, the phase separation of the blend films with different treatments was probed by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) using 284.8 eV photon energy. As shown in Fig. 3c, 3% CN treatment showed a higher scattering intensity with a broad hump. This was attributed to the fact that the additive changed the intermolecular interaction of the donor and acceptor, resulting in a relatively bad miscibility and achieving purer phases. From analysis using the Debye–Bucherer method, the correlation length of the blend film with 3% CN was found to be 19.8 nm, while the as-cast blend film had a correlation length value of 16.6 nm. The appropriate phase separation scale was conducive to exciton dissociation and charge transport in the devices which is favorable to achieve higher Jsc and PCE. These results agreed well with the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
The surface and bulk morphologies of the PN1 film and PM6:PN1 blend films were investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4, the pristine blend films were uniform and smooth with a root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 1.90 nm, and weak phase separation was observed, indicating good miscibility between PM6 and PN1. After 3% CN treatment, the blend films showed a relatively coarse surface with an Rq value of 4.52 nm. Furthermore, a more appropriate phase separation of the donor and acceptor with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network was observed in the film with 3% CN which facilitated exciton dissociation and charge transport, and thus resulted in higher Jsc and FF.

In conclusion, a novel polymer acceptor PN1 based on a fused-ring electron acceptor as the building block was designed and synthesized. PN1 exhibited a narrow Eoptg of 1.55 eV with a strong absorption in the 550–800 nm region and a high electron mobility of 9.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. When blended with the wide bandgap polymer donor PM6 to fabricate devices, the PM6:PN1-based devices achieved an optimal PCE of 10.5% with a remarkable Voc of 1.0 V and a small energy loss of 0.55 eV in the device. Furthermore, using CN as a solvent additive can enhance the crystallization and phase separation of the blend to form a better interpenetrating morphology, and thus higher and balanced mobilities to suppress bimolecular recombination, leading to ∼50% improvement in PCE. Notably, PN1 also possesses a high extinction coefficient of 1.28 × 105 cm−1 and a high LUMO energy level, which is beneficial for achieving high Jsc and Voc. These results indicate that PN1 is a promising polymer acceptor for high efficiency all-PSC application to promote the development of all-PSCs.
