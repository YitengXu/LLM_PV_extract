Four novel D–D–π–A configuration metal-free organic dyes (C3, P2, C2 and P3) with triphenylethylene phenothiazine moieties or triphenylethylene carbazole moieties as additional electron donors for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been synthesized. The cells based on C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes with efficiencies of 2.14%, 2.69%, 5.51% and 6.55%, respectively, are obtained. The P3 based cell exhibits the highest efficiency of 6.55% accompanied by a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.18 mA cm−2, a rather high open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 826 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.65, performances which are remarkable in the DSSCs based on metal-free organic dyes. The twisted non-planar configuration in P3 decelerates the charge recombination in the charge-separated state and hence contributes to the improvement of the performance of DSSCs.

Over the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the currently used commercial silicon based solar cells, have attracted increased attention because of their low-cost and acceptable conversion efficiency potential. As a critical component in DSSCs, the sensitizer plays a vital role in the light harvesting efficiency providing electron injection into the conduction band of an oxide semiconductor (e.g. TiO2) upon light excitation. Nowadays, the maximum power conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs based on the Zn-complex dye has achieved 12.3%. Our recent reports on hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure photoelectrodes consisting of both nanoparticles and one-dimensional nanorods showed significant photovoltaic performance using N719 and CdS/CdSe as sensitizers because of its multi-functional properties (excellent electron transport, large surface area and superior light scattering). In recent years, organic dyes have gained interest because of their variety of molecular structures, high molar extinction coefficient, simple and environment friendly preparation process and low cost. As a promising and cost-effective alternative to traditional metal-complex dyes, DSSCs based on metal-free organic dyes have made remarkable progress. In the last decade, numerous investigations on π-conjugated molecules with donor–acceptor moieties, such as oligothiophene, indoline, triphenylamine and coumarin have been conducted.

In general, the performance of DSSCs depends on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the relative sensitizers and the kinetics of the electron-transfer processes. Therefore, the molecular structure of the organic dyes plays an important role in DSSCs and several design principles have been concluded as follows: (1) The HOMO of organic dyes should be below the energy levels of the redox mediator (e.g. I−/I3−) and the relative LUMO should be above the conduction band edge of the semiconductor (e.g. TiO2) electrode. (2) The electron distribution of HOMO should be mainly localized on the donor part, which is further away from the semiconductor surface, and the electron distribution of LUMO should be mainly localized near the anchoring group (e.g. carboxylic acid). And (3) a wide absorption range of organic dyes covering the whole visible and some of the near-infrared or infrared region is required for molecular structure design, at the same time, the molar extinction coefficient should be high enough. However, the systematic study of the effects of twisted non-planar structures in organic dyes still needs to be further improved.
Very recently, the D–D–π–A type of metal-free organic dyes based on triphenylamine and carbazole have been reported by Tian's group. This type of dyes show a bathochromic shift, broad and intense absorption in the visible light region, as well as better thermo-stability as compared with the D–π–A type. These studies have suggested that the HOMO and LUMO energy level tuning of organic dyes can be achieved by attaching additional donor moieties to increasing the hole transporting ability of dyes. Consequently, the D–D–π–A configuration of organic dyes has been reported by Tian to demonstrate superior performance over the simple D–π–A configuration in DSSCs. A further improvement was expected to be accomplished by introducing triphenylethylene phenothiazine or triphenylethylene carbazole moieties at the end of each molecule to form a D–D–π–A structure following the reports on the twisted structure of triphenylethylene carbazole derivatives for aggregation-induced emission (AIE). The triphenylethylene structure was expected to extend the absorption region, reduce the tendency to aggregate on the TiO2 surface, act as a hole transporter, as well as tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels at the same time. Phenothiazine and carbazole are aromatic heterocyclic compounds with electron-rich nitrogen or sulfur heteroatoms, and have attracted great interest for their excellent hole-transporting ability, rigid structure and large π conjugated system.
In the current study, special consideration was given to the design of the molecular structure to determine its correlation to the performance of DSSCs, a series of organic dyes whose structures were slightly different from one to another were prepared (Fig. 1). Afterwards, the effects of different donor structure units on the photophysical, photochemical and photovoltaic properties were investigated. To the best of our knowledge, there are no systemic reports on the introduction of AIE twisted structure into a dye molecule for DSSC.

Bis(4-fluorophenyl)methanone, 9H-carbazole, 10H-phenothiazine, 1-bromohexane, diethyl 4-bromobenzylphosphonate, potassium tert-butoxide, n-butyllithium in hexane (2.2 M), trimethylborate, bis(pinacolato)diboron, [1,1′-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene] palladiumm(II) chloride [Pd(dppf)Cl2], N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), cynaoacetic acid, Aliquat 336, tetrakis (triphenyl-phosphine) palladium(0) and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (electrochemical grade) purchased from Alfa Aesar were used as received, All other reagents and solvents were purchased as analytical grade from Guangzhou Dongzheng Company (China) and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled from sodium/benzophenone. Ultra-pure water was used in the experiments. The intermediates, C2B,3a and 3b, were synthesized according to the literature methods.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Mercury-Plus 300 spectrometer, and chemical shifts were reported in ppm (CDCl3 as solvent and TMS as the internal standard). Mass spectra (MS) were measured on a Thermo DSQ MS spectrometer. Elemental analyses (EA) were performed with an Elementar Vario EL elemental analyzer. UV-visible absorption spectra (UV) were determined on a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrometer with a slit width of 3 nm for both excitation and emission. The DMF-water mixtures with different water fractions were prepared by slowly adding ultra-pure water into the DMF solution of samples under ultrasound at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was carried out on a Shanghai Chenhua electrochemical workstation CHI660C in a three-electrode cell with a Pt disk counter electrode, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a glassy carbon working electrode. All CV measurements were performed under an inert argon atmosphere with supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4) in dichloromethane (MC) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using ferrocene (4.80 eV vs. vacuum) as standard. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were obtained using the onsets oxidation potentials from the CV curves. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital/highest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO/HOMO) energy gaps ΔEg for the compounds were estimated from the onsets absorption of UV-vis absorption spectra in MC.


Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses were cleaned in the order of detergent solution, water and ethanol using an ultrasonic bath overnight. Firstly, the TiO2 (20 nm particle size) paste was screen-printed onto FTO coated glass (15 Ω/square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan). The paste fabrication process was carried out according to the previous paper. Briefly, TiO2 powder (20 nm) (1.0 g) was ground for 40 min in the mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath, to finally form a viscous white TiO2 paste. The thickness of films can be easily controlled through repeating screen-printing times. Afterwards, a heating process (325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and then at 500 °C for 15 min) to remove the organic substances was used. The as-prepared TiO2 nanostructured films (TiO2/FTO) were soaked in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, which improved the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance. The TiCl4-treated as-prepared films were rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the films were immersed in a 5.0 × 10−4 M solution of the C3, P2, C2, P3 and N719 dyes (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in MC, and sensitized for about 16 h. Afterwards, the films were rinsed with MC or acetonitrile (N719) to remove physisorbed dye molecules. To evaluate their photovoltaic performance, the dye-sensitized TiO2 nanostructured FTO films were sandwiched together with Pt-coated FTO glass, which was used as a counter electrode. Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by thermally depositing H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glass. The electrolyte (0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile, and valeronitrile (85:15)) was injected into the space (25 μm) between the sandwiched cells. The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.16 cm2.


To measure the amount of adsorbed dye on the TiO2 film, the dye/TiO2 film was immersed in a 0.1 M aqueous solution of NaOH (3.0 mL) and UV/Vis absorption spectra of the desorbed dye solution were measured by using a Hitachi U-3900 spectrophotometer. The current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). A 1000 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel, Model: 6271) was served as a light source and its incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a optical filter to approximate AM 1.5 G one sun light intensity before each measurement. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were held on the Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation in dark condition, with an applied bias of −0.75 V. A 10 mV AC sinusoidal signal was employed over the constant bias with the frequency ranging between 1 MHz and 10 MHz. The impedance parameters were determined by fitting of the impedance spectra using Z-view software. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated green light emitting diode (457 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, PP211), which can provide both DC and AC components of the illumination. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 100 KHz to 0.1 Hz.

The synthetic routes of P2B and C2B are shown in Scheme 1. The triphenylethylene phenothiazine derivative is first introduced into the organic dyes to reduce the tendency to aggregate, as well as to tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The intermediate compounds P2Br and C2B were synthesized according to procedures in a previously published study by our laboratory. The boric acid ester moiety of P2B was introduced by the addition of bis(pinacolato)diboron to a tetrahydrfuran solution of P2Br in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2.

The synthetic routes of the target compounds, C3, P2, C2 and P3, are shown in Scheme 2. The triphenylethylene derivatives, which have a twisted structure, were introduced by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. The introduction of carbazole and phenothiazine units into the twisted structure of triphenylethylene derivatives may potentially improve the performance of solid-state DSSCs considering its excellent hole-transporting ability. Compounds 3a and 3b were prepared from 9H-carbazole and 10H-phenothiazine via N-alkylation reaction with 1-bromohexane, bromination reaction with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), as well as Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with POCl3 and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) according to the literature procedures. Compounds 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b were synthesized via Suzuki reactions. The molecular structures of the products were confirmed using proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis.
The ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorption spectra of C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes were measured in MC, in DMF and on TiO2 film. Table 1 summarizes the photophysical properties of all the as-synthesized dyes. Fig. 2(a) shows the UV-vis spectra of the dyes in MC solutions. Dyes C3 and C2 have several absorption peaks in the ultraviolet region of 238, 293, and 329 nm to 341 nm, as well as in the visible light region of 412 nm for C3 and 462 nm for C2. Evidently, the visible absorption maximum of dye C2 is 50 nm red-shifted in contrast to C3. Dyes P2 and P3 have three prominent absorption peaks in the regions of 258, 326 nm to 335 nm, and 412 nm for P2 and 466 for P3 nm. In accordance, the visible absorption maximum of dye P3 compared with P2 is 54 nm red-shifted.

For these four dyes, the absorption maxima (DMF solutions, Fig. 2b) in the ultraviolet region show a bathochromic shift; however, the absorption maxima in the visible light region show a blue shift compared with the spectra in MC solutions (see Table 1). This interesting phenomenon is ascribed to the deprotonation of cyanoacrylic acid derivatives in DMF. Generally, because of the basic nature of DMF the equilibrium will shift to deprotonated species lead to blue shifted charge transfer absorption. It was verified by solvatochromism and acid/base studies. In various solvents, such as toluene (TOL), MC, tetrahydrofuran (THF), DMF, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), only the solutions of the dyes in DMF show pronounced aforementioned wavelength changes (Fig. S1, ESI); And the aborption spectra were strongly affected by the alkalinity or acidity of the solutions (Fig. S2, ESI).
As shown in Fig. 2(c), the absorption spectra on TiO2 are broadened as compared with that in MC (Fig. 2a), and the absorption in the ultraviolet region decreases; however, the absorption in the visible light region increases. Interestingly, this phenomenon can also be observed in water/DMF solutions with different volume fractions of water (Fig. 2d) and could be explained as follows: after the addition of 50% volume fraction of water, C3, P2, C2 and P3 in the water/DMF mixtures began to aggregate into nanoparticles. The nanoparticle suspensions were transparent with no precipitate and were still stable after two days, and probably consisted of J-aggregate formation, which is always accompanied with a bathochromic shift of the UV absorption maximum. As a consequence, the emission spectra also display a bathochromic shift in DMF as compared with the data in 80% water fraction of water-DMF mixture (see Table 1). Furthermore, the better absorption of P3 in contrast to C2 and of P2 in contrast to C3 (see Fig. 2a and c) implies that the absorption of triphenylethylene phenothiazine moiety is superior to the triphenylethylene carbazole moiety.
To evaluate the possibility of transfer from an excited dye molecule to the conduction band of TiO2, the oxidation (Eonsetox) potentials vs. Ag/AgCl of the dyes were measured in MC (0.5 mM) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the calculation of the HOMO (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 2, the HOMO levels of C3, P2, C2 and P3 were −5.02, −4.99, −5.03 and −5.01 eV, respectively. All the values could lead to an efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye in contrast to −4.60 eV of iodide, avoiding the geminate charge recombination between oxidized dye molecules and photo-injected electrons in the nano-crystalline TiO2 film. The optical band gaps estimated from the onset absorption spectra were 2.45, 2.42, 1.92 and 1.89 eV, respectively, for C3, P2, C2 and P3. The calculated LUMO levels of C3, P2, C2 and P3 were −2.57, −2.57, −3.10 and −3.12 eV, respectively, which could provide the thermodynamic driving for charge generation relative to the conduction band edge of the semiconductor electrode (TiO2, −4.00 eV). Comparing the LUMO levels of the dyes, the values of C2 and P3 are sufficiently more negative than those of C3 and P2, which may be the main reason for the higher efficiencies of C2 and P3. Accordingly, there may be an exact value of LUMO that better matches the conduction band edge of TiO2. Compared with N719, the HOMO and LUMO of these dyes have lower energy values, which indicates a higher stability against oxidation and an advantage for solar cell applications.

To gain insight into the molecular structure and electron distribution, the geometries of the dyes were optimized by density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, for C3 and C2, the electron density of the HOMO state is distributed along the triphenylethylene carbazole moiety. However, for P2 and P3, the electron density of the HOMO state is distributed along one of the end phenothiazines of the triphenylethylene phenothiazine moiety. It may imply that the nonplanar phenothiazine blocked by triphenylethylene can make electron distribution of HOMO separate from electron distribution of LUMO (see Fig. 4). Under the intramolecular charge transfer along the π-conjugated skeleton, the LUMO of the dyes is localized near the anchoring group (carboxylic acid) through the π-conjugated linker, which is beneficial for efficient electron injection into the anode. Thus, the HOMO–LUMO excitation induced by light irradiation could move the excited electron distribution from the triphenylethylene unit to the electron-accepting cyano acid group, and injected into the conduction band of TiO2 through the anchoring group. The calculated HOMO and LUMO values are summarized in Table 2. From Table 2, a part of the experimental values is not in agreement with the calculated values, which is a common phenomenon in many related literatures. However, comparing the experimental and calculated values independently reveals that the donor close to the acceptor is a determining factor of the electron distribution of the LUMO, whereas the donor blocked by triphenylethylene is a determining factor of the electron distribution of the HOMO. The dipole moments (μ) of the dyes were calculated and also summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the μ values followed the order P3 > C3 > C2 > P2. The polarizability of P3 is the highest among these dyes. Generally, as more μ induces more negative charge to TiO2 conduction band and larger polarizability causes stronger interaction with surrounding acceptor species. This factor is one of possible reasons why P3 exhibits the highest performance of DSSC.
The photocurrent density-photovoltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs based on the C3, P2, C2 and P3 performed under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5(a). The photovoltaic properties of these dye-based DSSCs are summarized in Table 3. The DSSC based on C3 shows an efficiency of 2.14%, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 4.55 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 682 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.69. However, replacing the triphenylethylene carbazole unit with a more twisted triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit to construct P2, the performance of DSSC based on P2 improved (η = 2.69%, Jsc = 5.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 711 mV, and ff = 0.72). To further study the correlation between the molecular structure and their performance in DSSCs, we replaced 9-hexyl-9H-carbazole in C3 with a non-planar 10-hexyl-10H-phenothiazine to construct C2, the performance of DSSC based on C2 improved rapidly (η = 5.51%, Jsc = 10.76 mA cm−2, Voc = 793 mV, and ff = 0.64). Afterwards, we replaced the triphenylethylene carbazole unit in C2 with a more twisted triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit to construct P3, a further increase in performance of the DSSC based on P3 was achieved (η = 6.55%, Jsc = 12.18 mA cm−2, Voc = 826 mV, and ff = 0.64). Therefore, the increasingly twisted structures in C3, P2, C2 and P3 match the order of their increasing performance in DSSCs. Under the same measurement conditions, the DSSC based on dye N719 generated an efficiency of 8.84% (Jsc = 16.91 mA cm−2, Voc = 783 mV, and ff = 0.67), and clearly, the DSSCs based on C2 and P3 possessed higher Voc.

The comparisons of P3 with P2, and C2 with C3, reveal that the electron-richer and twisted non-planar phenothiazine may be considered more favorable than the planar carbazole, given that it should better match the device. Furthermore, the non-planar structure also can decelerate the charge recombination in the charge-separated state resulting in a higher Voc. The higher open-circuit voltage values of P3 relative to C2 and P2 relative to C3 can be predicted, given that the triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit possesses a better-twisted non-planar structure than the triphenylethylene carbazole unit. Therefore, the triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit can more efficiently decelerate the charge recombination in the charge-separated state and reduce the tendency of aggregation, considering that aggregation leads to unfavorable back electron transfer and decreases the Voc value of the device. Most AIE derivatives have twisted non-planar structures, hence, Voc may be improved by introducing the AIE structure unit after comparing the open-circuit voltage of P3 and C2 with that of D1 (595 mV) and T2-1 (712 mV).

Fig. 5(b) shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) data as a function of the wavelength for DSSCs based on the C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes. The IPCE spectra changing tendency of the dyes are in accordance with their UV-vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. However, the onsets of the IPCE spectra for C2 and P3 are 720 and 720 nm, respectively, which are significantly broadened, as compared with those of 663 and 665 nm for their UV-vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. This phenomenon has already been reported and the exact reason still needs further studies. In our case, a possible reason is that the non-planar 10-hexyl-10H-phenothiazine unit is connected to the anchoring carboxylic acid moiety only by a conducting ethylene unit, which makes it very close to the TiO2 film. Thus, the non-planar 10-hexyl-10H-phenothiazine unit is easily influenced by the photo-injected electrons in TiO2 film, and this effect probably has an effect of planarization on the non-planar phenothiazine, which could lead to a bathochromic shift. However, carbazole is a planar structure, as can be predicted, the onsets of the IPCE spectra of C3 and P2 are nearly equal to that of their UV-vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 film.
The IPCE values of DSSCs based on C2 and P3 exceeded 70% from 450 nm to 480 nm (with the highest value of 71.4% at 470 nm) and from 400 to 540 nm (with the highest value of 79.3% at 480 nm), respectively. In the DSSCs based on C3 and P2, the IPCE values relatively exceed 70% from 410 nm to 420 nm (with the highest value of 70.7% at 420 nm) and from 360 nm to 440 nm (with the highest value of 78.5% at 420 nm). Comparing C2 with P3 and C3 with P2, it is revealed that the triphenylethylene phenothiazine donor unit in P3 and P2 can be considered as the main reason for the higher IPCE values, which would lead to the broadened high IPCE performance (>70%). The higher and broader spectra response of the P3 based cell within the whole visible region might contribute to a higher photocurrent. The higher IPCE at a range of 350–550 nm for P2-sensitized solar cell than that of the C3-sensitized DSSC could be attributed to the higher molar absorption coefficient (ε) in shorter wavelength of C3. And one of the possible reasons for the higher IPCE at a range of 350–700 nm for P3 cell as compared to C2 cell could be ascribed to the larger adsorbed amount of P3. Comparing the IPCE spectrum of P3 with T2-1 indicates that the introduction of the triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit may be an effective method of broadening high IPCE performance.
To further elucidate the photovoltaic results and obtain more interfacial charge transfer information in DSSCs sensitized by C3, P2, C2 and P3, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed in the dark under a forward bias of 0.75 V. The Nyquist and Bode plots for C3, P2, C2 and P3 sensitized cells are shown in Fig. 6a and 6b, respectively. In general, a typical EIS spectrum of a DSSC exhibits three semicircles in the Nyquist plots, which are located in order of increasing frequency and are assigned to the Nernst diffusion within the electrolyte, the charge transfer at the oxide/electrolyte interface, as well as the redox reaction at the Pt counter electrode. And in a Bode phase plot, a typical EIS spectrum of a DSSC has three characteristic frequency peaks. However, only two semicircles can be observed in the present Nyquist plots, since the Nernst diffusion within the electrolyte is overlapped by the intermediate-frequency large semicircle (Fig. 6a). These findings indicate the fast electron transport and long electron lifetime in TiO2 film. After fitting the EIS spectra to an electrochemical model, several important parameters such as the series resistance (RS), charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rrec), and charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface (RCE) can be obtained. RCE inversely scaling with the reduction rate of I3− ions at the Pt/electrolyte interface is estimated by the small semicircle width. The small RCE values of C3, P2, C2 and P3 mean fast reduction of I3− ions at Pt counter electrode. RS and RCE corresponding to the first semicircle are almost the same in C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes-based DSSCs due to using the same electrode material and electrolyte. The simulated data of lifetime (te) can be estimated by te = Rrec × CPE2, herein, te value of 121.9 ms (Rrec = 89.1 Ω and corresponding capacitance, C = 1370.5 μF), 182.7 ms (Rrec = 151.7 Ω and C = 1204.3 μF), 388.6 ms (Rrec = 342.9 Ω and C = 1136.4 μF) and 481.1 ms (Rrec = 524.3 Ω and C = 918.2 μF) for the DSSCs based on dyes C3, P2, C2 and P3, respectively, were obtained. The lifetime order of C3 < P2 < C2 < P3 is consistent with the Voc results above.
In consideration of these results, given that P2 relative to C3 and P3 relative to C2 have more non-planar triphenylethylene phenothiazine derivative at the end of molecules, they may more efficiently block the approach of I3− ions to the TiO2 surface, in spite of C3 showing a larger amount of adsorbed dye than P2 (Table 1). The excellent hole transporting ability of phenothiazine or carbazole derivative may improve the regeneration of the sensitizers. Therefore, the high Voc values of 826 mV for P3 and 793 mV for C2 may be explained.
To gauge the dynamics of electron transport and charge recombination of the four DSSCs, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) are further measured under an illumination of a LED light source (λ = 457 nm) with different light intensities from 30 to 150 W m−2. Transport time (τd) and lifetime (τr) curves as a function of light intensity derived from IMVS and IMPS measurements are shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the transport time and electron lifetime of the DSSCs based on C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes decrease with increasing light intensity. The transport time values of the DSSCs are in the order of C3 > P2 > C2 > P3, whereas the electron lifetime values are in the order of C3 < P2 < C2 < P3, which account for the remarkable increase in Voc from C3, P2, C2 to P3. Comparison of P3 with C2 and P2 with C3 dyes suggests that the triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit with twisted non-planar triphenylethylene and non-planar phenothiazine at the end of the dye molecules could better protect the injected electrons from the recombination process than the triphenylethylene carbazole unit, rendering the higher Voc. The non-planar phenothiazine close to the anchoring group or near the TiO2 surface is indicated to be beneficial for dyes to adsorb on TiO2 film (Table 1), which is responsible for the longer electron lifetime, as seen by comparing P3 with P2 and C2 with C3, respectively. As a consequence, the higher Voc values of P3 relative to P2 and C2 to relative to C3 are ascribed to the suitable LUMO energy levels (Table 2) and the non-planar structure near the anchoring group.
To study the electron transport and recombination properties, charge-collection efficiency (ηcc) derived from IMPS and IMVS measurements were apparently considered as meaningful parameters. In sensitized solar cells, ηcc can be calculated by a expressions ηcc = 1 − τd/τr.Fig. 7(c) shows that the dependence of the charge collection efficiency on the light intensity, and the efficiency values of the DSSCs based on the as-synthesized dyes are in the order of C3 < P2 < C2 < P3. However, the measurement of the charge collection efficiency of the DSSCs based on C2 and P3 dyes presents an interesting result, i.e., their values approach 1 for light intensity from 30 to 150 W m−2. This may be ascribed to the cooperative effects of suitable LUMO levels and the twisted structure of triphenylethylene phenothiazine moiety or triphenylethylene carbazole moiety. In contrast, the charge collection efficiencies (96–98%) of the DSSCs based on C3 and P2 dyes increase slightly with increasing light intensity. According to the expression of Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0,ηcc is in direct proportion to Jsc of the sensitized solar cells. The above results imply that the introduction of triphenylethylene phenothiazine moiety is superior to that of triphenylethylene carbazole moiety, both of which could considerably suppress the electron recombination process, and the purpose of improving Voc may be accomplished by introducing the twisted structure in the solid state of AIE derivative.
The PL spectra of C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes were investigated in water-DMF mixtures (Fig. 8). A bathochromic shift combined with decreased intensity in the C3, P2, C2 and P3 emission spectra with increasing water fraction is observed, showing aggregation-caused emission quenching (ACEQ) effect. However, many triphenylethylene derivatives previously reported in our laboratory were AIE compounds. This observation is ascribed to the solvent polarity effect and intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state. Before the formation of aggregates, D–A type molecules tend to adopt a more twisted conformation in a more polar solvent, hence, the excited luminogens are in the twisted intramolecular charge transfer state referred to as nonradiative quenching processes. The large red shift with decreased PL intensity might be related to the stabilization of the excited state. Similar emission spectra are often observed in highly polarized molecules exhibiting enlarged dipoles and charge-transfer characters in their excited states, which undergo changes from ICT states to solvent-relaxed emissive states. Given that C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes are highly polarized D–A type molecules with strong push–pull interactions that satisfy all the given criteria, the PL spectra of C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes could be explained by the cooperative effects of the above. The fluorescence exhibited by the as-synthesized dyes in the solvent is quenched in the aggregated and solid states because of ACEQ effect, which is attributed to a nonradiative deactivation process. The ACEQ of the as-synthesized dyes is aroused by the cyanoacrylic acid section because compounds 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b in the solid state still give strong fluorescent emission properties showing high AIE effect. Accordingly, most of AIE structures could be introduced to organic dyes to improve the photovoltaic performance, at the same time the fluorescence in the solid state can be quenched if the dyes use cyanoacrylic acid as an electron acceptor. Based on the fundamental processes in the DSSCs, the ACEQ of C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes is beneficial for the high conversion efficiency of photovoltaic energy, after considering that the AIE compounds use a portion of sunlight to emit longer wavelength light back. Therefore, the current study is successful in introducing the twisted structure of the AIE structure section to the C3, P2, C2 and P3 dyes without importing the AIE property, which may helpful to improve the Voc and conversion efficiency of photovoltaic energy.

A series of efficient organic dyes with a twisted AIE structure as an additional donor has been designed and synthesized. The maximum Voc and power conversion efficiency are 826 mV and 6.55%, respectively, under standard AM 1.5 G solar conditions, as compared with 783 mV and 8.84% for N719 dye under the same experimental conditions. The introduction of a triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit into organic dyes is reported for the first time, and evidence for the advantage in structure leading to a high photovoltage in the DSSCs is given. It has been found that the introduction of twisted non-planar AIE structure can improve the performance of DSSCs, and its fluorescence in the solid state can be quenched, which is beneficial for the high power conversion efficiency. The current study presents a workable method to introduce the twisted structures of AIE compounds to organic dyes, which involves increasing the donor moiety with AIE derivatives to form a D–D–π–A configuration. The twisted structure of the triphenylethylene phenothiazine unit at the end of the dye molecules may result in a longer electron lifetime, faster transport time and higher charge collection efficiency as compared with the triphenylethylene carbazole unit. Both triphenylethylene phenothiazine and triphenylethylene carbazole units could improve the open-circuit photovoltage and DSSCs performance, as seen by comparing the open-circuit voltages and efficiency values of P3 and C2 with that of T2-1. The increasing of the twisted non-planar structure in organic dyes is a promising way to improve the performance in DSSCs. To obtain better DSSCs performances, new molecular designs should take into consideration to introduce other twisted AIE structures.
