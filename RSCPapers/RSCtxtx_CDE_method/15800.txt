In this work, a thiazole moiety was employed as a π bridge incorporated into the backbone of quinoid polymers. The new strategy combined the characteristics of a thiazole unit with a deep HOMO energy level and a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene moiety (TT) with broad absorption. Two isomeric D–A copolymers, PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5, were synthesized, with different orientations of the thiazole to the TT moiety. Interestingly, in comparison with PTBTz-5, PTBTz-2 exhibited an even lower HOMO energy level, a higher dipole moment, and a more planar molecular configuration, together with preferable phase domains and good intermixing with PC71BM. Thus, a superior PCE of 9.72% for the photovoltaic device was obtained, with a remarkable JSC of 16.84 mA cm−2, which is among the highest values for a single-junction solar cell. This is an increase of ∼40% in PCE in comparison with PTBTz-5 (PCE = 6.91%) and twice as much as for PBT-0F with thiophene as the π-bridge (PCE = 4.5%). This work not only provides a promising high-performance thiazole-containing system, but also reveals that the orientation of the asymmetric unit along the polymer backbone plays a crucial role and should be taken into account in future molecule design.

During the past decade, the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been significantly improved, with a sustained impact on the design of new light-harvesting materials, construction strategies and device engineering. Here, we report a new design strategy of introducing a weak acceptor thiazole moiety as a π bridge into the backbone of a quinoid polymer, which not only utilizes π bridges to regulate the energy levels, but also maintains the broad optical absorption originating from the quinoid structure. Two isomeric polymers, PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5, were synthesized, with different orientations of the thiazole relative to the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) unit. The results showed that both polymers exhibit a deep HOMO energy level and high crystallinity. Moreover, the polymer PTBTz-2 displays a superior photovoltaic performance, with a remarkable JSC of 16.84 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 9.72%. This represents an increase of ∼40% in comparison with PTBTz-5 (PCE = 6.91%), which was ascribed to preferable phase separation and good intermixing with PC71BM. This work not only provides a promising fabrication strategy for the design of high-performance photovoltaic materials, but also reveals that the orientation of the asymmetric unit along the polymer backbone plays a crucial role and should be taken into account in future molecule design.


Currently, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are expected to play an important role in a future energy marketplace, due to their scalability, rapid energy payback time and low carbon emissions. As important light-harvesting materials in OPVs, conjugated polymers possess unique advantages of excellent electronic properties, low cost, flexibility, and ease of solution processing. In recent years, the donor (D)–acceptor (A) strategy has been proven very effective in designing high-performance copolymers, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11% in polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been realized, with a sustained impact on the design of new building blocks, and on construction strategies and device engineering. Nevertheless, a π bridge also plays a significant role in energy levels, backbone configuration, and intermolecular interactions for D–A copolymers. Up to now, penta-heterocycle thiophene, furan, and selenophene have been used as π-spacers in constructing efficient materials. However, they are unfavorable in obtaining deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the corresponding polymers, due to the low electron affinity of the electron-rich heterocycle. By contrast, another thiophene analogue, thiazole, exhibits stronger electron affinity, due to the replacement of a CH group of thiophene by a more electron-negative nitrogen atom. Meanwhile, thiazole can reduce the steric hindrance with the neighboring unit, which favors enhancing the planarity of the backbone. Thus far, work has mainly focused on thiazolothiazole, 5,5′-bithiazole and benzobisthiazole as electron-deficient building blocks rather than on a single thiazole unit, and the maximum PCE was only 7.2%. By comparison, only a few studies employed a single thiazole as a π bridge in PSCs, and the reported polymers exhibited a decrease in the frontier orbital energy levels and an improvement in the open circuit voltage (VOC), but still obtained low PCEs of <6%. This can be attributed to the mismatch of energy levels (thiazole-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP2Tz)-based polymers) and relatively low molecular weight and hole mobility (dithiazolylbenzothiadiazole (DTzBT)-based polymers). On the other hand, quinoidal structures have attracted great attention when constructing low bandgap polymers, although they have a high HOMO energy level. An ideal model will be obtained when a thiazole unit with a deep HOMO energy level and a quinoidal structure with broad absorption is employed to construct new D–A copolymers, which would give more favorable energy levels. Meanwhile, the influence of different orientations of the π bridge resulting from the asymmetry of the 2- or 5-position of the thiazole unit can be taken into particular consideration, which has never been reported previously. Here, two isomeric polymers PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5 were designed, based on the well-known quinoidal structure thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) as the A moiety and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the D building block, together with thiazole as a π bridge. Interestingly, when the thiazole unit was incorporated into the main chain of the PBDT–TT system, the polymer presented a more linear backbone, just like that of PTB-0F with thiophene as a π bridge, which was beneficial to more ordered inter-chain packing. The results show that both polymers exhibit bigger dipole moments and relatively deep HOMO energy levels and, in turn, high VOCs of >0.82 V in corresponding devices, which are much higher than that of just the polymer PBDTTT-E-T without a π-bridge (0.68 V) and PBT-0F (0.56 V). In comparison with the polymer PTBTz-5, PTBTz-2 exhibits an even lower HOMO energy level, higher dipole moment, and more planar molecular configuration, together with preferable phase domains and good intermixing with PC71BM. Thus, a superior PCE of 9.72% for the photovoltaic device was obtained for PTBTz-2 with a remarkable short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.84 mA cm−2, an increase of ∼40% in comparison with that of PTBTz-5 (PCE = 6.91%) and twice as high as that of PBT-0F (PCE = 4.5%). This work not only provides a promising high-performance thiazole-containing polymer system, but also reveals that the orientation of the asymmetric unit along the polymer backbone plays a crucial role and should be taken into account in future molecule design.


The synthetic routes of the monomers are shown in Scheme 1. The compounds 1 and 5 were synthesized according to the previous literature. To construct a 2-position linked polymer, the key monomer 4 was obtained in three steps of esterification, Stille coupling with a 2-position thiazole and bromination reaction with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), starting from compound 1. Then it was copolymerized with bis(trimethyltin) BDT (5) via a Stille coupling reaction to yield the target polymer PTBTz-2. In contrast, for a 5-position linked polymer, the bis(trimethyltin) monomer 7 based on thiazole was directly synthesized in two steps. Then it was copolymerized with dibromo TT (2) to yield another target polymer, PTBTz-5. The polymerization was terminated by cooling to room temperature and precipitating in methanol. The precipitate was purified by Soxhlet extraction and afforded a black powder. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as eluent at 150 °C gave a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 18.6 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.72 for PTBTz-2 and an Mn of 27.1 kDa with a PDI of 3.10 for PTBTz-5 with respect to a polystyrene standard. Both polymers showed good thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 358 and 378 °C for PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI).

From Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI), we can see that the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymers PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5 show very similar saddle-shaped profiles, covering a broad absorption range from 300 nm to 720 nm. The absorption edges (λonset) and maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of PTBTz-2 are slightly red-shifted by 10 and 5 nm, respectively, compared to those of PTBTz-5. The λonset values of PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5 are 727 and 717 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.70 and 1.73 eV, respectively. In addition, the absorption maximum of both polymers at around 610 nm has a high molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of ∼4.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In contrast, the extinction coefficient of PTBTz-2 can reach ∼1.14 × 105 cm−1 in the solid state, slightly higher than that of PTBTz-5 (Fig. S2, ESI). Furthermore, it is worth noting that the two polymers show a defined vibronic structure with an absorption peak at ∼660 nm, and meanwhile they exhibit a strong 0–0 peak (λ0–0) together with a weak 0–1 peak (λ0–1) charge transfer transition absorption, implying that there should be strong inter-chain aggregation. To make clear the aggregation behaviour of both polymers in solution, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5 in dilute chlorobenzene solution (10−5 M) were recorded from room temperature with heating to 100 °C (Fig. 1). The UV-vis absorption spectra recorded during the heating process indicate that the defined vibronic structures are gradually weakened, accompanied by a blue-shift of several nanometers for the main absorption at ∼610 nm. Finally, the intensity ratio of I0–0/I0–1 between λ0–0 and λ0–1 was applied to further estimate the aggregation degree. Although I0–0/I0–1 values decreased almost linearly as the temperature increased to 100 °C in increments of 10 °C, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), the two polymers exhibited an obvious difference. For the PTBTz-2, the I0–0/I0–1 value was less than 1 when heated to 60–70 °C, indicating that the aggregation was already broken. In contrast, PTBTz-5 exhibited relatively higher I0–0/I0–1 values at the same temperatures, indicating stronger aggregation in the solution. Even if the temperature was increased to 100 °C, the aggregation was not broken completely, as deduced from the I0–0/I0–1 value of ∼1. The above results clearly demonstrate the existence of strong intermolecular stacking even in dilute solution for the two polymers, due to the incorporation of thiazole units and the formation of an isolated polymer chain under continuous heating, and also indicate that different orientations of the thiazole moiety have a significant effect on the stacking property of the corresponding polymers.
In order to better understand the aggregation–structure relationship for these two polymers, the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level was employed to explain the difference at a molecular level. As shown in Fig. 2, one can observe that the thiazole ring can obviously reduce the steric hindrance with the neighboring rings, resulting in higher planarity of the molecule compared to the PTB-0F with thiophene as a π bridge. The polymer PTBTz-2 exhibits distinct planarity, with small dihedral angles of <1° between the thiazole group and the central TT unit, together with a dihedral angle of <6° simulated between BDT and the flanking thiazole group. The “planar” polymer backbone will yield a strong driving force to form intermolecular stacking. In contrast, for PTBTz-5, the BDT and two thiazole units can be considered as a unit, due to the negligible dihedral angles, and thus the strong aggregation behavior of the polymer can be partially ascribed to the high planarity of the BDT-2Tz unit, which is composed of multiple fused rings.
The redox properties of the two polymers were investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S3 (ESI), the onset oxidation potential of PTBTz-2 was +1.13 V, larger than that of PTBTz-5 (+1.02 V). The corresponding HOMO energy levels are estimated to be −5.54 eV and −5.43 eV, calculated from the empirical equation: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.41) V, and these values are much lower than those of PBDTTT-E-T (−5.09 eV) and PTB-0F (−4.90 eV). Moreover, the DFT calculation results also confirm the sharp decrease in the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels when thiophene is switched to thiazole (Table 1, and Fig. S4, ESI). The above results were consistent with the initial expectation of employing thiazole as a π bridge to decrease the HOMO energy level, and the low HOMO levels would ensure the stability of the polymers and potentially increase the VOC of the photovoltaic devices.

The dipole moment from the ground to the excited state (Δμge) is another key parameter for organic photovolatic materials. Previously, Yu et al. have reported a positive correlation between increased PCE and larger computed values of Δμge, calculated by the semiempirical AM1 method. Then, Coughlin et al. independently employed the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to evaluate Δμge compared to experimental results. We also adopt the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to calculate the dipole moments for two repeating units of polymers PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5, as shown in Table S1 (ESI). The repeating units of polymer PTBTz-2 have larger Δμge (12.13 D) than that of PTBTz-5 (9.58 D), which are much larger than that of PTB-0F (1.88 D). The larger Δμge value could effectively lower the Coulomb binding energy of the exciton in the excited state and lead to faster charge separation kinetics. Consequently, it can be predicted that PTBTz-2 will give a more promising performance in photovoltaic devices.
The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs were fabricated with the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al to investigate the photovoltaic performance. The devices were optimized for different conditions (solvent, D/A weight ratios, additive), as shown in Fig. 3, Table 2, Fig. S5, S6 and Table S2 (ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and photovoltaic parameters of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2. Both polymer-based devices exhibit desirable VOCs of >0.82 V, which are the highest values among the TT-based polymers (especially non-fluorine substituted polymers). The results also strongly confirm that inserting a weak acceptor as a π bridge into the main backbone of the quinoid polymer can result in a higher VOC. Without any additive, the best solar cell based on PTBTz-2/PC71BM gave a PCE of 6.93% with a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 13.43 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 59.3%. When 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the blend solution, encouragingly, the PCE increased to 9.72% with a simultaneous increase in JSC to 16.84 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69.5%, which was an increase of over 50% in comparison with that of PBDTTT-E-T (PCE = 6.21%) and twice as much as that of PBT-0F with thiophene as the π-bridge (PCE = 4.5%). Meanwhile, another solvent additive, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), does not work well for photovoltaic performance (Table S2 and Fig. S5c, ESI). In contrast, the best photovoltaic device based PTBTz-5 exhibits a PCE of only 6.91%, with a low JSC of 13.11 mA cm−2. The relatively poor PSCs performance of PTBTz-5 could be partially ascribed to the stronger aggregation property observed from the solution absorption and phase images discussed later. The PCE of 9.72% for PTBTz-2 is the highest reported value in thiazole-containing polymers solar cells (Table 3 and Fig. S8, ESI), and is also comparable to that of the well-known polymer PTB7-Th (Table 2 and Fig. S7, ESI). However, there should still be a great deal of scope to further increase the photovoltaic performance through device engineering relating to PTB7-Th:PC71BM.

From the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) curves of the optimal devices (Fig. 3b), we can see that both devices show a good photo response in the 400–700 nm region. Moreover, polymer PTBTz-2 exhibits a significantly higher curve than PTBTz-5 in this range, which could account for the higher JSC and PCE of PTBTz-2. The current densities integrated from the EQEs are 16.5 mA cm−2 and 12.7 mA cm−2 for PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5, respectively, in accordance with the JSCs recorded from the J–V curves. We also compared the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymer/PC71BM blend films under optimal conditions (Fig. S7, ESI). The PTBTz-2/PC71BM film exhibits a higher extinction coefficient than the PTBTz-5/PC71BM film, which could be beneficial to a higher JSC. The hole mobilities of the polymers were investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The J–V curves of the hole-only devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI). The hole mobility of the PTBTz-2/PC71BM blend film is 2.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, slightly higher than that of PTBTz-5/PC71BM film (1.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1).
Furthermore, the morphology of the active layers was investigated by atom force microscopy (AFM) and bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 4). As can be seen from the AFM height images, without any additives both blend films exhibit a very rough surface, with a root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of >7 nm. Meanwhile, from the TEM and the phase images of AFM, some PC71BM show strong aggregations of a size of over 200 nm, which are very unfavorable for exciton separation. Interestingly, after 3% DIO was added, the morphologies demonstrate a dramatic change to relatively desirable nano-phase separation, which supports the significant increase in JSC in the photovoltaic devices. However, the blend film of PTBTz-5/PC71BM still exhibits a granular structure with a domain size of 30–50 nm (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the PTBTz-2/PC71BM film exhibits a more homogeneous fibril-like nano-phase separation, with an excellent bicontinuous interpenetrating network, which is beneficial to charge transfer and leads to a great improvement in FF and JSC. The significant difference in morphology between the PTBTz-2 and PTBTz-5 is closely related to their aggregation properties, originating from the molecular orientations of the thiazole unit in the backbone. Overall, the excellent morphology and phase separation should be one of the main reasons why the PTBTz-2 polymer enables high photovoltaic performance.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to further investigate the crystalline characteristics of both polymer/PCBM blend films without or with solvent additives. It can be observed that all blend films show only strong (h00) reflections in the out-of-plane (qz) direction (Fig. S10, and Table S3, ESI). Without the DIO, the lamellar stacking (100) peaks of PTBTz-2, and PTBTz-5 are observed at qz = 2.701 and 2.716 nm−1, corresponding to interchain distances of 23.2 and 23.1 Å, respectively. The similar d100-spacing is due to the fact that the lamellar stacking is mainly determined by the alkyl side chains, and different orientations of thiazole will not have any significant influence. With 3% DIO as a processing additive, the (h00) peaks of both blend films obviously increase, accompanied by a slightly smaller d100-spacing (22.7 Å). Apart from a distinct second-order alkyl stacking peak (200), it is worth noting that an obvious third-order alkyl stacking peak (300) for PTBTz-5 appears (Fig. S10d, ESI). The presence of higher-order reflections is a strong indicator of crystallite quality, implying the evolution of a long-range ordered structure. The stronger reflections observed in the PTBTz-5/PC71BM blend film are consistent with its stronger aggregation in solution and larger polymer domains in AFM and TEM.

In this work, the thiazole moiety was employed as a π bridge incorporated into the backbone of quinoid polymers, and the influence of different orientations of the thiazole relative to the TT moiety was systematically investigated. The polymer PTBTz-2 exhibits a lower HOMO energy level, and better planar molecular configuration, together with preferable phase domains and good intermixing with PC71BM. Consequently, a remarkable PCE of 9.72% with a high JSC of 16.84 mA cm−2 was obtained, which is also one of the highest efficiencies in polymer/PCBM systems. More importantly, higher efficiencies could be expected through further optimization of the side chain and of the donor building blocks, as well as of the device structures. This work not only provides a promising high-performance thiazole-containing polymer system, but also reveals that the orientations of asymmetric units along the polymer backbone play a crucial role and should be taken into account in future molecule design.
