Dye-sensitized solar cells are currently under intense academic and industrial investigation, owing to their great potential to serve as a low-cost alternative to existing photovoltaic technologies. This paper puts forward a method, which adopts heterocyclic substituted triarylamine units as electronic donor moieties, to design triarylamine dyes for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. Three novel triarylamine dyes named TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103, were synthesized economically through modification of the structure of a simple triarylamine dye (TC105) using three kinds of heterocyclic groups (4-pyridyl, 2-thienyl and 1-pyrazolyl). The crystal structure of TTC103 indicates that the heterocyclic groups would partly delocalize the positive charge after photooxidation. The overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) of TTC102 and TTC103 are 4.92% and 5.21% respectively under AM1.5G irradiation, reaching ∼82.3% and ∼77.7% of a N719-based reference cell under the same conditions. Besides, the energy conversion efficiencies (η) of TTC102 and TTC103 are 1.29 and 1.37 times the efficiency of TC105 respectively. All of the results above demonstrate that photovoltaic performance can be improved by introducing suitable heterocyclic groups to triarylamine dyes. A series of properties were investigated to explain the results, with a special emphasis on the geometric structures, energetics, and charge transfer processes at the dye/titania/electrolyte interface.

Over the past two decades, there has been more and more interest in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency. During the conversion process of photons to current in a DSSC device, the photosensitizer has a key role in determining solar-cell performance. Compared with rare and expensive ruthenium complex dyes, metal-free organic dyes are more suitable for cost-effective environmentally-friendly photovoltaic systems. However, it is still a challenge for us to design metal-free organic dyes with a convenient synthesis route and excellent performance in DSSCs.

Triarylamine dye based DSSCs are presently under intense academic investigation due to their prominent electron donating ability and the hole-transport properties of the triarylamine unit. Many groups developed triphenylamine dyes consisting of different substituted triarylamine units, π-bridges and electron acceptors to study in detail the effect of different dye structures on the performance of DSSCs. Triarylamine dyes consisting of heterocyclic substituted triarylamine units were barely reported. Considering that heterocyclic groups with lone pair electrons may effectively delocalize the positive charges after the photooxidation of dyes, it can be predicted that using suitable heterocyclic groups to modify the structures of triarylamine units may improve their electron donating ability. Based on this consideration, we introduce in this article a method, which adopts heterocyclic substituted triarylamine units as electronic donor moieties, to design triarylamine dyes for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.

Scheme 1 shows the molecular structures of the proposed dyes based on this idea. The core structures are based on TC105 which is reported elsewhere, with 1,4-phenyl as the π-bridge and cyanoacetic acid as the electron acceptor. In the previous reports, DSSCs based on TC105 dye have been fabricated and efficient photovoltaic performances have been discussed in detail. Using TC105, K. R. J. Thomas and his coworkers obtained a solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) of 4.98% under AM1.5G irradiation, reaching ∼66.1% of a N719-based reference cell under the same conditions. X. C. Yang and his coworkers obtained an energy conversion efficiency (η) of 4.05% based on TC105. Through introducing three kinds of heterocyclic groups (4-pyridyl, 2-thienyl and 1-pyrazolyl) into triarylamine units, we developed three new organic dyes, named TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103, respectively.
The properties of TC105, TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103, such as UV-vis absorption spectra, emission spectra, emission lifetime, energy levels, quasi-reversible oxidation/reduction waves, and electrochemical impedance spectra, were tested and discussed in detail. In order to analyze the geometric structure of this kind of dye, a carmine crystal of TTC103 was synthesized and the crystal structure was discussed in detail. TC105, TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 were employed as sensitizers in DSSCs. In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the three dyes objectively, we employed N719 as the reference dye and manufactured the reference cell. Then, the photovoltaic performance of the devices under irradiation of AM1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) was investigated in detail. Photovoltaic tests demonstrate that the DSSCs' performance can be improved after the introduction of suitable heterocyclic groups to triarylamine dyes. A series of properties, such as dark current and electrochemical impedance spectra, were investigated to explain the results, with a special emphasis on the geometric structures, energetics, and charge transfer processes at the dye/titania/electrolyte interface.

TC105 was synthesized according to previously published procedures. Synthetic routes to TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 are depicted in Scheme S1. Tris(4-bromophenyl)amine was used as a starting material. 4-Pyridyl and 2-thienyl groups were introduced to the triphenylamine structures by the Suzuki cross coupling reaction, whilst 1-pyrazolyl groups were introduced by a modified Ullmann condensation method using a copper-catalyzed system. Then, heterocyclic substituted triphenylamine compounds 1–3 were reacted with (4-formylphenyl)boronic acid by the Suzuki cross coupling reaction. After that, Knoevenagel condensations of aldehydes 4–6 and cyanoacetic acid lead to the target dyes, TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103. The synthetic route and preparation details of TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 are presented in the ESI. A crystal of TTC103 was obtained from TTC103's acetonitrile solution.


Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates, Pt counter electrodes and N719 dye were purchased from Hepat Chroma Solar Tech Co. Ltd., Dalian, China. The sheet resistance of the FTO glass was 15 Ω cm−2. For the preparation of a DSSC, FTO glass plates were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then rinsed with water and ethanol. Then, the plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrodes were prepared by a screen printing technique. TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 paste for screen printing were prepared by methods reported by Grätzel and his co-workers. The TiO2 paste consisted of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles, ethyl cellulose as a binder, and α-terpineol as a solvent. The TiO2 paste was printed on FTO glass plates and subsequently sintered at 500 °C in air for 1 h. The thickness of the 6 × 6 mm2 TiO2 thin films was ca. 12 μm. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min.

Then, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed into 0.4 mM dye (TC105, TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103) solution in a 3:2 mixture of CHCl3 and EtOH, or 0.4 mM N719 in MeCN over 24 h. The dyed films were washed in acetonitrile to remove non-attached dye from the pores. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes and the Pt counter electrodes were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a Surlyn film as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of the electrolyte solution was placed in the drilled hole of the counter electrode and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness). The electrolyte introduced into the cell was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in a solvent mixture of 85% acetonitrile with 15% valeronitrile by volume. An Al foil was taped at the back side of each counter electrode to reflect unabsorbed light back to the photoanode.

A xenon light source (Oriel) was used to give an irradiance of 50–130 mW cm−2 at the surface of a testing cell. Current–voltage curves were recorded under 50, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 130 mW cm−2, using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The measurement delay time was fixed to 40 ms with 100 measurement points scanning from Voc to Jsc. For the setup used in our measurements, there was no hysteresis in the I–V curves when reversing the scan direction.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSCs was measured by a DC method. The light source was a 300 W Xenon Lamp (Oriel 6258) coupled with a flux controller to improve the stability of the irradiance. The light passed through a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125) to select a single wavelength with a resolution of 10 nm. The monochromatic light beam was then focused on the active region of the device. Light intensity was measured by a NREL traceable Si detector (Oriel 71030NS) and the short circuit currents of the DSSCs were measured by an optical power meter (Oriel 70310).

All calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 program package. Without any symmetrical constraints, the geometrical structures of TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 were optimized by the PM6 quantum chemistry method (a semiempirical method). Incorporating the optimized model in the ZINDO method, we calculated excitation energies and oscillator strengths of TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103.


UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was studied by a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer for the liquid phase. Fluorescence spectra were measured by a Perkin Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer at room temperature for the liquid phase. TiO2 nanoparticle films (thickness: 12 μm) were immersed into 0.4 mM dye solutions in a 3:2 mixture of chloroform and ethanol for 24 h, and UV-vis absorption spectra of the sensitized dye on TiO2 was obtained by a Shimadzu MPC-3100 spectrometer at room temperature for the solid phase. Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves were recorded using a Chenhua CHI630C model electrochemical workstation (Shanghai), while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was studied using a Chenhua CHI660I model electrochemical workstation (Shanghai).

To estimate the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 films, the sensitized 6 × 6 mm2 electrodes were separately immersed into a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent (water:ethanol = 1:1), which resulted in the desorption of each dye. The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured by a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer.

The electronic absorption and emission spectra of the TC105, TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 sensitizers dissolved in chloroform are shown in Fig. 1. As we can observe, the absorption curves of TTC102 and TTC103 are relatively similar. Absorption peaks (λmax) are observed at 368 nm (ε = 31100 M−1 cm−1) for TTC101, 340 nm (ε = 42500 M−1 cm−1) and 425 nm (ε = 27100 M−1 cm−1) for TTC102, 338 nm (ε = 47400 M−1 cm−1) and 440 nm (ε = 28400 M−1 cm−1) for TTC103 (Table 1). Both TTC102 and TTC103 have two absorption peaks, one at 300–400 nm and one at 400–500 nm, whilst TTC101 has only one absorption peak at 368 nm. Actually, there is also an inconspicuous peak at 400–500 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectrum of TTC101. Because absorption peaks at 300–400 nm reflect trivial ultraviolet absorption for DSSCs, we do not discuss them in detail here.

The absorption at 400–500 nm is due to an intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from the triarylamine units to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor moiety. Compared with the absorption peak of TC105 (410 nm, 19400 M−1 cm−1), the electronic absorption is red-shifted and enhanced after the introduction of 2-thienyl (TTC102) or 1-pyrazolyl (TTC103) groups to the triarylamine units. These results may arise from the varying electron donor abilities of the triarylamine units, depending on whether they are substituted by heterocyclic groups.
Contrary to the electronic absorption, the emission maxima of the three dyes show a blue-shifted tendency from TTC101 to TTC103, Whilst the emission peaks of the three dyes become increasingly wider in the order of TC105, TTC101, TTC102, and TTC103. Fig. S3 shows the absorbance profile of the dyes on TiO2. The onset points of the absorption spectra are red-shifted, in comparison with the absorption spectra of the dyes dissolved in chloroform. Strong interactions between the adsorbed dye molecules and the oxide surface are known to lead to aggregate formation, and consequently, broadening of the absorption spectra when the dyes are adsorbed on the oxide surface. The broadening of the absorption spectra of dyes on TiO2 might be due to dye–TiO2 interactions, dye–dye interactions, or both, on the TiO2 surface.

Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves (Eox and Ered in Table 2) were recorded for the dyes TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 2). The oxidation may be attributed to the triphenylamine moieties, while the reduction may be assigned to the cyanoacrylic acid. Due to the similar structures, both oxidation and reduction potentials of TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 are similar.

The zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) estimated from the absorption onset and the ground-state oxidation potential (Eox) were used to calculate the excited-state oxidation potential (). The deduced  values of these three dyes are more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicating that the electron injection process should be energetically favorable. On the other hand, the ground-state oxidation potentials (Eox in Table 2) of these three dyes are more positive than the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide couple (0.4 V vs. NHE). This suggests that the oxidized dyes should be able to accept electrons from I− thermodynamically for effective dye regeneration, which should restrain the charge recombination process between the oxidized dyes and photoinjected electrons in the TiO2 film.

The electron distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 are shown in Fig. 3 (larger pictures of HOMO–LUMO levels are shown in Fig. S2, ESI). The HOMO of these compounds is populated over the substituted triarylamine and the linked heterocyclic groups. Among the three kinds of heterocyclic groups, the 2-thienyl groups on TTC102 and the 1-pyrazolyl groups on TTC103 match primarily with the triarylamine unit on the HOMO level, while the 4-pyridyl groups make a small contribution to the HOMO level of TTC101. The LUMO is delocalized across the 2-cyano-3-phenylacrylic acid group, with a sizable contribution from the cyanophoric and carboxylic moieties. Distributions on HOMO and LUMO levels are separated in all three compounds indicating that the HOMO–LUMO transition can be considered as a charge–transfer transition.

The HOMO and LUMO levels of TTC102 and TTC103 are almost the same, whilst the HOMO and LUMO levels of TTC101 are lower than the levels of TTC102 and TTC103. Calculations also show that the HOMO–LUMO gap (ΔE) of TTC101 is lower than ΔE values of TTC102 and TTC103. These results are in qualitative agreement with experimental absorption spectra, which might also be attributed to the relatively poor electron donating ability of the 4-pyridyl groups and relatively similar ability of 2-thienyl and 1-pyrazolyl groups to delocalize positive charges after photooxidation of the dyes. Due to the relatively short π-bridge, which may cause the poor response in the near-infrared region, ΔE values for TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 were relatively larger than that of regular dyes.

Because crystal structure of an organic compound can partly explain the stable geometric structure of the compound, we synthesized a carmine crystal of TTC103. X-Ray analysis reveals that the complex crystallized in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c. The asymmetric unit just contains one TTC103 molecule. As shown in Fig. 4, we define the six rings in the symmetric unit as rings 1–6, and the planes based on rings 1–6 as planes 1–6. As a result of calculations, we obtained the angles between planes [Plane 1 and Plane 4 (33.301°), Plane 2 and Plane 5 (21.356°), Plane 3 and Plane 6 (24.660°)]. The angles reveal that electrons can transfer smoothly between the 1-pyrazolyl groups and the linked triarylamine unit, which indicates that the 1-pyrazolyl groups would partly delocalize the positive charge after the photooxidation of TTC103.


We fabricated DSSCs sensitized by TC105, TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 to test and compare their photovoltaic properties. In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs based on the three dyes objectively, we employed N719 as the reference dye and manufactured a reference cell. All four cells were fabricated under the same conditions using 0.6 M DMII, 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M GuNCS in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15) as the electrolyte, and an FTO glass anchored 12 μm porous 20 nm sized TiO2 nanoparticle film as the counter electrode.


J–V curves for the DSSCs were recorded under irradiation of AM1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and are presented in Fig. 5. The exact results were summarized in Table 3. Among the fabricated DSSCs, the overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) of N719 reaches the maximum value of 6.33% (Jsc = 16.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.745 V, and FF = 50.05%), and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of TTC102 reaches the maximum value of 0.766 V, which is close to the value of TC105. Although the short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc, 11.71 mA cm−2) and fill factor (FF, 59.23%) of TTC103 are very close to the values of TTC102, there is a wide gap (0.057 V) between the open-circuit voltages of TTC102 (Voc = 0.766 V) and TTC103 (Voc = 0.709 V). This wide gap may largely be attributed to the higher dark current or charge recombination rate of the TTC103-based DSSC compared to the TTC102 cells, as shown in Fig. 5. The slightly higher-lying HOMO of TTC103 may also decrease the driving force of dye regeneration by the electrolyte, I−/I3−. The gap has the largest contribution to the difference of the energy conversion efficiency (η) of TTC102 (5.21%) and TTC103 (4.92%). The performance of the DSSC based on TTC101 is not as good as that of TTC102 and TTC103 (Jsc = 7.02 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.701 V, FF = 60.77%, and η = 2.99%), which may be mainly due to the introduction of two 4-pyridyl groups weakening the electron donating ability of the triarylamine units. From the above photovoltaic parameters from the J–V curves (Table 3), the overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) of TTC102 and TTC103 are 4.92% and 5.21% respectively under AM1.5G irradiation, reaching ∼82.3% and 77.7% of the N719-based reference cell under the same conditions. Besides, the energy conversion efficiencies (η) of TTC102 and TTC103 are respectively 1.29 and 1.37 times the efficiency of TC105 (3.80%), which directly demonstrates that the photovoltaic performance is improved after the introduction of 2-thienyl or 1-pyrazolyl groups to TC105 dye when employed in DSSCs.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data of these dyes was collected and presented in Fig. 6. N719 shows the broadest solar light response range with a maximum value of 68% at 520 nm. The IPCE spectra of TC105 and TTC101 show their relatively narrow solar light response ranges (300–550 nm) with a maximum approaching 40% from 330 to 430 nm. The maximum IPCE values of TTC102 and TTC103 are 60% at 420 nm and 59% at 431 nm respectively. IPCE values of TTC102 between 350 and 425 nm are higher than that of the TTC103 dye, partly due to the lower dark current. The IPCE values of TTC102 and TTC103 are greater than that of N719 in the range of 350–470 nm which is included in the strong wave band of sunlight.
The photocurrent density–voltage curves for the DSSCs were recorded under irradiation with different light intensities over the range of 50–130 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters' dependencies on the light intensity for the devices are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7(a) shows that Jsc values have linear dependencies on light intensities over a wide range, which has been well established in previous reports. The comparison of Jsc values for four dyes is consistent with Table 3. Fig. 7(b) tells us that the Voc values of each dye don't change obviously with different light intensities for the DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 7(c), the fill factor for each dye decreases in general, along with the increase of light intensity. The overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) are obtained by calculation using the above parameters. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the maximum energy conversion efficiencies (η) of TC105, TTC101, TTC102, TTC103 and N719 are 4.44% (50 mW cm−2), 3.68% (60 mW cm−2), 5.60% (50 mW cm−2), 5.09% (60 mW cm−2), and 9.28% (50 mW cm−2) respectively. All of the four maximum efficiencies (η) are obtained under irradiation of the lower light intensity, which would be mostly ascribed to the enhanced fill factors.
Considering a higher Jsc value may be due to more dye molecules being attached on a TiO2 electrode, dye loading experiments have been conducted to correlate to device performance. According to the Beer–Lambert law and the molar extinction coefficient of each dye (Fig. 1 and Table 1), amounts of dye adsorbed for TC105, TTC101, TTC102, TTC103, and N719 were determined as 4.7 × 10−7, 5.7 × 10−7, 2.7 × 10−7, 3.3 × 10−7, and 2.5 × 10−7 mol cm−2 respectively. These results demonstrate that the higher Jsc value for N719 or TTC102 can not be ascribed to more dye molecules being attached on the TiO2 electrode.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is a powerful tool to characterize the important interfacial charge transfer processes in the DSSCs, was used to collect data for each cell under illumination of AM1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) at open-circuit potential. Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of DSSCs are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S5 respectively. Two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots, which are assigned to the charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface (left peaks) and dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface (right peaks). The results generated from the EIS experiments have been listed Table 4.

The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) on the TiO2 surface, which is related to the charge recombination rate between injected electrons and electron acceptors (I3−) in the electrolyte, is estimated by the large semicircle width. A large Rrec means a small charge recombination rate and vice versa. The Rrec values for TC105, TTC101, TTC102 and TTC103 were estimated to be 14, 22, 30 and 18 Ω respectively. Evidently, the charge transfer resistance at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface was increased from TTC101 (or TTC103) to TTC102 according to Fig. 8. Since a slower charge recombination rate corresponds to a larger resistance, from the evidence this result means that the charge recombination was suppressed upon replacing 4-pyridyl (or 1-pyrazolyl) with 2-thienyl groups on the triarylamine unit, which was consistent with the Voc value of TTC102 being higher than that of TTC103. Therefore, the higher charge recombination rate may partly result in the existence of the wide gap (0.057 V) between the open-circuit voltages of TTC102 and TTC103.

We introduce in this article a method, which adopts heterocyclic substituted triarylamine units as electronic donor moieties, to design triarylamine dyes for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. Three novel triarylamine dyes have been synthesized through modification of the structure of a simple triarylamine dye (TC105), using three kinds of heterocyclic groups. A carmine crystal of TTC103 was obtained and the crystal structure indicates that 1-pyrazolyl groups could partly delocalize the positive charge after the photooxidation of TTC103. DSSCs sensitized by TC105, TTC101, TTC102, TTC103 and N719 (reference dye) were fabricated. The overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) of TTC102 and TTC103 are 4.92% and 5.21% respectively under AM1.5G irradiation, reaching ∼82.3% and 77.7% of the N719-based reference cell under the same conditions. The energy conversion efficiencies (η) of TTC102 and TTC103 are respectively 1.29 and 1.37 times the efficiency of TC105. All results above demonstrate that photovoltaic performance can be improved after introducing suitable heterocyclic groups to triarylamine dyes when employed in DSSCs. A series of properties, such as dark current and electrochemical impedance spectra, were studied to characterize the important interfacial charge transfer processes in the DSSCs. Structural modification of TTC101 and TTC102 dyes, to improve the light absorption in the red and near-IR ranges for higher photovoltaic performance, is in progress.
