Ternary organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have recently attracted intense research attention since they have been proven as an effective approach to enhance device performance. We herein describe a new strategy to realize high-performance ternary OPVs by using biaxially extended octithiophene (8T)-based wide-bandgap (Eg) conjugated polymers as the third photoactive component. Owing to the π–π transition of the biaxially extended conjugated side-chains, such polymers exhibit intense absorption in the near-ultraviolet region, in addition to the original intra-charge transfer (ICT) feature arising from the main backbone, revealing a new molecular design for wide-Eg polymers. By further tailoring the polymer backbone with p-type moieties such as thiophene (T) or thienothiphene (TT), two wide-Eg (∼2.0 eV) polymers, P8TT and P8TTT, with absorption wavelengths below 650 nm, were prepared, showing high complementary absorption to the spectra of both the state-of-the-art fullerene-(PTB7-Th:PC71BM) and non-fullerene-based (PBDB-T:ITIC) bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) systems. By providing suitable energy levels, P8TTT was demonstrated to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of its derived fullerene- and non-fullerene-based ternary blends by 7.58% and 6.60%, respectively, with only a small loading amount (10 wt%). This study manifests a new perspective in wide-Eg material design for realizing efficient ternary BHJ systems.

The development of solution-processable organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) as one of the most promising green photovoltaic techniques has accelerated in the past few years owing to breakthroughs in the exploitation of novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Compared to typical fullerene derivatives, the newly exploited NFAs generally possess a more intense light-harvesting capability and tailorable light-absorption region, which indirectly promotes the recent trend of ternary OPVs.

Originally, the photoactive layer of OPVs consists of a donor (D)/acceptor (A) binary blend, wherein a nanoscale D–A bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) is formed to facilitate the dissociation of photoexcitons. However, adding an additional component to a binary BHJ system to either extend its overall light-harvesting window or optimize its nanoscale phase separation has recently been demonstrated as an effective strategy to further enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the derived devices. Noteworthily, compared to binary BHJ systems, ternary BHJ systems might also possess higher charge extraction efficiency owing to its better energy-level cascade for charge transport and dissociation, thus reducing the overall potential loss of the devices.
Ternary OPVs can be classified according to the nature of the third component, such as donors, acceptors, inorganic materials, and nonvolatile additives. Among them, the addition of a second functional D or A is the most commonly adopted method thus far. For example, at the earlier stage, owing to the poor light absorption of fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl C61/C71 butyric acid methyl esters (PC61BM/PC71BM), adding a third component with complementary absorption to the host donor of the fullerene-based BHJ system has been widely employed to extend its light absorption across the solar spectrum to realize improved performances. Furthermore, the third photoactive component might also prevent the aggregation of fullerene derivatives to improve the thermal stability of the device to a certain degree.
A similar principle can also be applied to the recently developed NFA-based BHJ systems but with a slightly different focus. For example, NFAs, such as the representative (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) (ITIC) derivatives, generally possess a small bandgap (Eg) of ∼1.6 eV, providing intense light absorption across wavelengths in the range of 600–850 nm, which is complementary to the absorption spectrum of state-of-the-art polymer donors with average Eg of ∼1.7–1.8 eV. Therefore, the third component added to the ITIC-based BHJ systems is generally required to possess a wide Eg (>1.9 eV), so as to realize panoramic absorption of the solar spectrum. In addition, such a wide-Eg component might afford Förester resonance energy transfer (FRET) to the pristine photoactive components, further enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency. As the current record PCEs of OPVs are realized in NFA-based BHJ systems, the further reduction of energy loss through ternary cascade energy levels is also specifically noticed.
In this regard, various wide-Eg third components, including NFAs and polymer donors, have been recently exploited to realize high-performance ternary OPVs. Based on a similar principle, we herein manifest a new perspective in wide-Eg materials design for efficient ternary BHJ systems using p-type biaxially extended octithiophene (8T)-based alternating copolymers as the third photoactive component (Fig. 1a). Owing to the π–π transition of the biaxially extended conjugated side-chain groups, the derived 8T-based polymers can exhibit intense absorption in the near-ultraviolet region, in addition to the original intra-charge transfer (ICT) feature arising from the main backbone. By further tailoring the polymer backbone with p-type moieties such as thiophene (T) or thienothiphene (TT), two wide-Eg (∼2.0 eV) polymers, P8TT and P8TTT, with absorption wavelengths below 650 nm were prepared, showing very complementary absorption to the spectra of both state-of-the-art fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ systems, as shown in Fig. 1b and c. This result reveals a new molecular design of wide-Eg polymers for pairing with typical BHJ systems. By providing suitable energy levels, P8TTT was demonstrated as an efficient third photoactive component to simultaneously enhance the performance of both state-of-the-art binary fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ systems with only a small adding amount (10 wt%). We also characterized the morphology and optoelectronic properties of the 8T-based ternary BHJ systems to clarify the roles that the 8T-based polymers play in performance enhancement.

The polymer donors PTB7-Th and PBDB-T were purchased from 1-Material (Canada) and used without further purification. The 8T-based polymers P8TT and P8TTT were synthesized according to previously reported procedures.


The inverted OPVs were fabricated with the device configuration of ITO glass/ZnO/PFN/BHJ/MoO3/Ag. The ITO glass substrates were first cleaned by sonication with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, in sequence, for 15 min each. Then, the substrates were dried by N2 flow, followed by plasma treatment for 10 min. The ZnO precursor was prepared by dissolving 0.1 g mL−1 zinc acetate in 2-methoxyethanol with 28 μL ethanolamine. The ZnO layer was deposited onto the ITO substrates by a spin-coating method and annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. The MeOH solution of PFN (0.5 mg mL−1) containing 2 vol% acetic acid was spin-coated onto the ZnO-coated substrate in a N2 glovebox. The binary fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PBDB-T:ITIC in a 1:1.5 and 1:1 weight ratio in CB with DIO additive (CB/DIO = 97/3 and 99.5/0.5, v/v), respectively. The ternary fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ precursor solutions were prepared by adding P8TT and P8TFT with a weight ratio of 0.1 with respect to the host polymer into the pristine binary BHJ systems. All these precursor solutions were vigorously stirred at 60 °C for 8 h in a N2 glovebox. Then, ∼100 nm BHJ layers were spin-coated onto the PFN layer. For the NFA-based BHJ system, the films were further annealed at 90 °C for 10 min in a N2 glovebox. Finally, 8 nm-thick MoO3 and 10 nm-thick Ag were thermally deposited under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr) to complete the top electrode. The active area of the device was 10 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the as-fabricated OPVs were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (SMU) under AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination by a Newport LCS-100 simulator. The illumination intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode detector with a KG-5 filter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded using monochromatic light from a xenon lamp during illumination (QE-R, Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated from 300 to 800 nm using a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.


Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 instrument operating at a voltage of 200 kV with a Gatam dual vision charge coupled device (CCD) camera. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data were acquired on the BL17A1 beamline with a wavelength of 1.322 Å at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. Contact angles (CA) were measured for the surface energy analyses.


As reported in the literature, side-chain engineering plays a significant role in polymer design and can improve the overall solubility of the prepared polymers, modulate the intra/inter-molecular packing pattern, and tune the associated optoelectronic properties. Recently, Chen et al. developed a series of biaxially extended thiophene-based conjugated polymers, where a unique conjugated side-chain was employed to form a pseudo two-dimensional polymer backbone. It is interesting to note that owing to the π–π* electronic transition of the biaxially extended conjugated side-chain groups, the derived polymers exhibited intense absorption in the near-ultraviolet region (300–450 nm), particularly when the targeted polymers consisted of the biaxially extended octithiophene (8T) moiety.

It will thus be of great interest to develop a wide-Eg (∼2.0 eV) 8T-based polymer that possesses an intense and broad absorption covering the short wavelength region, which is greatly complementary to the absorption spectra of both state-of-the-art fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ systems. It should be noted that the homo-polymer consisting of only 8T moiety is difficult to obtain due to the large steric hindrance of its bulky conjugated side-chains. Therefore, a more feasible way to synthesize wide-Eg 8T-based polymers involves copolymerizing 8T with a spacer such as T or TT units; thus, P8TT and P8TTT are accordingly developed, respectively.
Presented in Fig. 1b are the UV-Vis absorption spectra of PC71BM, ITIC, the host polymers (PTB7-Th and PBDB-T), and the studied 8T-based polymers (P8TT and P8TTT); their absorption coefficients are presented in Fig. S1a and b (ESI). In addition to the prominent absorption in the near-ultraviolet region (300–450 nm), the spectra of both 8T-based polymers exhibit an absorption band from 450 to 650 nm, which clearly resulted from the intermolecular interaction (ICT) of the polymer backbone. However, their overall light-harvesting window remains constrained below 650 nm, indicating that the polymers serve as a promising third photoactive component for both the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PBDB-T:ITIC BHJ blends (Fig. 1b). This advantage is also reflected in the UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. S1c and d (ESI), where the absorption in the near-ultraviolet region is clearly higher for the ternary BHJ blends incorporating only a small amount (10 wt% relative to the host polymer) of 8T-based polymers as compared to the pristine binary BHJ blends.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the studied polymers were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using ferrocene as a standard reference, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). The HOMO levels of PTB7-Th, PBDB-T, P8TT, and P8TTT were estimated to be −5.02, −5.00, −5.29, and −5.17 eV, while the corresponding lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level deduced from the optical bandgap is −3.40, −3.21, −3.31, and −3.16 eV, respectively (Table S1, ESI). Plotted in Fig. 2a are the energy level diagrams of the studied ternary BHJ blends, where the energy levels of PCBM and ITIC are cited from the literature.

To testify the potential of using 8T-based polymers in efficient ternary OPVs, photoluminescence (PL) of the binary and ternary blends were compared to probe the improvement in the photoexciton dissociation rate. As shown in Fig. 2b (top), in the fullerene-based BHJ systems, the PL of PTB7-Th exhibited higher quenching degree in the ternary blends upon excitation at 550 nm than in the pristine binary blend. Similar phenomena were also observed in the NFA-based BHJ systems, where the P8TTT-based blends showed higher quenching degree than the P8TT-based blends (Fig. 2b (bottom)). The better PL quenching observed in all the ternary blends suggest the facilitated photoexciton dissociation compared to the pristine binary BHJ blends, which is beneficial for reducing carrier recombination. In principle, the possible reasons for the improved charge dissociation observed in the ternary blends can be correlated to a better cascade energy level or a more optimized morphology. However, in our study, the 8T-based polymers seem to facilitate charge dissociation through the parallel-like BHJ configuration and a more optimized morphology (will be discussed later) in both the fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ, rather than through better cascade energy levels (Fig. 2a).
In addition to facilitating charge dissociation, the wide-Eg third component might enable Förester resonance energy transfer (FRET) to the pristine photoactive components to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency, as mentioned earlier. Fig. S3a and b (ESI) show the superimposition of the UV-vis spectra of PTB7-Th/PBDB-T and the PL spectra of the 8T-based polymers, respectively. As shown in the figures, the emission of the 8T-based polymers (630 nm for P8TT and 616 for P8TTT) can be well absorbed by PTB7-Th/PBDB-T, suggesting the feasible FRET between them. Fig. S3c and d (ESI) compare the PL spectra of the pristine polymer films and the studied blends (PTB7-Th/8T-based polymers (10 wt%) and PBDB-T/8T-based polymers (10 wt%)). As shown in the figures, only emission from the host polymers (765 nm for PTB7-Th and 680 nm for PBDB-T) could be observed for the blends, and the emission from both 8T-based polymers disappeared. This result further confirms the FRET between them, which is beneficial to increase the overall light-harvesting efficiency of the derived ternary BHJ blends.

We next examined the photovoltaic performance of the studied binary/ternary BHJ blends in an inverted structure (see Experimental section). Presented in Fig. 3a and b are their measured J–V curves. The resultant photovoltaic parameters, including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), are summarized in Table 1. As shown, the 8T-based polymers, particularly P8TTT, indeed serve as an active third component (10 wt% to the host polymer) to enhance the performance of both the fullerene- and NFA-based systems. For the fullerene-based system, the P8TTT-based ternary OPV delivered the highest PCE of 9.08% with Voc of 0.802 V, Jsc of 17.26 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.6, while the P8TT-based ternary cell yielded the highest PCE of 8.59% with Voc of 0.811 V, Jsc of 16.81 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.0, thus exceeding the performance (PCE: 8.44%) of the parent binary device. Similarly, for the NFA-based system, the P8TTT-based ternary OPV delivered the highest PCE of 10.01% with Voc of 0.883 V, Jsc of 16.93 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.0, while the P8TT-based ternary cell yielded the highest PCE of 9.45% with Voc of 0.882 V, Jsc of 17.01 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.1, thus outperforming the parent binary device (PCE: 9.39%).

As compared to the parent binary devices, the Voc values of all ternary devices clearly increased owing to the deeper-lying HOMO levels of the 8T-based polymers as compared to the host polymers. In addition, as expected, their Jsc values also increased as a result of the complementary absorption and possible FRET contributed from the 8T-based polymers. To confirm these observations, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the studied devices was measured, and the normalized curves are presented in Fig. 3c and d for comparison. As shown in the figures, the photoresponse contributed from the near-ultraviolet region (300–450 nm) clearly increased, which is in good congruence with the UV-vis absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1b and c. This result clearly validates our hypothesis to increase a device's photocurrent by enhancing the absorption in the near-ultraviolet region by side-chain engineered conjugated polymers.
It is worthy to note that the overall loading amount of 8T-based polymers is limited to 10 wt%. The performance of the ternary OPVs is not clearly enhanced if the loading amount of 8T-based polymers exceeds 10 wt%. Such deficiency might arise from their large bulky side-chain groups, which might be incompatible at the associated interface when the loading amount exceeds a certain threshold. Such a disadvantage reveals the necessity of further side-chain engineering of 8T-based polymers, for example via better side-chain conjugation.

As discussed earlier, the FF of the 8T-based ternary devices showed an evident increase compared to that of the parent binary devices, which might be correlated to the better charge dissociation. However, the P8TT-based devices only yielded FF comparable to that of the parent binary devices. This discrepancy is plausibly correlated to the spacing between the 8T groups, for which the larger spacer between the 8T moieties in P8TTT than in P8TT is more beneficial to the nanoscale phase separation in the blend. It has been acknowledged that FF is a more complicated function of charge kinetics in the device as well as in the nanoscale phase separation of the blends. To better understand the charge recombination behavior in our as-fabricated OPVs, the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) was investigated, and the corresponding plots in double logarithmic coordinates are shown in Fig. 3e and f for the fullurene- and NFA-based systems, respectively. It should be noted that Jph is calculated from Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current densities measured under AM1.5G illumination and in the dark, respectively, while Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero, and Vbias is the applied bias.

In principle, at the high bias region, Jph reaches a saturation current density (Jsat), representing the condition that charges are fully dissociated and swept by the high internal electric field. Therefore, the charge dissociation probability can be evaluated by the ratio of Jph/Jsat under different external biases. For example, at Veff = 0.1 eV, the estimated charge dissociation probability for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM, P8TT-, and P8TTT-based ternary devices was 0.49, 0.55, and 0.63, respectively, while the obtained values for the PBDB-T:ITIC, P8TT-, and P8TTT-based ternary devices are 0.56, 0.59, and 0.74, respectively. As shown, all the ternary OPVs, particularly the P8TTT-based devices, exhibited better charge dissociation than the parent binary devices, confirming the facilitated photoexciton dissociation in the ternary blends. This result suggests that the large bulky side-chain groups can still possess good miscibility with the parent components when its blending ratio is within the optimized value.

The morphology of the blends was next investigated to understand the crucial role that the molecular order/disorder structural interdigitation of the BHJ films plays in device performance. The molecular packing features and stacking orientations of the studied BHJ films were first investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and Fig. 4a depicts their two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns. For the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend, a clear (100) peak was observed in the in-plane direction, corresponding to the lamellar packing of PTB7-Th. Moreover, a ring signal at q = ∼1.3 Å−1 is attributed to the PC71BM aggregates. As for the PBDB-T:ITIC blend, a (100) lamellar diffraction signal of PBDB-T was similarly observed in both the binary and ternary blends. It should be noted that there is no noticeable change after adding 8T-based polymers (10 wt% relative to the PTB7-Th or PBDB-T) into the blend.

To better understand the morphology, the one-dimensional (1D) profile extracted from the 2D pattern, the full width half-maximum (FWHM) of the (100) peak, and the pole plot of the (100) signal were subsequently analyzed. Fig. 4b and c present the detailed crystallographic properties of the studied blends, and their relevant crystallographic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI). For the PTB7-Th:PC71BM BHJ film (left in Fig. 4b), the diffraction peak at qy = 0.30 Å−1 is assigned to the (100) signal of PTB7-Th with a lamellar packing spacing of 20.9 Å, while the peaks at qy = 0.59 Å−1 and 1.34 Å−1 are attributed to PC71BM. These ordering features are comparable to that of X-ray characteristics in literatures. The molecular packing features of PTB7-Th in the ternary blends were further investigated, and both the FWHM as well as the azimuthal-angle pole plot analyses were applied to its (100) peak. As shown, similar crystallite size (∼8 nm) and packing orientation were observed, indicating the inter-chain organization of PTB7-Th was not greatly interfered by P8TT or P8TTT.
Similar crystallographic behaviors were observed for the PBDB-T:ITIC BHJ film (Fig. 4c). The lamellar packing distance of PBDB-T is estimated to be 21.7 Å (corresponding diffraction signal at qy = 0.29 Å−1), and the (010) peak of ITIC is detected at qz = 1.56 Å−1 (Fig. S4, ESI). Similar to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM case, the stacking ordering (crystallite size of ∼9 nm) of PBDB-T is maintained in the ternary blends. However, it is worthwhile to notice that its packing orientation is slightly improved after blending with the 8T-based polymers, which might facilitate charge transport in the ternary blends. This result thus suggests a compromise between the loading amount of 8T-based polymers in the ternary blends and the large size of its side-chain groups. The hindrance effect arising from the bulky side-chain group of 8T-polymer can be relieved by optimizing its loading amount in the ternary blend or via better side-chain design.
The morphology of these studied blends was then investigated by TEM. Presented in Fig. 5a and b are the TEM images of the parent binary blends. For both the fullerene- and NFA-based systems, larger fibrillar structures were observed in the ternary blends (Fig. 5c, e and d, f), which might afford more homogenous pathways for charge transport and dissociation at the associated D/A interface. Moreover, the surface energy of the studied BHJ blends was investigated to understand whether there are any surface textural changes in the ternary blend. The CA of each individual component was first measured to assess the surface energies via the Owen–Wendt model. For the fullerene-based system, the estimated surface energy of the pristine PTB7-Th was 43.28 mJ m−2 (Table S3, ESI), while the surface energy of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend was 33.23 mJ m−2. However, after adding P8TT and P8TFT, the surface energies of the blends drastically enhanced to 44.08 mJ m−2 and 50.06 mJ m−2, respectively, validating the distribution of 8T-based polymers at the pristine PTB7-Th/PC71BM interfaces. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the NFA-based systems. Combing these results, the positive role that the P8TT and P8TFT play in the ternary blend in promoting efficient charge generation, transport, and dissociation was verified.

In this study, we proved the effectiveness of wide-Eg polymers based on biaxially extended 8T-based alternating copolymers as an efficient third component to improve the performance of both fullerene- and NFA-based BHJ systems. Owing to its unique biaxially extended conjugated side-chain groups, the derived 8T-based polymers show intense absorption in the near-ultraviolet region. By further tailoring the polymer backbone with p-type moieties (T and TT), wide-Eg (∼2.0 eV) polymers (P8TT and P8TTT) with absorption wavelengths below 650 nm were prepared, showing very complementary absorption to the spectra of the state-of-the-art BHJ systems. By providing suitable energy levels, P8TTT was demonstrated to induce a 7.58% and 6.60% enhancement in PCE for the derived PTB7-TH:PC71BM and PBDB-T:ITIC ternary blends with only a small loading amount (10 wt%). This study manifests a new perspective in wide-Eg material design for realizing efficient ternary BHJ systems.
