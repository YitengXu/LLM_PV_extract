Five wide or medium band gap diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated polymers with pyridine as bridges were developed for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs). By introducing copolymerized aromatic building blocks from strong electron-donating units to electron-deficient units into the conjugated backbone, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the DPP polymers were tailored to the low-lying position. Therefore, the polarity of charge transport in OFETs can be switched from p-type to n-type. The DPP polymer with a low-lying LUMO of −3.80 eV provides a hole-only mobility of 2.95 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, while an electron-only mobility of 1.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is found in the DPP polymer with a LUMO of −4.22 eV. Further investigation of photovoltaic cells based on these DPP polymers shows a modest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 2%. Our results demonstrate that wide band gap pyridine-bridged DPP polymers have potential application in OFETs and OSCs by adjusting their energy level with alternated units on the conjugated backbone.

Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based conjugated polymers have been intensively investigated for their application in organic electronics, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs), since 2008. DPP derivatives were prepared from aromatic nitriles with succinic acid diesters, where aromatic units as a bridge have a crucial influence on the properties of DPP polymers. Thienyl-bridged DPP polymers are mostly reported with high hole and electron mobilities above 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs and PCE up to 8% in PSCs. Analogues of thiophene, such as thienothiophene, selenophene, furan and thiazole, were also applied as bridges for DPP polymers to show promising performance in OFETs and PSCs. Electron donating thiophene and its analogue as a bridge combined with a strong electron deficient DPP core easily provide DPP polymers near-infrared absorption up to 1000 nm, which is especially beneficial for tandem and multi-junction solar cells. In another aspect, DPP polymers show excellent crystallinity and high charge carrier mobilities that make them interesting to be explored as wide band gap polymers for OFETs and PSCs, but related polymers are rarely studied.

Conjugated polymers alternating with an electron donor and an electron acceptor are widely reported toward tunable absorption spectra and the energy level via internal charge transfer. A DPP core with a strong electron deficient ability requires weak donating units to form a wide band gap polymer. When thienyl-bridged DPP polymers are copolymerized with weak donors, such as biphenyl units, carbazole and fluorene derivatives, the absorption onset of DPP polymers can be tuned to around 750 nm. Further blue-shifted absorption spectra to the visible region for DPP polymers desire the modification of bridges with a weak donating ability compared to thiophene. Phenyl-bridged DPP polymers as wide band gap materials are widely reported for the application of pigment, photo- or electron-luminescence, but show poor performance in OFETs and PSCs (lower than 2%). The dihedral angle between the phenyl unit and the DPP core of around 30° makes the twist conjugated backbone of DPP polymers that will influence the crystallinity and charge transport.
The dihedral angle of phenyl-bridged DPP units originated from the adjacent H atom on the phenyl unit and the methyl group attached to the amide of the DPP core, which can be eliminated via replacing benzene by pyridine. Wide band gap DPP polymers can be made with pyridine as the bridge due to its similar donating ability to benzene. In addition, the electron-withdrawing amine group (CN) at the pyridine unit also helps DPP polymers achieve deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels that are especially beneficial for high open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs. Pyridine-bridged DPP polymers have been reported for high electron mobilities of 6.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OFETs and PSCs with a PCE of 4.9%. It will be useful to further explore the pyridine-bridged DPP polymers for application in OFETs and PSCs.
In this work, we systematically design and synthesis a series of pyridine-bridged DPP polymers alternating with a variety of different aromatic units (Fig. 1). All the polymers have wide or medium band gaps (1.41–1.85 eV), and their HOMO and LUMO levels were increased by reducing the electron donating ability or increasing the electron withdrawing ability of alternating aromatic units. PDPP2Py2oT with the strongly donating dimethyoxy-bithiophene (2oT) has low LUMO and HOMO levels of −3.87 eV and −5.28 eV, show p-type OFETs. When using weak donors such as benzodithiophene (BDT) and thiophene (T), PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT show ambipolar OFETs. Further increasing HOMO and LUMO levels can be realized by introducing the electron withdrawing benzothiadiazole (BTD) and naphthadiimide (NDI) into DPP polymers. PDPP2PyNDI has the deepest LUMO and HOMO levels (−4.22 eV and −6.07 eV) with n-type OFETs. Pyridine-bridged DPP polymers were also applied in PSCs with PCE up to 2.4%. We demonstrate that by modifying the molecular polarity of copolymerized units on the conjugated backbone of DPP polymers, the energy level and polarity of charge transport can be varied and hence influence their properties in OFETs and PSCs.

All synthetic procedures were performed under a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. Commercial chemicals were used as received. THF and toluene were distilled from sodium under an N2 atmosphere and benzophenone was used as the indicator. [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) was purchased from Solenne BV. The monomer 4,9-dibromo-2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone, (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (4), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (5) and 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (6) were purchased from Sunatech Inc. and recrystallized for polymerization. 3,6-Bis(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (1) and (3,3′-dimethoxy-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (2) were synthesized according to literature procedures.


1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz on a Bruker ANACE spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The molecular weight of DPP polymers was determined with GPC at 140 °C on a PL-GPC 220 system using a PL-GEL 10 μm MIXED-B column and ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as the eluent against polystyrene standards. A low concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 polymer in o-DCB was applied to reduce aggregation. Electronic spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed under an inert atmosphere with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and 1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in o-DCB as the electrolyte. The working, counter and reference electrodes were glassy carbon, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl, respectively. The concentration of the sample in the electrolyte was approximately 1 mM, based on monomers. All potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in reflection mode at 40 kV and 200 mA with Cu Kα radiation using a 2 kW Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were conducted using XEUSS SAXS/WAXS equipment. Density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory by using the Gaussian 09 program package. Atom force microscopy (AFM) images of films were obtained by using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIa Multimode atomic force microscope in tapping mode.
Organic field-effect transistors were fabricated using heavily doped silicon wafers as the common gate electrode with a 300 nm thermally oxidized SiO2 layer which was modified by OTS as the gate dielectric. Electrodes of Au (25 nm) were vacuum deposited first and then polymer thin films were spin coated on the substrate from o-DCB or chloroform solution with a thickness of around 30–50 nm, and then moved into a glovebox filled with N2. After thermal annealing at the corresponding temperature, the devices were measured on an Agilent B1500 semiconductor parameter analyzer at room temperature.
Photovoltaic devices were made by spin coating poly-(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P, VP AI 4083) onto precleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (15 Ω per square). The photoactive layer was deposited by spin coating a chloroform solution containing the polymers and [70]PCBM with a 1:2 (w/w) ratio and appropriate amounts of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) or o-DCB. Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited by vacuum evaporation at ∼1 × 10−5 Pa as the back electrode. The active area of the cells was 0.04 cm2. An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) coupled with AM 1.5 G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the devices was conducted using a computer-controlled Agilent B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

The route for pyridine-bridged DPP polymers is shown in Scheme 1. PDPP2Py2oT was prepared by Stille polymerization with a bis(bromopyridinyl)-DPP monomer and a bisstannyl-bismethyloxy-bithiophene (2oT) monomer. Octyldodecyl (OD) side chains were applied to provide enough solubility for the polymer. A catalyst system based on Pd2(dba)3 as a source of palladium with PPh3 as a ligand combined with the reaction solvent of toluene/DMF was used to achieve an optimized molecular weight. PDPP2PyBDT with benzodithiophene (BDT) and PDPP2PyT with thiophene (T) were also made via Stille polymerization with similar conditions to PDPP2Py2oT. For PDPP2PyNDI with electron withdrawing naphthadiimide (NDI), CuI was added into Stille polymerization to achieve high molecular weight. We observed that the polymerization would not progress if CuI is absent. PDPP2PyBTD was polymerized by Suzuki polycondensation with Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst at 80 °C. The molecular weight of DPP polymers was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as an eluent. The GPC column was held at 140 °C and the polymer concentration was 0.1 mg ml−1 to reduce the aggregation of polymers. These polymers show a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 15.1–75.4 kg mol−1 but a high polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.39–6.63 (Table 1), so the number molecular weight (Mn) is modest (6.1–24.5 kg mol−1). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), low Mn and high PDI were quite different from thienyl-bridged DPP polymers. This is probably due to the low reaction activity of dibromo-pyridine-bridged DPP monomers.

The DPP polymers show red-shifted absorption spectra in thin films (Fig. 2a) compared to those in chloroform solution (Table 1 and Fig. S2, ESI), indicating aggregation. PDPP2Py2oT with strong donating 2oT units showed near-infrared absorption spectra with the absorption onset at 880 nm and an optical band gap (Eg) of 1.41 eV. Other pyridine-bridged DPP polymers show a similar wide band gap with an Eg of 1.75–1.85 eV. It is desired to mention that PDPP2PyBTD and PDPP2PyNDI with electron withdrawing BTD and NDI units show large band gaps of 1.76 eV and 1.85 eV. In comparison, their thienyl-bridged DPP polymers PDPP2TBT and PNDI-DPP have low band gaps of 1.19 eV and 1.15 eV. This huge difference indicates the great influence of pyridine as a bridge on their physical properties.

The energy levels of DPP polymers were determined using cyclic voltammetry in o-DCB solutions (Fig. 2b and Table 1). When the electron donating ability decreased or the electron withdrawing ability increased, DPP polymers show increased HOMO and LUMO levels. PDPP2Py2oT has LUMO and HOMO levels of −3.80 eV and −5.21 eV. The low HOMO level will help hole injection in OFETs but also reduce Voc in PSCs. PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT with BDT and T as donors show a similar LUMO level but a high HOMO level that is beneficial for high Voc in PSCs. PDPP2PyBTD with electron withdrawing BTD units provides a LUMO level of −4.01 eV and a HOMO level of −5.77 eV. Further increase of LUMO and HOMO levels is realized by using NDI as a building block, in which PDPP2PyNDI shows a LUMO level of −4.22 eV and HOMO level of −6.07 eV. The LUMO and HOMO levels of PDPP2PyNDI are similar to fullerene derivatives, indicating its potential application as a non-fullerene electron acceptor for polymer–polymer solar cells. The great variation of energy levels induced by copolymerized aromatic units would influence their electronic properties in OFETs and PSCs.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level were performed for extended oligomers based on these DPP polymers. In the DFT calculations methyl units were used to replace long alkyl chains in order to reduce the calculation time. Deep HOMO and LUMO levels were achieved from a 2oT-based oligomer to a NDI-based oligomer (Fig. 3), which has a similar trend to the measured energy levels of DPP polymers. For PDPP2Py2oT, PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT with electron donating units, HOMO and LUMO orbitals are delocalized over the conjugated backbone. However, the HOMO levels of PDPP2PyBTD and PDPP2PyNDI are mainly delocalized over the DPP core and the LUMO levels are mainly delocalized over the BTD or NDI units. The dihedral angle between aromatic units and neighboring pyridine units is around 20° for PDPP2Py2oT, PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT. The dihedral angle was greatly increased to 38.20° for PDPP2PyBTD and 59.33° for PDPP2PyNDI (Fig. S3, ESI).
Molecular stacking of DPP polymers was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the polymer thin films (Fig. 4 and S4, ESI). All the pure polymer films drop casted from chloroform solutions displayed diffraction peaks (Fig. S4, ESI) and the intensity of these peaks are increased after thermal annealing of thin films at 150 °C (Fig. 4). The polymers show strong (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.25° (PDPP2Py2oT), 4.31° (PDPP2PyBDT), 4.48° (PDPP2PyBTD) and 4.61° (PDPP2PyNDI). PDPP2PyT showed weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.71°. The lamellar d-spacings are 1.87–2.08 nm (Fig. 4). PDPP2PyBTD and PDPP2PyNDI showed large dihedral angles (38.20° and 59.33°) on the conjugated backbone (Fig. S3, ESI), but they still showed good crystallinity with d-spacings of 1.97 nm and 1.92 nm. PDPP2PyBDT also showed a weak and broad peak (010) at an angle of 24.21°, corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 0.37 nm. For the other polymers, the (010) peak is too weak to be observed. GIWAXS was also applied to investigate the crystal behaviour of the polymers in thin films (Fig. S5, ESI), showing that most of the polymers perform the diffraction in the small angle region (0.3–0.4 Å) in the in-plane and out-of-plane direction that corresponds to the stacking of alkyl side chains.

Charge carrier mobility of the DPP polymers was determined in a bottom gate–bottom contact FET configuration. A highly n-doped Si wafer with a SiO2 layer which contained strip gold electrodes was passivated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayers. DPP polymers dissolved in chloroform or o-DCB were spin-coated on the substrates and moved into the glovebox with N2. After annealing at the corresponding temperature, the devices were measured at room temperature. Representative transfer curves are shown in Fig. 5. The mobility (μ) in the saturated region and the threshold voltage (VT) were calculated using the following equation:
IDS = (W/2L)Ciμ(VG − VT)2

W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, Ci is the unit dimensional dielectric capacitance of the gate insulator, μ is the field-effect mobility, and VT is the threshold voltage.

All devices exhibit very high on/off ratios (Ion/off: 105–107). VT is around −20 to −30 V for hole mobilities and 20–60 V for electron mobilities. PDPP2Py2oT only exhibits a hole mobility (μh) of 2.95 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 2). OFETs based on PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT with weakly donating building blocks show typical ambipolar transfer characteristics (Fig. 5b and c). PDPP2PyBDT exhibited a higher μh of 2.60 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to its electron mobility (μe) of 2.67 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, PDPP2PyT showed higher μe of 1.34 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the μh of 1.65 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The trend of increased electron mobility and reduced hole mobility was probably due to increased LUMO and HOMO levels of DPP polymers. A deep LUMO level would help electron injection from the gold electrodes but a deep HOMO level is not beneficial for hole injection. Further enhancement of LUMO and HOMO levels for PDPP2PyBTD and PDPP2PyNDI provides the polymers only electron mobilities of around 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. OFETs clearly showed that modification of polymer structures by introducing building blocks with different electron-donating or withdrawing abilities can effectively tune the energy level and hole or electron mobilities.

Pyridine-bridged DPP polymers as an electron donor blended with [70]PCBM as an electron acceptor were further applied to photovoltaic devices, sandwiched between the transparent ITO/PEDOT:PSS front and the reflecting Ca/Al back electrodes. The photoactive layers composed of DPP polymers and [70]PCBM were carefully optimized with respect to the ratio of the donor to the acceptor, the solvent with an additive and the layer thickness. PDPP2PyBTD and PDPP2PyNDI based cells have no photovoltaic effect due to their deep LUMO levels, which induced a low driving force for charge separation from the donor to the acceptor.

The J–V characteristics of PDPP2Py2oT, PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT based cells are presented in Fig. 6 and the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 3. In general, photoactive layers based on DPP-polymer:[70]PCBM for optimized cells were spin coated from a chloroform solution with 5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive and the ratio of the donor to the acceptor was 1:2. When using 1-CN or o-DCB as an additive, the solar cells provided lower PCEs (Table S1). PDPP2Py2oT with the high-lying HOMO level showed a low Voc of 0.53 V, and PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT showed a high Voc of 0.86 V and 0.79 V due to their deep HOMO levels. All these cells gave a modest short circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.7–5.0 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.54–0.64. Therefore, the PCE based on DPP-polymer:[70]PCBM cells is 1.4% (PDPP2Py2oT), 2.2% (PDPP2PyBDT) and 2.4% (PDPP2PyT), which is much less than that for thienyl-bridged DPP polymers. The low PCE is mainly attributed to their low Jsc that also can be seen from their external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 6b). PDPP2Py2oT:[70]PCBM cells showed a low EQE (<0.1) contributed by the absorption of the polymer. PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT based cells also gave EQE lower than 0.35 in their absorption region. We also synthesized OD-PDPP2PyT with longer OD side chains so as to achieve high Mn = 39.9 kg mol−1 and PDI = 3.76 compared to the polymer with HD units (Scheme S1), but the devices based on OD-PDPP2PyT provide a very poor PCE of 0.43% (Table S2). The results confirm the previous observation that DPP polymers with longer side chains yield low efficiency solar cells.

Low photon-conversion into electron efficiency based on these pyridine-bridged DPP polymers is desired to be discussed. It has been reported that in thienyl-bridged DPP polymer based photovoltaic cells, energy loss (ELoss = Eg − eVoc) between band gaps of the donor polymer to Voc has a great influence on the EQE of devices. In these pyridine-bridged DPP polymer solar cells, ELoss was calculated to be 0.88 eV (PDPP2Py2oT), 0.89 eV (PDPP2PyBDT) and 0.97 eV (PDPP2PyT) that should be enough for exciton separation into free carriers. The poor EQE and PCE in these cells may originate from the poor phase separation between the polymer and [70]PCBM as shown in Fig. 7. In the AFM height image of photoactive layers, a large domain can be found in these polymer:[70]PCBM systems, indicating that the exciton has difficulty in diffusion into the interface of the donor and the acceptor. In addition, it should also be noted that the relatively low molecular weight of these pyridine-bridged DPP polymers indicates a possible defect on the conjugated backbone, such as the homo-coupling segment, which is detrimental to the photovoltaic device's performance. A further study of the optimization of polymerization conditions to achieve high molecular weight pyridine-bridged DPP polymers will be necessary to improve the PCE of photovoltaic cells.

A series of conjugated polymers with DPP as the core and pyridine as the bridge were designed and synthesized, where alternating building blocks from the electron donor to the electron acceptor were introduced. A strong electron donating unit, such as bimethoxy-dithiophene, was incorporated into DPP polymers with a low band gap of 1.41 eV. DPP polymers containing weak donors or electron acceptors as building blocks show wide band gaps of around 1.8 eV. The HOMO and LUMO levels of DPP polymers were influenced by incorporating building blocks, following the trends from strong donors to weak donors and electron acceptors. Therefore, the polarity of charge transport in OFETs can be varied from p-type for PDPP2Py2oT with strong donors to ambipolar behaviour for PDPP2PyBDT and PDPP2PyT alternating with weak donors and n-type for DPP polymers with electron withdrawing units. Further investigation of photovoltaic devices based on these polymers showed a modest PCE of 1.4–2.4% due to their low external quantum efficiency. The results show that the energy level and charge transport properties of conjugated polymers, from hole-only to ambipolar and electron-only transport, can be effectively tuned via copolymerized building blocks. Further investigation on improving the molecular weight is also needed for pyridine-bridged DPP polymers toward high performance photovoltaic devices.
