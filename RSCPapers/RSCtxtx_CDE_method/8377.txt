Hybrid organic inorganic perovskite (HOIP) semiconductors can be used to fabricate thin film solar cells with high solar power conversion efficiencies. The stability of HOIP solar cells depends strongly on the hole and electron transport layers that encapsulate the semiconductor and prevent reactions with metallic electrodes. A series of fused perylene diimide-based compounds with varying degrees of sulfur annulation (2PDI, 2PDI-2S, 2PDI-3S, and 2PDI-4S) were examined as electron transport layers in methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) solar cells. The sulfur annulation alters not only the electron affinity of the ETL, but also the chemical interaction with the MAPbI3 layer, resulting in unusually long lifetimes for this class of devices. Devices with 2PDI-4S, which contain two disulfide bridges, as an ETL show little degradation of the power conversion efficiency after 400 hours during solar illumination at the maximum power point, thus exceeding the performance of fullerene ETLs under long time operation.

The last decade has witnessed an appreciable improvement in the performance of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite photovoltaics (HOIP PVs), which now reach power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24% in lab-scale cells and 19% in mini-modules. HOIPs comprise of materials with an ABX3 structure, where A is a cation, B is a divalent metal and X is a halide. Efficient solar cells have been formed from methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and structurally similar alloys with varying cations on the A site, such as cesium or formamidinium, and/or halides such as bromide. HOIPs can be grown from solution at low temperatures (<200 °C) via conventional coating processes, such as blade or slot-die coating, on both solid and flexible substrates. The development of complementary solution-processable materials for transport layers and encapsulation is important for improving the performance and lifetime of HOIP solar cells.

We report a study here of organic acceptors for electron transport layers (ETLs) for HOIP solar cells. These acceptors are a series of PDI dimers with a varying number of annulated sulfur atoms named 2PDI-nS (n = 2, 3 and 4) (Fig. 1a). The number of fused sulfurs bridging the bay positions of the PDI cores tunes the EA of the compounds resulting in compounds with varying EAs (3.7, 3.9, and 4.0 eV for 2PDI-2S, 2PDI-3S, and 2PDI-4S, respectively) and a deep IE (∼5.9 eV) (Fig. 1b). The comparable molecular structure, but varying degree of sulfur-atom substitution, allowed us to reveal the benefit of disulfide substitution in organic ETLs on the long-term operational stability of inverted solar cells of methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3).
The typical device structure of an HOIP PV has hole and electron transport layers (HTLs and ETLs) that sandwich the HOIP layer in a p–i–n heterostructure. Here p and n refer to the dominant carrier type and do not necessarily mean that the HTL and ETL are intentionally doped. The design of the HTL and ETL is important to allow selective extraction of holes, or electrons, to the electrodes while also minimizing surface recombination to reduce energetic losses in the solar cell. The choice of ETL and HTL is also affected by the solar cell fabrication process, i.e. whether or not the material can be cast onto the chemically fragile HOIP layer. Many reports of efficient HOIP PVs have used organic materials as the HTL because these are easy to solution-process and can be tuned to line-up energetically to different HOIP materials. Inorganic oxides, such as TiO2, have been widely used as ETLs where they are cast prior to the HOIP layer, but can necessitate high curing temperatures (∼500 °C) from solution-based precursors. Such high temperatures, however, are not compatible with polymer based flexible substrates (i.e. PET and PEN) and some materials for transparent electrodes (i.e. indium tin oxide, ITO), thereby restricting its applicability and limiting possible device structures. In addition, metal oxide ETLs can be challenging to deposit onto some HOIP layers because of degradation that can occur during curing of the oxide layer at temperatures above the decomposition point of the HOIP.
Soluble organic semiconductors are promising materials for ETLs in HOIP PVs. Many organic semiconductors designed for n-type charge transport, or as acceptors in organic photovoltaics, already have the desired characteristics for HOIP ETLs. Organic ETLs that have proven successful in HOIP PVs typically have electron affinities (EAs) between 3.6 and 4.2 eV, a good match for efficient extraction of electrons from MAPbI3 and its alloys, whose conduction band lies near 3.9 eV with respect to vacuum. Organic semiconductors also have ionization energies (IEs) that are deep enough to block holes (>5.5 eV) and electron mobilities (>10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) that can be improved with n-dopants. Among them, fullerene derivatives, especially phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), naphthalene-based polymers such as (P(NDIOD-T2)), and perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have been studied as ETLs with or without n-type dopants. These organic ETLs are usually cast onto the HOIP layer and the resulting device structure is referred to as inverted with respect to a device whose ETL was cast before the HOIP layer.
A significant question for organic ETLs is whether they can lead to devices with long lifetimes required for practical solar cells. The initial PCE of planar p–i–n MAPbI3 devices with PCBM ETLs is ∼18%, yet these have been reported to have poor stability under air exposure and light soaking, likely due to oxygen or water absorption leading to reductions in PCE by nearly a factor of 2 over ∼100 h of testing. Ethylhexyl-substituted PDI ETLs in inverted structure HOIP-PVs have been reported to be relatively stable when tested by light-soaking and dark storage compared to PCBM. They observed less decomposition of MAPbI3 into PbI2 and less generation of AgI at the top Ag electrode, and thus concluded that suppression of diffusion of methylammonium iodide through the PDI layer played a critical role in increasing the stability of the device. The addition of 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) as an additional layer between fullerene ETLs, such as PCBM and C60, and the metal electrode has helped to reduce degradation from contact of the metal and HOIP layer. Overall these results suggest that it is possible to improve the lifetimes of solar cells with organic ETLs, but molecular design rules that lead to stability are still lacking.
To study the role of molecular structure on the performance of inverted MAPbI3 PVs, we examine a series of twisted core di-PDI acceptors with varying sulfur annulation, 2PDI-nS (n = 0, 2, 3 and 4). Due to the twisted core of the fused PDI dimers, the compounds all form glassy or weakly ordered films by spin-coating providing comparable morphologies, yet having varying electronic levels. These compounds were shown to be effective non-fullerene acceptors in bulk heterojunction solar cells. The charge carrier mobility, based on field effect transistor measurements and time-resolved microwave conductivity, for the 2PDI-4S was comparable to PCBM suggesting that it could act as an effective ETL for HOIP PVs. Here we compare the performance of the 2PDI-nS series to PCBM and find that the addition of disulfide groups extends the lifetime of the solar cells under operational testing.

To study the properties of the 2PDI-nS series as ETLs, we examined planar MAPbI3 solar cells with an inverted structure. The materials used in the device are glass/ITO/polytriarylamine (PTAA, ∼5 nm, Aldrich)/MAPbI3 (∼400 nm)/ETL/polyethyleneimine (PEIE, 80% ethoxylated, Aldrich)/Ag (80 nm) (Fig. 2a). PTAA was chosen for the HTL because it has an IE of –5.1 eV and it induces relatively large grains in the MAPbI3 active layer due to its hydrophobicity. All four 2PDI-nS materials form uniform films on MAPbI3 based on atomic force microscopy (Fig. S1, ESI). A PEIE layer was used to improve the electric contact between the ETL and the top electrode; PEIE reduces the work function of Ag from ca. 4.7 eV to 3.8 eV and may also donate electrons from its amino groups to the surface of ETL All of the fabrication processes and measurements were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere.

The 2PDI-nS ETLs behaved similarly to PCBM with MAPbI3 in as-deposited cells, but have significant differences upon thermal annealing. The 2PDI-nS devices all show a boost in PCE upon thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Due to increases in fill factor (FF) and short-circuit currents (JSC) up to ∼20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2, Fig. S2, S3 (ESI) and Table 1; the statistical variation in the parameters are shown in Fig. 2d, e and Fig. S4, S5, ESI) The PCE increases by 50%, 90%, 42%, and 4% for 2PDI-nS, where n = 0–4, respectively. In contrast, PCBM-containing devices exhibit decreases in both FF and JSC leading to an overall 30% drop in PCE under identical annealing conditions (Fig. 2a, b and Table 1). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices with the 2PDI-nS ETLs (Fig. 2c) are all almost identical except for the variation in magnitude. The calculated JSC based on the IPCE data are 18.4, 20.7, 19.1, 20.4, 21.5 mA cm−2 for PCBM, 2PDI-0S, 2PDI-2S, 2PDI-3S, 2PDI-4S, respectively, which agree with those obtained from the J–V characteristics under 1 sun illumination. Overall, the 2PDI-nS compounds benefit from the annealing process which can be attributed to improved carrier transport and extraction and thus leading to higher JSC and FFs.

The difference in performance of the 2PDI-nS ETLs is more strongly related to the electron mobility of the materials rather than the EA. The J–V characteristics of the devices without PEIE layer for the 2PDI-nS series, as well as PCBM, show a significant S-kink around the VOC (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI). The addition of PEIE eliminates the S-kink either by doping the ETL or significantly modifying the energetic line-up with the Ag electrode through interfacial dipoles. In both cases the differences in the VOC of the devices is less than 0.1 V which is significantly smaller than the difference in the EAs of the acceptors (∼0.3 eV). The trend in FF as a function of sulfur substitution does follow the reported trend in electron mobility for the series with 2PDI-4S having the highest mobility. The PVs with 2PDI-4S as an ETL, however, still underperform those with PCBM despite the material having a comparable electron mobility to PCBM.
The performance of the solar cells provide insight into the interfacial contact between the 2PDI-nS and MAPbI3. Some organic semiconductors are known to passivate the defects at the HOIP surface by Lewis acid/base chemistry or by supplying relevant halogen ions to the vacancy sites, resulting in an increase in photoluminescence lifetime (decrease of recombination), diminishing the notorious hysteresis in the J–V characteristics and increasing the PCE. PCBM, for example, has been suggested to behave as a Lewis acid that accepts excess negative charges at the Pb–I antisite. In all our 2PDI-nS devices, we do not see notable hysteresis in the J–V characteristics (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI), showing that the compounds are passivating the surface of MAPbI3. To further elucidate the response of the devices, transient photocurrents (TPCs) were measured at the short-circuit condition (Fig. S8, ESI). All of the photo-currents show rapid (<1 s) response upon turning the 1 sun illumination on or off with no obvious long time-scale ionic or capacitive contribution. The traces also show no immediate degradation in these devices with a stable current during ∼95 s of continuous light illumination.

We obtained time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to further examine the role of the EA of the ETL at the interface with MAPbI3. TRPL was collected with a low excitation fluence of ∼0.05 μJ cm−2 that sets a carrier concentration where monomolecular recombination is expected to dominate the decay (Fig. 3). The lifetime at short timescales of the neat MAPbI3 film, obtained by fitting the decay with a double exponential model, is 11.6 ns (Table 2). When the MAPbI3 layer is covered by PCBM, 2PDI-0S, or 2PDI-2S, the decay lifetime is greatly reduced at short timescales to ∼1 ns, indicating that electron transfer between the two layers is highly efficient. The bilayers with 2PDI-3S and 2PDI-4S show even shorter lifetimes (∼0.5 ns) and very little change in the decay at longer timescales compared to the neat MAPbI3 film. The overall trend is that the PL decays faster as the EA of the ETL increases, as observed for many undoped organic materials. The observed “jump” in decay lifetime between 2PDI-0/2S and 2PDI-3/4S also agrees with the slightly lower VOC observed in the PVs without PEIE. We note that the quenching is a non-radiative loss pathway for the photogenerated carriers due to surface recombination—the carriers generated in MAPbI3 are recombining at surface states in MAPbI3 or recombining directly between the ETL and MAPbI3. The VOC of the devices here upon doping with PEIE, ∼1 V, are lower than the VOC in the best MAPbI3 solar cells of 1.26 V and can be attributed in part to surface recombination and also differences in the Pb precursors used to grow the MAPbI3 layer (PbI2 here vs. lead acetate Pb(CH3COO)2 in the cited work).

A surprising feature of the use of 2PDI-nS as an ETL is the dramatic improvement in lifetimes of the solar cells compared to PCBM. We examined the stability of solar cells with the two best-performing ETLs using under continuous 1 sun illumination at 35 °C. During the illumination, the cells were connected to a resistor of 220 Ω to keep the cells operated at the maximum power. The lifetime test was started in a couple of days after the device fabrication were completed and encapsulated in nitrogen. We set time zero within 10 min after the devices were placed in the light soaking chamber. These lifetime tests showed that as-deposited 2PDI-0S and 2PDI-4S-based devices are significantly more stable than ones using PCBM (Fig. 4 and Fig. S9, ESI). The PCBM-based device has a higher initial PCE of 17%, but shows a rapid and monotonic degradation to 2% PCE within 300 h driven by a large decrease in JSC. The operational lifetime is consistent with the values from literatures on MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag devices (Table S1, ESI). In contrast, 2PDI-0S and 2PDI-4S-based devices show an increase in PCE to ∼14% in the first 30 h. This behavior differs from observations of a fast burn-in followed by a slower decay observed in some HOIP PVs. The increase in PCE is likely due to the same mechanism as that afforded by thermal annealing because both are mainly driven by the improvement of the FF. The PCE of the 2PDI-0S device then gradually falls mainly due to decrease in the FF, while that of the 2PDI-4S device shows a gradual increase before it plateaus after ∼100 h and remains nearly constant until the end of the experiment at 400 hours. This increase in FF compensates for the slow decrease in JSC (Fig. 4). While it is difficult to compare long term stability across reports in literature because many only provide shelf-life stability, the operational stability of the devices with 2PDI-4S are comparable to best devices in literature that incorporate both metal oxide layers and an organic ETL (Table 3).

Our results suggest a chemical pathway to the improvement in stability of MAPbI3 solar cells using ETLs. Apart from the instability of MA in MAPbI3, which can be addressed by substituting alternative A-site cations, the main degradation mechanism of MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag devices is known to be the corrosion of the silver electrode by iodides migrated from MAPbI3 through the ETL as confirmed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Improvement in lifetimes of HOIP solar cells have been achieved by incorporating additional cations and halogens to stabilize the HOIP layer (formamidinium, Cs), inserting a protective metal oxide layer (Ti(Nb)Ox, CeOx) between the ETL and the electrode, passivating the surface of MAPbI3, employing a non-halogen-corrosive material (ITO) as the electrode, or adopting a non-fullerene organic semiconductor (NFA) as the ETL to reduce halogen migration rate (Table 3). Our findings indicate that switching to 2PDI instead of PCBM increases the lifetime of MAPbI3 solar cells and that the addition of disulfide bridges to 2PDI yields a further improvement in the stability during light-soaking at the maximum power point. Annulating two sulfur atoms creates a disulfide bridge with electron-rich sulfur atoms directing electron density to the periphery of the PDI core. The disulfides increase the EA of 2PDI-4S to 4.0 eV, within the electrochemical window of water and should help to stabilize the carriers in the ETL itself under operation. Disulfide bridges also form reversible redox states with free thiols, thereby increasing their reductive stability, which is paramount for an ETL. Reactions with the disulfides should help to prevent decomposition at the surface of the MAPbI3 layer, or at the Ag electrode due to the ability of the sulfur atoms to complex inorganic ions. The relatively uniform coverage of MAPbI3 by 2PDI-4S, as shown in the AFM topographies (Fig. S1, ESI), help to suppress ion migration to the silver electrode, but the increased lifetime performance of 2PDI-4S suggest the disulfide moieties play an additional role in protecting the Ag electrodes. This is in line with the well-documented ability of thiols and disulfides to form self-assembled monolayers on gold and silver surfaces.

In conclusion, we have fabricated inverted planar-structure MAPbI3 based solar cells with 2PDI-nS (n = 0, 2, 3 and 4) as the ETL. The devices show no hysteresis in the J–V characteristics or a delay of the photocurrent upon illumination, suggesting ideal electronic and physical contact between MAPbI3 and the ETLs. AFM topography images show 2PDI-2S, 2PDI-3S and 2PDI-4S form smooth and grain-less films on MAPbI3. The devices with 2PDI-0S and 2PDI-4S gave PCEs of 14.0% and 11.0%, respectively, after thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, which outperform PCBM-based devices (10.9%). Light-soaking tests reveal that 2PDI-0S and 2PDI-4S devices have significantly higher stabilities than PCBM ones, especially 2PDI-4S devices. The solar cells jump in performance during a burn-in period then show little change in the PCE over 400 h. Our results suggest that 2PDI-nS compounds are suitable for realizing high performance and stable HOIP-PVs and that disulfide bridges may play a large role in protecting from corrosion of the Ag electrode by iodides.


Photovoltaic devices were prepared as following. Glass substrates covered by ITO (University Wafers) were sonicated in acetone and then isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each. The substrates were further cleaned with air-plasma under 300 mTorr. All of the processes hereafter were conducted under nitrogen. A 2 mg mL−1 solution of polytriarylamine (PTAA, Aldrich) in chlorobenzene (Aldrich) were spun-coat on the substrates at 6000 rpm. A MAPbI3 precursor solution was formulated by dissolving a 1/1/1 (mol/mol/mol) mixture of methylammonium iodide (Dysol), lead iodide (Aldrich) and dimethyl sulfide (Aldrich) in anhydrous DMF (Aldrich). The DMF solution was spun-coat on the PTAA layer at 1000 rpm for 10 s then 4000 rpm for 30 s. When 8 s passed after the spin speed turned 4000 rpm, 0.2 mL of anhydrous chlorobenzene (Aldrich) was dropped on the substrate. The films were transferred on a hotplate of 100 °C immediately, and thermally annealed for 10 min. A solution for the ETL layer (30 mg mL−1 for PCBM in chlorobenzene, 20 mg mL−1 in toluene for the other compounds) were spun-coat on the MAPbI3 layer at 1000 rpm, followed by a spin-coat of PEIE in isopropyl alcohol (0.02 wt%, diluted from 37% aqueous solution of PEIE from Aldrich) at 6000 rpm. The devices were finally capped with Ag (80 nm) by vacuum deposition. For the samples for photoluminescence studies, a MAPbI3 layer was spun coat on a quartz substrate and the ETL layer was then spun coat on the MAPbI3.


The J–V characteristics were measured at 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) in a N2-filled glovebox with a solar simulator equipped with a xenon lamp (Newport), a Keithley 2602 Source Meter and a calibrated silicon reference cell. The voltage was scanned from 1.5 V to −0.5 V (reverse) then immediately back to 1.5 V (forward scan) at 0.01 V step to observe the hysteresis. Each step takes 30 ms for waiting and 16.7 ms for current measurement, resulting in a scan speed of 0.21 V s−1. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was calculated with the following equation: PCE (%) = 100 × VOC × JSC × FF/Pinc from the open circuit voltage, VOC, the short circuit current, JSC, the fill factor FF and the incident powder Pinc. The stability of encapsulated devices (filled with nitrogen) under illumination was examined at a maximum-power-point by using a fixed resistor (220 Ω) under continuous full-sun illumination at 35 °C without UV cutting filter (SIGMAKOKI CO., LTD, SCF-50S-42L). The active area of the cells is 0.16 cm2. The incident photon to light efficiencies (IPCEs) were analyzed using a fully computerized measurement system consisting of a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport), a monochromator (Newport CS130), a chopper controller (Newport), two current preamplifiers (SRS SR570), and two lock-in amplifiers (SRS SR810).


Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) technique. Approximately 100 femtosecond (fs) excitation pulses with wavelength 400 nm were generated by doubling the fundamental frequency of fs Ti:sapphire laser (Spectraphysics Tsunami) pulses in a commercial optical harmonic generator (Inrad). The laser repetition rate was reduced to 2 MHz by a home-made acousto-optical pulse picker in order to avoid saturation of the chromophore. TCSPC system is equipped with thermoelectrically-cooled single-photon counting avalanche photodiode (Micro Photon Devices) and electronics board (Becker & Hickl SPC-630) and has instrument response time about 30–40 picoseconds. Triggering signal for the TCSPC board was generated by sending a small fraction of the laser beam onto a fast (400 MHz bandwidth) Si photodiode (Thorlabs Inc.). Fluorescence signal was dispersed in Acton Research SPC-500 monochromator after passing through a pump blocking, long wavelength-pass, autofluorescence-free, interference filter (Omega Filters, ALP series). In addition to the time-resolved detector, the monochromator is equipped with a CCD camera (Roper Scientific PIXIS-400) allowing for monitoring of the time-averaged fluorescence spectrum. Luminescence transients were not deconvolved with the instrument response function since their characteristic time-constants were much longer than the width of the system response to the excitation pulse.
