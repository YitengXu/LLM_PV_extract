Alkyne linked tetracene dimers were synthesized from naphthacenequinone and terminal acetylenes. The silylethynyl tetracene dimers exhibit good solubility, high photostability, and broad absorbance leading to photocurrent generation in an organic photovoltaic device.


Acenes are linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons comprising n fused benzene rings. Acenes where n = 3, 4, and 5, are extensively used as active materials for organic electronic applications. Unfortunately, acenes are hindered by poor solubility and poor stability towards photodegradation mechanisms, including photooxidation and photodimerization. To overcome these limitations, ethynyl-substituted acenes have been proposed leading to stable and processable tetracene,pentacene,hexacene and heptacene derivatives. In addition, ethynyl-substituted acenes exhibit a significant structural improvement in the solid-state, promoting face-to-face instead of face-to-edge (herringbone) packing. Such modifications offer tunability of the π-orbital overlap and therefore control of intrinsic charge carrier mobility, an important parameter for electronic applications. In order to promote face-to-face packing in the solid-state, we may consider alkyne linked acene. Hu et al. reported an alkyne linked anthracene derivative. However, dimers with n > 3 cannot be made following this route due to the instability of the unprotected ethynyl-substituted acenes. Grieco et al. reported a one pot synthesis of bisarylethynylenes by modification of the Sonogashira coupling reaction employing an amidine base and a substoichiometric amount of water in order to generate an in situ deprotection of trimethylsilylethynylene-added intermediates. Unfortunately, this method results in the formation of ring-fused products when applied to halides on the peri position of linearly fused systems such as anthracene or tetracene. Therefore, to our knowledge, linked acenes of n > 3 have never been reported in a fully π-conjugated system.

In this communication, we present stable, soluble acetylide-bridged tetracene dimers. We report the successful synthesis and the photophysical properties of silylethynyl-substituted tetracene dimers. Furthermore, we extended our investigation to other substituents as well as pentacene highlighting the promising stability and processability of silylethynyl-based tetracene dimer derivatives. We also report photocurrent generation from an optically excited alkyne linked tetracene dimer in an organic photovoltaic device structure.
We designed a one pot synthesis (Scheme 1) based on a modification of the procedure described by Anthony et al.5,12-Naphthacenequinone was added to a solution of the appropriate alkynyl lithium reagent followed by pH controlled solution of HCl saturated with stannous chloride. The relative yield of monomer to dimer appears to be strongly pH dependent. Indeed, it seems that deprotection of the silyl group, competing with a hydrolysis/reduction step in a kinetic process, promotes the dimer formation in low to acceptable yields. To investigate this hypothesis, several ethynyltetracene dimers were prepared with different protecting groups, such as triethylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and methyldiphenylsilyl. Larger substituents decrease the rate of hydrolysis of the silyl group. The tetracene dimer yields 13% for the synthesis of triethylsilylethynyltetracene dimer (6) whereas only 7% and 4% were obtained with triisopropylsilyl and methyldiphenylsilyl, respectively. Based on the monomer/dimer ratio, the alkyne linked tetracene reaches an optimized yield for pH = 0. Even though the yield seems to be limited by the synthesis procedure, the scheme proves acceptable yield with a very easy workup whereas the classic scheme is expected to be unfruitful involving no less than 5 steps. This synthetic procedure was applied to generate a triethylsilylethynylpentacene dimer as a green insoluble solid, characterized by MALDI-TOF analysis. Diphenyltetracene dimer (3) was synthesized from 12-phenyl-12H-naphthacen-5-one but was unstable and mainly decomposed during the workup, giving a very low yield.
Molecular structures of tetracene dimers as well as their corresponding monomers are shown in Fig. 1a. Absorption (Fig. 1b) and emission (Fig. 1c) spectra of 3 and 6 are compared to their corresponding monomers diphenyltetracene (1), diphenylpentacene (2) and triethylsilylethynyltetracene (4), triethylsilylethynylpentacene (5). 3 and 6 are both soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane. 3 is purple as a neat solid and purplish pink in solution, whereas 6 is dark blue both as a neat solid and in solution. 3 exhibits local absorption peak maxima at λmax = 286 nm and λmax = 573 nm, whereas these peaks are slightly red-shifted for 6 giving λmax = 289 nm and λmax = 612 nm. The high energy band in 3 shifts 6 nm and 16 nm compared to the corresponding tetracene and pentacene derivatives, respectively, whereas 6 shifts 6 nm and 17 nm, respectively. The low energy band of 3 shifts 84 nm and 19 nm compared to tetracene and pentacene, respectively, whereas 6 shifts 83 nm and 22 nm, respectively. Note that both alkyne linked tetracenes (3 and 6) shift similarly compared to their respective tetracene and pentacene monomers.

Emission spectra (Fig. 1c) and relevant photophysical properties (Table 1) were recorded at room temperature under N2-deaerated 2MeTHF. Both tetracene and pentacene monomers exhibit a structured fluorescence in solution at room temperature. 1 (λmax = 497 nm, Φfl = 0.51, τfl = 6 ns) and 4 (λmax = 535 nm, Φfl = 0.66, τfl = 13 ns) show an intense fluorescence emission, whereas those coming from 2 (λmax = 608 nm, Φfl = 0.10, τfl = 12 ns) and 5 (λmax = 647 nm, Φfl = 0.29, τfl = 16 ns) are weaker. No phosphorescence emission has been observed. On the other hand, alkyne linked tetracene dimers (3 and 6) do not show either fluorescence or phosphorescence emission. However, fluorescent emission (λmax = 515 nm, Φfl = 0.31, τfl = 15 ns) from a solution of 3 was observed after air/white light exposure. This observed emission matches that of triethyl-(12-phenyl-naphthacen-5-ylethynyl)-silane, highlighting a partial photooxidation that breaks the π-conjugated system between the two tetracene backbones. A similar report on phenyl group stability was documented by Miller et al. when in the preparation of 2. Ethynyl silane groups show good stability to photodegradation. After exposure to air and white light for several weeks, solutions of 6 do not show significant bleaching or residual fluorescent emission.

4–6 show reversible oxidation and reduction (Table 2). 6 exhibits an identical reduction potential (−1.50 V) to 5. However, its oxidation potential (0.40 V) lies between that of the corresponding derivatives of tetracene (0.54 V) and pentacene (0.34 V).

The solid-state ionization energy (Ei) and electron affinity (Ea) of Ei = −5.16 eV and Ea = −3.00 eV estimated from the electrochemical data for 6 suggest that this material may be an interesting donor for organic solar cells or photodetectors.
Current-density versus voltage characteristics are depicted in Fig. 2 for organic photovoltaic devices consisting of ITO/MoO3(100 Å)/Donor(100 Å)/C60(400 Å)/BCP(100 Å)/Al(1000 Å), where the Donor is a spin-cast neat film of either 4 or 6. 4 based device exhibits a short-circuit current-density of Jsc = 1.48 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of Voc = 1.06 V and fill factor of FF = 0.34, giving power conversion efficiency of ηp = 0.5%. The photovoltage for the 6 based device (Voc = 0.31 V) is substantially lower than that for the monomer devices. The dimer exhibits marginally higher photocurrent and fill factor, with Jsc = 1.73 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.37, leading to ηp = 0.2%.
The HOMO of 4 is stabilized by ∼0.2 eV compared to 6. This leads to a slightly larger energy offset ΔEDA[EHOMO(Donor) − ELUMO(Acceptor)], for 4 in contrast to 6. Since the thermodynamic limit to open-circuit voltage is expected to be linearly correlated with ΔEDA, it is not surprising that the Voc is lower for the dimer. However, the sizable disparity in photovoltage is incommensurate with the relatively small difference in ΔEDA (ΔEDA(6) = −1.66 eV, whereas ΔEDA(4) = −1.86 eV, assuming ELUMO(C60) = −3.5 eV). Such an effect has recently been attributed to the susceptibility of the donor π-system to attack the acceptor material during a charge recombination event, making recombination losses kinetically facile in materials with sterically exposed π-systems. Each of the coplanar tetracene cores in 6 is flanked by only one triethylsilyl group, while the tetracene core in 4 is flanked by two of these bulky substituents. As a result, the π-system of 6 is more exposed and therefore more susceptible to recombination losses, leading to lower open-circuit voltage. This suggests that the marked disparity in Voc between 4 and 6 is largely a kinetic effect. Semi-log scale dark current traces are available in ESI.
In Fig. 2b, the absorption coefficient (α, upper panel) for C60 (grey dot dashed line), 4 (black dotted line), and 6 (red solid line) is compared to the quantum efficiency (lower panel) for the devices described in Fig. 2a. The quantum efficiency for the 6 based device is slightly higher than that for the 4 device. The spectrum exhibits features reminiscent of the 6 vibronic structure, whereas only C60 structure is observed in the 4 response. To more clearly illustrate the 6 photoresponse, the estimated contribution of 6 to the overall quantum efficiency is plotted as open circles on the ΔQE axis in the lower panel of Fig. 2b. Comparing the 6 photocurrent contribution with its absorption profile suggests that forward electron transfer from optically excited 6 to C60 leads to photocurrent generation in the dimer-based devices.
In conclusion, a simple route towards the synthesis of acetylide-bridged tetracene dimers is proposed. Triethylsilylethynyl tetracene dimer (6) shows high solubility in common organic solvents as well as high stability to photodegradation mechanisms. A triethylsilylethynyl tetracene dimer exhibits a very broad low energy absorption band with maximum absorption λ = 612 nm, intermediate in energy compared to tetracene and pentacene derivatives. Alkyne linked tetracene dimers do not show emission properties, in contrast to their respective fluorescent monomer derivatives. Furthermore, the triethylsilylethynyl tetracene dimer has been incorporated into prototypical organic photovoltaic devices, demonstrating that optically excited dimers can lead to photocurrent generation.
