Herein, we report the impact of chromium doping on the physical properties, electronic band structure and photovoltaic characteristics of their corresponding devices based on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Different DSCs with various compositions of the photoanode electrodes are fabricated to study their optical, structural, conduction band edge, donor density, depth of trap states and photoelectrochemical properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Mott–Schottky capacitance analysis, chemical capacitance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. For such studies, the Cr-doped TiO2 films, with different Cr:Ti atomic ratios of 0.1–5% and a particle size in the range 15–30 nm, are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process. We find that on introduction of Cr3+ into the TiO2 lattice, the films exhibit small band gap, an upward shift in the conduction and valence band edges, and a low donor density. The results show that the Cr-doped TiO2 electrodes have a lower recombination rate, a superior electron lifetime and a higher open circuit voltage than pristine TiO2. However, these electrodes show a poor dye adsorption due to the surface defects of Ti3+ and the charge transport characteristics, resulting in a low short-circuit current. Furthermore, doping of TiO2 with chromium may induce a high density of empty trap states with a deep position, leading to an entrapment of the charge carriers, a drop in electron conductivity and, therefore, an inferior photovoltaic performance of the solar cells.

Worldwide attention to environmental issues has brought TiO2 nanoparticles into a focus of many researchers for decades. Their non-toxicity, long-term stability, facile and economical production along with the suitable electronic structure have led to a wide range of environmentally friendly applications such as in self-cleaning and antibacterial surfaces, photocatalysts for the pollutant decomposition and photoanodes in DSCs. As a matter of fact, to date, no other semiconductors could replace the vital role of nanocrystalline TiO2 in the applications of DSCs neither scholarly nor commercially.

Studying the electronic structure of the photoanode semiconductor in a DSC and understanding its effects on the cell performance are of great importance. To date, various methods have been adopted in order to alter the electronic structure of TiO2 nanomaterials by changing their chemical composition. One of the most efficient approaches among them is doping process, in which a trace amount of impurities is inserted into the semiconductor lattice. This process induces various changes in the electronic properties, such as conduction band edge position, trap level distribution and majority carrier density, as well as affects the photoanode physical properties, including dye adsorption and crystal structure. Consequently, these changes can either modify or deprave the cell performance or even make no considerable alterations as a result of mutual interactions. The study of all these features seems necessary when the doping process is considered.
In order to select a proper dopant element for the TiO2 lattice, ionic radius of the former should not differ much from the radius of Ti4+ ion to prevent lattice distortion. The negligible size difference between Cr3+ (75.5 pm) and Ti4+ (74.5 pm) makes it a proper ion for such substitution. Moreover, the incorporation of a transition metal into TiO2 lattice can give rise to the formation of a wide range of new energy levels near the conduction band and effectively change its electronic properties due to their partially filled d-orbitals. These features have made the chromium element an attractive impurity for TiO2 photocatalyst applications. To date, a few studies have been performed on chromium-doped TiO2 as the photoanode of DSCs, in which using prolonged sol–gel or multi-step hydrothermal methods with different additives have led to doped nanoparticles. The physical and photovoltaic properties of these nanoparticles were discussed; however, no proper investigation on the electronic structure of the photoanodes was reported. Xie et al. synthesized Cr-doped TiO2 with Cr:TiO2 molar ratio of 10–70 ppm by a combination of sol–gel and hydrothermal processes. They reported an improvement in electron transport, lifetime and short-circuit photocurrent density; however, no study on the carrier density and band structure of the electrode was presented. Kim et al. attained Cr-doped TiO2 using almost the same procedure with a high Cr:TiO2 molar ratio (0.5–10 at%). They noticed a decrement of photocurrent density of the device, but no further investigation was carried out on the electronic structure of the monolayer photoanode. In our previous work, we also observed an enhancement in short-circuit current density of the double-layer DSC device made of sol–gel derived Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and this was explained by porosity and scattering modifications of the photoanodes.
In the present work, we focus on the impact of the compositional manipulation of Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles on the band edge position, band gap energy, donor density and capability to adsorb N719 dye molecules of the prepared photoanodes from these nanoparticles. In addition, the morphology, size distribution and crystal structure of the nanoparticles are studied. Cr-Doped TiO2 nanoparticles are synthesized by a relatively rapid hydrothermal process without any additives using chromium chloride as a precursor. Eventually, the photovoltaic performance of the DSC devices composed of Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles as well as their electrochemical properties, including charge transfer, transport, density and depth of trap states, are interpreted in relation to the abovementioned properties.

We synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles (TN) with a particle size in the range of 15–30 nm and the anatase crystal structure by the combination of optimized sol–gel and hydrothermal processes as previously reported elsewhere. Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP), with a purity of 97% (Aldrich, UK), as a titanium precursor was dissolved in 1-octanol as the solvent, with a purity of 99% (Merck, Germany), to form a 0.55 M solution. To start the hydrolysis reaction, deionized water was added to the abovementioned solution in order to form a TiO2 sol with a molar ratio of [H2O]:[Ti] = 3.3:1. For completing the hydrolysis and condensation reactions, the sol was stirred at a rotation speed of 480 rpm for 30 min. To grow the nanoparticles under hydrothermal process at 180 °C for 4 h, the prepared sol was first transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at a filling ratio of 70% and then cooled naturally to room temperature. The obtained product (i.e. anatase TiO2 nanoparticles) was washed with dilute ethanol and deionized water several times, followed by drying at room temperature.

For the case of the Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles, all previous steps were followed except that various amounts of CrCl3·6H2O with a purity of 98% (Fluka, UK) were dissolved in deionized water and then added to the titanium precursor mixture. At the end of the process, the obtained yellow precipitates were washed with pure acetone and a mixture of acetone and deionized water several times for complete removal of chloride ions. The chromium-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are denoted as CTx in which x refers to different Cr:Ti atomic ratios used in this study (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 3 and 5 at%).

We developed a new formulation of a TiO2 paste in our laboratory using the synthesized powders and deionized water in order to prepare the photoanode electrodes. Two categories of mono-layer photoanodes were prepared consisting of pristine TiO2 nanoparticles with different thicknesses, as the reference electrode, as well as Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with various dopant percentages, as listed in Table 1.

The first category of DSCs covered four mono-layer TiO2 films with different thicknesses in the range 13–38 μm (designated as TN13, TN18, TN22 and TN38). The effect of the film thickness on the photovoltaic characteristics of DSCs made of pristine TiO2 nanoparticles was studied in order to determine the optimal thickness, being around 22 μm. We studied the impact of the Cr:Ti atomic ratio on the photovoltaic and electrochemical characteristics of the second category of DSCs composed of the Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with the optimal thickness of the photoanodes (i.e. 22 μm). For the preparation of the photoanodes, the pastes were coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (2.0 × 1.5 cm2 and with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω sq−1) using a spin-coater. The spin coating parameters were controlled in order to obtain the desired thickness. The deposited films were sintered at 400 °C for 2 h in air, followed by post-treatment with 0.04 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min in a closed vessel and final heat treatment at 450 °C for 30 min. We soaked the resulting electrodes in an ethanol-based solution containing 0.5 mM ruthenium(II) dye (Ruthenium 535-bisTBA dye, or N719, Solaronix) for 18 h. The redox electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The platinum-coated FTO substrate as a counter electrode was placed over the dye-adsorbed electrode, and the edges of the cell were sealed with surlyn film (Solaronix) by hot pressing at 120 °C. Finally, the redox iodine-based electrolyte composed of 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was injected into the cell.

The structural properties of the prepared powders and photoanodes were studied via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Mira 3-XMU) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X’pert, PW1730) employing Cu-Kα radiation. The elemental composition of the powders was also studied by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS, EDAX DX-4). Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements of the samples were recorded using an Avantes spectrophotometer (Model Avaspec-2048-TEC). The flat band potential and donor density of the pristine and doped TiO2 films were obtained from the Mott–Schottky capacitance analysis, using a potentiostat/galvanostat instrument (Autolab, PGSTAT 302N, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). The test was performed in a three-electrode cell, in which an Ag/AgCl standard electrode, a platinum wire and a 3 M Na2SO4 solution were used as a reference, a counter electrode and an electrolyte solution, respectively. Photovoltaic measurements of the fabricated solar cells were carried out using a Zahner Cimps pcs solar simulator (Zahner, Kronach, Germany) equipped with the Thales software under standard test conditions (i.e. an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 spectrum) with a reference Si cell. The active area of the samples was kept near 0.25 cm2 and controlled by an imaging processing software (ImageJ, 1.44 p). The thickness of the photoanodes was measured with a Tensor Alpha-step Profiler. In order to evaluate the capability of the photoelectrodes to adsorb N719 dye molecules, dye desorption method was used, followed by an analysis of desorption using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Jenway 6705, Staffordshire, UK). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSC devices were recorded with the Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat set up under both illumination (100 mW cm−2) and dark conditions. The test conditions were set under an open-circuit potential in a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. EIS experimental data were fitted by proper equivalent circuits using a ZView software.



Fig. 1 illustrates the FE-SEM images of the pristine and Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. We observed that, in all cases, the nanoparticles have a narrow particle size distribution in the range 15–30 nm. Therefore, no significant changes in the morphology and particle size were detected by doping TiO2 with chromium ions. Furthermore, the elemental composition study of CT0.3, CT1 and CT5 nanoparticles via EDS analysis (the insets of Fig. 1) verified the presence of small amounts of chromium within the samples.

Moreover, Fig. 2 shows FE-SEM images of the prepared pristine and 0.3 at% Cr-doped TiO2 photoanode electrodes. All electrodes have a porous structure, as a result of the removal of the additives included in the paste formulation, and an approximate average thickness of 22 μm (the insets of Fig. 2).

The XRD patterns of the pristine and doped TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e. CT0.3 and CT5) are shown in Fig. 3. All peaks of the pristine nanoparticles (Fig. 3a) are assignable to the tetragonal anatase phase (JCPDS card no. 00-001-0562) with the strongest peak at 2θ = 25.3° corresponding to the (110) plane. We found no change in the crystal structure of the Cr-doped particles (Fig. 3b and c). Moreover, no undesired phase of chromium compounds (such as chromium oxides and Cr–Ti oxide) was observed, which may indicate the effective incorporation of the dopant element into the TiO2 lattice. The vertical dotted lines in Fig. 3 demonstrate no shift in the peak positions, which is a common phenomenon when, according to Bragg's law, the inter-planar spacing of the host lattice is changed via the doping process. However, since the Cr3+ radius is only 1.3% bigger than that of Ti4+, the substitution may not induce a considerable change in lattice parameters. Furthermore, it is known that for the replacement of Ti4+ by Cr3+ ions, some Ti–O bonds are broken, which leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies.

As a result, the contraction of lattice caused by oxygen deficiency may eliminate the lattice expansion induced by the entrance of slightly larger chromium ions. The average crystallite size of TN and CT5 particles was calculated to be around 14 and 10 nm, respectively, using Scherrer equation. The decrease in the crystallite size of the Cr-doped nanoparticles can be related to the presence of the Cr–O–Ti bond, which can prevent joining of the neighboring crystals, resulting in suppressing the crystal growth. However, such reduction in the crystallite size of the doped samples may increase the grain boundary defects, which have negative effects on their electrical conduction.
The TN and CT0.3 electrodes were prepared by the conversion of their powders into pastes, followed by two times annealing at 400 °C and at 450 °C for sintering and TiCl4 post-treatment, respectively. The impact of these processes on the crystal structure of the photoanodes was studied, as shown in Fig. 4. No significant change was detected in the crystal structure and the phase composition of the electrodes in comparison with those of their corresponding starting materials.


Fig. 5 illustrates the optical absorption of the pristine and Cr-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. As seen for pristine TiO2, the absorption edge was located at 400 nm, which is ascribed to the intrinsic band gap absorption of the anatase crystal structure. However, the introduction of Cr3+ into the TiO2 lattice and the increase of its content lead to the movement of the absorption edge toward a longer wavelength known as a “red-shift” phenomenon. This sensitive increment to visible light can be associated with the appearance of additional energy levels caused by the doping process. It has been reported that the higher absorption intensity around 450, 500–600 and 600–800 nm can be related to the excitation of 3d electrons of the dopant ion to the TiO2 conduction band, the oxygen vacancy states generated due to the difference of the Cr3+ and Ti4+ valence states and the d–d transition of Cr ion itself. It is evident that the intensity of visible absorption increases with increasing dopant concentration up to 3 at%.

Such a phenomenon is not observed for further increase in the dopant content up to 5 at% and this can be related to the ineffective substitution of a part of Cr ions at the Ti ion positions and the possible formation of a low amount of Cr(OH)3, which cannot be recognized by XRD analysis.
According to Kubelka–Munk equation, the diffuse reflectance value of a sample (R) can be related to the absorption coefficient (α) and scattering coefficient (S) as follows:
(1)
On the other hand, the Tauc model represents a relationship between
α and an estimation of the optical band gap of the material (Eg) according to the following equation:

αhν = A(hν − Eg)r
(2)
where
hν is the photon energy, A is a constant that depends on the properties of the material and r is a constant that can take different values depending on the type of electronic transition, in our case, r = 1/2 for an allowed direct optical transition. As a consequence of two previous equations, the band gap energy of the samples can be evaluated by plotting (F(R)hν1/2) versus hν with the extrapolation of the linear region to the low energies (Fig. 6) according to the obtained equation:

(3)
The intersection of the linear fit with the energy axis determines
Eg values for TN, CT0.3, CT3 and CT5 to be 3.14, 2.99, 1.81 and 1.94 eV, respectively. It is evident that the band gap energy of nanoparticles decreases remarkably with the introduction of Cr ions into the TiO2 lattice. CT3 has the lowest Eg among all samples as it seems that 3 at% of chromium is the optimal content for doping into the TiO2 lattice. As mentioned earlier, a greater Cr atomic percentage results in the ineffective doping and the formation of undesired chromium compounds. The band gap of 1.81 eV is one of the lowest reported Eg in the literature for single doped TiO2 with a low content of the dopant.


The electronic properties of semiconductors can be studied using Mott–Schottky capacitance analysis, in which the induced capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte interface, known as space charge capacitance (Csc), is measured as a function of potential (V) under a depletion condition. In fact, Mott–Schottky equation points out the linear part of the relation between Csc and V as follows:

(4)
where
Vfb represents the flat band potential (the applied potential at which the semiconductor energy bands can remain flat without band bending), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the TiO2 layer (about 61), A is the active surface area of the electrodes, q is the electron charge, ND is the density of donor impurities, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature (298 K). According to the above equation, the intercept of the linear region with the x-axis  and the slope of the tangent line in the Mott–Schottky plot give values of Vfb and ND, respectively. Fig. 7 displays the Mott–Schottky plots of the pristine and Cr-doped TiO2 electrodes, and the calculated values of the abovementioned parameters are listed in Table 2. We observe that the donor density of Cr-doped TiO2 is lower than that of pristine TiO2. This can be related to the substitution of Cr3+ with one valence state less than that of the Ti4+ host atom, resulting in the formation of positively charged oxygen vacancy, which can act as an acceptor and decrease the donor density.

Moreover, it can be seen that the flat band potentials of the samples have a negative shift with an increase the dopant concentration due to a shift in the position of the conduction band edge toward more negative potentials (an upward shift in the band structure diagram).

Fig. 8 represents the band structure of the TiO2 electrode in contact with an electrolyte. Ec, Ev and ΔE are conduction band edge, valence band edge and the difference of Fermi level and conduction band edge position, respectively. The value of the flat band potential (Efb) measured at the electrode/electrolyte interface versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) has been assigned to Fermi level of the semiconductor (Ef). The approximate scheme of the sample can be obtained using data of DRS and Mott–Schottky methods. The calculated Efbversus Ag/AgCl reference electrode must be converted to a potential in SHE scale using the following equation:
Efb (V vs. SHE) = Efb (V vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.224 (V)
(5)
Conversion of flat band potential
versus SHE to potential relative to vacuum (known as Eabsolute) may give Fermi level as follows:

Eabsoulte (V vs. vacuum) = −Efb (V vs. SHE) − 4.44 (V) = Ef (eV)
(6)
In order to estimate the position of the conduction band edge, Δ
E value is required, which is around 0.3 eV for oxide semiconductors with a conductivity in the range of 100–1000 Ω cm:

Ec = Ef + 0.3 (eV)
(7)
Eventually, using the calculated
Eg in Section 3.3 can give us the approximate position of the valence band using the following equation:

Ev = Ec − Eg
(8)
The calculated values for the TN and CT0.3 samples and the resultant schematic of their band structure are represented in
Table 3 and Fig. 9, respectively. We conclude that introduction of chromium into the TiO2 lattice may shift the conduction and valence band edge positions upward in the energy band structure diagram.

In order to improve the photovoltaic performance of the DSC devices, the electron injection mechanism by controlling the thickness of the photoelectrodes for an enhancement of dye loading is commonly used. We present the impact of this mechanism on the photocurrent density–potential (J–V) characteristics of the pristine TiO2 electrodes with different thicknesses in the range of 13–38 μm, as shown in Fig. 10. In addition, the corresponding photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (η) and the calculated amount of the adsorbed dye are summarized in Table 4. We found that the open-circuit potential of DSCs decreases with an increase in the photoanode thickness since the number of trapping surface states can increase when the electrodes become thicker, through which the back electron transfer would be enhanced. As a result, Voc drops according to its inversely proportional relationship with the rate of charge recombination.

The improvement of Jsc from 12.97 to 15.92 mA cm−2 with an increment of the photoanode thickness from 13 to 22 μm is related to facilitating injection of electrons from the excited dye molecules, arising from the increased active surface area and the adsorbed dye molecules. However, a further increase in the thickness to 38 μm would make the back electron transfer as a dominant factor, resulting in the Jsc drop to 12.72 mA cm−2. We observed a similar behavior for a variation of the power conversion efficiency with a thickness of photoelectrode reaching a maximum at a specific value. Consequently, the TN22 solar cell shows the highest performance of 6.92% among all fabricated DSCs, and the optimal thickness is determined to be around 22 μm.
We studied the impact of doping with chromium ions on the photovoltaic and electrochemical properties of DSCs made of the Cr-doped TiO2 electrodes with the optimal thickness and various Cr:Ti atomic ratios. The FE-SEM images from the top view and intersection of the pristine and 0.3 at% Cr doped TiO2 photoanodes are presented in Fig. 2.
The J–V behavior of the Cr-doped TiO2 solar cells and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters in addition to the calculated amount of the adsorbed dye are represented in Fig. 11 and Table 5, respectively. The dye loading was determined via a spectroscopic method by measuring the concentration of the adsorbed dye on the electrode surface in the solution of 0.1 M NaOH. According to Beer–Lambert law, the amount of the adsorbed dye was calculated with regard to the macroscopic geometric area of the electrodes and the extinction coefficient of 45900 for the desorption solution at the peak at 308 nm wavelength.

We observe that Voc of the cells increases with an increase in the dopant concentration. Since the difference between the Fermi level of the TiO2 layer and the electrolyte redox potential defines the maximum potential generated, such increment can be explained by a negative shift of Vfb by means of doping, resulting in the elevation of Ef and Ec in their position as shown in Fig. 9.
Besides, a lower recombination rate generally leads to a larger Voc, which is in line with the outcomes of EIS analysis (see Section 3.6.). The next important parameter for the investigation is the amount of the adsorbed dye, which greatly influences the short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency of the cells. A decrease in dye loading was observed with an increase in the dopant concentration and can be explained by the tendency of the dye molecules to attach by the chemisorption onto the thermodynamically stable Ti4+ sites. Therefore, it can be concluded that the probable presence of the Ti3+ surface defects as a result of the doping process may cause a dye loading reduction (Fig. 12). Additionally, the dopant may affect the dye adsorption by a change in the binding affinity of the dye to the doped surface. However, no reliable data are available yet for the binding affinity between Cr3+ ions and carboxylate groups of the dye molecule by means of which its grafting on the TiO2 surface can occur.
It is evident that Jsc decreases with an increment in the dopant concentration, which can be explained by three facts. The first fact is the significant drop in the amount of the adsorbed dye. Second, the aforementioned upward shift in the position of conduction band edge may reduce the injection driving force of the electrons (namely the difference between Ec of the semiconductor and the LUMO of the dye), which contributes to the depression in the electron injection efficiency. Besides, the probable upward movement of the valence band edge can make the transfer of the excited dye molecule holes from HOMO to Ev of TiO2 easily, which leaves a lower amount of dyes in their ground state level for further electron injection. The third fact is the lower values of ND for the doped samples, leading to a lower electrical conductivity (a more detailed study on this matter is provided in Section 3.6). Keeping in mind all the explanations, the decrease in the power conversion efficiency of DSCs with increasing dopant concentration is understandable.

More information on the influence of Cr-doping on the photovoltaic properties of TiO2 is available by EIS analysis under illumination and dark conditions. Fig. 13 represents the Nyquist and Bode phase plots for pristine and 0.3 at% Cr-doped TiO2 cells, which shows highest efficiency under 100 mW cm−2 at an open-circuit potential. Basically, a standard Nyquist plot contains three segments. The distance between the origin of the plot and the x-intercept is assigned to a series resistance (Rs), particularly including the sheet resistance of FTO glass and other ohmic resistances of the cell components. The smaller semicircle in the high-frequency range is associated with the charge transfer resistances at the interface of platinum/electrolyte (Rpt) and TiO2/FTO (RFTO) in the parallel connection with their related interfacial capacitances (i.e., CPEPt and CPEFTO, respectively). The intermediate-frequency response is due to the parallel connection of the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct) and its associated capacitance (CPEct). The last two mentioned transfers are also visible in the Bode phase plot in the shape of two peaks in the high and intermediate range of frequencies. Table 6 lists the extracted values of the as-mentioned resistances by fitting a proper equivalent circuit (the inset of Fig. 13) to the Nyquist plots.

According to Table 6, the minor difference in Rs can be related to the possible variation in the sheet resistance of the employed FTO substrates. A relatively higher value of RFTO for the CT0.3 cell might be due to the inferior adhesion of the doped TiO2 film to the FTO substrate. We observe that the charge transfer resistance between the platinum counter electrode and the electrolyte is increased for the CT0.3 cell. Since the value of RPt is inversely proportional to the square root of the I3− concentration within the electrolyte, this increase can be related to the higher concentration of triiodide ion in the electrolyte for the CT0.3 cell. Under illumination condition, the determining factor for the concentration of I3− species is the amount of the excited dye molecules, which tend to be regenerated by the provided electrons from I− species in the electrolyte, hence, converting them to triiodide ions. Overall, a lower amount of dye loading in the CT0.3 cell can lead to the reduction in the RPt parameter. As mentioned before, the Rct parameter refers to the resistance of all the charge transfer reactions occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Three most important transfers at this interface would be the electron injection from LUMO to the TiO2 conduction band (with a time constant on the order of 0.05–150 ps), the electron back transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to triiodide species in the electrolyte (with a time constant on the order of 1 ms) and the electron recombination with oxidized dye (in the 0.1 ms time range). The electron injection process is the most dominant reaction and the effective factor on Rct in particular when DSC is under illumination due to its rapid transfer. However, between the other two processes, the electron recombination with triiodide species has more contribution in Rct even though it has the slowest rate, because most electrons required for dye molecule regeneration are provided by the electrolyte. Consequently, the increment in Rct for the CT0.3 cell can be mostly attributed to the fewer number of injected electrons owing to its lower short-circuit photocurrent.
We also measured EIS of the pristine and Cr-doped TiO2 DSCs under a dark condition at an applied bias potential of −0.7 V in order to study their charge transfer and transport reactions rather than their capability for dye adsorption. The experimental and fitting data as well as the equivalent circuit are presented in Fig. 14. Moreover, the extracted values of series, charge transfer resistances and electron transport resistance of the photoanodes, known as Rtr, are listed in Table 7.

The reason for different values of Rs and RFTO is similar to that explained earlier. However, various amounts of RPt, due to the elimination of dye excitation process in the absence of light, can be explained as follows. The applied bias potential under the dark condition tempts electrons to transport through the TiO2 electrode and react with triiodide species, resulting in the oxidation process of I− to I3− at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. Conclusively, a higher amount of RPt of the CT0.3 solar cell may be related to less electron exchange between the photoanode and the electrolyte, resulting in a low concentration of I− species and charge transfer at the platinum/electrolyte interface. We observe a remarkable change in Rct of the doped cell due to the process of back electron transfer with triiodide species as the most effective parameter on Rct. Consequently, the introduction of chromium into the TiO2 lattice results in a low recombination with the electrolyte and is consistent with the proposed model by Zhao et al. According to this model, two types of traps can be defined in the TiO2 band structure, known as bulk traps and surface states. Both of the traps consist of the localized electronic states within the band gap of the semiconductor. Bulk traps can only trade electrons with the conduction band. However, the surface states, which are the electron states physically located at the surface of nanoparticles, can exchange electrons with both TiO2 conduction band and acceptor species in the electrolyte. Furthermore, the electrons in the conduction band can also be back transferred to the electrolyte. Overall, Rct derives from the recombination process of the conduction band and/or the surface state electrons with the oxidized species, and the dominant process can be determined by its value. Since the recombination of the trapped electrons is relatively more difficult with a slow rate, the higher value of Rct can refer to the domination of the recombination of the surface states. Therefore, it can be concluded that the doping process may retard the recombination reaction by inducing more localized trap states into the TiO2 band gap. This can also illuminate a high Voc of the doped solar cells. Last, but not the least is the Rtr parameter, of which the increment for the CT0.3 solar cell simply indicates more difficult electron transport. Besides, the role of a low ND value of the doped samples in a poor conductivity can be assigned to the appearance of deeper trap states. The trap distribution is examined more closely in Section 3.6.
The other photoelectrochemical parameters related to the electron transfer and the transport ability of the photoanodes are calculated and listed in Table 8. The chemical capacitance of the photoanode (Cμ) and electron lifetime (τn) were calculated according to eqn (10) and (11):

The higher value of τn for the CT0.3 solar cell can be attributed to its higher density of traps, which hinder the recombination of charges toward the electrolyte. The electron diffusion length (Ld), diffusion coefficient (Dn), and conductivity (σn) parameters were calculated as follows:

(13)
where
L and A are the thickness and geometric area of the photoanodes, respectively. All three parameters, which are related to the charge transport capability of the photoanodes, are reduced for the Cr-doped TiO2 solar cell, indicating a lower electron conductivity and transport of TiO2 by doping with chromium. The charge collection efficiency (ηcc), that is the charge collection capability of the device, shows a correlation between the charge transport and the recombination resistances of the electrode:

(14)
We conclude that the charge collection capability of the Cr-doped TiO
2 device is lower than that of the device made of pristine TiO2, verifying a lower efficiency of the former cell.

It is known that a poor diffusion coefficient of nanocrystalline structures can be explained under the framework of multiple trapping mechanisms, in which the electrons are mostly trapped in the localized states within the semiconductor band gap, from which they can escape by a thermal activation. Therefore, the mechanism of the electron transport in DSCs is entirely dependent on the density and the depth of trap states. The chemical capacitance (Cμ) somehow reflects the capability of a system to accept additional carriers and, conclusively, its value is dependent on the electron contributions from both localized and extended states. However, after the evaluation of the capacitance of a DSC under various applied potentials by Bisquert et al., it was specified that the chemical capacitance of a photoanode was only dominated in the middle region of the potential. At low and high potentials, the dominating capacitances are back layer/counter electrode contribution and Helmholtz capacitance of the device, respectively. The following equation defines the exponential behavior of the chemical capacitance by a potential variation:
(15)
where
C0 represents an equation constant, e is the electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T0 is a parameter with temperature units and indicates the depth of the distributions. Fig. 15 illustrates the calculated chemical capacitance of the TN and CT0.3 solar cells using the fitting results of EIS analysis under dark conditions at different applied potentials. The exponential behavior of the capacitances is detectable in the range from 0.4 to 0.6 V. We observed that the chemical capacitance of the CT0.3 solar cell is higher than that of TN, which may result from the fact that more charge carriers are captured by empty localized trap states.

Based on eqn (15), the slope of the natural logarithm of the chemical capacitance versus potential (the inset of Fig. 15) has an inverse relationship with the depth of trap states. It is evident that not only the introduction of Cr3+ into the TiO2 lattice resulted in a higher density of trap states within the band gap, but also the traps were distributed in a deeper region, leading to the inferior charge transport characteristics of the CT0.3 cell.

In summary, we present a comprehensive study on the effect of chromium doping on the physical, optical and electrical properties of the TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes by fabrication of the DSC devices. Pristine TiO2, as the reference, and Cr-doped TiO2 films with various Cr:Ti atomic ratios were prepared via a straightforward hydrothermal method. XRD and FE-SEM studies showed that no significant change occurred in the morphology, size distribution and crystal structure by the introduction of Cr3+ into the TiO2 lattice. Moreover, doping with chromium resulted in a notable increase in visible light absorption domain and intensity due to the creation of additional energy levels, which led to a significant band gap reduction from 3.14 eV for pristine TiO2 to 1.81 eV for 3 at% Cr-doped TiO2. The electronic band structure of the pristine and Cr-doped TiO2 electrodes was proposed, showing an upward shift of the conduction and valence band edge positions and a reduction in the donor density under doping condition. EIS measurements under the dark condition and the calculation of the chemical capacitance at different applied potentials revealed a higher density of trap states in particular in the deep region of the semiconductor band gap after doping with chromium. Such a phenomenon resulted in the capture of injected charge carriers by empty trap states and, therefore, an increase in their lifetime from 0.21 s for pristine TiO2 to 0.34 s for the CT0.3 cell. In addition, scattering of electrons by deep defects led to inferior transport properties by increasing the transport resistance of the photoanodes from 4.01 Ω cm2 for pristine TiO2 to 10.90 Ω cm2 for the CT0.3 solar cell.
