The printable HTM-free (HTM = hole transport materials) mesoporous carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) are one of the most promising technologies because of their simple production process, lost-cost and excellent stability. In this study, a novel and secure method is used to modify the original graphite, and the obtained chlorinated graphites (C–Clx, x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) are applied to counter electrodes (CEs) in the printing of C-PSCs based on the TiO2/ZrO2/(5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3/C–Clx structure. The experimental results show that C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) can effectively improve the efficiency of C-PSCs. The mesoporous PSCs based on C–Cl0.4 CE have achieved an average efficiency of 11.81%, which is about 1.46-times of the pristine device with carbon CE, and the short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) increased by 15.8%, 11.7% and 11.2%, respectively. Simultaneously, a 30 day aging test showed that PSCs based on (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 and C–Clx CEs showed excellent stability under ambient air conditions.

Organic inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted considerable attention because of their excellent characteristics, such as wide light absorption, high absorption coefficient, adjustable energy gap, long electron–hole diffusion length and low exciton binding energy. The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). towing to advances in materials engineering and interface optimization, the current certified single-junction PSC has a record efficiency of 25.5%.

Improving the crystallization and restraining boundary defects of perovskite crystals are helpful for extracting and transferring of the electrons and holes, which can effectively enhance the performance of the PSCs. Numerous studies have certified that Cl element could improve the crystallization of perovskites. Stranks et al. found that a small amount of Cl doping could extend the diffusion length of perovskites. Rong et al. found that CH3NH3PbI3 doped with a small amount of NH4Cl could effectively improve the PCE of C-PSCs. Optimizing and adjusting the energy level alignment is an effective method for high efficiency PSCs, and lots of excellent works have been done in this regard.
The structures of C-PSCs can be divided into three types: mesoporous, embedded and planar structures. The embedded and planar structures usually need a HTL, such as Spiro-OMETAD. However, hole transparent materials (HTMs) are usually expensive, HTL-free C-PSC is an alternative promising technology in perovskite solar cells because of its simple production process, lost-cost and excellent stability. Mei et al. first used 5-aminovaleric acid (5AVA) in CH3NH3PbI3, and achieved a certified PCE of 12.8% without hole-transport materials (HTMs). A long term stability over 9000 h based on (5AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 and C-PSC structure was carried out. However, due to the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) and inherent ineffective hole selectivity between the perovskite/carbon interface in C-PSCs, PCE is still not comparable to that based on HTM and Au electrodes. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of C-PSCs by optimizing the work function (WF) and increasing the hole-transport efficiency from perovskites to carbon CE. Numerous efforts have been made to improve the performance of C-PSCs, such as modulating the carbon form, designing the device architecture, mixing organic or inorganic HTMs with carbon materials. However, there are only a few studies of PSCs based on regulating the energy level of carbon electrode by direct chemical modifications. In some studies, Cl2 can react with the -H and -OH groups on the graphite surface to form C–Cl bonds, which increases the WF of graphite. Due to the attractive force of Cl to Pb in C–Cl bonds, C–Cl bonds could enhance the effective connection, and reduce the crystal defects of perovskites at the graphite/perovskite interface.
In this study, we innovatively adopted a new and safe method to modify pristine graphite, by which method graphite powder and a sufficient amount of an HCl solution were added to different molars of NaClO solution, respectively, under stirring conditions. The moles of effective Cl2 were 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, and chlorinated graphites (C–Clx, x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) were used in C-PSCs based on the TiO2/ZrO2/(5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3/C–Clx structure. The experimental results showed that C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) can effectively improve the efficiency of C-PSCs. The mesoporous PSCs based on C–Cl0.4 CE have achieved an average efficiency of 11.81%, which is about 1.46-times of the pristine device with carbon CE, and the Jsc, FF and Voc increased by 15.8%, 11.7% and 11.2%, respectively. Simultaneously, a 30 day aging test has showed that C-PSCs based on (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 and C–Clx CE showed an excellent stability under ambient air conditions.

30 g Graphite powder (purchased from XFNano) was added into a 1.5 mol L−1 hydrochloric acid (HCl, purchased from SINOPHARM) solution, and the mixture was stirred overnight under ambient air conditions. Then, the graphite powder were filtered and washed with deionized water until the pH was 7 and after that they were dried at 120 °C.


x ml NaClO solution (x = 113, 226, and 339; NaClO solution was purchased from SINOPHARM with 5.2 wt% effective chlorine) was added into a 180 ml concentrated HCl solution (12 mol L−1) to obtain effective chlorine of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 moles. In order to synthesize chlorine-modified graphite (C−Clx), 3 g of graphite was added to the above mixed solution, sealed with a plastic film, and stirred with a magnetic stirrer under ambient conditions for 12 h. The C–Clx samples were filtered and washed with deionized water to neutrality, and then were finally dried at 120 °C. The washed graphite was the comparative sample.
3 g C–Clx and 1 g carbon black were mixed together, and then moved into an ethanol solution. Subsequently, 0.4 g of ZrO2 powder, 0.5 g of ethyl cellulose and 10 g of terpineol were added in the solution. Then, the mixed solution was vigorously stirred for 12 h via ball milling. The carbon paste was prepared after the ethanol was distilled out from the mixing solution using a rotary evaporator.

Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the HTM-free mesoporous PSCs based on carbon CE. First, an FTO glass was etched by laser, and cleaned with deionized water and alcohol for 15 min, respectively. Second, a compact TiO2 layer was deposited onto the cleaned FTO substrate using a TiCl4 solution by the spray pyrolysis method, and then sintered at 500 °C for 1 h. Third, the mesoporous TiO2 and ZrO2 layers were screen-printed on the TiO2 compact layer successively, and sintered at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the triple-mesoporous structure was sintered at 400 °C for 1 h after the carbon layer was printed on the ZrO2 layer. At last, 4.5 μL of the (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 saturated solution was dropped on the carbon layer, and kept for 5 min to infiltrate into the triple-mesoporous module. After that, the module was moved in an oven and annealed at 50 °C for 6 h.
The morphology and the elemental analysis of the samples were characterized on a JSM-6510 field-emission scanning electron microscope (F-SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a fully resolved Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with copper potassium (k = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Cl 2p were recorded by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the bond information in the sample was obtained by Fourier infrared transmission (FI-TR) spectroscopy. The photo-current voltage characteristics (J–V) and the long-term aging test were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter and a Newport Oriel Sol 3A solar simulator under AM 1.5 under ambient air conditions. The sheet resistance of the carbon film was measured using a KDY-1 four probe analyzer. The interlayer spacing of the (002) plane for the graphite was calculated from the Bragg's equation. The work function of the carbon electrode was measured by Kelvin probe and ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS).

The SEM images of the C–Clx samples are presented in Fig. 2a. Subsequently, the distribution of carbon and chlorine in the C–Clx samples was studied by EDX. Fig. 1b shows the magnified pictures of the red marked section of C–Clx. The element mappings of C and Cl are in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d, respectively, which indicated that Cl elements are distributed in the C–Clx samples. It can be obtained that the ratios of chlorine to graphite in the samples increases as the moles of effective Cl2 increase in Table S1 (ESI). Cl in these samples may origin from the cleaning process of graphite with HCl solution and the strong oxidation of Cl2 produced by the NaClO and HCl mixing solution. The properties of the C–Clx samples were further studied by means of XRD, FT-IR and XPS.

Phosphorus graphite is a sheet-like structure connected by van der Waals force among two-dimensional graphite layers, and the two-dimensional graphite layers are parallel to each other, which inevitably contains numerous distortions and discontinuities. With the action of a strong oxidant Cl2, parts of the functional groups were oxidized and replaced by active Cl atoms. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns and the amplification of (002) of the C and C–Clx, (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) samples. It can be observed that the diffraction angle decreases as the moles of effective Cl2 increases compared to graphite shown in Fig. 3b. According to the Bragg formula, with the increase in the effective Cl2, the spacing between the crystal planes increases from 3.44 Å to 3.45 Å. This may be due to strong oxidizing properties that break the van der Waals bonds of graphite and generate new C–Cl bonds, which increase the distance between the adjacent graphite layers. This process is similar to the production of graphene oxide. Under the combined action of a strong acid and strong oxidant, graphite is oxidized and partially delaminated. With the increase in the strong oxidant content, the spacing distance between adjacent graphite layers rose with the increase in the number of the C–Cl bonds between the graphite layers.
The general XPS spectra of C and C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) samples are presented in Fig. 4a. The amplified pattern of Cl 2p ranging from 160 to 240 eV is shown in Fig. 4b, there is a Cl 2p peak at about 200 eV for C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) but not for C sample, which also indicates the existence of Cl element. Due to spin orbit coupling, the binding energy of Cl 2p appears in the form of double peaks related to the 3/2 and 1/2 energy levels, which are separated by 1.6 eV, as shown in Fig. 3c. The peaks of Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2 caused by the C–Cl bond are observed near 200.5 eV and 202.2 eV, respectively. The deconvolution spectra corresponding to Cl anions are hardly observed (Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2 peaks located at about 197.8 eV and 199.4 eV, respectively). It proves that Cl and C are covalently bonded in the C–Clx samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to further evaluate the chemical structure changes after doping, as shown in Fig. 4d. The significant enhancement of the peak intensity of C–Clx at 880 cm−1 directly proves the existence of C–Cl bonds, and the number of C–Cl bonds in the C–Clx sample is higher than that of the C sample. The FT-IR peaks of all samples at 3425 and 1630 cm−1 can be attributed to H2O in the multi-pores, and those at 1393, 1241 and 1050 cm−1 can be attributed to carboxyl C–O, epoxy/ether C–O and alkoxy/alcohol C–O, respectively. The C–Cl bonds may be derived from the nucleophilic substitution of carboxy-OH. The chemical reaction 2COOH + Cl2 → 2COCl + H2O + 1/2O in the references may explain the possible reactions and the forming of C–Cl bonds in the experimental process of chlorinated graphite sheets.

Fig. 5a shows the schematic structure of the printable mesoporous C-PSCs, in which the dense TiO2 layer, mesoporous TiO2 layer, ZrO2 layer and carbon layer are used as the hole blocking layer, electron transport layer (ETL), insulating layer and counter electrode, respectively. The perovskite solution permeates into the TiO2/ZrO2/C mesoporous scaffold and crystallizes at 50 °C. The cross-sectional pattern of the printable HTL-free mesoporous C-PSCs is shown in Fig. 5b. The thicknesses of the TiO2 layer, ZrO2 and C layer are about 0.65 μm, 1.4 μm and 17 μm, respectively. Fig. 5c shows the energy level alignment schematic of C and C–Cl counter electrodes. Due to the bipolarity and energy level arrangement of the perovskite, holes can be collected by the carbon electrode, and electrons can be effectively injected into the conductive band (CB) of TiO2. The Voc was mainly determined by the difference between the Efn (electron quasi-Fermi level) of TiO2 and Efp (hole quasi-Fermi level) of C or C–Clx CE. The UPS curves of C and C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) are shown in Fig. 5d, which indicate that the work functions of C, C–Cl0.2, C–Cl0.4 and C–Cl0.6 are −4.793, −4.819, −4.831, and −4.831 eV, respectively. C–Clx increases the work function of the carbon electrode, which theoretically leads to a higher Voc and an increasement in the PCE.
In order to investigate the effects of C–Clx for the device, each kind of cells based on C or C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) counter electrodes are measured with 80 PSCs under AM 1.5 under ambient air conditions. The patterns of the statistical (a) Voc, (b) Jsc, (c) FF and (d) PCE of a reverse scan of voltage for C-PSCs are shown in Fig. 6. The average Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of the PSCs based on the C electrode are 0.764 V, 17.83 mA cm−2, 0.59 and 8.09%, respectively. However, when x = 0.4, the PSCs had best average values with Voc = 0.852 V, Jsc = 20.80 mA cm−2, FF = 0.663 and the PCE = 11.75%, which increased by 11.2%, 15.8%, 11.7% and 45.6%, respectively, compared to that of C-based PSCs. The work functions of C, C–Cl0.2, C–Cl0.4 and C–Cl0.6 measured by UPS are −4.793, −4.819, −4.831, and −4.831 eV, respectively. However, the statistical average values of Voc of C, C–Cl0.2, C–Cl0.4 and C–Cl0.6 based PSCs are 0.765, 0.806, 0.852, and 0.825 V in Fig. 6a. The work function of C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) improves the increase in effective Cl2, and when the effective Cl2 is 0.6 mole, the work function remains unchanged. As a contrast, the Voc increases to 0.852 V from 0.765 V, and then decreases to 0.825 V when x = 0.6. The main reason may be that the sheet resistance (R□) of the carbon film had a precipitous increase when the effective Cl2 is 0.6 mole, this may be the reason why the Voc had a decline. The increasing average values of Jsc can be attributed to attraction of Cl towards perovskite, which can improve the crystallinity of the perovskite at the interface, and increased the transparent ability of the holes. In Fig. S4 (ESI), the semicircles represent the resistances of the recombination (Rrec). As the moles of effective Cl2 increases, the values of Rrec increases, which indicates that the devices with less recombination of the electron–hole pairs. The results are consistent with the changing of Jsc. The increase in FF for C–Clx-based devices can be accounted for the attractive force of Cl to Pb in C–Cl bonds, which can reduce the crystal defects of the perovskite at the graphite/perovskite interface. The decline of FF can be attributed to the sharp rising when the effective Cl2 is 0.6. Owing to the increase in Voc, Jsc and FF, the PCE for PSCs based on C–Cl0.4 CE had the highest average efficiency.
Each type of champion PSC was measured, as shown in Fig. 7. The J–V curves of the reverse and forward scans are shown in Fig. 7a. The C–Clx-based PSCs had a serious improvement compared to C-based devices in both reverse and forward scan directions. The highest efficiency solar cell is the C–Cl0.4-based solar cell, which obtained Jsc = 22.86 mA, Voc = 0.864 V, FF = 0.672 and 13.27% PCE. For each kind of the devices, the Jsc of the forward scan is lower than that of the reverse scan. The reason of the hysteresis of Jsc can be attributed to the capacitance between the interfaces. The IPCE curves also certified that the C–Cl0.4-based PSCs owned the best efficiency. The integrated Jsc from the IPCE curves are 15.94, 17.92, 19.33, and 18.22 mA cm−2, which are lower than the counterparts measured from the J–V curves, which may be caused by the nonlinear relationship of the photoelectric conversion under different light intensities. The stabilized current density measured at the bias voltage of the maximum power output of PSCs is in Fig. 7c. It can be seen from the stabilized current density curve that the current has a hysteresis. This is mainly due to the charging process of the capacitance. These curves can be well matched with the formula of the capacitance charging process. When the charging ends, the current in the circuit tends to stabilize. The stabilized current density and power output of each kind of devices are consistent with the performance of the corresponding PSCs.
Finally, the long-term stability of each kind of champion PSCs has been investigated by storage under ambient air conditions without encapsulation, as shown in Fig. 8. The Voc of each kind of devices has a slight increase, which may be the effect of recrystallization in the multi-pores with the help of air and water. The Jsc of all devices increases first, slowly drops, and then remains consistent with the initial value. The FF of the C–Clx-based PSCs had a little increase first, and then remained steady, while FF had a small decline in C-based PSCs. Under the comprehensive influence, the PCE of the C–Cl0.4-based PSCs has a small increase, which shows better stability than that of C-based PSCs in 30 days.

In summary, we adopted a novel and secure method to obtain chlorinated graphite, and fabricated HTL-free mesoporous PSCs based on C, C–Cl0.2, C–Cl0.4 and C–Cl0.6 CEs via a printing method. The experimental results showed that C–Clx (x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) can effectively improve the efficiency of C-PSCs. The mesoporous PSCs based on C–Cl0.4 CE achieved an average efficiency of 11.81%, which is about 1.46-times of the pristine device with carbon CE, and the short-circle current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) increased by 15.8%, 11.7% and 11.2%, respectively. Simultaneously, the aging test showed that C-PSCs based on (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3 and C–Cl0.4 CE exhibited an excellent stability under ambient air conditions. This study provides a new idea and strategy for the safe and cheap production of highly stable mesoporous PSCs.
