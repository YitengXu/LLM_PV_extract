Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their rapidly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is up to 25.5%, comparable to commercial Si-based solar cells. Currently, stability is one of the key obstacles to their commercialization. Compared with organic–inorganic PSCs with volatile organic components, all-inorganic PSCs exhibit excellent thermal stability, and thus have attracted more and more attention in recent years. Among them, PSCs based on CsPbI3 perovskite are the most eye-catching because of its ideal bandgap (1.73 eV) and excellent light absorption. Here, we systematically review strategies to improve the efficiency and stability of CsPbI3 PSCs from their early days to recent advances. The improvement mechanisms are discussed from the aspects of film formation technology, additive engineering, dimensionality engineering, doping engineering and quantum dot technology. In the end, the future development direction and obstacles of CsPbI3 PSCs are also discussed.

In the past ten years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention from both academia and industry due to their high carrier mobility, high light absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, high photoluminescence quantum yields and other optoelectronic properties. The general structural formula of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials is ABX3, where A represents monovalent organic cations, such as CH3NH3+ (MA+) and CH3(NH2)2+ (FA+), B represents divalent metal cations, such as Pb2+, Sn2+, and Ge2+, and X represents monovalent halogen anions, such as I−, Br−, and Cl−. As a promising “game-changer” in the field of solar cells, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 25.5% in just a decade. Although their performances have been developed rapidly in a short period, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are prone to decompose in high temperature, oxygen and humid environments, for which the volatility of the organic components themselves is one of the main reasons.

Wang and coworkers systematically studied the decay mechanism of methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) under the attack of water and oxygen. They proposed the degradation processes as follows. At first, water vapor reacts with the solid perovskite to produce liquid CH3NH3I and solid PbI2. After that, CH3NH3I is decomposed into liquid CH3NH2 and HI. HI can react with O2 and decompose into water and I2; besides, it is also very unstable and will easily decompose into H2 and I2 under high-energy stress like UV light. Finally, the generated water and consumed HI will further promote the occurrence of the whole degradation. The corresponding degradation chemical equations are presented as follows:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
In addition, the intrinsic thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) has also been extensively studied. In 2015, Coning and coworkers reported that MAPbI3 underwent a degradation reaction at 85 °C and transformed into PbI2(s), CH3NH2(g) and HI(g) (eqn (5)). On this basis, Philippe and coworkers found that when the temperature reached 100 °C, the PbI2(s) generated by the degradation of MAPbI3 would be further decomposed into Pb(s) and I2(g) (eqn (6)), thereby promoting the positive progress of reaction (5). In 2017, Latini and coworkers confirmed that the decomposition of MAPbI3 at high temperature includes actually two processes: (1) decomposition into PbI2(s), HI(g) and CH3NH2(g) at 53–134 °C (eqn (7)), and (2) decomposition into PbI2(s), NH3(g) and CH3I(g) and 300–420 °C (eqn (8)). The possibility of process (1) is much higher than that of process (2). Juarez-Perez and coworkers further studied the thermal degradation mechanism of MAPbI3. They found that reaction (5) was a reversible reaction, and reaction (6) was also a reversible reaction under the combined action of light and heat. Finally, the thermal degradation reaction of MAPbI3 is summarized as eqn (9).
Another perovskite material, formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3), with a more appropriate bandgap, has been reported to show better thermal stability than MAPbI3 due to its stronger hydrogen bonding. The reversible degradation reaction of FAPbI3 releasing hydrogen cyanide, formamidine and ammonia at low temperature and C3H3N3 formed by irreversible decomposition at high temperature also occurs (>95 °C) as shown in eqn (10)–(12). So far, there have been divergent opinions on the thermal degradation mechanism of MAPbI3, so it is necessary for researchers to reveal the underlying mechanisms.

Thus, as discussed above, the most classic MAPbI3 perovskite films decompose remarkably at 85 °C; although FAPbI3 films exhibit improved thermal stability compared to MAPbI3 films, decomposition occurs when the temperature increases to 150 °C. Currently, the operating temperature of encapsulated solar cells is generally 50–55 °C, but in some regions, for example for those implemented in deserts, the temperature can reach more than 80 °C at noon in summer. Moreover, the hot-spot's temporary temperature of the solar module could reach as high as >150 °C. Thus, the commonly used organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites meet a high risk of decomposition under long-term operation in these harsh environments.
Compared with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, studies have found that all-inorganic perovskite materials show much stronger stability at high temperature (330 °C). Cs+ is currently the most common inorganic cation used to replace organic cations (MA+ or FA+) in perovskite materials, which could form the CsBX3 perovskite with higher thermal stability. CsBX3 perovskite materials not only exhibit similar photoelectric properties to the above mentioned organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials but also have other advantages, such as smaller exciton binding energy and higher defect tolerance. Thus, CsBX3 perovskite materials are considered as ideal light absorber materials for solar cells. In 2012, Shum and coworkers prepared a CsSnI3 perovskite film for the first time by alternately depositing SnCl2 and CsI on ITO glass, and successfully launched a solar cell using this all-inorganic film as the light absorption layer. Although the PCE was only 0.88%, it laid the basis for the development of all-inorganic PSCs.
For single-junction solar cells, the optimal bandgap that brings the PCE close to its theoretical limit is approximately 1.3 eV. The bandgap of all-inorganic CsBX3 perovskite materials decreases gradually with the increase of halogen anion radius. For example, for the body structure of the cubic phase, CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 have bandgaps of 1.73 eV and 2.3 eV, respectively. The CsPbCl3 crystal with white appearance shows almost negligible absorption in the visible spectrum, indicating a wider bandgap of 3 eV. Therefore, in a variety of all-inorganic perovskite materials, CsBI3 materials may achieve the ideal bandgap for photovoltaic application. CsSnI3, a pure iodine system, has an ideal bandgap (1.3 eV), but it is very unstable because Sn2+ is easily oxidized into Sn4+, making its practical application very difficult. Thus, CsPbI3 has become the hottest inorganic perovskite material in the application of photovoltaic devices. In 2015, CsPbI3 all-inorganic PSCs were first reported, and their glorious life started. The key issues surrounding them such as phase structure stability, carrier transport and defects have been gradually discovered, and strategies based on interface passivation, ion doping and additive engineering have been continuously proposed. So far, the PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs has exceeded 20%, reaching 20.37%, as shown in Fig. 1.
Although the PCE of CsPbI3 all-inorganic PSCs (I-PSCs) has increased rapidly in recent years, there are still some intricate issues that hinder their commercialization. To be committed to addressing these issues, more and more improvement strategies have been reported, and the effect mechanism of these strategies should be deeply discussed. Thus, it is urgent to make a state-of-the-art and comprehensive summary of this aspect to provide valuable comments and theoretical guidance on the further development of CsPbI3 I-PSCs in time. Here, we conducted a systematic review of CsPbI3 I-PSCs from the early stage to the current. First, the basic knowledge of I-PSCs, including the crystal structure of all-inorganic perovskite materials, and the working principle of I-PSC devices are provided, which serves as the foundation for the improvement strategies introduced next. After that, strategies to improve the quality of CsPbI3 films and the research progress in improving the efficiency and stability of I-PSCs are summarized. The improvement mechanisms are discussed from the aspects of additive engineering, dimensionality engineering, doping engineering and quantum dot technology (Fig. 2). The hydrophobic effect of long-chain organic additives, the steric hindrance effect and multifunctional passivation effect of molecular additives, and the crystallization regulation of dimethylammonium and hydrogen iodide are clearly emphasized. Finally, future obstacles including energy loss and upscaling to modules, as well as the development direction of CsPbI3 I-PSCs, are given based on our experience.

The general formula of the crystal structure of all-inorganic perovskite materials is ABX3, as shown in Fig. 3a. The BX6 octahedron forms an extended three-dimensional skeleton, and A+ (Cs+, Rb+, Na+, K+) is located in the octahedral space and stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the A-site cation and the B–X framework. B represents a divalent metal cation (such as Pb2+, Sn2+, and Ge2+), and X represents a monovalent halogen anion (I−, Br−, and Cl−). Representative structures are CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsSnBr3, etc. In addition, some perovskite derivatives of the ABX3 structure have also been discovered, such as Cs2BX6 (Cs2SnI6, Cs2PbBr6, Cs2PbI6), Cs3B2X9 (Cs3Sb2I9, Rb3Sb2I9, Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Bi2I9) and Cs2AgCl6 (Cs3Bi2I9), as shown in Fig. 3b. Some of these derivative materials are lead-free, providing a feasible solution for solving the lead toxicity problem of lead-based perovskites.


The concept of the tolerance factor was first put forward by Goldschmidt in 1926, which is mainly used to describe the structural stability of materials. The formula derived based on a close-packed model is as follows:

(13)
Among them, RA, RB and RX represent the radii of the A-site ion, B-site ion and X-site ion, respectively. Under normal circumstances, cubic perovskite materials can stably exist in the environment generally with t in the range of 0.9–1, as shown in Fig. 3i. However, since the ionic radius of Cs+ (1.69 Å) is smaller than that of MA+ (1.8 Å) or FA+ (1.9–2.2 Å), it is difficult for the tolerance factor (about 0.8) of CsPbI3 to reach this range, which will cause CsPbI3 easily to undergo phase transition and affect the efficiency and long-term stability of the device. In fact, CsPbI3 has four types of phases: α-CsPbI3, β-CsPbI3, γ-CsPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3, as shown in Fig. 3g and h. The t value of CsPbI3 is below the requirement of the cubic phase (α-CsPbI3), so CsPbI3 is usually a non-perovskite yellow phase (δ-CsPbI3) at room temperature. δ-CsPbI3 can transform into cubic α-CsPbI3 at 647 K. When cooling to 554 K, α-CsPbI3 begins to transform into tetragonal β-CsPbI3, which finally transforms into γ-CsPbI3 with an orthogonal structure at 457 K.

The structures of all-inorganic PSCs can be roughly divided into three types: mesoporous structure, planar hetero-junction structure (regular n–i–p structure and inverted p–i–n structure) and structure without hole transport materials.30 The three structures are approximately similar: transparent conductive oxide glass like FTO (Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide) or ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) is used as the front electrode material of the cell, and the perovskite layer is placed between the n-type material (electron transport layer, ETL) and p-type material (hole transport layer, HTL), which looks like a “sandwich”. And the metal or transparent electrode serves as the back electrode, as shown in Fig. 3c, d and f. Commonly used electron transport layer materials are titanium dioxide (TiO2), stannic anhydride (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The commonly used materials for hole transport layers include NiOx, 2,2′,7,7′-tetra-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTD) and polybis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA). The back electrode materials mainly include gold, silver, aluminum, ITO/AZO (aluminum-doped zinc oxide) and carbon, which is sometimes used as both a hole transport material and a back electrode material.

The working principle of I-PSCs is mainly based on the photovoltaic effect, where the potential difference induced by the light is from the uneven semiconductor or the different parts where the semiconductor and the metal are combined. As shown in Fig. 3d, under sunlight, electrons in the valence band of the perovskite material could jump to the conduction band, leaving holes at the top of the valence band. Since the HTL/perovskite layer and the ETL/perovskite layer have built-in electric fields formed by the p–i junction and the n–i junction, respectively, electrons and holes would drift in opposite directions under the action of the built-in electric field; i.e., the holes move toward the positive electrode, while the electrons move in the direction of the negative electrode. Thus, a potential difference is established between the two electrodes, and then a photocurrent is produced.

The key to improving the PCE of all-inorganic PSCs lies in the optimization of the film morphology. Because the film morphology largely affects the photoelectric properties of perovskite films, such as light absorption, carrier diffusion lengths, and carrier transmission and recombination. So far, many thin film deposition techniques have been developed to prepare high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films. At present, solution deposition techniques and vapor deposition techniques are the two main film-forming technologies. Among them, the solution deposition technique mainly includes the one-step solution method and the two-step solution method. The vacuum deposition technique can be divided into dual-source co-evaporation, alternate deposition and sequential deposition according to different evaporation sources and deposition sequences.


The traditional one-step solution method is to dissolve a certain proportion of BX2 and CsX in polar organic solvents (e.g., dimethyl-formamide, DMF, or dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) to make a precursor solution and then spin-coat the fully dissolved precursor solution upon conductive glass. Finally, the required perovskite film is formed after thermal annealing, as shown in Fig. 3j. For organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite films, the thermal annealing temperature is generally about 100 °C to ensure the volatilization of organic solvents and the complete crystallization of crystals. But for the CsPbI3 film, the annealing temperature needs to reach 300 °C or more to form a cubic phase. The film prepared by this method is very sensitive to film deposition conditions, such as annealing temperature, solution concentration, precursor solution composition, and spin coating speed.


The two-step solution method, also known as the inter-diffusion method, is precise and quantitative. Firstly, PbX2 and CsX are dissolved in solvents (DMF or DMSO). Secondly, spin-coat the PbX2 film and then the wet film of PbX2 is annealed at suitable temperature, which is followed by spin-coating an appropriate amount of CsX film on top of the PbX2 film. Finally, through a thermal annealing process, the mutual diffusion and reaction between the two films can be realized to obtain the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 3k. Similarly, the spin-coated PbX2 film can also be directly immersed in the CsX solution so that the reaction can be complete. Compared with the one-step solution method, the two-step solution method can improve the crystallinity of the film and the surface coverage between the layers, showing higher repeatability and better controllability, but having more complicated operation steps. However, the two-step solution method is usually used for fabricating CsPbIBr2 and CsPbBr3 films rather than CsPbI3 films, because of the limited solubility of PbBr2 and CsBr (CsI) in the same organic solvent.


The vacuum deposition technique is a relatively mature film-forming technology, in which perovskite films are prepared by sublimating and depositing PbX2 and CsX precursors. During the deposition process, controlling the ratio of precursors, sublimation rate and annealing temperature is the key to obtaining high-quality inorganic perovskite films. In 2016, Troshin and coworkers used a dual-source co-evaporation method, that is, simultaneously thermally evaporating precursor solutions of CsI and PbI2 to prepare a solar cell with an ITO/c-TiO2/CsPbI3/P3HT/Au structure, and achieved a PCE of 10.5%, as shown in Fig. 5d. Later, Md. and coworkers prepared a CsPbI3 perovskite layer by alternately depositing PbI2 layers and CsI layers with thicknesses of 113 nm and 87 nm under a pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa, as shown in Fig. 3l. Recently, Yang and coworkers reported the use of an alternate deposition technique to control the thickness of precursor materials, and for the first time they prepared CsPbBr3 I-PSCs composed of the derivative CsPb2Br5, as shown in Fig. 3m. CsPb2Br5 located at the grain boundary of CsPbBr3 can increase the grain size of the perovskite, effectively passivate the grain defects and reduce the energy barrier to reduce the recombination of charge carriers. When the value of CsBr:PbBr2 is 1:1.1, this self-passivation can get a PCE of 8.34%. Furthermore, the device has no degradation after aging for more than 1000 h, showing excellent stability. This method has also been used for the preparation of CsPbI3 thin films. In terms of CsPbI3 materials, researchers have found that the performance of the corresponding devices prepared by the vacuum deposition technique (close to 10%) is far superior to that of devices prepared by the solution technique. In 2017, Hutter and coworkers used a time-resolved microwave conductivity technique to measure the carrier mobility of vapor-deposited CsPbI3 samples, which presented a high mobility of 25 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the carrier lifetime exceeded 10 μs, while the carrier lifetime of spin-coated samples was less than 0.2 μs. This showed that the defect density of CsPbI3 films prepared by the solution technology was high, and the mobile charges were quickly fixed at the defect state, which seriously affected the performance of the device. As a result, the vacuum-deposition device gave a PCE of 8.8%, while the device based on the solution method just gave an efficiency of only 6.4%.

The vacuum deposition technique can accurately control the thickness of the film and the film uniformity is very high. Thus, it has outstanding advantages in the preparation of large-area, high-quality inorganic perovskite films. Nonetheless, on account of the different evaporation rate of each halide precursor, precise control of the evaporation ratio of the precursors is a major key factor for this technique. Besides, vacuum deposition usually requires a large high-vacuum cost, which is an important obstacle to commercialization.

CsPbI3 is the most promising all-inorganic perovskite material due to its suitable bandgap for solar cells. The efficiency of PSCs using this material as the active layer has reached 20.37%. Similar to organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, CsPbI3-PSCs also require high quality CsPbI3 films to achieve such high efficiency. Additive engineering is a useful strategy to tune the growth of perovskite films in I-PSCs. In Table 1, the structures and performance of CsPbI3 based PSCs based on additive engineering are summarized.

The bandgap of black α-phase CsPbI3 is about 1.73 eV, and it has an absorption edge at 720 nm that can cover most of the wavelengths of visible light, as shown in Fig. 4a. The theoretical maximum short-circuit current density (JSC) is 22 mA cm−2, and the Shockley–Queisser limit efficiency can reach 28.9%. The tolerance factor of 0.807 is not in the ideal range of 0.9–1, so it cannot maintain a stable black cubic phase (α-CsPbI3) at room temperature, and easily transform into a yellow non-perovskite phase (δ-CsPbI3). To solve this problem, hydroiodic acid (HI) was first added in the precursor to improve the crystallization. Eperon and coworkers prepared the CsPbI3 black phase for the first time in a vacuum of 100 °C by adding a small amount of HI to the CsPbI3 precursor. The introduction of HI caused a slightly strained crystal lattice, which was more likely related to the formation of a more energetically favorable black phase and realized the low temperature preparation of the film. To reveal the underlying reason for the formation of a more energetically favorable black phase and realize the low-temperature preparation of the black phase of CsPbI3 under open-air conditions, Luo and coworkers conducted an in-depth study. They found that this black phase is Cs4PbI6 and explored the phase-transition mechanism from Cs4PbI6 to α-CsPbI3. The results show that when the concentration of HI increases from 33 μL mL−1 to 66 μL mL−1, the solubility of PbI2 in DMF will be inhibited, leading to the formation of a complex, PbI2·DMF, which reacts with CsI to form an intermediate, Cs4PbI6 (Fig. 4b). After IPA treatment, Cs4PbI6 will decompose into stable α-CsPbI3, and the film still appears black after exposure to the environment for 72 hours (Fig. 4d and 5e). The device fabricated by this method achieved a PCE of 4.13%.

To improve the moisture and thermal stability of CsPbI3 PSCs, long-chain or hydrophobic additives have been demonstrated to be effective. These additives’ cations are too large to be incorporated into the 3D perovskite cages, so they bind to the crystal surface as capping ligands and induce the formation of a protective layer on the surface of the CsPbI3 crystal lattice, which effectively isolates the erosion of the crystal lattice by moisture. Fu and coworkers found that using long-chain ammonium additives as the surface capping ligands of CsPbI3 crystals can selectively stabilize the metastable CsPbI3 perovskite structures, and different ammonium ligands can selectively stabilize two different perovskite crystal forms. As shown in Fig. 4c, the positively charged PEA and OA cations can effectively occupy the surface cuboctahedral sites and compensate for the surface charges, which is the combined effects of surface ammonium ligand functionalization and size-dependent effects. As a result, stable cubic α-CsPbI3 perovskite and orthogonal β-CsPbI3 phases were achieved.

Besides organic ammonium, polymer additives can also be used to improve the stability of CsPbI3. They can form an ultrathin tunneling layer to suppress carrier recombination and reduce the surface energy of CsPbI3 crystals. Moreover, large organic cations can also improve the stability of CsPbI3 films due to their hydrophobicity. Li and coworkers reported a surface passivation strategy induced by polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as shown in Fig. 4f. The surface chemical state of the cubic CsPbI3 crystal synthesized in the presence of PVP was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, as shown in Fig. 4g. The results showed that the chemical bond between the amide group of PVP and CsPbI3 increased the electron cloud density on the surface of CsPbI3, which can reduce the surface energy and stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI3 crystals. The passivated cubic phase CsPbI3 showed an ultra-long carrier lifetime (338.7 ns) and diffusion length (1.5 μm), and the resultant PSCs gave a PCE of 10.74%. Fu and coworkers proposed a strategy that used 1,2-bis(chlorodimethylsilyl)ethane (Si-Cl) to achieve humidity-assisted chlorination, thus forming a solid protection layer for perovskites. The Si-Cl molecule could react quickly with water to reduce moisture erosion during the deposition in air. The hydrogen products HCl and 1,2-bis(hydroxyldimethylsilyl)ethane (Si-OH) also act as facilitators for the crystallization and phase stability of CsPbI3. Among them, HCl can chlorinate CsPbI3 and control grain growth for better crystallization, and Si-OH molecules can spontaneously polymerize to form polysiloxane (P-SiO) that fills the crystalline boundary to act as a solid protection layer, as shown in Fig. 4h. Inverted PSCs prepared based on this strategy achieved a PCE of 18.93%, which is the highest PCE of inverted devices reported to date. Furthermore, robust stability was also achieved. Nonencapsulated devices can maintain 93.1% of their original PCE after aging for 1000 h. Thus, introducing long-chain or hydrophobic additives, like large-cation ammoniums or polymers, can form a shielding layer around the CsPbI3 crystals in situ, which passivates the surface defects and prevents the attack of moisture, leading to improved efficiency and stability.

All-inorganic CsPbI3 easily undergoes a phase transition from a cubic black phase to an orthorhombic yellow phase under ambient conditions. It has been reported that the crystal structure of black-phase CsPbI3 features a corner-sharing octahedron, while the yellow phase is an edge-sharing octahedral structure. And the phase transition will experience a complex process of structural changes and component migration. As reported, this phase transition is triggered by moisture, which causes distortion of the corner-sharing octahedron PbI64−. Thus, additives with high steric hindrance were added to hinder the structural changes of CsPbI3, and this strategy has been demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting the distortion of PbI64− and stabilizing the black phase of CsPbI3. For example, Wang and coworkers used hydroiodic acid (HI) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) as additives in CsPbI3 precursor solution to optimize the crystallization process of CsPbI3 and suppress the phase transition of the perovskite through the steric effect, thereby stabilizing the distorted black phase, as shown in Fig. 5a. PSCs prepared with HI and PEAI as mixed additives achieved an efficiency of 15.07%, and the device retained 92% of the initial efficiency after being stored for 2 months under environmental conditions. In 2019, Wu and coworkers proposed a new way to suppress the tilting of the PbI64− unit octahedron in cubic CsPbI3 by systematically controlling the steric effects of the surface organic end groups, which can effectively prevent the phase transition from a cubic black phase to an orthorhombic yellow phase under ambient conditions. In this study, bulky organic ligands serve as organic terminal groups (OTGs). OTG3 with large 2,4-dibutoxy phenyl units (Fig. 5c) can maintain the linearity of the Pb–I–Pb bond and prevent the tilting of the PbI64− octahedron in CsPbI3, thus increasing the phase change resistance under the attack of moisture or polar solvent. In addition, the carboxyl group on the OTG molecule can passivate the surface Pb0 defects, further reduce the non-radiative recombination of carriers in the perovskite layer, and extend the lifetime of the carriers, as shown in Fig. 5d. Through the modification of the perovskite layer with OTG3 molecules, PSCs with an FTO/PTAA(poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine)/CsPbI3-OTG3/PCBM/BCP(Bathocuproine)/Ag structure were prepared, and an efficiency of 13.32% was obtained. After being stored for 7 days in an environment with a relative humidity of 30–40%, the PCE of the CsPbI3-OTG3 based device showed only a 16% decrease, while the control group could be maintained under this condition for only 1 day.

With the continuous in-depth study of all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite materials, Wang and coworkers revealed the essence of the phase transition of CsPbI3 from the perspective of PbI6 octahedrons and proposed a method to stabilize the black phase of CsPbI3 by using multifunctional 4-aminobenzoic acid (ABA) and steric neostigmine bromide (NGBr). The ABA or NG cations adsorbed onto the grain boundary/surface of CsPbI3 anchored the PbI6 octahedron by increasing the octahedral rotation barrier, thus maintaining the continuous corner arrangement of the PbI6 octahedron and kinetically stabilizing the black phase of CsPbI3, as shown in Fig. 5l. In addition, the combination of carboxyl and amine groups in ABA with organic cation NG+ can passivate shallow or deep level defects, that is, uncoordinated Pb2+ and Cs+ vacancies, reducing the defect density from 8.63 × 1015 cm−3 to 3.72 × 1015 cm−3 as shown in Fig. 5k. The prepared PSCs with an FTO/c-TiO2/NGBr-CsPbI3(ABA)/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Au structure exhibited a high efficiency of 18.27% and good stability, which could still be maintained at 90% of the initial efficiency after 500 h of continuous illumination.

Manufacturing thin perovskite films with fewer pinholes and defects is the key to constructing high-performance PSCs. Multifunctional molecular passivators can not only optimize the perovskite layer itself, but also passivate other functional layers, so as to optimize and further improve the performance of the device.

With that in mind, Wang and coworkers reported a stable molecule with dual functions named phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr), and the PTABr spin-coated onto a CsPbI3 film can perform Br gradient doping and PTA+ surface passivation on the film simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 5b. Br gradient doping can induce crystal grain enlargement and improve phase stability. At the same time, the hydrophobic organic PTA+ in PTABr can significantly increase the resistance of the perovskite film to H2O damage. Finally, the champion efficiency of PSCs based on CsPbI3 pretreated with PTABr was as high as 17.06%.
Multifunctional molecular guanidine hydrobromide (GABr) also was found to solve the issue of the low open-circuit voltage caused by the high energy loss (Eloss) of CsPbI3 PSCs. Yan and coworkers used GABr to post-treat the surface of a CsPbI3 film and fabricated solar cells with a PCE of 18.02%. After GABr post-treatment, an ultra-thin GA-CsPbIxBry two-dimensional perovskite film was formed on top of the CsPbI3 film through ion exchange between Br− and I−, which passivated the surface defects of the CsPbI3 film and reduced the non-radiative recombination of carriers. The processed device exhibited a good energy band arrangement, improved the extraction efficiency of carriers, and reduced the charge transfer barrier, as shown in Fig. 5g.
Beyond these, some multifunctional molecules can be directly used in the modification layer to improve the performance of I-PSCs. Yang and coworkers designed and prepared a polyethyleneimine functionalized carbon nanotube (PEI/CNT) interlayer in carbon electrode based PSCs as shown in Fig. 5f. This interlayer connected the perovskite layer and the carbon electrode to effectively solve the problem of poor contact between them and reduce the interface charge transfer resistance. The authors found that the PEI molecule was anchored to the CsPbI3 framework through the coordination between –NH2 (–NH–) and Pb2+, effectively passivating the trap states on the surface of the perovskite (Fig. 5f). Due to the dual role of the PEI/CNT interlayer, the PCE of PSCs reached 10.55%, and the non-encapsulated device based on PEI/CNT exhibited higher stability in air with high humidity (70%) and at high temperature (80 °C).
There are some multifunctional molecules that can also be used as lower interface modification layers of perovskite layers to further alleviate the VOC deficit and FF loss of devices, which are mainly caused by the defects in the bulk and surface/grain boundaries of inorganic perovskites and the mismatch of energy bands between the perovskite and charge transport layers. Recently, it has been reported that the surface of the TiO2 layer is rich in hydroxyl and other hanging bonds, which may form a deep trap state and cause carrier recombination. Liu and coworkers found that the multifunctional molecule 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalate (ATPA) with both carboxylic acid and amine groups could not only solve the above problems but also effectively passivate the defects of the CsPbI3 surface. The carboxylic acid could react with the dangling hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface, anchoring the surface and reducing the defects on the TiO2 surface, while ATPA could also provide several bonding sites such as N-Pb and O-Pb to passivate the dangling Pb bonds, thereby suppressing the interfacial trap-assisted recombination, as shown in Fig. 5h. In addition, ATPA located between TiO2 and CsPbI3 can also act as a modified layer, improving the cascade energy level matching between TiO2 and CsPbI3, effectively improving the extraction and transportation of carriers. Based on the ATPA-modified TiO2 substrates, optimized CsPbI3 PSCs delivered a PCE of 18.12% with suppressed hysteresis.
In order to stabilise the α-phase of CsPbI3, Wang and coworkers added a small amount (∼1.5 wt%) of sulfobetaine zwitterions to CsPbI3 precursor solution. Small CsPbI3 particles with an average size of ∼30 nm were obtained. Experiments showed that zwitterions can hinder the crystallization of the CsPbI3 film through the electrostatic interaction of ions and colloids, leading to the formation of small particles, which would increase the surface area of the crystal grains and stabilize the α-CsPbI3 phase, as shown in Fig. 5e and 6i. However, the zwitterion molecules located in the CsPbI3 grain boundary will reduce the extraction and transport of carriers, thereby leading to a decreased current density of the device. In order to solve this problem, the authors performed Ar plasma treatment on the perovskite film to remove excess zwitterion molecules, and finally they got a PCE of 11.4%.
Afterward, Ye and coworkers reported an oriented attachment strategy to form a highly oriented quasi-single-crystal black phase CsPbI3 film by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The predominant adsorption of the dimethyl sulfoxide ligand on the (212) crystal plane of the yellow phase of δ-CsPbI3 induced the accumulation of small units of δ-CsPbI3, which formed a relatively oriented structure. During the annealing process, the orientation adjustment of the δ-CsPbI3 crystal grains and the phase transformation of the δ-CsPbI3 crystal to the α-CsPbI3 crystal were realized, forming a highly oriented (200) crystal plane quasi-single crystal black phase CsPbI3 microstructure film, as shown in Fig. 5j. And the efficiency of the device increased from 13.4% to 16.0%.
Recently, Fu and coworkers used methylammonium pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (MAPyA) as a post-treatment agent for in situ repair and stabilization of CsPbI3 thin films, and achieved the highest efficiency of 16.67% for inverted-CsPbI3 PSCs. They found that MAPyA can be decomposed into methylamine (MA) gas and pyridine-2-carboxylate (PyA−) ions at 100 °C. MA gas can repair the non-compact CsPbI3 layer, and PyA− located on the grain boundary and surface of CsPbI3 has a strong interaction with CsPbI3, which can play a role in passivation and block water vapor, as shown in Fig. 5n. The nonencapsulated device still maintained 81.31% of the initial efficiency after 1800 minutes of outdoor operation with a relative humidity of 30%. The efficiency record of the regular-CsPbI3 PSCs was refreshed again. Yoon and coworkers reported a sequential dripping of a methylammonium chloride (MACl) solution (SDMS). By controlling the intermediate stage of the crystallization process and using octylammonium iodide (OAI) in ambient air to passivate the surface of the perovskite layer, a highly uniform film with fewer pinholes was obtained. The PSCs prepared with this film as the photoactive layer obtained a VOC of 1.2 V and a PCE of 20.37%, which was the highest efficiency of CsPbI3-based PSCs reported to date.
Currently, even by using additive engineering and surface passivation, the carrier lifetime of pure CsPbI3 in these PSCs is only in the range of 10–20 ns. This means that defects in bulk CsPbI3 films play a more fundamental role in causing carrier recombination of the PSCs. Therefore, it is of high significance to focus more efforts on exploring effective approaches to eliminating bulk defects of CsPbI3. Yu and coworkers developed a urea-ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt modification strategy and fabricated PSCs with a PCE of 20.08%, as shown in Fig. 6a. The NH4+-urea supramolecular cations formed by hydrogen bonding can weaken the Coulomb bond between the cation and the SCN− anion so that the SCN− and Pb-I octahedrons had a strong coordination effect and improved the quality of CsPbI3 crystals and the film's morphology. After modification, the defects of the film and non-radiative charge recombination were significantly suppressed, and a single exponential charge recombination life of up to 31.7 ns was obtained. Moreover, other multifunctional polymers or molecules have also been discovered to improve the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells, such as (adamantane-1-yl) methylammonium (ADMA), Zn(C6F5)2 and camphor sulfonic acid (CSA).

HI or DAMI ((CH3)2NH2I) has been demonstrated to be an efficient and mysterious additive for the preparation of high quality CsPbI3 films. This additive engineering method is nearly one of the most useful strategies to fabricate high-efficiency CsPbI3 PSCs. Almost every huge breakthrough in the efficiency of PSCs is closely related to this additive, but the chemical mechanism of HI or DAMI has always been controversial. Therefore, in this part, we focus on a brief review of the development of this additive. Eperon and coworkers used HI as an additive for the first time, and achieved a low-temperature preparation of a black CsPbI3 film with a smooth and flat surface. Next, Luo and coworkers found that HI can improve the solubility of CsI and PbI2 precursors in DMF, thereby realizing the transformation of the perovskite from yellow to black under low temperature conditions. In addition, his team also explored the effects of different concentrations of HI on film formation, providing theoretical guidance for further revealing the mechanism of HI. With the continuous advancement of research, it was found that HI can react with PbI2 in DMF solution to produce HPbI3. Xiang and coworkers found that, by using HPbI3 instead of PbI2 in the one-step solution method, a highly stable α-CsPbI3 film can be prepared in dry air in the temperature range of 20–30 °C and in the humidity range of 10–20%, as shown in Fig. 6c. Due to the existence of the stretched lattice, the bandgap of α-CsPbI3 was reduced from 1.73 eV to 1.68 eV, which broadened the light absorption range (increased from 720 nm to 740 nm) and increased the short-circuit current, as shown in Fig. 6e. The film was applied to carbon-based PSCs without a hole transport layer, and a PCE of 9.5% was obtained. After storage in dry air for 3000 hours, the device without encapsulation could still be maintained at more than 90% of the initial efficiency.

Although HPbI3 as an additive had made remarkable achievements in improving the performance of PSCs, its mechanism for stabilizing black CsPbI3 was still unclear. Even the existence of HPbI3 was questionable, since HI cannot be combined with metal, and HPbI3 was easily dissociated into PbI2 and HI. Ke and coworkers believed that HPbI3 did not exist, and actually Cs1−xDMAxPbI3 (x = 0.2 to 0.5) were obtained after adding HI to perovskite precursor solution. They treated the precursor solution with HI and DMAI separately, and performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection on both. The results showed that the peak ratios of –NH2+– and –CH3 obtained by the films treated with the two different additives were 1:3, as shown in Fig. 6d. This phenomenon showed that DMA+ was formed through the side reaction of DMF with HI; it then combined into the CsPbI3 film to form a mixed A-site perovskite.
Marshall and coworkers further explored and quantified the impact and limitations of the production method of DMA+ partially replacing Cs+. They found that the perovskite could form a stable phase only when 25% DMA+ replaced Cs+. When the concentration of DMA+ increased, significant phase separation (CsPbI3 and DMAPbI3) occurred. Pei and coworkers also believed that the existence of HPbI3 intermediates was inaccurate. They used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to confirm that the hydrolysate of HI and DMF is DMAI3. After that, they dissolved DMAPbI3 powder and CsI in DMF to prepare a perovskite-type precursor solution, and prepared Cs0.5DMA0.5PbI3-PSCs with a PCE of 14.3% by a two-step annealing (140 °C + 180 °C) method. Without encapsulation, the device maintained an initial efficiency of 85% after being exposed to air (20% RH) for 20 days. Recently, Wang and coworkers put forward a new point of view; that is, DMAI was a volatile additive and could not be doped into the crystal lattice of CsPbI3.Fig. 6h shows that under different atmospheres (argon and dry air) with the same relative humidity, DMAI started to sublime at 170 °C and 90 °C respectively. This also showed that DMAI was an additive whose volatility was related to moisture. In addition, the result of Fig. 6i showed that a strong correlation peak with –NH2+–(DMA+) appeared in the perovskite film after 5 s annealing. However, as the annealing progressed, the DMA+ signal weakened and disappeared completely in the Cs-1.5DMAI sample annealed in the last 5 minutes. This also confirmed that there was no residual DMAI in the final CsPbI3 perovskite film, and the possibility of incorporating DMA+ into the CsPbI3 lattice can be completely ruled out.
With the continuous development of research, the voice of “The true face of HPbI3 is DMAI3” is getting louder and the evidence is getting more and more abundant. Although DMA+ plays an important role in the preparation of efficient and stable CsPbI3 PSCs, there is still a long way to go to truly understand its optimization mechanism.

According to the principle of ionic coordination and Pauling rules, large ion radius additives can’t adapt to the 3D skeleton of the PbI64− octahedron, but will separate the 3D structure into low-dimensional ones. Reduced dimensional perovskites have been demonstrated to exhibit robust moisture stability. The structures and performance of CsPbI3 based PSCs with dimensional engineering are summarized in Table 2.

The in situ formation of a reduced dimensional perovskite layer via post-synthesis ion exchange has been proved to be an effective way to improve the stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. However, due to the strong ion binding energy of Cs+ in cesium-based inorganic perovskites, it is difficult to apply this technology to all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. Liao and coworkers introduced butylammonium cations into 3D CsPbI3 to transform it into a stable layered cesium iodine lead perovskite (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2CsPb2I7. This layered structure does not require anti-solvent treatment to obtain a film with a smooth surface and good thermal stability, which is conducive to the separation and transportation of carriers. Although the solar cell with (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2CsPb2I7 as the active layer only obtained a PCE of 4.84%, its efficiency (non-encapsulated) can be maintained at 92% of the initial efficiency after being placed in an environment of 30% RH for 30 days, as shown in Fig. 6f.
Phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), which was first proposed by Liu and coworkers, is a star additive in PSCs. It can not only passivate the vacancy defects of Cs and I on the CsPbI3 surface, but is also widely used as an additive for reducing dimensions to generate 2D and quasi-2D perovskite structures, thus improving the stability of the device.
Jiang and coworkers used CsAc and HPbI3 to prepare a high-quality CsPbI3 perovskite film with a thickness of above 500 nm, but the film had poor stability, and was prone to phase change. To overcome this problem, they added an appropriate amount of PEAI to the CsPbI3 system to induce the formation of quasi-2D perovskite PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1, as shown in Fig. 6g. Studies showed that the quasi-2D perovskite can greatly inhibit the phase transition and significantly reduce the defects of the film, which greatly improves the long-term stability of the device. As a result, the corresponding PSCs obtained a PCE of 12.4%. And the efficiency of the nonencapsulated device (n = 40) was only reduced by 7% after being placed for 40 days under atmospheric conditions. Dayan and coworkers used two different barrier molecules, i.e. linear (HA) and aromatic (PEA) barrier molecules to prepare low-dimensional CsPbI3, as shown in Fig. 6j. And starting from two different barrier molecules, stabilities under continuous light and different humidities were analyzed. It was found that PEA was more stable than HA under continuous light (700 h vs. 72 h). This can be attributed to the different defects of the HA and PEA barriers. Linear barriers can cause atomic point defects, which can pull iodine atoms from the surface of the perovskite. The aromatic barrier leads to extended defects, which increases the distance between the PbI2 crystal plane and the I-Cs crystal plane. The scale-up experiment proved that the defects in the PEA based devices tend to aggregate and the formation energy does not vary linearly with the size of the system, but the defects formed in the HA based devices have statistical characteristics. Therefore, the stability of the aromatic barrier film is higher than that of the linear barrier film. This research provided theoretical guidance for stabilizing the black phase of CsPbI3.
Liu and coworkers used a 2D PEA2PbI4 perovskite layer to modify the surface termination of the CsPbI3 grain boundary, as shown in Fig. 6k. The PEA2PbI4 in the grain boundary not only enhanced the extraction and transport of charge carriers but also effectively inhibited non-radiative recombination. The device based on 2D perovskite modification had a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 18.82% and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V. In addition, because 2D PEA2PbI4 can prevent moisture and oxygen from penetrating the grain boundary, the 2D modified CsPbI3 film showed remarkable stability against humidity. After being stored at a relative humidity of 40 ± 5% for 84 hours, the nonencapsulated device could still retain 81% of the initial efficiency. Besides the additive strategy, low-dimensional perovskites can be formed by the post-treatment method. However, unlike well-known organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, studies by Zhao and coworkers showed that this post-treatment using traditional organic cation halide salts, such as PEAI, didn’t lead to the formation of low-dimensional perovskites. This is because the binding strength of Cs ions in the inorganic perovskite is so strong that the ions cannot be extracted from the lattice, which leads to the termination of surface organic cations, rather than the insertion of organic cations. To solve this problem, Liu and coworkers reported for the first time a special CsPbI3 film post-treatment agent called quaternary ammonium salt (TBAI), which has strong binding energy, as shown in Fig. 6l. The experiment showed that tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) ions can intercalate and repair CsPbI3 with organic cations through the ion exchange reaction. This cation can intercalate into the PbI64− octahedral structure and exchange the Cs+; thus the two connected layers fractured and the 3D perovskite structure collapsed and then a 1D TBAPbI3 protective layer was in situ formed. This protective layer could not only improve the stability of the CsPbI3 phase but also repair the defects on the surface of the perovskite layer, increasing the PCE of the device from the original 15.85% to 18.32%.
Besides 2D, quasi-2D and 1D perovskites, 0D perovskite can also be used to stabilise the phase of α-CsPbI3. Bai and coworkers prepared a heterogeneous structure composed of 0D Cs4PbI6 and 3D γ-CsPbI3 by adjusting the stoichiometric ratio of the precursors between CsI and PbI2. The in situ 0D Cs4PbI6 crystals can be used as molecular locks to enhance the phase stability of 3D CsPbI3 and passivate the film defects (Fig. 6b). The authors obtained high stability PSCs with a PCE of 16.39%. This method can be easily achieved without the additives mentioned above, so there is great potential for application in large scale and module directions.

In addition to additive engineering and dimensional engineering strategies, doping engineering is also widely used to improve the performance of all-inorganic PSCs. In doping engineering, small amounts of other ions are incorporated into the lattice or bulk film of CsPbI3 to improve its electrical properties and structural stability. The structures and performance of ion doped CsPbI3 based PSCs are summarized in Table 3.

According to formula (13), increasing the radius of A-site ions can increase the value of t, making it close to or in the stable range of 0.9–1. In addition, they also can significantly improve the crystallization process of CsPbI3, thus obtaining pinhole-free films with large grains and reduced defects. The ionic radii of commonly used cations and anions in CsPbI3 perovskites are summarized in Table 4. Xiang and coworkers doped Na+ into the A site of CsPbI3 to generate Cs0.95Na0.05PbI3, which not only improved the morphology of the perovskite film but also adjusted the energy band level of the CsPbI3 film, as shown in Fig. 7b. The adjustment of the band level of the CsPbI3 film can increase the built-in potential and VOC. Applying this method to C-PSCs, an efficiency of 10.7% and an open-circuit voltage of 0.92 V were obtained.

Although increasing the radius of A-site ions can increase the value of t, it is difficult to find ions larger than Cs+ in the periodic table of chemical elements. Consequently, it is expected to increase t and phase stability by substitutional doping for B-sites with other metal ions. In addition, excessive doping ions tend to accumulate on grain boundaries and the surfaces of perovskite films, passivating grain boundaries and reducing the defect density on the film surface. Wang and coworkers added YbCl3 as a bifunctional additive to a precursor solution of the perovskite, which made it possible to obtain high-quality and stable α-phase CsPbI3 films at 80°C. Yb3+ partially replaces Pb2+ to increase the tolerance coefficient and promote the formation of the α-phase. In addition, YbCl3 reacts with DMSO in the precursor solution to form an adduct, YbCl3·DMSO. This adduct will passivate the perovskite film, reduce defect density, and stabilize the α black phase. The films could be maintained at room temperature for more than 90 days. The modified device achieved an efficiency of 12.4%.
Recently, Li and coworkers found that doping with InI3 can hinder the formation of the intermediate phase and control the growth rate of crystals so that stable, high-quality thin films with coarse grains and few voids can be obtained. This result can be confirmed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 7d. The smaller carrier transfer resistance RSH and larger carrier mobility also lead to an increase in the efficiency of the doped device from 14.36% to 17.09%. Furthermore, the efficiency of nonencapsulated PSCs:InI3 remained at 77% of the initial value after aging at room temperature for 860 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere.
In addition to promoting the tolerance factor of the lattice and passivating film surface defects, the strategy can also effectively adjust the bandgap of CsPbI3. Hu and coworkers first attempted to partially replace the B position in CsPbI3 with Bi3+ to stabilize α-CsPbI3 at room temperature. The doping with Bi3+ could not only increase the tolerance factor t of the material but also reduce the bandgap to 1.56 eV. In addition, the doping with Bi3+ increased the micro-strain of the crystal structure, which forced the crystal structure to maintain high symmetry. Finally, a flat and dense film was obtained and the fabricated device with an FTO/c-TiO2/CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3/CuI/Au structure achieved an efficiency of 13.21%. Inspired by this, Lau and coworkers used Ca2+ to dope CsPbI3 to stabilize the black α phase. The introduction of Ca2+ reduced the size of the colloid in the precursor solution, making the film nucleation and crystallization reactants more uniformly dispersed. Besides, Ca2+ could form a calcium-rich oxide layer on the surface of the perovskite film, which could play a passivating role in increasing the carrier life of the device. Thus, after doping, larger crystals and a flatter film were obtained, and the VOC and FF of the Ca2+ doped PSCs were improved with a PCE of 13.5%.
Mn2+ can also act as doping ions to stabilize the crystal lattice of CsPbI3. The doping with Mn2+ can shrink the CsPbI3 lattice, improve the formation energy and increase the tolerance factor of the CsPbI3 lattice. Compared to the CsPbI3 lattice without doping, the lattice shrinkage and higher Mn–I bond dissociation energy can stabilize the lattice and surface of CsPbI3. Yao and coworkers added 2% Mn2+ to CsPbI3 according to the above mechanism and prepared PSCs with TiO2 and PTAA as electron and hole transport layers, respectively. The PCE of 2% Mn2+-doped PSCs was 16.52%.
Moreover, Yao and coworkers incorporated SCN− as a pseudohalide into a CsPbI3 film, and obtained a film with larger crystal size and fewer defects. The PL results showed that when the Pb(SCN)2 addition amount was 2%, the intensity of the photoluminescence spectrum of the film was the strongest and the photoelectric performance was the best, as shown in Fig. 7c. The optimized CsPbI3 based on 2% Pb(SCN)2 gave a PCE of 17.04%.
From the above discussion in this section, doping engineering can adjust the lattice structure and bandgap of the CsPbI3 material, regulate the crystal growth of the perovskite film, and thus effectively improve the efficiency and stability of I-PSCs. Here, it should be noted that, although B-site doping has lots of advantages, this strategy also changes octahedral factors when promoting the t of CsPbI3, which may affect the stability of the anion sub-lattice. In particular, if the size of the B-site cation is too small to support the PbI64− octahedron, a four-fold coordinated hexahedron will be formed, thus destroying the structure of the perovskite. Therefore, the effect of B-site doping on the stability of CsPbI3 perovskite is very complex and needs further study.

As described in Section 2.2, CsPbI3 has three perovskite phases including cubic (α, Pm3m), tetragonal (β, P4/mbm) and orthorhombic (γ, Pbnm), as shown in Fig. 4e. Crystal structure has an important effect on the photoelectric performance of CsPbI3; for example, the bandgaps of these three structures are 1.73 eV, 1.68 eV and 1.75 eV, respectively, wherein the perovskite structure of the β-phase has a more suitable bandgap. Furthermore, the α-phase generally needs to be prepared at high temperature, but the phase transition temperatures of the β-and γ-phases are relatively lower, so the β- and γ-phases have higher stability than the α-phase at room temperature. Because of these, the β-phase and γ-phase of CsPbI3 have also been developed and applied to PSCs in recent years. The structures and performance of metastable phase CsPbI3 based PSCs are summarized in Table 5.

γ-CsPbI3 is considered to be the most stable metastable phase due to its lowest free energy and the most stable Brillouin double wells. And the steps for preparing stable γ-CsPbI3 thin films are very simple, which involve adding a small amount of H2O to the perovskite precursor and using a one-step spin coating method. Studies have found that H2O molecules can delicately adjust the balance of the proton transfer reaction in the precursor solution by adjusting the size of the perovskite lattice, thereby stabilizing the perovskite phase, as shown in Fig. 7e. Through the density functional theory calculation on an extended surface area exceeding 8600 m2 mol−1, it was found that γ-CsPbI3 had lower surface free energy and higher thermal stability than δ-CsPbI3. Besides, γ-CsPbI3 also exhibited optoelectronic properties comparable to α-CsPbI3.
Later, Wang and coworkers used previous methods to synthesize γ-CsPbI3 and introduced 3% Cl− into it to improve the surface morphology and crystal orientation of the film. The optimized film has higher conductivity, higher carrier mobility and lower trap density, as shown in Fig. 7f. The corresponding PSCs with Cl− gave a high PCE of 16.07%. After 200 hours of continuous light soaking, the PCE was only reduced by 0.45%. Even if exposed to air (25 °C, 20–30% RH) for 60 days, its PCE could still be maintained at 94% of the initial PCE. Recently, Chen and coworkers synthesized a high-quality γ-CsPbI3 film using brominated dimethyl phenylenediamine (PhDMADBr) at 60 °C. An appropriate amount of PhDMADBr can not only anchor the cations of γ-CsPbI3 to inhibit the phase degradation of the perovskite but also use bromide ions to passivate the iodine vacancies in γ-CsPbI3, thus improving the phase stability and device performance. The PSC based on the modified γ-CsPbI3 film obtained a PCE of 12.71%, and the device still retained 85% of the initial efficiency after being placed for 1000 hours.
The above methods are based on γ-CsPbI3 that is deposited by the solution method, but it is difficult to apply this method to industrial-scale production. Therefore, Zhang and coworkers deposited a high-quality γ-CsPbI3 perovskite layer by co-evaporation of PbI2 and CsI with a small amount of PEAI. Their results showed that the co-evaporation method and the addition of PEAI to the perovskite layer led to preferred crystal orientation and a significantly improved microstructure, with columnar domains protruding through the entire film thickness. As a result, the defect density of the film could be reduced. As shown in Fig. 7i, the photoluminescence intensity of the CsPbI3 film gradually increased and the Urbach energy gradually decreased as the concentration of PEAI increased. After optimization, the PCE of the device was as high as 15%, and with encapsulation thermally evaporated perovskite devices could maintain their efficiency for more than 215 days.
As for β-CsPbI3, Mahato and coworkers reported a colloidal synthesis method to prepare air-stable β-CsPbI3 nanorod films by post-annealing a γ-CsPbI3 film at 150 °C. Compared with γ-CsPbI3, the β-CsPbI3 nanorod films exhibited improved structural stability due to the distorted free unit cell. And, in order to solve the energy loss caused by the charge recombination at the β-CsPbI3/transport layer interface, Wang and coworkers designed a beach chair-shaped band structure (CSB), that is, spin-coating CsPbI3 QDs and phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PMABr) layers on each side of the perovskite layer to introduce an energy level gradient, as shown in Fig. 7g. The study showed that a reasonable CSB structure can not only enhance the charge transfer from the CsPbI3 film to the electrode, but also inhibit the interface recombination of carriers. In addition, the PMABr layer in the TiO2/CsPbI3 film interface can provide the functions of passivation, gradient Br doping and CsPbI3 QDs capping, which can reduce the interface defect density and improve the PCE of the device (17.12%). Recently, Wang and coworkers prepared a β-CsPbI3 film with an extended spectral response and enhanced phase stability. They used synchrotron X-rays to reveal the existence of highly oriented β-CsPbI3 crystal grains. After that, choline iodide (CHI) was used to process the β-CsPbI3 film, which can not only reduce the cracks and pinholes in the perovskite layer but also increase the carrier lifetimes and improve the energy level matching of each interface. Finally, the modified devices achieved a PCE of 18.4%, as shown in Fig. 7h.
As discussed in this section, besides the cubic phase CsPbI3, the black metastable phase including tetragonal (β, P4/mbm) and orthorhombic (γ, Pbnm) phases of CsPbI3 have great potential to achieve both high efficiency and stability. In the future, improvement in these kinds of CsPbI3 should be developed and various related additives should be further explored.

To solve instability problem of the α-CsPbI3 phase at room temperature, trimming the α-CsPbI3 bulk material into quantum dots (QDs) is another useful strategy. It provides a method for colloidal synthesis of perovskites, which separates the growth of crystal grains from the deposition of thin films. All-inorganic perovskite QDs were first synthesized by Kovalenko and coworkers through the hot-injection method, which announces the launch of a new field into optical nanomaterials. Colloidal CsPbI3 QDs are obtained by reacting the Cs-oleate with predissolved PbI2 in a high boiling point octadecene solvent at 140–200 °C, and after a few seconds, the reaction system cools rapidly to room temperature with an ice-bath. However, heat injection usually requires a high reaction temperature and inert atmosphere, which severely limits their practical application. In order to overcome these shortcomings, in 2016, Swarnkar and coworkers synthesized an α-CsPbI3 quantum dot film by a ligand assisted reprecipitation method at room temperature and applied it in PSCs for the first time. The film was purified with methyl acetate, which can maintain the α-phase unchanged for several months under environmental conditions. Based on this film, the prepared PSCs as shown in Fig. 7j achieved 10.77% and a VOC of 1.23 V. Since then, many effective synthesis strategies of high-quality CsPbI3 QDs have been reported.


The reason why α-CsPbI3 quantum dots have better stability than α-CsPbI3 poly-crystals is that quantum dots have a higher surface area ratio and lower surface energy. The unique surface states and surface ligands together maintain the stability of the α-CsPbI3 quantum dots. Among them, oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) were some common long-chain ligands (containing 18 carbon atoms, C18). They usually have disadvantages such as strong dynamics, easy desorption from the as-prepared CsPbI3 QDs’ surfaces, and inhibited carrier transportation. To solve the above problems, Chen and coworkers introduced octanoic acid (OctAc) and octylamine (OctAm) with short chains (containing 8 carbon atoms, C8). The density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the absorption energies of the capped surfaces of OctAc (2.993 eV) and OctAm (5.022 eV) are much greater than those of the capped surfaces of OA (2.449 eV) and OLA (4.599 eV), as shown in Fig. 8a. That was to say, the adsorption of C8 on the surfaces of quantum dots was much stronger than that of C18, which can alleviate the dynamic properties of ligands, reduce the loss of ligands on the surfaces of the quantum dots, and inhibit the formation of new defects caused by the loss of ligands. C8/C18 co-terminated CsPbI3 quantum dots show better cubic phase stability (>180 days) and higher efficiency (11.87%) than the C18-terminated CsPbI3 in solution.

Inspired by this, Jia and coworkers used glycine as a dual ligand and used a one-step ligand exchange strategy to passivate the surface defects of CsPbI3 QDs, as shown in Fig. 8b. The results showed that compared with the traditional MeOAc rinsing method that induces a large number of vacancies on the surfaces of the quantum dots, glycine can simultaneously passivate the cesium vacancies and iodine vacancies on the surfaces, thereby reducing the recombination of carriers of the film. In addition, the short alkyl chain of glycine can also improve the charge transfer capacity between individual quantum dots and further improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. The final PCE of glycine-based perovskite quantum dot solar cells was as high as 13.66%. Recently, Wang and coworkers prepared high quality CsPbI3 QDs by adding a tailored organic ligand triphenyl phosphite (TPPI) into MeOAc solution, and achieved amazing results. This bulky conductive ligand exhibits strong bonding to the QD surface and further balances the carrier transport. As a result, the electrical coupling between CsPbI3 QDs is enhanced, leading to improved charge transport, reduced carrier recombination, and then simultaneously high VOC (1.23 V) and fill factor (79.45%) values.
Although the long-chain ligands and insulating ligands in the CsPbI3 quantum dot film could be replaced with short-chain ligands, the traditional method based on formamide (FA) replacement also removed the hydrophobic protective layer, which would open a channel for moisture penetration and lead to poor device stability. To avoid this disadvantage, Kim and coworkers used PEAI to post-process an Ac-exchanged CsPbI3 QD film and replaced the long-chain insulating OLA ligand with PEA+, as shown in Fig. 8c. The study showed that the OLA ligand was successfully exchanged to the short-chain hydrophobic PEA+ while maintaining the size, shape, composition and Eg properties of the CsPbI3 quantum dots. The PEAI-doped CsPbI3 quantum dot solar cells exhibited a high efficiency of 14.1% and maintained more than 90% of the initial efficiency after being stored for 15 days under environmental conditions of 20–25% RH.
Even though there has been improvement of CsPbI3 QD PSCs by ligand exchange, removing the long-chain OA or OLA ligands usually causes the exposure of the bare surfaces of the QDs. Thus, the resulting QD film is easily penetrated by moisture. Furthermore, recent reports demonstrate that the surface Pb2+ may lead to surface trap states and cause the formation of surface positive charges. So choosing a greater surface bonding strength short-chain ligand that can interact with Pb2+ is critical. Khan and coworkers reported the use of bifunctional p-mercaptopurine ligand (4-MP) to post-process a CsPbI3 film to adjust the anchoring position of the ligand on the surfaces of the CsPbI3 quantum dots. Compared with OA and OLA long-chain ligands, the bifunctional 4-MP ligands showed greater anchoring strength on the surfaces of the quantum dots, and the CsPbI3 quantum dot film after passivation showed stronger electronic coupling and fewer defect states. Finally, a PSC with an efficiency of 14.25% was prepared. After the device was stored in a dry environment (<5% RH) for 70 days, the efficiency could still be maintained at 80% of the original value.
Due to the crystal characteristics of perovskite quantum dots, the surface matrix would form a lot of iodine vacancies after separation and purification with MeOAc. These surface defects seriously affected the photoelectric properties and stability of the perovskite QDs. In order to solve these problems, Jia and coworkers proposed a “surface matrix curing” (SMC) strategy, which used tert-butyl iodide (TBI) and nucleophile trioctylphosphine (TOP) to take a single-molecule nucleophilic substitution (SN1) reaction to repair the iodine vacancy defects in the perovskite QD surface matrix, thereby significantly suppressing the trap-assisted carrier recombination. The SMC-treated device achieved a PCE of 16.21%, which is the highest PCE achieved by PSCs based on CsPbI3 QDs reported so far.

In recent years, CsPbI3 quantum dots have been enthusiastically sought after in optoelectronic devices due to their adjustable sizes and bandgaps, high defect tolerance and good phase stability. The structures and performance of CsPbI3 QD based PSCs are summarized in Table 6.

Although PSCs based on CsPbI3 quantum dots can obtain higher VOC, the increase in the thickness of the photoactive layer (to increase the light absorption) limits the carrier extraction efficiency of the film and ultimately reduces the device's JSC. This is a common trade-off dilemma in quantum dot solar cells. In addition, because the quantum dots are relatively separated in the thin film, the conductive resistance of the thin film is very high. What's worse, perovskite quantum dot materials will agglomerate during the dissolution–recrystallization cycles in the environment, which will lead to the transformation from the α phase into the δ phase and deterioration of their stability.
Committed to solving these problems, Sanehira and coworkers demonstrated for the first time a post-treatment technology based on A-site cation halide salts (AX, where A = FA+, MA+, Cs+; X = I− or Br−), as shown in Fig. 8d. After FAI post-treatment, the C–H modes associated with the as-synthesized oleate and oleylammonium ligands near 3000 cm−1 in the FTIR decreased, which suggested that additional native ligands were removed. Removal of native ligands can reduce inter-particle spacing, increase the overlap of wave functions between adjacent quantum dots and improve the electronic coupling between single quantum dots, thereby enhancing the mobility of carriers and improving the JSC of the device. Finally, the CsPbI3 quantum dot PSC achieved a PCE of 13.43%.
In order to improve the carrier extraction efficiency and agglomeration problems of quantum dot PSCs, Wang and coworkers proposed another method that involves using μ-graphene (μ-GR) cross-linked quantum dots to form a μGR/CsPbI3 film, as shown in Fig. 8e. The μ-graphene was like a gasket between the quantum dots, which can provide efficient carrier transport channels for the quantum dots, thereby increasing the photocurrent density of the device. In addition, the “gasket” also played a role in isolating water vapor and temperature, which greatly improved the performance of the device. Compared with solar cells without μ-GR treatment, the efficiency increased from 10.41% to 11.40%, with an increase of 12%. More importantly, μ-GR crosslinking also greatly suppressed the agglomeration of quantum dots caused by heat/humidity. After being stored in an N2 atmosphere for one month, the optimized device retained above 98% of the initial efficiency.
Soon after, Ling and coworkers proposed a method for surface passivation of CsPbI3 QDs using inorganic cesium salt, as shown in Fig. 8f. This method can not only fill the vacancies on the surface of the CsPbI3 perovskite, but also improve the electronic coupling between CsPbI3 quantum dots. For that reason, the carrier lifetime and mobility of quantum dot films were improved and trap-assisted non-radiative recombination could also be suppressed. The optimized device efficiency reached 14.1%.
In addition to surface passivation, ion doping is also a very effective strategy. Shi and coworkers successfully synthesized Yb3+ doped CsPbI3 QDs. The doping with Yb3+ could make quantum dots passivate in situ and effectively reduce the trap states caused by surface vacancies and lattice vacancies, thereby reducing carrier recombination and improving carrier transport. Photovoltaic devices prepared based on Yb3+ doped CsPbI3 quantum dots exhibited an efficiency of 13.12%. Bi and coworkers prepared CsPb0.93Zn0.07I3 colloidal quantum dots by adding ZnCl2 to CsPbI3 precursor solution. The synchrotron-based extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements showed that the CsPb0.93Zn0.07I3 quantum dots had higher symmetry and stronger peak intensity than the original sample, indicating that the introduction of Zn2+ improved the local order of the crystal lattice and lattice formation energy and reduced the octahedral distortion, as shown in Fig. 8g. Furthermore, the Cl− of ZnCl2 occupied the iodine vacancies in the perovskite, which reduced the non-radiative recombination of carriers and further improved the performance of the photovoltaic device. PSCs based on CsPb0.93Zn0.07I3 quantum dots exhibited an efficiency of 14.8%, and the unencapsulated device could maintain an initial efficiency of more than 95% after exposure to ambient conditions (RH: 20–30%, temperature: ∼25 °C) for 50 h. Inspired by this, Zhang and coworkers used ZnI2 as a dopant to synthesize iodine-rich Zn-doped CsPbI3 quantum dots, which further increased the efficiency of the device to 16.07%.
In addition to Cl−, Br− is also used to improve the photoelectric properties of CsPbI3 QDs. Recently, Liu and coworkers successfully synthesized CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 QDs with different Br doping amounts using thermal injection. When the Br amount increased from 0% to 30%, the bandgap of CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 QDs increased from 1.77 eV to 1.89 eV, and the VOC value of CsPb(I1−xBrx)3QD PSCs increased from 1.13 V to 1.24 V. However, the JSC value and PCE value decreased from 10.80 mA cm−2 to 17.69 mA cm−2 and from 14.13% to 9.86%, respectively. This experiment provided a reference for the following study of Br-doping problems. Yuan and coworkers used CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots and the Y6 series of non-fullerene molecules to synthesize high-efficiency quantum dot/organic hybrid films. The non-fullerene electron acceptor (NFA) mainly formed a new chemical bond with the uncoordinated Pb2+ on the surface of the quantum dot to passivate surface defects. As shown in Fig. 8i, the CsPbI3 QD/Y6 series NFA can form the second type of energy level arrangement, which can realize the effective charge transfer and extraction of the quantum dot/organic heterogeneous interface and finally obtain the best PCE of 15.05%.
Purification based on polar anti-solvent will cause the dissolution and agglomeration of perovskite quantum dots, resulting in irregular size distribution and increasing their polydispersity. The increase in polydispersity of colloidal quantum dots resulted in increased energy disorder and band-tail broadening, resulting in reduced photovoltaic performance. So as to solve this problem, Lim and coworkers used gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to prepare monodisperse perovskite quantum dot solar cells, as shown in Fig. 8i. The disorder of energy can be reduced to below the optimal bandgap through band-tail sharpening, thus not only minimizing energy loss but also improving the light absorption. Compared with control devices, the monodisperse quantum dot solar cells obtained a pleasing efficiency of 15.3% and a VOC of 1.27 V.

In recent years, all-inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs have attracted great attention due to their excellent thermal stability and potential application in practical systems. This review summarizes the research progress in CsPbI3 PSCs from 2015 to the present in terms of film deposition techniques, additive and interface engineering, doping engineering and quantum dot technology. The structures and performance parameters of I-PSCs are shown in Tables 1–6. As seen, although CsPbI3 PSCs have experienced rapid development in the past five years, there is still a big gap between them and organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs. Thus, the main research direction in the future may still be how to achieve higher PCEs and improved stability for the black phase of CsPbI3.

Based on the above progress, the following perspectives are discussed to further improve the performance of all-inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs:
The energy loss caused by energy level mismatch has always been the main factor affecting the efficiency of CsPbI3 PSCs. The energy level barriers between the various layers in the solar cell will hinder the transport of carriers, thereby reducing JSC. Selecting more matched energy level carrier transport layers is a wise choice for efficient charge transportation. Although a large number of ETLs, such as C60, PCBM and TiO2, and HTLs, such as PTAA, NiOx, and spiro-OMeTAD, have been used in organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs, they are usually not perfectly suitable for all-inorganic PSCs because of their unmatched energy levels. In addition, the most commonly used hole transport materials (HTMs) are organic materials such as spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA and PEDOT:PSS. They still have the risk of being unstable in the environment, which will seriously affect the long-term stability of the device and hinder the progress of their commercialization. Alternatively, inorganic HTMs, such as Cu12Sb4S13 QDs, MoOx, CuSCN, CuI and NiOx, have been developed. For example, the device with an FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbI3-BP1−2/CuSCN/Au structure exhibited the highest PCE (14.17%), but it is still far below the 20.37% of spiro-OMeTAD-based I-PSCs. The most commonly used inorganic electron transport material (ETM) is TiO2. However, the potential barrier formed by the interface defects or differences in energy-level alignment between the perovskite and TiO2 ETL and the low electron migration rate of TiO2 often hinder the effective transportation of electrons from the perovskite layer to ETL, further affecting the performance of PSCs. Therefore, the development of more efficient and stable inorganic HTMs and ETMs is extremely important to further improve the performance of I-PSCs. Besides, seeking electron and hole transport layers with matched energy levels and adding an additional interface modification layer at the perovskite layer/charge transport interfaces are important ways to improve the carrier transport.
Although the stability of I-PSCs has been significantly improved in a certain way, achieving robust stability in a multi-stress environment is still a big challenge. To meet the requirements of practical application, for example, some devices pass the double 85 condition, high and low temperature cycle and other aging tests, but their light stability is not good; some devices’ room temperature light stability is very good, but the light and heat co-aging stability is not ideal. Light-induced degradation and light–thermal induced degradation are not explicitly reflected in the aging stability test (IEC61215) of silicon solar cells. According to IEC61215, the light aging standard is exposure with a light flux of 60 kW h m−2, which is only equivalent to continuous 1 sun illumination for 60 hours. This light aging test is clearly not enough to assess the life of PSCs. The reason for the above problems is that the crystallization and doping of silicon achieve thermal balance at high temperature, and its own light and thermal sensitivity are not high. While the conventional crystallization temperature of perovskites is only 100–150 °C, the bond energy is relatively weak, and the activation energy of ion migration is low, which lead to the perovskite itself being very sensitive to light and heat. For such solar cells based on light and thermally sensitive materials, sufficient light flux must be applied for light aging experiments, supplemented with a certain high temperature (75–85 °C), to confirm their true light–thermal tolerance. Dye-sensitized solar cells have been reported with lots of light aging experimental data for more than 5000 hours, while ultra-long time light aging data for PSCs are still very limited. Therefore, the unremitting efforts of researchers are also needed in this regard.
The upscaling of small-size PSCs into module scale devices is the prerequisite condition for their industrialization application. The deposition of high-quality inorganic perovskite films over large area is particularly important to achieve efficient perovskite solar modules. Currently, the preparation of large-area perovskite films by scalable coating and other methods still has big challenges. The uncontrollable crystallization of perovskites usually leads to current leakage and open-circuit voltage loss and other consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the crystallization kinetics of inorganic perovskite films in the upscaling fabrication process, so as to optimize the composition of perovskite precursor solution and develop suitable processes for large area manufacturing technology, such as blade coating and slot-die coating, for I-PSCs. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the various strategies summarized above – additive engineering, dimensionality engineering, doping engineering and quantum dot engineering – are mostly limited to small-area devices (0.09 cm2) prepared in inert atmospheres by the spin coating method, and it is difficult to apply them to large-area modules due to the too fast crystallization of the inorganic perovskite film. Besides, the spin coating method showed a high precursor solution waste ratio of over 90%, which may negate the low-cost advantage of PSCs. Therefore, finding suitable promotion strategies for large-area modules is another top priority for future development.
