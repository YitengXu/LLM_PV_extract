The advance in lifestyle, modern industrialization and future technological revolution are always at high expense of energy consumption. Unfortunately, there exist serious issues such as limited storage, high cost and toxic contamination in conventional fossil fuel energy sources. Instead, solar energy represents a renewable, economic and green alternative in the future energy market. Among the photovoltaic technologies, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) demonstrate a cheap, flexible, clean and easy-processing way to convert solar energy into electricity. However, OPVs with a conventional device structure are still far away from industrialization mainly because of their short lifetime and the energy-intensive deposition of top metal electrode. To address the stability and cost issue simultaneously, an inverted device structure has been introduced into OPVs, bridging laboratory research with practical application. In this review, recent progress in device structures, working mechanisms, functions and advances of each component layer as well their correlations with the efficiency and stability of inverted OPVs are reviewed and illustrated.

Driven by economic acceleration, demographic explosion and technical evolution, the available energy supplies have been placed on a huge strain. Modern lifestyles, industrialization and future technological revolution require at least a 56% increase in the world energy consumption in the next 30 years. However, the currently predominantly used fossil fuel energy are in limited reserves, are high cost and have poor environmental impact. In addition, the environmental pollution and climate issues raised from the combustion of fossil, will inevitably cause irreversible damage to biological diversity, climate and world economies. Therefore, to find novel renewable, cheap and clean energy sources is one of the most comprehensive insurances for long-term development of future quality of life.


Solar energy shows great potential in the future energy market due to its essentially unlimited supply and renewable, cheap and clean nature. The solar power received upon the earth is approximately 6.12 × 1020 J h−1, which could cover the world's total energy consumption in a whole year (∼5.6 × 1020 J in the year of 2010). Solar cells with an efficiency of 10% covering 0.16% of land area would produce 20 Terawatts energy with extremely low economic and environmental cost, which is approximately twice of the energy produced by fossil fuel and numerous times that from nuclear fission reactors. However, the application of solar energy today is still not widespread, mainly due to the compromise between the costs and the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The commercially available silicon-based photovoltaic cells (85% market share) are relatively expensive because of their critical manufacture processing. Alternatively, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have shown their outstanding potentials in the cost-effective manufacturing thanks to their unique properties such as wide material availability, low-temperature solution-processability, and roll-to-roll manufacturing processability. However, there still exist critical requirements for the commercialization of OPVs. Scheme 1 demonstrates a critical pentagram summarizing the requirements in five technology driving aspects that the OPVs need to reach. In addition to the conventional three primary factors, “efficiency”, “lifetime” and “cost” (per watt-peak), new requirements such as “clean” and “prospect” have been also added. The “clean” is defined to be the environmental impact of the OPVs and the “prospect” is how far the OPVs will go in the market. Successful commercialization can be achieved only if all the technology driving aspects are fulfilled at the same time.


A single-junction OPVs is a sandwich structure, where a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composite is sandwiched between the low work-function (WF) metal cathode (aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca) or barium (Ba)) and the high WF transparent conducting metal oxide anode, e.g., indium-tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO). The device architecture of a conventional device structure is shown in Scheme 2a. Typically, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as an anode buffer layer is used to smooth the surface of the ITO electrode or the FTO electrode. However, the ITO can be etched over time upon direct exposure to the acidic PEDOT:PSS buffer layer, especially at elevated temperature and humidity. Moreover, the cast PEDOT:PSS layer always exhibits large microstructural and electrical inhomogeneity including order-of-magnitude variations in film morphological and electrical conductive gradients from near the surface region to bulk, which inevitably deteriorates charge transport and results in inferior device performance. Furthermore, the high-cost vacuum evaporation for the top metal electrode makes the fabrication incompatible with a large-scale roll-to-roll process. Micropores can be formed within the top metal electrode during the vacuum evaporation process, allowing both oxygen and moisture to be diffused into the polymer layer, degrading the underlying polymers. As a result, poor device efficiency and low device stability are currently a feature of conventional structured OPVs.


In order to circumvent the above problems, the inverted device structure, as shown in Scheme 2b, has been developed. The ITO or the FTO acts as the cathode and the high WF metals act as the anode, respectively. Also, the polarity of charge collection is reversed in inverted OPVs, which allows the utilization of more ambient stable and high WF metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) as the top anode, making it possible for printing technologies to deposit the metal anode instead of the conventional energy consuming thermal deposition technologies. Meanwhile the acidic PEDOT:PSS buffer layer is also eliminated to avoid the proton etching ITO or the cation derogating the organics. At this point of view, inverted OPVs possess huge commercialization potential in comparison to conventional OPVs.


The device structures of conventional and inverted OPVs are shown in Scheme 2a and b, both of which are illuminated from the transparent substrate at the bottom because light cannot pass through the opaque metal electrode on the top. In comparison, a top-illuminated device structure, as shown in Scheme 2c, has also been developed by applying either ultra-thin metal films (e.g., ultra-thin Au), or structured materials (e.g., metal/metal grid, metal nano-wires, metal foil substrates or plastic foils with translucent metal coatings), or novel highly conductive materials (e.g., highly conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene) as the transparent top electrode to avoid utilization of traditional expensive electrode materials. Moreover, solution-processable top electrodes would allow OPVs being fabricated on either rigid or flexible subtracts by printing technologies.

The top-illuminated device structure was first introduced by Glatthaar et al. by constructing OPVs with a device structure of glass/Al (80 nm)/titanium (Ti) (20 nm)/photo active layer (150 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (250 nm)/Au-grid (50 nm), where the top electrode (a combination of highly transparent and conductive PEDOT:PSS with thin Au-grid) allowed sufficient photons passing through and reaching the active layer. Moreover, an ohmic contact was formed between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of p-type materials and the WF of the top electrode, so that the holes can be effectively extracted to the electrodes. A thin titanium layer was inserted to prevent the formation of the highly insulating Al2O3 at the surface of Al. A PCE of 1.4% under AM 1.5 solar illumination was achieved by using such a semi-transparent top electrode configuration with a BHJ composite of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) blended with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) in 2005. In 2007, Takahito et al. demonstrated a similar bi-layer OPVs using the concept of “top light-harvesting” based on the structure of Si/SiO2 layer/cathode/organic layer/semitransparent metal anode. A PCE of 1.05% was achieved, which was comparable to that of the conventional OPVs at that time. In addition, such top-illuminated inverted OPVs was further rejuvenated to a superior mechanically flexible device with a higher PCE of ∼3%, which was reported by Chen et al. in 2009. By applying a device structure of stainless-steel foil/photoresist/SiOx/Ag/ITO/Cs2CO3/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Al counter electrode grid (10%)/ITO, flexible OPVs with excellent mechanical flexibility and high air stability was reported. Moreover, device engineering for highly efficient top-illuminated OPVs has been further developed recently. Particularly, an optical microresonant cavity system consisting of a photoactive layer sandwiched between two metallic electrodes has received attention not only due to its low photon loss rate, but also its functions of confining and storing optical energy in small volumes allowing more photons being captured. By coating a functional layer on the Ag electrode, both the electrode transmittance and the electric field intensity in the photoactive layers can be enhanced, which is attributed to an induced microresonant cavity arising from fine-tuning-thickness of the capping layer. As a result, a PCE of 4.5% was achieved by Jung's group using a device architecture of PET/Al/PCDTBT:PC61BM/MoOx–Ag–MoOx (nanopatterned 3D microresonant cavity layer), where PET is polyethylene terephthalate, PCPDTBT is poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl], respectively. The idea of confining photons by microcavity structures was also reported by Lin et al. They applied such structures into top-illuminated small-molecule OPVs and obtained over 5% PCEs. Jen's group further pushed the PCEs to 9.4% on flexible substrates by integrating the plasmonic effect into the ITO-free microcavity architecture. Due to the synergetic resonant coherence, a broadband and high absorption response of the photoactive layer could be accomplished, which contributed to a substantially increased photocurrent. By tailoring the absorption response, tandem OPVs with solution-processed silver paste as the reflective bottom electrode and silver nanowires as the transparent top electrode was reported by Brabec's group. Although the PCE of 5.81% (on the glass substrate) and 4.85% (on the flexible substrate) were not sufficiently high, the possibility of printing efficient tandem OPVs under ambient conditions was well demonstrated. Furthermore, other ITO-free OPVs have also been developed. For example, top-illuminated inverted organic photosensors with single layer graphene electrodes were demonstrated by Chabinyc's group. Ag nanomesh transparent conducting electrode was demonstrated by Kim and Choi et al. Highly electrical conductive polymer as the anode was demonstrated by Kim's group. Detailed explanations on materials and mechanisms of the top electrodes will be discussed in Section 6.
The innovation of a functional transparent electrode, particularly the methodology of layered light-trapping or microresonant cavity, would boost the PCEs. Further, the top-illuminated OPVs, (semi-)transparent OPVs and all-solution-processed OPVs would further push forward the commercial application prospects of inverted OPVs.

Although the polarity of charge collection is completely opposite in inverted OPVs compared to their conventional counterparts (as shown in Scheme 2a and b, respectively), the photovoltaic processes are almost the same for both. The photons are first absorbed by the active layer and the electrons from the HOMO level of the active layer (e.g., P3HT and PC61BM) can be excited to the corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, forming the excitons there (the majority of excitons are formed in the electron-donor materials, e.g., P3HT; and the minority excitons can also be formed in the electron-acceptor materials, e.g., PC61BM). The difference of chemical potentials at the interface of the electron donor (P3HT) and the electron acceptor (PC61BM) can act as an additional “field” to separate the excitons, where a charge-transfer state model is extensively employed to understand the processes in many reports. The separated charge carriers can be selectively transported to the corresponding electrodes due to the different energy levels of the charge extraction layer (CEL) between the active layer and the electrodes, for example, MoOx and ZnO as shown in Scheme 2b. Therefore, both CEL and the electrodes function as the “selector” that can select a certain kind of charge carriers (holes or electrons) to be collected and thus the polarity of charge collection in the device is tuned. Apart from charge selection, the interfacial layers should possess the following functions as well: photon transmission (allow photons to pass though and reach the active layer), efficient charge transport (allow charge carriers to be transported from the active layer to the corresponding electrode with less charge loss), energy level offset (reduce charge carrier extraction barrier to increase photocurrent extraction from the active layer), and surface modification (modify the surface of the electrodes or the active layer). By inserting such functional interfacial layers between active layer and the electrodes, the PCEs of OPVs can be increased in various scales. In addition, the material stability should also be considered to maintain the lifetime of OPVs.


The electron extraction layer (EEL) was first introduced in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) to balance the charge carrier injection. By applying such a layer into organic thin film transistors and OPVs, device performances were dramatically improved as well. In general, the function of the EEL can be classified as suppressing surface states of the active layer, protecting the active layer from being damaged by the metallic cathode, and changing the energy level alignment by forming dipole moments at the active layer/cathode interface. Transition metal oxides (TMOs), alkali-metal compounds and ultrathin layers are the major three types of EELs and will be demonstrated below.


The most representative TMOs EEL is ZnO, which possesses several favorable physical properties including good transparency, high electron mobility, non-toxicity and low production cost. ZnO is a n-type metal oxide with a LUMO and a HOMO energy level around −4.3 eV and −7.6 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy level of the commonly used electron acceptors (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM) is about −4.3 eV, and the HOMO energy level of the electron donors is around −5.0 eV, indicating that ZnO is a good EEL and hole blocking layer in BHJ OPVs.

In 2004, Shirakawa and Yoshino et al. reported a sputter-deposited ZnO thin film (50–100 nm) as the EEL in the bi-layer structured OPVs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/C60/P3HT/Au. A monochromic external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 70% at the peak wavelength and a PCE of 1.0% were obtained. Later on, White et al. demonstrated a solution-processed ZnO thin film via using a precursor solution of zinc acetate in 2-methoxyethanol and ethanolamine. The OPVs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC61BM/Ag showed a comparable PCE with an enhanced short-circuit current (JSC), which was attributed to the effective hole blocking effect from the inherently n-type characteristics of the solution-processed ZnO EEL. Kelvin probe measurements demonstrated that the WF of sol–gel processed ZnO layer is −4.3 eV, which is close to its conduction band (−4.1 eV). Four-probe Hall effect technique illustrated the low carrier concentration of 1016–1017 cm−3, and high electron mobility of solution-processed ZnO thin film. Nevertheless, small grains in ZnO thin film, as visualized in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, probably decreased the charge carrier mobility and deteriorated the charge transport. Taking these issues into account, our group improved the sol–gel method by using optimized precursor solution and an ameliorated thermal annealing process to make higher quality ZnO EEL. Morphological characterizations by AFM and scanning electron microscope (SEM) demonstrated that the ZnO thin film was quite uniform with nanoscale fibrils of ∼10 nm diameters. The ripple pattern on the ZnO surface was further proved to give light absorption enhancement by a light scattering effect. Moreover, the electron mobility of ZnO was measured to be 4.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was comparable to the electron mobility from most organic materials used as the EEL in organic electronics. By employing such high quality ZnO as the EEL in inverted OPVs, high PCE of 3.8% was observed with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/PSiF-DBT:PC61BM/MoOx/Au, which is more than twice as large as that of OPVs without ZnO layer, where PSiF-DBT is poly[(2,7-dioctylsilafluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-(benzothiadiazole)-5,50-diyl]). Moreover, other methods such as manipulating the concentration of solution, fine-tuning the solvent and changing the processing conditions (e.g. temperature or spin-casting kinetic parameters) have also been developed to achieve a conformal and pinhole-free film.Table 1 compares the device performances of OPVs with similar architecture of ITO (or FTO)/ZnO/organic active layer/HEL/metal cathode, where the ZnO EEL was processed by different processing methods. Specifically, O'Brien et al. used single step sol–gel thin film deposition, as shown in Scheme 3a, by changing the precursor concentrations, ZnO thickness could be tuned from 80 to 350 nm with highest optical transmittance over 90% at wavelength ranging from 400 to 800 nm. Kyaw et al. modified the sol–gel methods by changing solvents, precursor concentrations and processing temperatures, as shown in Scheme 3b, to get higher quality ZnO thin films. It was found that lower concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 M with optimized solvent and temperature would result in a higher quality ZnO thin film with smaller grain sizes and more uniform film morphology. By employing such ZnO thin film in OPVs with a device structure of FTO/ZnO/P3HT:PC61BM/Au, a PCE of 2.01% was obtained from the OPVs with 120 nm thickness of the ZnO EEL. In addition, by changing the precursor concentration to tune the transparency of ZnO thin film, Kyaw et al. obtained a high transparency of 95% in the visible region and thereby a 43% enhancement in JSC. Hau et al. further boosted the PCE to 3.78% and developed OPVs on the flexible plastic substrate by adopting the low-temperature solution-processed ZnO EEL. A revolutionary application of solution-processed ZnO in roll-to-roll manufacture of inverted OPVs was reported by Krebs et al. A PCE of 2.67% was achieved from OPVs with a device area of 1 cm2. Very recently, Pradhan et al. reported efficient inverted OPVs by using low-temperature (∼100 °C) solution-processed diethylzinc precursor solution to form ZnO EEL. The enhanced transparency and elevated electrical properties resulted in a highest PCE of 4.03% from P3HT:PC61BM based OPVs. In spite of different precursor concentrations, or temperatures or solvents, the overall sol–gel methods for preparing the ZnO EEL were almost identical, which can be classified into the typical process flow for the preparation of thin metal-oxide layers from solution, as shown in Scheme 3c.

On the other hand, conformal and pinhole-free films can also be achieved via using atomic layer deposition (ALD) by controllably introducing reactant gas into the reaction zone at low temperatures. In addition, the large-scale mass-production and low-temperature (<100 °C) processability of ALD makes it more preferable for industrialization. The device performance of OPVs using ALD processed ZnO EEL and the corresponding device structures are summarized in Table 1. Wang et al. reported an ALD prepared ZnO EEL in OPVs and observed a PCE of 4.18% from P3HT:PC61BM based OPVs. The high PCE resulted from the enhanced hole blocking effect and enhanced electron collecting efficiency due to the fine-controlled high quality ZnO EEL. Cheun et al. found that the WF, surface roughness, and thin film morphology of ZnO EEL were independent on the thickness of the ZnO EEL, but the device performance was strongly dependent on the thickness of ZnO EEL. Thinner ZnO EEL would lead to a dramatically decreased electrical conductivity because of the oxygen trap effect. A higher PCE of 4.1% was realized by using a 60 nm ALD ZnO film deposited at 90 °C. It was also found that low carrier concentration (2.1 × 1017 cm−3) and high electron mobility (9.6 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the ALD film led to a high JSC and FF. Hoye et al. reported an atmospheric ALD processed ZnO EEL, with an extremely high transparency (∼100%) in the visible region. The processing procedure is shown in simplified form in Scheme 3d. Using similar strategies, increasing numbers of studies focusing on ALD ZnO EEL have been reported recently. Jin et al. tuned the structural and optical properties of ZnO EEL by sequentially injecting ZnO precursor solution and using O2 plasma treatment during the ALD process. By changing the processing conditions, tunable nanocrystals of ZnO were realized, rendering a high PCE for the final device. Eita et al. applied ALD to fabricate the layer-by-layer structured multilayers of polyacrylic acid and ZnO nanoparticles as the EEL in OPVs. Lu et al. applied Au/LiF-modified ZnO interlayer to enhance the charge collection efficiency and obtained a 40% enhancement in PCE. It was found that the major enhancement was originated from JSC, which was due to the enhanced electrical transport properties of modified ZnO EEL. A similar study was also conducted in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), where Li+ being inserted into ZnO nanocrystalline particles were used as the EEL. The incorporation of Li+ was found to improve the charge transport and suppress the recombination and consequently to enhance JSC dramatically. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) can be enlarged by modifying the energy state of ZnO layer. Gao and Liu et al. obtained a VOC of 0.67 V from P3HT:PC61BM system by applying H-plasma treatment to tune the WF of ZnO.

Similar to ZnO, TiO2 is another TMO as an efficient EEL. TiO2 possesses the features of good transparency, high electron mobility, non-toxicity and low-production cost. Due to the well matched conduction band (−4.4 eV) with the LUMO energy level of PC61BM (−4.3 eV) and the low-lying valence band (−7.5 eV) for effectively blocking the holes, TiO2 stands out as a promising EEL in inverted OPVs. The investigation on fundamental physics of TiO2, the application of TiO2 in photocatalysis and in DSSCs have been well reviewed previously. Here, a brief introduction will be given on the processing methods and the corresponding device performance of inverted OPVs using the TiO2 EEL.

Various methods have been reported to prepare TiO2 thin films. These include micelle and inverse micelle methods, sol–gel method, solvothermal method, hydrothermal method, direct oxidation method, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, electrodeposition, sonochemical method, and microwave method. Among them, the sol–gel method using hydrolysis of a titanium precursor was most widely used for preparation of TiO2 in OPVs. The general preparing procedures outlined by Pasquarelli et al., was similar to those used for preparation of other TMOs as schematically described in Scheme 3d. By changing the processing conditions such as deposition methods and precursor solvents to tune the TiO2 crystal forming environment, TiO2 with various crystal types and film morphologies can be achieved. Scheme 4a and b display different deposition methods and the reaction schemes for the formation of phase-pure TiO2.
The early application of TiO2 in DSSCs was reported by Grätzel's group in the 1990s. The titanium isopropoxide precursor was treated at a high temperature of 450 °C to give a very thick film, which impede its application in thin-film OPVs. Instead, Heeger's group introduced a low-temperature sol–gel process based on a precursor solution of titanium isopropoxide mixed with 2-methoxyethanol and ethanolamine. High transparency (Eg ∼ −3.7 eV) with low surface roughness was obtained. Table 2 summarizes the device performance of OPVs using TiO2 or TiOx EEL. Specifically, Kim et al. reported a gel-deposited ultrathin TiOx layer (30 nm) in the conventional OPVs, which induced a 50% enhancement in JSC. The spatial redistribution of the light intensity led to an increased photogeneration of charge carriers and a 100% internal quantum efficiency was thereby realized. Bao et al. applied tetrabutyl titanate as the Ti precursor to obtain TiOx EEL by the traditional sol–gel method, and a highest PCE of 4.65% was observed from P3HT:PC61BM system. The low temperature (90 °C) processed TiOx shows a good electrical conductivity of 7.4 × 10−6 S cm−1. Apart from tuning temperature in the thermal treatment, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is another way to optimize the TiOx layer by reducing the electron traps in the titanium oxide.

In addition to planar TMOs layer, nanostructured TMOs have also been introduced in OPVs. By using certain nanostructures such as well-ordered, mesoporous and nano-wire TiOx and ZnO, the interfacial area between the TMOs layer and active layer can be further enlarged. Such OPVs was also referred as “double-heterojunction” devices (here the “double-heterojunction” was different from that in the tandem OPVs), where one heterojunction was the disordered BHJ at the electron donor/electron acceptor (D/A) interface and the other one was an ordered heterojunction at the electron donor/n-type metal oxide (D/EEL) interface, as shown in Scheme 5a. The enlarged D/A interfaces in the BHJ composite can offer an additional “field” to separate the excitons. The enlarged D/EEL interface from the ordered heterojunction can also offer an additional “field” to separate the photo-generated excitons due to the difference in chemical potentials between D and EEL (n-type materials). On the other hand, an ordered heterojunction at the A/HEL interface can also be realized by using nano-structured HEL materials knowing that excitons can also be formed in A. In this way, enhanced charge extraction efficiency can be realized and more charge carriers are expected to be extracted, transported and collected. Since TiOx can be patterned into a continuous network for electron transport, the excitons can be dissociated effectively at the interface between TiOx and polymer if polymer and TiOx can be structured in an ordered style with a pore size of 20–30 nm, which is comparable to the exciton diffusion length. Scheme 5b shows a TiOx nanotube infilled by P3HT:PC61BM BHJ composite. The vertical channel confinement can also improve the charge transfer property. It was reported that the charge carrier mobility of polymer was enhanced about 20-fold due to the vertical “channel confinement effect” in the pores of TiOx nanotube along the direction perpendicular to the substrates. As a result, the concept of “double-heterojunction”, including the disordered BHJ at D/A interfaces and ordered heterojunction at D/EEL interfaces, would not only facilitate the exciton dissociation due to the enlarged large-surface area, but also optimize the ordered network morphology and improve charge transport properties. This idea can be revealed by filling the BHJ composite into the pores of sintered TiOx nanocrystals. Mor et al., realized the “double-BHJ” via utilizing vertically oriented TiOx nanotube arrays as the EEL, and infiltrating with P3HT:PC61BM (Scheme 5b). The length of TiOx nanotubes was 270 nm and the size of pores was chosen to be 50 nm, which was large enough to infiltrate the nanotubes from the subsequent polymeric layer, allowing the polymer chains to coil, aggregate and have a more film-like environment. The well patterned P3HT originated from the TiOx nanotube was demonstrated to have a coiled chains pattern with a shorter conjugation length. Thus, the vertically oriented TiOx nanotube led to enhanced charge-carrier mobility due to the ordered nano-structure. Combined with the additional excitons dissociation sites at the TiOx/P3HT interfaces, an enlarged JSC of 12.4 mA cm−2, elevated EQE (maximum 80% at 538 nm) and enhanced PCE of 4.1% were observed from P3HT:PC61BM system. Yu et al. reported a similar work from OPVs with a device structure of ITO/TiOx/P3HT:PC61BM/V2O5/Al. The self-organized TiOx nanotubes arrays were grown by anodizing Ti metal in glycerol electrolyte containing 0.5 wt% NH4F and 1.0 wt% H2O with 20 V potential, after annealing at 500 °C for 1 h, the TiOx film with an anatase phase and a diameter of 15–25 nm was formed. The enhanced electrical conductivity of TiOx thin film gave rise to an enlarged JSC due to reduced charge carrier loss during the transport process.

As shown in Scheme 5d, a nanofiber structured ZnO film has also been studied. Olson et al. fabricated vertically aligned ZnO nanofibers, and filled the ZnO nanopores with polymer and the polymer:fullerene composite. The hybrid solar cells with BHJ composite of ZnO nanofibers:P3HT exhibited a VOC of 0.44 V, a JSC of 2.2 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.56, and a PCE of 0.53%. In contrast, the double heterojunction OPVs based on P3HT:PC61BM system using ZnO nanofibers exhibited a VOC of 0.44 V, a JSC of 10.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.43, and a PCE of 2.03%. The dramatically increased JSC confirmed the function of the double heterojunction. Although the hypothesis of mid-gap states and cascading electron transfer from PC61BM to the ZnO nanorods have been provided, the reason for the erratically small VOC and the mechanism for the electron transport need to be further addressed. In this point of view, Takanezawa et al. studied P3HT:PC61BM/ZnO nanorod OPVs with a thicker hybrid layer of 450 nm. By increasing the length of the ZnO nanorods, the FF was increased from 38 to 50%, which was due to the enhanced electron collecting and transporting property of ZnO nanorod arrayed in P3HT:PC61BM/ZnO nanorod system. Moreover, the presence of the highly electrical conductive ZnO nanorod (high electron mobility of ∼1–5 cm2 s−1 V−1) shortened the average distance from the generation point of the charge carriers to the ZnO surface.
Apart from “double heterojunction” structures, TMOs/TMOs and TMOs/organic nano-composites have also been used as the efficient EEL. Liu et al. applied a TiOx modified ZnO nanocrystal layer as the EEL in inverted OPVs. The improved contact with the metals electrode effectively reduced the interfacial charge recombination loss, resulting in a PCE of 6.53% from the PCDTBT:PC61BM BHJ system. Furthermore, Liu sensitized the ZnO nanocrystals with a blue fluorescent conjugated polymer, poly(9,9-bis-(6′-diethoxylphosphorylhexyl)fluorene) to obtain a more uniformly dispersive and high electrical conductive EEL. A PCE of 7.56% was achieved for P(IID-DTC):PC61BM BHJ system, where P(IID-DTC) is poly[N-dedocyldithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole-alt-N,N′-di(2-octyldodecanyl)isoindigo]. Hu and Chen et al. reported a ZnO/graphene oxide composite modified by amphiphilic fullerene-end-capped poly(ethylene glycol) as the EEL to reduce charge carrier recombination and to enhance the electron extraction efficiency. A PCE of 8.1% was realized by using the polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):PC71BM system. Other studies on TMOs/self-assemble monolayer and TMOs/polyelectrolyte will be overviewed in Section 4.

Similar to the functions in OLEDs, insulating alkali-metal compounds such as LiF, CsF, Li2O and Na2O were also utilized to establish the desired interfacial chemistry and desired trapped interface charge density for balancing the injection between the electrons and holes. Among them, LiF was the most commonly used EEL modification layer in OPVs. Alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals incorporated with organic molecules and alkali metal (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+) acetates and fluorides were also reported as the EEL in both OLEDs and OPVs.

The representative alkali-metal compound Cs2CO3 as an interfacial layer was first reported by Canon Inc. In 2006, Li et al. reported its applications in OPVs with a device structure of ITO/Cs2CO3 (1 nm)/P3HT:PC61BM/V2O5/metal. A PCE of 2.25% was demonstrated with a JSC of 8.42 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.56 V. The relatively low PCE was mainly due to the thin active layer. Still in Yang's group, low-temperature annealed Cs2CO3 interfacial buffer layer was reported in 2008, an improved PCE with JSC of 11.17 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.59 V, and FF of 63% was observed from inverted OPVs. In general the decomposition temperature of Cs2CO3 is 550–600 °C, while during low-temperature annealing, the Cs2CO3 may decompose into cesium oxide, indicating the formation of a n-type doped Cs2CO3 thin film after the annealing process. The surface energy of the Cs2CO3 thin film was also demonstrated to be changed by thermal annealing, with surface property shifting from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, and consequently favoring the polymer film growth. Barbot also reported a C60 doped Cs2CO3 thin film as the EEL, reaching a PCE of 3.79%, with 26% improvement compared to the control devices. Very recently, thermal-annealing-free inverted OPVs using ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)/Cs2CO3 bilayer as the electron-selective layer was reported by Cheng et al.
Apart from Cs2CO3, a number of other salts, including alkali-metal carbonates such as Li2CO3, and cesium-containing salts such as CsF, cesium acetylacetonate, were also utilized as the EEL in OPVs. The processes are as following: the salts were first dissolved in water or polar organic solvent such as 2-ethoxyethanol to form dilute (0.2 wt%) solutions, followed by a spin-coating process to form a 0.6–3 nm thick film. The function of the thin layer was to lower the WF of the ITO or FTO electrode. With the addition of only a few monolayers of molecules, it was believed that strong dipole layer was formed at the interface. As shown in Scheme 6, a thin layer of oxygen–metal species was formed at the surface of ITO or FTO electrode. The dipole here pointing from the ITO electrode to the vacuum level reduced the ITO surface WF. Moreover, the interfacial charge transfer rate at the cathode was enhanced, leading to a decreased series resistance. As a result, both JSC and VOC were increased.

In the conventional OPVs, the charge collection and the built-in potential can be increased by introducing a thin layer of low WF metal (Ca and Mg). The low WF metals can serve as an interfacial layer to collect the electrons efficiently when they are sandwiched between the ITO electrode and the active layer in inverted OPVs. Zhao et al. reported an inverted OPVs using an ultrathin Ca layer (1 nm) as the EEL. With an optimal MoOx (3 nm) as the anode buffer layer, inverted OPVs using P3HT:PC61BM possessed a PCE of 3.55%. The WF of Ca is −2.9 eV, which modified the WF of ITO through the Fermi level pinning between Ca and PC61BM, thereby increasing the VOC of OPVs.


Similar to the alkali-metal compounds, the mechanism for using conjugated polymers as the interfacial layer was originated from the formation of an interface dipole layer that leads to a substantial reduction of the WF of the electrodes. Organic interfacial modifiers such as polyethylene oxide, polyethyleneimine based structures and polyvinylpyrrolidone have been reported recently. Scheme 7 presents a few conjugated polymers used as the EEL for inverted OPVs. Tang et al. utilized a thin (<10 nm) cathode interlayer of conjugated polymer, poly(3,3′-([(9′,9′-dioctyl-9H,9′H-[2,2′-bifluorene]-9,9-diyl)bis(1,4-phenylene)]bis(oxy))bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine)) to improve the device performance. As a result, an approximately 20% enhancement was demonstrated in JSC and FF. Moreover, Cao's group also reported OPVs with enhanced PCEs by using an interlayer of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN). In addition, ethanol-soluble poly(9,9-bis(60-diethoxylphosphorylhexyl)fluorene) (PF-EP), quinoxaline-containing poly(4,5-ethylene-2,7-carbazole) (PECz-DTQx) have also been used as the interfacial layers. The conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), which consist of a conjugated backbone with side groups that carry ionic functionality have been identified as very promising materials for lowering the WF of the cathode. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy revealed that the enlarged VOC was attributed to the introduction of paralleled dipole moment due to the ultra-thin interfacial layer. Furthermore, the electric field from the interfacial dipole layer is estimated to be 6 × 105 V cm−1, which is orders of magnitude higher than that of the average built-in field in the control device under the short-circuit condition.

On the other hand, the interfacial layer without forming a dipole moment to enhance device performance have also been reported. The enhanced electrical conductivity of the interfacial layer resulted in enhanced JSC, where the VOC did not change because no dipole moments were induced. The representative work in this direction was demonstrated by our group. The details will be described in Section 4.

In comparison to the EEL, to effectively facilitate hole extraction, transportation and collection, the hole extraction layer has also been introduced in OPVs. HEL materials including PEDOT:PSS, graphene oxides (GOs), novel composites and semiconducting TMOs (MoO3, WO3, NiO and V2O5, etc.) have been introduced to modify the surface of the anode. However, most applications of solution-processed PEDOT:PSS, GOs and some novel composites were reported in OPVs with a conventional device structure. These materials were directly solution-deposited on the ITO/glass substrates followed with thermal annealing at various elevated temperatures. However, directly applying these materials on the top of a BHJ composite in inverted OPVs may cause some serious issues. For example, aqueous acidic PEDOT:PSS would cause degradation of conjugated polymers and give a poor contact with the hydrophobic photoactive layer. In addition, high-temperature annealing would also damage the film morphology of the BHJ active layer. In contrast, these issues can be avoided by using thermal-evaporated TMOs, which therefore, are the most widely used HEL materials in inverted OPVs.

TMOs including V2O5, MoO3 and RuO2 were first introduced as anode electrode modification interlayers to increase the hole-injection in OLEDs by Tokito et al. in the 1990s. The motivation for investigating these materials was mainly stemmed from their high WF, good semiconducting properties and high optical transparency, which are the critical characteristics for efficient charge carrier extraction and collection. By applying these TMOs in inverted OPVs, device efficiency can be dramatically boosted because of their abilities of tuning the effective WF of the electrode and keeping the excitons away from the electrodes to prevent undesired surface charge recombination. To efficiently select charge carriers, the WFs of the TMOs HEL need to be large enough to form a low resistance junction with the BHJ composite, lowering the energy barrier for hole extraction and preventing the electron “back-transfer” from the metals electrode to the BHJ composite. The WF of commonly used TMOs, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both D and A are summarized in Scheme 8. Proper selection of these materials can make a low resistance junction between the BHJ active layer and the HEL, which could minimize the energy loss during the charge extraction processes. Similar to the EEL, the HEL should also have other properties such as good electrical conductivity, robust chemical stability and easy-processability. Based on different mechanisms for the hole extraction, both n-type and p-type semiconductor TMOs can be used as efficient HELs to modify the anode in inverted OPVs.

n-Type semiconducting transition metal oxides (TMOs) such as MoOx, WO3 and V2O5 have been widely used as the HEL in inverted OPVs. It is noted that MoOx was previously reported as p-type semiconducting materials, with the LUMO (or electron affinity (EA)) and the HOMO (or ionization energy (IE)) located at −2.3 eV and −5.3 to −5.4 eV, respectively. However, they were recently unambiguously demonstrated to be n-type materials with very deep lying electronic states. The combined ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) spectra taken from MoOx, WO3 and V2O5 layers showed similar deep-lying electronic states, with the valance band (VB) edge located at −2.5 to −3 eV, which is below the Fermi level and the conduction band (CB) edge, as shown in Scheme 8. The n-type conducting properties was mainly originated from the slightly non-stoichiometric composition, with some oxygen deficiency proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

The applications of these TMOs as the HEL in OPVs have been widely studied despite of their n-type features. The WFs of these TMOs films are close to the HOMO (IE) energy levels of organic materials (Scheme 8), which allows the electrons to be transferred from the organic layer to the TMOs layer until a thermodynamic equilibrium is established across the interface, resulting in Fermi level pinning. Such band bending occurrences are described in Scheme 9a, which shows the energy level alignment and the band bending at the MoOx/4,4′-bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl (CBP) interface. The low HOMO energy level (or large IE) of MoOx (−9.7 eV) precludes the holes being transported via the VB. While the energy level difference between the LUMO energy level of MoOx and the HOMO energy level of CBP is small enough to ensure efficient electrons being transported among these two materials. Under the positive bias, the hole-injection into the organic film can take place due to the electron being transferred from the HOMO of CBP to the LUMO (CB) of MoOx. In OPVs, as shown in Scheme 9b, at the interface between the MoOx HEL and organic layer, the photo-generated holes in the electron donor polymers recombines with the electrons from the MoOx HEL, leaving the holes in the MoOx, which is equivalent to “hole-extraction”. Such “hole-extraction” model was also demonstrated with ITO/MoO3/NPD devices, as shown in Scheme 9c, where NPD is N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine. The hole-extraction via using above n-type TMOs layers is widely employed in inverted OPVs, although the “hole-extraction model” was of less awareness in most reports. Here the detailed application of MoOx, WOx and V2O5 in inverted OPVs will be summarized.

Among all the TMOs, MoOx shows premium device performance with easy processing such as thermal evaporation deposition and solution deposition. Thermally evaporated MoOx (e-MoOx) allows the film thickness to be controlled at a nanometer scale and gives a dense and uniform film. For e-MoOx, the oxygen deficiency causes the Fermi level to be close to the CB of MoOx. The WF of e-MoO3 is strongly dependent on the stoichiometry and highly sensitive to the surface contamination. Particularly, in oxygen or air, the WF decreases from 6.7 eV to −5.3 to −5.7 eV, but is still sufficient to yield good electrical junctions with organic hole transporting materials, given that the optimum HOMO level of polymers generally resides between −5.2 to −5.6 eV.

Small et al. showed that compared with the conventional bottom MoOx p-contact, enhanced ohmic contacts can be made in inverted OPVs via using e-MoOx and silver as a top p-contact. By using MoOx as the anode buffer layer in inverted OPVs, our group demonstrated high PCE of ∼8.6% from inverted OPVs. Cao's group further demonstrated a PCE of over 9%. Nevertheless, the processing of thermal evaporation still limits its application in large-scale production. To overcome this issue, solution-processed MoOx (s-MoOx) was introduced by Galatsis et al. via using sol–gel technology, though most solution-processed MoOx layers possess large surface roughness with trap states and require complicated processing procedures and high annealing temperature over 350 °C. A rather simple way to prepare high quality MoOx film without any thermal annealing processing has been developed in our group. The precursor solution was first prepared by dropwise adding H2O2 (30%) to molybdenum powder in an ice-water bath followed by further purification and then drying by heating, and then using methanol to dissolve the solid to get a precursor solution with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. The s-MoOx thin film was then spin-coated from the above precursor solution without further thermal annealing. By using an ultra-thin s-MoOx in OPVs, enhanced PCE of 4.55% for OPVs based on poly(thienothiophene-co-benzodithiophenes)7-F20 (PTB7-F20):PC71BM BHJ system and increased detectivity of 1.02 × 1013 Jones (detectivity at λ = 800 nm) for polymer photodetector based on poly(5,7-bis(4-decanyl-2-thienyl)thieno[3,4-b]diathiazole-thiophene-2,5) (PDDTT):PC71BM BHJ system, respectively, were observed. In comparison, Liu et al. also prepared a precursor solution by dissolving ammonium molybdate into a mixture of hydrochloric acid and de-ionized water. Girotto et al. prepared the precursors by directly dissolving MoOx powder into H2O2. Zilberberg et al. reported a precursor based on bis(2,4-pentanedionato)molybdenum(VI) dioxide isopropanol solution. Due to the rough manipulation in the solution process in comparison with thermal evaporation, the film quality of s-MoOx was inferior to that of e-MoOx. To obtain a high-quality s-MoOx film, the following requirements need to be considered: (1) the film roughness should be low enough to avoid pin-hole induced leakage current; (2) the processing should be simple to lower the manufacturing cost; (3) the WF of s-MoOx should not be sacrificed. Although s-MoOx possesses an advantage over e-MoOx in respect to manufacturing simplicity, the OPVs performance was inevitably restricted due to the direct deposition processing of s-MoOx on the surface of the photoactive layer. This is because that highly reactive precursors of s-MoOx may damage the organic materials. Moreover, the critical post-processing such as UV-plasma and high-temperature annealing may also damage the BHJ thin film morphology, which is precisely the prerequisite to high device performance.
In contrast, e-MoOx was widely employed in inverted OPVs as an alternative. Table 3 summarizes the major applications of e-MoOx in inverted OPVs. It is noted that in Choi's studies, high FF of 70% was achieved in inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/TiOx/FPQ-Br/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Au, which was 60% larger than that without the FPQ-Br interfacial modification layer. These results indicated that the contact between the photoactive layer and the MoOx layer is critical for approaching high PCE. Utilization of s-MoOx to realize full printing OPVs is another ongoing direction. Qiu et al. reported solution-processed Nafion-modified MoOx layer for an inverted OPVs with a comparable PCEs. However, the current bottle-necks are the poor contact between photovoltaic layer and s-MoOx and the low film quality of the s-MoOx layer.

WO3 is another n-type semiconductor with very deep lying electronic states, which are strongly dependent on its stoichiometry, crystalline structure and processing conditions. Similar to MoOx, thermally evaporated WO3 (e-WO3) is highly n-doped due to oxygen vacancies, which tunes the Fermi level close to the CB of WO3. Further oxygen deficiency would lead to metallic properties of WO2. Thus the surface contamination, particularly in air and oxygen, can strongly affect the final device performance of OPVs incorporated with WO3.

The application of WO3 in inverted OPVs was first reported by Tao et al. They claimed that the high WF of WO3 (−4.8 eV) would enhance the hole collection at the photoactive layer/Ag interface. OPVs with a device structure of ITO/TiOx/P3HT:PC61BM/WO3/Ag exhibited a VOC of 0.60 V and a FF of over 60%. The thickness of WO3 layer was controlled to be ∼10 nm, where a thicker film would introduce extra series resistance within itself and a thinner layer cannot effectively form a good contact between photoactive layer and the top electrode. Han et al. also reported an e-WO3 thin film with a notably small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.88 nm, which is favorable to make a good contact between the active layer and the HEL, thereby resulting in an over 70% FF. On the other hand, solution-processed WO3 (s-WO3) has also been demonstrated. Qiu et al. reported a PCE of 3.49% from OPVs based on P3HT:PC61BM system with the s-WO3 HEL, which was processed from bis(2,4-pentanedionato)molybdenum(VI) dioxide precursor solution. These results indicated s-WO3 is a promising candidate for large-scale solution-processed OPVs.

The third widely used n-type metal oxide as the anode buffer layer is V2O5, which possesses a band gap of 2.8 eV. It is noted that the WF of V2O5 (using thermal deposition processing in ultra-high-vacuum conditions <10−10 Torr) is −7.0 eV, which offers an excellent electrical junction between organic materials and the V2O5 HEL.

Early studies of vacuum-evaporated V2O5 (e-V2O5) layer as the anode buffer layer in OPVs with a conventional device structure of ITO/V2O5/BHJ composite/Al and an inverted device structure of ITO/Cs2CO3/BHJ composite/V2O5/Al were reported. Comparable device performance from OPVs with both conventional and inverted device structures indicated that V2O5 can be an efficient HEL in OPVs.
Similar to other n-type TMOs, the WF of V2O5 significantly depended on the processing methods. Especially, the WF of solution-processed V2O5 (s-V2O5) layers prepared by sol–gel method was relatively lower than that of e-V2O5. V2O5 layer processed from nanoparticles dispersions was also reported. However, the RMS of the s-V2O5 thin film was generally larger than that of the e-V2O5, which indicated the contact between the s-V2O5 HEL and the BHJ active layer would cause energy loss, resulting in an inferior PCE. For the s-V2O5 prepared by sol–gel deposition, high-temperature processing (>300 °C) is needed to achieve a certain microstructure or the pure crystalline phase, which, however, will cause the decomposition of the active layer materials in inverted OPVs. Instead, low-temperature solution-processed s-V2O5 has been reported in recent years. Zilberberg et al. reported sol–gel processed s-V2O5 HEL in inverted OPVs. A high work function of −5.3 eV was realized for s-V2O5 prepared in ambient air using vanadium(V)-oxytriisopropoxide as a precursor without any post-annealing or plasma treatment. Furthermore, Chen et al. employed a precursor solution of the vanadium(V) triisopropoxy oxide in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and deionized water to fabricate the s-V2O5 layer. Enhanced PCE was achieved by using s-V2O5 as the HEL in inverted OPVs, which was originated from the minimized interface defects, and reduced charge recombination and thereby decreased leakage current. In addition, Kololuoma et al. developed a stable and flexoprintable ink by modifying the vanadium alkoxide precursor with a appropriate type of coordinating ligands to print out the HEL for inverted OPVs. Although the PCE ranging from 3.5 to 4.5% was slightly lower than the reference cells using the vacuum-deposited V2O5 as the HEL, it still implied a bright vista for full-printable cheaper OPVs in the near future.

Different from n-type TMOs, p-type characteristics of NiO is originated from positive charge compensation at the thermodynamically favored Ni2+ vacancies. The WF of NiO is strongly dependent on the surface chemistry, crystal orientation and processing conditions. The surface of NiO film may adsorb surface contaminants (nitric oxide, carbonaceous and hydroxyl species) upon exposing in ambient air, leading to a decreased WF. Interestingly, Ratcliff et al. reported that O2 plasma treatment may increase the WF of NiO from −4.7 to −5.3 eV due to the dipolar nickel oxyhydroxide formed on the NiO surface. The NiO used in OPVs was first introduced by Irwin et al. An optimized ∼10 nm NiO layer was inserted between the BHJ active layer and the ITO anode by using pulsed laser deposition. Over 5% PCE was obtained from an OPV based on P3HT:PC61BM system. Recently, solution-processed NiO was also reported for OPVs.

Pure stoichiometric NiO is an excellent insulator, with an electrical conductivity in the order of 10−13 S cm−1 at room temperature, while after stoichiometric changes, the NiOx becomes a wide bandgap p-type semiconductor. For inverted OPVs, the NiO acts as both HEL and electron blocking layer on the top of the BHJ active layer. Appropriate methods for preparing premium NiO layers in inverted OPVs are still needed to be studied.

As aforementioned, TMOs such as ZnO, MoOx were widely used as the EEL and the HEL in inverted OPVs, respectively. However, poor electrical coherence at the organic/inorganic interface, would result in an inferior device performance. Such poor contact is originated from the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the metal oxide, which would cause charge trapping and high charge carrier recombination at the interface, leading to limited FFs in inverted OPVs. Therefore, the electrical properties of these TMOs need to be appropriately manipulated to minimize the resistance throughout the interfaces and maximize the charge carrier collection efficiency at the electrodes. On this concern, several modification materials are thereby introduced to improve the electrical properties of TMOs and thus boosting PCEs.


One of the factors that restrict the performance of inverted OPVs is the film morphology of the BHJ composite layer. Non-appropriate phase separation will generate geminate and non-geminate charge recombination, causing energy losses within OPVs. Therefore, it is imperative to decrease the series resistance across the interfaces and to simultaneously control the phase distribution in the BHJ active layer. One approach to solve these two issues synchronously is to insert an ultra-thin layer of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) between the inorganic charge extraction layer (HEL or EEL) and the BHJ active layer. Through the chemical reaction between the hydroxyl groups and the anchoring group (usually carboxylic acid and phosphoric acid) on the surface of metal oxides, a corresponding ester linkage can be formed. Thus, the SAMs can protect the metal oxide layer from organic solvent by the immobilized functional group, and also passivate the surface by terminating the hydroxyl groups on the metal oxides. Furthermore, the interactions between the BHJ active layer and the functional groups on the other side of the SAMs can also provide certain molecular stacking patterns by self-assembling. In this way, the stacking pattern of the conjugated polymer in the BHJ active layer can be tuned from “face-on” to “edge-on” in contacting with the bottom electrodes, which would facilitate charge carriers being transferred from the BHJ active layer to the corresponding electrodes.


Scheme 10 lists the chemical structures of several examples of non-cross-linkable SAMs as the interfacial modification layers for OPVs. Hau et al. first reported the use of fullerene derivative SAM (C60-SAM), terthiophene SAM (TT-SAM), benzoic acid SAM (BA-SAM) and lauric acid SAM (LA-SAM) to modify the interface of the TiOx/BHJ composite in inverted OPVs. The PCE of 2.8% from the control OPVs, to the PCE of 3.0% from LA-SAM modified OPVs, 3.2% from BA-SAM modified OPVs, 3.4% from TT-SAM modified OPVs and 3.8% from C60-SAM modified OPVs, were observed. The overall increased PCEs were originated from the improved interfacial contact by SAMs, which was proved by contact angle measurements. Among these SAMs, the greatest PCE improvement was obtained from inverted OPVs with C60-SAM modification. Such enhancement can be understood by an easier electron extraction process, where the good electron-withdrawing property of C60 molecules makes it much easier for photoinduced charge carriers to be transferred from the BHJ composite to the C60-SAM modification layer. The thin film morphology of the BHJ active layer tuned by underneath C60-SAM layer also led to the improved PCEs. Stacking patterns (face-on or edge-on), ordering (crystallinity) of conjugated polymers, and the film morphology of the BHJ active layer can also be influenced by the SAMs underneath to certain degrees. Hau also found that nano-structures of P3HT and accumulation of PC61BM to the bottom of the EEL interface have been increased by using a C60-SAM modification layer, which provided a better percolation conduction pathway for PC61BM, consequently improved the overall phase distribution and the BHJ film morphology, resulting in enhanced PCEs.
Different anchoring groups in fullerene-based SAMs can also be used to tune the device performance via decreasing the trap-states, tuning the energy level offset and improving the film morphology of the upper BHJ composite. Various C60-based SAMs with different anchoring groups (catechol, carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid), as shown in Scheme 10 (SAM[1–5]), have been used to improve OPVs performance. PCEs improved from 3.47% (without SAM modification) to ∼4.4% (with the carboxylic acid C60-SAMs), 4.19% (with the catechol C60-SAM), and 3.96% (with the phosphonic acid C60-SAM) were observed from inverted OPVs based on P3HT:PC61BM system. It was found that improvement in PCEs was mainly attributed to the enhancement in JSC and FF. Since the C60-SAM interlayer acted as an electron selective and hole blocking layer, charge recombination at the interface was minimized thanks to the improved charge transfer from the active layer to the ZnO layer. Other phosphonic acid-anchored C60-SAMs, as shown in Scheme 10, were also reported by Brabec et al. Due to the reduced series resistance and enhanced parallel resistance, improved PCEs (3.46%) was observed from OPVs using the phosphonic acid anchored C60-SAM (SAM-C6-C60 and SAM-C18-C60) interlayers and using P3HT:PC61BM active layer. To reduce the potential etching of ZnO, the utilization of less acidic terminal units or other anchoring groups have also been investigated. Therefore, C60-SAM with phosphoric ester groups, polyethylene glycol groups, amine groups have been developed to modify the interface of inorganic EEL and BHJ organic active layer or even to directly modify the electrode. Our group also reported an amine dendron modified C60-SAM (PCBM-G2 (Scheme 10)) as the interfacial layer in inverted OPVs and obtained a dramatically enhanced JSC and FF and an over 30% increase in PCE. The neutral property (ion-free) of PCBM-G2 used in OPVs indicated that no dipole moment was introduced at the EEL/active layer interface, which was further verified by the negligible change in VOC. The enlarged JSC and FF were originated from the greatly enhanced surface electrical conductivity of the EEL, which was evident by the peak force tunneling AFM (PFTUNA) measurement.
Beyond C60-SAM, non-fullerene based SAMs have also been developed to either enlarge the surface electrical conductivity of the EEL or to introduce a dipole to tune the energy level of the electrodes. Shi et al. reported a highly electrical conductive phenylthiophene-appended DPP, 3,6-bis-(5-benzoicacid-thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP-COOH) conjugated small molecule and a dye molecule di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719, Scheme 10) as the interfacial modification layer between the ZnO EEL and the BHJ active layer. The high charge carrier mobility of the interfacial SAMs minimized the energy barrier for charge transportation and extraction, improved the interface quality between the electrode and the BHJ active layer, and reduced the interfacial defect of the ZnO EEL, rendering an enhanced PCE of 8.2%. Kim et al. employed benzoic acid acid-derivatives with different dipole orientations and magnitudes (4-fluorobenzoic acid (FBA), 4-tert-butylbenzoic (BBA) and 4-methoxybenzoic acid (MBA) in Scheme 10) to modify the surfaces of the ZnO EELs. It was found that the dipole moment directed towards the ZnO EEL deteriorated the PCE while SAMs with the opposite dipole moment direction dramatically enhanced the PCE due to the enlarged VOC. In addition, by appropriate substitution, film morphology of the BHJ composite can also be influenced by the SAMs beneath to a certain degree, which gives rise to the change in JSC and FF.

The styrene group was initially employed as the cross-linkable SAMs interfacial layer because it could undergo rapid polymerization in the solid state to form polystyrene without the use of any initiators. Based on the favorable thermal curable property of styrene group, a fullerene derivative material [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD, Scheme 11), functionalized with small dendrons, has been reported by Cheng et al. The cross-linked PCBSD (C-PCBSD) network was formed by solution-processing on the top of the ZnO surface, followed by thermal curing at 160 °C for 30 min, which served as a robust and adhesive thin film with sufficient solvent resistance. By employing it in inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD/P3HT:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag, simultaneously enhanced VOC, JSC and FF have been realized. The enlarged JSC and FF were originated from the reduced energy barrier in the cascade pathway for the electrons and the P3HT/C-PCBSD interface for the exciton dissociation. The enhanced VOC was originated from a well-modified energy level of the ZnO EEL by C-PCBSD. By applying the C-PCBSD into the P3HT:indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) system, inverted OPVs also showed PCEs from 4.6 to 6.22%, indicating the general applicability of C-PCBSD. Furthermore, nanostructured C-PCBSD (vertically aligned, as shown in Scheme 12) was also introduced to provide a direct pathway for charge transport. Such vertically oriented C-PCBSD nanorods were constructed by using an anodic aluminum oxide template-assisted approach. The inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/C-PCBSD nanorods/P3HT:ICBA/PEDOT:PSS/Ag (Scheme 12) showed a decent PCE of 7.3%, with a large FF of 72.3%, VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 12.07 mA cm−2. The tremendous enhancement in PCE can be ascribed to the enlarged P3HT/C-PCBSD interfacial areas and enhanced electron mobility of C-PCBSD nanorods (2.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).

The oxetane group has also been utilized as an effective cross-linker in organic electronics. The ring-opening polymerization process of oxetane features low volume shrinkage of the surface layer and excellent adhesion on the substrates, the thin film can thereby be formed homogeneously without microcracks or defects. The non-acidic oxetane based SAMs also shows higher stability and eliminated acidic etching issues on ZnO layer in contrast to SAMs with carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid or chlorosilane anchoring groups. Specifically, an oxetane based SAM, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric oxetane dendron ester (PCBOD) was synthesized by Hsu et al., with a small dendron containing two oxetane groups as the crosslinkers, as shown in Scheme 11. The cationic oxetane ring-opening polymerization was incurred with a catalytic amount of photoacid generator under UV irradiation. By nucleophilic attack of hydroxyl groups on the TiOx EEL surface, the protonated oxetane rings could be opened, which would be anchored through etherification condensation by a possible bidentate anchoring reaction. Thus a vertically multimolecular interlayer can be formed through the ring-opening polymerization between oxetane groups, as shown in Scheme 11. The inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/TiOx/C-PCBOD/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag exhibited a decent PCE of 4.5%, with simultaneously improved VOC of 0.61 V, a JSC of 12.25 mA cm−2, and an FF of 61.26%.
Another group for cross-linkable-SAMs is trichlorosilane functionalities which can readily undergo facile hydrolysis to produce polysiloxane in ambient air and without complicated trigger conditions. Liang et al. presented a bis(2-(trichlorosilyl)propyl)malonate C60 (TSMC) (Scheme 11), which can spontaneously form a self-assembled and cross-linked monolayer (SA-C-TSMC) on the TiOx surface, without external thermal annealing or UV illumination. The operational mechanism is summarized in Scheme 12, where the nucleophilic hydroxyl groups on the TiOx surface would attack the electrophilic silicon atoms of trichlorosilanes to form a self-assembled monolayer via the Ti–O–Si linkages spontaneously, and intermolecular cross-linking between TSMC molecules through the siloxane Si–O–Si linkages also proceeds simultaneously. The inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/TiOx/SA-C-TSMC/P3HT:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag exhibited an enhanced PCEs from 3.2% (without interlayer) to 3.9% (with TSMC interlayer), with enhanced VOC from 0.58 to 0.60 V, JSC from 9.87 mA cm−2 to 10.42 mA cm−2, FF from 55 to 61.7%, respectively. Further application of SA-C-TSMC in inverted OPVs based on poly[diindenothieno(2,3-b)thiophene-alt-dithienylbenzothiadizole] (PDITTDTBT):PC71BM system exhibited a boosted PCE of 5.8%.

Water/alcohol soluble-conjugated polymers (WS-CPs) can be processed from either water or other polar solvents, which is compatible with roll-to-roll fabrication, possess a promising interfacial modification ability for metallic electrodes and show a great potential for applying environmentally friendly processing technologies. The polar solvent solubility of the WS-CPs interfacial layer, which originates from the hydrophobic polymer backbones and hydrophilic ionic functionalities, ensures the modification layer is not destroyed by the upper BHJ active layer and the modified surface would also facilitate charge transport from the BHJ active layer to the corresponding electrodes. In addition, the WS-CPs layer may also create a dipole moment at the interface, due to the specific functional groups (such as ethylene oxide, phosphonate, amino or ammonium, etc.). This interfacial dipole would give rise to an increased built-in potential (and hence VOC), and simultaneously, electron transport and collection are facilitated by the lowered WF of the cathode, resulting in a better band alignment and minimized contact resistance. As discussed in Section 3, the WS-CPs can be directly inserted between the ITO electrodes and the BHJ active layer to replace the traditional TMOs EEL (e.g., ZnO, TiOx), which simplifies the processing. The materials design and progress of WS-CPs was specifically reviewed by Cao et al. Here, recent applications of WS-CPs in inverted OPVs and enhancing the surface electrical conductivity of EEL for improving PCEs of OPVs will be emphasized.

In 2010, Na et al. demonstrated highly efficient inverted OPVs by interfacial modification via poly[(9,9-bis((6-((N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)-9-fluorene))dibromide)] (WPF-6-oxy-F) (Scheme 13). By inserting the WPF-6-oxy-F between the ITO anode and the BHJ active layer, VOC was enlarged from 0.35 to 0.65 V, JSC was enhanced from 8.05 to 8.83 mA cm−2, FF was enlarged from 37 to 59%, and correspondingly PCE was enhanced from 1.04 to 3.38% for inverted OPV with a device structure of ITO/WPF-6-oxy-F/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag. The enhanced VOC was attributed to the favorable interfacial dipole formed by WPF-6-oxy-F interlayer, which was confirmed by Kelvin probe study. The WF of the ITO anode was raised from −4.66 to −4.22 eV after WPF-6-oxy-F modification, which increased the built-in potential for maximizing VOC and minimizing the contact resistance.
Triphenylamine based cationic polyelectrolytes are another class of efficient interface modification materials, which have showed excellent applications in OLEDs. Xu et al. first employed triphenylamine based polyelectrolytes, poly[N-(4-(6-diethylphosphorylhexyloxy)phenyl)-4,4′-diphenylamine] (PTPA-EP) (shown in Scheme 13), in inverted OPVs. The diethyl phosphonate end groups on the side chains resulted in a good solubility in hydrophilic solvents, while the π-conjugated backbones possessed good semi-conducting properties. By employing the PTPA-EP into inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/PTPA-EP/PCDTBT:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag, the PCE was significantly enhanced from 2.57 to 4.59%. However, a PCE of 4.59% was still lower than that (5.13%) from inverted OPVs using ZnO EEL. In 2012, Zhu et al. dedicated a breakthrough work by using polycarbazoles interlayer, 2,7-carbazole-1,4-phenylene copolymers poly[(9-(N,N-di(200-hydroxyethyl)-60-aminohexyl)-2,7-carbazole)-alt-(2-hexyloxy-5-(N,N-di(200-hydroxyethyl)-60-aminohexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene)] (PCP-NOH) and poly[(N-(60-diethylphosphoryl)hexyl-2,7-carbazole)-alt-(2-hexyloxy-5-(60-diethylphosphoryl)hexyloxy-1,4-phenylene)] (PCP-EP), which comprise surfactant-like diethanolamino and phosphonate end groups on the side chains of the both main chain blocks, respectively, and possess good solubility in alcohol as well, as the ITO surface modifier. The inverted OPVs based on PCDTBT:PC71BM system showed an improved PCE from 1.63 to 5.39% for PCP-NOH and 5.48% for PCP-EP, respectively. Later on, 2,7-carbazole based WS-CPs, using a homopolymer of 2,7-carbazole with hydrophilic phosphonate side chains (PC-P) as the cathode interfacial modification layer, showed an increased PCE from 2.62% (control devices without incorporated with PC-P) to 6.04% (the OPVs incorporated with the ITO/PC-P as the bilayer cathode). Such modification on the WF of the ITO electrode eventually enlarged the VOC by 0.38 V which is even more effective than other poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives reported previously. Moreover, the polycarbazole main chain of PC-P created a good contact between the organic and inorganic layer, resulting in enhanced JSC and FF.
Various cationic polythiophene derivatives were reported for utilization as the EEL in both conventional and inverted OPVs. Zilberberg et al. reported poly(3-[6-(N-methylimidazolium)hexyl]thiophene)bromide (P3ImHT) (shown in Scheme 13) as an ultra-thin cathode interlayer to reduce the WF of ITO. By UV illumination, a reduction of the WF of ITO is originated from the formation of the dipole by the conjugated polyelectrolyte, which gives a suitable electron selective cathode, resulting in PCEs of 3.3 and 4.8% from inverted OPVs based on P3HT:PC61BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM systems, respectively. Similar modification layers have also been applied to boost PCEs of OPVs. Worfolk et al. developed poly[3-(6-{4-tert-butylpyridiniumyl}-hexyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl bromide] (P3(TBP)HT+Br−) (shown in Scheme 13) and further combined it with anionic PEDOT:PSS, serving as a versatile cathode buffer layer through electrostatic layer-by-layer (e-LBL) assembly. By varying the number of e-LBL layers, the WF of the electrode was precisely tuned from −4.6 to −3.8 eV. Using such cathode interfacial buffer layer in inverted OPVs, enhanced PCEs of 3.8 and 5.8% were observed from OPVs based on P3HT:PC61BM and poly({4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene}-2,6-diyl)-alt-({5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione}-1,3-diyl) (PBDTTPD):PC71BM BHJ systems, respectively. In addition, it was found that the corresponding inverted OPVs based on the P3HT:PC61BM BHJ system maintained 83% of its original PCE after 1 year of storage, which indicated a significantly improved device shelf-stability. Detailed stability studies for inverted OPVs will be addressed in Section 7.
It was reported that PFN can enhance the electron injection from high-WF metals cathode (Al) into organic active layer in PLEDs/OLEDs. Based on such favorable property for electron transporting, PFN and its derivatives have been utilized to modify the ITO surface in inverted OPVs. The most exciting result was observed from inverted OPVs with a PCE of 9.2%, where the PFN was used as the EEL. The WF of ITO was lowered from −4.7 to −4.1 eV by inserting a thin PFN layer between the ITO electrode and the BHJ active layer. Similar to other WS-CPs aforementioned, the origin of the vacuum level shift was originated from the formation of the interfacial dipole at the ITO surface by PFN. The inverted OPVs showed a PCE of 9.15%, with a JSC of 17.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.74 V and a FF of 72%; whereas the conventional OPVs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al showed a much lower JSC of 15.4 mA cm−2. The drastically increased JSC and thus PCE of the inverted OPVs were ascribed to the more efficient charge transport due to the interfacial modification by the PFN layer.
Metal oxide/conjugated polyelectrolytes bilayers were reported as ITO surface modifiers. In these studies, it was found that the polymer backbones which exhibited hydrophobic property was preferentially orientated to the side of the BHJ active layer, while the negative counterions with hydrophilic property was orientated to metal oxides. Such spontaneous orientations led to the formation of strong interfacial dipoles, lowering the conduction band of metal oxides and correspondingly facilitating electrons being transported from the BHJ composite through metal oxides to the cathode. A dramatically enhanced PCE (8.4%) was observed from inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/PFN-Br/PBDT–DTNT:PC71BM/MoOx/Al, where the PBDT–DTNT is poly{4,8-bis(4,5-didecyl-2-thienyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-[4,9-bis(4-hexyl-2-thienyl)naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole-5,5-diyl]}. The LUMO energy levels estimated from UPS were −4.46 eV for ZnO thin film and −4.08 eV for the ZnO/PFB-Br, respectively. The up-shift of the LUMO energy level of ZnO/PFN-Br would eliminate the energy barrier between the LUMO energy level of PC71BM and the CB of ZnO, resulting in a large VOC. The OPVs with PFN-Br layer exhibited nearly 10 times smaller dark current than that of the OPVs without PFN-Br, indicating a larger VOC and suppressed bimolecular charge recombination. In addition, Choi et al. found that the insertion of a thin WS-CPs layer could increase the hydrophobicity of TiOx, originated from the improved wettability by conjugated polyelectrolytes, resulting in enhanced PCEs.
The dipole-induced low WF of the ITO electrode and the modified surface wettability by WS-CPs provided a good contact between the ITO electrode and the BHJ active layer, resulting in an efficient pathway for electron extraction and transport. However, the neglected low surface electrical conductivity of the buffer layer still limits the PCEs of OPVs, in particular, for WS-CPs of larger thickness. The dramatically reduced electrical conductivity would introduce a series resistance within the WS-CPs layer and lower the charge transport efficiency. To address such issues, Liu et al. designed a novel metallopolymer, Hg-containing derivative of amino-functionalized conjugated polymers (PFEN-Hg) (Scheme 13) as the interfacial modification layer. This novel conjugated polymer possesses strong intermolecular and noncovalent Hg–Hg interactions, which would result in increased packing of the PFEN-Hg thin film. The OPVs incorporated with PFEN-Hg showed a small variation of PCEs from 8.64 to 9.11%, even when the thickness of PFEN-Hg was increased to 19 nm. By contrast, inverted OPVs incorporated with poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)hexyl)fluorene)] PFN-OX (Scheme 13) exhibited PCEs from 9.03 to 1.02% as the thickness of PFN-OX is raised from 4 to 7 nm.
Our group observed a PCE of 8.62% from inverted OPVs incorporated with the PFN-OX EEL, as shown in Scheme 14c. A PCE of 7.24% from inverted OPVs with a BHJ active layer with over 1 μm thickness has been further demonstrated. The inverted OPVs with such thick BHJ active layer provided a good opportunity for commercializing OPVs products.
In short, WS-CPs are promising candidates to replace or modify metal oxides or metal carbonate EELs. WS-CPs used as the interfacial layer can increase the surface electrical conductivity and the hydrophobicity of the ITO or metal oxide/metal carbonate layer, which facilitates the electron transport. In addition, surface charge carrier recombination can also be suppressed by the introduction of WS-CPs. As a result, both enhanced JSC and FF were observed from the OPVs incorporated with WS-CPs modification layer.

In OPVs, thin film morphology of the BHJ active layer plays a critical role in determining the device performance. Due to the relatively low dielectric constant of the BHJ composite, large exciton-binding energy gives rise to strongly localized electron–hole pairs in BHJ active layers, which requires additional driving force to separate the pair of electrons and holes. The energy level offsets between D and A provide an additional electric field with different electrochemical potentials at the molecular interface to separate the excitons into weakly bounded Coulombic pairs, and thereafter separating into free charge carriers. To enlarge the D/A interface, BHJ concept was further introduced to simultaneously enlarge the charge dissociation. Therefore, the manipulation of the film morphology of the BHJ active layer has always been the focus in the field of OPVs. For OPVs, almost all the organic active layers are processed from solution, and the difference in surface energy of D and A will leads to an inhomogeneous vertical distribution (or concentration gradient) and phase separation throughout the BHJ active layer, causing “vertical phase separation”, which is crucial to the charge transport and device efficiency. The model of vertical composition profile of P3HT:PC61BM system using variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry was reported by Campoy-Quiles et al. A concentration gradient varying from PC61BM-rich domains near the PEDOT:PSS side to P3HT-rich domains adjacent to the free (air) surface was reported in the conventional OPVs, where such a composition profile was inefficient for corresponding charge transport and collection. Alternatively, inverted OPVs with reversed charge transport directions showed an advantage over the conventional OPVs because of the vertical phase separation. In inverted OPVs, the surface energy difference induce a D-rich phase more close to the anode on the top and the A-rich phase more close to the cathode beneath, thus shortening charge transport pathways and reducing charge recombination at the electrodes. Besides the surface energy difference induced self-assembly of the BHJ active layer, to achieve a more optimized vertical morphology via thermal annealing, processing additives, external electrical field and external magnetic field are reviewed as detailed below.


Thermal annealing is a common process to tune the thin film morphology of the BHJ active layer in OPVs. Xu et al. conducted a series of experiments to study the influence of thermal annealing on the compositions at the top and bottom surfaces of BHJ blend films by XPS. P3HT:PC61BM blend film coated on both glass and Cs2CO3 were fast-grown, fast-grown with thermal annealing, slow-grown, slow-grown with thermal annealing, or respectively. The weight ratios of P3HT and PC61BM were detected by using C/S atomic ratios from the XPS measurement. Both fast-grown and slow-grown film showed similar results, with higher PC61BM concentration at the bottom surface. However, upon thermal annealing, PC61BM concentrations at both sides of the fast-grown films decreased slightly while the slow-grown films remained invariable, reflecting higher thermodynamically stability for slow-grown films. Moreover, the PC61BM concentration at the Cs2CO3/polymer interfaces is higher than that at the glass/polymer interfaces, illustrating that the vertical separation in the BHJ composite is induced by Cs2CO3. Similar to the results on the glass substrate, BHJ films on the surface of Cs2CO3 also exhibited enhanced inhomogeneous distribution after thermal annealing. The ratio of PC61BM to P3HT at the Cs2CO3 side increased over one- and two-fold in the fast and slow-grown films, respectively, while at the top side (top surface of the BHJ film), the ratio of PC61BM to P3HT slightly decreased in both fast- and slow-grown films. It was also proposed that not only surface energy contributed to the PC61BM aggregation on the bottom surface, but also charge transfer processes played a critical role. Such a hypothesis was supported by XPS measurement, which showed a significant binding energy shift (∼0.5 eV) to lower binding energy for Cs after spin-coating an ultra-thin PC61BM layer and consequently resulted in a substantial charge transfer. These results are consistent with the previous studies by Ohno et al. that the charge transfer process was originated from the dipole formed by Cs2CO3 on the ITO substrate, inducing the dipole–dipole interaction between PC61BM and Cs2CO3. Later on, Orimo et al. demonstrated that pre-annealing of the active layer before thermal deposition of metal electrode and post-annealing after thermal deposition would cause significant differences in the film morphology of the BHJ composite. The XPS measurements showed that the surface fraction of PC61BM at the interface between the BHJ layer and the Al electrode was as low as 31% in the pre-annealing device but was enhanced to 72% in the post-annealing device. The higher PC61BM concentration for the post-annealing device was likely attributable to the larger diffusion constant of small molecules (PC61BM) than that of polymer chains. This deduction can be further supported by the study from Ma et al., who showed a reduced efficiency for conventional OPVs with pre-annealing of P3HT:PC61BM film but an increased efficiency with post-annITO/WPF-oxy-F/P3HT:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag,ealing. However, Kang et al. reported different results. Based on the device structure of where the WPF-oxy-F is poly[(9,9-bis((6′-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexyl)-2,7-fluorene))-alt-(9,9-bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)fluorene)] dibromide, PCEs from 2.13% for the pristine OPVs to 3.86% for the post-annealing OPVs under 170 °C were observed. By studying the annealing sequences for different layers, it was found that the most correlated interface was the active layer/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. VOC was slightly enhanced due to the increased WF of the PEDOT:PSS/Ag bi-electrode along with raised temperature from 110 to 170 °C. Consequently, good ohmic contact could be formed between the PEDOT:PSS/Ag bilayer electrode and P3HT, resulting in an increased VOC and reduced series resistance (RS). Moreover, sheet resistance (Rsh) was increased by two orders of magnitude after annealing at 170 °C, due to the smaller leakage current at negative voltage and low positive voltage. The combined reduced RS and increased Rsh resulted in an enhanced FF and thus PCE. Based on these researches, it can be concluded that post-annealing process will not only influence the vertical charge separation between the electron donor and the electron acceptor, but also change the interfacial properties. Therefore, different annealing sequences should be chosen to optimize the OPVs performance.


Using different solvents to tune the film morphology of the BHJ composite has also been attempted, which, however, do not enhance PCEs dramatically in initial studies. But derived from this idea, Yao et al. first employed the processing of additives, in particular high boiling solvent additive 1,8-octanedithiol (OT or 1,8-ODT) with the combination of low boiling point solvent 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), to optimize the film morphology of the BHJ active layer and obtained a difference in PCEs. Thin film morphology studies indicated that a vertical phase separation occurred during the spin-coating process, which was supported by AFM images and XPS measurement. Highly ordered domains of P3HT were observed within the BHJ composites incorporated with OT additive, facilitating hole transportation in inverted OPVs. The underlying device physics can be explained by the model shown in Scheme 15. Since P3HT and PC61BM are dissolved in DCB with low concentrations, polymer chains extend freely in the solvent without interaction with PC61BM. However, during the spin-coating process, PC61BM molecules were dispersed between the P3HT chains because of the evaporation of solvent, breaking the ordering of the P3HT chains. However, with incorporation of processing additive OT, the film showed a much more ordered phase separation (as shown in Scheme 15d–f). During the spin-coating process, DCB evaporates much faster than OT and the concentration of OT is gradually increased in the wet film. Due to the limited solubility of PC61BM in OT, PC61BM will form clusters and be easy to aggregate. On the other hand, the surface energy of PC61BM is higher than that of P3HT, which gives rise to a redistribution with the PC61BM rich phase accumulated at the bottom of the active layer, leaving the P3HT rich phase in the top of the active layer. Consequently, the electron percolation pathways of PC61BM rich phase at the bottom and hole percolation pathways of P3HT rich phase in the top would facilitate the charge extraction process, rendering a higher JSC. Later on, Lin et al. applied this strategy in inverted OPVs with the PCPDTBT:PC71BM BHJ system. By adding high boiling solvent additive 1,8-ODT in DCB, PCE was increased from 2.09 to 3.00%. Great enhancement was observed from JSC (from 9.89 to 12.84 mA cm−2). Similarly, Chen et al. employed a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene (DCB) with diiodooctane (DIO) additive in inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag. PCE was increased from 0.92% (BHJ composites from pure chlorobenzene) to 4.43% (BHJ composites from 1:1 DCB:CB + 2% DIO). It was found that the JSC contributed to the major part of enhancement in PCEs, rising from 3.78 to 11.82 mA cm−2. The mixed solvent effect on device performance was also demonstrated by our group. Yi et al. investigated the device performance of OPVs fabricated from chlorobenzene solution with different concentrations of solvent processing additive, chloronaphthalene (CN), which has a high boiling point. By adding CN into chlorobenzene solution, it was found that the film morphology of the BHJ layers was tuned and the crystalline degree of the conjugated polymers is maintained. The optimized BHJ film morphology would facilitate more excitons to be diffused into the D/A interface and then dissociated into free charge carriers. A higher JSC is thus obtained. Liu et al. also investigated the influence of binary processing additives on the performance of OPVs and obtained a PCE of 8.55%, which was also originated from the optimized morphology of the BHJ active layer. A morphological change induced suppressed charge carrier recombination was also demonstrated, and enhanced JSC and FF, as well as a corresponding higher PCE was realized.


It has been reported that the external bias imposed on OPVs can enhance the efficiency of OPVs due to the better arrangement of conjugated polymers in the BHJ active layer. However, the reason for the improved performance has not been well elucidated, since the extra charges injected by the external field can also fill in the defects in organic layer, rendering less charge carrier recombination. Apart from directly applying an external electric field on the electrodes of the OPVs, Ma et al. studied the electrical field influence on the P3HT:PC61BM active layer during the filming process. The BHJ active layer was placed between two parallel metal plates with bias voltage applied to them, forming an electric field perpendicular to the OPVs, as shown in Scheme 16a. A forward electric field was defined as the direction from glass to the active layer, and the opposite was defined as the backward electric field. With the backward electric field treatment, the efficiency was improved from 3.16% of control device (without external electrical field) to 3.23% (with backward electric field strength of 2.5 × 105 V m−1) and 3.51% (with backward electric field strength of 5.0 × 105 V m−1) of electric field treated devices, respectively. On the contrary, with the forward electric field treatment, the efficiency decreased to 3.09% (with forward electric field strength of 2.5 × 105 V m−1) and 3.04% (with forward electric field strength of 5.0 × 105 V m−1). Scheme 16b shows the schematic description of different vertical phase separation with different electric field treatments. The authors claimed the electric field can induce the rearrangement of polymer chains by electrical dipolar interaction, giving rise to well-ordered polymer chains and PC61BM side chains. The formation of well-ordered active layer morphology facilitated the charge transportation and therefore resulted in enhanced JSC. The polarity direction of PC61BM is from the side chain to the fullerene, so with the backward electric field, the side chains of PC61BM will be aligned upward to restrain the diffusion of PC61BM to the top, decreasing the tendency of self-assembled PC61BM forming PC61BM-rich domains at the top surface. Consequently, the backward electric field helped the formation of P3HT-rich domains at the top surface and PC61BM-rich domains at the bottom. The P3HT-rich layer provides more channels for the holes to be transported to the anode and reduced the probability of electron–hole recombination at the anode. Thus, the current leakage was decreased, which led to increased shunt resistance and consequently enhanced FF. On the contrary, the forward electric treatment has the opposite influence on the vertical phase distribution. Despite the interesting explanations, further considerations on the polarizing effect within the active materials as well as the direct evidence for the vertical phase change remains to be addressed.


Our group reported BHJ composite mixed with Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and then employed the external magnetic field to drive the alignment of Fe3O4 MNPs during the filming process. Well-developed D–A morphology was induced and the introduced dipole moment from the aligned Fe3O4 MNPs offer an additional coercive field to direct the separated charge carriers to be transported to the corresponding electrodes, resulting in a dramatically reduced charge carrier recombination. The aligned Fe3O4 MNPs in the BHJ composite were confirmed by grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, and that such aligned “channels” induced enlarged charge mobility was further confirmed by the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. Scheme 17a shows the processing procedures of the external magnetic field aligned Fe3O4 MNPs in the BHJ composite. In addition, the idea of using the external magnetic field induced motion of Fe3O4 MNPs to tune the morphology of the BHJ composite matrix was also employed in the HEL. The employment of Fe3O4 MNPs and the external magnetic field has also been applied in a PEDOT:PSS layer to optimize the film morphology of the HEL, which results in a dramatically enlarged electrical conductivity and consequently an enhanced PCE.Scheme 17b shows the processing procedures and differences in the resulting device performances. In addition, it should be noted that pristine Fe3O4 MNPs with or without external magnetic field alignment can also applied as the HEL in OPVs and the external magnetic field may also give positive influence on the device performance.


In the previous sections, charge extraction, transport and collection at the interface of the cathode electrode and active layer have been addressed. To realize a balanced charge collection, the charge extraction, transport and collection at the anode side are also of importance in determining device performance. For simplest metal–semiconductor–metal photovoltaic devices, VOC is demonstrated to scale the difference between the WF of the cathode and the anode in conditions of non-ohmic contact, and to exhibit a strong coupling with the reduction potential of the electron acceptor in conditions of ohmic contact. Hau et al. investigated the influence of different top electrodes materials on the device performance of inverted OPVs. Based on the structure of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC61BM/top electrode, VOC showed a linear relationship with the anode WF, with a slope of 0.6. However, after incorporating PEDOT:PSS between the anode electrode and the BHJ active layer, VOC remained almost invariant with different anodes. This observation was consistent with the results reported by Brabec, indicating the utilization of an efficient HEL would allow the use of inexpensive materials as the anode electrodes.


Currently, flexible transparent conducting electrodes have garnered close attention due to the advances in technologies for flexible optoelectronics, which requires highly transparent conducting materials for both top and bottom electrodes. Moreover, the transparent top electrode enables the substitution of ITO with much cheaper opaque substrate, such as insulated steel or metal covered glass. As introduced as the top electrodes in the Section 2, nanostructured conducting materials such as silver nanowires (Ag-NWs), CNTs, graphenes and highly conductive polymers, which are fabricated from the latest state-of-the-art technologies, have been developed as flexible transparent electrodes to conquer the disadvantages of the conventional electrodes, such as brittleness, opacity and low electrical conductivity. Among them, Ag-NWs stood out as the one of the most promising candidates due to their much higher electrical conductivity and transmittances (10–20 Ω sq−1 with 85% transmittance over the wavelength from 400 to 800 nm). In the following context, the topic will be focused on the development of Ag-NWs as the top electrode in inverted OPVs.

In 2008, Ag-NWs was first investigated by Peumanns et al., as a substitution for the ITO electrode. They observed a low shunt resistance of less than 1 kΩ cm2, with a PCE of only 0.38%. The lower efficiency was solely due to the leakage current, which was the result of the extremely rough Ag-NWs electrode. To mitigate the large roughness induced harmful influence, the Ag-NWs films were further pressed with a clean glass substrate to flatten the nanowire mesh prior to lamination. A significantly improved PCE of 2.5% was obtained. However, a low FF of 46% was observed, which was ascribed to the inherent large roughness of the Ag-NWs layer. To address this issue, an inorganic–organic composite consisting of Ag-NWs and PEDOT:PSS was developed. The conductive PEDOT:PSS could fill the gaps among Ag-NWs, which would not only smooth the film surface, but also increase the electrical conductivity of Ag-NWs. Similar efforts to improve the properties of Ag-NWs were also made by other groups in recent years, and the applications of such technology are pervasive in conventional OPVs and OLEDs. Later on, such structure was further employed in visible-light transparent inverted OPVs by Yang's group. They demonstrated high performance, visible transparent OPVs fabricated from an all-solution process. It is noteworthy that Ag-NWs fused with TiOx NPs and PEDOT:PSS were used as the top electrode, where the Ag-NWs were treated by TiOx and PEDOT:PSS solution sequentially. Tighter contact among the crossed Ag-NWs and improved film electrical conductivity was achieved due to the TiOx solution volume shrinkage and solvent evaporation while the PEDOT:PSS coating acts as a protecting layer for strong adhesion. Consequently, such treatment resulted in a highly conductive Ag-NW composite films possessing excellent optical transparency (over 80% in the visible region) and mechanical properties. A decent PCE over 4% was obtained for inverted OPVs using poly(2,6′-4,8-bis(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo-[1,2-b;3,4-b]dithiophene-alt-5-dibutyloctyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione) (PBDTT-DPP):PC61BM BHJ system. Later in 2013, Rein et al. also demonstrated semi-transparent OPVs, where PEDOT:PSS and V2O5 were separately used as the HEL for solution processed Ag-NWs top electrode. It is noted that using higher electrical conductive material connecting to Ag-NWs electrodes resulted in a more efficient charge collection process and led to a high PCE of 2.37% for the semi-transparent OPVs.

Another efficient and attractive candidate for the top electrode in inverted OPVs is PEDOT:PSS, which has been widely utilized as the top electrode. In 2008, Zhou et al. first reported the high electrical conducting PEDOT (PH500) as the anode electrode in all-solution-processed transparent inverted OPVs. However, a relatively low PCE of 0.7% was observed, which was attributed to the less efficient absorption and a poor contact with the cathode. Afterwards, Hau et al. demonstrated OPVs using PEDOT:PSS as both bottom and top electrodes, respectively. In this work, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to increase the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. When DMSO doped PEDOT:PSS was used as the bottom electrode to replace ITO electrode, as the thickness of DMSO doped PEDOT:PSS layer was increased, the optical transparency and sheet resistance were reduced, which lowered the photocurrent but increased the FF. By tuning the thickness of DMSO doped PEDOT:PSS cathode electrode, and applying Ag as the anode electrode, a PCE of ∼3% was observed. In addition, the DMSO doped PEDOT:PSS electrode showed higher compatibility with flexible substrate with regard to its superior mechanical properties than that of the ITO electrode, exhibiting improved PCE retention (92%) over that of the ITO (50%) electrode after cyclic bending test for the corresponding OPVs. Later on, similar structures and processing methods of PEDOT:PSS were reported by other groups. However, using PEDOT:PSS as the transparent top electrode was severely hampered by poor wettability of this hydrophilic material dispersion on hydrophobic organic active layer surfaces. To solve this problem, Zhou et al. used a combination of a modified PEDOT:PSS (Clevios CPP 105D) and PH1000 to increase the hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS and enabled it to be spin-coated on an organic active layer surface. An alternative technique to overcome this incompatible surface potential was to use stamp transfer lamination of dry PEDOT:PSS film, which was conducted by Gupta et al. They demonstrated a high conducting (900 S cm−1) PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) layer, deposited by a stamp-transfer lamination technique using a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp. To further minimize the resistive losses in the large area devices, PEDOT:PSS was incorporated with an Ag grid electrode, providing a proficient and versatile transparent top contact. The processing procedure is shown in Scheme 18. The resulting PCE was 2.35%, with a JSC of 9.39 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.54 V and FF of 48%. Even though a relatively lower value of FF was obtained, which was originated from the leakage pathways from the non-optimized interfacial contact, it still provided a possible way to gear up the utilization of PEDOT:PSS as an more efficient and compatible electrode in inverted OPVs.


Transparent top cathode composed by thin-film of metal layers such as Ag/Al and Ag/Au have low transmittance (<60%), indicating that more than 40% of the incident light was reflected at the surface of the top electrode, resulting in low PCE of OPVs. Therefore, in order to circumvent these problems, a series of top electrodes utilizing dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) structure to enhance the transmittance have been developed.

In 2009, Tao et al. first demonstrated dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) structure with a high optical transmittance (>75%) in the visible region by thermal evaporation, where Ag is sandwiched between two layers of MoOx with different thicknesses. The inner MoOx layer was utilized as the HEL and the outer MoOx layer is used not only as the top-capping layer to enhance light coupling, but also to lower the series resistance of photovoltaic devices. This is because the MoOx/Ag anode would cause a large amount of internal reflection at the metal/air interface due to large refractive index mismatches. The top MoOx layer could serve as a transparent conducting index matching layer to enhance the total transmission due to the higher refractive index of MoOx (∼2.1). Therefore, by tuning the thickness of the outside MoOx layer to the optimum condition (MoOx/Ag/MoOx, 1/10/20 nm), transmittance is increased in the visible region compared to the MoOx/Ag anode electrode. As a consequence, OPVs with a device structure of ITO/TiOx/P3HT:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag/MoOx showed an enhanced PCE of 1.40% compared to that (1.04%) using MoOx/Ag anode electrode. Slightly reduced JSC (from 4.04 mA cm−2 to 3.85 mA cm−2) was due to the lower reflectivity of MoOx/Ag/MoOx in the wavelength range 400–650 nm.
Even though the PCE from the multilayer anode electrode was not inspiring, it still provided a promising alternative for the transparent top electrode for inverted OPVs. Three critical requirements can be summarized for effective transparent top electrode: (1) the thin dielectric layer adjacent to the organic active layer serves to transport the holes and block the electrons, which should form an ohmic contact with the photoactive layer; (2) tuning the thickness of Ag is very important for balancing the sheet resistance and optical transmittance; (3) the outer dielectric layer incorporated as a light coupling layer is of great importance to tune the optical properties of the anode electrode and particularly mitigate deleterious reflections caused by the large mismatch of refractive indices at the Ag/air interface.
Based on these principles, Jin et al. demonstrated the application of the DMD top electrode in 25.0 cm2 large area OPVs monolithic sub-modules. The optimized MoOx/Ag/MoOx showed an optical transmission of 80% at 520 nm, and a sheet resistance of ∼5 Ω sq−1. The inverted OPVs with a device structure of glass/Al/PCDTBT:PC71BM/MoOx/Ag/MoOx showed a PCE of 3.17% in large scale, which outperformed the equivalent conventional OPVs. FF from large area devices with the DMD electrode maintained almost unchanged with the laboratory-scale cells, while the conventional OPVs show a dramatic loss in FF to <30% when it was fabricated on large-scale. This indicated that at large scale, the power loss in OPVs was derived from the anode whose sheet resistance becomes the only area-scaling parameter. Consequently, this study opened new opportunities to create modules and sub-modules with high geometric FFs and more efficient use of substrate area.
DMD structures were also utilized in inverted OPVs as the bottom electrode for the ITO-free cells or in the conventional-semi-transparent-OPVs, which also exhibited promising results. Further studies of multilayer transparent electrode are necessary for the realization of large scale and transparent OPVs.

Generally, in most conventional OPVs, the BHJ active layer is sandwiched between the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO/glass and the low-WF metal, where both PEDOT:PSS and low-WF metal will cause stability issues. The stability of OPVs can be divided into air stability and thermal stability in terms of the materials stability. For air stability, the degradation of OPVs mainly results from the diffusion of oxygen and moisture, leading to the oxidation of aluminum cathode and active layer. In addition, moisture would facilitate the acidic PEDOT:PSS to etch the ITO/glass. For thermal stability, the phase-separated morphology of BHJ blends is thermodynamically metastable and the materials still have a certain degree of freedom to diffuse slowly or recrystallize over time. Furthermore, the facilitated interaction between the active layer and PEDOT:PSS or low-WF metal would inevitably deteriorate the device performance. To solve these problems, inverted OPVs were introduced. As mentioned above, in this structure, stable EEL, HEL and high-WF metal were introduced to replace the unstable PEDOT:PSS and low-WF metals.


The commonly used electrode in the conventional OPVs is a metal of low WF, including Al and Ca, which is highly reactive to oxygen and moisture. Among them, the dominant degradation is the diffusion of oxygen and water through pores in the metal and the chemical reaction to form metal oxide, such as Al2O3, which is an insulator and may create a barrier for charge carrier transport. Krebs and Norrman conducted a systematic work on the oxygen induced degradation by using time of flying-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) methodologies for over 13000 h. They found that there were two main pathways for oxygen diffusion into OPVs: pin-poles within the metal electrode and edges between the electrodes and active layer. Moreover, the electrodes such as Al, was believed to be gradually dissolved in the constituents of active layer and formed kinds of organoaluminum species at the Al/C60 interface, which was confirmed by using isotope 18O marking method. Therefore, to achieve long-term stable OPVs, chemically robust metal electrodes such as Ag need to be used as the electrode instead of the unstable Al. Hau and Yip et al. compared the device stability between the conventional OPVs and inverted OPVs by using the P3HT:PC61BM BHJ system. All of the four basic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) of the conventional OPVs have a dramatic decline showing the degradation in the first five days, while inverted OPVs still maintain over 90% performance, as shown in Fig. 1.

On the other hand, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS (pH = 1) makes it corrosive to the low WF electrode metal and the ITO electrode. Kawano et al. studied the effect of the PEDOT:PSS layer on the degradation of poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) based OPVs and found a large dependence of stability on the environmental humidity. The humid condition led to a rapid degradation in PCE of OPVs incorporated with PEDOT:PSS either in air or in nitrogen. While for OPVs without PEDOT:PSS, the degradation became much slower. The authors concluded that the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS layer took up water from the atmosphere, increasing the sheet resistance. Another research done by Voroshazi et al. showed that PEDOT:PSS will also enhance the oxidation of the cathode due to the hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS. In inverted OPVs, TMOs such as MoOx were deposited as the HEL instead of the acidic PEDOT:PSS layer to improve the stability. The chemical susceptibility to moisture and oxygen of TMOs are less sensitive than that of PEDOT:PSS thin films, thus the acidic ions diffusion into active layer and ITO electrodes can be eliminated. Various studies have shown that the lifetime of inverted OPVs using the TMOs HELs can be increased dramatically. Our group also demonstrated that by using TMOs such as Fe3O4 MNPs as the HEL in the conventional OPVs to eliminate the PEDOT:PSS, the device stability was significantly enhanced. It should be noted that the degradation in OPVs comprises a complex range of mechanisms that presumably have not been completely identified. Besides the moisture and oxygen diffusion induced device performance degradation, the degradation of interfaces, active materials, interlayer and electrode diffusion, reaction between the electrode and organic materials, as well as film morphological changes including delamination and crack formation can also cause device performance degradation. Although for a long time, the moisture and oxygen diffusion are known as the dominant degradation mechanisms, a quantitative understanding in performance degradation of inverted OPVs still remains a challenging task.

Beyond the shelf stability, the operational stability for inverted OPVs with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/BHJ composite/MoOx/Ag was also investigated by our group. As shown in Fig. 2, inverted OPVs with ZnO buffer layer showed no obvious degradations in JSC, VOC and FF after continuously illuminating OPVs for 4 h. However, for inverted OPVs without ZnO buffer layer, significant degradations in VOC, FF and JSC were observed after continuously illuminating OPVs only for 1 h. All these results indicated that inverted OPVs by using ZnO as the buffer layer had a good operational stability, whereas inverted OPVs without ZnO buffer layer were unstable under the illumination condition. By studying the absorption of ZnO, it is concluded that a good operational stability of inverted OPVs with ZnO buffer layer was probably originated from the blocking effect of the ZnO layer against the UV light, which resulted in a negligible UV light induced photodegradation of organic materials.

During the solar cell operation, another inevitable issue is the heat effect from the continuous exposure in the solar irradiation. The accumulated heat may accelerate the molecular diffusion between layers and in the BHJ nano-composite. Although the diffusion of the acidic ions in PEDOT:PSS to adjacent layers to degrade the ITO or conjugated polymers can be eliminated in inverted OPVs, the elevated temperature in the BHJ composite may induce film morphological change within the active layer. In addition, due to the relatively low glass transition temperature (Tg) of commonly used conjugated polymers, as well as the thermally induced polymeric crystallization at higher temperatures, the BHJ D–A phase separation can be driven from nanoscale to a detrimental microscale or even macroscale, which is significantly larger than the exciton diffusion length. In addition, concomitant D/A interface reduction is also expected. To address the thermal issues, strategies including introducing compatibilizers to store the extensive thermal energy within the active layer and reduce the interfacial tension between D–A phases, developing cross-linkable active light harvest materials to form a robust BHJ network, employing amorphous aggregation inhibitor or fullerene derivatives to substitute PCBM, lowering the effective regioregularity of conjugated polymers to suppress the thermal induced crystallisation at high temperatures, and developing high Tg active layer materials with reduced rotational freedom to maintain the BHJ morphology, have been developed. However, it should be noted that although various methods have been developed to maintain the ∼10 nm D–A separation, the charge transport properties within the active layer may somewhat be sacrificed due to the introduction of insulating additives or the formation of disordered phases. The trade-off between exciton transport and charge carrier transport still remain unsolved.

As discussed above, inverted OPVs have been developed to address the stability issues of conventional OPVs by introducing more air-stable TMOs as the electrode buffer layer and high-WF metals as the electrode. Additionally, the application of multi-functional robust electrode buffer layers and interfacial modification layers not only prolongs the device lifetime but also improves the device performance to a certain degree. Specifically, strong development efforts for electrode buffer layers and interfacial modification layers enable them to ameliorate the contact between the organic and inorganic interfaces and to optimize the electrical coherence throughout the devices and boost the charge collection efficiency. Moreover, due to the reversed polarity in inverted OPVs, surface energy difference would induce self-optimized vertical D–A phase redistribution. Tremendous works has been done to further optimize the D–A morphology by critically tuning processing conditions such as thermal annealing, using processing additives and exerting external fields. By properly selecting materials, over 10% PCEs have been realized since early 2014 in inverted OPVs. Although the highest PCE of 11.0 ± 0.3% in OPVs released by Toshiba is still lower than that of ∼15% in the commercial silicon photovoltaics, the continuing PCE growth in OPVs still is very optimistic.

Besides the advances on the PCE, lifetimes have also been extended thanks to state-of-the-art encapsulation technologies. Over 50% lifetime prolongation was observed in inverted OPVs and an extrapolated operation time of ∼18000 h corresponding to a light dose of ∼15 years of operation under ambient conditions outdoor was realized, which is closing to the norm lifetime of silicon photovoltaic cells. The promising robust inverted OPVs also exhibit advantages over the newly emerged perovskite hybrid solar cells given the intrinsically unstable organic–inorganic trihalide perovskite materials are extremely sensitive to moisture and heat. Moreover, the clean nature of OPVs also eliminates environmental and pollution concerns and ensures a sustainable employment. Longer lifetime OPVs are expected after deeper investigation on both scientific and technological aspects of device stability.
Another motif for commercializing the OPVs is their low processing cost. Although the recent development in silicon photovoltaic cells show a reduced cost, the low-temperature processability of inverted OPVs still reserve their potentials in the future energy market. By using roll-to-roll filming and electrode printing technologies, the cost may still be lowered further.
By taking consideration of environmental impact and developing prospect, inverted OPVs are promising candidates for the future solar market. To facilitate their industrialization, future research focus may still lie on answering the fundamental questions of the underlying photophysical process to help improving device structures as well as for better selection of materials, and also depend on a technical revolution on addressing challenges in large scale production such as very tightly controlling the BHJ morphology, deposing homogeneous nanometer-scale-thick films and developing accessory systems to maintain high device stability. In this way, accompanying the unique merits of OPVs such as lightness, their green nature, flexibility and easy-processing, the commercialization of inverted OPVs is hoped to be realized in the near future.
