In this study, a series of large-bandgap polymer donors comprising dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (fDTBT) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene units with or without sulfur/fluorine substitution in the side-chains are designed. It is found that the energy levels of these polymer donors can be linearly tuned due to the π-accepting properties of the sulfur atom and strong electron-withdrawing ability of the fluorine atom, while the absorption spectra keep nearly unchanged, which offers us the opportunity to balance the open-circuit voltage and charge separation driving force in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). The device performances of these polymer donors are validated by combining them with the polymer acceptor PJ1. The device results indicate that as the energy-level offsets are increased, these systems exhibit a more efficient charge transfer and lesser charge recombination, which afford remarkably improved short-circuit current density, fill factors, and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Eventually, high-efficiency binary all-PSCs with a maximum efficiency of 15.8% are obtained, which is the highest value reported so far for all-PSCs. Moreover, this system demonstrates superior performance for 1 cm2 all-PSC devices with a PCE of 14.4% and semitransparent all-PSC devices with a PCE of 10.3% (with average visible-light transmittance of 21.5%). Our study manifests that these fDTBT-based polymers are promising donor candidates for high-performance all-PSCs toward practical applications.

All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which use conjugated polymers as both an electron donor and acceptor, have been recognized as the most promising type of PSC for practical applications due to their unique advantages of superior thermal and mechanical stabilities over small-molecule acceptor (SMA)-based PSCs. Typically, the widely studied all-PSCs based on polymer acceptors comprising naphthalene diimide, perylene diimide, dicyanobenzothiadiazole, and B → N-bridged bipyridine moieties yield power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) below 12%, mainly due to the low absorption coefficient of polymer acceptors. In 2017, Zhang et al. proposed a strategy of polymerizing non-fullerene SMAs to construct novel polymer acceptors. The polymerized small-molecule acceptors (PSMAs) exhibited low bandgap and strong absorption inherited from the corresponding SMAs. Inspired by this strategy, many studies on designing PSMAs were carried out recently and great progress has been made in all-PSCs, with PCEs rapidly exceeding 14%. However, the state-of-the-art all-PSCs still lag far behind the non-fullerene SMA-based PSCs with a PCE over 17%.

In addition to polymer acceptors, the design and screening of polymer donors are equally important for achieving high-performance all-PSCs. For example, Gao et al. used a fluorinated donor, J51, to match with N2200 instead of its counterpart, J50, and the fabricated device demonstrated a much higher PCE of 8.27% compared with J50 (4.9%). Fan et al. demonstrated the use of PTzBI-Si with grafted siloxane-functionalized side chains in all-PSCs and the corresponding devices obtained a high PCE of 10.1%, which was higher than that obtained by PTzBI-based devices due to their improved charge carrier mobility, favorable face-on orientation, and high crystallinity. These results clearly demonstrate the necessity of developing suitable polymer donors to be paired with polymer acceptors, to improve the overall performance of all-PSCs. In addition, Li et al. reported a detailed comparison of all-PSCs based on the selection of both donor and acceptor polymers. The inverted all-PSCs based on PBDTTS-FTAZ:PNDI-T10 attained higher PCE than other donor–acceptor (D/A) combinations due to the combined merits of complementary absorption and fine tuning of the energy levels, which maximized the open-circuit voltage (VOC). Since VOC is strongly correlated with the difference between the donor highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and acceptor lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in PSCs, while a certain energy-level offset is often essential for efficient charge separation at the D/A interface, fine tuning the energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials by the modification of the chemical structure to simultaneously achieve high VOC and efficient charge separation in devices is always a hot topic in the PSC field.
In this study, we designed and synthesized three polymer donors composed of dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (fDTBT, which is a fused-ring acceptor unit successfully used in constructing polymer donors for high-efficiency fullerene- and NFSMA-based PSCs) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) motifs with or without sulfur and fluorine substitution in the side chains. The functionalized sulfur or fluorine substitutions endow these polymers with linearly varying energy levels with very similar bandgaps. Their photovoltaic performances were characterized by matching them with our recently reported high-performance PSMA PJ1. The charge separation and recombination, carrier transport, and morphology of these devices were systematically studied. It was found that all the devices exhibited a high VOC over 0.9 V. More importantly, by partly sacrificing the open-circuit voltage, these systems obtained more efficient charge transfer and lesser charge recombination, which afforded remarkably improved short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factors (FF), and PCE. Eventually, a highly efficient all-PSC based on JD40:PJ1 with a record efficiency of 15.8% was achieved. Moreover, this system also exhibited superior performance in 1 cm2 all-PSC devices (PCE of 14.4%) and semitransparent (ST) all-PSC devices (PCE of 10.3%), exhibiting great potential in preparing high-efficiency all-PSCs toward practical applications.

The routes for the syntheses of monomer and target polymers are depicted in Scheme S1. Compound 1 underwent a typical Stille cross-coupling reaction followed by a bromination reaction, affording monomer M1 in high yield. The target polymers JD40, JD40-S, and JD40-S-F were synthesized from M1 and three commercial BDT-based monomers by palladium (Pd)-mediated Stille coupling polycondensation. For comparison, polymer JD40-F (also known as D18 (ref. 41)) bearing the same backbone but a fluoro-substituted side-chain was also synthesized (Fig. 1a). The chemical structures of all target polymers were confirmed from the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (Fig. S1–S6). The obtained donor polymers could be readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. Moreover, these polymers possessed comparable number-average molecular weights (Mn) within 42.2–57.2 kDa (Fig. S7).

The ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the resulting polymers and PJ1 (later used in solar cell studies) in chloroform solutions and as thin films are, respectively, superimposed in Fig. S8 and 1b, with the corresponding data summarized in Table S1. In solution, the main absorption peaks of all polymer donors lay within 300–650 nm, with high absorption coefficients exceeding 8 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Furthermore, highly similar absorption profiles were observed for all polymer donor films. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of these target polymers were ∼1.91 eV, as estimated from the onsets of their thin films, which indicates that the sulfur and fluorine substitutions in the polymeric side-chain had negligible influence on the bandgaps. Note that PJ1 exhibits strong absorption in the near-infrared range of 600–900 nm, which well complements that of the target donors (Fig. 1b). Thus, the combinations of the target polymer donors and PJ1 were expected to offer high JSC in devices.
In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to estimate the energy levels of the resulting polymers and PJ1 under the same conditions. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.28/−3.32 eV for JD40, −5.38/−3.45 eV for JD40-S, −5.45/−3.58 eV for JD40-F, −5.58/−3.69 eV for JD40-S-F, and −5.61/−3.80 eV for PJ1 (Fig. S9 and Table S1). The energy-level diagrams of these materials are illustrated in Fig. 1c. We observed that polymer donors with sulfur and fluorine substitutions demonstrated synergistically deepened energy levels. This result was understandable since the sulfur atom possesses π-accepting ability due to both the pπ(C) orbital delocalizing into an anti-bonding orbital of the sulfur–carbon σ bond  (known as  negative hyperconjugation) and the formation of pπ(C)–dπ(S) orbital overlap where divalent sulfur accepts π-electrons from the π-orbital of the carbon–carbon double bond into its empty 3d-orbitals. Meanwhile, fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table, serves as an inductive (σ) “electron-withdrawing group” and therefore attracts π-electrons from the adjacent π-orbital of the aromatic ring. Thus, both the sulfur and fluorine substitutions substantially lowered the electron density of the conjugated polymer backbones through the thiophene connecting moieties and therefore reduced the energy levels of the polymer donors. For a qualitative illustration of the electronic difference caused by the sulfur or fluorine substitutions, simplified molecular models with two repeating units of the target donor polymers were selected and optimized with density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level using the Gaussian 16 suite of programs, which included Grimme's D3 dispersion correction with the BJ damping function. The optimized geometries in the side view and the obtained molecular orbitals for the simplified molecular models are shown in Fig. S10, where all molecular models display highly similar planar geometries; thus, the corresponding donor polymers were expected to exhibit superior charge-transporting properties. Moreover, the DFT calculations yielded the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the optimized geometries. From M(JD40) to M(JD40-S-F), concurrently reduced HOMO and LUMO energy levels were demonstrated, which agreed with the trend of the energy levels from the CV measurements. To further elucidate the electronic effects of relevant atoms, the atomic-dipole-moment-corrected Hirshfeld (ADCH) charges, calculated using the Multiwfn 3.3.9 program, were used to reflect the electronegativity. The negative ADCH charges indicated electron accumulation from other atoms. As shown in Fig. S11, more negative ADCH charges of the carbon atom (C74) in the M(JD40) model were observed than for those of side-chain sulfur and/or fluorine atoms in other three models. In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy was conducted to gain further insights into the HOMO levels for these polymer donors (Fig. S12). Gradually elevated ionization potentials (IPs) were observed from JD40 to JD40-S-F, which exhibited the same trend as that exhibited by the CV measurements and DFT calculations. The sulfur or fluorine substitutions in the polymeric side-chain resulted in concurrently down-shifted energy levels, which offers us the opportunity to establish a balance between high VOC and efficient charge separation in all-PSCs.
To probe the photovoltaic performance of these polymer donors, all-PSCs with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donors:PJ1/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag were fabricated, and a device with JD40-F as the donor was also studied for comparison. The details of the optimization processes for the active layers are listed in Tables S2–S11. The current density–voltage (J–V) plots and related photovoltaic parameters of the all-PSCs under the optimal processing conditions are shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, respectively. Firstly, the best device based on the JD40-F:PJ1 blend yielded a moderate PCE of 11.8% with a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 18.7 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65%, and exhibited a much lower performance than that exhibited by PSCs combined with the small-molecule non-fullerene acceptor Y6. The energy-level offsets (both ΔEHOMO(D–A) and ΔELUMO(D–A)) between the donor and acceptor are believed to provide the driving force for charge separation in PSCs. The low performance of JD40-F:PJ1 should be mainly due to the inefficient charge transfer between the donor and acceptor since the energy levels of JD40-F (e.g., HOMO of −5.45 eV) lie close to those of PJ1 (e.g., HOMO of −5.61 eV). When using JD40-S as a donor polymer, which has higher-lying energy levels, the best device achieved a slightly reduced VOC of 0.94 V, but a much higher JSC of 21.2 mA cm−2, an FF of 69%, and therefore, a higher PCE of 13.7%. In the case of JD40 with even larger energy offsets, the all-PSCs exhibited the highest PCE of 15.8%, with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 23.2 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75%, which are the highest values achieved for all-PSCs to date. From JD40-F to JD40, as the energy levels kept shifting up, VOC of the corresponding all-PSCs decreased slightly, but JSC and the FF concurrently increased, which corresponds to the significantly improved efficiencies. However, when both fluorine and sulfur substitutions were combined in the side-chains, the JD40-S-F-based devices showed a very poor efficiency of 1.3%, with a high VOC of 1.0 V, but a low JSC of 3.1 mA cm−2 and an FF of 43%, due to the insufficient driving force available for charge separation. Recently, Laquai et al. demonstrated that efficient exciton-to-charge-transfer state conversion at low ionization energy (IE) offsets can be prevented by the energy-level bending at the donor–NFA interface caused by the acceptors' quadrupole moments. Therefore, in most cases, sizable bulk IE offsets are required for efficient charge transfer and high internal quantum efficiencies. Our results reaffirm the critical role of energy-level offsets in promoting charge separation.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal all-PSCs are presented in Fig. 2b. All devices exhibited a similar photon response range of 300–900 nm, but remarkably discrepant intensity. For the JD40:PJ1-based devices, maximum EQE values of over 80% were recorded for both 450–550 and 700–800 nm ranges, suggesting balanced EQE contributions from the polymer donor JD40 (300–600 nm) and polymer acceptor PJ1 (600–900 nm). These high EQE values demonstrated a highly efficient photoelectron conversion process in the corresponding devices. However, the JD40-S:PJ1-, JD40-F:PJ1-, and JD40-S-F:PJ1-based devices demonstrated a substantially reduced photon response, implying low-efficiency photovoltaic conversion in the devices. The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra agreed well with those obtained from the J–V measurements, with deviations of less than 5% (Table 1).
To directly probe the charge-transfer efficiencies in the blend films, the photoluminescence spectra of the donors, PJ1, and their blend films were measured. As shown in Fig. 2c and S13, when using 560 and 760 nm light to selectively excite the donors and acceptor, the JD40-F:PJ1 blend film exhibited moderate D/A quenching efficiencies (83.7%/77.1%). As the energy levels were elevated, the JD40-S:PJ1-based blend film exhibited improved quenching efficiencies to a certain extent. High D/A quenching efficiencies (99.3%/94.2%) were observed in the JD40:PJ1 blend film, implying highly efficient electron and hole transfers between JD40 and PJ1. Meanwhile, the JD40-S-F:PJ1 blend film revealed substantially reduced D/A quenching efficiencies (52.5%/48.2%), which can be ascribed to the insufficient energy-level offset required for efficient charge separation. Overall, the considerably low charge-transfer efficiencies of JD40-S-F:PJ1, JD40-F:PJ1 and even JD40-S:PJ1 indicate that considerable excited-state recombination occurs through light emission before the charge transfer, which is considered to be the main reason for their relatively low performances.
In addition to the insufficient energy-level offsets, an unfavorable film morphology (e.g., too large donor or acceptor domains) may also lead to poor charge separation at the D/A interface. To understand whether the device morphologies were affected by these side-chains in our all-PSCs, the morphologies of the corresponding blend films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S14a–d, the AFM images of all blend films featured smooth surfaces with root-mean-square roughness values of less than 2 nm. The TEM images showed comparable nanoscale phase separation with no distinct difference (Fig. S14e–h). These results indicate that phase separation in these all-PSCs is not a limiting factor for charge separation. To gain insight into how these molecules are packed in pristine and blend films, two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering was performed. As shown in Fig. S15, both pristine JD40 and JD40-F films exhibited strong (100) diffraction peaks at ∼0.32 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicating the dominant edge-on orientations. However, in the pristine JD40-S and JD40-S-F films, the diffraction peaks were largely diminished, whereas a strong peak at ∼1.7 Å−1 was observed in the OOP direction, manifesting the preferable face-on orientations. Meanwhile, PJ1 also demonstrated a face-on orientation, as confirmed by the strong peaks at ∼1.65 Å−1 in the OOP direction. When these donor polymers were blended with PJ1, all blend films displayed an intensive π–π stacking (010) peak (∼1.70 Å−1) in the OOP direction and a laminar diffraction peak (100) (∼0.30 Å−1) in the in-plane direction, which indicates favorable face-on orientation in all devices (Fig. 3a–e). Note that the blend films based on JD40-S:PJ1 and JD40-S-F:PJ1 displayed slightly stronger (010) peaks in the OOP direction than those based on JD40:PJ1 and JD40-F:PJ1, which is possibly attributable to the stronger crystallization exhibited by the donors (JD40-S and JD40-S-F). The JD40:PJ1 blend film displayed a smaller π–π stacking spacing of 3.65 Å than JD40-S:PJ1 (3.72 Å), JD40-F:PJ1 (3.74 Å), and JD40-S-F:PJ1 (3.76 Å), suggesting slightly closer polymer π–π stacking in the JD40:PJ1 blend film. As the favorable molecule orientation in the blend film indeed facilitated charge transport and extraction, the carrier mobilities of the blend films were further investigated using the space-charge-limited current model. As shown in Fig. S16 and Table S12, all blend films exhibited high hole (μhs) and electron (μes) mobilities in the orders of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Note that the JD40:PJ1-based blend film exhibited a more balanced μh/μe, which agrees with the high JSC and FF values obtained for the device. Overall, the slight discrepancies in the blend morphologies should not be the limiting factor for device performance in our system and the distinctions in energy levels are considered the main reasons leading to the substantially improved photovoltaic parameters and PCEs from JD40-S-F:PJ1 to JD40:PJ1-based devices.
To further understand the charge separation probabilities of these real all-PSCs, the relation between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) of the devices is plotted in Fig. 4a. Here, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities of the devices under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied voltage bias. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) can be described as Jph/Jph,sat (Jph,sat, saturated photocurrent). As shown in Fig. 4a, in the cases of JD40-F:PJ1, JD40-S:PJ1, and JD40:PJ1, the photocurrent showed two primary regions: a linear increase region depending on Veff and a region in which Jph saturates quickly (Veff > 1 V). It can be observed that Jph,sat gradually increases from JD40-F:PJ1 to JD40:PJ1, which agreed well with charge transfer efficiencies in PL quenching tests. Moreover, these three devices yielded P(E,T) values of 84.6%, 91.5%, and 97.5%, respectively, under the short-circuit conditions, indicating gradually improved charge separation efficiencies, which also agreed well with the JSC tendency in the devices. However, in the case of JD40-S-F:PJ1-based devices, Jph exhibited a complex nonlinear relationship with Veff and did not saturate even with Veff > 3 V. The most probable explanation for this Jph–Veff relation in the JD40-S-F:PJ1 device is the separation of geminate electron–hole pairs, and/or the release of trapped charges assisted by a strong electric field; therefore, Jph increases at a higher effective voltage.
Besides the charge separation process, the charge recombination dynamics of different all-PSC devices were investigated by measuring JSC and VOCversus light intensity (Plight) characteristics. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be fitted to a simple relation JSC ∝ PlightS, where the superscript S indicates the degree of bimolecular recombination. In the absence of any bimolecular recombination in the blend active layer, S should be 1; otherwise, it should be smaller than 1. As shown in Fig. 4b, the S values for JD40-S-F:PJ1-, JD40-F:PJ1-, JD40-S:PJ1-, and JD40:PJ1-based devices were 0.877, 0.944, 0.966, and 0.993, respectively, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination was gradually reduced from JD40-S-F- to JD40-based devices. This result is in consistent with the FF and PCE values obtained for these devices. Meanwhile, VOCversus ln(Plight) characteristics are plotted in Fig. 4c. When the slope of VOCversus ln(Plight) is equal to 1 kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge), the dominant recombination mechanism is bimolecular recombination; otherwise, more monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination exists. As shown in Fig. 4c, a substantial decrease in the slope from 1.70 kT/q for JD40-S-F:PJ1 to 1.16 kT/q for JD40:PJ1 was observed, suggesting a substantially reduced monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination from JD40-S-F:PJ1- to JD40:PJ1-based devices.
The competition between recombination in the all-PSCs and carrier swept-out by the internal field was further explored by performing transient photocurrent measurements. The charge extraction times (τ) were calculated by nonlinearly fitting the curves of the photocurrent versus time. As shown in Fig. S17, the measured value of τ was 0.45 μs for JD40-F:PJ1, 0.42 μs for JD40-S:PJ1, and 0.28 μs for JD40:PJ1, all relatively higher than that of JD40-S-F:PJ1-based devices (0.6 μs), suggesting an improved charge extraction efficiency in their devices. Note that the inferior charge extraction rate observed for the JD40-S-F:PJ1-based devices compared to other analogue donor blend systems implies an increased charge recombination for the JD40-S-F:PJ1-based devices, which partly contributes to the low JSC and FF value in the devices.
Having established an outstanding demonstration of all-PSCs based on the JD40:PJ1 blend, we further investigated the dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the device area by enlarging the area from 0.04 to 1 cm2 (Fig. 5a). The demonstration of 1 cm2 solar cells is considered a critical and challenging step for up-scaling photovoltaic devices as electrical loss from the bottom indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, geometric loss induced by an increase in the cell width, and additional losses caused by film inhomogeneity and defects limit the overall performance of all-PSCs during enlargement of the active area. All-PSCs derived from JD40:PJ1 with an active area of 1 cm2 exhibited an impressive PCE of 14.4% with a VOC of 0.92 V, a JSC of 23.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68%. The 1 cm2 all-PSC device exhibited comparable JSC and VOC, but a lower FF with the small-area device, mainly due to both the increased resistance from the electrode and growing defects during the upscaling fabrication process. The device retained over 91% efficiency when its area was enlarged from 0.04 to 1.0 cm2, demonstrating its feasibility for application in large-area printed all-PSCs. In addition, the applicability of JD40:PJ1 in ST-all-PSCs was evaluated by varying the thickness of the Ag electrode. The transmittance spectra and corresponding J–V curves are illustrated in Fig. 5b and c. The PCEs of ST-all-PSCs were 12.4% for 16 nm Ag, 11.3% for 14 nm Ag, and 10.3% for 12 nm Ag electrodes. The average visible-light transmittances (AVTs) were 13.7%, 17.2%, and 21.5% for these ST-all-PSCs with 16 nm, 14 nm, and 12 nm Ag electrodes, respectively. The integrated JSC values calculated from the EQE curves were consistent with those obtained from the J–V tests (Fig. 5d). The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S13. To the best of our knowledge, our device is among the best-performing ST-all-PSCs with AVT exceeding 20%. The photographs of the ST-all-PSC devices with a 12 nm Ag electrode, which were placed in front of a scene, are presented in Fig. 5e. Compared to the reference photographs, the objects can be clearly observed through the ST-all-PSCs, further confirming the suitable transparency of the obtained ST-all-PSCs. The stability of the devices based on the champion combination (JD40:PJ1) was characterized. As shown in Fig. S18, the JD40:PJ1-based devices can retain over 85% of its initial efficiency after being annealed at 90 °C for 240 hour, demonstrating good thermal stability for future applications. Notably, the stability of the all-PSC device should be further improved by using more rigorous encapsulation.

In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a series of donor polymers, JD40, JD40-S, JD40-F, and JD40-S-F. These polymers exhibited highly similar absorption profiles, but tunable energy levels, due to their identical backbones and different functionalized side-chains. The photovoltaic performances of these polymer donors were validated by matching them with polymer acceptor PJ1. It was observed that by slightly elevating the energy levels of the polymer donors, more efficient charge transfer and lesser charge recombination were achieved, which afforded remarkably improved JSC and FF values for the relevant devices. Moreover, a favorable morphology and efficient charge transport were obtained for the blend films. Eventually, high-performance all-PSCs with a high PCE of 15.8% were achieved, which is the highest values obtained so far for all-PSCs. Moreover, based on the best performing combination, we demonstrated a highly efficient 1 cm2 all-PSC device (PCE of 14.4%) and an ST-all-PSC device (PCE of 10.3% with an AVT of 21.5%). Besides, JD40:PJ1-based devices can retain over 85% of their initial efficiency after being annealed at 90 °C for 240 hour, demonstrating good thermal stability for future applications. These findings reaffirm the critical role of energy-level offsets in promoting charge separation, and demonstrate that fDTBT is a promising building block to construct donor polymers for high-performance all-PSCs toward practical applications.
