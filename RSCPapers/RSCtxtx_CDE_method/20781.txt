In this study, by engineering ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) side chains we developed two novel low-bandgap copolymers, namely, PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS, for fabricating green solvent-processed but highly efficient non-fullerene organic solar cells (NF-PSCs). This molecular design strategy not only featured copolymers with excellent solubility in the green solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) but also introduced a low-lying HOMO level, a high extinction coefficient and high crystallinity. PTB-EDOTS-based binary blend NF-PSCs exhibited a PCE of 9.28% when ITIC-Th was used as the acceptor and chlorobenzene/1-chloronaphthalene (CB/CN) as the processing solvent. When MeTHF was used instead of CB/CN, the PCE was further increased to 10.18%. To compensate for the weak absorption in the short-wavelength region and further optimize the morphology, a polymer donor (J71) with a large bandgap was added as a third component to fabricate ternary blend NF-PSCs. After the addition of 20 wt% of J71, NF-PSCs exhibited improved absorption and fine-tuned morphology. Charge transport and energy transfer were also promoted by this ternary blend strategy via an electron cascade effect, a “hole back” phenomenon and a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, which increased the maximum PCE to 12.26% with a very high fill factor (FF) of 75.6%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance achieved by NF-PSCs using green solvents.

Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their advantages of low costs, light weight, mechanical flexibility and a high-throughput roll-to-roll fabrication process. As a result of continuous efforts in materials design and device processing techniques, significant progress has been made over recent decades. Recently, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged, which feature easily tunable energy levels, improved optical absorption and enhanced morphological stability, which provide opportunities to achieve higher device performance than that of traditional fullerene polymer solar cells (F-PSCs). Thus, a state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 14% has been achieved successfully in single-junction NFA-based polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs), which implies that they have a bright future for practical applications.

Despite considerable advances in the last few years, most efficient NF-PSCs have been dominated by the explosive growth of low-bandgap NFAs matched with medium- and wide-bandgap copolymer donors. In contrast, low-bandgap polymer donors, which had been shown to be superior during the period of F-PSCs, still lagged behind. Only a few low-bandgap polymers could maintain high device performance in NF-PSCs. BDT-TT-based copolymers that contain a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor (D) unit and a thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) acceptor (A) block are the most promising candidates. The rigid and large coplanar structures of the BDT and TT skeletons endow BDT-TT-based copolymers with a stabilized quinoidal structure, broad and strong absorption and high carrier mobilities. Among these, PTB7-Th has been the most successful example and has been widely used and studied in NF-PSCs. However, owing to the relatively high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (−5.27 eV), PTB7-Th-based PSCs exhibited a very low open-circuit voltage (Voc), which limited the final device performance. Fortunately, the energy levels could be tailored feasibly by manipulating the two-dimensional (2D) conjugated structure of the BDT skeleton, for example, by sulfurization or fluorination of the 2D side chains. Such side chain engineering could also have a positive effect on absorption abilities, crystallinities, carrier mobilities and blend morphologies. Therefore, the device performance could be impressively enhanced, but there is still much room for further improvement.
Most PSCs thus far have been fabricated using halogenated solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) or chloroform (CF) to guarantee solubility and halogenated solvent additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) to optimize the blend morphology. However, halogenated solvents and additives are detrimental to human health and the environment and are not suitable for environmentally friendly industrialization. Therefore, avoiding halogenated solvents in the device fabrication process has become an urgent task in the field of PSCs. Essentially, the solubility of the polymer donors is the initial and most critical obstacle that prevents the green solvent processability of PSCs. In this regard, several attempts have been made to solve this problem. The use of high-boiling-point solvents to process the active blends in hot solution conditions (hot spin-coating method) is a feasible strategy for improving the solubility and controlling the blend morphology. However, the hot spin-coating process is limited by the availability of very few suitable solvents and inevitably suffers from reproducibility issues and is not practically feasible for production by mass printing. Therefore, the development of polymer donor materials with improved solubility in green solvents is the key issue for addressing the above problem. Previous studies indicated that increasing the flexibility of alkyl side chains or reducing the molecular weight could conveniently improve the solubility of the resulting polymers but would sacrifice the ordered molecular packing arrangement, which would lead to lower absorption strength, inferior phase separation and poorer device performance. Alternatively, modifying the side chains with functional groups showed promising potential for improving the solubility, processability, intermolecular packing, and morphology of bulk heterojunction blend films, which also exhibited superior device performance to that of PSCs produced using halogenated solvents. Unfortunately, successful green solvent-processed PSCs still lag far behind. The production of environmentally friendly high-performance PSCs is still a great challenge but is also of great significance for future applications.
In this work, we report the design and synthesis of two novel BDT-TT-based copolymers (PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS, Scheme 1) by substituting a BDT block with ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) side chains, with the aim of achieving the green solvent processability of highly efficient NF-PSCs. The BDT-TT backbones endowed these copolymers with lower bandgaps of less than 1.57 eV. The EDOT side chains attached to the BDT skeleton significantly improved the solubility of the resulting copolymers in green solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF). By using ITIC-Th as the acceptor material, high-performance NF-PSCs based on these two copolymers were fabricated using the green solvent MeTHF and exhibited excellent phase separation and carrier mobilities, as well as high PCEs of up to 10.18%. On the other hand, ternary blend strategies have attracted tremendous attention recently. Ternary blends typically consist of either two donors and one acceptor (D1:D2:A) or one donor and two acceptors (D:A1:A2), which not only provide enhanced absorption coverage by using different materials with different absorption bands but also preserve the processing simplicity of a single-junction device. The tunable energy level and morphology provide further potential for the enhancement of photovoltaic performance. Considering that the device performance of PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th was still limited by the relatively low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) caused by the large absorption overlap and unoptimized blend morphology, the wide-bandgap copolymer J71 (ref. 39) was selected as the second donor material to fabricate ternary blend PSCs. After the addition of 20 wt% of J71, the resulting devices exhibited a greatly increased PCE of 12.26% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 18.25 mA cm−2 and an FF of 75.6%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance achieved by NF-PSCs using non-halogenated and aromatic-free processing solvents.

The synthetic routes of the monomers and copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. Compound 2a was synthesized by reacting EDOT (1) with 2-butyloctyl bromide in the presence of n-BuLi. Compound 2b was obtained by reacting EDOT (1) with sulfur powder and then 2-butyloctyl bromide in the presence of n-BuLi in a similar way to the synthetic procedure used for compound 2a. The treatment of compound 2a or 2b with n-BuLi and then 4,8-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione gave compound 3a or 3b, respectively, in good yields. Subsequently, compound 3a or 3b reacted with tri-n-butyltin chloride to produce monomer M1 or M2, respectively. The target copolymers, namely, PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS, were finally prepared by Stille coupling polymerization of M1 or M2 with M3. The detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data are provided in the Experimental section. Both copolymers exhibited high solubility not only in halogenated solvents such as CB, DCB and CF but also in the halogen-free solvents THF and MeTHF. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) was determined to be 28.7 and 31.5 kDa, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 2.2 and 2.4 for PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS, respectively, as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) was estimated to be 356 °C for PTB-EDOT and 326 °C for PTB-EDOTS, which indicated their high thermal stability (Fig. S1a). Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed no obvious endo- or exothermic peaks from room temperature to 250 °C (Fig. S1b), which was due to the rigid backbone, which limited the motion of chains.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of the copolymers in solution in CB and MeTHF (0.2 mg mL−1) and in the film state are shown in Fig. 1a and b. The solution of PTB-EDOT in MeTHF exhibited a dramatic red shift in absorption (∼26 nm) with a small shoulder peak in comparison with its solution in CB, which indicated greatly enhanced aggregation of the polymer in MeTHF. In addition, the absorption peak of PTB-EDOTS in solution in CB was red-shifted further than that of PTB-EDOT in MeTHF (633 vs. 624 nm) with an even more obvious absorption shoulder, which implied that the packing order of PTB-EDOTS was higher owing to the effect of sulfurization on the conjugated side chains. Moreover, when MeTHF was used instead of CB as the solvent, a further enhancement of the aggregation of PTB-EDOTS was observed together with a higher absorption peak shoulder, which indicated that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in PTB-EDOTS was improved significantly. On going from the solution state to the film state, the PTB-EDOT film cast from a CB solution exhibited a red shift from 598 nm to 615 nm in comparison with its counterpart in solution in CB, which implied that the packing property of the polymer improved in the film state. However, in comparison with a PTB7-Th film, the blue shift in absorption observed without any ICT transition peaks for PTB-EDOT indicated an extremely weak arrangement of the polymer in the solid state. This PTB-EDOT film exhibited a lower maximum absorption coefficient (k) of 5.7 × 104 cm−1 than that of PTB7-Th (8.6 × 104 cm−1). Fortunately, this could be circumvented by introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains and using MeTHF as the processing solvent. The PTB-EDOTS film cast from an MeTHF solution exhibited the largest red shift in absorption with the highest shoulder peak. The maximum absorption coefficient increased to 8.5 × 104 cm−1, which was comparable to that of PTB7-Th. On the other hand, when EDOT was introduced as the side chains the optical bandgap (Eoptg) shifted gradually to lower values of 1.57 and 1.55 eV for PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS, respectively, than that of PTB7-Th (1.59 eV). The optical parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were used to estimate the energy levels of the copolymers (Fig. 1c and Table 1). The energy levels of the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were estimated to be −5.33/−3.63 and −5.38/−3.69 eV for PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS, respectively, which corresponded to an electrochemical bandgap (ECVg) of 1.70 and 1.68 eV, respectively. In contrast, the HOMO/LUMO levels of PTB7-Th were −5.27/−3.55 eV with an ECVg of 1.72 eV. Although the EDOT groups could increase the electron-donating ability of BDT, the significantly enhanced intra- or intermolecular steric hindrance would also lower the HOMO levels. The lower HOMO level of PTB-EDOTS would have the potential to enable a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs. The energy level diagram of these copolymers and the ITIC-Th acceptor is plotted in Fig. 1d. The HOMO/LUMO levels of ITIC-Th were −5.66/−3.93 eV, which closely matched those of the above two copolymer donors.


The photovoltaic performance of the resulting copolymers processed using the mixed halogenated solvent CB/CN and the halogen-free solvent MeTHF was evaluated by using an inverted device structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/copolymer:ITIC-Th/MoO3/Al. The optimized blend ratio for the active layers was kept at 1:1.5 (w/w) with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in the CB/CN mixed solvent or 16 mg mL−1 in the MeTHF single solvent. Owing to the limited solubility of PTB7-Th in MeTHF, PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th-based devices were only fabricated with the CB/CN mixed solvent for comparison. The detailed device fabrication procedures are presented in the Experimental section. The J–V curves of the NF-PSCs are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

When CB/CN was used as the processing solvent, PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th control devices gave a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 16.01 mA cm−2, an FF of 68.2% and a PCE of 8.74%, which were comparable to previously reported results. In contrast, PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th devices fabricated from CB/CN gave a relatively lower PCE of 7.31% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 14.96 mA cm−2 and an FF of 58.9%. The slight increase in the Voc value was caused by the lowering of the HOMO level of PTB-EDOT on the introduction of EDOT as the side chains. However, the Jsc and FF values were reduced dramatically, which originated from the lower packing order of PTB-EDOT and inferior phase separation for charge diffusion and exciton dissociation (see below). When the CB/CN solvent was replaced by MeTHF, simultaneously increased values of Voc of 0.84 V, Jsc of 15.37 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.5% were easily achieved, which gave rise to an increased PCE of 8.59%. Although this device performance was still slightly lower than that of the PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th control devices, the PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th devices appeared promising, considering that only a single green solvent was used without any solvent additive. When an improvement in crystallinity was enabled by introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains, PTB-EDOTS devices processed using CB/CN displayed a much higher Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 15.78 mA cm−2, an FF of 67.6% and a PCE of 9.28%. It was interesting that a combination of side chain engineering and the effect of the processing solvent further enhanced the performance of PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th devices. A Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 16.25 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.2% were easily obtained when such devices were processed using a single green solvent, namely, MeTHF, which resulted in a champion PCE of 10.18%. The improved absorption and enhanced charge transport ability (see below) could be positive reasons for these improvements in photovoltaic parameters. The increased Jsc value was then confirmed by measurements of the external quantum efficiency (EQE). As shown in Fig. 2b, PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS devices exhibited slightly red-shifted EQE responses with respect to that of a PTB7-Th control device, which corresponded well with their absorption ranges. PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th devices processed using CB/CN exhibited the lowest EQE response, with a maximum value of 68%, because of poor absorption and exciton dissociation. When sulfur atoms were inserted into the side chains and MeTHF was used as a single solvent, PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th devices displayed a greatly improved EQE response of up to 73%. The values of the current density (JEQE) calculated from the corresponding EQE curves were very close to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurements (Table 2).

Because there was a large absorption overlap between the copolymer donor and the ITIC-Th acceptor (Fig. 3a), the device performance was limited by insufficient light harvesting in the shorter-wavelength region (300–550 nm, Fig. 2b). Hence, the large-bandgap copolymer donor J71 (Eoptg = 1.96 eV) was added to the binary PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th blend as an additional component to supplement the absorption in the short-wavelength range (Fig. 3a). J71:ITIC-Th devices were initially fabricated as control devices to assess the processability of MeTHF. A reasonable PCE of 10.29% was achieved with a high Voc of 0.93 V owing to the lower-lying HOMO level of −5.40 eV (Fig. 3b). The device performance was limited by the relatively low FF owing to the unfavorable phase separation (see below) caused by using MeTHF as the solvent, which resulted from the excessive aggregation of J71 in the low-solubility solvent. When a small amount of J71 was added to the PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th host blend, the solubility was not significantly affected, while the crystallinity of the blend film was further improved. When 20 wt% of J71 was added, the resulting ternary blend devices achieved a high Jsc of 18.02 mA cm−2 and an FF of 75.6% with a Voc of 0.90 V, which gave rise to a greatly increased PCE of 12.26% (Fig. 3c and Table 3). On a further increase in the content of J71, the device performance decreased gradually. Clearly, the EQE measurements showed that the variations in the spectral response were affected by the content of J71. The EQE response in the short-wavelength range (350–550 nm) was obviously enhanced when J71 was added step by step. However, the addition of excess J71 decreased the EQE response in the long-wavelength range. As shown in Fig. 3c and Table 3, the addition of 30 wt% of J71 achieved the highest Jsc value of 18.25 mA cm−2. However, the FF was reduced from 75.6% to 71.8%, which led to a lower PCE. Therefore, the balance between the Jsc and FF values in ternary blend devices achieved by incorporating 20 wt% of J71 contributed to the champion PCE of 12.26%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best performance achieved thus far by an NF-PSC processed using a non-halogenated aromatic-free solvent (Table S1).

To understand the differences in photovoltaic performance produced by side chain and device engineering, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on the related blend films (Fig. S2, S3 and 4). The PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th film displayed a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.54 nm with well-defined nanophase separation for efficient charge separation and transport. In contrast, the PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th film treated using CB/CN possessed a relatively smooth top surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.02 nm. No prominent phase separation was observed in either the AFM phase images or the TEM images. Therefore, this poor phase separation with excessively small domains would not be beneficial for charge diffusion in the related active blend. After MeTHF was used as the solvent, nanophase separation was promoted to some extent with a slightly increased RMS roughness of 1.24 nm. More highly ordered nanophase separation was observed in the PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th film treated using CB/CN and was further improved by using MeTHF as the solvent. The RMS roughness was 1.28 nm and 1.33 nm for PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th blends cast from CB/CN and MeTHF, respectively. In comparison with the grain-like domains in the PTB7-Th:ITIC-Th blend, the fibril-like net frameworks in the PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th blend could be expected to facilitate exciton dissociation and charge diffusion and thus give rise to a higher FF in PSCs. On the other hand, the J71:ITIC-Th binary blend exhibited an extremely rough top surface with a large RMS roughness of 3.31 nm together with large domains. This was caused by the strong aggregation of J71 during the deposition of the film, which would lead to an insufficient D/A interface for charge separation and a lower FF in the related devices. If a small amount of J71 was introduced into the optimized PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th binary blends, the phase separation could be fine-tuned. The TEM images clearly showed that the nanofibrils were enlarged with the addition of increasing amounts of J71, and the related AFM RMS values increased gradually to 1.35, 1.38 and 1.42 nm for the ternary blends that contained 10 wt%, 20 wt% and 30 wt% of J71. Finally, a content of 20 wt% of J71 enabled the ternary blend to adopt the best morphology for the diffusion and dissociation of excitons and thus contributed to the highest FF value of 75.6% in PSCs (Fig. 4).

Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) studies of the optimized binary and ternary blend films treated with MeTHF were then conducted to fundamentally understand the morphological evolution and the differences in device performance (Fig. 5 and Table 4). All the blend films exhibited well-defined diffraction peaks, which demonstrated their high crystallinity. The PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th blend exhibited an almost semicircular (100) diffraction in the in-plane (IP) direction with a lamellar stacking distance (dl) of 20.3 Å and a weak (010) diffraction in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction with a π–π stacking distance (dπ) of 1.70 Å, which implied weakly anisotropic packing. After the introduction of sulfur atoms into the side chains, significant enhancements in the (100) diffraction (dl = 19.6 Å) in the IP direction and the (010) diffraction in the OOP direction (dπ = 1.70 Å) were observed with a greater coherent length (LC), which implied that the crystallinity was higher and face-on packing was more preferred in PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th, which could be beneficial for better vertical charge transport in PSCs. In addition, an obvious (100) diffraction located at qz = 4.4 Å−1 originated from ITIC-Th and indicated a simultaneous improvement in the crystallinity of the acceptor in the PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th blend. Owing to the strong aggregation of J71, the J71:ITIC-Th blend exhibited a higher order of molecular packing with conspicuous (100), (200), (300) and (010) diffractions due to the copolymer (dl = 22.4 Å, dπ = 3.45 Å), as well as (100) and (200) diffractions due to the acceptor, which indicated the extremely highly ordered arrangement of J71:ITIC-Th. When 20 wt% of J71 was added to the PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th binary blend, significantly improved crystallinity with much more highly ordered molecular packing was achieved, together with the highest LC value. The dl (20.9 Å) and dπ (3.47 Å) values of the ternary blend were between those of the PTB-EDOTS and J71 binary blends without peak splitting, which implied the high miscibility of the two copolymer donors and the formation of a morphological alloy phase in the resulting ternary blend. The improved crystallinity and optimized phase separation of the ternary blends would favor the transport and separation of charge and thus give rise to enhanced device performance.

The charge carrier transport properties were investigated using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole- and electron-only devices were fabricated with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Au and Al/active layer/Al, respectively, to determine the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the corresponding blend films (Fig. S4 and S5 and Table S2). The PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th blend treated with CB/CN exhibited relatively low carrier mobilities (μh/μe = 0.87/2.01 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) because of the low crystallinity and weak phase separation. After MeTHF was used as the solvent, the hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.25/2.43 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1) increased. In comparison with its PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th counterpart, the PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th blend displayed much higher hole and electron mobilities of 1.63/3.05 × 104 and 2.35/3.56 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 when fabricated using CB/CN and MeTHF, respectively, owing to its higher crystallinity. As mentioned above, the crystallinity of the binary blends could be further improved by introducing a certain amount of J71 owing to its high aggregation tendency. After the addition of 20 wt% of J71, the resulting ternary blend films exhibited appropriately high and balanced charge carrier mobilities (μh/μe = 4.35/4.57 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 = 0.95), which contributed to a further increase in the Jsc and FF values in PSCs.

To get a further insight into the improvement of device performance achieved via the ternary blend strategy, the photoluminescence (PL) of pristine J71 and PTB-EDOTS films and PTB-EDOTS:J71 blends without the ITIC acceptor was measured (Fig. 6a). The PTB-EDOTS film exhibited very weak PL intensity with a small peak located at 800 nm, whereas J71 exhibited much stronger PL intensity with a maximum peak at 630 nm, which was located in the absorption range of PTB-EDOTS (Fig. 1). After J71 was blended with PTB-EDOTS, the peak at 630 nm disappeared with obvious quenching of PL intensity throughout the wavelength range, which indicated efficient Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from J71 to PTB-EDOTS. In addition, the reduced PL intensity around 800 nm originated from possible charge transfer between J71 and PTB-EDOTS. To clarify if there existed an efficient charge transfer process between these two copolymer donors, devices that used the pristine polymers or polymer blends without the acceptor as the active layers were fabricated and evaluated (Fig. 6b). The J–V curves of PTB-EDOTS:J71 devices indicated significantly increased Jsc and FF values in comparison with those of their PTB-EDOTS and J71 counterparts, which implied efficient charge transfer between PTB-EDOTS and J71 at the PTB-EDOTS:J71 interface. The lower LUMO level of PTB-EDOTS, which was situated between those of J71 and ITIC, could also enable an electron transfer cascade in the ternary blends. On the other hand, the slightly lower-lying HOMO of J71 would not induce a barrier to hole transfer in the ternary blends, which would ensure that holes could be transferred from PTB-EDOTS to J71 smoothly via a “hole back” transfer mechanism. By combining efficient charge transfer with FRET energy transfer, improved charge separation and reduced charge recombination could be expected and would enable better device performance.


To further identify the differences in performance caused by side chain and device engineering, the charge recombination dynamics were studied. The correlations between Voc, Jsc and the light intensity (Plight) were examined and plotted (Fig. 7a and b). The dependence of the Voc value on that of Plight for PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th processed using CB/CN and MeTHF was 1.57 and 1.42 kT/q, respectively, whereas it was 1.38 and 1.26 kT/q for PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th. The results indicated that trap-assisted recombination was reduced by introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains and using MeTHF as the solvent to improve the crystallinity and promote phase separation. This value was further lowered to 1.12 kT/q by incorporating J71 to fine-tune the morphology with much higher crystallinity and a reduction in morphological traps. The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed by the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Pαlight. The calculated value of α was 0.95 and 0.97 for PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th devices treated with CB/CN and MeTHF, respectively. The higher values of 0.98 and 0.99 calculated for PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th devices treated with CB/CN and MeTHF, respectively, indicated that bimolecular recombination was suppressed efficiently by introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains and using MeTHF as the solvent. The lowest level of bimolecular recombination was successfully achieved together with the highest α value of 0.998 by adding 20 wt% of J71 to the above PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th binary blends. As shown in Fig. 7c, the charge dissociation efficiency could be characterized by plots of Jphversus Veff. Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in the dark, respectively, and Veff is defined as V0–V, where V0 is the voltage at which JL = JD and V is the applied voltage. At a high reverse voltage (Veff > 2 V), the value of Jph reached saturation (Jsat), i.e., all the excitons were dissociated and charge carriers were collected by the corresponding electrodes owing to the high internal electric field. The value of Jph/Jsat was used to estimate the charge dissociation probability (PE,T), of which the corresponding values were determined to be 0.86 and 0.90 for PTB-EDOT:ITIC-Th devices treated with CB/CN and MeTHF, respectively, and 0.91 and 0.93 for PTB-EDOTS:ITIC-Th devices treated with CB/CN and MeTHF, respectively. In addition, the ternary blend device that contained 20 wt% J71 achieved the highest PE,T value of 0.95, which indicated that the highest charge dissociation efficiency was achieved in such devices, which contributed to the significant increase in the Jsc and FF values, as well as the best device performance.


In summary, we report the design and synthesis of two novel low-bandgap copolymers based on BDT and TT building blocks, namely, PTB-EDOT and PTB-EDOTS, with the aim of fabricating green solvent-processed but highly efficient NF-PSCs. In comparison with PTB7-Th, the EDOT side chains endowed the target copolymers with improved solubility and processability in a non-halogenated and aromatic-free solvent, such as MeTHF. PTB-EDOTS exhibited a lower-lying HOMO level, a higher extinction coefficient and improved crystallinity in comparison with PTB-EDOT, which gave rise to a higher PCE of 9.28% in binary blend NF-PSCs when ITIC-Th was used as the acceptor and CB/CN as a mixed solvent. When MeTHF was used instead of halogenated CB/CN, the PCE was further increased to 10.18% owing to the improved crystallinity and phase separation of the active layer. Moreover, by adding the wide-bandgap copolymer J71 with much higher crystallinity as a third component, the weak absorption of the above binary active layer in the short-wavelength region was compensated for and the blend morphology was further optimized. In addition, the addition of J71 promoted charge transport and energy transfer via an electron cascade effect, a “hole back” phenomenon and an FRET process. The device performance efficiency was finally increased to 12.26% with a very high FF of 75.6%. Our work provides a new concept of side chain engineering for the development of high-performance low-bandgap copolymer donors for fabricating highly efficient NF-PSCs processed using a non-halogenated aromatic-free solvent.
