For the purpose of synthesizing an electron donor polymer with a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and thus to achieve high open circuit voltage (VOC) of polymer solar cells, an indolocarbazole derivative, 3,8-bis-(4-octyl-thiophene-2-yl)-5,6-didodecyl-thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, was synthesized and used as a building block of a low bandgap alternating copolymer. An alternating copolymer, poly(3,8-bis-(4-octyl-thiophene-2-yl)-5,6-didodecyl-thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PTICThBT), was synthesized via the Suzuki coupling reaction, and the copolymer exhibited a deep HOMO level of −5.4 eV. When a blend of PTICThBT and PC71BM was used as an active layer in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells, a high VOC of 0.84 V was obtained with a power conversion efficiency of 2.62% under AM 1.5G condition.

Polymer solar cells based on conjugated polymers have intensively been investigated as a potential source of renewable electrical energy due to low cost, solution processability and flexibility. After years of intensive interdisciplinary research, some basic rules have become clear for designing an excellent p-type (or electron donor) material for photovoltaic application. First, the donor material should possess low optical bandgap (1.2–1.9 eV) in order to absorb photons as much as possible. Secondly, the material should have a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to afford high open circuit voltage (VOC) of the photovoltaic devices. Third, the material should have high charge carrier mobility for efficient charge transport to the electrode. However, there have been a few reports on developing conjugated polymers that fulfill all the requirements for high device performance of polymer solar cells.

Over the last decades, conjugated polymers based on carbazole derivatives have widely been used in organic electronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes and organic field-effect transistors, due to good charge transporting property which arises from the fully aromatic structure. As a chemical analogue to the carbazole unit, indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (IC) derivatives have emerged as a promising unit for synthesis of low bandgap alternating copolymers, because the extended conjugation length and the improved planarity of the IC unit provide better hole transporting property than carbazole-based polymers. Using IC derivatives, Tsai et al. reported a series of low bandgap alternating copolymers composed of IC and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or quinoxaline as an electron donor material in polymer solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the polymer–PCBM solar cells were in the range of 0.14–1.40%. This low efficiency mainly arises from the high-lying HOMO energy levels (−4.62 to −5.12 eV), which results in low VOC (0.35 to 0.67 V) of the device. Since the VOC of polymer solar cells is linearly proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the electron donating polymer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of electron accepting fullerene derivatives, development of conjugated polymers with a deep HOMO level is essential for achieving high VOC and thus better photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells.
Recently, it has been reported that the introduction of a fluorine or nitrogen atom onto a benzothiadiazole unit lowers the HOMO energy levels of the polymers. In this work, however, we prepared a low bandgap alternating copolymer based on a thiadiazole substituted IC derivative, thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, to more effectively lower the HOMO energy level of the corresponding polymer. Due to the strong electron-withdrawing property of the thiadiazole group, the fusion of the thiadiazole group onto IC can reduce the electron density of the IC unit, which lowers the HOMO level of the IC unit and consequently that of the corresponding copolymer.

All reagents were obtained from Aldrich, Acros, and TCI Chemical Co., and used as received. All the solvents were purified under nitrogen and distilled before use. Thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole was synthesized according to the literature.

In a 100 ml round bottom flask, compound 5 (280.1 mg, 0.2 mmol) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) (90.7 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of toluene (40 ml) and aqueous K2CO3 solution (2 M, 4.6 ml). The solution was flushed with N2 for 20 min, and then 17.3 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 48 hours. After being cooled to room temperature, the resulting mixture was poured into methanol. The crude product was filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, and then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, acetone, and chloroform. The polymer was recovered from the chloroform fraction, and precipitated into methanol to afford the product as a dark red solid. Yield: 120 mg (50%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.78 (d, J = 7.56 Hz, 2H, Ar–H), 7.92 (s, 2H, Ar–H), 7.85 (m, 4H, Ar–H), 7.50 (s, 2H, Ar–H), 4.70 (t, 4H, N–CH2). Number-average molecular weight (Mn) = 13000 g mol−1 (polydispersity index = 1.3).


The chemical structures of the materials used in this study were identified by 1H NMR (Avance DPX-300). Mass analysis was performed on a JEOL, JMS-600W mass analyzer. Molecular weight and its distribution were measured by gel permeation chromatography (Waters) equipped with a Waters 2414 refractive index detector using THF as an eluent, where the columns were calibrated against standard polystyrene samples. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was carried out on a TA Instruments 2910 Modulated DSC (DuPont). The sample was heated and cooled from 20 to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded with an M18XHF-SRA diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation. The optical absorption spectra were obtained by an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out on a potentiostat/galvanostat (VMP 3, Biologic) in an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in dichloromethane. Platinum wires (Bioanalytical System Inc.) were used as both counter and working electrodes and silver/silver ion (Ag in a 0.1 M AgNO3 solution, Bioanalytical System Inc.) were used as a reference electrode.


Polymer solar cells were fabricated on ITO glass cleaned by stepwise sonication in acetone and IPA, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 120 °C for 30 min to form a 40 nm thick film. A mixture of polymer and PC71BM was dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene (20 mg ml−1), and spin-coated on top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS film at 1000–1200 rpm for 60 s. The typical thickness of the active layer was 80–90 nm. Lithium fluoride (1 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were evaporated under a vacuum lower than 10−6 Torr on top of the active layer through a shadow mask. The effective area of the cell was ca. 4 mm2.


The photovoltaic performance was measured under nitrogen atmosphere inside the glove box. The current density−voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 4200 source-meter under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by a Newport-Oriel solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a NREL certified photodiode and light source meter prior to each measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Polaronix K3100 IPCE measurement system (McScience). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si cell.


The synthetic route for a new IC derivative and its copolymer is shown in Scheme 1. To assure solubility in organic solvents, compound 1 was reacted with dodecyl iodide under basic conditions to afford alkylated thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (2). Bromination of compound 2 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) yielded compound 3. It is generally known that the para position of the nitrogen atom is brominated when carbazole is reacted with NBS. But, in our study, the meta position of thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole was brominated with NBS. When the chemical shifts in the proton NMR spectrum of compound 3 [8.61 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.80 (d, J = 1.5 Hz, 2H), 7.58 (dd, J = 1.5 Hz, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H)] are compared with those of 2,7-dibromo-carbazole and chlorinated thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, they show the same splits and coupling constants (Fig. 1).

3-Octylthiophene was attached to both sides of compound 3via the Stille coupling, followed by bromination with NBS to afford the final monomer (compound 5).
2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) was coupled with compound 5via the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction to produce an alternating copolymer, PTICThBT. The polymer synthesized in this study is highly soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The number average molecular weight of the polymer was 13000 g mol−1 with a polydispersity index of 1.3.
The absorption spectra of the polymer in chloroform solution and the thin film are shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption spectrum of the polymer in the chloroform solution shows two absorption bands at 350 nm and 470 nm, while the absorption spectra of the thin film are largely red-shifted, indicating that the polymer chains are highly aggregated in the solid state. The optical bandgap, as determined from the onset of the absorption spectra of the polymers, is 1.77 eV. The absorption peak at a shorter wavelength is attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, while the absorption peak at a longer wavelength corresponds to the intramolecular charge transfer from the electron-rich thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole to the electron-deficient 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit.
The electrochemical property of the polymer is obtained from the oxidation and reduction cyclic voltammogram, as shown in Fig. 2b. The estimated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer are −5.4 eV and −3.3 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that the HOMO level of the polymer synthesized in this study is significantly lower than those of other IC-based polymers (−4.62 to −5.18 eV). The deeper HOMO level of our polymer can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing thiadiazole group substituted into the IC unit which reduces the electron density of IC and thereby increases the work function of the polymer. The low-lying HOMO level of the polymer is expected to generate high VOC of polymer solar cells and thus to exhibit better photovoltaic performance than other IC-based devices. Judging from the electrochemical characteristics, it is considered that the polymer synthesized in this study is a potential donor material for photovoltaic application.
The thermal properties of the polymer were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both melting and crystallization peaks of the polymer were observed, as shown in Fig. 3a. The rigid thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole unit in the alternating copolymer is expected to induce molecular ordering of the polymer chains to some extent, like polyindolo[3,2-b]carbazoles which were reported to have a highly ordered molecular structure.
When the molecular ordering of our polymer was further examined by XRD, the polymer showed two diffraction peaks at around 4.5° and 21.9°, as shown in Fig. 3b. The weak diffraction peak at 4.5° is assigned to the interchain spacing between polymer chains, where alkyl side groups are expected to self-organize in an interdigitated manner. The broad peak at 21.9°, corresponding to the distance of 4.05 Å, originates from the π–π stacking of aromatic groups in the polymer chain. Although the interchain distance and stacking distance of the polymer are very close to those of polyindolo[3,2-b]carbazoles, the peak intensity of our polymer is relatively weak, because large solubilizing side groups in the polymer may prevent molecular packing.
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a layered configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTICThBT:PC71BM/Al. The J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices prepared from PTICThBT:PC71BM blends using chlorobenzene as a processing solvent are represented in Fig. 4a, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It should be noted here that the VOCs of all the devices (0.81–0.84 V) are considerably higher than those of other IC-based devices (0.35–0.67 V), which arises from the deep HOMO energy level of our polymer. The device of PTICThBT:PC71BM exhibits a PCE of 1.47% at the blend ratio of 1:2 (PTICThBT:PC71BM, w/w). The low efficiency of the device is mainly because of the low values of fill factor (FF) and short circuit current density (JSC). For further device optimization, a thin layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) was introduced between the active layer and the cathode as an exciton blocking layer. It has previously been reported that the insertion of an LiF interlayer leads to creation of a dipole at the interface, leading to a decreased energy barrier at the photoactive layer/cathode interface and hence improved charge extraction across the interface. As a result, the introduction of a 1 nm LiF layer increased JSC and FF values with an enhanced PCE of 2.62%.

The external quantum efficiency of the devices under monochromatic light is shown in Fig. 4b. The range of spectral response of the device is in good agreement with the absorption spectrum of the polymer (Fig. 2a).
The charge carrier mobility of the polymer was measured from the space charge limited current J–V curves as obtained in the dark using hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au) (Fig. 5). According to the Mott–Gurney equation the hole mobility of the polymer:PC71BM (1:2 by weight) blend film was calculated to be 9.11 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. This moderate value of hole mobility may be ascribed to relatively low molecular weight of the polymer and large side chains in the repeat unit, which may prevent effective packing of polymer chains.

We report the synthesis and characterization of a new class of low bandgap alternating copolymers (PTICThBT) composed of an IC derivative, thiadiazolo-indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units. The fusion of the electron-withdrawing thiadiazole group onto the IC unit in the copolymer was proven to effectively lower the HOMO level of the copolymer. The photovoltaic device from the blend of PTICThBT and PC71BM exhibits a PCE of 2.62% with a high VOC of 0.84 V. Further device optimization such as interface engineering between active layer and cathode, and control of film morphology by using an additive may be needed to improve further the device performance.
