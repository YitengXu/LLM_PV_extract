A p–i–n organic photovoltaic cell with tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP), a BP–C60 dyad and PCBM for the p-, i- and n-layers, respectively, gave a better fill factor and power conversion efficiency than the corresponding p–i–n cell having a 1:1 blend film of BP and PCBM as the i-layer.

Solution-processed organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have been attracting much attention, and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 8% have been attained in small-molecular bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices. One of the requirements in order to achieve such high PCEs is the balanced formation of a large donor–acceptor (D–A) interface and directional charge-carrier paths within the organic active layer; however, it is usually difficult to obtain an ideal film morphology through simple solution-deposition techniques.

D–A dyads have been widely studied to understand charge separation and recombination processes between donor and acceptor units. In addition, various dyad compounds have been examined for use as active materials in BHJ OPVs, since direct connection of donor and acceptor components can be beneficial for forming a maximal D–A interface within a film, thereby providing high charge-separation efficiency. On the other hand, no p–i–n-type device with a D–A dyad has been reported as far as we know, although the employment of the p–i–n structure may lead to enhanced efficiencies.
Tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) is one of the superior p-type organic semiconductors. Although BP is not soluble in common organic solvents, thin films of BP can be prepared via solution-based deposition techniques by employing a soluble, thermo-labile precursor, bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene(BCOD)-fused porphyrin (CP). Specifically, a BP film can be prepared by depositing CP by spin-coating then heating the resulting film at around 180 °C to induce the in situ conversion of CP to BP. This methodology enabled preparation of solution-processed organic field-effect transistors and OPVs based on nano-crystalline BP films.
With these in mind, we expected that D–A dyads having BP as a donor would allow us to systematically investigate the effect of covalent linkage between donor and acceptor units in solution-processed BHJ or p–i–n devices. In this report, we will present the synthesis of a dyad consisting of BP and C60 units (BP–C60), as well as its soluble precursor (CP–C60). The linker of BP–C60 is flexible to ensure the solubility of CP–C60 as shown in Fig. 1. We also compare the photovoltaic performances of BP–C60 films with those of 1:1 blend films of BP and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in p–i–n or BHJ OPVs. Here, each p–i–n active layer has a configuration of [BP/BP–C60/PCBM] or [BP/BP:PCBM(1:1)/PCBM].
The synthetic route to CP–C60 is shown in Scheme S1, ESI. An acid-catalyzed condensation of BCOD-α-free dipyrrylmethane,n-pentanal, and 4-methoxycarbonylpentan-1-al was performed, followed by oxidation with p-chloranil. After insertion of the zinc ion, the zinc porphyrin monoester was obtained in 22% yield. Reduction of the monoester to the corresponding alcohol by LiAlH4 (76% yield) and then coupling with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (64% yield) gave zinc–CP–C60. Zinc–CP–C60 was treated with trifluoroacetic acid to afford free-base CP–C60 in 86% yield. BuCP was also prepared from BCOD-α-free dipyrrylmethane and n-pentanal in 42% yield as a precursor of the reference compound 5,15-dibutylbenzoporphyrin (BuBP). In TGA analyses, weight loss started at around 150 °C and ended at around 200 °C for both CP–C60 and BuCP. The decreased weights corresponded well to four ethylene units per molecule (Fig. S2 and S4, ESI).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of CP–C60 and BP–C60 in CH2Cl2 are shown in Fig. 2a. The spectrum of BP–C60 has peaks at 442, 573, 614 and 671 nm, which are red-shifted compared to the corresponding peaks of CP–C60 at 420, 512, 542 and 579 nm. The spectrum of CP–C60 is compared to that of a 1:1 mixture of BuCP and PCBM as shown in Fig. S6, ESI. The Soret peak of CP–C60 (420 nm) is red-shifted by 10 nm from that of BuCP (410 nm) and broadened. The spectrum of CP–C60 does not show the concentration dependency; thus, the intramolecular interaction between the CP and C60 units might be the cause of the red shift and broadening. Similarly, the spectrum of BP–C60 showed the broadening and red shift of the Soret band compared to the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of BuBP and PCBM as shown in Fig. S7, ESI. Fluorescence of CP–C60 and BP–C60 is quenched drastically compared to BuCP and BuBP as shown in Fig. S8 and S9, ESI. The fluorescence quantum yields of CP–C60, BuCP, BP–C60 and BuBP were 0.36, 3.1, 1.1 and 11.3%, respectively. This observation again suggests the existence of intramolecular interaction for the dyads in solution, where the C60 moiety can effectively quench the fluorescence from the porphyrin moiety through the photoinduced electron transfer. This interaction must be enabled by the flexibility of the linkage.
The absorption spectra of CP–C60 and BP–C60 films are also shown in Fig. 2a. The film of BP–C60 shows broader peaks compared to those seen in CH2Cl2. The normalized absorption spectrum of BP–C60 film is also compared with those of BP, PCBM, and the 1:1-blend films (Fig. S10, ESI). The BP film shows a strong Q band at 690 nm, which is typical for crystalline BP films. On the other hand, the shape of the Q band of BP–C60 film indicates that BP units are not effectively stacked with each other within the film. The spectrum of blend film has a larger peak at 690 nm and a broader peak at around 640 nm as compared to the BP–C60 film, suggesting partial stacking of BP units. The Soret peak of the blend film is also broadened compared to the BP–C60 and BP film. The experimentally determined optical band gap (Egap) and frontier-orbital energies of BP–C60 are summarized in Table S1, ESI, with those of BP and PCBM films (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI). Comparison of these values shows that the difference between the LUMO of PCBM as measured by cyclic voltammetry and the HOMO of BP as measured by photoemission yield spectroscopy is the same as the HOMO–LUMO difference in the BP–C60 dyad using the same methods to calculate the HOMO and the LUMO.
Schematic descriptions of the BHJ and p–i–n devices are shown in Fig. 2b. The deposition process of organic active layers is summarized in Fig. S1, ESI, and detailed in the experimental section in ESI. The BHJ (BP–C60) device has a BP–C60 active layer, which was prepared by spin-coating of a CP–C60 solution followed by heating at 160 °C for 20 min. BHJ (BP:PCBM) has a 1:1 blend film of BP and PCBM deposited similarly from a mixed solution of CP and PCBM. The p–i–n (BP–C60) film was prepared by sequential deposition of BP, BP–C60 and PCBM as p-, i-, and n-layers, respectively. The p–i–n (BP:PCBM) device has a 1:1 mixture film of BP and PCBM in the i-layer instead of BP–C60.
The J–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 2c, and the device performances are summarized in Table 1. The dark currents are plotted in Fig. S13, ESI. The BHJ (BP–C60) device showed a better performance (PCE = 0.15%) with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 1.12 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.45 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.29 compared to the BHJ (BP:PCBM) device (JSC = 0.57 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.14 V, FF = 0.23, PCE = 0.02%). Although the BHJ (BP–C60) device is better than the BHJ (BP:PCBM), the dark J–V characteristics of both devices show current leakage (Fig. S13, ESI). The performance of p–i–n (BP–C60) and p–i–n (BP:PCBM) is much improved; JSC = 5.18 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.62 V, FF = 0.61 and PCE = 1.98% for p–i–n (BP–C60) and JSC = 5.92 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.59 V, FF = 0.46, and PCE = 1.63% for p–i–n (BP:PCBM). The highest FF of p–i–n (BP–C60) is associated with the lowest series resistance (Rs) and the highest shunt resistance (Rsh), which suggests the best semiconducting properties of the p–i–n (BP–C60) device among those examined here. Fig. 2d shows external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices. The better EQE of BHJ (BP–C60) than BHJ (BP:C60) suggests that the carrier generation in the dyad film is more effective than in BHJ (BP:PCBM). The spectrum of BHJ (BP–C60) shows two peaks at 350 and 440 nm corresponding to C60 and BP, respectively, which indicates that both units work as sensitizers. The broader, less defined peaks in the EQE spectrum of BHJ (BP:PCBM) could be attributed to the stacking of BP molecules in the blend films—a similar tendency was observed between the UV-vis absorption spectra of these films (Fig. S10, ESI). The EQEs of the p–i–n (BP–C60) and p–i–n (BP:PCBM) are much enhanced as compared to the BHJ devices. The peak at 350 nm for p–i–n (BP–C60) is lower than that for p–i–n (BP:PCBM), thus the C60 moieties do not work effectively as sensitizers in the former device. This seems to reflect the relatively low absorption at this wavelength in the film of BP–C60 (Fig. S10, ESI), although the reason for the low absorptivity is not clear at this moment.

The tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and phase images of a BP–C60 film and a 1:1 blend film of BP and PCBM are shown in Fig. 3. The two films are similar in surface roughness, with the RMS values of 0.43 and 0.50 nm for the dyad and blend films, respectively. On the other hand, the phase images showed an obvious difference: the dyad film has a smooth surface, but the blend film shows large grains of 1–2 μm diameters. In addition, a dyad film formed on a BP layer showed a much smoother surface with fewer grains as compared to a corresponding blend film on BP (Fig. S14 and S15, ESI). Thus, the covalent linkage between the BP and C60 units prevents the formation of grains, which may have led to the improvement of the FF. The out-of-plane XRD patterns, on the other hand, did not show the specific peaks for both the dyad and blend films as shown in Fig. S16, ESI. The crystallinity of BP and PCBM in these films is not so high, although large grains are observed in the AFM phase image of p–i–n (BP:PCBM) and the Q band of the blend film suggested the partial π–π interaction of BP in the blend film.
In summary, we were successful in constructing the p–i–n OPV device composed of BP, BP–C60, and PCBM for p-, i-, and n-layers, respectively, using the in situ thermal conversion from solution-deposited CP and CP–C60 to insoluble BP and BP–C60. The BP–C60 film showed better performance in a p–i–n device associated with a higher FF compared to the 1:1 blend film of BP and PCBM. The grain boundaries in the blend film could have increased the resistance in the film and therefore lowered the FF values. In contrast, the BP–C60 dyad did not form grains and the resultant p–i–n device showed lower series resistances than the corresponding device based on the blend film. In order to further improve the OPV performance with D–A dyads, higher JSC values should be attained through the improvement of electron-transfer efficiency and the suppression of charge recombination. Synthesis of D–A compounds of the next generation is underway.
