Photon harvesting and phase separation can be synergistically optimized by using ternary strategy with appropriate DIB-SQ-doped Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM as active layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ternary organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) exhibits an increasing and then decreasing trend dependent on the increase in DIB-SQ doping ratio. The PCE of OPVs was increased from 5.52% to 6.18% by doping 3 wt% DIB-SQ while keeping the donor/acceptor doping weight ratio at 1:1.5. The PCE improvement can be attributed to the better trade-off between photon harvesting and phase separation in the ternary active layers. The degree of phase separation strongly influences energy or charge transfer between donors and charge transport in the ternary active layers. The dynamic process between donors was investigated according to J–V curves of cells without acceptor under light illumination. Experimental results fully confirm that this ternary strategy should have a brilliant future due to about 12% PCE improvement compared with Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM-based binary OPVs.

During the past years, rapid development of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) has been achieved with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) increased from 5% in 2005 to 11.7% in 2015. As we know, the performance of OPVs is codetermined by photon harvesting, exciton utilization and charge collection efficiency dependent on the materials used and the fabrication technology of active and interfacial layers. To enhance photon harvesting by the active layers, many effective approaches have been applied by exploiting new donor materials and non-fullerene acceptor materials, developing tandem, inverted or ternary cells, and managing incident light within the active layer by aperiodic nanostructures. To improve exciton utilization efficiency, the typical strategies are summarized as follows: (i) optimizing the phase separation of active layers to enlarge the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface area for better exciton dissociation, keeping bi-continuous charge transport channels, and (ii) adopting an interfacial layer for efficient charge collection by the individual electrode. Exciton utilization and charge transport efficiency should play a crucial role in determining OPV performance, which is very sensitive to D/A phase separation of the active layers. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously increase photon harvesting and optimize D/A phase separation by a simple method.

Ternary strategy is emerging as an attractive method to simultaneously optimize photon harvesting and phase separation while retaining a simple fabrication technology. For ternary OPVs with two donors, donors usually have different band gaps to cover the broad solar light range for optimal photon harvesting, and the absorption coefficient of materials used is one of the key parameters to be considered in enhancing photon harvesting by ternary OPVs. The dynamic process between two donors can be divided into two categories: intermolecular interaction or independent. Intermolecular charge transfer or energy transfer may be beneficial to improving exciton utilization efficiency. Spectral overlap between the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of one donor and the absorption spectrum of the other is the prerequisite for energy transfer between donors; intermolecular energy transfer efficiency is codetermined by the PL emission intensity of one donor, the absorption coefficient of the other, and their intermolecular distance. The intermolecular charge transfer results in the decreased PL emission intensity of both donors, which may be similar to exciton dissociation at D/A interfaces. The two donors independently work with acceptors in active layers and form individual hole transport channels, named parallel-linkage structures. Similar chemical structure of the two donors, with good miscibility, is also needed to form appropriate phase separation in ternary active layers. Two independent sub-cells are electrically decoupled, with the total performance of ternary OPVs codetermined by the contribution of the independent sub-cells.
Recently, Zhan et al. reported the highest PCE in ternary OPVs with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) as double acceptors; the working mechanism of two acceptors is attributed to the “alloy” state of the acceptors and the enhanced photon harvesting by ternary active layers.
In this work, the narrow band gap polymer poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5′-diyl] (Si-PCPDTBT) with high hole mobility and PC71BM were selected as donor and acceptor materials, respectively. Yang et al. firstly reported Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM-based cells exhibiting a PCE of 5.1% and then an improved PCE of 5.6%. The small molecule 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl]squaraine (DIB-SQ) was selected as the second donor due to its high absorption coefficient, which can also supplement photon harvesting of Si-PCPDTBT in the spectral range of 600 nm to 700 nm. More than two hundred binary or ternary OPVs were fabricated to investigate the impact of DIB-SQ doping ratios on the performance of ternary OPVs. The leading PCE of ternary OPVs was increased to 6.18% by doping 3 wt% DIB-SQ in donors. The PCE improvement was attributed to the synergistically enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). To give more solid evidence for the ternary strategy in the performance improvement of OPVs, typical research works on Si-PCPDTBT based binary or ternary OPVs are summarized in the Table 1. It is worth noting that the reported PCE of 5.52% in this work should be among the highest values for Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM-based OPVs. About 12% PCE improvement was obtained by doping an appropriate amount of DIB-SQ based on the same fabrication conditions. The underlying reasons for the performance improvement of ternary OPVs will be fully discussed in terms of enhancing photon harvesting and optimizing phase separation.

The materials Si-PCPDTBT, DIB-SQ and PC71BM were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. The mixed DIB-SQ:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt/wt) and Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt/wt) powder were respectively dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) to prepare 25 mg ml−1 binary blend solutions. Ternary blend solutions of Si-PCPDTBT1−x:DIB-SQx:PC71BM1.5 (x = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 wt%, x represents DIB-SQ doping weight ratios in donors) were prepared by mixing binary solutions at different volume ratios. The prepared blend solutions were continuously heated and stirred at 100 °C for 12 hours. The conjugated polyelectrolyte poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was dissolved in methanol with the addition of 0.25 vol% acetic acid to prepare 0.2 mg ml−1 solution. The substrates, coated indium tin oxide (ITO) with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω square−1, were sequentially pre-cleaned in ultrasonic baths containing detergent, deionized water and ethanol, respectively. The cleaned ITO substrates were baked at 100 °C for 10 minutes in ambient condition and then treated by oxygen plasma for 60 s to improve their work function and clearance. Subsequently, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, purchased from H. C. Starck Co. Ltd) solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 5000 rounds per minute (rpm) for 40 s and baked at 120 °C for 15 minutes. Then, the ITO substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS films were transferred to a high-purity, nitrogen-filled glove box. To fabricate high-quality active layers, all blend solutions and substrates were continuously heated on a hot plate at 100 °C until spin-coating of active layers, which is beneficial to the formation of appropriate D/A phase separation. The hot solutions were spin-coated onto the preheated PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates at 1200 rpm for 60 s. All the pristine active layers were quickly placed in a covered Petri dish filled with chloroform (CHCl3) vapor to undergo 20 minutes vapor annealing treatment; the vertical phase separation may be further optimized during vapor annealing treatment. After that, PFN solution was spin-coated onto the active layers at 3000 rpm for 40 s to prepare an ultrathin interfacial layer. Then, 100 nm Al was deposited onto the PFN interfacial layer with a shadow mask by thermal evaporation under 3 × 10−4 Pa pressure; the thickness was monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance. The effective area of cells is about 3.8 mm2, which is defined by the vertical overlap of the ITO anode and Al cathode. For DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based binary OPVs, the mixed DIB-SQ:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt/wt) powder was dissolved in CHCl3 to prepare 25 mg ml−1 blend solution to obtain better blend films. The chemical structures of the materials used and the schematic diagram of the device configuration are exhibited in Fig. 1.

The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the OPVs were measured in the dark and under light illumination using a Keithley 4200 source meter in ambient condition. The AM 1.5G irradiation was generated by an ABET Sun 2000 solar simulator with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OPVs were measured by a Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100. The absorption spectra of films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrometer. PL spectra of films were measured by a HORIBA Fluorolog®-3 spectrofluorometer system. The thickness of active layers is about 100 nm, as measured by the Ambios Technology XP-2 Stylus Profiler. The morphology of blend films was characterized using an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a multimode Nanoscope IIIa operated in tapping mode.

The absorption spectra of neat Si-PCPDTBT, DIB-SQ and PC71BM films were measured and are exhibited in Fig. 2a. The absorption spectrum of Si-PCPDTBT exhibits two relatively strong absorption peaks at about 700 nm and 766 nm, as well as one relatively weak absorption peak at about 430 nm. DIB-SQ has a broad absorption range from about 550 nm to 750 nm, with one absorption peak at about 693 nm. Meanwhile, PC71BM shows a strong and broad absorption in the UV-vis light range. It is obvious that there is apparent absorption spectral complementary between DIB-SQ and Si-PCPDTBT in the spectral range of 550 nm to 800 nm. DIB-SQ has relatively high absorption coefficient, which is beneficial to enhancing the photon harvesting of ternary active layers. The absorption spectra of ternary active layers with different DIB-SQ doping ratios were measured and are exhibited in Fig. 2b. It is apparent that the relative intensity of the two absorption peaks at the longer wavelengths strongly depends on DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors. Therefore, photon harvesting of ternary active layers may be maximized by adjusting DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors.

The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of all OPVs were measured under AM 1.5G irradiation with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are exhibited in Fig. 3a. It is apparent that Jsc and FF were increased and then decreased along with DIB-SQ doping ratio increase. The improvements may be attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting and the optimized phase separation for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the ternary active layer. However, the Jsc and FF of ternary OPVs were decreased by doping more DIB-SQ in donors, which may be mainly due to the disrupted D/A interpenetrated networks. The average PCEs of all OPVs were calculated based on 20 cells. It is interesting that the Voc of ternary OPVs is close to 0.54 V for Si-PCDTBT:PC71BM-based cells and much less than 0.78 V for DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based cells. This means that holes can be efficiently transported along channels formed by Si-PCPDTBT in the ternary active layers. The leading PCE of ternary OPVs is 6.18%, along with a Voc of 0.55 V, Jsc of 18.76 mA cm−2 and FF of 60.0%, respectively. About 12% PCE improvement is obtained compared to Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM-based cells under the same fabrication conditions. Meanwhile, PCE values of ternary OPVs are much larger than the 2.83% for DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based cells. The rather low PCE of 2.83% may be due to excessive phase separation of DIB-SQ:PC71BM, resulting in inefficient exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection. The EQE spectra of OPVs were measured for the cells without encapsulation and are exhibited in Fig. 3b. It is apparent that DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based cells exhibit relatively low EQE values and narrow response range. The EQE spectra of ternary OPVs are slightly increased and then decreased along with DIB-SQ doping ratio increase. According to the EQE spectra of OPVs, Jsc can be calculated according to the equation:
Here,
q is elementary charge, h is Plank constant, c is light speed, λ1 and λ2 are wavelength limits, and Pin(λ) is incident photon flux under AM 1.5G illumination. The key photovoltaic parameters and calculated Jsc of all OPVs were summarized and are listed in Table 2. The calculated Jsc values are slightly less than the measured values. The difference may be mainly attributed to the performance decay of cells without encapsulation and the limited EQE spectral range from 300 nm to 900 nm. To intuitively exhibit the effect of DIB-SQ doping ratios on the phase separation degree of ternary active layers, sectional calculation of Jsc is proposed to analyze the contribution of materials used to the Jsc of OPVs. The contribution of photon harvesting to Jsc was calculated in the spectral range of 750 nm to 900 nm, corresponding to strong absorption of Si-PCPDTBT. According to the EQE spectrum of DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based cells (as shown Fig. 3b), it can be inferred that the contribution of DIB-SQ may be negligible due to the rather low response in this range. It is very interesting that the contribution to Jsc was slightly increased and then decreased with DIB-SQ doping ratio increase. The optimized ternary OPVs exhibit a relatively large Jsc of 2.72 mA cm−2 in this spectral range, which is higher than the sum of Jsc of 2.55 mA cm−2 for Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM-based cells and 0.12 mA cm−2 for DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based cells. It should be highlighted that Si-PCPDTBT content in ternary active layers is decreased with the increase of DIB-SQ doping ratio, which indicates that exciton utilization of Si-PCPDTBT should be enhanced by doping appropriate DIB-SQ in the ternary active layers. The underlying reason may be attributed to the positive effect of DIB-SQ on phase separation for the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport ability in ternary active layers.

To further investigate exciton dissociation in ternary active layers and charge collection efficiency in individual electrodes, photocurrent density (Jph = Jl − Jd)-effective applied voltage (Veff = V0 − Va) curves of OPVs were plotted according to J–V curves under dark and light conditions. Here, Jl and Jd are the current density under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination and in dark conditions, V0 is voltage corresponding to Jph = 0, and Va is the applied bias, respectively. Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of cells measured in dark conditions. It is apparent that DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based cells exhibit a relatively large Jd due to excessive D/A phase separation in DIB-SQ:PC71BM active layers. For Si-PCPDTBT:DIB-SQ:PC71BM- or Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM-based OPVs, Jd values are rather low even under large reverse bias. This implies that vertical phase separation may be optimized in the active layers, resulting in more donor material enriched near the ITO electrode and more PC71BM enriched near the Al electrode, which is beneficial for obtaining low Jd. The Jph–Veff curves of all cells are exhibited in Fig. 4b. For DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based OPVs, Jph could hardly reach saturated state even under large bias, suggesting inefficient charge transport and collection in the cells. For Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM- or Si-PCPDTBT:DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based OPVs, Jph of the OPVs can rapidly reach saturated state under a relatively low bias. For the optimized ternary OPVs, the saturated Jph is larger than that of other cells, suggesting a more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the ternary active layers. Assuming that exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency reach unity at Veff = 2 V, the saturated current density (Jsat) is mainly determined by the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) according to Jsat = qLGmax, where q is elementary charge and L is thickness of the active layer. The Jsat value of optimized ternary OPVs is much larger than that of other cells, indicating that more photons can be harvested in the ternary active layers. The exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection efficiency can be assessed by the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit conditions and maximum power conditions, respectively. All of the key parameters, Jph and Jsat values at Veff = 2 V, Jph/Jsat ratios and Gmax of all cells, are listed in Table 3. The Jph/Jsat ratios reach 89.7% and 72.8% for the optimized ternary OPVs under short circuit and maximum power conditions. The values are much larger than the corresponding values of other cells, suggesting more efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport and collection in the optimized ternary OPVs.

To investigate the impact of DIB-SQ doping ratios on charge transport ability in ternary active layers, hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (50 nm) and electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/PFN/active layers/PFN/Al (100 nm) were prepared. The active layers were prepared under the same conditions as those of OPVs. The DIB-SQ:PC71BM-based electron-only device could not be well prepared due to the serious damage of spin-coating PFN layer on the DIB-SQ:PC71BM blend film. The J–V curves of all hole-only and electron-only devices were measured in dark conditions, as exhibited in Fig. 5a and b. It can be seen that hole and electron transport ability of ternary active layers slightly increase and then decrease along with DIB-SQ doping ratio increase. It means that better D/A bi-continuous networks are formed due to an appropriate DIB-SQ doping ratio in donors, which is beneficial to optimize Si-PCPDTBT molecular arrangement and D/A vertical phase separation. For the single-charge devices with 3 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio, hole and electron current densities simultaneously reach the maximum under the same bias. For the single-charge devices with more doped DIB-SQ in active layers, hole or electron current densities are decreased due to the disturbed charge carrier transport channels, which may be attributed to the excessive aggregation of DIB-SQ in ternary active layers.
To further investigate the effect of DIB-SQ doping ratios on the phase separation of active layers, the morphology of active layers was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and is shown in Fig. 6. For the Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM blend film, the root mean square (RMS) roughness is about 0.4 nm. The RMS of ternary active layers is slightly increased along with the increase of DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors. For the DIB-SQ:PC71BM blend film, the RMS roughness is about 8.1 nm due to the obvious aggregation of DIB-SQ. The morphology of active layers looks more and more homogenous by doping small amounts of DIB-SQ in donors, which means that phase separation of ternary active layers may be optimized for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in the ternary active layers.
To further clarify the role of DIB-SQ in ternary active layers, molecular interaction between Si-PCPDTBT and DIB-SQ was investigated according to absorption and PL spectra of neat and blend films. The normalized absorption and PL spectra of neat films are exhibited in Fig. 7a. An apparent spectral overlap between the PL spectrum of DIB-SQ and absorption spectrum of Si-PCPDTBT can be observed in the range from 700 nm to 780 nm, suggesting an efficient energy transfer from DIB-SQ to Si-PCPDTBT. However, intermolecular energy transfer may be inadequate due to the weak PL emission intensity of DIB-SQ, which can be further confirmed from the PL spectra of neat and blend films, as exhibited in Fig. 7b. It is apparent that PL emission intensity of neat DIB-SQ film is much lower than that of neat Si-PCPDTBT film under 610 nm light excitation. For blend films, PL emission intensity is decreased with DIB-SQ doping ratio increase, which is mainly due to the decreased Si-PCPDTBT content in the ternary active layers. However, photon utilization in the strong absorption range of DIB-SQ is markedly increased for the optimized ternary active layer, as observed from EQE spectra shown in Fig. 3b. This indicates that a portion of the excitons may be dissociated into free charge carriers at the Si-PCPDTBT/DIB-SQ interfaces, which can be inferred from the decreased PL emission intensity of Si-PCPDTBT:DIB-SQ blend films dependent on DIB-SQ doping ratio increase.
To further investigate the intermolecular dynamic process between Si-PCPDTBT and DIB-SQ, a series of devices were fabricated with donor(s) as active layers. The J–V curves of all the devices were measured under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light illumination and are shown in Fig. 8a. It can be envisaged that the performance of devices without an acceptor is rather low due to inefficient exciton dissociation. The Jsc values of devices with Si-PCPDTBT or DIB-SQ as active layer are smaller than those of Si-PCPDTBT:DIB-SQ-based cells, demonstrating that a portion of excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers at the DIB-SQ/Si-PCPDTBT interfaces. With an appropriate DIB-SQ doping ratio, exciton dissociation at DIB-SQ/Si-PCPDTBT interfaces is conducive to efficient exciton utilization in the ternary OPVs. According to the discussion on exciton and charge dynamics process in ternary OPVs, the corresponding process is depicted in Fig. 8b. In the ternary active layers with an appropriate DIB-SQ doping ratio, excitons can be effectively dissociated into free charge carriers at DIB-SQ/Si-PCPDTBT interfaces, in addition to D/A interfaces. According to the energy levels of Si-PCPDTBT and DIB-SQ, holes should be mainly transported along the channels formed by Si-PCDPTBT due to their same highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. Electrons should be transported along the channels formed by PC71BM. With an appropriate DIB-SQ doping ratio, photon harvesting and phase separation in active layers could be optimized to obtain high-performance ternary OPVs.

The performance of OPVs increased and then decreased with the increase of DIB-SQ doping ratios in donors; the PCE of the optimized ternary OPVs reaches 6.18% with 3 wt% DIB-SQ doping ratio. About 12% PCE improvement for the optimized ternary OPVs was obtained compared with Si-PCPDTBT:PC71BM-based OPVs, which is attributed to the synergistically enhanced photon harvesting and exciton utilization efficiency. The increased exciton utilization efficiency is mainly due to the effective charge transfer at Si-PCPDTBT/DIB-SQ interfaces and enhanced charge transport ability in ternary active layers. The performance of ternary OPVs was markedly decreased with further increase in DIB-SQ doping ratios due to the molecular aggregation of DIB-SQ. Based on the sufficiently high PCE of binary OPVs, the performance of ternary OPVs is markedly improved only by the appropriate doping ratio of DIB-SQ in active layers. The experimental results fully demonstrate that the ternary strategy has a brilliant future in obtaining high-performance OPVs with a simple device fabrication process.
