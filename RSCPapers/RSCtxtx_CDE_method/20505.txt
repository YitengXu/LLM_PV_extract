Organic semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices, such as organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), have been investigated for solution-processable roll-to-roll electronic devices. However, for commercial applications, OSCs and OLEDs require highly efficient device performance and effective fabrication processing methods. To achieve this, this work reports the use of solution-processable quinoxaline–phosphine oxide based small molecules (QPSMs) as electron transport layers (ETLs) in OSCs and OLEDs. QPSMs can be dissolved in alcohol owing to the strong dipole moments within their molecular structures, thereby resulting in simple and effective processing during device fabrication. Moreover, QPSMs improve electron injection/extraction via the well-matched energy levels in both OSCs and OLEDs. In particular, optimized OSCs and OLEDs with ((4-(2,3-diphenylquinoxalin-5-yl)phenyl)diphenylphosphine oxide, QxTPPO1) show power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.83% in polymer donor:nonfullerene acceptor systems, PCE of 10.07% in polymer donor:fullerene acceptor systems, and external quantum efficiency of 5.00%, which are enhanced by approximately 23%, 19%, and 12%, respectively, compared to those of the reference devices, thereby exhibiting improved device stability.

Over the past several decades, organic semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been extensively developed for mechanically flexible and solution-processable electronic devices using roll-to-roll and printing techniques. OSCs and OLEDs for commercial applications require highly efficient device performance and effective methods, including simple, inexpensive, and low temperature fabrication processing.

In particular, low work-function (WF) materials such as lithium fluoride (LiF), calcium (Ca), and barium (Ba) are used as effective electron transport layers (ETLs) in conventional devices owing to the well-matched energy levels between the active layers and the metal cathodes. However, alkali-metal compounds exhibit poor device stabilities in the presence of moisture and oxygen. Thus, encapsulation is necessary to protect the devices from ambient conditions. Moreover, the requirement of a vacuum evaporation technique renders the fabrication process complex and poses a limitation to fabricating over a large area.
Recently, for organic optoelectronics, solution-processable n-type metal oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium oxide (TiOx), and hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been proposed as alternative ETLs for alkali-metal compounds owing to their attractive advantages, such as excellent air stability, optical transparency, and mechanical robustness. However, for excellent electron extraction in OSCs and electron injection in OLEDs, the use of n-type metal oxides requires interfacial engineering or surface modifications such as ionic liquid (ILMs), conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), and amine-based interfacial molecules. This is due to the large energy barrier at the interface between the conduction band of n-type metal oxides and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the active layer. Moreover, solution-processable metal oxides must undergo high temperature annealing at over 400 °C for high crystallinity. Therefore, developing efficient and stable ETL materials with simple fabrication properties, including low temperature processing and solution processing, is crucial. To achieve this, organic electron transporting materials created via molecular design with different structures and features have been intensively investigated.
Electron transporting materials consist of n-type structures considered to be electron-deficient heteroaromatics such as triazine, quinoxaline, pyridine, benzothiadiazole, naphthalene diimides, perylene diimides and phenanthroline.
In particular, electron transporting materials including heteroaromatic compounds are usually dissolved in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and chloroform, which can cause the dissolution of the organic active layer after coating with ETL. In addition, it is difficult to stack them layer-by-layer because of the poor solubility of heteroaromatic compounds in alcohol-type solvents that lead to an increase in the interfacial resistance due to poor compatibility between the active layer and ETLs.
Normally, wide energy bandgap materials are required for ETLs in OSCs and OLEDs because of non-absorption and hole-blocking behavior; however, established electron transport materials with extending π-conjugation systems can cause a narrow energy bandgap. Thus, there is still considerable room for the further improvement of methods regarding ETLs because the previously established methods for ETLs have many problems regarding cost and fabrication processing.
Herein, we investigate new synthesized electron transporting materials consisting of quinoxaline and phosphine oxide moieties in OSCs and OLEDs. Low temperature solution-processable quinoxaline–phosphine oxide based small molecules (QPSMs) as ETLs provide simple, inexpensive, and efficient processing. Moreover, QPSMs can be dissolved in alcohol-type solvents such as ethanol, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol by introducing a phosphine oxide group (PO) that can easily stack the ETL on top of the active layer.
In addition, two types of QPSMs make it possible to tune the WF of metal cathodes via the dipole moment depending on the molecule structure, leading to effective electron extraction in OSCs and electron injection in OLEDs.
In particular, the best OSCs using ((4-(2,3-diphenylquinoxalin-5-yl)phenyl)diphenylphosphine oxide, QxTPPO1) show a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.37 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.75, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.83% in a polymer donor:nonfullerene acceptor system, and they show a Jsc of 17.32 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.81 V, FF of 0.72, and PCE of 10.07% in a polymer donor:fullerene acceptor system. Moreover, the best OLEDs using QxTPPO1 show a luminance of 26400 cd m−2, a luminous efficiency (LE) of 14.45 cd A−1, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.00% in OLEDs.

We designed and synthesized new electron transporting materials, such as QxTPPO1 and ((2,3-diphenylquinoxaline-5,8-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(diphenylphosphine oxide) (QxTPPO2), using n-type organic compounds including quinoxaline and phosphine oxide moieties, as shown in Fig. 1a. The QPSMs were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction. The detailed synthetic method is given in ESI.

Owing to its electron-deficient nature, a quinoxaline derivative is often used for efficient electron transporting. In addition, a phosphine oxide group has been introduced to the quinoxaline derivative to enhance not only the dipole moment of the entire molecule but also the solubility in common solvents such as methanol, isopropyl alcohol and chloroform (see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in ESI). Moreover, phosphine oxide provides the deepest and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of ∼6.1 eV as the σ-acceptor and large bandgap of ∼3.2 eV because of the interruption of the extended conjugation system, leading to hole-blocking behavior.
The thermal properties of QPSMs have been investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA was performed at a heating rate 10 °C min−1 under ambient conditions. QxTPPO1 and QxTPPO2 show good thermal stability with 370.8 and 456.9 °C of decomposition temperature 5 wt% loss (Td 5%), respectively, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI).
To obtain the energy levels of QPSMs, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry. Fig. S3a and b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of QxTPPO1 and QxTPPO2 in diluted isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solution and as thin films, which are slightly different. According to the chemical architecture, the symmetric molecule (QxTPPO2) shows red-shifted absorption compared to the asymmetric molecule (QxTPPO1) because the additional phenyl ring of triphenylphosphine oxide contributes to a relatively longer conjugation length. The optical band gap of QxTPPO1 (3.10 eV) and QxTPPO2 (2.97 eV) has been explored via thin films.
Moreover, the electrochemical properties of QPSMs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The measurements were performed on thin film condition and are shown in Fig. S3c (ESI). The HOMO and LUMO of QxTPPO1 and QxTPPO2 were confirmed as 6.22 and 3.01 eV and 6.17 and 3.06 eV, respectively. In addition, the electrochemical bandgap of QxTPPO1 (3.21 eV) and QxTPPO2 (3.11 eV) were calculated via CV, which shows a similar trend as the optical bandgap. Detailed information about the optical and electrochemical properties is summarized in Table S2 (ESI).

Fig. 1b shows illustrations of the full device structure for OSCs and OLEDs. OSCs consist of indium tin oxide (ITO) as a transparent anode; poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a hole transport layer; poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluoro-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl[5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,8-dioxo-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-1,3-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PM6):2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) in a polymer donor:nonfullerene acceptor system; poly[(4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno-[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) in a polymer donor:fullerene acceptor system as an active layer; Ca,3,3′-(1,3,8,10-tetraoxoanthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-2,9(1H,3H,8H,10H)-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine oxide) (PDINO) or QPSMs as ETLs; and aluminum (Al) as a cathode. The device structure of OLEDs is similar to OSCs; however, it has a different emissive layer using Super Yellow (SY) and ETLs using LiF or QPMs. The chemical structures of PM6:Y6, PTB7-Th:PC70BM and SY are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The detailed fabrication of OSCs and OLEDs is given in the Experimental section. The energy level diagrams of OSCs and OLEDs with QPSMs are illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI). The energy levels of QxTPPO1 and QxTPPO2 were determined by the results of CV and show a slight difference depending on the chemical structure.
The theoretical molecular energy of QPSMs was determined using the density functional theory (DFT: UCAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) in the Gaussian 09 program to investigate the effect of QPSMs depending on the chemical structure. The calculated molecular dipole moments of the QPSMs were confirmed as 4.85 and 7.36 debye (D), as shown in Fig. 2a. The strong molecular dipole moment was generated by the large difference in the electronic nature between the electron-donating phenyl rings of quinoxaline and electron-accepting phosphine oxide unit.
The coated QPSMs form the interfacial dipole between the active layer and the cathode, which can induce the tuned WF of Al, as shown in Fig. 2b. Moreover, the experimental measurement was performed using a Kelvin probe to confirm the tuned WF of Al with the different ETLs. As shown in Fig. 2c, the WF of Al with ETLs was significantly tuned compared to pristine Al. Basically, the WF of pristine Al is ∼4.3 eV, whereas the tuned WF of Al with different ETLs such as LiF, QxTPPO1, and QxTPPO2 are ∼3.87, ∼3.81, and ∼4.00 eV, respectively.
The tuned WF originates from two contributions: (i) the intrinsic molecular dipole (μMD) and (ii) the surface interfacial dipole (μID) formed at the polymer/electrode interface. The net dipoles of QxTPPO1 can be stronger than those of QxTPPO2 according to the arrangement at the organic/electrode interface, even when the molecular dipole of QxTPPO2 is stronger than that of QxTPPO1. It is known that electron transfer is very sensitive to the energy barrier at the interface between cathode and active layer. Therefore the reduced energy barrier obtained by tuned WF of Al cathode leads to better electron injection from Al electrode to luminescent materials in OLED. In addition, the reduced energy difference between LUMO level of acceptor and WF of Al in OSC results in efficient electron collection at the Al electrode due to reduced energy loss.
To confirm the stability of the active layers after coating QPSMs dissolved in IPA, the modification of their thin films was examined using atomic force microscopy with and without QPSMs, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). The morphology and the rms roughness of all active layers had only a negligible change after coating the QPSMs.
In general, well-balanced charge transport is required for improved device performance. To optimize the devices, we demonstrated the device efficiency for OSCs and OLEDs depending on the concentration of the QPSMs, as shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI), respectively. These results are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI). Optimized concentrations of QPSMs show 1.0 mg ml−1 in OSCs and 2.0 mg ml−1 in OLEDs. The thick ETLs can block the holes in OLEDs effectively, whereas they can interrupt the direct charge transfer (extraction) from the active layer to the cathode in OSCs because the operating electrical field is weaker in OSCs compared to OLEDs.

Fig. 3 shows the device performance of OSCs and OLEDs depending on ETLs. Fig. 3a–d exhibit the J–V characteristics and EQE characteristics of OSCs with and without ETLs under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. Both QxTPPO1 and QxTPPO2 cause improved device performances in OSCs. In particular, optimized OSCs with QxTPPO1 (1 mg ml−1, 6000 rpm) exhibit significant improvements with a Jsc of 26.37 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.86 V, an FF of 0.75, a PCE of 16.83% in the PM6:Y6 system, and a Jsc of 17.32 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, an FF of 0.72, and a PCE of 10.07% in the PTB7-Th:PC70BM system. Introducing QPSMs in OSC devices provide notable enhancement of all factors, including Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE, because of the enhanced electron transport from tuned Al compared to the reference device without ETLs.
It is difficult to effectively inject electrons into OLEDs without ETLs, thereby causing poor device performance. However, OLEDs with QPSMs enhances electron injection, thereby improving device performance, as shown in Fig. 3e–h. In particular, optimized OLEDs with asymmetric molecule QxTPPO1 (2 mg ml−1, 3000 rpm) show a luminance of 26400 cd m−2, LE of 14.45 cd A−1, and EQE of 5.00%, which means an enhanced luminance of ∼9%, enhanced LE of ∼8%, and enhanced EQE of ∼12% in comparison to the control OLEDs with LiF (reference devices). However, the device efficiency of optimized OLEDs with symmetric molecule QxTPPO2 (2 mg ml−1, 3000 rpm) was lower than that of the control devices; however, the use of QxTPPO2 improved the device performance in comparison with to OLEDs without ETLs. Moreover, the operating voltage of OLEDs with QxTPPO2 is higher than that of OLEDs with QxTPPO1 and control devices, which results from the poor injection/transport of electrons. These results indicate that asymmetric molecule QxTPPO1 can improve the efficient injection/transport of electrons and can block holes better than symmetric molecule QxTPPO2. The J–V–L characteristic is consistent with the Kelvin probe measurement results. The details of the device performance of OSCs and OLEDs are summarized in Table 1.

The electron transport efficiency was confirmed by the electron only device characteristic in Fig. 4a and b. The configurations of the electron only device are ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC70BM/ETL/Al with and without QPSMs. The electron mobility was measured by the space-charge-limited current method (below Fig. 4b) following equation:
where
J is the current density, μeff is the effective charge carrier mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity, d is the active layer thickness, and V is the effective voltage. The J–V characteristics of electron only devices were fitted by the Mott–Gurney law. The measured μeff of the devices with and without QPSMs are 2.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Al only), 4.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (QxTPPO1), and 4.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (QxTPPO2), as listed in Table S5 (ESI). The electron mobility of QPSM-based devices is higher than that of the reference device, suggesting that the QPSMs contribute to better electron transport in the devices.

To investigate device resistance with QPSMs, electrical impedance spectroscopy was conducted under dark and light conditions for OSC devices, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. Since the interface resistance (Rinterface) is related to the interface charge transport process, the smaller Rinterface of the devices with QPSMs indicates more efficient charge transport. In addition this tendencies are observed in the devices under light conditions. Hence, it is obvious that introducing QPSMs as ETLs in photovoltaic devices leads to lower Rinterface indicating more efficient electron transport in OSC devices.
Furthermore, the dark current density and differential resistance of the devices of OSCs with QPSMs was measured, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The J–V characteristics of QPSM-based devices are comparable with that of the reference cell under reverse bias. Meanwhile, in the high voltage region, we obtained enhanced current from QPSM-based devices compared to reference device, which implies a lower series resistance (Rs) in QPSMs based devices. Thus, it is considered that the FF is substantially influenced by QPSMs due to the higher Rsh and lower Rs of devices with QPSMs in comparison with the reference. The Rsh and Rs values were calculated by differential resistance from plotting the J–V characteristics (see Fig. S9 and Table S6 in ESI). To explore more details of the role of QPSMs in OSCs, the total absorption and reflectance spectra of OSCs with and without QPSMs were confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy (see Fig. S10 in ESI). The QPSMs turned out to optically influence OSC devices; the absorption and reflectance spectra of QPSMs changed, and it seemingly plays the role of an optical spacer.
To investigate the PL lifetime of SY using different ETLs, the PL decay in glass/SY, glass/SY/LiF, glass/SY/QxTPPO1, and glass/SY/QxTPPO2 were measured using time-correlated single photon counting, as shown in Fig. 4g and Table S7 (ESI). The PL lifetime is similar in all samples, which means that PL lifetime of SY is preserved even after coating QPMSs on the SY layers. Moreover, the relative PL intensities of SY with and without QPMSs are similar, as shown in Fig. 4h. Thus, QPSMs do not seem to be causing the exciton quenching at the interface.
To demonstrate the long-term device stability of OSCs and OLEDs by ETLs, stability measurement was conducted under the ambient condition without encapsulation. Each device performance was measured each day. The J–V curves of OSCs with and without ETLs were characterized and are shown in Fig. S11a and S12. After 50 hours, the devices with the ETLs retained nearly 80% of their efficiency, whereas the control device without ETL retained only 10% of their initial efficiency. In particular the original J–V slopes of the device with Ca/Al electrode remarkably changed to a sigmoidal shape. These tendencies were also observed in the devices with ETLs after 550 hours. The sigmoidal J–V slope of the exposed devices is usually related to the degradation of interface between metal cathode and active layer (or ETL layer). Therefore, we infer the degradation of devices in this work is mainly caused by degradation of interface between Al cathode and active layer. In addition OLEDs with QPSMs exhibited significantly more stability than LiF-based OLEDs and Ca-based OSCs as shown in Fig. S11b (ESI).

In summary, two types QPSMs consisting of quinoxaline and phosphine oxide derivatives were newly designed for ETLs, and the WF was controlled by introducing a strong dipole moment from phosphine oxide via molecular designing. Moreover, alcohol soluble electron transport materials, QxTPPO1 and QxTPPO2, were successfully synthesized, and we have demonstrated promoted electron transport and extraction in OSCs and OLEDs with QPSMs, which results in greatly enhanced device performance. The optimized OSCs and OLEDs exhibited PCEs of 16.83% in the polymer donor:nonfullerene acceptor system and 10.07% in the polymer donor:fullerene acceptor system and a EQE of 5.00%, which were enhanced by approximately 23%, 19%, and 12%, respectively, compared to the reference devices. In particular, this PCE value is comparable to high reported efficiencies in OSCs of polymer donor:nonfullerene acceptor systems (Table S8 in ESI). Thus, our ETL materials are excellent candidates for improved stability and highly efficient optoelectronic devices.


The OSC device was fabricated the same way as the OLED device. After UV-ozone treatment, a PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083, Clevios) solution (filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter) was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 45 s onto an ITO substrate then baked at 150 °C for 10 min.

A solution of poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluoro-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl[5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,8-dioxo-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-1,3-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PM6) and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) (1:1) in chloroform (CF):chloronaphthalene (CN) (99.5:0.5, vol%) was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer for the polymer donor:nonfullerene acceptor system.
A solution of poly[(4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno-[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) (1:1.5) in chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (97:3 vol%) was then spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer for the polymer donor:fullerene acceptor system. The OSC film was dried for 30 min at room temperature in a glove box. Finally, the QPSMs were spin-cast at 6000 rpm, and a 100 nm layer of Al was thermally deposited.
An OLED device was fabricated on patterned ITO-coated glass substrates, which were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatments in acetone and IPA. After the UV-ozone treatment, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, AI 4083, Clevios) solution (filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter) was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 45 s onto the ITO substrate then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. A poly(phenylvinylene), known as SY (Merck Co., Mw = 1950000 g mol−1) solution dissolved in chlorobenzene (0.7 wt%) was spin cast at 2000 rpm on top of the PEDOT:PSS to obtain a 150 nm thick SY layer. Finally, the QPSMs were spin cast at 3000 rpm, and a 100 nm layer of Al was thermally deposited.
The solar cell performance was examined using an Air Mass 1.5 Global solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The IPCE was measured by a xenon lamp with a monochromator and a multimeter. The device performance of the OLEDs was measured using a source meter (Keithley 2450) and spectroradiometer (CS-2000, Konica Minolta) under ambient atmosphere. The current density–voltage characteristics of the OSC devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit.
