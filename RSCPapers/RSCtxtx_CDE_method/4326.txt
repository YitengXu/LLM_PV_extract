The development of bifacial semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST-OPVs) is hindered by the limited choice of suitable rear transparent electrodes. Herein, tellurium oxide (TeO2) featuring a high refractive index and negligible optical absorption is incorporated as the optical coupling layer atop the ultrathin Ag electrode to control the optical interference between the transmitted light into the OPV device and the reflected light by a relatively thin Ag film. The corresponding champion bifacial ST-OPVs based on PM6:Y6:PC71BM with Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.14% illuminated from the ITO side and a decent PCE of 9.18% from the Ag side. Apart from the dramatically enhanced bifaciality factor from 49.09% to 90.53%, this integration also significantly improves the average visible transmittance (AVT) from 19.20% to 27.83%, the color-rendering index (CRI) from 74.56 to 88.28, and the light utilization efficiency (LUE) from 2.32%/1.14% to 2.82%/2.32%. In parallel, the TeO2 layer endowed the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system with higher values of AVT, LUE, bifaciality factor and CRI in the corresponding ST-OPVs. Our results demonstrate that the application of an Ag/TeO2 rear electrode offers a versatile, facile, and universal approach to upgrading the performance of bifacial ST-OPVs towards commercial applications.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies due to the abundance of photoactive materials, freedom of the form factor, and environmental friendliness. Recently, opaque OPVs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >18% have been reported due to the concerted efforts of organic semiconductive materials, interfaces, and device engineering. The most unique advantage of OPVs is their absorption spectra. The organic photoactive materials are intrinsically quantum-confined, forming discrete electron energy levels in comparison with continuous bands in crystalline-Si and perovskites. Thus, OPV devices can focus the absorption of light in the ultra-violet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) regions, allowing transparency in the visible range. In terms of commercialization, semitransparent OPVs (ST-OPVs) can be made into in-demand products of building-integrated photovoltaics and smart power-generating windows, providing the very precious entry point into the niche market of the photovoltaic field.

Compared with opaque OPVs, ST-OPVs have other important figures of merit, including average visible transmittance (AVT), light utilization efficiency (LUE = PCE × AVT), and the color-rendering index (CRI), to co-evaluate transparent OPV technologies. On one hand, the main challenge to obtain highly efficient ST-OPVs lies in the dilemma between transparency and device efficiency. On the other hand, the precision of demonstrated color should be considered for an ST-OPV used in human vision-related applications. The transparent electrode plays a vital role in controlling the parameters AVT, LUE, and CRI. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is the preferred option to construct a semitransparent electrode due to its good compromise between optical transparency (greater than 80%) and electrical properties (∼10−4 Ω cm). However, the sputtering deposition method of ITO limits its application as a rear electrode. Currently, many other materials are utilized for rear electrodes with high transparency and high conductivity, including conductive polymers (PEDOT:PSS), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), graphene, metal nanowires, and ultrathin metal films. Ultrathin metal films are a common choice prepared via the thermal evaporation method. Recently, ST-OPVs with ultrathin Ag rear electrodes exhibited an encouraging PCE of 13.49% with a fair AVT of 22.58% relative to the opaque counterpart with a PCE of 16.73%. The thickness of metal films needs accurate control to achieve the trade-off between transmittance and conductivity.
The high transmittance of ST-OPVs naturally means its light harvesting from both front and rear sides. Bifacial solar cells and module technology offer the unique advantage on sites with high albedo, and can harvest direct, diffused, and reflected sunlight. Nonetheless, rarely have the bifacial ST-OPVs been reported. The bifaciality factor, defined as the ratio of the rear side efficiency to the front side efficiency, is a key indicator of the performance of bifacial photovoltaics. The limited choice of rear transparent electrodes weighs heavily for the stagnating bifacial ST-OPVs. To obtain high-performance bifacial ST-OPVs, electrode engineering should be carried out to guarantee high light transmittance and electrical conductivity simultaneously. Herein, we employ tellurium oxide (TeO2) featuring a high refractive index atop the ultrathin Ag electrode as the optical coupling layer (Fig. 1a). This integration significantly improves not only parameters AVT, LUE and CRI, but also the bifaciality factor. We first study the controlled bifacial ST-OPVs with a bare Ag film, where Ag with optimal 11 nm affords ST-OPVs with a PCE of 12.10% illuminated from the ITO side and 5.94% from the Ag side. The inferior efficiency from the Ag-side illumination results from the high reflection of the Ag electrode. The application of TeO2 decreases the reflection of the Ag electrode and thereby induces the improved transmission of ST-OPVs, attributed to the altered distribution of absorption intensity among wavelengths at the Ag/TeO2–air interface. The simulations of the absorption and exciton generation rate at different wavelengths are performed to guide the optimization of bifacial ST-OPVs. As a result, ST-OPVs with an Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) composite electrode successfully demonstrate a high PCE of 10.14% (ITO side) and a decent PCE of 9.18% (Ag side), delivering a satisfactory high bifaciality factor of 90.53% and a CRI of up to 88.28, accompanied by a high AVT of 27.83% and LUE of 2.82%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, and integrated transmission (T) and reflection (R) values are investigated to confirm the accuracy of the tests. The Ag/TeO2 rear electrode also works in the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system with more redshifted absorption, providing the corresponding semi-transparent device with increased values of AVT (from 33.19% to 46.03%), LUE (from 3%/1.28% to 3.15%/2.55%), bifaciality factor (from 42.65% to 80.77%) and CRI (from 65.23 to 76.43). Our results unveil that the application of the Ag/TeO2 rear electrode is a versatile, facile and universal approach to improving the performance of bifacial ST-OPVs towards practical commercialization.

High performance material systems, PM6:Y6 binary and PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary systems, are fabricated and compared in the beginning of our study. The device architecture is glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINN/Ag. The PM6:Y6 binary system exhibited device performance with a PCE of 16.17% with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 24.98 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.859 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.35% (Table S1, ESI). Compared to the binary system, the PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary system device obtained a higher PCE of 17.10%, accompanied by a JSC of 25.72 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.874 V, and an FF of 76.07% (Table 1 and Fig. S1, ESI). The photovoltaic performances of the devices based on PM6:Y6 and PM6:Y6:PC71BM systems are summarized in Table S2 (ESI). The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) are evaluated by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only device and the electron-only devices utilize the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINN/Ag, respectively. Fig. S2 (ESI) displays the J0.5versus Vapp curves for PM6:Y6 and PM6:Y6:PC71BM active layer systems. It was found that the ratio of electron–hole mobility of the PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary device was closer to 1, which is beneficial for charge transport and thus high performance. Therefore, the ternary blend film of PM6:Y6:PC71BM is utilized as the active layer in this study (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1c shows the strong visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) absorption of the PM6:Y6:PC71BM film.

To investigate the maximum obtainable photocurrent density in the bifacial ST-OPVs, optical modeling calculations based on the transfer matrix method (TMM) theory are conducted with a structure of glass/ITO (150 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PM6:Y6:PC71BM (0–500 nm)/PDINN (10 nm)/Ag (0–50 nm). All the complex refractive indexes (η + iκ) of correlated materials are measured by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), and the fitted results are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI). The simulations are based on assumptions of planar interfaces and total isotropy for all layers. As shown in Fig. 2a, the current density of OPVs illuminated from the ITO side is improved monotonically along with the increased thickness of the Ag film (0–50 nm). In terms of the active layer's thickness, the current density first quickly increases in the initial ∼100 nm and then oscillates in the range of 100–500 nm. The stronger oscillation at larger Ag thickness is attributed to the optical interference between the transmitted light into the device and the reflected light by the Ag film. When OPVs are illuminated from the Ag side (Fig. 2b), the corresponding simulated JSC falls steeply with the increased thickness of the Ag film. The simulated JSC approaches zero when the Ag film is thicker than 30 nm due to the low transmittance and high reflection. Theoretically, a bifaciality factor of 100% could be achieved for bifacial ST-OPVs with an ultrathin 3 nm Ag film assuming the adequate conductivity of the Ag electrode (Fig. 2c). In reality, Ag at a very small thickness fails to form a uniform, continuous, and ultra-thin film due to the Volmer–Weber growth mechanism, which reduces the transmittance and increases the corresponding sheet resistance of the electrodes. When the thickness of the Ag film is below 5 nm, the film is nonconductive because of the discontinuity of Ag islands. As shown in Fig. 2d, the conductivity of the Ag film with different thicknesses, deposited on PDINN/glass with a high evaporation rate of 5 Å s−1, is measured through a four-point probe method. The Ag electrodes at thicknesses of 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 nm presented sheet resistances of 9035.8, 914.21, 9.33, 7.15, and 5.55 Ω sq−1, respectively.
The transmittance of glass/PDINN/Ag substrates differing in the Ag thickness is also measured. As shown in Fig. 3a, the substrate with a 9 nm Ag film exhibits higher transmittance than the counterparts with thicker Ag films (11, 13, and 15 nm). The 7 nm Ag based substrate is abnormally more opaque than its analog with 9 nm Ag, presumably resulting from the strong surface plasmon resonance effect of isolated Ag islands. To study the influence of Ag thickness on the photovoltaic performance, ST-OPVs varying in Ag thicknesses are fabricated and the optical transmittances of the corresponding devices are measured (Fig. 3b). The optical transmittance of these devices decreases gradually with the increased thickness of the Ag electrode from 9 to 15 nm. The devices with 7 nm Ag exhibit lower transmittance than the counterparts with 9 nm Ag, parallel to the changing trend of the transmittance of glass/PDINN/Ag. All the devices are illuminated under AM 1.5G at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from the ITO side and the Ag side, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. When illuminated from the ITO side (Fig. 3c), ST-OPVs with the 7 nm Ag electrode exhibit a PCE of 9.28% with a JSC of 15.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.835 V, and a FF of 70.88%. The relatively low FF mainly originates from inferior Ag conductivity. Ag electrodes with thicknesses of 9, 11, 13, and 15 nm enable ST-OPVs with higher PCEs of 11.10%, 12.10%, 12.36%, and 12.77%, respectively. The improved efficiency at larger Ag thickness is mainly attributed to the enhanced back reflective sunlight of the Ag electrode and thereby more efficient photons harvest in the photoactive layer. By contrast, ST-OPVs illuminated from the Ag side reveal gradually decreased efficiencies with the increased Ag thickness. The devices with Ag thicknesses of 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 nm show low PCEs of 6.98%, 6.18%, 5.94%, 4.97%, and 4.14%, respectively (Fig. 3d). The bifaciality factor also gradually descends from 75.22% to 32.89% with the increased Ag thickness. ST-OPVs with 9 nm Ag show the highest AVT of 20.21%.
To reduce the strong reflection of the Ag film, an optically tuned TeO2 layer is coupled with the Ag film on account of its high refractive index and negligible optical loss in the vis-NIR range (Fig. S3d, ESI). TeO2 acts as an optical anti-reflective film to effectively increase the optical transmittance of the incident Ag side. The principle of TeO2 anti-reflective films can be explained by the equivalent interface method as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). Considering both the electrical properties and optical transmittance, the 11 nm Ag film that endows the device with a FF of 76.68% is selected as the rear electrode to pair with the TeO2 layer. The simulation of photocurrent density is performed to optimize the thickness of TeO2 coupling layers via the transfer-matrix method. As shown in Fig. 4a, the simulated JSC of the devices illuminated from the Ag side first increases when the thickness of TeO2 is increased from 0 to 40 nm, and then decreases when the TeO2 thickness ascends from 40 to 60 nm. The simulated JSC of devices with ITO-side illumination shows an exactly opposite trend. To verify the simulation, ST-OPVs that differ in the thickness of the TeO2 layer (0–60 nm) were fabricated. The AVT value of ST-OPVs is improved to different extents at the different thickness of the TeO2 capping layer relative to that of the device with a bare Ag electrode (Fig. 4b and Table S3, ESI). The highest AVT of 27.83% is achieved in ST-OPVs with the Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) electrode.
The simulations of the optoelectronic field intensity distribution in the ST-OPVs with Ag (11 nm) and Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) electrodes are carried out to reveal the effect of the TeO2 capping layer on the optical interference from ITO and Ag side illumination (Fig. S5, ESI). When illuminated from the ITO side, ST-OPVs with the Ag/TeO2 electrode exhibit higher simulated electric field intensity than their counterpart with the bare Ag electrode in the wavelength range of 300–500 nm (Fig. S5a and c, ESI). In the 500–950 nm region, devices with the Ag/TeO2 electrode exhibit an apparent decreased simulated electric field intensity. As shown in Fig. S5b and d (ESI), the simulated electric field intensity of devices under Ag-side illumination shows an opposite changing trend to that under ITO-side illumination. The integration of the Ag rear electrode and TeO2 layer largely reduces the reflection loss at the ultra-thin Ag–air surface, leading to the enhanced light absorption and thus the increased JSC under rear illumination.
To explore the exciton generation rate at different wavelengths in ST-OPVs illuminated from each side, simulation is conducted on the assumption that excitons are generated over the entire inner layers (Fig. 4c and d). Under ITO-side illumination, ST-OPVs without the TeO2 layer generate excitons more efficiently and thereby exhibit an enhanced JSC of 22.21 mA cm−2 than their counterpart with the TeO2 capping layer (19.29 mA cm−2), as the sole Ag electrode exhibits higher reflectivity than the Ag/TeO2 electrode. By contrast, the introduction of a TeO2 optical coupling layer enhances the absorption and thereby increases JSC from 9.94 to 16.04 mA cm−2 when the devices are illuminated from the rear side (Fig. 4d).
The photovoltaic and optical performance of ST-OPVs with Ag/TeO2 (20–60 nm) electrodes are shown in Table S3 and Fig. S6 (ESI). The experimental JSC values present a similar trend to the simulated ones (Fig. 4a). As shown in Fig. 5a, when illuminated from the ITO side, the device with the bare Ag (11 nm) electrode obtains a PCE of 12.10% with a JSC of 18.85 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.847 V, and a FF of 75.79%; while its counterpart with a 40 nm TeO2 layer obtains a low PCE of 10.14% due to the decreased JSC of 16.04 mA cm−2. When illuminated from the Ag side (Fig. 5b), the device with a TeO2 layer (40 nm) reveals over 50% PCE enhancement (PCE of 9.18%) relative to its counterpart with bare Ag (PCE of 5.94%), due to the obviously larger JSC in the former device. The devices with Ag and Ag/TeO2 electrodes illuminated from the rear side both present a slightly higher FF, indicative of more efficient charge transport and collection under relatively weak illumination. The statistical data of twelve cells with Ag (11 nm) and Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) electrodes are summarized in Fig. S7 (ESI), and the Gaussian distribution of VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE values shows the good process repeatability for bifacial ST-OPVs with the Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) transparent electrode. Devices with a 40 nm TeO2 capping layer exhibit the highest AVT of 27.83% and the highest bifaciality factor of 90.53%, which is calculated from the ratio of the efficiencies illuminated from the rear side (PCE of 9.18%) and front side (PCE of 10.14%). Fig. 5c and d provide the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and integrated JSCs of the corresponding ST-OPVs, which are close to the extracted JSC from the experimental J–V curves and confirm the accuracy of the measurements.
To systematically investigate the performance of ST-OPVs with Ag (11 nm) and Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) electrodes, the transmission (T) and reflection (R) of the devices are also measured (Fig. S8, ESI). Regarding the concept of photon balance, the sum of T, R, and EQE should be less than unity at each wavelength to avoid the overestimation of device efficiency. When illuminated from the ITO side, the average EQE value of bifacial ST-OPVs with the bare Ag electrode reaches 60% in the spectral range of 480–800 nm with an integrated JSC of 17.95 mA cm−2, and that of the bifacial ST-OPVs with Ag/TeO2 is above 50% in the range of 350–800 nm, leading to an integrated JSC of 15.37 mA cm−2. The valley of the EQE curve from 480 to 800 nm is ascribed to the unabsorbed light and higher reflection loss (Fig. S8a and c, ESI). Parallelly, when illuminated from the rear side, the EQE average value of the devices with bare Ag and Ag/TeO2 electrodes reaches ∼25% and ∼40% in the range of 300–800 nm, resulting in the respective integrated JSCs of 9.07 and 13.44 mA cm−2. The results also confirm that the TeO2 capping layer improves light transmission and reduces reflection loss (Fig. S8b and d, ESI).
The AM 1.5G solar spectrum as the benchmark can more directly evaluate the performance and aesthetic characteristics of ST-OPV devices. The Commission Internationale de l'éclairage-CIE 1931 color coordinates of the transmitted light under AM 1.5G, and the corresponding color rendering index (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of the bifacial ST-OPVs are summarized in Fig. 5e and Table 2. The CIE 1931 coordinate of AM 1.5G is (0.332, 0.344) with a CCT of 5513 K. The CIE 1931 coordinates of bifacial ST-OPVs with bare Ag (11 nm) and Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) electrodes are (0.267, 0.291) and (0.298, 0.316), corresponding to CCTs of 11193 K and 7547 K, respectively. The optical transmittance is examined by the photograph taken in a view of solar light transmission (Fig. 5f). The experimental results indicate that the optical capping layer significantly improves the devices’ CRI from 74.56 to 88.28. In addition, the AVT, PCE, LUE, and CRI of all devices are summarized to directly evaluate the performance of ST-OPVs (Table S4 and Fig. S10, ESI). The TeO2 capping layer endows ST-OPVs with increased AVT, LUE, and CRI, exceeding its counterpart with the bare Ag electrode. The highest LUE of 2.82% is achieved in the devices (Ag/TeO2, 11/40 nm) with an improved AVT of 27.83% and CRI of 88.28.

To further verify the universality of the versatile TeO2 optical capping layer, we also utilize another donor/acceptor system (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, Fig. 6a) featuring more redshifted absorption (Fig. 6b). The corresponding opaque OPVs achieve a high PCE of 11.40% (JSC = 23.53 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.721 V, and FF = 67.22%) in Fig. S10 (ESI). As for the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system, the TeO2 layer effectively improves its AVT from 33.19% to 46.03%, enhances its LUE from 3%/1.28% to 3.15%/2.55%, increases its bifaciality from 42.65% to 80.77%, and boosts the CRI from 65.23 to 76.43 (Table S5, ESI and Fig. 6). These results soundly demonstrate the strong potential of the TeO2 optical capping layer to effectively regulate the balance between the PCE and AVT of ST-OPVs.

To summarize, we successfully designed and constructed a series of high-performance bifacial ST-OPVs with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/PDINN/Ag/TeO2. The controlled PM6:Y6:PC71BM based ST-OPVs with a sole ultrathin Ag electrode exhibit unbalanced PCEs of 12.10% and 5.94% illuminated from ITO and Ag sides, resulting from the high reflection of the bare Ag film. With TeO2 optical layer modulation at the Ag–air interface, transmittances of bifacial ST-OPVs are enhanced to different extents with various thicknesses of the TeO2 layer. Combined with the calculations and experimental data, bifacial ST-OPVs with the optimized Ag/TeO2 (11/40 nm) electrode exhibit a high PCE of 10.14% (ITO side) and a decent PCE of 9.18% (Ag side), delivering a high bifaciality factor of 90.53% and a high AVT of 27.83%, corresponding to the 1931 CIE coordinate of (0.298, 0.316) and a CCT of 7547 K, respectively. Moreover, TeO2 has multiple functions of improving the LUE from 2.32% to 2.82%, and the CRI from 74.56 to 88.28. The method of incorporating TeO2 is very simple, requiring only one additional evaporation step. The application of the TeO2 capping layer in semi-transparent devices based on PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F improves its AVT from 33.19% to 46.03%, its LUE from 3%/1.28% to 3.15%/2.55%, its bifaciality from 42.65% to 80.77%, and its CRI from 65.23 to 76.43. In short, our results show that the application of the Ag/TeO2 back electrode provides a versatile, facile and universal method that will have great potential to upgrade bifacial ST-OPVs to commercial applications in the future.

The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated at a speed of 4000 rpm onto the ITO glass, and annealed at 150 for 15 min. PM6:Y6:PC71BM was dissolved in a 1:1:0.2 w/w/w ratio with a total concentration of 18 mg mL−1 in chloroform. The additive, 0.5% vol of 1-chloronaphthalene, was added. PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (10 mg mL−1 for polymer) was dissolved with a ratio (1:1.2 w/w) in chlorobenzene. 3% vol of 1-chloronaphthalene as the additive was added. Active layers were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer in a nitrogen-filled glove box and thermal annealing treatment at 100 °C for 10 min to form active layers of 100 nm. Then methanol solution of PDINN at a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 was deposited on the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s to afford a cathode buffer layer. The rear electrodes (Ag/TeO2) were evaporated. The ultrathin Ag rear electrode is evaporated via a thermal evaporator with a rate of 5.0 Å s−1 under 10−4 Pa. The effective area of the device is 4 mm2. The optical capping layer TeO2 film is in sequence evaporated at a rate of 1.0 Å s−1 atop the Ag electrode.


Device performance was measured in a glove box. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were determined using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and a Newport solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA) with AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). A standard Si secondary reference cell cover with a KG-5 filter was utilized to calibrate the illumination intensity. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured with a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd) equipped with a standard Si diode. It should be emphasized that the measured AVT value is different from the human eye perception. The AVT value is determined by calculating the average value of the transmittance of a semitransparent device in the visible light wavelength range (370–740 nm) based on the photonic response of the human eye. The AVT value of ST-OPVs can be calculated according to the following equation:
where
T(λ) is the transmission spectrum of ST-OPVs, P(λ) is the photopic response of the human eye, and AM 1.5G(λ) is the photon flux under AM 1.5G light illumination conditions.


The theoretical calculation based on the transfer matrix method (TMM) is employed to acquire the distribution of the optoelectronic field in devices illuminated from both sides. The optical properties of each layer are represented by the indexes of refraction (η + iκ), measured using a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE). In the calculation, all the simulations of optical properties and exciton generation are based on the assumptions of planar interfaces and isotropy for the layers within the devices.
