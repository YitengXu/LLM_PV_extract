An optimal small amount of water added into methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) solution in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) helps perovskite crystallization and leads to larger grain size from sequential deposition of perovskite films. The concentration of water was varied from 1% to 7% (vol% of IPA) in MAI solution and optical absorption, crystallization, morphology of perovskite films and their photovoltaic performance were studied in perovskite solar cells. 5% by volume was found to lead to preferential crystallization in the (110) plane with grain size about three times that of perovskite films prepared without adding water into the MAI solution. The optimal water concentration of 5% by volume in the MAI solution led to average perovskite grain size of ∼600 nm and solar cell efficiency of 12.42% at forward scan with a rate of 0.5 V s−1. Device performance decreases after increasing water concentration beyond 5% in the MAI solution due to formation of the PbI2 phase. Transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements show the shortest charge transport time at 0.99 μs and the longest charge carrier life time at 13.6 μs for perovskite films prepared from 5% water in MAI solution, which improved perovskite solar cell efficiency from 9.04% to 12.42%.

Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite is attracting immense interest in the field of photovoltaics as a promising material for achieving optimum standards for PV technology. It is simple to process with outstanding optoelectronic properties and had shown power conversion efficiency exceeding 20% recently and outperformed other solar cells based on DSCs, small molecules and polymer solar cells. The first perovskite solar cell was prepared by Miyasaka et al. in a mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cell using lead halide perovskite as a light absorber/sensitizer. Since then, different perovskite film preparation methods and crystallization methods have been reported. These include vapor-assisted solution processing (VASP), physical vapor deposition (PVD), single step method and sequential deposition method.

Among solution processed methods, single-step deposition of the perovskite film uses a mixture of PbX2 and CH3NH3X (X = Cl, Br or I) from a common solvent such as γ-butyrolactone, dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). This method results in poor surface coverage and uncontrolled morphological variations which lead to low photovoltaic performance. Therefore, the sequential deposition method was developed to gain a better control of crystal formation and the growth mechanism of the perovskite phase. In this method, lead iodide (PbI2) is first deposited by spin coating from dimethylformamide onto a mesoporous TiO2 film and then dipped in a solution of methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) (CH3NH3I) in isopropanol which leads to the formation of the perovskite film penetrating the mesoporous TiO2 film. However, the morphology of the perovskite film depends upon the reaction kinetics between PbI2 and CH3NH3I while crystallization of perovskite happens simultaneously. Local concentration of MAI, crystallization temperature and pre-wetting have a great impact on the perovskite crystal size, which can be used to control the grain size and roughness of the perovskite film prepared from the sequential method.
The morphology of the perovskite film is one of the critical factors for device performance. The perovskite morphology can be changed using additives or post treatment by exposing the perovskite film to moisture and controlling the reaction kinetics between lead iodide and methyl ammonium iodide. Im et al. used H2O or HBr(aq) as an additive in a CH3NH3PbBr3/DMF precursor solution to grow a compact and dense perovskite film on a mesoporous TiO2 film. Wu et al. used H2O as an additive in a PbI2 precursor to increase the quality of the perovskite film by reducing the number of pin holes. Bert et al. showed that the performance of perovskite solar cells does not decrease by adding some water into the perovskite precursor solution. Several other additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), and ammonium chloride have been used in the perovskite precursor solution to improve film quality by reducing the perovskite crystallization rate during spin coating.
Post treatment was done by exposing the prepared perovskite films under controlled moisture conditions. It was reported that water molecules with controlled humidity during the fabrication of the perovskite films assist the growth of a larger grain with less defect density for higher device performance. However, there are also reports that show water molecules are detrimental to the perovskite film which dissociates CH3NH3PbI3 into lead iodide and methyl ammonium iodide with reduced photovoltaic performance. Therefore, water is an important factor in perovskite film formation with dual roles. Depending on the amount of water molecules, they can assist growth, but also can cause degradation in the perovskite phase. It is necessary to study the role of water molecules and find the optimal conditions for water in perovskite film formation in order to further improve perovskite solar cell efficiency.
Although the pin hole free perovskite films have been made using water as a dopant in the PbI2 precursor, to the best of our knowledge water effects on perovskite crystallization and grain size have not been reported. In this work, we studied the crystallization of the perovskite film prepared from MAI solution with different concentrations of water by the sequential deposition method. The perovskite films were prepared by dipping PbI2 coated films in 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water in MAI solution. Perovskite films prepared from 5% water in MAI solution show the highest crystallinity with the largest grain size. The perovskite solar cells prepared from 5% water in MAI solution show the highest device efficiency of 12.42% with Jsc = 20.65 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.94 V and FF = 0.64 in forward scan at a scanning rate of 0.5 V s−1. As the amount of water increased from 0% to 5% in MAI solution, the crystallization of the perovskite phase increased leading to the highest device performance. However, when the amount of water increased from 5% to 7%, the perovskite films turn yellow and device performance decreased.

Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and mesoporous TiO2 were purchased from Dyesol. PbI2 was purchased from Acros organics. FTO coated glass substrates were purchased from Hartford Glass Company.


Perovskite solar cells were fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated substrates (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm). FTO substrates were etched using zinc powder and diluted in hydrochloric acid (0.1 ml HCl in 1 ml DI water by volume). Substrates were subsequently rinsed with DI water. All etched substrates were then cleaned by detergent water, DI water, acetone and isopropanol by sonication for 25 min each. Substrates were then dried using nitrogen flow, followed by plasma cleaning for 20 min in the presence of oxygen.

Compact layers of TiO2 prepared from its precursor (titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 75 wt.% solution in 2-propanol) solutions of 0.15 M and 0.3 M were coated onto cleaned substrates using spin coating at 4500 rpm for 30 s. A compact layer of TiO2 coated substrates was then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The substrates were cooled down to room temperature and a mesoporous TiO2 film with particle size 20 nm was spin coated at 5500 rpm on top of a compact layer of TiO2. Substrates were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min, and then cooled down to room temperature. Substrates were then treated by dipping them in TiCl4 (25 mM) solution for 30 min at 70 °C, followed by rinsing with DI water, ethanol and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min.
PbI2 solution (462 mg ml−1 in DMF) was prepared by overnight stirring at 70 °C. The solution was then spin coated on top of a mesoporous TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. To form a perovskite layer, the PbI2 films were dipped in CH3NH3I solution (10 mg ml−1 in IPA) with 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water without pre-wetting, followed by immediately spin coating at 5000 rpm for 10 s outside the glove box. The films were then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. Spiro-OMeTAD was used as a hole transport layer, prepared by mixing 72.3 mg of (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene) (spiro-MeOTAD), 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Spiro-OMeTAD was spin coated on top of the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, silver (Ag) was then deposited as the top electrode in a high vacuum chamber using thermal evaporation.

An Agilent 8453 UV-VIS spectrophotometer G1103A was used to record the absorbance spectra of perovskite films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded on a Rigaku Smartlab system. An Agilent SPM 5500 atomic force microscope equipped with a MAC III controller (three lock-in amplifiers) was used to map topography and surface potential (SP) with a multi75Eg budget sensor tip illuminated with white light. The tip's first resonance (f1) frequency of 67 kHz was fed into the first lock-in amplifier (LIA1). The vertical tip–sample separation was controlled from LIA1 which provided the error in the amplitude signal at first resonance (f1) to the servo. This first lock in amplifier was used for topographic and phase imaging, while the second frequency (f2) at 5 kHz using a second lock-in amplifier (LIA2) gave KPFM measurement. Topography interference with surface potential measurement was avoided with SP vs. z spectroscopy. The constant SP at different Z values reveals the independence of SP on surface topography. The fabricated perovskite solar cells were characterized by current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. The current density (J) and voltage (V) were measured using an Agilent 4155C under illumination of a solar simulator (Xenon lamp, Newport) with an intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The intensity of illumination was calibrated using a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) photodetector (S1133 14-01) to set the distance between the solar cell and the solar simulator. All solar cells with an area of 0.16 cm2 were characterized under the same conditions with 0.5 V s−1 scan rate in forward with 0 to 1 V and reverse scan sweeping from 1 to 0 1 V at a relative humidity of 40% under ambient conditions.


Transient photovoltage (TPV) was performed using a dye laser (532 nm) coupled with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) to create a short transient in the cell. The transient optical excitation was achieved by focusing a pump laser pulse on the device generated by a OBB's Model OL-4300 Nitrogen Laser (a crisp pulse at 337 nanometers) – a Model 1011 dye laser as the excitation source (repetition rate ∼4 Hz, pulse duration <1 ns). The transient photovoltage was measured with high impedance (1 MΩ) of the oscilloscope to operate the device under open circuit conditions. The generated transients were recorded using an Agilent MSO-X-4154A mixed oscilloscope (1.5 GHz, 5 Gsa s−1). The pulse width of the dye laser was measured on the oscilloscope through the response of the photodiode (rise time less than 1 ns, spectral range 280–1100 nm) as an excitation source to the device. The obtained data were fitted with the mono-exponential decaying function to calculate charge carrier life time of the devices.



Fig. 1 shows UV-Vis spectra of perovskite films prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water in MAI solution. The films of lead iodide (PbI2) were coated onto a ca. 600 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer from 462 mg ml−1 of PbI2 solution in DMF. The PbI2 coated films were dried at 70 °C for 30 min on a hot plate. After this, the films were dipped in MAI solution with 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water for 50 s. The as-cast films were annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. All the films were prepared under exactly the same conditions as followed during device fabrication. The CH3NH3PbI3 film shows a broad absorption across the visible region with two prominent peaks at 470 nm and 790 nm in absorption spectra. The absorbance of the perovskite film increases with increasing water concentration in MAI solution from 0% to 1%, 3%, 5% and is the highest for 5% water in MAI solution. This could be attributed to the fact that 5% of water is just enough to solvate the methylammonium and provides great diffusion mobility to form the perovskite phase. The absorbance of the perovskite film is the highest for films prepared from 5% water in MAI solution. Previous report showed that crystallization of perovskite happens when exposed to moisture as the water solvates the methylammonium and provides high diffusion mobility to form the perovskite phase. To further understand the role of water in the MAI solution, the concentration of water was further increased from 5% to 7% and the absorbance decreased significantly. The reason is that the excess amount (>5%) of water in MAI solution can dissociate CH3NH3PbI3 into PbI2 and CH3NH3I. This is further confirmed by the measurements of XRD and AFM that will be discussed later.

The perovskite crystal structure can be described by the general formula ABX3 where A and B are cations and X is an anion. The perovskite crystal structure discussed here is CH3NH3PbI3 where A = CH3NH3, B = Pb and X = I. These crystals are held together by ionic interactions between the organic and inorganic part and by a hydrogen bond. XRD patterns were recorded to understand the effect of water in the MAI solution. Dip coating was done outside the glove box with a relative humidity of 40%. Fig. 2 and 3 show XRD patterns of annealed and unannealed perovskite films prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water in the MAI solution. The XRD samples were prepared under the same conditions as for UV-Vis absorption measurements. The strong Bragg peaks at 14.08°, 28.41°, 31.85°, and 43.19° are assigned to (110), (220), (310), and (330) of CH3NH3PbI3. These structures correspond to the tetragonal I4cm crystal structure of halide perovskite with high crystallinity. The peak at 12.12° is assigned to (001) of PbI2 and corresponds to incomplete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. This PbI2 phase was previously reported by using the sequential deposition method.
Remarkably, the diffractograms (Fig. 2) do not show significant increase in the PbI2 phase for perovskite films when prepared with the water content increasing from 0%, 1%, 3%, to 5% in the MAI solution. However, a strong PbI2 peak was observed with the perovskite film prepared from 7% water in the MAI solution. A methylammonium lead iodide perovskite film is formed with the intercalation of methylammonium ions into the lattice space of PbI2. If the film is exposed to excess water, dissolution of the polar organic CH3NH3+ in the perovskite structure occurs that results in dissociation of perovskite into PbI2 and CH3NH3I. The XRD peaks of annealed perovskite films prepared from 1%, 3% and 5% water are higher than those in the 0% water in MAI solution. Crystallinity of perovskite increases after increasing the water concentration up to 5% in the MAI solution. The (110) peak of the perovskite phase prepared from 5% water increases by 1.62 (Table 1) times that from 0% water in MAI solution. This shows that an optimum amount of water facilitates crystallization of perovskite films in the (110) plane. It is shown that the interaction between MAPbI3 and water is critical as moisture has been shown to affect the crystallization dynamics and growth of perovskite films. It was found that crystallinity of perovskite increased when the perovskite films were exposed to water molecules under high humidity conditions. Water molecules can penetrate across the perovskite structure to form partly reactive phases [CH3NH3PbI3.H2O and (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O]. These reactive phases are metastable forms that spontaneously dehydrate in air forming perovskite phases. These hydrated phases are formed due to water incorporation into the perovskite lattice by the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and lattice iodides, as well as from hydrogen bonding interaction between MA cations and water molecules. Thus, adding water as additives expanded the volume of perovskite films. Water can improve the growth of perovskite films from the interaction between H2O and MAPbI3, such as hydrogen bonding interaction. This is also supported by AFM topography images discussed later which show increase in the roughness of films prepared by adding water into MAI solution suggesting volume expansion leading to the formation of large grains of perovskite.

In addition, lower boiling point and higher vapor pressure of water speed up the crystallization of perovskite with larger crystals. Our XRD spectra show that the perovskite film formation is facilitated by adding 5% water in MAI solution. However, higher percentage (>5%) of water in MAI solution retards perovskite formation. We also found that when the water concentration is increased beyond 10%, the film is completely covered with PbI2. Therefore, water helps to speed up the formation of perovskite crystallization with the largest grains while adding 5% water in MAI solution. However, it slows the formation of perovskite by adding water beyond 5% in MAI solution by using the sequential deposition method. Therefore, when there is a sufficient amount of water molecules in the solution, the perovskite readily forms bonding with a single molecule of water which crystallizes upon exposure to air. By comparing the FWHM of the (110) peak of the perovskite phase in Table 1, it can be seen that the perovskite film prepared with 5% water in MAI solution has the narrowest FWHM value (0.379) indicating the highest crystallinity of the perovskite phase in the (110) plane. However, the FWHM of the (220) phase of perovskite does not change significantly because of the higher surface and interfacial energy in the (220) plane.
To further understand the role of adding water into the MAI solution on perovskite crystallization, XRD spectra were recorded on unannealed perovskite films made by dipping PbI2 films in 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water in the MAI solution. The XRD measurements of unannealed samples were performed to exclude the annealing effects on crystallization and investigate only the effects of adding water into the MAI solution on the perovskite crystallization. Fig. 3 shows that there is no observable change in XRD spectra by increasing the water concentration from 0% to 3% in the MAI solution. However, the perovskite phase (110) increases with increasing the water content from 3% to 5% and 7% in MAI solution. This is in agreement with the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak as shown in Table 2. The FWHM of the perovskite phase is the lowest for the perovskite film prepared from 5% (FWHM = 0.394) and 7% (FWHM = 0.391) water content in the MAI solution. The perovskite phase (110)/PbI2 crystallinity (001) ratio for 5% water content is higher than that of 7% water content. Therefore, the perovskite film prepared from 5% water content in the MAI solution has the highest (0.93) perovskite/PbI2 crystallinity ratio, indicating that the largest amount of PbI2 is converted into the perovskite phase with 5% water content. This is similar to the increase in crystallinity of the annealed perovskite film prepared from 5% water in the MAI solution. The addition of 5% water can facilitate the reaction between the PbI2 phase and methyl ammonium iodide and form the metastable monohydrate phase that instantaneously converts to perovskite when exposed to air. When the water content was further increased from 5% to 7% in the MAI solution, the PbI2 (001) peak also increases significantly. This is due to the dissolution of the perovskite with excess water present in the MAI solution.

Therefore, XRD spectra of unannealed and annealed perovskite films demonstrate that 5% is an optimal amount of water that can help to crystallize the perovskite phase in the (110) plane. The ratio between the peaks of (110) and (220) in perovskite increases with higher content of water in the MAI solution. The higher value in the (110) plane suggests more grain growth in the (110) plane. This may be due to lower surface and interfacial energy in the (110) plane.
To further study the effects of dipping PbI2 films in the MAI solution with 0%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% water concentrations and understand distinct changes in absorption spectra and XRD patterns, the morphology of such films was characterized by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). All AFM samples were prepared under the same processing conditions as the UV-Vis and XRD measurements. Fig. 4(a–e) show AFM images of annealed perovskite films prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water in the MAI solution. The AFM images show that the grain size of perovskite films increases from 171 nm for 0% water (Fig. 4a) to 630 nm for 5% water (Fig. 4d) in the MAI solution. This is further confirmed by the topography line profile (Fig. S1a) in the ESI. However, further increase of water concentration to 7% (Fig. 4e) provides excess water that causes dissolution of large crystals, leading to an average grain size of 330 nm. There is a slight increase of grain size in perovskite films made from 0% water (171 nm, Fig. 4a) to 1% water (200 nm, Fig. 4b). After increasing the water concentration to 3% (Fig. 4c), the grain size increases to 358 nm, which can be seen in Fig. 4f with the average particle size calculated using Pico View software and plotted against water concentration. Increase in grain size with higher water concentration may be due to the combined effects of crystallization of the perovskite film by the water molecule and annealing. During crystallization of perovskite films, the average size of the remaining grains (Fig. 4d) increases by the motion of grain boundaries resulting in shrinkage and elimination of small grains, which reduces the total grain boundary area. This is most clearly seen for perovskite films prepared by dipping the PbI2 layer in the 5% water MAI solution. The perovskite phase undergoes a crystallization process with large grain size and volume expansion after increasing the water concentration to 5% in the MAI solution, which is similar to the crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 under 90% RH reported by Jeffrey et al. This will decrease the total number of trap sites and defect density along the grain boundary and reduce the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which will be demonstrated using transient photovoltage measurement later.
AFM images of unannealed perovskite films were also recorded to understand the role of water in the MAI solution on the formation of perovskite. Fig. 5 shows AFM topography images of unannealed perovskite films prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water in the MAI solution. The reason for measuring the morphology of unannealed perovskite films is to exclude the effect of annealing on the grain size but only study the effect of adding water into the MAI solution. The grain size of the perovskite film increases from 108 nm for 0% (Fig. 5a) to 148 nm for 1% (Fig. 5b) and to 220 nm for 3% (Fig. 5c) water. This is further confirmed by the topography line profile (Fig. S1b) in the ESI. However, it increases significantly when the water concentration increases from 3% to 5% and 7%. The grain size of perovskite films increases from 220 nm for 3% (Fig. 5c) water to 391 nm for 5% (Fig. 5d) water, but decreased to 346 nm for 7% (Fig. 5e) water in the MAI solution. Fig. 5f further confirms the increase of the average grain size with higher water content up to 5% but it decreased when the water content reached 7%. The increase in grain size compared to the 0% water perovskite film may be due to the volume expansion during the crystal growth from PbI2 to perovskite by the intercalation of CH3NH3+ as well as rearrangement of the aggregated structure of PbI2 driven by minimizing the grain boundary energy. Similar results have been obtained with SEM images shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI. The SEM images show that perovskite films have the largest grain size after adding 5% water in MAI solution. The morphology of perovskite films with 0% H2O and 1% H2O in MAI looks similar except for more visible gaps in the perovskite film from 0% H2O in MAI solution. After increasing the water concentration to 3% in MAI solution, the grain size of the perovskite film was found to increase. Such an improvement in morphology has also been shown using different additives. The grain size reached the largest at 5% water, and then decreased with 7% water in MAI solution.

Fig. 6 shows the nanoscale surface potential distribution of perovskite films prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water content in the MAI solution. The surface potential distributions were acquired from KPFM images shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). The surface potential of perovskite films prepared from 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water content in the MAI solution were higher compared to 0% water in MAI solution. The average surface potential of perovskite films increases with increasing the amount of H2O in MAI solution till 5% and decreases with increasing beyond 5% H2O in MAI solution. This is due to the reduced surface defects which act as traps for electrons caused by dangling bonds. This may be due to doping of water during perovskite film formation which helps in reconstruction of the perovskite surface reducing structural defects in the surface. It was previously reported that the origin of dangling bonds is due to the exposed iodine atoms in the perovskite film.

Fig. 7 shows current density–voltage (J–V) curves of perovskite solar cells with the device structure of FTO/c-TiO2 mesoporous-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Ag using 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% water content in the MAI solution. The perovskite films were deposited by the two step method: first PbI2 films were spin coated and dried. Second, the films were dipped in 10 mg ml−1 MAI solution which contained different concentrations (0–7%) of water by IPA volume. The device performance of prepared cells was measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 simulated solar irradiation with a humidity of 40%. The scan rate was kept constant for all devices with 0.5 V s−1. The cells were characterized both in forward and reverse scan (Fig. S4 in the ESI) due to the J–V hysteresis and degradation of the devices while switching the voltage.
As shown in Table 3, after adding 1%, 3% and 5% water into the MAI solution, the average photovoltaic efficiencies were improved and reached the highest at 12.42% and 11.74% from forward and reverse scan, respectively, at 5% water based devices. This is higher than the average efficiencies at 9.04% and 9.25% for perovskite films prepared from 0% water in the MAI solution from forward and reverse scan, respectively. The improvements in short circuit current density (Jsc) in Table 3 are due to the increase in absorbance (Fig. 1a). Increase in the fill factor (FF) is due to the formation of high quality films with large grain size. Increase in open circuit voltage (Voc) is caused by the increase in grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite film which reduces the recombination by decreasing trap states and defects within the grain boundary. This is consistent with the charge carrier lifetime obtained from transient photovoltage measurements in Fig. 9. Such an increase in Voc was also observed by Eperon et al. by exposing the perovskite film to humidity for post moisture treatment. Perovskite devices prepared from 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% water in the MAI solution show increased photovoltaic performance compared to that prepared from 0% water in the MAI solution.

It can be seen that the efficiency increased when the water concentration increased from 0% to 5% in the MAI solution and decreased when 7% of water was added to the MAI solution. A number of devices were prepared and similar efficiencies were found. Water can weakly bind to methylammonium molecules and form the reversible hydrated phase within perovskite, which quickly forms dehydrated perovskite upon exposure to air. An optimal amount of water can solubilize the methylammonium and other components, providing them higher mobility and allowing excess methylammonium to be removed, healing the perovskite structure and fulfilling the deficits and any trap states. Decrease in the trap states results in less non-radiative trap-mediated recombination. Hence, adding an optimal amount of water to the MAI solution leads to improved Voc, FF and hence overall device performance. The decrease in performance by excess water content is caused by the dissolution of the perovskite phase to PbI2 and CH3NH3I.

Fig. 8 shows transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements of perovskite solar cells prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% water in the MAI solution by using the sequential deposition method. The short lived photocurrent is generated by a nanosecond pulse of a dye laser incident on solar cells under short circuit conditions (by a very low resistor at 20 Ω). No background light was applied when measuring TPC. This is the reason when the pulse laser was off, the TPC decays reach zero for all samples. Charge transport time was obtained by fitting the decay function with mono-exponential equation ΔI0 exp(−t/τ) where τ is the charge carrier life time. It was found that the values of charge transport time (Table 4) are 1.39 μs, 1.54 μs, 1.64 μs, 0.998 μs and 1.88 μs for perovskite solar cells prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% water in the MAI solution respectively. The charge transport time of the perovskite film prepared from 5% water in MAI solution is faster than 0% water in MAI solution showing efficient charge extraction. This is in agreement with the increase in the fill factor as shown in Table 3. However, when the water concentration is increased to 7%, the charge transport time becomes longer which may be caused by the dissociation of CH3NH3PbI3 into PbI2 and CH3NH3I. All the devices show shorter charge transport time than charge carrier life time (recombination time) that will be discussed below, making efficient charge extraction in the prepared perovskite solar cells.

Fig. 9 shows transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements of perovskite solar cells prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% water in the MAI solution by using the sequential deposition method. The cells were kept under open circuit conditions using high input impedance (1 MΩ) to approximate open circuit. The cells were constantly illuminated by background light with an intensity of 1.5 suns from an external halogen lamp source. As the background light intensity is steady state at 1.5 suns, the TPV decay does not fall to zero level in Fig. 9. In addition, TPV curves do not decay to the same level in Fig. 9 as different solar cells have different open circuit voltage under steady state conditions. Charge carrier life times (Table 5) of 1.51 μs, 4.36 μs, 7.63 μs, 11.60 μs and 1.83 μs were found for perovskite solar cells prepared from 0%, 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% water in the MAI solution, respectively. Charge carrier lifetime was obtained by fitting the decay function with mono-exponential equation ΔVo exp(−t/τ) where τ is the charge carrier life time. The highest charge carrier life time of 11.6 μs was found for 5% water in MAI solution. This is consistent with the increase in Voc for 5% water in MAI solution in comparison to without water in MAI solution as shown in J–V curves. The longest carrier life time of the perovskite solar cell prepared from 5% water in MAI solution may be due to the formation of large grain size that reduces the trap charge density by reducing the total grain boundary area.

In summary, the water effects on the perovskite film crystallization and grain size have been studied. 5% by volume was found to be an optimal amount of water for crystallizing a perovskite film in the (110) plane that increased the grain size to three times of that prepared without water in the MAI solution. The increase in grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite film helps to reduce the recombination of charge carriers by decreasing the total grain boundary area, which was supported by transient photovoltage results. Transient photovoltage measurement shows a carrier life time of 11.6 μs for perovskite solar cells prepared from 5% water in MAI solution, which is longer than 7.01 μs for the device without any water. The perovskite film fabricated from 5% water content in the MAI solution exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency of 12.42% at forward scan with a scanning rate of 0.5 V s−1. The perovskite solar cells exhibited comparable power conversion efficiencies in forward and reverse scan with insignificant hysteresis. The results show that an optimal small amount of water into the MAI solution can facilitate perovskite crystal growth but any excess water can also cause degradation in perovskite solar cells. Our findings showed that 5% by volume water added to the MAI solution improved perovskite solar cells from 9.04% to 12.42%.
