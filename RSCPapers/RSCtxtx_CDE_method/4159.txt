Carbon-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without hole transport layer (HTL) have shown great prospect for practical applications because of their high stability and low cost. However, almost all of the carbon based PSCs reported so far are fabricated using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the electron transport layer (ETL) that requires a rather high-temperature sintering process (500 °C). Moreover, they also suffer from obvious voltage–current hysteresis and conspicuous performance decline under operating conditions. Herein, we report a new type of low-temperature all carbon based PSCs using solution-processed hexamethonium bromide (HMB)-doped C60 as ETL, which achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 16% without the above-mentioned hysteresis. It is shown that doping of C60 with HMB carries several outstanding advantages, including faster charge transport, enhanced electron mobility, and the decreased electron trap density. More encouraging is the remarkable stability of the PSCs fabricated with HMB-doped C60 ETL, which can maintain nearly 90% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 338 hours at their maximum power point under one sun illumination in ambient air.

Halide perovskites with a hybrid organic–inorganic stoichiometry have emerged as one of the most promising next-generation photovoltaic materials. Although the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has exceeded 23%, the expensive metal electrode (Au or Ag) and the ambient-unstable hole transport layers are unsuitable for the low-cost and large-scale production of PSCs and thus may obstruct their commercialization. Various technological approaches have been proposed to overcome the instability problem, among which carbon based PSCs may be one of the most promising attempts to improve the stability because of their stable carbon electrode and the removal of hole transport layer. The carbon based PSC devices using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the electron transport layer (ETL) commonly require an exceedingly high-temperature sintering process (about 500 °C). These cells also suffer from conspicuous decline of performance under light illumination, aside from the notorious current–voltage hysteresis. Although TiO2 has good electron selective properties, its sensitivity to the surface adsorption of oxygen and UV irradiation may restrict further improvements in efficiency and stability for PSCs.

Organic electron transport layers, such as fullerenes, have been verified to achieve effective electron extraction when interfaced with the perovskite layers, and they tend to reduce UV-induced degradation of the solar cell compared with the devices using inorganic TiO2 ETL. The buckminsterfullerene C60 exhibits an electron mobility of 1.6 cm2 V s−1, which is much higher than that of PCBM (6.1 × 10−2 cm2 V s−1). Vacuum-deposited C60 electron transport layers have been successfully used to replace TiO2 ETL, but the method of vacuum-deposition needs expensive equipment and great energy consumption. Solution-preparation of C60 ETL may be a desirable process for fabricating PSCs. But solution-processed C60 ETL requires to be made into a film thick enough to ensure complete coverage, which however may hinder electron transport. To improve the electron mobility and electrical conductivity of fullerenes, one of the most efficient ways is to utilize n-type doping technology by increasing the free electron concentration through efficient electron transfer from the n-type dopant to the host material.
Herein, we demonstrate an n-doped ETL by doping C60 with hexamethonium bromide (HMB) to fabricate efficient and stable all carbon based perovskite solar cells with the structure of ITO/HMB-doped C60/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon. We achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.03%, much higher than that of the PSC with non-doped C60 ETL (12.22%). Moreover, the PSCs-based on HMB-doped C60 maintained 81.9% of their initial PCE after storage in ambient condition at room temperature over 60 days and 90% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 338 hours in air directly determined from the maximum power point (MPP) tracking. Our result provides a new route to developing the quality electron transport layer for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

The wetting capability of the perovskite precursor solutions on the fullerene films plays an important role in shaping the morphology of the perovskite film. The C60 and PCBM we used are both commercially available fullerene materials. By comparing the contacting angles of dimethylformamide (DMF) on the C60 and PCBM films (Fig. 1a and b), we found that the contact angles of DMF on the C60 film is 11.8°, which is obviously lower than that of PCBM (43.9°), indicating the better spreadability of the perovskite precursor solution on the C60 film. The smaller contacting angle on the C60 film is propitious to form more smooth and compact perovskite layer, resulting in higher photovoltaic performance. Therefore, C60 was chosen as the ETL for PSCs, other than PCBM.

To improve the electron mobility and electrical conductivity, the C60 film was doped by HMB. Electron transfer between HMB and adjacent fullerene core during the film evolution induces in situ doping of the fullerene C60 thin-film (Fig. 1c). The incorporation of bromide anions into fullerene can induce effective n-doping via anion-induced electron transfer and thereby substantially increase film conductivity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra was performed to investigate the doping effect as shown in Fig. 1d. The HMB-doped (5.0%) C60 film exhibited a strong paramagnetic signal, suggesting the formation of fullerene radical anions. The atomic force microscope (AFM) topographic images of C60 and HMB-doped C60 films are presented in Fig. S2. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the HMB-doped C60 film is determined to be 1.02 nm, which is slightly smaller than that of the C60 film (1.10 nm). The smooth surface of the HMB-doped C60 film may be helpful for perovskite to grow densely and form a better charge contact at the perovskite/ETL interface (Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. S4, the transmittance of ITO/HMB-doped C60 film is nearly 90% from 600 to 800 nm. Notably, C60 film displays lower transmittance in the region of UV radiation (<400 nm), suggesting the potential as UV-blocking layer to decrease the proportion of UV in the solar spectrum, resulting in enhancing the photostability of the PSCs.
We fabricated PSCs using the C60 and HMB-doped C60 films as ETLs with the all carbon based device structure of ITO/C60(HMB-doped)/MAPbI3/carbon. The device configurations of the all carbon based PSCs are shown in Fig. S8. It can be seen that the thickness of ETLs is about 45 nm, which can efficiently ensure complete coverage on the ITO substrates. Compact and uniform MAPbI3 film was fabricated on the C60 or HMB-doped C60 films by using Lewis base adduct method as shown in Fig. S8. According to previous procedures, carbon electrode was prepared by directly doctor blading a commercial carbon paste on the perovskite layer, and the thickness is about 20 μm.
Shown in Fig. S9 are the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the perovskite solar cells with different HMB dopant amounts (W/O, 2.5%, 5.0%, 10.0%) in the C60 ETLs measured at the reverse scan under the AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Compared with the device based on the pristine C60 ETL (W/O HMB dopant), the photovoltaic performance of the devices with different HMB dopant amounts (2.5%, 5.0%, 10.0%) in the C60 ETLs are all enhanced (Table S1). In particular, the HMB-doped C60 (5.0%) device exhibits the best photovoltaic performance, but doping even more HMB (10.0%) actually stalls the promotion of the device photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best PSCs by using C60 or HMB-doped C60 (5.0%) ETLs measured with both reverse and forward scan under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. As shown in Table 1, the PSCs fabricated with HMB-doped C60 ETL showed the champion PCE of 16.03% under the reverse scan. It is clear that the device with the HMB-doped C60 ETL displays free of hysteresis, which may be ascribe to the efficient charge extraction from perovskite to HMB-doped C60 according to the photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Fig. S11). The device based on solution processed C60 without doping showed the champion PCE of 12.22% under the reverse. The improved performance of the PSC with HMB-doped C60 ETL is mainly attributed to a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), which are associated with the doping effect of HMB in C60.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the best-performing device based on HMB-doped C60 and C60 ETLs are shown in Fig. S12 and Table 1, corresponding to the integrated Jsc of 22.49 mA cm−2 and 19.76 mA cm−2, respectively, in good agreement with the measured Jsc from the J–V curves. The best device with the HMB-doped C60 ETL also achieved a steady-state efficiency of 15.91% as shown in Fig. S12 and Table 1, which checks well with the free of hysteresis and verifies the PCE value from the J–V curves. To further confirm the reproducibility of the PSCs based on HMB-doped C60 ETLs, more individual devices are fabricated and the distribution statistics of the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S13 and Table S3. It is clear that the photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs using HMB-doped C60 ETL show a very narrow distribution. The good device reproducibility is probably due to the more outstanding HMB-doped C60/perovskite interface.
Nyquist plots at bias of 0.80 V of the PSCs based on the C60 or HMB-doped C60 ETLs under AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 3a. The horizontal intercept and well-defined semicircles of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at different negative bias voltages under AM 1.5G illumination stands for series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) (Fig. 3b and c). The Rs values of the PSCs device with the HMB-doped C60 ETL are clearly lower than those of the PSCs device with the C60 ETL. This suggests a better ETL/perovskite interface contact and the reduced carrier recombination after doping HMB in C60, leading to an improved FF and Jsc in the HMB-doped C60 device. The Rct values of the PSCs device with the HMB-doped C60 ETL are also evidently lower than those of the PSCs device with the C60 ETL. The reduced Rct results in a significant increase of FF in the HMB-doped device. The well-defined semicircles of the EIS at different negative bias voltages in the dark can be used to estimate recombination resistance (Rrec) of the devices (Fig. 3d). Compared with the device with the C60 ETL, the HMB-doped C60 device shows a higher Rrec, which makes the HMB-doped device to have a higher Voc.
Aside from the EIS measurements, the dynamics of electron transport and recombination in PSCs can also be studied by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) (Fig. 4). The PSCs with HMB-doped C60 ETL shows lower electron transport time (τtr) and higher charge recombination time (τrec) than that with C60 ETL without doping, indicating the faster electron transport rate and lower recombination rate at the HMB-doped C60/MAPbI3 interface (Fig. 4a and b). The electron diffusion coefficients (Dn) in PSCs with HMB-doped C60 ETL is higher than that with C60 ETL, suggesting that the HMB-doped C60 ETL is more beneficial for electron transport than the C60 ETL without doping (Fig. 4c). The electron diffusion length (LD) of the PSCs based on HMB-doped C60 ETL is longer than that based on C60 ETL (Fig. 4d). Lower τtr, higher τrec and longer LD of the PSCs based on HMB-doped C60 ETL are propitious to improved Jsc, and higher Dn makes for improved FF compared with that based on C60 ETL without doping, which can be attributed to the doping effect of HMB in C60.
The dark J–V measurement was used to compare the trap-state density (nTraps) and mobilities (μ) of the charge carriers in the MAPbI3 with the electron-only devices (ITO/C60(HMB-doped)/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag).Fig. 5 shows the dark J–V curves of the devices based on HMB-doped C60 and C60 ETLs. The nTraps in the perovskite crystals is estimated from the eqn (1)
(1)
The voltage of trap filled limit (VTFL) of the MAPbI3 films deposited on C60 ETLs with or without doping are 0.84 and 1.03 V, respectively. The nTraps of MAPbI3 with HMB-doped C60 ETL is 9.93 × 1015 cm−3, which is lower than that of MAPbI3 deposited on C60 ETL without doping (1.22 × 1016 cm−3). The lower electron trap-state density is beneficial to improve photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. At the higher bias voltages above 2 V, the dark J–V curve moves to the space charge limited conduction (SCLC) regime. In this regime, the mobilities can be extracted from the SCLC region following the Mott–Gurney relation (2)
(2)
The μ of MAPbI3 with HMB-doped C60 ETL (37.65 cm2 V−1 s−1) is obviously higher than that of MAPbI3 deposited on C60 ETL (13.39 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating that the HMB-doped C60 ETL exhibits stronger charge extraction. Together, the reduced carrier recombination, faster electron transport and stronger charge extraction can nicely explain the enhancement of photovoltaic performance of the PSCs due to the HMB doping.
Furthermore, we investigated the photo- and humidity stability of the PSC devices based on HMB-doped C60 ETLs without encapsulation. The long-term stability of PSCs is closely related to the ETL/perovskite interface binding strength and interfacial charge accumulation during operation. The PSC devices based on HMB-doped C60 maintained 81.9% of their initial PCE after storage in ambient condition (RH 20–30%) at room temperature for over 60 days, whereas those with C60 retained 78.7% of their initial efficiency (Fig. 6a). The photo-stability of the PSCs with the C60 and the HMB-doped C60 ETLs under continuous one sun illumination (with a 420 nm cutoff UV filter) at MPP tracking was also examined (Fig. 6b). The device with the HMB-doped C60 ETL without any encapsulation retained 90% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 338 hours and retained 80% for 505 hours in air with a relative humidity of 20–30%, as directly determined from the MPP tracking. By contrast, the device with the pristine C60 ETL retained only 72.6% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 200 hours and only 62.1% for 225 hours. The more outstanding photo- and humidity stability of the device with the HMB-doped C60 can be plausibly ascribed to the lower trap density of MAPbI3 interfaced with the HMB-doped C60 ETL (Fig. 5), which could more easily resist the erosion of moisture and light.
Up to now, almost all of the previously reported high-efficiency PSCs are mainly demonstrated based on a very small active device area (from 0.03 to 0.15 cm2). Even the alleged large-area (1 cm2) PSC devices are still unable to meet the requirements of commercialization. To further gauge the utility value of a solar cell, it is essential to examine larger-area devices. To this end, we prepared carbon electrode by doctor blading, which is easily to scale up. As shown in Fig. 7, the 4 cm2 carbon-based PSCs achieves an outstanding PCE of 10.48%, with a Voc of 1.02 V, Jsc of 20.13 mA cm−2, FF of 0.511 under the reverse scan. To our knowledge, this is also the best performance of carbon-based PSCs at the device area of 4 cm2.

In conclusion, we reported a new type of low-temperature all carbon based perovskite solar cells using solution processed HMB-doped C60 as ETL with the device structure of ITO/HMB-doped C60/MAPbI3/carbon. Such solar cells have achieved power conversion efficiencies of over 16% without hysteresis, which compare favorably with that of the PSC based on solution processed C60 without doping (12.22% with hysteresis). The excellent device performance is attributed to the outstanding advantage of HMB-doped C60, including a smoother surface, faster electron transport, lower electron recombination, enhanced electron mobility, and the decreased electron trap-state density of the perovskite layer. Moreover, the devices exhibit good humidity stability and photo-stability, which maintained 81.9% of their initial PCE after storage in ambient condition at room temperature over 60 days and 90% of their initial performance after continuous operation for 338 hours in air directly determined from the MPP tracking. Finally, the large-area PSC device (4 cm2) fabricated by employing HMB-doped C60 as ETL also achieved a considerable high PCE of over 10%, again the highest value for this kind of PSCs. This study provides a feasible route for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable all carbon based perovskite solar cells at low temperature.


ITO glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω cm−2) were purchased from ShenZhen South China Xiang Cheng Science & Technology Company Limited. C60 was homemade. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (99%) was purchased from Aladdin. HMB was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-Chlorophenol (98%) was purchased from Acros. CH3NH3I (99%) was purchased from Dyesol. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) was purchased from Aladdin. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) was purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd. The carbon paste was purchased from Guangzhou Seaside Technology Co., Ltd.


ITO glass substrates were cleaned by using ultrasonic method with DI water, acetone and isopropanol for 20 min each. After drying with nitrogen gas, the ITO glass substrates were exposed to UVO treatment for 20 min in order to improve the surface energy. A C60 solution (15 mg ml−1) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was spin-cast at 3000 rpm for 30 s on the ITO substrate and dried at 100 °C for 10 min. The HMB-doped C60 film was also tested by mixed 2.5%, 5%, 10.0% molar ratio HMB with the C60 solution (15 mg ml−1) in the presence of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 2-chlorophenol mixed solvent (volume ratio 3:1). The perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) active layer was fabricated on the C60 or HMB-doped C60 films by using Lewis base adduct method. To prepare a CH3NH3I·PbI2·DMSO (molar ratio 1:1:1) adduct solution, 159 mg of CH3NH3I, 461 mg of PbI2 and 78 mg of DMSO were dissolved in 600 mg of DMF solution in a N2 condition with stirring overnight. The prepared solution was deposited by spin-coating on the C60 or HMB-doped C60 films at 4000 rpm for 20 s with 0.5 ml of diethyl ether dripping method during the process, which causes rapid vaporization of DMF. After that, the perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to make a uniform and dense MAPbI3 film. The carbon paste was bladed on the perovskite film directly and baked at 100 °C for 20 min.


The EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature using a JEOL FA-200 EPR spectrometer. The contacting angles of DMF on the C60 and HMB-doped C60 films were measured using a contact angle measurement (OCA 15pro). The AFM height images were obtained with a Bruker Multimode 8 atomic force microscope in tapping mode. The cross-sectional and surface images of the ETL films, perovskite films and the fabricated perovskite solar cells were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL J-7800F). The crystalline structure of the perovskite films was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) on a Rigaku D/max-2500 VB2+/PC diffractometer in the 2θ range of 10–60° at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. The optical property of the C60 and HMB-doped C60 films on the ITO glass was determined by using the transmission spectra recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Rerkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS). Photoluminescence spectra were obtained on the Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980 with the range of wavelength from 700 nm to 850 nm by exciting at 470 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A) with the Keithley 2400 Source Meter under AM 1.5G. The J–V curves were measured in an ambient atmosphere with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured by a EQE system (Oriel instruments) with 150 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) as a source of monochromatic light. The photo-stability test at continuous MPP operation under 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G illumination was carried out in an ambient atmosphere by using an Electrochemical Workstation (Zennium 400147) to fix the voltage at VMPP and then track the current output. The VMPP at maximum power point was determined from the J–V curve. A 420 nm cutoff UV-filter was applied in front of the perovskite solar cells during the photo-stability tests. The EIS measurements were measured by applying a bias of the open-circuit voltage with frequencies ranging from 106 Hz to 100 Hz. The IMPS and IMVS measurements were recorded using a CIMPS system (PP211, Zahner).
