Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly evolved over the past decade to become a photovoltaic technology on the cusp of commercialization. In the process, numerous fabrication strategies have been explored with the goal of simultaneously optimizing for device efficiency, stability, and scalability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have proven to be effective tools for the fabrication of various components of PSCs. This review article examines the application of ALD and CVD for the deposition and modification of charge transport layers, passivation layers, absorber materials, encapsulants, and electrodes. It outlines the use of these vapor deposition techniques in state-of-the-art, multi-junction solar cell devices, and also contains a discussion of the stability of metal halide perovskite materials under ALD and CVD conditions based on in situ characterization reported in literature. This article concludes with insights into future ALD and CVD research directions that could be undertaken to further aid the deployment of PSCs in emerging solar photovoltaic markets.

Solar electricity generation continues to grow worldwide as a clean and renewable solution to meet growing energy demand. Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging, thin-film photovoltaic technology with power conversion efficiencies that are now approaching those of more established silicon-based systems. PSCs are well suited for both traditional module designs as well as multi-junction and flexible devices which are of interest in emerging solar markets. Commercial-scale production of high performance PSCs will require low-cost, scalable fabrication techniques that also provide nanoscale control over film properties. In this review, we show that chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and the related atomic layer deposition (ALD) are versatile synthesis tools with the potential to meet these demands. In addition, the review highlights prospective research directions for ALD and CVD applied to PSCs and introduces a framework that may inform the application of these methods to other emerging energy and optoelectronic technologies.


Over the course of the past decade, metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as an exciting, new thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology. They have garnered a tremendous amount of attention from both the academic research community and solar industry because of their rapid rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to over 25% in such a short time span. This outstanding progress is the result of significant advancements in the manufacture of high-quality perovskite absorbers and the design of novel contact layers and device architectures. It also stems from a better fundamental understanding of the physics that govern the optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite materials. Yet, significant strides still need to be made in order for PSCs to become a viable commercial PV technology. Further improvements in efficiency will come from optimization of perovskite/contact interfaces and better light management. In addition, the long-term stability of devices must be improved by minimizing internal and external degradation pathways exacerbated by heat and light. Lastly, the implementation of low-cost and scalable deposition techniques will continue to drive down the cost of PSCs. In the last several years, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and the related process of atomic layer deposition (ALD) have emerged as valuable fabrication tools to address these future research goals.

CVD is a technique used to obtain thin solid films by reactions between one or more precursors either in the gas phase or on the surface of a substrate, usually in the presence of some form of reaction initiator – heat, high energy radiation, or plasma. Schematics for two types of CVD processes that have been applied to PSCs are depicted in Fig. 1a. In one-step deposition, all precursors are introduced into the reaction chamber simultaneously using an inert gas flow (e.g. argon or nitrogen). The species in the gas phase migrate toward the substrate and chemisorb to the surface. Afterwards, they decompose, and byproducts are purged out of the reactor. Surface reaction and diffusion of the adsorbed molecules lead to nucleation and formation of each layer of the desired film. Partial decomposition and reaction of the precursors in the gas phase can also occur. In the two-step process, an initial layer of one precursor is first deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD) (e.g. evaporation), followed by the introduction of a second precursor that reacts with and interdiffuses into the PVD layer. This more non-traditional CVD process is commonly used for the fabrication of perovskite absorber materials and will be discussed further in Section 5.1.
Numerous variations of CVD have been developed to address a wide variety of research and industrial needs. Some of the frequently employed CVD techniques are plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), in which the reactions are carried out under high energy plasma to enhance reaction rates at low temperature, low pressure CVD, atmospheric pressure CVD, and aerosol-assisted CVD (AACVD), in which the precursors are transported in an aerosol to circumvent the need for volatile precursors. This adaptability of CVD has made it attractive for large-area film depositions, as evidenced by its use in the glass coatings and semiconductor industries. In PSCs, CVD is particularly useful for the design of electrodes, encapsulation layers, charge transport layers, and perovskite absorbers, as shown in Fig. 1c. Also, the potential for high-throughput CVD methods makes them desirable for the scaled-up production of PSCs.
ALD is a variant of CVD that utilizes a series of successive, self-terminating, and irreversible gas–solid reactions of at least two compounds in a cyclic manner for the deposition of thin, uniform, and conformal films. The typical ALD process proceeds with the sequence depicted in Fig. 1b. In the first half-reaction, a gaseous precursor is chemisorbed onto the solid surface, and afterwards the byproducts and unreacted precursor molecules are purged out of the reactor. In the next half-reaction, a second precursor is pulsed into the reactor where it reacts with available surface sites. All byproducts and unreacted precursor molecules are then purged out of the reactor. This cycle is repeated until a film of desired thickness is attained.
The primary advantage of ALD over other deposition techniques is its production of conformal thin films that are independent of substrate structure. This high aspect ratio conformality results from a self-limiting property that restricts each of the ALD half-reactions to no more than one layer of growth. As a result of its precise control at the atomic scale, ALD plays an important role in the synthesis of nanostructures, elucidation and modification of material properties, and fabrication of novel materials, all of which have a broad range of applications in many emerging energy technologies. Specifically, ALD has proven useful for the design and synthesis of numerous key features in PSCs including electron transport layers (ETLs), hole transport layers (HTLs), and passivation layers, all of which are critical to the high performance of PSCs. These uses for ALD in the PSC architecture are illustrated in Fig. 1c.
In this review, we systematically discuss the applications of ALD and CVD in the fabrication of charge transport layers, passivation layers, electrodes, absorber layers, buffer and interconnecting layers for tandem solar cells, and encapsulants. We also compare ALD and CVD with PVD techniques used for synthesizing perovskite absorbers. By highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, we present areas of opportunity for new research into better performing PSCs. Lastly, we include a discussion of mitigation of potential compatibility issues between ALD/CVD processes and sensitive PSC absorbers (Section 8). The examples presented in this review were chosen to illustrate the versatility of ALD and CVD for PSC fabrication and are not meant to be exhaustive. An extensive number of literature reports are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. We also refer the reader to other excellent reviews on ALD and CVD applied to PSCs for additional insights.

High-quality charge transport layers in PSCs are essential for the efficient collection of photogenerated electrons and holes from the perovskite at their respective electrodes. A good charge transport material should be selective to only one type of carrier through proper energy level alignment with the conduction and valence bands of the perovskite material. It should also be designed to minimize charge recombination, particularly at the perovskite interface. While many techniques have been explored for the design of these layers, ALD and CVD are gaining traction as a result of the high degree of control that they confer over the resulting material properties. In the subsections that follow, we discuss some important examples in which ALD and CVD have been utilized for the synthesis of charge transport layers and highlight the key advantages that each technique holds.


Metal oxides such as TiO2 and SnO2 have been used extensively as ETLs in PSCs. Borrowing from the dye-sensitized solar cell community, early PSCs adopted a mesostructured configuration. In this design, the perovskite material penetrates inside the framework of a mesoporous ETL, most commonly TiO2, on top of a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode. To prevent photogenerated holes in the perovskite from reaching the TCO where they can recombine with electrons, a compact ETL is typically deposited on the TCO first. To be effective, this compact hole-blocking film must be pinhole free. As a result, the method used for the deposition of a compact TiO2 ETL can drastically influence the overall device performance. Wu et al. demonstrated this effect by fabricating devices with a 50 nm compact TiO2 ETL using three different deposition techniques: ALD, spray pyrolysis, and spin coating. The mesostructured solar cells had power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 12.56%, 8.76%, and 6.52%, respectively for these three techniques, and the resulting current–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a. The authors ascribed the improved performance of the ALD-based devices to reduced interfacial charge recombination and a lower density of nanoscale pinholes in the compact ETL.

Some disadvantages of single-phase TiO2 as an ETL for PSCs are that it suffers from a low charge conductivity and high defect density which can limit overall device performance. Several strategies, including doping of the TiO2, have been explored to address these shortcomings. One novel approach reported by Zhu et al. employed a TiO2 heterojunction structure for the ETL. They utilized a combination of ALD and water bath reactions to obtain the anatase and rutile phases of TiO2, respectively. A heterojunction of the two phases was reported to produce devices with a champion efficiency of 15.3% in comparison to single phase efficiencies of 9.8% and 11.8% for the anatase and rutile phases, respectively. The authors ascribed this significant improvement in PCE to a passivation of trap states, an improvement in carrier extraction, and a reduction in recombination rates that stemmed from improved charge separation of electron–hole pairs at the interface of the heterojunction.
ALD TiO2 has also been used as an ETL for inverted, p–i–n devices. In this architecture, the ALD TiO2 layer not only acts as a selective electron contact but can also help preserve device stability. This device stabilization stems from the dense nature of the TiO2 film afforded by ALD, preventing moisture from the air from reaching the underlying perovskite absorber. Lv et al. demonstrated a low temperature (60 °C) ALD process for producing pinhole-free TiO2 films in planar, inverted devices. The addition of TiO2 resulted in a device efficiency of 18.3%, a marked improvement over 16.4% PCE for devices without TiO2. The ALD TiO2 also extended the lifetime of cells over the course of several hundred hours of storage in air. This result indicated that the TiO2 layer not only reduced interfacial charge recombination, but also improved device stability upon exposure to moisture.
Despite the promising devices that have been produced using TiO2, its inherently low electron mobility and chemical instability under ultraviolet light have motivated the development of more chemically stable and better performing ETLs. SnO2 has shown tremendous potential as an ETL in PSCs, in part due to its deep conduction band, high electron bulk mobility (∼240 cm2 V−1 s−1), wide optical bandgap (3.6–4.0 eV), and excellent chemical stability. The effectiveness of an ALD SnO2 ETL over TiO2 was first demonstrated by Correa-Baena et al. in planar n–i–p devices. Band diagrams constructed from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and diffuse reflectance measurements revealed conduction band misalignment between ALD TiO2 and both MAPbI3 and MA0.15FA0.85Pb(Br0.15I0.85)3 perovskite that is not present with ALD SnO2 (Fig. 2b). The barrier-free alignment for electron extraction from the perovskite to the SnO2 ETL resulted in hysteresis-free J–V characteristics for devices with a 15 nm ALD SnO2 ETL grown at 118 °C, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. Furthermore, better charge transport at the SnO2/perovskite interface led to devices with a PCE as high as 18%. In a similar fashion, Jeong et al. demonstrated that a 12 nm ALD SnO2 ETL with a 180 °C post-deposition anneal also resulted in reproducible devices with a high PCE of 18.3%.
For higher-throughput manufacturing of SnO2 in the design of PSCs, Hoffmann et al. reported the use of spatial ALD for the synthesis of SnO2 at atmospheric pressure without a significant reduction in the electrical properties of the ETL. They documented a champion device efficiency of 12.7% for ETLs deposited at 80 °C with a substrate speed as high as 2.4 m min−1. The devices also exhibited impressive stability for up to 1000 hours of storage in ambient air and over 3000 hours of storage at 60 °C in N2. Further development of these high-throughput ALD systems will pave the way for roll-to-roll manufacturing of inorganic contact layers in stable PSCs.
For an extensive list of ALD ETLs in PSCs, including their processing conditions and resulting device performances, please refer to Table 1.

Compared to traditional ALD, CVD growth of ETLs for PSCs can benefit from faster film growth and shorter processing time. The wide array of chemically active ETL precursors that are available for ALD can likewise be utilized in CVD, yet there are limited reports on the use of CVD to synthesize ETLs. Here, we identify a few instances in which CVD has been used for the design of ETLs, and from the reports, draw insights into the factors that have limited CVD-grown ETLs to date.

In an early demonstration of CVD for ETL design, PECVD was reported for the deposition of ZnO nanocolumns with a preferential vertical orientation. However, a champion device efficiency of only 4.8% was achieved with this nanostructured ETL. The authors used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to probe charge transport in the device and found that the low efficiency primarily stemmed from a high carrier recombination rate in the CVD ZnO. As a further demonstration of the use of CVD for the synthesis of ZnO ETLs, Chen et al. designed an AACVD process where 20 nm ZnO was deposited on fluorine doped tin-oxide (FTO) at a temperature of 350 °C. They reported devices with a PCE of 11.75%, only slightly less than that of ALD-ZnO-based PSCs, which at the time of the report, had PCEs of 13.1%. The authors emphasized the importance of factors such as reaction temperature and precursor concentration on the nucleation and growth of uniform, compact CVD films.
To circumvent the low-vacuum requirements typically needed for both ALD and CVD processing of thin films, Hodgkinson et al. designed a custom, roll-to-roll atmospheric pressure PECVD process to deposit TiO2−x films for applications as ETLs in PSCs. They reported the capability of this method to produce sub-50 nm thick films, and demonstrated its ability to outperform similar films grown by sputtering. Drawing from reports around the impact of pinholes in contact layers on device efficiency, we hypothesize that the relatively poor performance of CVD ETLs stems from poor control over the resulting film morphology. Yet we believe that if properly optimized, CVD holds huge promise for high-throughput deposition of ETLs in PSCs. Hence, attention must be placed on the development of processes that balance deposition speed with film quality. With this dual focus, CVD can become more reliable for producing large-area, high-efficiency devices.

NiO is one of the most commonly used inorganic HTL materials for PSCs. It has been shown to possess high transparency, good electron blocking ability, and good valence band level alignment with that of the perovskite. Numerous techniques have been explored for the synthesis of NiO in PSCs, most notably sol–gel processing. The principal advantage that ALD holds over a sol–gel process is a lower annealing temperature requirement. This key difference makes ALD an attractive, low-energy alternative for NiO deposition. One of the earliest demonstrations of ALD NiO as a high performing HTL in PSCs was carried out by Seo et al. In p–i–n planar devices, they examined the effect of ALD NiO thickness on device performance (Fig. 3a). PCE was low (<10%) at higher NiO thicknesses (>10 nm) because the film exhibits bulk insulating properties. At 5 nm, the film thickness becomes comparable to the material's Debye length, resulting in a higher hole concentration and improved charge transport through the NiO layer. At 2.5 nm, the ALD NiO film is thin enough for electrons to tunnel through, translating to insufficient electron blocking and a reduction in cell efficiencies. To obtain even higher device efficiencies up to 16.4% (open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.04 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.9 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.72), the authors post-annealed the ALD NiO films at 300 °C in order to eliminate water adsorbed to its surface as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). They also connected the removal of water adsorbed to the NiO surface to a reduction in device hysteresis.

To push towards scalable manufacturing of NiO HTLs, Zhao et al. reported a custom-made atmospheric pressure, spatial ALD (AP-SALD) reactor for the deposition of NiO from Ni(CpCH3)2 and O2 at a temperature of 350 °C (Fig. 3b). The reactor set-up allowed for a deposition rate of 72 cm2 nm min−1, and the resultant NiO films were crystalline with a low root-mean-square roughness of 0.6 nm. The authors provided electrical characterization of the NiO as well; the films had a hole concentration of 1.6 × 1018 cm−3, a resistivity of 1.2 × 103 Ohm cm, and a hole mobility of 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. For devices with 10 nm of the AP-SALD NiO as an HTL, the authors reported a reproducible PCE of 17.1% and FF of >0.8 with negligible hysteresis.
A few other ALD materials have been explored as HTLs in planar PSCs. In a study by Chu et al., an ultra-thin ALD VOx film grown at 50 °C was integrated into p–i–n devices. The authors reported that UV-treatment of the film led to a maximum device efficiency of 11.5%. Through XPS measurements they found that the UV-treated film had a higher amount of the V5+ species, corresponding to an increase in the work function of the VOx and an improvement in the extraction of holes. ALD VOx has also been used as a HTL in n–i–p devices. In this application, the VOx doubled as a buffer layer on top of the perovskite for the fabrication of semitransparent PSCs; more details on this system are discussed in Section 6.1. Another promising ALD HTL for PSCs is an alloy formed between TiO2 and IrOx. Tan et al. reported the use of ALD for the synthesis of this alloy at 170 °C in a p–i–n structured device. By tuning the cycle ratio of TiO2 and IrOx in a supercycle method, they could accurately control the Ir content in the film. Optimal device performance of 15.8% PCE was achieved for a 10 nm thick film with 15.5 mol% IrOx. This efficiency was higher than the 14.3% PCE reported using sol–gel NiO of identical thickness as an HTL.

Like CVD-grown ETLs, there are only a few examples of CVD-grown HTLs applied to PSCs. To the best of our knowledge at the time of this publication, there are no reports of CVD-grown metal oxide HTLs (e.g. NiO) applied in PSCs. Interestingly, there are a few reports around the use of CVD-grown transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as HTLs in PSCs. Here, we highlight the key findings from the use of TMDs in PSCs with a focus on the material properties that make them effective for this application.

TMDs are an exciting class of 2-dimensional (2D) materials that are commonly grown using CVD techniques. The electronic properties of these materials can be tuned through compositional and structural engineering, inspiring researchers to explore their use in optoelectronic devices. One particularly appealing application of TMDs for PSCs is as carrier-selective contact layers. Recently, Kim et al. reported the CVD growth of MoS2 and WS2 as HTLs in p–i–n structured devices. The polycrystalline MoS2 and WS2 films were synthesized by thermolysis of (NH4)2MoS4 and (NH4)2WS4 coated silicon substrates, respectively, at 950 °C under an H2/N2 flow carrying sulfur vapor. Afterwards, the TMDs were removed from the silicon substrates via an etching step and transferred onto the device substrate. Work function values of 4.95 eV and 5.0 eV were measured for the CVD MoS2 and WS2, respectively, indicating both 2D materials had good energy level alignment with the valence band of MAPbI3−xClx for efficient hole extraction (Fig. 4a). Devices fabricated with the MoS2 HTL were slightly more efficient (9.5% PCE) than those that incorporated the WS2 HTL (8.0% PCE). Yet, both results were comparable to those of devices with PEDOT:PSS, a common organic HTL, and graphene oxide (GO), another 2D-structured material (Fig. 4b). While this study highlights the potential for CVD-based TMDs in PSCs, there is still significant opportunity for improvement. For example, the further development of low-temperature processes for growing these 2D TMDs would enable their direct fabrication onto device substrates and eliminate the need for an additional transfer step.

Similar to other more established PV technologies, PSC designs often include passivation layers at the perovskite absorber and contact layer interfaces. These passivation layers help to reduce the concentration of surface defects which can lead to unwanted non-radiative carrier recombination at these interfaces. Wide-band gap metal oxides, such as Al2O3 and HfO2, are frequently used for passivation layers; however, the insulating nature of these materials dictates that the films be thin enough to allow for the tunneling of charges. This requirement for thin and conformal layers makes ALD and CVD very attractive techniques in the design of passivation strategies for PSCs.

The use of ALD Al2O3 is one of the most common passivation strategies for PSCs. In one particular example, Koushik et al. demonstrated that ALD half cycles of TMA and H2O can be used to deposit a thin, uniform Al2O3 layer on top of MAPbI3−xClx prior to solution processing of a spiro-OMeTAD HTL (Fig. 5a). Further details regarding some of the challenges associated with ALD processing directly on the perovskite will be discussed in Section 8. Nonetheless, the authors found that 10 cycles of ALD Al2O3 passivation (corresponding to an approximate thickness of 1 nm) improved device PCE from 15% to 18% and reduced the amount of hysteresis observed in the J–V characteristics (Fig. 5b). In addition to providing a boost in efficiency, the Al2O3 layer also stabilized the perovskite films under high humidity conditions (>40% relative humidity (RH)). Devices with the ALD Al2O3 maintained 60–70% of their initial efficiency after 70 days of aging, while devices without the Al2O3 dropped to just 12% of their initial efficiency. ALD Al2O3 passivation between the perovskite and HTL was also reported a couple of years later by Jaysankar et al. for wide-band PSCs. They used alternating cycles of dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI) and H2O at 100 °C to deposit Al2O3 on Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(I0.71Br0.29)3 (Eg = 1.72 eV). Their results indicated that device VOC was strongly dependent on the thickness of the passivation layer. The VOC increased by ∼100 mV up to 1.2 V with 0.8 nm thick Al2O3, then decreased for thicker Al2O3 layers. The authors attributed the increase in VOC at low thicknesses to passivation of dangling bonds at the perovskite surface and the drop in VOC at high thicknesses to the dielectric nature of the Al2O3 creating a barrier for hole extraction. Lee et al. observed a similar improvement in VOC and overall device efficiency by inserting an ALD Al2O3 passivation layer between the compact TiO2 and mesoporous TiO2 ETLs of a n–i–p device; they too hypothesized that the improved performance stems from reduced recombination at the ETL interface.
ALD has been used to grow other metal oxides and nitrides as passivation layers in PSCs, including HfO2, ZrO2, and TiN. Cao et al. introduced an ultra-thin ALD HfO2 layer between the SnO2 ETL and indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode of flexible PSCs. The low temperature (90 °C) ALD HfO2 process was compatible with the flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates and resulted in device efficiencies up to ∼19% PCE for an optimized 5 ALD cycles, as shown in Fig. 5c. An interfacial ALD ZrO2 layer between MAPbBr3 and a PC61BM ETL was found to effectively block hole transport and reduce interfacial recombination. Hu et al. used impedance measurements of their devices to extract the carrier recombination time as a function of photogenerated electron density with and without the ALD ZrO2 passivation layer, shown in Fig. 5d. Over a wide range of illumination levels, the recombination time for electrons was at least an order of magnitude longer with the ALD ZrO2 passivation, leading to higher photovoltage and photocurrent in devices.
A study by Mali et al. further highlighted the advantage of ALD for conformal passivation with precise thickness control for high aspect ratio surfaces. They designed an ultrathin ALD TiO2 layer for the passivation of 1D TiO2 nanorods used as the ETL in mesostructured n–i–p PSC. The vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods were 80–160 nm in diameter and ∼2 μm in length as measured by SEM. They found that 4.8 nm of ALD TiO2 was the optimal thickness for the passivation layer, resulting in an average PCE of 13.5% and an average VOC of 0.945 V. These cells were almost twice as efficient as cells with only 2 nm of ALD TiO2 passivation (average PCE of 7.1% and an average VOC of 0.833). The impact that only a 2–3 nm difference in passivation thickness can have on device performance emphasizes the importance of ALD for those components of a PSC that require atomic-level control.
For an extensive list of ALD passivation layers in PSCs, including their processing conditions and resulting device performances, please refer to Table 1.

ITO is a common TCO material used as an electrode in the PSC field owing to its transparency in the visible spectrum and high conductivity. However, the high cost of indium in ITO has motivated the search for a cheaper alternative. Additionally, the brittleness of ITO presents a barrier for its application in flexible devices that are subjected to repeated bending. Carbon-based electrodes are a potential substitute that address both of these issues. CVD has recently been employed for the growth of 1D-single walled carbon nanotubes and 2D-graphene sheets for application as carbon-based electrodes in both rigid and flexible PSCs. Here, we discuss the use of these CVD-grown carbon allotropes in the replacement of conventional transparent electrodes for PSCs.

The two-dimensional sheets of sp2-coordinated carbon atoms in graphene possess high optical transparency, good conductivity, and excellent mechanical strength, making graphene an attractive replacement for ITO in PSCs. Sung et al. reported the first PSCs with graphene as the transparent conducting anode by utilizing CVD for the synthesis of the graphene layer. They adopted a fabrication method reported by Lee et al. in which methane and hydrogen were supplied at 460 mTorr for 30 minutes with the rates of 24 and 8 sccm, respectively, on top of copper foil heated to 1000 °C in a quartz tube. The monolayer graphene films were obtained after rapid cooling of the quartz tube to room temperature under H2 flow. The graphene films were integrated into inverted, p–i–n devices on top of glass substrates, as shown in Fig. 6a. They introduced an additional MoO3 layer atop the graphene electrode to improve its wettability for solution processing of subsequent layers in the device and to dope the graphene, reducing its sheet resistance from about 2000 Ohm cm−2 to 500 Ohm cm−2 (Fig. 6b). This reduction in sheet resistance led to a significant boost in the device performance from essentially 0% PCE to 17.1% (Fig. 6c), on par with ITO-based device efficiencies of 18.8%. In addition, the champion devices in the graphene and ITO-based configurations had approximately the same VOC (∼1 V) and JSC (∼22 mA cm−2). Higher series resistance in the doped graphene compared to the ITO electrode was compensated by the fact that the graphene was more transparent resulting in similar photocurrents between the two devices. CVD-grown graphene can also be applied as the top electrode in PSCs using a dry transfer process for the fabrication of semi-transparent devices.
These ideas can be extended towards the design of flexible PSCs as well. As shown in Fig. 6d, Yoon et al. adopted an inverted device configuration in which single layer graphene was transferred onto a thin poly-ethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate. Their champion device in this configuration recorded a PCE of 16.8% in comparison to their ITO-based analog which recorded a champion PCE of 17.3%. Nevertheless, they showed that upon introduction of harsh bending conditions (1000 cycles of bending), the graphene-based device retained about 90% of its initial PCE whereas the ITO-based device retained less than 40% of its initial PCE (Fig. 6e). The authors attributed this improvement to the superior robustness of graphene against mechanical deformation, indicating that it holds high potential in the design of flexible PSCs. Similar studies have corroborated the effectiveness of graphene as a flexible charge conductor and an efficient substitute for ITO in PSCs.
Carbon nanotubes, like graphene, also possess good mechanical strength, but their high surface roughness and elevated sheet resistance make it difficult for them to obtain competitive PCEs. In one attempt to demonstrate the applicability of CVD-grown carbon nanotubes in PSCs, Jeon et al. reported the complete replacement of both device electrodes with carbon nanotubes. The scheme for growing the carbon networks involved a floating-catalyst aerosol CVD in which ferrocene vapor was co-introduced with CO into a reactor tube. The ferrocene vapor was decomposed at 880 °C into iron nanoparticles that served as catalysts in the subsequent decomposition of CO into carbon nanotubes. With the use of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as a p-type dopant and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an n-type dopant, they reached a maximum device PCE of 7.3%. The authors presented a cost-performance trade-off, arguing that despite the relatively low performance of their device, their carbon-based electrodes can reduce materials costs in PSC modules by 66% at scale. In light of these findings, we offer that for CVD-grown carbon nanotubes to be implemented in PSCs at scale, rigorous material optimization must be the guiding principle for subsequent device design.
One overarching theme from most CVD electrode studies to date is the need for materials or dopants that augment the conductivity of the carbon-based electrodes, indicating that for CVD-grown electrodes to be freestanding, their deposition schemes may need to be modified. Perhaps the development of CVD chemistries that involve the doping of graphene during its formation could alleviate the need for potentially cost-intensive additional processes.

The absorber layer in PSCs is typically deposited by solution processing techniques, such as spin-coating, due to their ease of fabrication. However, a relative lack of control over solution processing can result in films with large variations in morphology, structure, and porosity. Additionally, there are environmental and health concerns associated with extensive use of organic solvents in solution-based fabrication. A vapor deposition technique like thermal evaporation can generate uniform films on rough or non-uniform surfaces; however, the high financial and energy costs associated with high vacuum equipment makes it difficult to scale-up this technique to large-area devices. CVD has the potential to address these problems by enabling conformal deposition that is reproducible over large-area substrates in low-vacuum or atmospheric pressure conditions. In practice, CVD can be utilized for the fabrication of perovskite absorbers through either a two-step or one-step process.


The two-step method first involves the deposition of a metal or metal halide film (e.g. PbI2) onto a substrate followed by exposure to an ammonium halide vapor (i.e. MAI), converting the film to the desired perovskite phase. A proof-of-concept system for the two-step method was first developed by Leyden et al. for the fabrication of planar MAPbCl3 devices. A schematic of their multi-zone CVD reactor is shown in Fig. 7a. In the high temperature zone, methylammonium iodide (MAI) was vaporized then transported by a N2 gas flow to a low temperature zone where it was passed over previously deposited PbCl2 films on FTO/TiO2 substrates. This technique was coined a hybrid CVD (HCVD) process because the MAI precursor started as a solid salt in the reactor. Parameters such as reactor pressure, N2 flow rate, MAI temperature, and substrate temperature were precisely controlled to ensure high-quality and reproducible perovskite films. Device performance was optimized for an initial PbCl2 layer thickness of around 100 nm, corresponding to a final perovskite thickness of around 300 nm. In addition, a 120 °C post-anneal of the perovskite films in air was found to improve device performance over a post-anneal in an N2 environment. The maximum PCE achieved in this study was 11.8%, and similar J–V characteristics for an entire batch of devices showed the relative consistency of the HCVD deposition process. The cells also demonstrated good performance stability after 450+ hours of storage in N2.

More recently, a high-efficiency MAPbI3-based PSC was produced using a similar two-step HCVD design. In this study, Surya et al. first spin-coated PbI2 onto an FTO/TiO2 substrate followed by HCVD conversion into MAPbI3 by way of MAI vapor. The authors tuned several parameters, including carrier gas composition, deposition temperature, and post-deposition cooling, to achieve a high-quality perovskite film resulting in a champion PCE of 17.6%. The optimal deposition temperature was found to be 165 °C. They reported an optimal carrier gas concentration of 85% N2 and 15% O2, proposing that the small amount of oxygen passivated the traps states at the MAPbI3 surface. Also, their report stated a reduction in shunting pathways when the post-deposition cooling rate was lowered to 0.7 °C min−1, indicating desirable crystallization rates for MAPbI3 and a reduction in the concentration of pinholes. As a final parameter, they discovered relative improvements over planar devices when a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold was used. This improvement was attributed to better crystallinity of the mesoporous TiO2-based MAPbI3 films as shown by the XRD spectra in Fig. 7b. Forward and reverse J–V scans of the champion two-step HCVD MAPbI3 device are shown in Fig. 7c, exhibiting negligible hysteretic behavior.
Luo et al. proposed a slightly different reactor design for two-step CVD synthesis of MAPbI3 absorbers. In their in situ tubular CVD (ITCVD) reactor, PbI2 films were place directly above the MAI powder source in a single temperature zone heated to 145 °C and allowed to react for 120 minutes. The films formed during the deposition were washed in isopropanol and annealed in air at 145 °C for 30 minutes before finishing the device structure. MAPbI3 films were deposited on substrate sizes up to 4 cm × 4 cm, demonstrating the potential scalability of the technique. Subsequently, the authors attributed the good optical properties of the absorber to its high crystallinity and verified its crystal structure using XRD. With a champion device efficiency of 12.2%, they indicated that their technique holds high potential for future mass production of perovskites. Other reports of two-step HCVD processes for the fabrication of MAPbI3 devices have also been published. In addition, more complex perovskite stoichiometries have been reported using this method; for example, Sn/Pb alloys with various atomic ratios of the two metals can be converted to low band gap (Eg < 1.4 eV) perovskite films. While two-step CVD shows promise for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite absorbers, a desire to minimize the number of processing steps associated with perovskite deposition has also led researchers to explore one-step CVD schemes.

In one-step CVD, the perovskite is synthesized by a single reaction of the precursor vapors in the gas phase before subsequent deposition onto the substrate. This method provides a direct route to the synthesis of perovskites with a focus on fewer control parameters, unlike the two-step CVD method. Tavakoli et al. designed a one-step CVD furnace for the synthesis of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx absorbers by co-vaporizing MAI and PbX2 (X = I or Cl) salts under an argon gas flow at 360 °C (Fig. 8a), resulting in device PCEs as high as 11.1%. Scanning electron microscopy images of the CVD MAPbI3−xClx films showed large perovskite morphological grain sizes with good surface coverage, and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements indicated long carrier lifetimes (∼120 ns) and diffusion lengths (700–800 nm), which are important for maximizing the collection of photogenerated electrons and holes from the perovskite layer.

Another strategy for one-step CVD of perovskite absorbers is to use an AACVD approach. In an AACVD design, the perovskite precursor salts are first dissolved in solvent. An ultrasonic nebulizer is then used to aerosolize the precursor solution before it is carried by an inert gas flow into the reactor to react with the heated substrates. The ability to carry out this one-step reaction process at atmospheric pressure is attractive for scaled-up fabrication. AACVD of MAPbBr3 was first demonstrated by Lewis et al. in 2014 (Fig. 8b). Shortly after, Bhachu et al. reported the use of AACVD to grow phase pure and compositionally uniform MAPbI3 films at 200 °C. Later studies on one-step AACVD further examined the effects of various processing parameters on the nucleation and growth of the perovskite absorbers. Afzaal et al. found that the position of the substrates in a hot wall reactor was critical for obtaining uniform, high-quality MAPbI3 films. If the substrates were placed too far from the precursor vapor inlet, the conversion of PbI2 to perovskite was limited by mass diffusion of MAI to the substrate surface. Additionally, the authors optimized the structure and morphology of AACVD MAPbI3 with respect to the reaction temperature. At the optimal temperature of 250 °C, the resulting perovskite layer was a highly crystalline and compact film. Lastly, Basak et al. investigated the effects of varying the halide composition of the MAPbI3−yBry precursor solution on the resultant film properties. For a deposition temperature of 140 °C, they found that the perovskite morphological grain size increased with increasing bromine content (Fig. 8c), yet energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy revealed that in all cases, the films were still iodine rich relative to the stoichiometry of the starting precursor solution.

To date, ALD has not been used in practice for the deposition of the perovskite absorber layer in PSCs. The slower deposition rates associated with the sequential nature of ALD reactions would necessitate prohibitively long deposition times for perovskite films with thicknesses on the order of hundreds of nanometers. Nevertheless, two recent studies reported the use of ALD to grow a precursor seed layer that can then be converted to MAPbI3 in a post-treatment step. Sutherland et al. started with ALD of PbS from alternating pulses of lead(II) bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) (Pb(tmhd)2) and H2S at 150 °C. They then vapor treated the PbS films in iodine gas to form PbI2 followed by conversion to MAPbI3 in a MAI solution. Popov et al. reduced the number of conversions by using ALD to grow the PbI2 directly. The PbI2 was deposited using alternative half-cycles of lead(II) bis(bis-(trimethylsilyl)amide) (Pb(btsa)2) and tin(IV) iodide (SnI4) in a temperature window of 70–90 °C. A single vapor treatment step with MAI converted the ALD PbI2 to MAPbI3. While there have been no reports of devices incorporating ALD-based perovskite absorbers, these two studies serve as proofs-of-concept for future development of a metal halide perovskite ALD processes.


Besides CVD, various other vapor deposition techniques such as PVD have been successfully applied towards the fabrication of absorbers in PSCs. One commonly used PVD method is multi-source thermal evaporation, in which the perovskite precursors are independently and simultaneously heated to their sublimation temperatures and co-deposited on a substrate suspended overhead. Similar to the one-step CVD method, it can be challenging to control perovskite film stoichiometry or access more complex perovskite compositions using this technique. This difficulty arises from differences in sublimation temperatures and partial pressures of metal halide and organic cation precursors, making it difficult to control individual precursor deposition rates. In addition, the requirement for each precursor powder to have its own source increases the design complexity of tools needed for the deposition of multi-component films. These limitations are particularly relevant given that many recent advances in device stability and multi-junction PSCs rely on carefully tuning the ratios of several different cations (e.g. methylammonium, formamidinium, cesium, etc.), metals (e.g. tin and lead), and halides (e.g. iodide, bromide, and chloride). Two-step CVD, sequential vapor deposition of precursors, or post-treatments can offer more flexibility in terms of achieving multi-component perovskite films, but often require multiple fabrication steps or tools, making them less financially attractive for scaled-up device fabrication. Single-source and flash evaporation techniques, in which a pre-formed perovskite film or powder is rapidly evaporated from a single-source heater, has also been implemented with some success.

There are some key differences between ALD/CVD schemes and the PVD techniques mentioned thus far that are important to consider with regard to large-scale perovskite absorber fabrication. PVD systems, which typically operate at pressures between 10−5 to 10−7 Torr, have higher vacuum requirements than their CVD counterparts. Not only do these high vacuum conditions add costs associated with pumping equipment, but they also limit PVD to batch processing. On the other hand, CVD reactors, which operate from low vacuum (10−3 Torr) to atmospheric pressure, are much more amenable to roll-to-roll processing, leading to higher throughput manufacture of perovskite films. Another important factor to consider is the amount of precursor material used per device area. In large PVD chambers, there is typically a large distance between the source and substrate, leading to a significant amount of wasted precursor material being deposited on the chamber walls. To counteract this issue, close-proximity ALD and CVD reactors have been engineered to shorten the distance between precursor inlets and the substrate. By using inert gas curtains to separate precursor zones, these types of reactors enable precursor recycling which can greatly reduce materials waste. To date, close-proximity reactors have mostly been used for metal oxide growth, yet the design could be extended to the growth of perovskite absorbers as well. While vacuum-based PVD systems have been successfully adopted in other mature semiconductor and coatings industries, continuous CVD processing in an atmospheric pressure reactor is an exciting alternative prospect for the fabrication of metal halide perovskite films.

Improvements in the PCE of a given solar cell technology directly correlate to reductions in the overall PV system cost. Tandem solar cells are a proven strategy for achieving higher PCEs beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit for single-junction cells. Due to their tunable band gap and low-cost deposition methods, metal halide perovskites are uniquely suited for tandem solar cell applications. Lead-based perovskites have been utilized as the wide band gap subcell of tandem devices in conjunction with a low band gap absorber, such as crystalline silicon or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). Wide band gap and low band gap (achieved by alloying Sn with Pb at the metal site) perovskites can also be used together in all-perovskite tandem devices. In the past several years, ALD metal oxide layers have significantly contributed to the development and success of perovskite tandems, which are now approaching PCEs of 30% at the laboratory scale. In this section, we will discuss the various uses and benefits afforded by ALD for perovskite tandems.


Tandem devices require that the wide band gap subcell be semitransparent, allowing near-infrared (NIR) light to pass through and be absorbed in the low band gap subcell. This condition dictates that both electrodes of the wide band gap cell in a 4-terminal configuration, or the front electrode and interconnecting layer in a 2-terminal configuration, be highly transmissive. TCOs are frequently used for these applications and are often sputtered on top of the perovskite subcell. To avoid damage to the perovskite material during sputtering, an additional buffer layer is employed.

The most common example of an ALD buffer overlayer is the use of SnO2 in the p–i–n architecture. ALD SnO2 was first demonstrated in this capacity by Eperon et al. for all-perovskite tandems and by Bush et al. for 2-terminal perovskite–silicon tandems (Fig. 9a). Since then, many of the highest-reported efficiency (some >25%) perovskite tandem solar cells utilize an ALD SnO2 buffer overlayer. These SnO2 layers are typically grown at low temperatures (<120 °C) using TDMASn and water as the metal–organic precursor and co-reactant, respectively. While the SnO2 itself is an electron-selective transport material, an additional fullerene layer is deposited prior to ALD processing. Issues associated with ALD processing directly on the perovskite material will be covered in Section 8. In addition to its role as a sputter buffer layer, the ALD SnO2 also improves the long-term stability of the perovskite cell (Fig. 9a). Water and oxygen ingress from the air, metal diffusion from the electrodes, and the evolution of volatile decomposition products at elevated temperature are all degradation pathways that limit the stability of PSCs. The dense and conformal nature of an ALD metal oxide layer helps minimize the extent to which these processes occur.
Our group recently demonstrated that ALD vanadium oxide (VOx) can also be used as a sputter buffer overlayer in the n–i–p architecture. Previously, thermally evaporated molybdenum oxide (MoOx) has been commonly used in this capacity; however, MoOx has been shown to interact negatively with the perovskite material leading to device failure. Preliminary long-term stability tests with the VOx were promising, with devices maintaining their performance after 1000 hours at 85 °C in N2.

A low band gap subcell with a rough or textured surface presents additional constraints for the subsequent processing of a perovskite subcell in a 2-terminal tandem configuration. Mainly, each layer in the perovskite subcell must conformally coat surface features ranging from the nanoscale to microscale without pinholes or large defects that could short the device. Solution deposition techniques such as spin coating or blade coating can be ineffective in these applications, particularly for contact layers which tend to be only tens of nanometers thick. Instead, one can take advantage of the self-limiting, gas phase reactions of ALD to achieve conform deposition of ultra-thin contact layers in non-planar devices. One excellent example of this application of ALD was recently published by Jošt et al. for a perovskite–CIGS tandem cell. Multi-stage evaporation of the CIGS absorber layer resulted in a rough surface morphology of the bottom cell with feature sizes ranging from 50 nm to 1 μm. To avoid shunting of the perovskite subcell, the authors utilized a 10 nm layer of ALD NiOx grown at 150 °C as the hole contact layer. Conformal growth of the ALD NiO was confirmed by EDX mapping of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 9b). They also employed a SnO2 buffer layer on top of the perovskite to enable the deposition of an indium zinc oxide (IZO) transparent electrode, as discussed in Section 6.1.

Another example of ALD for contact layers in non-planar tandem devices was reported by Sahli et al. in the first demonstration of a fully textured perovskite–silicon tandem solar cell. Up until then, 2-terminal perovskite–silicon tandem devices featured silicon subcells with polished front surfaces to allow for solution deposition of the perovskite cell on top. Most commercial silicon cells are made with texturing on both sides to minimize surface reflection through light trapping. Polishing one side of the cell introduces an additional costly step to the fabrication process and results in undesirable reflections that limit photocurrent. Sahli et al. designed a fully vapor-processed perovskite cell to preserve the texturing of the underlying silicon cell and relied upon the conformality of an ALD SnO2 buffer layer (described in Section 6.1) to complete the front electrode, resulting in an impressive tandem cell efficiency of 25.2%.

Another important component of 2-terminal tandem devices is the interlayer that connects the two subcells in series. Ideally, this interlayer should efficiently shuttle photogenerated carriers between the two subcells with minimal electrical and optical losses. One common approach is to use a TCO, such as ITO, IZO, or aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), as a recombination contact. In an early demonstration of this strategy, Albrecht et al. utilized ALD SnO2 (15 nm) together with sputtered ITO (80 nm) to form a recombination contact in monolithic, n–i–p perovskite–Si tandem solar cells, resulting in a stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 18.1%. The use of a thick TCO as a recombination layer, however, can result in significant parasitic absorption of visible and near-infrared light that limits the achievable photocurrent in the low band gap subcell. Additionally, high lateral conductivity of the sputtered TCO can exacerbate shunt pathways in either subcell. To address both of these issues, Palmstrom et al. developed a thin, 25 nm recombination layer of ALD AZO for all-perovskite, 2-terminal tandem solar cells. The conformal ALD TCO recombination layer sufficiently protected the bottom cell during subsequent fabrication of the top cell. The ALD AZO also had a high sheet resistance, preventing lateral conduction of carriers to shunt pathways, but was thin enough to not impede out-of-plane carrier transport between subcells. This tailored ALD recombination layer enabled the fabrication of both rigid and flexible 2-terminal, all-perovskite tandem solar cells with PCEs of 23.1% and 21.3%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9c.

Instead of a single recombination layer, some monolithic, multi-junction solar cells use tunnel junctions as interconnects. In a typical p–n tunnel junction, a narrow depletion region forms at the interface between heavily doped p-type (p+) and n-type (n+) materials, allowing carriers to tunnel between subcells with low electrical resistance and a minimal loss in voltage. For example, some perovskite–Si tandem devices intentionally add tunnel junctions consisting of adjacent p+ and n+ doped, hydrogenated amorphous or nanocrystalline silicon deposited by PECVD. However, adding layers to the device stack to create a tunnel junction can also introduce unwanted parasitic absorption and limit tandem efficiency. To avoid this problem, Shen et al. engineered the interface between the p+ emitter of a silicon homojunction bottom cell and the ALD TiO2 ETL of a perovskite top cell to directly contact the two subcells without adding an n+ doped interlayer. The in situ tunnel junction between the ALD TiO2 and p+ silicon produced a highly ohmic contact with low resistive losses and minimal optical absorption. Consequently, the resulting tandem solar cell had an SPO efficiency of 24.1%, a marked improvement over previous 2-terminal perovskite–Si tandems in the n–i–p architecture.

In order for PSCs to become a viable, commercial PV technology, they will ultimately need to demonstrate stable operation in the field over the course several years to decades. While developing strategies to minimize internal degradation pathways within the solar cell is imperative to achieving this goal, external encapsulation of the cells to isolate them from stressors in the environment, such as oxygen or moisture, is equally as important. For rigid modules, the perovskite solar cell community can largely mimic the glass encapsulation designs used by the well-established silicon PV industry. Many emerging applications of solar PV, however, could benefit from light-weight, flexible perovskite modules. For flexible perovskite devices, the encapsulants themselves must also be flexible. In addition, they should be impermeable to moisture and resilient against fracture or delamination upon repeated bending or flexing.

Thin film encapsulation (TFE) is one promising candidate for enabling the long-term environmental stability of flexible perovskite devices. TFE typically consists of a dense inorganic layer with a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), a nanolaminate of alternating organic and inorganic layers, or a hybrid organic–inorganic material. The addition of organic interlayers provides additional flexibility and can even further reduce the WVTR. ALD and CVD are both attractive techniques for the deposition of TFE materials and are used commercially for the encapsulation of organic electronics and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). While CVD is currently more prevalent in industry due to its high-throughput processing, ALD has garnered significant attention for TFE because of the high-quality films that it affords.
To date, there have been a limited number of reports of ALD or CVD for TFE of PSCs. A short summary of the results from each study is listed in Table 2. The simplest designs focus on the use of a single layer of ALD Al2O3 to protect devices from moisture in the air. Choi et al. demonstrated that 50 nm of ALD Al2O3 deposited using TMA and water at 95 °C can stabilize mesoporous FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 devices in humid conditions. They reported only a 4% drop in PCE following 7500 hours (∼10 months) of storage at room temperature in the dark with 50% RH. Ramos et al. highlighted the importance of using a low-temperature TFE deposition process for perovskite applications. By reducing the ALD Al2O3 deposition temperature from 90 °C to 60 °C, they were able to retain a higher initial PCE following encapsulation, as shown in Fig. 10a. The low-temperature encapsulation process also improved device longevity. MAPbI3 solar cells coated with 16 nm of ALD Al2O3 retained >75% of their initial efficiency upon aging in ambient air for 2256 hours.

Integrating organic layers with inorganic materials is one strategy to improve the efficacy and/or flexibility of TFEs. In one of the first demonstrations of TFE for PSCs, Chang et al. encapsulated semitransparent MAPbI3 devices with a PET substrate coated in 50 nm of ALD Al2O3 (Fig. 10b). Not only did the bilayer encapsulant result in devices with minimal PCE loss after 45 days of storage in ambient air, but it also maintained low ambient WVTRs of 2.1 × 10−3 g m−2 day−1 and 7.9 × 10−3 g m−2 day−1 following 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 13 mm and 5 mm, respectively. Choi et al. reported a similar design using a bilayer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (55 μm) and ALD Al2O3 (30 nm) on top of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 devices. The authors showed that ALD Al2O3 permeates into the PDMS film, filling voids in the polymer layer and reducing its water permeability (WVTR of 5.1 × 10−3 g m−2 day−1 at 45 °C–65% RH) and hydrophilicity. Their bilayer TFE design outperformed Al2O3-only encapsulated devices after 300 hours of aging at 45 °C–65% RH, with the PDMS/Al2O3 devices experiencing less than an 8% relative drop in PCE. An organic–inorganic multilayer TFE structure is an even more effective approach for perovskite solar cell stability. Lee et al. combined a low-temperature (60 °C) thermal ALD Al2O3 process and poly(1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-trivinyl cyclotrisiloxane) (pV3D3) grown at 40 °C using initiated CVD (iCVD) to demonstrate impressive device stability under harsh testing conditions. The WVTR for a nanolaminate consisting of 4 repeating units of pV3D3/Al2O3 was 5.3 × 10−4 g m−2 day−1 in a 38 °C–90% RH environment. The low water permeability of this multilayer TFE resulted in a retention of 97% of initial PCE for high-efficiency (18.2%) FA0.87MA0.13Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3 devices after exposure to 50 °C–50% RH for 300 hours (Fig. 10c). The improved stability associated with the nanolaminate TFE was likely due to a longer and more tortuous path for the diffusion of water molecules into the devices or for the effusion of volatile perovskite degradation products.
The use of molecular layer deposition (MLD) to grow hybrid organic–inorganic encapsulant materials is another promising approach to extend the lifetime of PSCs. Wang et al. used alternating cycles of TMA and ethylene glycol to grow alucone at 50 °C directly on perovskite devices. By itself, the hybrid alucone layer acted as a decent water barrier with a WVTR of 6.6 × 10−3 g m−2 day−1 in a 30 °C–80% RH environment. Its performance as an encapsulant was improved with the addition of PEALD Al2O3 in a bilayer structure. Typically, the O2 plasma from PEALD would be incompatible with the underlying perovskite material (see Section 7). Yet, in situ quadrupole mass spectroscopy (QMS) revealed that excess carbon in the alucone film protected the perovskite during PEALD by consuming O2 plasma and forming CO2 as a byproduct. The resulting WVTR of a double bilayer of alucone and PEALD Al2O3 was an impressive 1.6 × 10−5 g m−2 day−1 at 30 °C–80% RH. This encapsulation design allowed PSCs to maintain 95% of their initial efficiency after 300 min submerged in water and 96% of their initial efficiency after >2100 hours at 30 °C and 80% RH.
There is still ample room for improvement of ALD- and CVD-based TFEs for perovskite solar cell applications. The exploration of new hybrid organic–inorganic materials (e.g. metalcones) and the development of single-reactor systems that can easily accommodate switching between the deposition of both organic and inorganic films are two avenue that could lead to a scalable encapsulation solution. In addition, a better understanding of how TFEs respond to applied mechanical stresses, as well as a set of standardized tests for comparing different TFE designs, are necessary to aid in this development. Nevertheless, a TFE solution via ALD/CVD could be the key to unlocking an array of new, dynamic applications for flexible PSCs.

For many of the applications discussed in the previous sections (e.g. passivation, contact, and buffer layers), ALD or CVD processing occurs after deposition of the perovskite material during device fabrication. In these cases, the perovskite is subjected to the environment inside the reactor during film growth. Elements such as temperature and co-reactant or precursor exposure all have the potential to alter the structure and composition, and consequently the optoelectronic properties, of the perovskite material. These effects are amplified in circumstances where ALD/CVD is grown directly on the perovskite without any interlayers. The extent to which these interactions occur is also largely dependent up the ALD/CVD reaction chemistry and the initial composition of the perovskite film. An increase in the number of reports of ALD, in particular, on top of the perovskite in the past few years has prompted more fundamental and mechanistic studies of the interactions between metal halides perovskites and ALD precursors and co-reactants. In this section we will provide commentary only on these ALD reports, noting that similar effects are likely to occur for analogous CVD processes.

The most well studied system to date is ALD Al2O3 grown directly on the commonly used MAPbI3 absorber. In practice, ultra-thin ALD Al2O3 layers are used in this capacity as passivation/barrier layers to improve the environmental stability of the perovskite in the presence of heat and moisture (Section 3.1). They have also replaced traditional contact layers on top of the perovskite to create metal–insulator–semiconductor (M–I–S) rear contacts. In all of these examples, the ALD Al2O3 is deposited at a low temperature (<100 °C) to minimize thermally induced stress on the perovskite material. Various co-reactants have been explored with inconsistent results. Kim et al. showed that a TMA and ozone-based ALD process resulted in a complete loss of the crystalline MAPbI3−xClx phase and bleaching of the perovskite film. They observed a similar, albeit less pronounced effect with H2O as the co-reactant. These results compelled them to use a non-hydrolytic aluminum triisopropoxide (AIP) and acetic acid (AA) ALD process to stabilize the perovskite with an Al2O3 overlayer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of MAPbI3−xClx films exposed to 200 cycles of AIP and AA at 100 °C confirmed no bulk formation of a crystalline PbI2 degradation product. Zardetto et al. showed that O2 plasma, even at a low deposition temperature of 30 °C, is also too harsh of a co-reactant, causing partial bulk degradation of MAPbI3 to PbI2. However, unlike Kim et al., they did not observe any change to the crystallinity or surface composition of the perovskite upon exposure to repeated TMA/H2O cycles at 80 °C. In particular, the XPS peaks corresponding to iodine and nitrogen from the methylammonium cation were unchanged following Al2O3 deposition.
Several other reports that probed the perovskite surface during and/or after ALD Al2O3 deposition by TMA and H2O contradict the findings of Zardetto et al. One study in particular by Koushik et al. used the same XPS characterization to show that nitrogen is abstracted from the surface of the perovskite film during ALD Al2O3 deposition at 80 °C. This loss of nitrogen implies an etching of the methylammonium cation from the perovskite lattice. The authors also used in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy during ALD film growth (Fig. 11a) and observed a reduction in the bands associated with the stretching and bending modes of N–H with an increasing number of ALD cycles, corroborating the XPS results. Koushik et al. went on to propose a mechanism for the initial reaction between TMA and the MAPbI3 surface shown in Fig. 11b. They hypothesized that in the first half cycle, the TMA molecule interacts with the methylammonium cation, releasing methylamine and methane and forming a PbI3–Al(CH3)2 adduct that further reacts with H2O in the second half cycle to form –OH groups that can propagate Al2O3 growth in subsequent cycles. This mechanism was supported by in-depth density functional theory calculations in an independent study by Choudhury et al. Loss of N from the perovskite was observed for up to 200 ALD Al2O3 cycles, indicating that despite the formation of an Al2O3 overlayer, perovskite degradation products continue to effuse from the surface upon successive TMA pulses (Fig. 11c). It is also important to note that despite the compositional changes observed at the perovskite surface, no bulk decomposition or structural changes to the perovskite were observed by XRD.
A recent paper by Yu et al. further investigated the etching of MAPbI3 during thermal ALD of Al2O3 by exploring the effect of deposition temperature and TMA partial pressure. They found via in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements and QMS that TMA partial pressures as low as 0.1 Torr will etch a MAPbI3 film at 75 °C, resulting in a nucleation delay of roughly ten cycles before Al2O3 begins to accumulate on the perovskite surface. By reducing the temperature to 25 °C and maintaining the 0.1 Torr TMA pulses, they observed steady Al2O3 growth from the onset. However, increasing the partial pressure of the TMA to 3 Torr resulted in etching of the MAPbI3 beyond just the surface region at 25 °C, as was evident by a continual mass loss of perovskite with high TMA exposure. This study highlights that varying ALD process parameters can result in drastically different perovskite/metal oxide interfaces and suggests that discrepancies within the literature could be due to differences in deposition conditions across laboratories.
The compatibility of ALD SnO2 growth on perovskites has also been evaluated recently, due to its extensive use for electron contacts and buffer layers in multijunction solar cells. In one study, Hultqvist et al. used TDMASn and H2O to conformally deposit ALD SnO2 directly onto a mixed cation, mixed halide MAxFA1−xPbBryI1−y perovskite. Their XPS results indicated that a single 30 seconds of exposure to the TDMASn precursor at 120 °C (>11 Torr s of total precursor exposure) does not alter the surface composition or bulk crystallinity of the perovskite. Yet, the performances of inverted solar cells that incorporated ALD SnO2 as an electron contact were significantly lower than those of control devices with a PCBM electron contact. The highest reported efficiency was ∼4.0% with 50 cycles of ALD SnO2, and the cells also displayed a significant amount of hysteresis. XPS depth profiling revealed that the perovskite/SnO2 interface was halide-rich, suggesting that the poor performance could be due to an energy barrier at the interface caused by undesirable perovskite/precursor interactions upon repeated ALD cycling. Palmstrom et al. also conducted a thorough investigation of the effects of ALD SnO2 growth on perovskites and found further evidence of surface damage upon deposition. Following 60 cycles of thermal ALD SnO2, they observed a loss of nitrogen from the surface of a FA0.17Cs0.83PbBr0.17I0.83 film by XPS (Fig. 11d), as well as the formation of PbI2 and contraction of the perovskite lattice parameter by XRD. Their results also indicated that the TDMASn precursor has a stronger effect on perovskite degradation than either H2O or temperature exposure up to 150 °C. In contrast to the findings of Hultqvist et al., they observed the same PbI2 formation and lattice contraction of the perovskite after 60 consecutive pulses of TDMASn (6 Torr s of total precursor exposure). These results imply removal of the formamidinium cation by TDMASn, similar to the etching effects reported for ALD Al2O3. To avoid this issue, an organic ETL (e.g. C60) is typically used as an interfacial layer to protect the perovskite from ALD SnO2 precursor damage. Other strategies, such as using a pulsed-CVD process with shorter purge times, can also reduce exposure of the perovskite to the ALD precursor during contact layer deposition.
Several other ALD metal oxides with applications as electron or hole contacts were tested by Zardetto et al. on perovskite substrates, including O2 plasma-based TiO2, MoOx, and NiO, as well as thermal ZnO. All three of the O2 plasma-based processes altered the surface chemistry of a MAPbI3 film, including a complete loss of nitrogen and iodine oxidation as determined by XPS. This extent of surface modification does not bode well for the successful application of these processes in working PSCs. Interestingly, the thermal ALD ZnO process, consisting of cycles of DEZ and H2O, also presented its own issues. In addition to causing significant degradation of the MAPbI3 substrate, the ZnO did not appear to grow on the perovskite substrate; this finding was also observed by Hultqvist et al. Further research is required to understand what inhibits nucleation of ALD ZnO on the perovskite surface.
The complexity associated with different ALD metal oxide processes and the large number of accessible perovskite compositions make it challenging to predict how the two components will interact and if the resulting interface will translate to an efficient and stable solar cell. This difficulty is evident by the often-conflicting results published in the literature. However, some general guidelines can be formed based on the existing reports. For the systems already studied, it appears that low temperature (<100 °C), thermal processes (i.e. with H2O as the co-reactant) are preferred to achieve more stable interfaces and avoid bulk perovskite degradation. Additionally, it appears that metal–organic ALD precursors can react with organic cations in the perovskite film altering its surface composition and structure even at lower temperatures. The development of more sensitive, in situ characterization techniques, such as ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence, are needed to uncover how these changes affect optoelectronic properties at the perovskite/ALD interface. While organic interlayers can limit damage associated with ALD processing, there is a strong desire to find alternatives because of the high costs and low stability associated with them. Strategies aimed at stabilizing the perovskite surface prior to ALD could help achieve this goal and enable the deposition of inorganic contacts directly on top of the perovskite active layer.

The versatility of ALD and CVD makes them useful tools for the fabrication of many components of PSCs. In this review, we highlighted the effectiveness of these vapor deposition techniques for improving both device efficiency and stability. In addition to their use for the synthesis of perovskite absorbers, contact layers, and electrodes, ALD and CVD can provide effective passivation of interfaces to reduce defects and improve charge collection. ALD buffer layers and interconnects have enabled the fabrication of impressive, high-efficiency multi-junction solar cells while also contributing to improved stability. Additionally, device lifetimes can be further extended by employing low-temperature, hybrid ALD/CVD encapsulation schemes.

Based on the literature to date, there are several trends in the application of ALD and CVD to PSCs that can inform future research and development in the field. First, significant effort thus far has focused on improving the performance of ALD-grown ETLs, particularly TiO2 and SnO2. Some strategies that have been implemented include tuning ALD parameters to achieve a desired phase or film thickness and in situ doping of the ETL to improve its conductivity. Less attention has been given to developing new or improving existing ALD/CVD HTL materials. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that most early research focused on PSCs in the n–i–p architecture. In this structure, the ETL is deposited first as a substrate and as a result, ALD/CVD processing conditions are not limited by the instability of the perovskite absorber (see Section 8). Recently, however, researchers have shown that similar high efficiencies can be achieved with p–i–n PSCs. For this reason, we expect significantly more exploration of ALD/CVD HTLs in the coming years. This research could include the development of novel precursor chemistries or the investigation of ternary or quaternary materials.
Next, we recognize the important role that contact layers play in stabilizing PSCs for long-term operation. For a perovskite module to last for an extended period of time in the field, it must be resilient to both internal and external stressors. While an effective encapsulation scheme can eliminate exposure to air, moisture and UV light, it does not prevent against reactions that can occur between various layers of the device. Organic contact layers, including polymers and small molecules, are widely used in PSCs; however, they are typically insufficient for arresting the diffusion of reactive species (e.g., metal from the electrodes) throughout the device and can be intrinsically unstable, for example when exposed to heat. Inorganic ALD and CVD contact layers can be used in conjunction with or completely replace organic contacts to act as ‘built-in’ barrier layers. ALD contacts, in particular, are uniquely suited and the ideal choice for this application because of their conformality and density at low film thicknesses. In PSC modules, they can also help protect areas of the perovskite absorber that become exposed when using scribe lines to create interconnects between subcells.
Continued development of high-throughput reactors will ensure that advances made in the laboratory translate to PSCs at the industrial scale. While some high-throughput ALD/CVD reactors are currently available commercially, the set of materials they can grow is still quite limited. Breakthroughs in design to accommodate plasma-enhanced growth or organic precursors are needed to enhance the capability of these tools. Integrating in situ characterization techniques into reactors can also greatly expedite new process development. As interest in ALD and CVD for PSC applications has grown, there has been an increase in the number of studies aimed at understanding how ALD/CVD conditions affect the interfacial and bulk chemical properties of metal halide perovskite materials (see Section 8). Again, these preliminary studies have been limited to only a few precursor chemistries and perovskite compositions. Broader studies that incorporate more ALD/CVD processes and also characterize changes to the electronic structure of the perovskite are needed.
Lastly, ALD/CVD have expanded the utility of PSCs considerably in the past few years. Tandem solar cells that incorporate perovskite sub-cells continue to climb in efficiency and are a promising entry to market for the technology in a competitive solar PV industry. ALD/CVD buffer layers and interconnects have been instrumental in the success of these tandem devices thus far (see Section 6), again relying upon the conformality and density of the resultant films. Going forward, we foresee that ALD and CVD will also contribute to the application of PSCs in emerging solar markets (Fig. 12). For example, the growing transportation industry, internet-of-things, wearable electronics, and portable water purification systems could all benefit from lightweight, flexible modules that have the same reliability as traditional, rigid modules with glass encapsulation. Hybrid TFEs that combine both ALD and CVD layers are gaining traction in the organic electronics industry and should be considered for these flexible PSCs as well.
