The synthesis and characterization of new hybrid materials based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) covalently functionalized by 4,4′-difluoro-8-(4-propynyloxy)-phenyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) (2) or 7-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)-3-(3′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)-coumarin (4) as light harvesting groups have been described. The organic solar cell performances of these novel nanomaterials in P3HT:PCBM blends were investigated. These covalently bonded hybrid materials (reduced graphene oxide:BODIPY (GB), reduced graphene oxide:Coumarin (GC), SWCNTs:BODIPY (CB) and SWCNTs:Coumarin (CC)) were prepared by an azide–alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (click) reaction between the azide bearing SWCNTs or rGO and terminal ethynyl functionalized BODIPY (2) or coumarin (4) derivatives. The formation of novel nanomaterials was confirmed by FT-IR, UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopies and thermogravimetric analysis. The best performance on P3HT:PCBM organic solar cells was produced by SWCNTs:Coumarin (CC) hybrids which were coated on an indium tin oxide coated polyethylene terephthalate film (ITO-PET). The reference device based on the P3HT:PCBM blend without CC showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.16%, an FF of 35% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.51 mA cm−2. The reference device with CC hybrids within the P3HT:PCBM blend increased the values significantly to 1.62% for PCE, 40% for FF and 6.8 mA cm−2 for Jsc.

Due to rapid developments in societies and increase in energy consumption in line with industrial development and climate change, energy demand is considered as one of the major problems that the world community will face sooner or later. Nowadays, energy consumption is extremely dependent on fossil fuel resources such as petrol, natural gas and coal. The greatest challenge for the world community is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels especially by switching partly and gradually to renewable energies, which therefore requires major development in the energy infrastructure. Several projects have been carried out by scientists who have particularly identified renewable energy with different resources such as water, wind, bio-materials and solar radiation. Among all these renewable resources, solar energy has drawn increasing interest from researchers and industry alike due to its viability in applications such as powering street lights, distribution around homes, schools, and business areas. The rate of solar radiation intercepted by the Earth is about 20000 times greater than the amount of energy consumed by all humanity. Additionally, the solar power resource exceeds all other renewable alternatives, but breakthroughs in energy production remain limited because of the high cost and the intermittent nature of solar radiation especially in regions with cold climates. Solar energy technologies are experiencing rapid growth and possibly within the next 40 years, they will be one of the leading major global energy resources. The solar radiation comes in the form of electromagnetic radiation of a wide spectrum ranging from high-energy (short wavelength) to low-energy (long-wavelength). The solar spectrum covers ultraviolet (UV) radiation ranging from 100–400 nm, visible radiation ranging from 400–700 nm and infrared (IR) radiation (700 nm and above). UV, visible and infrared radiation are significant parts of the solar spectrum, which play an important role in global solar energy applications including solar thermal energy and photovoltaics (PV). To date, different types of solar cells have been demonstrated which are classified into three different generations; the distinction between these generations basically lies in the kinds of materials used. The first generation consists of cells prepared by using crystalline silicon (Si) whereas the second generation solar cells are based on semiconductor thin film technology; these include amorphous silicon (a-Si), polycrystalline silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) based solar cells. The third generation solar cells are based on a range of new materials, such as organic polymers, small molecules, nanotubes, quantum dots, silicon nanowires, and organic dyes. Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be cost-effective, lightweight and suitable for roll-to-roll technology and can be prepared via simple solution processing methods on flexible substrates. Among several organic materials, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends are the most investigated donor/acceptor materials in OSCs. The nanoscale interpenetrated network morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blend is a crucial factor in order to achieve a higher solar cell performance, through facilitating charge carrier separation and transfer, where the exciton diffusion length is in the range between 10–20 nm. Furthermore, ternary blends are considered as an encouraging model to increase OSC performance by either increasing charge carriers’ mobility or incorporation of complementary optical materials or both. The incorporation of functional materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or graphene with unique properties make them promising materials for ternary blend composites. In a recent research study, it has been shown that the use of carbon based hybrids has resulted in enhancing the performance of P3HT:PCBM based OSCs to achieve 5.3% efficiency compared to 3.5% for a reference P3HT:PCBM based device. Generally, SWCNTs and rGO might have some drawbacks when they are added to the active layer due to the possible contribution in compromising the device shunt resistance, as well as acting as charge recombination centers. Therefore, small proportions of carbon-based functional materials are used in ternary blend-based OSCs.

In the current study, new hybrids based on single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) functionalized with BODIPY and coumarin derivatives (Scheme 1) have been synthesized and investigated to enhance the performance of P3HT:PCBM based OSCs. Keeping this in mind, we have focused on BODIPY and coumarin functionalized nanocarbon hybrid based OSCs. These molecules show outstanding photophysical properties such as a high molar extinction coefficient of absorbance, high fluorescence quantum yield, and excellent photostability. BODIPY shows excellent performance as a functional dye when it is used in chemosensors, bioprobes, photodynamic therapy, organic light-emitting diodes, and solar cell devices. Coumarin derivatives are also widely used as commercially significant organic fluorescent materials having, due to their large Stokes shift, sufficient fluorescence in the visible light range, good solubility and high fluorescence quantum yield. Moreover, coumarin based dyes with their good photo-response in the visible region, long term stability under 1 sun illumination, and appropriately located LUMO level have shown better performance in photovoltaic devices.

All reagents and solvents are of reagent grade quality and are obtained from commercial suppliers: 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid and 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and sodium L-ascorbate was purchased from Alfa Aesar. SWCNTs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium azide and copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate were supplied from Merck. Reduced graphene oxide used as a graphene nanomaterial was obtained from Zerre, the brand of Hazerfen KMETSTAŞ (Hazarfen Chemicals Materials and Energy Technologies and Trade Inc.) Company, Turkey. The surface area of this rGO as deduced from BET measurements (Quantachrome Instruments) and the ratio of C:O from scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX, Philips XL 30 SFEG) were measured as 565 m2 g−1 and 4.77, respectively. The number of layers determined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, Digital Instruments) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN) was in the range of 4–7 sheets and the lateral size of rGO flakes was approximately 5 μm. Moreover, for solar cell applications, the following materials have been used to prepare the solar cell devices: poly(3-hexylthiophine-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) 1.3 wt% dispersion in H2O (conductive grade), chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification. ITO-coated glass slides (sheet resistant of 8–12 Ω sq−1) were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.


4,4′-Difluoro-8-(4-hydroxy)-phenyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (1) was synthesized and purified according to the literature procedure. 4,4′-Difluoro-8-(4-propynyloxy)-phenyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (2) (BODIPY) was synthesized and purified according to literature procedures. 7-Hydroxy-3-(3′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl) coumarin (3) was synthesized and purified according to the literature procedure.


Compound 3 (400 mg, 1.218 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL DMF and propargyl bromide (0.02 mL, 1.827 mmol) was added to the solution. After stirring for 10 min, K2CO3 (252 mg, 1.827 mmol) was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was heated at 60 °C for 24 h under an argon atmosphere. Then the resulting mixture was poured into ice water. The precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using dichloromethane as an eluent.

SWCNT-N3 and rGO-N3 were synthesized according to the method given in the literature. 250 mg (3.84 mmol) NaN3 and 165 mg (1.01 mmol) iodine monochloride were dissolved in 25 mL acetonitrile (ACN) under a nitrogen atmosphere. This mixture was magnetically stirred for 15 min at 0 °C followed by addition of 20 mg SWCNTs or rGO to the solution; the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours and filtered. The solid products were washed with DMF and ethanol to remove excess unreacted compounds and dried under vacuum.


Hybrid materials were synthesized according to the modified method described in our earlier publication. 20 mg (0.012 mmol) of BODIPY (2) or coumarin (4) was dissolved in 2 mL DMF separately and then sonicated for 15 min at room temperature. On the other hand, 5 mg SWCNT-N3 (or rGO-N3) was suspended separately in 2 mL DMF and sonicated for 30 min at room temperature; BODIPY (2) or coumarin (4) solutions were then added dropwise to the SWCNT-N3 (or rGO-N3) suspension. To this suspension, 1.0 mol% copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate and 5.0 mol% sodium L-ascorbate in 1 mL water were added at room temperature as catalysts and the resulting mixture was kept overnight at 90 °C. Finally, the reaction mixture was centrifuged twice with water, ethanol and dichloromethane in sequence and dried in a vacuum. A synthesis pathway of graphene or SWCNT hybrids is shown in Scheme 2.

BODIPY, coumarin, SWCNTs and rGO as hybrids were examined using different techniques such as FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, 1H-NMR, MALDI mass spectra, SEM, cyclic voltammetry and electrical conductivity measurements. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrophotometer. Raman spectra were recorded with a Triplemate, SPEX spectrometer equipped with a CCD detector in a back-scattering geometry. The 488 nm, 40 mW line of an Ar-laser was used for the spectral excitation. 1H-NMR spectra with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard were recorded on a Varian 500 MHz spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded on a Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Bruker Microflex LT using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) as the matrix. A UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian 50-scan UV-visible) in the range of 190–1100 nm was used to record the absorption spectra. The morphologies of the synthesized hybrids were determined by FEI-Nova scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry measurements were carried out with a CH Instruments 440B Electrochemical analyzer utilizing a three-electrode configuration at 25 °C. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode. A Pt wire served as the counter electrode. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) employed as the reference electrode was separated from the bulk of the solution by a double bridge. Electrochemical grade tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) was employed as the supporting electrolyte in voltammetric measurements in extra pure dichloromethane (DCM) at a concentration of 0.10 mol dm−3. High purity N2 was used to deoxygenate the solution at least 10 minutes prior to each run and maintains a nitrogen blanket. All theoretical calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 16 program suite. The molecular geometries of the BODIPY and coumarin compounds were optimized by the density functional theory (DFT)-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) basis set. The excited states were calculated by using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT calculations) B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and B3PW91/6-311G(d,p) in DCM. The molecular orbital contours were visualized using Gauss view 5.0.9. The thickness of the deposited layers was determined using a M2000 (J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.) spectroscopic ellipsometer operating in the wavelength range of 370–1000 nm. The photovoltaic properties in the form of current density–voltage (J–V) dependence were measured using a 4200 Keithley semiconductor characterization system and the photocurrent was generated under an AM 1.5 solar simulator source of 100 mW cm−2. The fill factor (FF) and the overall light-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells were determined according to the following equations:

Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage which is generally defined as the difference between the HOMO donor and LUMO acceptor,Pin is the incident light power and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the point of maximum power output in the J–V curves, respectively.


P3HT:PCBM blends were mixed with functionalised carbon nanomaterials to produce a ternary active layer blend in a concentration ratio of 0.01 mg:14 mg of functionalised carbon nanomaterials to the P3HT:PCBM blend as higher concentrations may result in device failure through short circuit; these hybrids were dissolved in a co-solvent comprising chlorobenzene and chloroform in the ratio of 1:1. The solutions were stirred overnight at 45 °C prior to film deposition. ITO coated glass slides were cleaned using deionised water, acetone and 2-propanol for 10 min each in an ultrasonic bath, respectively, and then blow dried in N2 gas. PEDOT:PSS layers were spin coated on the clean ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heat-treatment at 150 °C for 10 min in ambient air. Subsequently, PEDOT:PSS layer coated ITO substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box where the active layers were spin coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s to obtain a thickness of ∼150 nm and then heat-treated inside the glove box at 120 °C for 10 min. Aluminium (Al) was thermally evaporated as a back electrode using an Edward thermal deposition system with a thickness of ∼100 nm under vacuum of ∼2 × 10−6 mbar, at the deposition rate of 0.1–0.2 nm s−1 as was detected by a quartz crystal thickness monitor. All final devices were subjected to further heat-treatment inside the nitrogen-filled glove box at 120 °C for 10 min.


Compound 2 (Scheme 1) was synthesized and purified according to the literature procedure. Compound 3 was also synthesized and purified according to the literature procedure. The novel 7-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)-3-(3′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)-coumarin was prepared by the reaction of 7-hydroxy-3-(3′,4′,5′-trimethoxyphenyl)coumarin with propargyl bromide in DMF. SWCNTs and rGO bearing azido groups were synthesized by the reaction of SWCNTs or rGO with sodium azide in the presence of iodine monochloride in acetonitrile (Scheme 2). The target SWCNTs and rGO hybrid materials CB, CC, GB and GC were prepared through the reaction of azido substituted SWCNTs or rGO with the newly synthesized terminal ethynyl bearing coumarin or BODIPY derivatives by the azide–alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition (click) reaction in DMF using copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate and sodium L-ascorbate as catalysts (Scheme 2).

The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 4 was recorded in CDCl3 solution (Fig. S2, ESI). The ethynyl proton was observed at 2.60 ppm as a singlet. The methoxy protons were observed at 3.90 and 3.93 ppm as singlet peaks. The aliphatic protons of the CH2 group were observed at 4.80 ppm as a doublet. The proton in the fourth position of the coumarin lactone ring was observed at 7.76 ppm as a singlet. The aromatic protons were observed at 7.49, 7.00, 6.96 and 6.94 ppm as a doublet, singlet, double doublet and singlet, respectively.

Hybrid nanomaterials of BODIPY and coumarin functionalized SWCNTs and rGO were obtained as powders. SEM images of the films of the novel hybrids are shown in Fig. S3. GC and GB films have demonstrated flake like features, while tube like features have been observed in the cases of CC and CB hybrids. Formation of CB, CC, GB and GC hybrid nanomaterials was confirmed by the methods of FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the FT-IR spectra of free BODIPY, free coumarin, rGO-N3, SWCNT-N3, CB, CC, GB and GC hybrids. BODIPY compound exhibited vibration peaks at 3261 and 1491 cm−1 assigned to the CCH and B–N stretching vibrations, respectively. Additionally, coumarin compounds exhibited vibration peaks at 3260, 1719 and 1218 cm−1 assigned to the CCH, CO lactone and Ar–O–C stretchings, respectively. On the other hand, the addition of N3 groups to SWCNTs or rGO was identified with the observation of a peak at 2100 cm−1 for the –NNN (azide) vibration in the FT-IR spectra of SWCNTs-N3 or rGO-N3. The CH peaks in the FT-IR spectra of BODIPY and coumarin compounds and N3 peaks for SWCNTs-N3 or rGO-N3 compounds disappeared after the formation of hybrid nanomaterials (Fig. 1). Additionally, the vibration peak for the CH stretching of the triazole ring, observed at around 3200 cm−1 for all hybrids (Fig. S4), was additional proof of the functionalization of SWCNTs or rGO with BODIPY or coumarin moieties.

The Raman spectra of SWCNTs, CC and CB hybrids are shown in Fig. 2(A), while the Raman spectra of rGO and its GC and GB hybrids are presented in Fig. 2(B). The spectra of both SWCNTs and the hybrids (Fig. 2(A)) contain the characteristic peaks typical for carbon nanomaterials, namely the D band at around 1340 cm−1 (disorder mode) and the G band (tangential mode) at 1592 cm−1. The ID/IG ratio has a value of 0.04 in the spectrum of pure SWCNTs, while the values of 0.20 and 0.15 were obtained from the spectra of CC and CB, respectively. The inset of Fig. 2(A) shows the enlarged part of the spectrum from 50 to 1470 cm−1. The characteristic bands corresponding to vibrations of coumarin and BODIPY moieties are noticeable in the spectra of CC and CB (Fig. 2(A), inset). A comparison of the spectra of the hybrids with those of coumarin and BODIPY shows that some characteristic vibrations of coumarin and BODIPY moieties are shifted noticeably due to the covalent bonding with SWCNTs. The RBMs of SWCNTs in the range of 158–304 cm−1 (Fig. 2(A)) are ascribed to a distribution of diameters in the SWCNTs, which corresponds to nanotube diameters in the range of 0.7 to 1.4 nm. Considerable changes are observed in the spectra of CC and CB in the range of RBM modes. The intensities of most of RBMs decreased and only two bands at 199 and 221 cm−1 in the spectrum of CC and three bands at 164, 200 and 222 cm−1 in the spectrum of CB remain pronounced. The rGO sample displays two peaks at 1358 cm−1 and 1598 cm−1 corresponding to the D band and G bands, respectively (Fig. 2(B)). In contrast to the case of rGO, the G bands in GC and GB spectra shift to 1586 cm−1. The low-frequency peak shift is assigned to the interaction between the coumarin and BODIPY moieties with rGO sheets. The noticeable change of the ID/IG ratio provides further indication of rGO functionalisation. Moreover, there are many bands corresponding to coumarin and BODIPY moieties overlapping with D band and G bands of rGO, thus indicating that coumarin and BODIPY molecules are attached to the carbon nanomaterials.

Thermal stabilities of the hybrids in comparison with pristine BODIPY, coumarin, SWCNTs, and rGO were examined by TGA weight loss in around 100 °C, as the samples were completely dried before testing to eliminate the influence of absorbed moisture on the results. Fig. 3 presents TGA thermograms, recorded under a N2 atmosphere. The TGA data show weight losses for SWCNTs, rGO, SWCNT-N3, rGO-N3, CB, CC, GB, GC, BODIPY and coumarin at 800 °C: these are 4.70, 11.51, 12.68, 32.18, 28.43, 30.13, 41.46, 50.48, 50.07 and 63.65%, respectively. The thermograms of pristine SWCNTs, SWCNT-N3, rGO and rGO-N3 revealed their excellent thermal resistance of up to 800 °C. Weight losses due to the functional groups on SWCNTs were estimated to be 8.43, 17.45 and 15.75% for SWCNT-N3, CC and CB, respectively. The number of the azide groups on the SWCNTs were calculated as described in the literature. The number of azide functional groups in SWCNT-N3 was estimated to be 1 per 38 carbon atoms. The amount of coumarin molecules covalently anchored on the surface of the nanotubes as the real ratio was 27.41% (17.45%/63.65%). It was estimated that CC contains one coumarin molecule per 81 carbon atoms according to the calculation of (72.59% × 366.10)/(27.41% × 12). Similarly, the amount of BODIPY molecules bonded on the surface of the nanotubes as a real ratio was 31.45% (15.75%/50.07%). It was calculated that CB contains one BODIPY molecule per 69 carbon atoms according to the calculation of ((72.59% × 366.10)/(27.41% × 12)). In addition, the number of azide functional groups in rGO-N3 was 1 per 14 carbon atoms and the amounts of coumarin and BODIPY bonded on rGO as real ratios were 28.75% (18.30%/63.65%) and 18.53% (9.28%/50.07%), respectively. The calculations indicated that GC contained one coumarin per 76 carbon atoms and GB contained one BODIPY per 138 carbon atoms. TGA results showed that hybrid materials were more stable than BODIPY and coumarin. This could be explained by the thermal stability of the hybrids after functionalization by BODIPY or coumarin groups that makes them useful materials for applications in electronic devices.


Coumarin and BODIPY functionalized SWCNTs and rGO hybrid nanomaterials (CB, CC, GB and GC) were dispersed in DMF (0.25 mg mL−1); 20 μL from each solution was added to 3 mL DMF for investigation of optical absorption spectra. While pristine BODIPY and coumarin derivatives (2 and 4) are soluble in DMF, their hybrids (CC, CB, GC and GB) exhibited good dispersion in this solvent (Fig. S5).

The UV-visible absorption spectra of CC, CB, GC and GB hybrids compared to those of pristine BODIPY and coumarin derivatives are shown in Fig. 4. The spectra of BODIPY and coumarin compounds showed characteristic absorptions at 500 and 347 nm, respectively. A small bathochromic shift (2–3 nm) of the absorption bands in the spectra of the hybrids compared to those of pristine BODIPY and coumarin was observed; while the absorption intensities decreased the absorption bands appeared broadened. Presumably, the shift of the bands is not significant because the interaction of carbon nanomaterials with BODIPY or coumarin via formation of the triazole ring does not affect the aromatic systems of the molecules and consequently does not much alter their electronic properties. It was revealed that such spectra give an obvious indication of the ground-state electronic interactions between BODIPY or coumarin and graphene or SWCNTs within the hybrid materials. The broad coverage of the absorption spectra over the UV-Vis-NIR regions could result in improved light-harvesting properties. The energy band gaps (Eg) of BODIPY, coumarin and their hybrids with rGO or SWCNTs were estimated using the intersection points of absorption and emission spectra of thin films of the investigated compounds (Table S1). BODIPY and coumarin exhibited band gaps Eg = 2.44 and 2.85 eV, respectively. The band gaps for CB, CC, GB and GC hybrids were 2.39, 2.77, 2.37 and 2.80 eV, respectively. These optical band gap values indicated that these hybrid materials are potentially applicable as solar cell materials.
For a better understanding of the structural and electronic features of these molecules, the DFT theoretical calculations were further performed, and the optimized structures and the electronic distribution in the HOMO and LUMO levels are presented in Fig. S6. All calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 16 program suite by using the B3LYP and B3PW91 methods and 6-311 G (d,p) and basis set. The optimized ground-state geometries of these molecules are shown in Fig. S6. The electron distributions of BODIPY and coumarin were 2.89 and 3.39 for B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) indicating that the π-electrons in the HOMO are delocalized over the entire molecular backbone offering effective orbital interactions among the stacked π-systems. Computational band gaps have similar values to the optical and electrical band gaps. These results indicate that hybrid materials prepared from these molecules are also potentially applicable in photovoltaic (PV) applications.
The cyclic voltammograms of BODIPY and coumarin are illustrated in Fig. S7. As shown in this figure, BODIPY presents reversible onset oxidation potential at around 1.22 V, and a reversible reduction at around −1.17 V. The coumarin compound presents a reversible oxidation and a reversible reduction potential at 1.22 and −1.71 V, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms of CC, CB, GC and GB hybrids are illustrated in Fig. S8 and the values are presented in Table S1. As shown in this figure, CB and GB exhibit irreversible onset oxidation potentials at around 0.81 and 0.83 V, and irreversible reductions at around −1.04 and −0.77 V. The coumarin based hybrids (CC and GC) revealed irreversible oxidation and irreversible reduction potentials at 1.31, 1.17 V and −1.35, −1.26 V, respectively.
The HOMO and low LUMO energy levels of the materials were calculated and the results are presented in Table S1. The corresponding HOMO energy levels of BODIPY, coumarin, CC, CB, GC and GB hybrids were calculated to be −5.88, −5.95, −6.04, −5.54, −5.90, and −5.56 eV using the equation EHOMO (eV) = −(Eonsetox − EonsetFc/Fc+) − 5.13 eV. The LUMO energy levels of these compounds were determined to be −3.56, −3.02, −3.38, −3.69, −3.47 and −3.96 eV, respectively using the following equation: ELUMO (eV) = −(Eonsetred − EonsetFc/Fc+) − 5.13 eV (Table S1). These hybrids are actually located at very low energy level, which is an attractive property in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices. Different oxidation and reduction peaks were exhibited by the different hybrids in the scanned electrochemical window. Coumarin and BODIPY bonded with SWCNTs or rGO exhibited broadened redox peaks which were attributed to low solubility and strong aggregation in solution. Fig. 5 shows the energy level alignments of BODIPY, coumarin and their hybrids. The energy level alignment was assumed to be occurring between P3HT/CC, P3HT/CB, P3HT/GC and P3HT/GB. It was known that the main mechanisms in the OSC operation are based on exciton generation, separation and dissociation with charge separation mainly taking place at the interface between the two materials (donor/acceptor) within the blends. Carbon-based hybrids are also likely to act as p-type materials, and it was demonstrated that P3HT/SWCNTs and P3HT/rGO hybrids may act as hole transport layers.

To investigate the solar cell performances, thin films of P3HT:PCBM blended with the novel hybrids (reduced graphene oxide:BODIPY (GB), reduced graphene oxide:Coumarin (GC), SWCNTs:BODIPY (CB) and SWCNTs:Coumarin (CC)) were prepared. The absorption spectra of the P3HT:PCBM films with and without the addition of the hybrids are shown in Fig. 6. Typical absorption spectra have been observed for the P3HT:PCBM blends with four different bands. Bands a, b and c were attributed to the absorption spectra of the P3HT whereas band d is ascribed to the absorption spectrum of PCBM. The ternary blend is well-known as a promising concept to improve the OSC performance, which could be achieved by either incorporation of a complementary optical material or a material with higher charge carrier mobility or both. The effect of the absorption properties of P3HT:PCBM blends as a result of adding a small portion of the studied hybrids has been analyzed. All the studied hybrids have shown no clear change or shift in the absorption peaks of the P3HT:PCBM due to the small addition of the hybrids within the P3HT:PCBM blend. It is worth noting that the band gap and the energy level alignment of the P3HT:PCBM blends might result in enhancing the light absorption properties. The optimization of carbon-based blends used in OSCs could be attained when small proportions of these materials are used. However, the use of SWCNTs or rGO has some drawbacks in solar cell applications such as their possible contribution in compromising the device shunt resistance, as well as acting as charge recombination centres.

The photovoltaic properties of the novel GB, GC, CB and CC hybrids have been investigated as ternary blends with P3HT:PCBM, separately, as shown in Fig. 7; the results of the PV characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The new hybrids (GB, GC, CB and CC) were added to the main (P3HT:PCBM) blends in a small portion in order to avoid any possible short-circuit as the hybrids are based on carbon based materials. The reference device based on the pure P3HT:PCBM blend has displayed a PCE of 2.62% with a FF of 60% and a Jsc of 7.1 mA cm−2. The P3HT:PCBM:GB based device has shown a PCE of 2.9% with a Jsc of 8.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.6 and a FF of 55%. On the other hand, the P3HT:PCBM:CB based device has exhibited an increase in the Jsc to 9.1 mA cm−2 and no change in the device Voc, whereas FF has increased to 59% and the PCE increased to 3.22. The increase in the PCE is mainly attributed to the increase in the current density which is in turn might be ascribed to the addition of the BODIPY group within the P3HT:PCBM blend. Recently, BODIPY dyes have been used in dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications due to their strong absorption and fluorescence behaviour in the visible and the near-infrared regions. A solar cell device may be affected by many factors, including aggregation, light absorption coverage, loading density, frontier molecular orbital energy levels as well as redox couple potential. Moreover, the PCE is the result of a global optimization of various processes. For example, a dye with a broader light absorption can harvest more photons for electron generation, which was achieved by lowering the LUMO or increasing the HOMO levels. CB and GB have a broad absorption and narrow band gaps with the lower LUMO and higher HOMO levels compared to the pristine BODIPY dye, and thus the PCE of the hybrid materials increased considerably.

Also, the functional carbon based groups have a clear influence on the device performance due to their unique properties, especially, the nanoscale interpenetrated network and the electrical conductivity which might result in efficient charge transfer within the blend and thus improving the PCE. The latter improvements could also contribute to enhancement of the shunt resistance by creating percolation pathways which facilitate charge carriers’ transport and increase the short circuit current density. Furthermore, the P3HT:PCBM:GC based device has demonstrated a PCE of 2.85% with a Jsc of 8.65 mA cm−2 while the P3HT:PCBM:CC based device has exhibited the highest PCE of 3.59% with Jsc of 8.95 mA cm−2. The increase in the Jsc could be attributed to light-harvesting and effective charge transfer. Generally, coumarin exhibits sufficient fluorescence in the visible light range, with good solubility and high quantum yield. Extended conjugation in coumarin resulted in an enhancement of solar cell efficiency. Electrons on the trimethoxy groups in the coumarin were causing the conjugation to increase in the benzene ring and improve the electron transfer ability. These special properties in the coumarin molecule also caused an increase in solar cell performance. The increase in the Jsc has been confirmed using internal power conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements as shown in Fig. 8. All the devices have shown response spectra similar to the absorption spectra of their active layers with wide ranges from around 610 nm to 300 nm.
As the best results have been achieved by using SWCNTs:Coumarin hybrids in the P3HT:PCBM blend, the use of this ternary blend has been investigated for flexible OSCs using indium tin oxide coated polyethylene terephthalate films (ITO-PET) as substrates, as shown in Fig. 9. The reference device based on the P3HT:PCBM blend has shown a PCE of 1.16%, a FF of 35%, a Jsc of 5.51 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.6 V. The J(V) characteristics of flexible solar cells of the reference and the hybrid-based devices, both in the dark and under illumination, are demonstrated in Fig. 10. Using the SWCNTs:Coumarin hybrids within the P3HT:PCBM blend has increased the device PCE to 1.62%, FF to 40% and Jsc to 6.8 mA cm−2 as summarised in Table 2. These results clearly demonstrate that the new ternary hybrids are promising materials in improving the photovoltaic properties.

In the current study, thin films of P3HT:PCBM blended with the novel reduced graphene oxide:BODIPY (GB), reduced graphene oxide:Coumarin (GC), SWCNTs:BODIPY (CB) and SWCNTs:Coumarin (CC) hybrid nanomaterials were prepared. The structures of the BODIPY and coumarin compounds were determined by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis, while their hybrid materials were characterized by FT-IR, Raman, UV-Vis spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The surface morphology of these hybrid films was determined by SEM. Absorption spectra of the hybrids in the P3HT:PCBM blend showed higher variations in the absorption peak positions as compared to P3HT:PCBM. The Eg values were estimated using the Tauc equation in the UV-visible absorption spectra as 2.44 eV for BODIPY, 2.85 eV for coumarin, 2.39 eV for CB, 2.77 eV for CC, 2.37 eV for GB and 2.80 eV for GC. The highest value for the solar cell efficiency on ITO glass at 8.95 mA cm−2 was calculated to be 3.59%. This corresponded to an increase of 37% efficiency with CC.
