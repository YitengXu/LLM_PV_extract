We report organic solar cells (OSCs) with subwavelength architectured polydimethylsiloxane (SWA-PDMS) as an antireflective (AR) layer on a glass substrate for not only enhancing the efficiency but also increasing the transparency of the devices. These subwavelength architectures (SWAs) on PDMS layers are fabricated using a soft imprint lithography technique via an anodic aluminum oxide mold. The effect of optical characteristics of SWA-PDMS with respect to the period and diameter of SWAs, along with the theoretical analysis using rigorous coupled-wave analysis simulation, is investigated. Consequently, the SWA-PDMS/glass with a period and diameter of 125 nm and 80 nm, respectively, is obtained as the optimal sample, exhibiting the highest average transmittance (Tavg) of ∼95.2%, which is much higher compared to that of bare glass (Tavg ∼92.08%). By employing the optimal SWA-PDMS on the glass surface of opaque and semitransparent OSCs as an AR layer, their power conversion efficiency is improved from 8.67 to 10.59% and 7.07 to 8.52%, respectively. Additionally, the average visible transmittance (AVT) of the semitransparent OSC is increased from 23.0 to 26.2% with significantly improved color coordinates as the AR layer is employed. Also, the OSCs with SWA-PDMS having a relatively high hydrophobic nature exhibit a stable performance in the ambient environment.

In the past few years, there has been tremendous interest in the development of eco-friendly sustainable energy harvesting systems to meet the increasing demands arising from the global energy crisis and to effectively substitute the conventional power supplies. Particularly, solar cells have promising potential to efficiently harvest solar energy, which is clean, inexhaustible, and the most abundant among renewable energies. Among the various solar cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention because of their low material/processing cost, simple fabrication process, high throughput, light weight, and compatibility with flexible substrates over a large area. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSCs has been improved rapidly through material engineering and device optimization with the highest PCE achieved by being over 13%. It is interesting that the optimized thickness of the organic photoactive layer is typically less than 300 nm due to the relatively higher extinction coefficient and lower charge transport characteristics as compared to its inorganic counterparts. This affords partial light transparency, which can contribute to an interesting feature of semitransparent solar cells. Semitransparent cells have received significant attention in recent years due to their promising applications in wearable energy resources and building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). However, the PCEs of semitransparent OSCs are generally inferior to those of opaque devices due to the loss of reflected light from the transparent top electrode. In other words, the semitransparent devices harvest incident light only, resulting in limited photocurrent generation. Therefore, light harvesting or light trapping technology is very important to improve the photovoltaic performance of semitransparent OSCs for practical applications.

One of the viable strategies for enhancing the light absorption and trapping in the active layer of OSCs is the utilization of an antireflection (AR) layer on the external surface of transparent substrates. For this reason, the AR layers on OSCs can effectively reduce the reflection losses at the surface of transparent substrates or at the interfaces in between the thin layers (i.e., stacked to fabricate OSCs), which results in enhanced light absorption in the active layer of the devices. The utilization of AR layers for semitransparent OSCs is quite attractive to further enhance their transparency and also more effective for window or BIPV applications. In addition, attachment of AR layers onto the OSCs is a cost-effective method that does not require any complex processing such as vacuum deposition or high temperature.
Over the past few years, various nano- and/or micro-architectured polymer materials such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polycarbonate, and polymethyl methacrylate have been used as an AR layer to efficiently enhance the PCE of solar cells. Soft imprinting lithography (SIL) techniques have been generally used to develop these nano- and/or micro-architectures on polymers via corresponding master molds. Although SIL is facile and cost-effective, the fabrication of nano- and/or micro-architectures on polymers requires corresponding master molds which involve expensive and complicated fabrication processes such as nanoimprint lithography, laser interference lithography, electron-beam lithography, colloidal spheres, thermally dewetted metal nanoparticles,etc., including a subsequent dry etching. In contrast, anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) molds can be easily prepared by a relatively simple, fast, and cost-effective electrochemical oxidation of bulk aluminum. Thus, AAO molds with two-dimensional (2D) periodic hexagonally close-packed nanopores are a good alternative.
In this work, we fabricated subwavelength architectured polydimethylsiloxane (SWA-PDMS) layers using a SIL technique using AAO master molds. Their optical characteristics, together with the results of rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) simulations, on glass substrates, were also investigated and optimized. By laminating SWA-PDMS as an AR layer on the glass substrates of opaque and semitransparent OSCs, its effects on device characteristics, such as current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) including their stability, were explored. Additionally, we systematically investigated the effect of the SWA-PDMS layer on the optical properties of the semitransparent devices.


Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the process steps for the fabrication of subwavelength architectures (SWAs) on the surface of the PDMS layer by the SIL technique using AAO master molds. The field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images of AAO molds with different periods (100, 125, and 450 nm) and diameters (50, 60, 80, and 100 nm) are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI), respectively. As shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI), the AAO molds consist of 2D periodic hexagonally close-packed nano-architectures (or nanopores). To efficiently replicate these nano-architectures without any deformation and distortion, an h-PDMS (i.e., hard PDMS) solution was spin-coated onto the AAO mold and then cured. Subsequently, an s-PDMS (i.e., soft PDMS) solution was poured and cured on the h-PDMS/AAO mold, which can serve as a protective layer on the stiff h-PDMS, enable manual application in a nondestructive manner, and also support easy attachment to/detachment from flat surfaces. However, the cured PDMS layer (h-PDMS/s-PDMS) with the SWAs was carefully peeled off from the AAO mold. Finally, the as-fabricated SWA-PDMS layer was laminated on the glass surface of OSCs as an AR and protective cover layer to demonstrate its device feasibility (Fig. 1b). The normal device architecture of OSCs constructed with various thin-films deposited on an ITO coated glass substrate is schematically represented in Fig. 1b. The SEM image of the SWA-PDMS layer laminated on the glass surface of the OSC device is shown in Fig. 1c. The SEM image of the SWA-PDMS clearly reveals that the SWAs with the 2D periodic hexagonal symmetry are uniformly distributed on the surface of the PDMS layer, and its diameter/period was noted as ∼80 nm/125 nm, respectively. Fig. 1d also depicts the cross-sectional SEM image of the OSC device, indicating that the device consists of a normal architecture of glass/indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/bulk heterojunction/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag).


Fig. 2a shows the measured total transmittance spectra of bare glass, flat-PDMS, and SWA-PDMS layers with various periods (100, 125, and 450 nm) on the glass. The SEM images of the corresponding SWA-PDMS layers with periods (P) of 100, 125, and 450 nm (i.e., P-100, P-125, and P-450) are shown in Fig. S3a–c (ESI). For comparison, the SEM image of flat-PDMS is also shown in Fig. S3d (ESI). As shown in Fig. S3d, the flat-PDMS is not composed of any nano-architectures on its surface, which is replicated by a flat Si mold. In contrast, the SWA-PDMS layers comprise SWAs with a 2D periodic hexagonal symmetry on the PDMS surface. Additionally, the height/diameter of these SWAs was noted as ∼85/140 nm, 100/150 nm, and 115/210 nm for P100, P125, and P450, respectively, and these dimensions are almost similar to those of the corresponding AAO molds, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). However, these SWA-PDMS layers with different periods were further laminated on bare glass to examine their optical characteristics (Fig. 2a and b). The inset of Fig. 2a shows the photographic image (left) of the SWA-PDMS(P-125) layer on bare glass, which can show its ease of lamination and detachability function. The inset also depicts the 30°-tilted view SEM image (right) of the SWA-PDMS(P-125) layer. It is clearly observable that most of the SWAs on the surface of PDMS are formed like a bundle. This may be attributed to a small gap and a strong van der Waals force between the SWAs. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the total transmittance of bare glass is significantly improved by laminating the PDMS layers with or without SWAs. The average transmission (Tavg) value of bare glass over the wavelength range of 350–800 nm is slightly increased from ∼92.0 to 92.95%, and the enhancement percentage is only about 0.9%. Such a small enhancement is mainly observed due to a step gradient refractive index (GRIN) profile between air (n ≈ 1) and bare glass (n ≈ 1.53) via a PDMS (n ≈ 1.43) layer. In contrast, the SWA-PDMS/glass with the periods of 100 and 125 nm exhibited a high total transmittance over a wide wavelength range of 350–800 nm, indicating Tavg values of ∼93.90 and 94.65%, respectively. These values are higher than those of the bare glass and flat PDMS/glass as well as the SWA-PDMS(P-450)/glass (i.e., Tavg ∼91.47%). This behavior of the SWA-PDMS/glass with the periods of 100 and 125 nm is mainly attributed to the nano-architectures (i.e., SWAs) on the PDMS layer with the periods smaller (i.e., 100 and 125 nm) than the incident wavelengths, which can help to efficiently reduce the surface reflectance, resulting in a high total transmittance. Furthermore, these SWAs can also produce a continuous linear GRIN between air and the PDMS as well as the zeroth-order transmitted wave. However, out of both the PDMS layers, the SWA-PDMS(P-125)/glass exhibited a higher Tavg value compared to the SWA-PDMS(P-100)/glass owing to a large period or gap between the SWAs because it can provide a more linear GRIN as well as a larger transmittance. On the other hand, the SWA-PDMS(P-450)/glass exhibited the lowest Tavg as compared to the other samples and also showed a low transmittance (<90%) region over the wavelength range of 380–550 nm. These results may be caused by the diffraction losses at wavelengths shorter than the periods of SWAs.
Moreover, to examine the influence of transmittance properties of these SWA-PDMS layers on the solar cell performance, the solar photon flux-weighted transmittance (TSW) was evaluated. The TSW, which is defined as the ratio between the usable photons transmitted to the total usable photons, can be evaluated using the following equation:
(1)
where
Is(λ) is the solar spectral photon flux (i.e., AM1.5G) and T(λ) is the measured total transmittance (Fig. 2a). As predicted, the SWA-PDMS(P-125)/glass exhibited a higher TSW value of ∼94.5% as compared to the other samples (i.e., TSW ∼92.7% for the flat-PDMS/glass and TSW ∼93.8 and 91.6% for the SWA-PDMS/glass with the periods of 100 and 450 nm, respectively) as well as bare glass (TSW ∼91.9%). For all these samples, the photonic flux density (PFD), which is the number of photons transmitted across the sample, was also estimated to analyze their transmittance characteristics at specific wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Resultantly, the PFD identifies that the solar cell with these samples (as an AR layer) can produce photocurrent at specific wavelengths in the solar spectrum. The PFD is defined as

(2)
where
Is, T, and hν denote the spectral irradiance (i.e., AM1.5G), the total transmittance (in Fig. 2a), and the photon energy, respectively. Fig. 2b shows the spectral distribution of the PFD for bare glass, flat-PDMS/glass, and SWA-PDMS/glass with various periods. As shown in Fig. 2b, the SWA-PDMS(P125)/glass had a higher PFD spectral distribution than the other samples. It is clear that it exhibited a much higher PFD spectral distribution compared to the bare glass over the wavelength range of 450–800 nm, which is a high-intensity range of the solar spectrum.

From the above results, the SWA-PDMS with the period of 125 nm was found to be most effective. To further affirm it, the optical transmittance of the SWA-PDMS layers laminated on glass was also calculated using RCWA simulations and compared further with the measured results. Fig. 2c shows the calculated total transmittance spectra of the corresponding samples. The inset of Fig. 2c also shows the side- and top-view schematics of the scale-modified simulation model (left) and refractive indices (right) of glass and PDMS used in these simulations. The calculated transmittance spectra of bare glass, flat-PDMS/glass, and SWA-PDMS/glass with the periods of 100, 125, and 450 nm showed the same trend as the measured results (in Fig. 2a). In addition, the period of SWAs was varied from 0 to 500 nm with an interval of 25 nm and the influence of total transmittance of SWA-PDMS over the wavelength range of 350–800 nm (Fig. S4) was theoretically analyzed. Consequently, the RCWA simulation results demonstrate that the total transmittance or Tavg values for the SWA-PMDS are almost similar (Fig. S4), while the period of SWAs is in the range of >100 to 225 nm. Therefore, from the above theoretical simulation and experimental results, it is clear that the SWA-PDMS with the period of 125 nm is more efficient to enhance the total transmittance of glass over the wavelength range of 350–800 nm. Furthermore, the total reflectance spectra of bare glass, flat-PDMS/glass, and SWA-PDMS/glass with various SWA periods (100, 125, and 450 nm) were also evaluated, as shown in Fig. 2d. The reflectance characteristics also exhibited a similar trend to those of the transmittance characteristics. In addition, the solar photon flux-weighted reflectance (RSW) value for all these samples was also evaluated using eqn (1), by substituting reflectance (R) instead of transmittance (T). Obviously, the SWA-PDMS(P-125)/glass exhibited a lower RSW value of ∼4.68%, as compared to the other samples (i.e., RSW ∼5.13 and 5.75% for the SWA-PDMS/glass with the periods of 100 and 450 nm, respectively) as well as the bare glass (RSW ∼8.06%) and flat-PDMS/glass (RSW ∼6.58%). Overall, the above study suggests that the SWA-PDMS with the period of 125 nm and diameter of ∼100 nm is more efficient to enhance (or reduce) the total transmittance (or reflectance) of the bare glass. The effect of the diameter of SWAs on the AR characteristics of the SWA-PDMS(P-125) layer was further analyzed and optimized. During this analysis, the period of SWAs was constrained to 125 nm (Fig. 3a–c).
The SEM images of the SWA-PDMS layers with various diameters (D) of 50, 60, and 80 nm (i.e., D-50, D-60, and D-80) are shown in Fig. 3a, b, and c, respectively. From the SEM images, it could be evidently concluded that the dimensions of SWAs on the SWA-PDMS layers are almost identical to those of the corresponding AAO molds (Fig. S2, ESI). The measured total transmittance and spectral distribution of the PFD for the SWA-PDMS/glass with various diameters are shown in Fig. 3d and e, respectively. For comparison, the total transmittance and spectral distribution of the PFD for the bare glass and flat-PDMS/glass are shown in Fig. 3d and e, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3d, the total transmittance of the SWA-PDMS/glass was enhanced by increasing the diameter of SWAs from 50 to 80 nm, and it further decreased as the diameter reached 100 nm. The Tavg/TSW values of the SWA-PDMS/glass with the diameters of 50, 60, 80, and 100 nm were noted as ∼93.8%/93.7%, 94.2%/94.1%, 95.2%/95.4%, and 94.6%/94.8%, respectively, over the wavelength range of 350–800 nm. However, the SWA-PDMS(D-80)/glass exhibited the highest Tavg (or TSW) value compared to those of the other samples. Similarly, the SWA-PDMS(D-80)/glass exhibited higher PFD spectral distribution than other samples as well as bare glass (Fig. 3e). In addition, the effect of diameter of SWAs on the total transmittance of the SWA-PDMS/glass was also studied using RCWA theoretical simulations. For this study, the period and height of SWAs were assumed to be 125 nm and 150 nm, respectively. Fig. 3f shows the contour plot of the variation of the calculated total transmittance spectra of the SWA-PDMS/glass as a function of wavelength and diameter of SWAs. As shown in Fig. 3f, the SWA-PDMS/glass shows a transmittance of >94% over the wavelength range of 350–800 nm, only when the diameter of SWAs is ≥75 nm. Therefore, the theoretical simulations clarify that the SWA-PDMS(P-125) layers with the diameter of ≥75 nm are more efficient to enhance the transmittance of bare glass. The total reflectance properties of the SWA-PDMS(P-125)/glass with various diameters were also measured, as shown in Fig. 3g. As shown in Fig. 3g, the SWA-PDMS(P-125)/glass with the diameter of 80 nm exhibited the lowest total reflectance (i.e., RSW ∼4.2%) as compared to the other samples (i.e., RSW ∼5.4, 5, and 4.7% for the SWA-PDMS(P-125)/glass with the diameters of 50, 60, and 100 nm, respectively). Therefore, from all the above theoretical and experimental simulations, we determined that the SWA-PDMS with the diameter and period of 80 nm and 125 nm, respectively, can be efficiently utilized as an AR layer to improve the PCE of OSCs.
In order to verify the efficiency of the AR layers for improving the light absorption capability and the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, we fabricated AR layer-embedded solar cell devices by attaching the SWA-PDMS layers onto the glass surface of the devices (see Fig. S5; ESI). The details of the device fabrication and characterization are given in the Experimental section. The OSCs were fabricated in an inverted architecture with PTB7-Th and PC71BM as the electron donor and acceptor materials, respectively (Fig. S6; ESI). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics in Fig. 4a reveal that the bare device without any AR layer exhibited a PCE of 8.67% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.807 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.54 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 71.72. We then examined the effect of AR layers on the device performance. The same device with SWA-PDMS/glass with the diameters of 50, 60, 80, and 100 nm exhibited significantly improved PCEs of 9.94, 10.41, 10.59, and 10.22%, respectively. This result indicates that the improved performance of the devices with SWA-PDMS layers originates from the increased JSC values while the VOC and FF values are almost the same regardless of the SWA-PDMS (Fig. 4c and Table 1). We also measured the photovoltaic characteristics of the device with flat PDMS for comparison. Interestingly, the flat-PDMS OSC also showed a slightly enhanced JSC (∼7%) and thus an improved PCE compared to the bare OSC. This may be attributed to the reduced light reflectance or scattering by the flat PDMS layer. The IPCE spectra of the corresponding devices are displayed in Fig. 4b. The OSCs with the SWA-PDMS layers showed a certain degree of improved conversion efficiency in the wavelength region of 400–700 nm, which is consistent with the improved optical transparency of AR layers (see Fig. 3). By considering that the IPCE is a product of light harvesting efficiency, charge separation efficiency, and charge collection efficiency, we thus attributed the improved device performance using the SWA-PDMS to the enhanced light harvesting by the AR layers.

Fig. 4d and e shows the J–V curves of the OSCs without or with the SWA-PDMS (or flat PDMS) with respect to the tilted angle of the device. It is shown that the decrease of the JSC values of the device with SWA-PDMS was much smaller than that of the bare device or the flat-PDMS-embedded device, as the tilted angle increased. This is due to the enhanced light absorption in the active layer of the device due to the increased effective optical path lengths caused by the AR layer. Consequently, the well-aligned SWAs with omnidirectional properties effectively suppress the surface reflection for obliquely incident light, and thus the AR layer can effectively generate electricity under the circumstance of varying the incident angle of light, which is more beneficial for solar cells to harvest the light throughout the day regardless of any seasons.
As mentioned above, the SWA-PDMS is very effective to enhance light transmittance for improved photocurrent generation of OSCs. Thus, it is interesting that the utilization of the AR layer enabled high transparency for demonstrating transparent solar cells in power-generating window applications. Although semitransparent solar cells combining high PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT) have been investigated earlier, controlled light transparency with enhanced device performance still needs to meet requirements for practical applications. In this regard, an AR layer that not only can increase the transparency of the devices but also leads to a high PCE is quite attractive. The J–V curves and EQE spectra of the semitransparent OSCs with bare glass, flat-PDMS/glass, and SWA-PDMS (D-80)/glass are shown in Fig. 5a and b. The photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding OSCs are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PCE of the semitransparent devices was effectively improved from 7.08 to 8.52% when the SWA-PDMS was employed. In other words, the PCE of the semitransparent OSCs integrated with the SWA-PDMS was predominantly enhanced by ∼20.3% when compared with the bare device (Fig. 5c). Especially, the JSC value was increased from 12.15 mA cm−2 for the bare device to 14.59 mA cm−2 for the device with the SWA-PDMS AR layer. The device with the flat-PDMS results in a certain degree of improvement of JSC. More importantly, the AVT of the semitransparent device was increased from 23.0 to 26.2% as the AR layer was attached (Fig. 5d), indicating that the SWA-PDMS layer is effective for practical applications including window or BIPV. The AVT of 25% is the benchmark for BIPV application, which can be achieved by simple attachment of the SWA-PDMS layer. This work represents a notable advancement of SWA-PDMS as an AR layer in the field of semitransparent OSCs by considering that previous reports of semitransparent OSCs with efficiencies higher than 7% have had significantly lower AVT values than this work. The PCE of 8.52% with an AVT of 26.2% is the best value for fullerene-based semitransparent OSCs, reported so far.

The semitransparent OSCs studied in this work exhibited a greenish blue color appearance due to the intense light absorption below 800 nm of the photoactive materials (see the absorption spectra in Fig. S7 of the ESI). The human perception of color and transparency of the semitransparent solar cells is very important because the eye's recognition is highly dependent on the spectral response of the objectives. In order to evaluate the perception of the semitransparent OSCs with and without SWA-PDMS, the tristimulus values (X, Y, Z) and the color coordinates (x, y) were calculated from the transmittance spectra using the following formulae:

here,
S(λ) is the standard D65 illuminant spectrum, , ȳ, and  are the color matching functions as defined by the CIE protocol, and T(λ) is the transmittance spectrum of the semitransparent OSC devices. The tristimulus (X, Y, Z) values represent the cell colors according to human eye's perception through an objective description of color sensations registered in the eye. The (x, y) values are the color coordinates in the CIE1931 standard color space. Because the human eye's perception changes the color of the light coming through an object when it transmits though semitransparent OSCs, the color coordinates determine the impression of the device to be used in practical window applications. The corresponding color coordinates on the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram are illustrated in Fig. 5e. The color coordinates of the semitransparent OSCs with and without the SWA-PDMS layer are (0.270, 0.320) and (0.254, 0.311), respectively. Although the devices exhibit a light blue color perception of the semitransparent OSCs, the SWA-PDMS changes the coordinates to be close to the achromatic (so-called ‘white point’) on the CIE chromaticity diagram. The close proximity indicates a neutral color sensation when looking through the devices under AM1.5G illumination. Hence, SWA-PDMS helps the semitransparent OSCs to exhibit high quality light transmission with near-white sensation to the human eye without altering the original color of an object. The color rendering index (CRI) is another factor that provides an objective analysis of the color rendering properties of semitransparent OSCs. CRI which is a value expressed in percentage denotes the ability to accurately present an object, as compared to the standard illuminant. According to the CIE 13.3 1995 protocol, the CRI for the semitransparent OSCs increased from 84 to 90% as SWA-PDMS was attached to the front of the device. In consideration of the fact that CRI is dependent on the interaction between the light and the transparent object, we can conclude that SWA-PDMS is effective to reduce the bluish tinge of the semitransparent OSCs.

The encapsulation of the top surface of the solar cells with a self-cleaning protective layer along with AR characteristics is more beneficial to use these devices in a real outdoor environment, since the dust particles and contaminants available in an outdoor environment can easily stick to the surface of solar cells. Furthermore, these contaminants may interrupt the incident light and reduce the light absorption in the active layer of solar cells, thus resulting in a degradation of device performance. So, we further analyzed the surface wetting behavior of the flat-PDMS and SWA-PDMS (D-80) layers. The inset of Fig. 5f shows the photographs of a water droplet on the surface of the SWA-PDMS (D-80) layer before and after the FOTS surface modification treatment including the flat-PDMS without the FOTS surface modification treatment. The PDMS with a flat surface shows hydrophobic properties with contact angle (θCA) values larger than 90°, exhibiting a θCA of ∼99.1 ± 0.5°. However, upon the introduction of the SWAs (D-80) on the PDMS surface, the hydrophobicity was further enhanced to a θCA value of ∼118.9 ± 0.8°. This is mainly observed due to the enhanced surface roughness, which can be explained by the Cassie–Baxter theory. In addition, to further improve the hydrophobicity of the surface of the SWA-PDMS (D-80) sample, a FOTS surface modification treatment was performed. Consequently, the SWA-PDMS (D-80) after the FOTS treatment exhibited a further increased θCA value of ∼135.1 ± 0.5°. Therefore, this hydrophobic surface with a relatively high θCA value can contribute to the self-cleaning function, which can be utilized to remove surface contaminants like dust particles by rolling down water droplets (i.e., rain). Resultantly, the proposed AR layer with self-cleaning ability would maintain the optical performance of solar cells in outdoor for a long time. For further confirmation, we investigated the stability of the OSCs under an ambient (or external) environment with or without the SWA-PDMS (D-80) layer. While installing the devices under the ambient environment, we sprinkle water with an interval of 4–5 h to investigate the self-cleaning function of the above AR layers. As shown in Fig. 5f, the devices retained 86, 85.8, and 87.3% of the initial PCEs for the bare device, flat-PDMS, and SWA-PDMS (D-80), respectively, after storage under ambient environment conditions for 216 h. From the above results, we can conclude that the SWA-PDMS (D-80) layer is beneficial to improve the ambient stability of the OSCs. This is mainly attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the SWA-PDMS (D-80) layer, which could be used to wash out the surface contaminants by rolling down the water droplets. Consequently, the proposed FOTS treated SWA-PDMS (D-80) layer with self-cleaning ability may be used to retain the performance of solar cells in an outdoor (or ambient) environment for a long time.

In summary, the SWAs on PDMS layer were developed using a simple and cost-effective SIL technique via AAO molds. The SWA-PDMS was further employed as an AR layer to enhance the PCE as well as the transparency of OSCs. The SWA-PDMS/glass with a diameter and period of 80 and 125 nm, respectively, was optimized and it exhibited a much higher TSW of ∼95.4% and much lower RSW of ∼4.2% compared to the bare glass (TSW ∼91.9% and RSW ∼8.06%). Utilizing the optimal SWA-PDMS as an AR layer on a glass substrate of opaque and semitransparent OSCs led to the PCE values of 10.59 and 8.52%, respectively, corresponding to the enhancement of 22.14 and 20.33%, respectively, compared to the reference devices (i.e., PCEs of 8.67 and 7.08% for the opaque and semitransparent OSCs with bare glass). In particular, the OSC with the SWA-PDMS (D-80)/glass also showed less angle-dependent photovoltaic characteristics at 10–70° compared to the reference and flat-PDMS-embedded devices. Additionally, it was also utilized to enhance the overall transmittance of semitransparent OSC devices, indicating a relatively high AVT value of 26.2% with improved color coordinates, compared to the reference device. Therefore, the results clearly suggest that the SWA-PDMS with high transmittance over the wide-angle and broad wavelength ranges could be useful in not only high-performance OSCs but also semitransparent devices with optimal transmittance and color coordinates.


AAO (TopMembranes Tech.) template, trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (FOTS; Aldrich), trimethylsiloxy-terminated vinylmethylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane (VDT-731; Gelest, Inc.), methylhydrosiloxane-dimethylsiloxane (HMS-301; Gelest, Inc.), Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning Co.), PTB7-Th (1-Material Co.), and PC71BM (Nano-C) were used as received.


The SWA-PDMS layers were fabricated from AAO molds via the SIL technique. Initially, the surface wetting behavior of the as-purchased AAO molds (with the period of 100–450 nm and diameter of 50–100 nm) were modified by trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane gas phase silanization for a few hours. Because the AAO with a hydrophobic surface wetting behavior can prevent the PDMS from sticking to the AAO mold. Afterward, to develop the SWAs on PDMS layer, a hard PDMS (h-PDMS; a mixture of VDT-731, and HMS-301 copolymers) solution was spin-coated onto the AAO mold and then cured at 80 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, a soft PDMS solution (s-PDMS; a mixture of the curing agent and base resin with a weight ratio of 1:10) was poured onto the h-PDMS/AAO mold followed by the curing treatment at 80 °C for 2 h. Finally, the PDMS (h-PDMS/s-PDMS) layer was carefully peeled off from the AAO mold, yielding an SWA-PDMS layer with a thickness of ∼150 μm. In addition, to enhance the hydrophobicity, the surface wetting behavior of the SWA-PDMS layer was further modified by dipping it into a mixture of FOTS and hexane solutions with a volumetric ratio of 1:103 for 30 s and dried in an oven at 30 °C for 12 h.


The surface morphologies of the as-fabricated SWA-PDMS layers were analyzed by using an FE-SEM (LEO SUPRA 55, Carl Zeiss). Furthermore, their optical characteristics were studied by utilizing a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian). The surface wetting behavior of PDMS layers was investigated by employing a contact angle measurement system (Phoenix-300, SEO Co., Ltd.).


For theoretical optical analysis of the SWA-PDMS layers, the RCWA calculations were performed using commercial software (DiffractMOD, Rsoft Design Group). To design the theoretical model, the SWAs on PDMS layers were assumed to be a cylindrical pattern array and represented by a periodic hexagonal geometry in the Cartesian coordinate system of a scalar-valued function of three variables, f(x, y, z), for simplicity. Moreover, to analyze the effect of the period of SWAs on the optical transmittance of SWA-PDMS, their diameter and height were fixed at 100 nm and 150 nm, respectively. Besides, the effect of diameter of SWAs on the optical transmittance of SWA-PDMS was investigated at the period and height of 125 nm and 150 nm, respectively. The refractive indices of the glass and PDMS used in both the optical analyses were set to be 1.52 and 1.43, respectively. The thicknesses of PDMS and glass were fixed to 150 and 300 μm, respectively.


Organic solar cell devices studied in this work were fabricated with an inverted architecture: ITO/zinc oxide (ZnO)/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag). The indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glasses (10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent water, followed by acetone and isopropanol. After drying with a nitrogen flow, the substrates were treated with ultraviolet–ozone for 15 min. Then, a thin ZnO film was formed by spin-coating a precursor solution (zinc acetate dihydrate in 2-methoxyethanol) followed by thermal annealing at 200 °C for 1 h. After the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere, the photoactive blend solution (1.5 wt%) of PTB7-Th and PC71BM (1:1.5 in weight ratio) in o-dichlorobenzene with 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 120 s. To complete the device fabrication, MoO3 and Ag were subsequently evaporated to 8 and 100 nm thicknesses, respectively. For semitransparent solar cells, thin Ag (∼10 nm) was evaporated to complete the devices. Active areas (0.1 cm2) of the devices were defined using a shadow mask. The photovoltaic performance was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere inside a glovebox. The J–V curves were obtained from a 4200-SCS (Keithley) under air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) (100 mW cm−2) illumination, which was calibrated using an NREL-certified photodiode. The incident photon-to-current density efficiency was measured using a lock-in amplifier system which records the short-circuit current density under the chopped monochromatic light. The AVT value of semitransparent solar cells was calculated in the visible region (370–740 nm).
