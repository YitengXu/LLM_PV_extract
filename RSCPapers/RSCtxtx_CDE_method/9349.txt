For n–i–p type perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs), one of the limitations which hinder the improvement of device performance is the extremely low electrical conductivity of the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL). Herein, two novel functionalized water-soluble fullerene derivatives C60O∼18(OH)∼10(NH2)∼8 (f-C60) and C70O∼18(OH)∼10(NH2)∼10 (f-C70) were prepared and utilized as buffer layers between ITO and a vacuum-deposited fullerene C60 ETL in Pero-SCs. After inserting f-C60 and f-C70 layers, the Pero-SCs showed an enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film, more efficient charge transport, reduced recombination and a decreased charge-transport resistance. Therefore, a summit power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.97% was achieved for the device with the f-C60/C60 ETL, which was ∼24% higher than that of the control device (13.71%). The PCE of the Pero-SC based on the f-C70/C60 ETL also exhibited a 16% enhancement. This work demonstrated the great potential of f-C60 and f-C70 for application as ETLs in Pero-SCs.

Perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) have attracted intense attention worldwide recently, due to their low-cost processing and high solar conversion efficiency as well as the unique photoelectric properties of perovskite absorbers. In 2009, Miyasaka and co-workers employed perovskite materials in solar cells for the first time. Since then, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of Pero-SCs have witnessed an unprecedentedly rapid increase, skyrocketing from 3.8% to 22.1% in only a few years. Such a high PCE of Pero-SCs, which could be comparable to those of commercial silicon based solar cells, makes Pero-SCs promising devices for commercial application in the field of photovoltaic technology.

Highly efficient Pero-SCs require a high quality perovskite absorber film with full coverage surface morphology, fewer defects, larger grain size and high crystallinity, as well as excellent electron transport materials (ETMs) and hole transport materials (HTMs). Thus, many efforts have been dedicated to improve the abovementioned aspects of devices. Among them, the electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in enhancing the PCE of Pero-SCs. For n–i–p type Pero-SCs, TiO2 was the most commonly used ETL material. However, many disadvantages of TiO2, such as its low electrical conductivity, the necessity of a high temperature (∼500 °C) sintering step and severe hysteresis in Pero-SCs, have severely limited its application in Pero-SCs in pursuing a device with excellent performance. Therefore, to increase electron mobility and obtain high PCE, new ETMs such as graphene quantum dots, graphene, SnO2, and ZnO have been employed to modify or substitute TiO2.
Fullerenes and their derivatives, with excellent electron transport properties and the ability to suppress hysteresis and improve device stability, have shown great potential for application in Pero-SCs as ETLs. For instance, Zhao et al. reported that, with the application of C60 as an electron-selective layer on top of ITO by a vacuum-deposition method, the device demonstrated a very small hysteresis and reached a high PCE of 15.7%. A recent study also presents that a fullerene derivative fulleropyrrolidine with a triethylene glycol monoethyl ether side chain (PTEG-1) ETL could passivate electron traps and suppress trap-assisted recombination in Pero-SCs. As a result, compared to the PCBM ETL based device, a PCE increase of ∼34% was achieved. In another recent report, the TiO2 ETL was modified with a C70 interlayer prepared by a solution process. After modification, a perovskite film with a smoother surface was achieved along with the resulting increased electron extraction of Pero-SCs. In our previous report, we also introduced fullerenol (an easily accessible water-soluble fullerene derivative) modified TiO2 as an ETL. The PCE of the corresponding device was enhanced by ∼17.5% compared to the control device. These results suggest that fullerenes and their derivatives have great potential for application as ETLs in Pero-SCs.
In this study, we synthesized two novel water-soluble fullerene derivatives based on C60 and C70. The two fullerene derivatives were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the average molecular formulae of these functionalized C60 and C70 were determined to be C60O∼18(OH)∼10(NH2)∼8 (f-C60) and C70O∼18(OH)∼10(NH2)∼10 (f-C70), respectively. And for the first time, f-C60 and f-C70 were applied as buffer layers between the ITO electrode and the C60 ETL. The systematic and comparative studies and characterizations demonstrated that, with the introduction of f-C60 and f-C70 layers, the corresponding devices present a more efficient charge carrier transport, decreased interfacial resistance and enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film. As a result, the champion PCE of Pero-SCs with the f-C60/C60 ETL reached 16.97%. The device with the f-C70/C60 ETL achieved a lower but still improved PCE of 15.94%.

The f-C60 and f-C70 were synthesized by a one-step reaction following the previously reported strategy used for gadolinium metallic fullerene derivatives; the detailed synthetic process is presented in Scheme S1 (see ESI). XPS measurements were performed to evaluate the chemical structure of f-C60 and f-C70 (Fig. 1). The XPS survey spectra of f-C60 and f-C70 are shown in Fig. 1a and d, in which three peaks (286 eV, 401 eV and 533 eV) are assigned to C1s, N1s and O1s, respectively. In Fig. 1b and e, the peaks centered at 285 eV, 287 eV and 289 eV correspond to the C–C (CC), C–O (C–N), and CO, respectively. The N1s peaks located at the binding energy values of 400 eV and 402 eV could be attributed to –NH2 (the free amino group) and –NH3+ (the partially protonated amino group). Based on the above assignments, the area integrals and the atomic ratios of C, N and O elements, the average molecular formula of f-C60 and f-C70 could be estimated as C60O∼18(OH)∼10(NH2)∼8 and C70O∼18(OH)∼10(NH2)∼10 (for details refer to Tables S1–S4). To verify these estimated molecular formulas, elemental analysis data were also obtained. As for f-C60, the calculated values are C 55.14%, H 2.01%, O 34.28% and N 8.57%, and the elemental analysis results are C 54.12%, H 2.48%, and N 8.34%. And for f-C70, the calculated values are C 57.62%, H 2.07%, O 30.70% and N 9.60% and the elemental analysis results are C 56.33%, H 2.56% and N 9.21%. The experimental data from the elemental analysis were consistent with the calculated values from the average molecular formula based on XPS data.

Moreover, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of f-C60 and f-C70 are shown in Fig. S1, along with the broad ν O–H and ν N–H bands located at around 3425 cm−1 and 3156 cm−1. The strong peak at 1614 cm−1 was assigned to ν CO, and the peaks at 1396 cm−1 and 1098 cm−1 could be ascribed to δs C–O–H and ν C–O, respectively. These FT-IR features agree well with the XPS data, which confirms that carbonyl, amino and hydroxyl groups have been successfully attached to the carbon cage. And the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of f-C60 and f-C70 are displayed in Fig. S2 in the ESI. The TGA data showed that active elimination of –OH, –NH2 and O groups takes place when heating from 172 °C to 510 °C, and the decomposition of the fullerene cage occurs at above 510 °C.
The pristine C60 and C70 solutions in toluene solvent are purple and reddish brown in color, respectively. However, both the f-C60 and f-C70 in water present a similar yellow color (Fig. S3). The UV-vis absorption spectra of C60 and C70 in toluene and f-C60 and f-C70 in water are shown in Fig. S4. Compared with C60 and C70, f-C60 and f-C70 exhibit almost featureless absorption, which could be ascribed to the loss of π conjugation after functionalization.
To investigate the effect of f-C60 and f-C70 on the performance of Pero-SCs, the devices were fabricated with and without f-C60 or f-C70 under the same conditions. The n–i–p type Pero-SC with the device configuration of ITO/f-C60 or f-C70/C60/perovskite/P3HT/MoO3/Ag is presented in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b and c show the molecular structure diagrams of f-C60 and f-C70 and the energy levels of the materials of the device, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding devices are listed in Table 1. It shows that the device with pristine C60 presents an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.87 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 69.38% with a corresponding PCE of 13.71%. After inserting f-C60 and f-C70 interlayers, the PCE showed a significant improvement and a champion PCE of 16.97% with a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 21.32 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.25% is achieved for the Pero-SCs based on the f-C60/C60 ETL (the concentration of f-C60 is 0.5 mg mL−1). Meanwhile, the device with f-C70/C60 as the ETL also achieved an improved PCE of 15.94%, with a Voc, Jsc and FF of 1.03 V, 21.21 mA cm−2 and 72.58%, respectively.

ITO/f-C60 or f-C70/perovskite/P3HT/MoO3/Ag devices were also fabricated and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table S5. It shows that the device without the ETL presents a PCE of 4.15%, while the Pero-SCs based on f-C60 or f-C70 demonstrated a PCE of 7.78% and 7.14%, respectively. These much lower performances may be due to the fact that the very thin layer of f-C60/f-C70 (ca. 1.0–3.0 nm) alone could not transport electrons efficiently, highlighting the importance of both the f-C60/f-C70 and C60 layers in these enhanced device structures.
Compared with the device based on the pristine C60 ETL, the PCE of the Pero-SCs with the f-C60 interlayer was significantly enhanced by ∼24%, and the device with the f-C70 layer demonstrated an ∼16% higher PCE than the control device. Table 1 also shows that the enhanced device performance was due to the improvement of all three parameters, Voc, Jsc and FF. The Pero-SCs with f-C60 showed a higher PCE with a relatively higher FF than the f-C70-based device. It is probably owing to the better symmetry of the C60 cage, and the multiple functional groups distributed evenly in the C60 cage, which showed a better electron conductivity than f-C70; these results would be further verified by the following current–voltage (I–V) measurements.
The work functions (WFs) of f-C60 and f-C70 modified ITO were measured as 4.45 eV and 4.42 eV respectively, which lie in between those of the ITO (4.75 eV) and C60 (3.90 eV). For the conventional n–i–p type Pero-SCs, to some extent, the suitable energy level offset between ITO and the ETL is beneficial for the improvement of Voc. Thus, the suitable work functions of f-C60 and f-C70 could reduce the energy level gap between ITO and the C60 ETL and decrease the energy loss of electrons transporting from the perovskite active layer to the ITO electrode, which may contribute to the enhanced Voc of the corresponding devices.

Fig. 3a and b depict the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices with and without the f-C60 or f-C70 (the concentration is 0.5 mg mL−1) interlayer. The J–V characteristics of Pero-SCs based on f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 ETLs with other concentrations are presented in Fig. S5.Fig. 3b demonstrates that the integrated photocurrents were 19.34 mA cm−2, 20.74 mA cm−2 and 20.68 mA cm−2 for the devices with pristine C60, f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 ETLs, respectively. These integrated photocurrents were in good agreement with the corresponding Jsc of devices, and the maximum IPCE of the devices with f-C60 and f-C70 layers reached ∼93% and ∼89%, respectively. These results show that, after inserting the f-C60 or f-C70 interlayer, the more efficient charge collection and reduced recombination contributed to enhanced IPCE and Jsc, which brought about an improvement of device performance.
To further understand the effect of the f-C60 or f-C70 thin layer on the enhancement of device performance, dark J–V characteristics plotted on a semilog scale were measured, as shown in Fig. 3c. The device with f-C60 or f-C70 exhibits much smaller leakage current compared to the pristine C60 device at negative voltages. This result indicated an enhancement of charge transport and a reduced series resistance, which in turn lead to an improved Jsc and FF.Fig. 3d–f present the steady-state photocurrents and efficiencies without and with the f-C60 or f-C70 interlayer, respectively; by applying constant bias voltages of 0.76 V, 0.86 V and 0.82 V, stabilized efficiencies of 13.54%, and 16.80% as well as 15.75% were obtained, respectively. These results were consistent with the device performances as indicated by the J–V curves. Moreover, Fig. 3d–f also showed that the photocurrent of the device with f-C70/C60 stabilized much faster than those with C60 and f-C60/C60. As previous reports suggested that the interface ion migration may influence the J–V hysteresis behavior and nonsteady-state photocurrent, to understand the J–V hysteresis behavior and ion migration of the devices with f-C60 and f-C70 layers, the J–V characteristics with forward and reverse scans of the Pero-SCs based on C60, f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 ETLs were measured and are displayed in Fig. S6 and Table S6. The device with the f-C70/C60 ETL demonstrates a smaller J–V hysteresis compared to the Pero-SCs based on C60 and f-C60/C60 ETLs. This result agrees well with that of the steady-state photocurrent. This suggested that the faster photocurrent stabilization of the device with f-C70/C60 than that with C60 or f-C60/C60 might be ascribed to the fact that, after inserting the f-C70 layer, the interface ion migration decreased and compared to f-C60, f-C70 may have the ability to better suppress the interface ion migration.
It is widely acknowledged that a high-quality perovskite film plays a vital role in the improvement of the performance of Pero-SCs. Therefore, to further validate whether the f-C60 or f-C70 layer could influence the surface morphology of perovskite films, the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films deposited on C60, f-C60/C60, and f-C70/C60 were obtained and are illustrated in Fig. S7, and Fig. 4a presents the cross-sectional SEM image of the Pero-SC. It can be observed from Fig. S7 that the insertion of f-C60 or f-C70 did not make a major impact on the surface morphology of the perovskite film, and all the perovskite films grown on pristine C60, f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 layers exhibited full-coverage and continuous perovskite films.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were employed to further investigate the effect of inserting f-C60 and f-C70 on the crystallinity of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 4b, all the perovskite films present the same prominent peaks at 14.08° and 28.45°, which were assigned to the [110] and [220] crystal planes of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite. After the insertion of the f-C60 or f-C70 layer, the intensities of the XRD peaks have been significantly increased, which indicates the enhancement of the crystallization of the perovskite. In particular, the XRD spectra of the perovskite film on top of f-C60/C60 showed the highest intensity, about two times higher than that of the perovskite film atop the pristine C60 layer, which suggests that this perovskite film has the highest crystallinity among those in the modified devices. This enhanced crystallization could suppress charge recombination and facilitate charge transport, which are beneficial for the improvement of Jsc and FF.
To understand the effect of insertion of f-C60/f-C70 on the growth of the perovskite film, the surface morphologies of the ITO/C60, ITO/f-C60/C60 and ITO/f-C70/C60 were further studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The resulting AFM images showed that the surface fluctuation of the ITO/f-C60/C60 and ITO/f-C70/C60 layer was smaller than that of the ITO/C60 layer (Fig. S8). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the ITO/C60 layer was 2.41 nm, while the RMS values of the ITO/f-C60/C60 and ITO/f-C70/C60 layer were 2.08 nm and 2.17 nm, respectively. Therefore, after the insertion of f-C60/f-C70 under the C60 layer, the roughness of the C60 ETL was decreased and the surface became much smoother, which likely lead to the enhanced crystallinity of the corresponding perovskite films.
To further explore the effect of charge transport properties after introducing f-C60 and f-C70 on the device performance, the current–voltage (I–V) measurements of sandwiched structured ITO/C60/Au, ITO/f-C60/C60/Au and ITO/f-C70/C60/Au devices were conducted, as displayed in Fig. 5. The slope of the I–V curves based on the equation I = σ0Ad−1V was used to determine the direct current (DC) conductivities (σ0) of pristine C60, f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60. In the I = σ0Ad−1V equation, A represents the detected area and d is assigned to the thickness of the films. Based on this equation, the conductivities of f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 were calculated as 2.46 × 10−3 mS cm−1 and 1.81 × 10−3 mS cm−1, respectively. In comparison, the conductivity of the pristine C60 only was measured as 7.32 × 10−4 mS cm−1. This suggests that, after introducing f-C60 and f-C70 thin films under the C60 ETL, the conductivities of the corresponding devices become 3.4 times and 2.5 times higher than that of the device based on the pristine C60. These results suggest that the electrons generated from the perovskite active layer could be collected and transported more efficiently by f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60, which contributed to the higher Jsc and FF of the Pero-SCs. It is noteworthy that f-C60 demonstrated much better conductivity than f-C70. It might be attributed to the more even distribution of the functional groups in the highly symmetric C60 cage rather than the less symmetric C70 cage. In addition, f-C70 possessed two more functional groups bonded onto the C70 cage, which possibly increased the steric hindrance and resulted in lower electron conductivity compared to f-C60.
To further investigate the impact of the f-C60 or f-C70 interlayer on the electrical properties and charge-transport resistance of the devices, alternating current impedance spectrometry (ACIS) measurements were performed. Pero-SCs were prepared without and with the f-C60 or f-C70 layer and the corresponding Voc values were measured under dark conditions. Fig. 6a presents the Nyquist plots of the devices. The equivalent circuit used to fit the Nyquist plots is illustrated in Fig. 6b, in which the series resistance (Rs) corresponds to the sheet resistance of two electrodes, and the charge-transport resistance (RCT) is assigned to the resistance between electrodes and the transport layer as well as the transport layer and perovskite active layer; the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2.

As observed in Table 2, the Rss of the devices based on C60, f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 ETLs showed no remarkable difference, which can be ascribed to the similar device configurations and the same measurement conditions. Nevertheless, the Pero-SCs with f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 ETLs displayed a much smaller RCT of 18.29 Ω and 42.93 Ω compared to that of the device with the C60 ETL (73.05 Ω). The significantly decreased RCT indicated that charge transported more easily from the perovskite film to interlayers with the insertion of f-C60 and f-C70. These results suggest that f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60 presented a superior charge extraction ability than pristine C60, which provided a rational explanation for the higher Jsc and FF.
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements have become a widely used characterization method for the study of the charge transportation and recombination in the perovskite film and transport layers. Thus, in this study, to further investigate the charge dynamics, both steady-state PL and transient PL measurements were conducted. Fig. 7a presents the steady-state PL of C60/perovskite, f-C60/C60/perovskite and f-C70/C60/perovskite. It shows that the emissive band peak of the perovskite film is located at 770 nm, and a clear fluorescence quenching was obtained after the insertion of the f-C60 or f-C70 layer. This PL quenching suggests that with f-C60 or f-C70 the thin layer could accelerate the charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the ETL, which provides a good explanation for the enhanced Jsc and FF of the devices based on f-C60 and f-C70 ETLs. In addition, the perovskite film on top of the f-C60/C60 ETL demonstrated a very remarkable quenching compared to the other two ETLs. This may be due to the higher conductivity of f-C60 as indicated in I–V measurements.
Transient PL characterization was employed to probe the influence of the f-C60 or f-C70 layer on the dissociation and recombination of the charge carriers. Fig. 7b displays the PL spectra of perovskite films coated on the pristine C60, f-C60/C60 and f-C70/C60. The biexponential decay function was used to fit the PL decay curves, composed of a fast decay and a slow decay process. The detailed fitted data of lifetimes and weight fractions are listed in Table 3. The fast decay process could be assigned to the quenching of free charges that were generated from the perovskite active layer and then transport to the P3HT HTL and ETL, and the slow decay component represented radiative recombination of free charges. As shown in Table 2, the fast decay weight fractions of the Pero-SCs with C60, f-C60/C60, and f-C70/C60 were 33.64%, 47.46%, and 40.59%, respectively. These fractions increased with the insertion of the f-C60 or f-C70 thin layer which suggests that the charge carrier transported more efficiently with the insertion of both thin layers. In particular, the f-C60 exhibited better charge transportation properties than f-C70, in accordance with the results of the I–V studies. The devices with f-C60 and f-C70 demonstrated a decreased slow decay τ2 of 11.10 ns and 16.23 ns compared to those of the pristine C60 (25.75 ns). For the slow decay process, the smaller lifetime and weight fraction indicated charge transport from the perovskite layer to the electrodes rather than the occurred radiative recombination. Thus, the transient PL measurements confirmed that f-C60 and f-C70 could facilitate the charge transport of devices, which supplied further evidence for the increased Jsc.

In summary, two novel functionalized water-soluble fullerene derivatives f-C60 and f-C70 were prepared via a simple one-step process and were utilized as ETLs in Pero-SCs for the first time. Through introducing the f-C60 and f-C70 layer between the ITO electrode and the C60 layer, the Voc of the devices was increased. This could be ascribed to the suitable work functions of f-C60 and f-C70, which reduced the energy band gap between the C60 ETL and ITO. The dark J–V measurements show that, after the insertion of the f-C60 and f-C70 layer, a lower leakage current for both types of devices was obtained, which was beneficial for higher Voc and Jsc. XRD patterns show that the crystallinity of the perovskite film was enhanced after inserting the f-C60 and f-C70 layer. Additionally, the efficient electron extraction (confirmed by PL studies) and the reduced charge-transport resistance (showed by ACIS characterization) synergistically improved the Jsc and FF of the corresponding devices after the insertion of the f-C60 and f-C70 layer. As a consequence, compared with the bare C60 ETL device, the Pero-SCs with f-C60/C60 showed a PCE increase from 13.71% to 16.97% and the device based on the f-C70/C60 ETL yielded a PCE of 15.94%. The better performance of devices based on f-C60/C60 than those based on f-C70/C60 could be ascribed to the better electron mobility of f-C60 than f-C70, due to the more even distribution of the functional groups in the highly symmetric C60 cage. These results suggested that water-soluble fullerene derivatives, possessing excellent charge mobility, are promising interfacial materials for Pero-SCs.


C60 (99.9%) and C70 (99%) were purchased from Puyang Yongxin Fullerene Technology Co., Ltd. and used without further purification. H2O2 (30 wt%) and NH4OH (25–28 wt%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Ethanol was purchased from Chinasun Specialty Products Co., Ltd.

Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized following the procedures in the literature. Methylammonium chloride (MACl) and PbI2 (99.999%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp and Alfa Aesar, respectively.

All the perovskite solar cells were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates (10 Ω sq−1, CSG Holding Co., Ltd.). The ITO substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using detergent, water, deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol for 20 min each. To obtain a hydrophilic surface, the ITO slides were treated with UVO for 20 min after being dried in a nitrogen flow. The fullerene derivatives f-C60 and f-C70 were dissolved in ultrapure water with different concentrations, and the f-C60 and f-C70 solutions were spin-coated on top of the ITO substrate at 1500 rpm for 60 s. After being annealed at 120 °C for 25 min, the slides were transferred to obtain the C60 layer by vacuum evaporation. The thickness of the C60 layer was controlled to 12 nm.

The perovskite film was deposited by a new solvent-assisted molecule inserting strategy (S-AMI) method. PbI2 was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, J&K) with a concentration of 461 mg mL−1, and MAI and MACl were dissolved in isopropanol (IPA, J&K) with a mass ratio of 10:1 (MAI, 50 mg mL−1). All the perovskite precursor solutions were stirred at 70 °C overnight and filtered using a 0.22 μm PTFE filter before use. The PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 4500 rpm for 20 s and then the MAI and MACl solution was dropped onto the center of the wet spin-coating PbI2 film for 25 s. After putting the samples on a hot plate, the film color turned dark brown immediately, and the perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C for 7 min.
For the hole transport material (HTM), 30 mg P3HT was dissolved in 1 mL ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), 20.4 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 28.3 mg mL−1, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile and 10.2 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed into a P3HT solution. The P3HT layer was prepared by spin-coating onto the perovskite layer at 1200 rpm for 60 s. Finally, 7 nm of MoO3 and 100 nm of Ag were deposited under vacuum evaporation. An active area of 0.0757 cm2 of the device has been defined by using a shadow mask. The direct current conductivity was measured with a device configuration of ITO/f-C60 or f-C70/C60/Au. The Au electrode with 80 nm was evaporated under high vacuum (∼10−4 Pa).

XPS was performed using an ESCALAB 250Xi (USA). The UV-vis absorption spectra of C60, C70, and f-C60 as well as f-C70 were collected on an Agilent Cary 5000 (USA). Elemental analysis was performed using an Elementar Vario EL-III instrument. FTIR and WF measurements of f-C60 and f-C70 were conducted on a VERTEX 70V (Bruker, Germany) and using peak force Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), respectively. TGA was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 6, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. The J–V curves and steady-state efficiencies of Pero-SCs were acquired using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination. A measurement system of QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.) was used to measure the IPCE spectra. The thicknesses of f-C60 and f-C70 were determined using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000V, J.A. Woollam Co., USA). The SEM images were captured using an S-4700 (Japan) to study the surface morphologies. The crystallinity of the perovskite films was measured using XRD performed on a diffractometer (D2 PHASER, Bruker). AFM images were captured on a Multimode 8 microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) in peak force quantitative nanomechanical mode. ACIS measurements were performed on an IM6 electrochemical workstation of Zahner Zennium (Germany), and Z-view software was used to analyze impedance data. An instrument of FLS980 (UK) was used to obtain steady-state PL spectra, and transient PL characterization was performed on a Lifespec II produced by Edinburgh Instrument (UK).
