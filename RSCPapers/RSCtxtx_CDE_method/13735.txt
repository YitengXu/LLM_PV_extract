Transition metal phosphates have aroused wide attention and been applied in the field of energy conversion due to their high catalytic properties and low cost, but magnetic metal phosphates are rarely used in DSSC. In this work, the magnetic CoP@FeP4 thin film was prepared on carbon paper (CP) using a two-step process and proposed as a counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The morphology of CoP@FeP4@CP with a silkworm-like structure is advantageous to enhance the catalytic ability for the interface reaction, establish a good connection between the electrode material and electrolyte, and accelerate the electron transmission. The characterizations using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel curves all indicate that the CoP@FeP4@CP CE shows excellent electrochemical catalytic performance for the I−/I3− electrolyte. Under optimal conditions, a high power conversion efficiency of 9.88% is achieved for DSSC with CoP@FeP4@CP CE much higher than that of Pt (7.49%) and CoP@CP (8.73%) CEs. This phenomenon can be attributed to the unique chemical structure and the synergistic effect of CoP@FeP4@CP CE. CoP@FeP4@CP CE with the advantages of efficient, low cost, and facile synthesis is a promising alternative to the expensive Pt CE for the DSSCs in the future.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as promising photoelectric converters for converting solar energy into electrical energy, have attracted a lot of researchers due to their low cost, simple preparation, high efficiency, and environmental friendliness. Typically, a DSSC is a sandwich structure cell composed of photoanode, counter electrode (CE), and electrolyte. As one of the most essential components, CE plays an important role in the transfer of electrons from an external circuit to triiodide and iodine in the redox electrolyte. The ideal CE materials should have the characteristics of high conductivity, excellent catalytic activity, high chemical stability, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Pt with extraordinary electrocatalytic activity and conductivity is the state-of-the-art CE catalyst in DSSCs, but its rare properties limit the wide development of DSSCs. Therefore, it is urgent to develop non-Pt ideal CE materials. Significant efforts have been devoted to exploring Pt-free CE, such as carbon materials, transition metal compounds, alloys, conductive polymers, and their hybrids, for accelerating the large-scale application of DSSCs.

Transition metal phosphates have the same catalytic mechanism as hydrogenases and are widely used in energy storage. Recently, many reports declared that Fe introduction could further enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of multi-metallic electrocatalysts, yet Fe could only serve as a OER promotor. Some latest theoretical and experimental studies also proposed that Fe is likely to be an active site in some Fe-based electrocatalysts. Also, according to theoretical calculations and experimental confirmation, the combination of multiple nanomaterials can deliver better catalytic performance than a single material due to the synergistic effect. For example, Wang et al. successfully synthesized a CoP3/Ni2P heterostructure, for which the catalytic activity is higher than pure CoP3 and pure Ni2P. In recent years, transition metal phosphates have been increasingly being applied in DSSC CEs. Wu et al. reported that Ni5P4/C as the CEs material of DSSCs generated excellent photoelectric conversion performance. In another work, Gao et al. used CoP and carbon paper (CP) as the CE, significantly improving the conversion efficiency of the DSSC. More importantly, hybrid materials composed of two kinds of transition metal phosphates are rarely used as CE in DSSC.
Owing to the above factors, we designed a systematic hydrothermal-phosphorization processing procedure to prepare magnetic transition metal phosphide nanoparticles as CE catalysts for DSSC. It is well known that electrons moving in a magnetic field are subject to Lorentz forces. Therefore, the effect of the Lorentz force may cause the electrons to deviate from part of the recombination center, thus improving the effective collection of electrons. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the CoP@FeP4 precursor was successfully prepared on CP. Then, the magnetic CoP@FeP4@CP CE catalysts were obtained by high-temperature phosphorization treatment. The prepared magnetic CoP@FeP4@CP CE shows excellent electrochemical catalytic activity from a series of electrochemical tests. Under optimum conditions, the DSSC assembled with CoP@FeP4@CP CE achieves a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.88% under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2, which is expected to be a reliable CE material instead of Pt in DSSCs.

The carbon paper (purchased from NSG, Japan, 15 Ω sq−1) was cut into rectangles of 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm and cleaned with distilled water, ethyl alcohol, and acetone for 30 min in sequence. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)2·9H2O), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), and red phosphorus were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Agent Ltd, China. Urea was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Ltd. Commercial Z907 dye was purchased from Solaronix Ltd (Switzerland). All of the above reagents were used without further purification.


The CoP@FeP4@CP precursor was prepared using a hydrothermal process. Firstly, 3.5 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, moderate mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 35 mmol CO(NH2)2, and 10.5 mmol NH4F were diffused in 50 ml ultrapure water under magnetic stirring for 30 min until all the reactants were dissolved. The pre-treated carbon papers were put into 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave before transferring to the above solution. After being sealed, the autoclave was placed in an oven and heated at 180 °C for a reaction time of 8 h. After the autoclaves were naturally cooled down to room temperature, the carbon papers were purified with water and ethanol 5 times and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h in vacuum. Secondly, the dry carbon paper with CoP@FeP4 precursor and 1.5 g of red phosphorus was positioned in a tube furnace to carry out the phosphorization process at 850 °C for 5 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 under a negative pressure environment.

In order to achieve an optimal performance of CE materials, the products with various concentrations of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1.75, 3.5, and 5.25 mmol) were also synthesized by keeping other reactant concentrations unchanged. The corresponding CoP@FeP4@CP products are abbreviated as CP@FP@CP-1, CP@FP@CP-2, and CP@FP@CP-3, respectively.
For comparison, CoP@CP was prepared with the concentrations of 3.5 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 35 mmol CO(NH2)2, and 10.5 mmol NH4F under the same preparation conditions.

Firstly, the TiO2 photoanode was prepared as previously reported. The sintered TiO2 electrode with an exposed area of 0.283 cm2 was treated with 40 mM titanium tetrachloride solution. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was fabricated by soaking the treated TiO2 film in a dye of Z907 (0.3 mM) ethanol solution for 24 h. Secondly, the resultant dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and CoP@FeP4@CP CE were clipped together. By clamping Surlyn between the two electrodes, followed by injecting the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (containing 0.10 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.50 M 4-tert-butyl-pyridine, and 0.60 M tetrabutylammonium iodide in acetonitrile) DSSC with a sandwich structure was conducted.


X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Al Ka radiation source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) was carried out to confirm the elemental compositions of CoP@FeP4@CP CE. The crystalline structures of the composites were investigated by glancing incident X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Pro, PANalytical B.V., Netherlands). The field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7001F, Japan) was used to analyze the surface morphology of the CoP@FeP4@CP film. The morphology and microstructure of the materials were further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to measure the elements contained in the samples. The cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel curves were characterized using an electrochemical measurement system (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) analysis of the DSSCs was carried out under irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 from the solar simulator (CEL-S500, Beijing China Education Au-light Co., Ltd) in ambient atmosphere.


The morphology and structure details of carbon paper, CoP@CP, and CoP@FeP4@CP CEs were recorded using SEM and presented in Fig. S1 and Fig. 2. In Fig. S1, carbon paper is composed of carbon fibers, which is conducive to the attachment of active substances. It can be seen in Fig. 2a that the CoP@CP CE exhibits a disordered and irregular structure with rough surface morphology. Interestingly, the products of CoP@FeP4@CP are spread on the carbon paper like a few silkworms composed of many polyhedral nanoparticles and become smoother after phosphating. In particular, these silkworms on the surface of the carbon paper can provide a high porosity and more active connection points, which is advantageous to enhance the catalytic ability for the interface reaction and accelerate the electron transmission.

From the low-magnification TEM images of Fig. 3a, it can be observed clearly that the nanoscale morphologies and structure are in good agreement with the SEM results. The cross-sectional view in Fig. 3b gives us a good perspective of the surface of the CoP@FeP4@CP film, in which the CoP@FeP4 are spread on the carbon paper evenly. Evidently, we can speculate that the thickness of one layer of the CoP@FeP4 film is about 570 nm. Moreover, the result of the EDS spectrum in Fig. 3c confirms the existence of Co, Fe, and P elements, and Co is of 28.17 at%, Fe is of 26.04 at%, and P is 45.79 at%. Furthermore, the high-magnification TEM (Fig. 3d) reveals the (211) plane of CoP with a lattice fringe of 0.19 nm, and the interplanar distances of 0.35 and 0.51 nm can be indexed to (111) and (020) planes of the standard FeP4, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. Also, the Co, Fe, and P elements evenly distribute on the CoP@FeP4 surface in the mapping of Fig. 3g–i, which is in agreement with the EDS.
The XRD patterns were studied to understand the crystal structure of CoP@CP and CoP@FeP4@CP CEs as shown in Fig. S2 and Fig. 4. As depicted in Fig. S2 and Fig. 4, the diffraction peaks at 26.6 and 54.8° signed with ☆ are responsible for the carbon paper (JCPDS No. 26-1076), which corresponded to the (003) and (006) crystal planes. The diffraction peaks at 31.6, 36.7, 46.2, 48.1, and 56.8° marked with ● can be assigned to (011), (102), (112), (211), and (301) planes of CoP (JCPDS No. 29-0497), respectively. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.8, 32.4, 35.8, and 53.9° marked with ★ refer to (130), (002), (130), and (241) crystallographic planes of FeP4. Observably, these diffraction peaks agreed well with JCPDS No. 32-0471. Thus, the XRD patterns indicate that the CoP@CP and CoP@FeP4@CP films were successfully grown on carbon paper.
The XPS spectra were measured to analyze the surface elemental compositions and the phases of the samples. The XPS survey (Fig. 5a) further indicates that the surface of CoP@FeP4@CP consists mainly of Co, Fe, P elements without other impurities, which is in agreement with the EDS results. The XPS spectrum of Co 2p is presented in Fig. 5b, and two obvious peaks at 782.3 and 798.1 eV can be fitted to the Co–O bonds due to surface oxidation. The peak at 782.3 eV can be attributed to Co 2p3/2, and the peak at 798.1 eV can be assigned to Co 2p1/2. Interestingly, the characteristic peak of Co2+ can be confirmed at 786.7 eV, and the peak at 793.7 eV belongs to Co 2p1/2. One peak centered at 779.2 eV is attributed to the Co species in Co–P.
The Fe 2p XPS spectrum illustrated in Fig. 5c displays five peaks. Among them, the peaks at 707.6 and 713.0 eV belong to the characteristic peaks of Fe 2p3/2, and the peak at 717.2 eV is related to Fe3+ ions, and the peak detected at 721.3 and 726.7 eV are well matched to the Fe 2p of Fe–P. Moreover, the XPS of P 2p in Fig. 5d shows that the detection of two peaks at 129.7 and 130.6 eV can be ascribed to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 in CoP and FeP4, respectively. Meanwhile, the characteristic peak at 133.4 eV illustrated the existence of P–O bonding due to the unavoidable oxidation at the CoP surface upon exposure to air. Particularly, the Fe 2p, P 2p, and Co 2p XPS spectra reveal the existence of Co–O, Fe–P, Fe–O, and P–O bonds, which is attributed to the formation of discontinuous surface oxidation layer (Co–O–P-like or Fe–O–P species). Such an oxidation layer is natural and surface-bound due to the air-sensitive nature of CoP and FeP4.
In order to explore the catalytic effect of the CoP@FeP4@CP CE in I−/I3− redox reaction system, CV measurements were carried out in a three-electrode one-compartment cell. According to the CV curves shown in Fig. 6, each cycle has two pairs of redox peaks, and the left one in the potential interval of −0.4 to 0.4 V has an important impact on the performance of the DSSC. Generally, electrons are injected into the photo-oxidized dye from I− ions for 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−, and then the produced I3− ions are reduced on the CE for I3− + 2e− → 3I− in DSSC, which is helpful for the recycling of dye molecules. As is known, a large absolute value of cathodic current density (Ipc) and a small absolute value of cathodic peak potential (Vpc) for the CE means that it has superior electrical conductivity and good catalytic ability. Fig. 6a shows the CVs of the CP@FP@CP CEs with different concentrations of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, in which the three CP@FP@CP CEs possess a similar Vpc. However, the CP@FP@CP-2 CE generates the largest |Ipc| compared to the others, indicating the most excellent conductivity and the catalytic ability for CP@FP@CP-2 CE. To further study the electrochemical performance of CP@FP@CP-2 CE, Fig. 6b displays the CVs of CoP@CP, CP@FP@CP-2, and Pt CEs at the scan rate of 0.06 V s−1, in which the CP@FP@CP-2 CE exhibits a much larger absolute value of Ipc than that of CoP@CP and Pt CEs, indicating good electrocatalytic properties. This result shows a good electrocatalytic activity for CP@FP@CP-2 CE compared to that of Pt CE. The CVs of different CP@FP@CP CEs with various scan rates in I−/I3− electrolyte are exhibited in Fig. 6c–e. It can be clearly seen that the values of |Ipc| and |Vpc| gradually and regularly increases with increasing scan rate in the three figures, but the change of the curvature of Fig. 6d is the greatest. This phenomenon demonstrates that the electrochemical reaction rate on the electrode surface also increases as the scanning rate increases. In addition, in order to investigate the stability of the CP@FP@CP-2 CE, 50-cycles CVs were studied at the scan rate of 0.06 V s−1 and are presented in Fig. 6f. It can be seen that there is no obvious change in the curves of CP@FP@CP-2 CE. This phenomenon suggests that CP@FP@CP-2 CE possesses excellent electrochemical stability.
EIS was performed using two identical CEs with I−/I3− electrolyte as shown in Fig. 7, in which the high frequency intercept of the real axis is associated with the series resistance (Rs) of the electrolyte and electrodes; and the semicircle symbolized the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for I3− reduction at the electrolyte/CE interface, and the resultant EIS parameters are also listed in Table 2. Generally, Rct is inversely correlated with the charge transfer resistance between CE and the electrolyte. The CE with small Rct stands for its good electrochemical performance and is conducive to improving the photovoltaic performance for the DSSC.

As seen in Fig. 7a, the CP@FP@CP-2 CE shows smaller Rct (2.59 Ω cm2) than that of CP@FP@CP-1 (11.35 Ω cm2) and CP@FP@CP-3 (97.76 Ω cm2) CEs, indicating good electrocatalytic activity for CP@FP@CP-2 CE. In order to further prove the advantages of CP@FP@CP-2 CE, the EIS of Pt, CoP@CP, and CP@FP@CP-2 CEs were measured, and the results are presented in Fig. 7b. From Table 2 and Fig. 7b, the Rct of CP@FP@CP-2 CE is much smaller than that of Pt (7.82 Ω cm2) and CoP@CP (4.39 Ω cm2) CEs, indicating excellent electrochemical performance for CP@FP@CP-2 CE. The improvement of electrochemical performances for the CE mainly comes from two results. Firstly, the surface morphology of the CP@FP@CP-2 CE like silkworm structure provides more active sites for I3− reduction and large surface area for the charge transfer at the interface of the electrolyte–electrode to further boost the catalytic activity of CE; secondly, the CP@FP@CP-2 CE is magnetic, and electron deviates from the compound center for the Lorentz force, which is advantageous to improve the effective collection of electrons.

Fig. 8 shows the Tafel polarization curves for various CEs. The curve is affected by the interfacial charge-transfer property, which consists of the polarization region, the Tafel region, and the diffusion region. The current at high potential (Jlim) means the diffusion rate of I3− and the curve slope corresponds to exchange current density (J0). Usually, the electrocatalytic performance is positively correlated with J0 and Jlim.Fig. 8a shows Tafel curves of different CP@FP@CP CEs. It is found that the values of J0 and Jlim have the same trend and are in the order CP@FP@CP-2 > CP@FP@CP-1 > CP@FP@CP-3 CEs. This indicates that the CP@FP@CP-2 CE possesses optimal catalytic ability. Fig. 8b shows Tafel curves of the Pt, CoP@CP, and CP@FP@CP-2 CEs. The result shows that CP@FP@CP-2 CE obtains much larger J0 and Jlim than that of CoP@CP and Pt CEs, meaning CP@FP@CP-2 CE has a higher conductivity and excellent catalytic activity than that of CoP@CP and Pt CEs.
The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured for further investigations of the charge transfer and transporting of the CEs. As depicted in Fig. 9a and Table 1, the emission lifetimes of various CP@FP@CP CEs are in the order, CP@FP@CP-2 < CP@FP@CP-1 < CP@FP@CP-3, indicating the fastest charge transfer rate for CP@FP@CP-2 CE. Compared to CoP@CP and Pt CEs, the CP@FP@CP-2 CE generates a much smaller emission lifetime of 4.16 ns than that of CoP@CP (15.17 ns) and Pt (36.60 ns) CEs. It suggests that the charge transfer of CP@FP@CP-2 CE is comparable to that of Pt CE.

J–V curves of DSSCs with different CEs under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 are displayed in Fig. 10, and the corresponding results are given in Table 2. From Fig. 10a, it can be seen clearly that the DSSC with CP@FP@CP-2 CE shows perfect curves with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and good fill factor (FF) compared to that of DSSCs with CP@FP@CP-1 and CP@FP@CP-3 CEs. The corresponding PECs of DSSCs with CP@FP@CP-1, CP@FP@CP-2, and CP@FP@CP-3 CEs are 7.49%, 9.88%, and 7.38%. The reason can be attributed to the good electrocatalytic activity and low electrochemical impedance of CP@FP@CP-2 CE. In order to further investigate the performance of CP@FP@CP-2 CE, solar cells based on CoP@CP, Pt, and CP@FP@CP-2 CEs were also assembled and measured under the same experimental conditions. From Fig. 10b and Table 2, it is apparent that the DSSC assembled with CP@FP@CP-2 CE achieves a PCE of 9.88%, which exhibits a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V, Jsc of 23.10 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.62. The DSSCs based on Pt and CoP@CP CEs generate PCE of 7.49% and 8.73%, respectively, which is much lower than that of the cell with CP@FP@CP-2 CE. This can be attributed to the better electrocatalytic activity and conductivity of CP@FP@CP-2 CE than that of Pt and CoP@CP CEs. To further verify the photovoltaic performance of the cell in different light bands, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs with CoP@CP, Pt, and CP@FP@CP-2 CEs were measured and are displayed in Fig. 10c. The IPCE of the DSSC based on CP@FP@CP-2 CE remarkably shows a wider absorption range from 300 to 810 nm compared to those of the cells with CoP@CP and Pt CEs (300–750 nm). Particularly, the DSSC based on CP@FP@CP-2 CE obtained the highest peak at 530 nm, which is much higher than that of cells with CoP@CP and Pt CEs. The reasons for the improved performance of the solar cell with CP@FP@CP-2 CE can be attributed to the following factors. Firstly, the CP@FP@CP-2 CE with unique morphology and structure and excellent electrocatalytic activity and conductivity is responsible for good photovoltaic performances. Secondly, the magnetic CE material is beneficial to the improvement of solar cell performance. It is well known that electrons moving in a magnetic field are subject to Lorentz forces. Therefore, the effect of the Lorentz force may cause the electrons to deviate from part of the recombination center, thus improving the effective collection of electrons. In addition, as an important evaluation criterion for the DSSCs, the reproducibility of 30 solar cells based on CP@FP@CP-2 CE were measured and showed an average PCE of 9.88%, as displayed in Fig. 10d, demonstrating good reproducibility of photovoltaic performance. When it comes to actual device applications, the DSSCs long-term stability is the most crucial feature to consider. As a consequence, a long-term stability test of the cells was performed under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, as revealed in Fig. S3. After 480 h of light radiance, there was only a tiny difference in the PCE. The efficiency of the DSSC with CP@FP@CP-2 CE decreased rapidly at the beginning and then gradually decreased. The overall efficiency of the cell decreased by 8.2% in 480 h, which has good stability.

Fig. 11 shows the EIS of various DSSCs to further study the transmission of electrons in cells. The high frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The semicircle at the high frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding chemical capacitance (Cdl) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, while the other one at the low frequency region refers to the Nernst diffusion impedance (Zw) of the triiodide/iodide redox couple in the electrolyte. Especially, the Rct is negatively related to the cells’ performance.Fig. 11 presents the DSSCs assembled with Pt, CoP@CP, and CP@FP@CP-2 CEs, in which the DSSC assembled with CP@FP@CP-2 CE generates the smallest semicircle. It means the minimum Rct for the CP@FP@CP-2 CE compared to those of cells based on Pt and CoP@CP CEs. The result further confirmed the reason for the excellent electrocatalytic activity and good electrons transmission performance for the DSSC assembled with CP@FP@CP-2 CE. This result is in agreement with the CVs, EIS, Tafel curves, and the J–V results, which has shown once again that the catalytic reduction capability of CP@FP@CP-2 CE is comparable to the Pt CE.

In summary, the CoP@FeP4@CP CE was successfully synthesized on carbon paper using facile hydrothermal approach and high temperature phosphating method and served as CE in DSSC. Under the optimum conditions (molar concentration of (Co(NO3)2·6H2O):Fe(NO3)3·9H2O = 1:1), the DSSC based on CP@FP@CP-2 CE shows an optimum power conversion efficiency of 9.88% under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which is much higher than that of Pt (7.49%) and CoP@CP (8.73%) CEs. The CP@FP@CP-2 CE shows good electrocatalytic activity due to its unique morphology and structure observed through SEM. Moreover, extensive electrochemical studies such as CVs, EIS, and Tafel measurements have also shown good electrocatalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance in I−/I3− redox reaction for the synergy effect of CP@FP@CP-2 CE. This work offers a valuable way to design transition metal magnetic phosphates composites to replace Pt for electrocatalytic triiodide reduction, but also demonstrates that the magnetic CP@FP@CP-2 CE is a potential low-cost and Pt-free CE for DSSCs.
