High-temperature sulfoselenization is essential in producing Cu2ZnSn (S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells. At high temperature, the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 phase-transition speed is fast, which causes grain transition to mature quickly, followed by grain decomposition. Although grain surfaces are relatively flat at low temperatures, the small grain and more grain boundaries lead to low efficiency. In this study, a dynamic-temperature sulfoselenization process was adopted to utilize both the advantages of high and low temperatures comprehensively. Different constant- and variable-temperature sulfoselenization processes were developed for annealing Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursor films prepared in the air using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 2-methoxyethanol (MOE) dual solvent systems. As a result, CZTSSe films with a flat, holeless, and dense surface, and a single-layer large grain penetrating the whole cross-section were fabricated by a proper variable-temperature sulfoselenization process. Finally, 11.11% total-area power conversion efficiency (12.22% active area efficiency) of CZTSSe solar cells (without antireflection coating) based on the variable-temperature sulfoselenization process was achieved successfully. Compared with the highest efficiency of 9.10% of CZTSSe film solar cells fabricated from the stable-temperature sulfoselenization annealing process, the efficiency was improved by 22%. The variable-temperature annealing processes in this study can also be applied to the preparation of other multi-element thin-film semiconductor materials.

Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells with earth-abundant and environmentally benign constituents are regarded as one of the most promising thin-film photovoltaic technologies for offering a low-cost solar-energy option. However, along with the inherent advantages of CZTSSe and the unwavering efforts of researchers, the record efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells has only improved from a figure of 13% certified in 2021 to 13.6% in 2022. The main factors limiting the CZTSSe efficiency are its low values of Voc/(Eg/q) of <70% (Voc: open-circuit voltage) and also common FF (fill factor) of <72%, where Eg is the band gap energy of the kesterite absorber and q is the electronic charge. By comparison, the highest efficiency of the analogous crystal structure Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) film device has reached 23.35%, with the main limiting parameters being its Voc/(Eg/q) of 80.77% and FF of 80.4%. Many intrinsic cation-related disorders and defects in CZTSSe films are responsible for their low Voc and FF values. As a result, numerous research groups are dedicated to reducing CZTSSe defects by using +1-valent cations (Ag, Li) and +2-valent cations (Cd, Mn) to replace part of the Cu and Zn, which can suppress Cu/Zn disorders and reduce Cu/Zn defects. Furthermore, doping with +3-valent cations reduces the Zn- and Sn-related defects, whereas doping with +4-valent cations reduces the Sn-related deep-level defects. These methods have indeed improved the efficiency, but the highest efficiency of the CZTSSe device at present is still less than 15% for commercial applications. Thus, further optimization of the device fabrication process, especially for the grain growth of the CZTSSe absorber layer, may facilitate an improvement in efficiency. For CZTSSe films prepared by the chemical solution method, the preparation of the Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursor solution and the following high-temperature sulfoselenization determine the crystal quality of the CZTSSe films. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2-methoxyethanol (MOE), and thioglycolic acid (TGA) are currently used as the mainstream non-hydrazine solvents, and the precursor films must undergo complex phase-transition processes. Xin's research group proposed the usage of Sn4+ instead of Sn2+ for direct phase transition, which could effectively reduce the surface defects and lower the voltage loss to less than 300 mV. Furthermore, using Sn2+ as the precursor could generate some secondary phases during annealing. Further optimization of the Sn4+ crystal growth process can help reduce the secondary phases and improve the efficiency.

On the other hand, the preparation process of the CZTSSe absorber layer inevitably goes through a continuous above 560 °C high-temperature annealing of the Cu–Zn–Sn–S precursor film (sulfurization, selenization, sulfoselenization). However, ongoing high-temperature treatment usually brings about a series of side effects, such as the loss of Sn, the decomposition of CZTSSe into a secondary phase, and the formation of a thick Mo(S,Se)2 layer, all of which are detrimental to the performance of a device. Furthermore, the high-temperature-tolerance requirement for substrates makes it impossible to vigorously develop flexible substrates and roll-to-roll technology. On the contrary, utilizing a lower annealing-temperature treatment could fabricate a CZTSSe film layer with a dense and flat surface, along with smaller grains, thus increasing the number of grain boundaries to reduce the corresponding device performance. So far, most research groups have used a low-temperature soft-sulfoselenization followed by continuous high-temperature annealing to complete the CZTSSe crystal growth. Meng's research group discovered that high temperature accelerated phase transition, while low temperature promoted the formation of smooth and dense films, achieving an efficiency of 12.5% for a CZTSSe device, which emphasized that the process of sulfoselenization plays a crucial role in the crystal quality and device performance of CZTSSe solar cells.
Overall, higher temperature sulfoselenization (570 °C) favors rapid phase transformation and large grains, but continuous high temperature leads to the decomposition of the CZTSSe phase. Conversely, low-temperature (510 °C) sulfoselenization makes the film's surface relatively dense, but the crystal grains remain small and porous. So, investigating the compatibility of a proper heating strategy with the growth of CZTSSe should help improve the efficiency further. In the present study, a variable-temperature sulfoselenization strategy was explored to improve the film quality of CZTSSe and achieve higher efficiency. First, the temperature was o from 510 °C to 570 °C within 7 min, during which the nucleation finished, and grain growth began rapidly. Then, the temperature was slowly reduced to 510 °C in 7 min to prevent grain overgrowth. Compared with only annealing 570 °C for 14 min and dynamic annealing for 14 min, the CZTSSe film demonstrated a smoother and denser surface by dynamic annealing for 14 min as described above.
Furthermore, the grains grown via dynamic annealing for 14 min were more prominent than those obtained by the constant low-temperature 510 °C annealing for 14 min. On this basis, the annealing conditions were further investigated. Specifically, the sulfoselenization at a high temperature of 570 °C experienced once as described above (marked as 1H), twice (denoted as 2H), and three times (denoted as 3H), respectively. The high and low temperatures showed close to linear changes considering the rapid phase transition and film compactness. The effects of these different variable-temperature sulfoselenization processes on the properties of CZTSSe films and devices were investigated. Finally, under optimized dynamic annealing, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.11% (0.11 cm2, active area efficiency of 12.22%) was achieved. CZTSSe thin-film solar cells based on the described variable-temperature sulfoselenization process were obtained by improving the crystal quality, displaying an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 504 mV, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 34.2 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 64.36%.

Cu/Zn + Sn = 0.721 and Zn/Sn = 1.14 were determined as the initial ratios in the precursor solution. First, 1.1327 g of thiourea (99%, Innochem), 0.3326 g of CuCl (99.9%, Aladdin), 0.7608 of SnCl4·5H2O (99.995%, Aladdin), and 0.5444 g of Zn (CH3COOH)2. 2H2O (99.99%, Aladdin) were weighed accurately and then added to a solvent mixture of 2 mL of DMSO (99.9%, Aladdin) and 2 mL of MOE (99.8%, Aladdin). The solution was stirred in a 60 °C water bath for 3 h to obtain a pale-yellow CZTS precursor solution. Then the CZTS precursor solution was spin-coated on a Mo-coated soda-lime glass at 3000 rpm for 20 s and 4500 rpm for 10 s. After spin-coating, the film was placed on a hot plate at 300 °C baking for 2 min. For each film, the above spin-coating and sintering process was repeated 13 times to obtain a 1.2 μm thick CZTS precursor film. It should be emphasized that all the above solution preparations, spin-coatings, and baking processes were carried out not in the glove box but in the air.

Fig. 1 shows the temperature profiles of five different sulfoselenization processes. Here, 300 mg of selenium pellets (99.999%, Aladdin) was placed in a graphite box to provide only the selenium source, and 15 mg of SeS2 (97%, Aladdin) was used to provide sulfur and selenium sources during the sulfoselenization stage. The sulfoselenization was done in a heated quartz furnace (OTF-1200X) under a N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the initial heating was applied from room temperature to 280 °C in 9 min, followed by soft-sulfoselenization at 280 °C for 10 min, and continuous heating from 280 °C to 510 °C, and these were the same for all five different sulfoselenization processes. For simplicity, the CZTSSe film of the five different annealing processes were abbreviated as follows: CZTSSe-510 °C-14 min as the abbreviation for sulfoselenization at a constant temperature of 510 °C for 14 min, CZTSSe-570 °C-14 min for sulfoselenization annealing at a stable temperature of 570 °C for 14 min, CZTSSe-1H-14 min for a single-stage variable-temperature sulfoselenization for 14 min (510 °C–570 °C–510 °C), CZTSSe-2H-14 min for a two-stage variable-temperature sulfoselenization (510 °C–570 °C–510 °C–570 °C–510 °C) for 14 min, and CZTSSe-3H-14 min for a three-stage variable-temperature sulfoselenization (510 °C–570 °C–510 °C–570 °C–510 °C–570 °C–510 °C) for 14 min. The detailed time–temperature profiles of CZTSSe-1H-14 min, CZTSSe-2H-14 min, and CZTSSe-3H-14 min are shown in Fig. 1(b). After the sulfoselenization, the films were cooled down to room temperature naturally.
A 50 nm-thick CdS buffer layer was deposited on the CZTSSe film at 75 °C by chemical water bath deposition. Then, 50 nm i-ZnO and 260 nm indium tin oxide (ITO) were further coated by radio frequency (R.F.) sputtering using a magnetron sputtering system. The Ni–Al surface electrode was prepared by the thermal evaporation method. Here, it should be emphasized that no antireflection coating was applied. Finally, the thin film was mechanically divided into solar cells with a total area of 0.11 cm2.
To study each film's crystal structure and phase purity, XRD characterization was conducted using a Rigaku Ultima VI type system, and Raman measurements were carried out using a WiTech alpha300R instrument. An Oxford Quorum SC7620 sputtering coater sprayed gold on the CZTSSe film surface. To observe the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the films, SEM surface and cross-section testing were carried out using a Tescan Mira Lms system, and an Xplore instrument was used for the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement analysis. The current density–voltage of the films was measured using a Keithley 2400, and EQE tests were performed using an Enlitech qe-r3018 system.

Thedifferent staged films were named as CZTSSe-510 °C-0 min (510 °C-0), CZTSSe-510 °C-14 min (510 °C-14), CZTSSe-570 °C-14 min (510 °C-14), CZTSSe-1H-14 min(1H-14), CZTSSe-2H-14 min(2H-14), CZTSSe-3H-14 min(3H-14), and other stages followed this pattern.

The change in the diffraction peak intensities of different crystal planes in the XRD patterns is an intuitive reflection of the preferred orientation growth selection of a polycrystalline film and reflects the phase information. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of CZTSSe films prepared using the same soft-sulfoselenizaation at 280 °C for 10 min, 510 °C for 0 min, and different sulfoselenization processes. According to Fig. 2(a), all the CZTSSe films were composed of an apparent kesterite structure without obvious secondary phase peaks, except for the soft-sulfoselenizaation film at 280 °C for 10 min (ESI, Fig. S1). Especially important, all the CZTSSe films with different constant high temperatures (510 °C for 14 min and 570 °C for 14 min) and variable-temperature sulfoselenization processes displayed three strong peaks for (112), (220), and (312), which resemble the standard cards of kesterite films (CZTS JCPDS#26–0575 and CZTSe JCPDS#52–0868). In the case of all the films, the intensity of the (112) plane increased preferentially. The rise in the intensity of the (112) main peak (kesterite phase CZTSSe) indicated the internal adjustment of more grains along the (112) plane, which resulted in a better crystal quality because numerous previous papers have reported that CZTSSe films exhibit the kesterite structure with preferential orientation along the (112) direction. With the times of high–low temperature variation increasing, the intensity of the (112) peak increases and then decreases, showing the best quality of crystals under 2H-14 conditions. The main peak of the (112) plane was gradually left-shifted with the increase in the number of high-temperature alterations, as clearly shown in Fig. 2(b), which demonstrates that more Se was incorporated into the film. To be specific, the main peak of the (112) plane of the film-280 °C (10 min) mainly contained the sulfur element, and its peak position was at 28.32° (Fig. S1, ESI). As the sulfoselenization process continued, more Se element replaced the S element, and the (112) peak position gradually moved to a smaller angle. Also, the corresponding full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreased, the peak intensity increased, and the (112) peak position of the final film was located at 27.26°, as shown in Fig. 2(b). To further investigate the properties of the variable-temperature sulfoselenization processes in detail, three additional different sulfoselenization processes (510 °C–570 °C–510 °C for 7 min, marked as 1H-7, 510 °C–570 °C–510 °C–570 °C–570 °C–510 °C, for 7 min denoted as 2H-7, and 510 °C–570 °C–510 °C–570 °C–510 °C–570 °C–510 °C, represented as 3H-7, respectively) were also adopted to prepare CZTSSe films. Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the XRD patterns of these CZTSSe films, which demonstrated similar properties to those of CZTSSe films based on 1H-14, 2H-14, and 3H-14 sulfoselenization processes.
Table 1 lists the diffraction angle, intensity, and FWHM values of the (112) peak of the CZTSSe films prepared by different sulfoselenization processes. The change in the intensity of the (112) plane and the difference in the FWHM value can reflect the change in the crystalline properties of the CZTSSe film. Table 1 shows a clear inverse relationship between the diffraction angle (2-theta) of the (112) plane and its corresponding FWHM value. The increase in the intensity of the (112) plane accompanying a gradual reduction in FWHM with variable temperature indicates that the variable-temperature sulfoselenization favors improvements in the crystallinity of the CZTSSe films. Compared with the 510 °C-14 and 570 °C-14 films based on a conventional constant low- or high-temperature annealing process, the 1H-14 film from the variable-temperature process showed a better crystalline quality due to both the stronger (112) peak and smaller FWHM value. However, the intensity of the (112) peak of the 3H-14 film obtained from a three-stage variable-temperature sulfoselenization was reduced. The corresponding diffraction angle also moved to be the smallest. Still, the FWHM was significantly larger than that for 2H-14 based on a two-stage variable-temperature sulfoselenization process, demonstrating a poorer crystalline quality than for the 2H-14 films, which could directly affect a device's efficiency. According to the data listed in Table 1, it could be concluded that CZTSSe films with better crystalline quality could be prepared by a proper variable-temperature sulfoselenization process.

Raman spectroscopy is often used to analyze the microstructure and phase purity of CZTSSe thin films. Herein, Raman spectroscopy was performed using a 532 nm laser to excite the film at the two regions selected for all the Raman analyses. Fig. 3(a) shows the Raman spectra of CZTSSe film films prepared using the different sulfoselenization conditions, including the constant-temperature 510 °C-0 min, 510 °C-14 min, 570 °C-14 min, and variable-temperature (1H-14, 2H-14 and 3H-14) sulfoselenization methods. The actual experimental data spectra showed that the Raman spectra of the different regions were almost coincident, which indicated that the film uniformity of sulfoselenization at each stage was excellent. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that even for the CZTSSe film based on the 510 °C-0 min process, two distinct A1 vibrational modes appeared in the Raman spectra, which belong to the CZTSe and CZTS, respectively. In fact, for the CZTS precursor subjected to soft-sulfoselenizaation at 280 °C for 10 min, a considerably sharp A1 mode of CZTS has already emerged (ESI, Fig. S2). In addition, the broad Raman peak in the 200–250 cm−1 region may be from Se, which was deposited on the film surface during film cooling. After annealing at 510 °C for 14 min, the A1 mode of CZTSSe became sharp and red-shifted toward 197 cm−1, which was very close to the A1 vibration mode peak of the kesterite phase CZTSe at 196 cm−1. Also, the CZTS A1 mode got weaker and was shifted to lower wavenumbers, which confirmed that Se had replaced more S. Moreover, the Raman modes at 176 and 235 cm−1 belonging to CZTSSe also emerged, demonstrating that the annealing time can affect CZTSSe phase formation under a proper temperature.
Furthermore, when keeping the sulfoselenization time at 14 min while increasing the annealing temperature from 510 °C to 570 °C, the CZTSe A1 mode displayed a red-shift, and the CZTS A1 mode also became weaker, which indicated that more of the CZTS phase had been converted into CZTSSe. Interestingly, for the CZTSSe based on the variable-temperature sulfoselenization process from 1H-14 to 2H-14, then to 3H-14, the change trends of the A1 mode of both CZTS and CZTSSe were the same as that with constant-temperature annealing at 510 °C holding there for 14 min or at 570 °C keeping there for 14 min. To be more concise, compared with the process at 510 °C for 14 min, the A1 mode of the CZTSSe film from 1H-14 was red-shifted, and the CZTS A1 mode became weaker with the temperature changing from 510 °C to 570 °C during annealing, which also indicated that the annealing temperature is a crucial factor that can affect CZTSSe phase transformation quickly, Also, this could be proved by the Raman shift difference between the CZTSSe film based on keeping the temperature stable at 570 °C for 14 min and from the variable 1H-14 process. Compared with the 2H-14 sulfoselenization process, the Raman peak position of the CZTSSe film from 3H-14 was also changed obviously, which was attributed to the material undergoing multiple high–low temperature changes during the sulfoselenization process. The more specific A1 mode position shift of CZTSSe films based on the two different sulfoselenization processes can be observed in Fig. 3(b). To further elucidate the effects of the high–low temperature variation process on the CZTSSe phase formation, the Raman spectra of the CZTSSe films based on 1H-7, 2H-7, and 3H-7 are also shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), which demonstrated similar Raman peak shifts to those of the 1H-14, 2H-14, and 3H-14 variable-temperature processes, except that the 2H-7 and 3H-7 processes showed little change in the peak position, mainly due to the rapid growth of grains under the rapid high- and low-temperature alteration. Finally, according to the above results, no obvious and unidentified other modes were observed in the Raman spectra of the CZTSSe films based on the different sulfoselenization processes, especially for the high–low temperature-variation processes of 1H-14, 2H-14, and 3H-14, which was also consistent with the XRD results, indicating that the prepared absorber layer was in the phase of CZTSSe.
A large grain size is beneficial to improving the efficiency of devices, and so the grain size is considered one of the important reference factors to judge the quality of films. SEM was performed to understand the grain size and morphology alteration of the CZTSSe films based on the different annealing processes. Fig. S3 (ESI) and Fig. 4 show the surface images of CZTSSe films prepared via different constant-temperature and variable-temperature processes during short-time (7 min) or long-time (14 min) sulfoselenizaation. The change in the grain size can be observed clearly by the SEM surface topography. To be more concise, the surface topography of a film prepared at 280 °C for 10 min (soft-sulfoselenization) shown in Fig. S3 (a) (ESI) shows the crystal nucleation stage of the film.
Meanwhile, the Cu-based metal on the surface layer reacts with the S element in the precursor to form a copper-rich phase material with a small amount of CZTS crystals. As the temperature rose from 280 °C to 510 °C, a small number of CZTSSe crystal nuclei were created and grew into angular crystal grains, as shown in Fig. S3(b) (ESI). With the sulfoselenization time increasing, the accumulation of Se element on the surface layer triggered the liquid phase-assisted growth mechanism, which promoted the transport of metal elements and accelerated CZTSSe crystal growth and the grains tended to mature. However, the surface of the 510 °C-14 film demonstrated small grains and many holes due to the short-time sulfoselenization and low annealing temperature, leading to poor grain maturity, which negatively affected the photoelectric conversion performance. With the sulfoselenization temperature increasing from 510 °C to 570 °C, the CZTSSe grains became more considerable, which confirmed that the annealing temperature plays a vital role in grain growth, but the grain density on the surface of the 570 °C-14 film decreased gradually, and the grains showed an island-like distribution with some pores due to the fast CZTSSe phase transition under high temperature. According to these results, it can be deduced that different high–low temperature-change processes would greatly influence the properties of the CZTSSe absorber layer film, provided the other conditions are the same. As a result, compared with the 510 °C-14 film, although the CZTSSe films based on the 1H-14 process also showed unevenly distributed grains, the grains were larger, and the surface was denser with fewer holes.
Furthermore, the 2H-14 absorber layer presented more large grains and a compact surface without holes compared to that of 1H-14, which represented an ideal absorber layer morphology for preparing solar cells with high efficiency. This is because a large grain size can reduce the number of grain boundaries per unit area to cause photogenerated–carrier recombination and increase the diffusion length of minority carriers due to their enhanced lifetime and Hall mobility. Moreover, a dense CSTSSe surface can combine with the CdS buffer layer to form a PN junction with good properties. As a result, both the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) would be improved.
With the times of the high–low temperature variations increasing, the 3H-14 film demonstrated overgrown grains, decreasing the surface flatness, as shown in Fig. 4(e). Moreover, the over-ripening of the grains may have led to CZTSSe phase decomposition, which would not favor highly efficient devices. To further comprehend the effects of the high–low temperature changes on the grain growth and surface morphology of the CZTSSe film, top-view images of films based on different high–low temperature variations during the same short time (7 min) are also shown in Fig. S3(c, d and e) in the ESI. Under these conditions, the grain size and surface morphology changes are generally similar to high–low temperature variations over a longer time (14 min). The difference in the grain size indicated that the rapid temperature rise during the variable-temperature sulfoselenization for a short time can also promote the growth of grains. However, the crystallization may not be complete due to the short annealing time. Based on the surface morphology and grain size discussed above, the 2H-14 film is considered more suitable for fabricating photovoltaic devices than the others due to its flat and dense surface morphology and prominent grains.
To investigate the effects of variable-temperature sulfoselenization on longitudinal grain growth, SEM was also performed for the cross-sectional images, and Fig. 5 shows the cross-sectional views of the CZTSSe films based on different annealing processes. After soft- sulfoselenization at 280 °C for 10 min, the film demonstrated a compact and uniform CZTS amorphous layer, which agreed well with the XRD and Raman results discussed above. With the annealing time and temperature increasing, the 510 °C-14 film presented a whole CZTSSe small grain layer due to incomplete grain ripening. With the temperature rising to 570 °C, the CZTSSe film showed an entirely significant grain spanning layer due to the sufficient grain growth, confirming the effect of the annealing temperature on the grain growth. However, the 510 °C-14 and 570 °C-14 films contained some voids distributed in the cross-section, which may be common for CZTSSe film layers prepared by continuous high-temperature annealing. These voids can seriously hinder the transport of photogenerated carriers, thus leading to a reduction in the JSC of a device. While the 1H-7 absorber layer displayed a whole layer still consisting of small grains due to the short annealing time, with the high–low temperature variation increasing, the 2H-7 and 3H-7 films demonstrated double-layer structures, comprising a top large grain layer and a small grain layer at the bottom.
Moreover, the 2H-7 absorber layer had a few voids between the film and Mo back-electrode. Compared with the 510 °C-14 and 1H-7 films, the cross-sectional morphology of the 1H-14 film was improved by the larger grains grown due to the high–low temperature change occurring for a more extended time. However, the 1H-14 absorber layer had poor contact with Mo because of the many voids between the film and Mo layer existing. With the times of the high–low temperature variation increasing, the 2H-14 film showed a compact and void-less layer with large grains extending through the whole thickness of the film, which would allow forming good contact with Mo and presenting an ideal cross-sectional configuration for charge-carrier longitudinal transport. Compared with the 2H-14 film, the 3H-14 film demonstrated a layered structure with some voids in the cross-section. However, film decomposition may arise due to the lowering of the Se vapor pressure and the continuous ripening or agglomeration under long-time high-temperature annealing. Furthermore, there were large holes in the absorber layer, which may have been generated due to the rapid loss of elements during the high-temperature annealing process. According to these results, it can be concluded that a dense CZTSSe film layer with large grains spanning the whole thickness of the film for highly efficient device performance could be obtained based on a proper variable-temperature sulfoselenization process, here, the 2H-14 annealing process, which was also consistent with the XRD, Raman, and surface SEM image results discussed above.
The chemical elemental composition of CZTSSe film at each stage of sulfoselenization was obtained by EDS measurements. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 6. For the 510 °C-0 film, CZTSSe was already formed, which agreed well with the XRD, Raman, and SEM results. With the annealing time and temperature increasing, the anion compositions were largely changed, while the cation compositions demonstrated little difference. Specifically, the content of the Se element composition increased, while the S content was reduced significantly, which again confirmed that Se substituted more S due to the competition between Se and S. After reaching 510 °C, the contents of Cu and Sn elements gradually stabilized.
In contrast, the content of the Zn element increased significantly after sulfoselenization at 510 °C-14 and then gradually stabilized. In the same way, with the times of the high–low temperature variation increasing, the interpretation of the chemical composition showed similar results as above. Calculating each element's content, as shown in Fig. 6, showed that all the CZTSSe films based on the different sulfoselenization annealing processes belonged to copper-poor and zinc-rich configurations, which is desired for highly efficient devices. This is because both the deep-level point defect SnZn as serious recombination centers and (2CuZn + SnZn) defect clusters resulting in a shrinkage of the band gap can be suppressed under copper-poor and zinc-rich cases.
The surface EDS mapping of the 2H-14 film was performed and is shown in Fig. 7. Both Se and S elements were uniformly dispersed on the film's surface, except there was less S. Meanwhile, the distribution of Cu, Zn, and Sn elements was also uniform, in addition to the obviously less Sn, which was consistent with the Zn-rich conditions. As a result, CZTSSe films with the element composition distributed evenly could be prepared by an appropriate variable-temperature sulfoselenization annealing process.

Solar cells using CZTSSe films based on different sulfoselenization processes as active layers were fabricated according to the common structure of Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ni–Al. The critical properties of the CZTSSe devices were measured and are shown in Fig. 8. Meanwhile, the detailed device parameters are given in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 8(a) and Table 2, the performances of the CZTSSe solar cells were significantly improved by the variable-temperature sulfoselenization. The efficiency of the 2H-14 solar cell device was 11.11%, with a Jsc of 34.24 mA cm−2, Voc of 504.3 mV, and FF of 64.36%. On the contrary, the efficiencies of CZTSSe devices based on a stable high-temperature and a low-temperature sulfoselenization processes were much lower than that of devices from the variable-temperature sulfoselenization. At the same time, the low efficiencies of the solar cells prepared by the constant-temperature processes of 510 °C-14 (8.91%) and 570 °C-14 (9.10%) were due to the relatively low Voc (470.5mV) and Jsc (32.12 mA cm−2), respectively. With a proper variable-temperature treatment, the J–V curve of the 2H-14 cell was a little close to a rectangle, which intuitively indicated the best fill factor and device performance, because the FF is one of the essential parameters for improving device efficiency. To be more specific, the factor increased from 54.88% (570 °C-14) and 55.75% (510 °C-14) to 64.36% (2H-14), and indeed was higher than 60% for all the variable-temperature sulfoselenization devices mainly due to lower series resistance, as shown in Table 2. Furthermore, the reduction of the series resistance Rs from 3.63 Ω cm2 (510 °C-14) and 4.42 Ω cm2 (570 °C-14) to 2.30 Ω cm2 (2H-14) by the variable-temperature sulfoselenization also indicated the charge-carrier transport capacities of the CZTSSe films were enhanced, thus causing a rise in Jsc from 33.99 mA cm−2 (510 °C-14) and 32.13 mA cm−2 (570 °C-14) to 34.24 mA cm−2 (2H-14). Compared with those of the 13.6% high-efficiency CZTSSe thin-film solar cells, both the Voc, and FF of the 2H-14 device were relatively low due to the large Rs (> 1 Ω cm2) and low shunt resistance (Rsh) (<500 Ω cm2), which means that the parasitic resistance of the 2H-14 device should be improved next. From the EQE spectra of the five cells from different sulfoselenization processes shown in Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that the maximum EQE of the 2H-14 device reached 92.1% at the wavelength of 550 nm and presented the highest value at the wavelength range from 500 to 1000 nm, which was attributed to the improvement in the absorber crystal quality through the proper variable-temperature sulfoselenization process. Compared with the 510 °C-14 and 3H-14 devices, the higher short wavelength losses of the 570 °C-14, 1H-14, and 2H-14 devices were mainly due to the larger thickness of the CdS layer, as noted from the surface morphology differences between them. To reduce the loss of buffer layer absorption, the deposition time of CdS buffer layers on 570 °C-14, 1H-14, and 2H-14 thin-film surfaces should be optimized in future work.

The band gap (Eg) values of CZTSSe devices based on different sulfoselenization processes were obtained by extracting the EQE data and are shown in Fig. 8(c). The Eg values of the 510 °C-14, 570 °C-14, 1H-14, 2H-14, and 3H-14 devices were 1.19, 1.17, 1.16, 1.16, and 1.14 eV, respectively. Obviously, with the annealing temperature increasing from 510 °C to 570 °C, Eg was reduced by 20 meV due to more sulfur being replaced by Se. In the same way, Eg also decreased with the periods of high–low-temperature variation increasing. It should be pointed out that Eg was the same for the 1H-14 and 2H-14 devices, but the better contact with molybdenum and fewer voids in the absorber layer of the latter was the reason for the higher Jsc.
The tail states of the five devices based on different annealing processes were evaluated by the Urbach energy (Eu) extracted from the EQE data shown in Fig. 8(d). The Eu values for the variable-temperature sulfoselenization devices were significantly smaller than those for the constant-temperature sulfoselenization devices, suggesting that the variable-temperature sulfoselenization process can mitigate the band tail state mainly due to the improvement of the Cu–Zn order level. A low Eu value is essential for achieving high efficiency, and the 2H-14 device had the smallest Eu (32.86 meV), thus demonstrating the highest efficiency of 11.11%.
The ideality factor (A) and the reverse saturation current density (J0) of the five devices based on different annealing processes were calculated from the J–V data according to the method reported in the literature and the results are shown in Table 2. The 2H-14 device presented the smallest A value of 1.68 and J0 of 3.31 × 10−7 A cm−2 among all the devices, indicating that a proper variable-temperature sulfoselenization process can significantly decrease both A and J0 compared with constant-temperature sulfoselenization, thus revealing the much lower recombination in both the depletion region and absorber bulk due to the improvement in the crystal quality and interface of the absorber layer.
The statistical photovoltaic parameters of CZTSSe devices from different annealing processes are shown in Fig. 9. The four parameters were the lowest and more dispersed for the 510 °C-14 devices. The FF values of the variable-temperature sulfoselenization devices were significantly increased and relatively concentrated. The average PCE values for the 510-14, 570-14 1H-14, 2H-14, and 3H-14 devices were 8.43%, 8.9%, 10.2%, 10.9%, and 10.1%, respectively, indicating that device performance based on the 2H-14 process was reproducible and the best.

The present study upgraded the sulfoselenization process from the traditional constant-temperature sulfoselenization to a variable-temperature sulfoselenization. Specifically, high-temperature to low-temperature, then back to high-temperature variation annealing processes were adopted to synergistically promote crystal growth and avoid quick grain transition maturity and small grains. Furthermore, different variable-temperature sulfoselenization processes were developed. Through XRD and Raman characterization, it was found that a pure CZTSSe film with good crystallinity and better crystal quality could be prepared by a proper variable-temperature sulfoselenization process of 2H-14. Meanwhile, the results from SEM and EDS analysis confirmed that a copper-poor and zinc-rich CZTSSe film with a compact and flat surface, large grains spanning the whole layer thickness, and element composition distributed evenly could also be obtained by an appropriate variable-temperature sulfoselenization process of 2H-14. Compared with the highest efficiency of 9.10% of CZTSSe film solar cells based on stable-temperature sulfoselenization annealing processes, the best efficiency of CZTSSe devices could be improved to 11.11% by an optimized variable-temperature sulfoselenization process of 2H-14. These results show that the variable-temperature sulfoselenization growth process can improve the crystal quality and the corresponding efficiency of CZTSSe film solar cells. It is worth emphasizing that this work provides a new idea for further adjusting the sulfoselenization temperature during the CZTSSe crystal growth process and a new guiding direction for further improving the crystal quality and efficiency.
