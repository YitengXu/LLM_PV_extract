Three new alternating polymers with the electron-deficient isoindigo group as the acceptor unit and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) or BDT flanked by thiophenes (or octylthiophenes) as the donor unit were designed and synthesized. All the polymers have good thermal stability, solubility and broad absorption spectra. Their photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic (PV) properties were investigated. To understand their different PV performance in the resulting polymer solar cells (PSCs), the morphology of their blends with fullerene derivatives was investigated by atomic force microscopy, and the molecular geometries as well as the molecular frontier orbitals were simulated by density functional theory calculations (Gaussian 09). The polymer PBDT-TIT, with BDT flanked by thiophenes as the donor unit and isoindigo as the acceptor unit, exhibits quite planar backbones and its blend with fullerene derivatives shows optimal morphology. As a result, the PSCs based on PBDT-TIT with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-TIT:PC61BM/LiF/Al showed a power conversion efficiency of 4.22%, with a short-circuit current density of 7.87 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V and a fill factor of 0.68 under the AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator.


Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently received considerable attention in both academia and industry owing to their potential advantages of fabrication on flexible and light weight substrates by roll-to-roll solution processing, providing cost-effective production and reduced environment impact. The current state-of-the-art PSCs are often constructed based on the concept of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ), which contains a blend of a photo-absorbing polymer as electron donor and a fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) acting as electron acceptor to reach efficient exciton dissociation. The past decade has witnessed the great progress of PSCs with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 7%. The main contribution came from the development of new low band gap polymers and the optimization of device fabrication. From extensive literature, the common design rules for an efficient p-type polymer can be generalized, which include (i) well matched energy level offsets between polymers and fullerene derivatives to ensure enough driving force for charge separation while maintaining high open-circuit voltage (Voc), (ii) appropriate solubility and miscibility to achieve an optimal nanostructure in the active layers, and (iii) a narrow optical band gap (1.3–1.9 eV) and a high extinction coefficient to harvest more solar photons from a thin active layer. An efficient way to develop low band gap polymer is to combine electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) moieties as repeating units, forming internal donor–acceptor (D–A) structures. In this case, the photophysical and optoelectronics properties can be tuned conveniently by choosing different donor and acceptor moieties. For this purpose, plenty of electron-rich units, such as fluorene,silafluorene,2,7-carbazole,indolo[3,2-b]carbazole,cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene,dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole,indacenodithiophene,thieno[3,4-b]thiophene, and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), have been investigated. Yet, only a limited number of electron-deficient units, such as, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,quinoxaline,diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP), and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), work well in the resulting PSCs.

As a strong electron-deficient compound that appears red in color, isoindigo has been used in the dye industry for a long time. Yet, the application of isoindigo in organic solar cells was first introduced by the Reynolds group only in 2010. Recently, we have reported a low band gap polymer P3TI based on the new electron-deficient unit—isoindigo, with a high efficiency of 6.3%. This result demonstrated the promising potential of the isoindigo group as an electron-deficient unit for building D–A type of polymers toward high efficient PSCs. However, several parallel works about isoindigo-based polymers showed only limited efficiencies below 2%. The dramatically different PV performances from isoindigo-based polymers motivated us to investigate the relationship between the chemical structures of the isoindigo-based polymers and their PV properties. For this purpose, we designed and synthesized three polymers with BDT, BDT flanked by thiophenes and BDT flanked by octylthiophene units as electron-rich moieties, respectively, and isoindigo as the common electron-deficient units. Their photophysical, electrochemical and PV properties were investigated and compared. With optimal morphology in active layers indicated by atomic force microscopic (AFM) images and favorable molecular geometries proposed by theoretical calculations, the polymer PBDT-TIT showed the best PV performance with a PCE of 4.22%.

The synthetic routes for the monomers and the polymers are shown in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. The monomers 1 and 5 are previously synthesized in our lab. Compound 1 and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane were coupled by Stille reaction to yield 2. The bromination of 2 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) suffered a problem to afford 4. The selectivity of the bromination is not ideal and it was found that monobromo, dibromo and tribromo compounds were formed almost at the same time. An extensive and long column has to be used to separate the mixture, resulting in a low yield of 4. The possible reason for the low selectivity is the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the isoindigo group, which reduced the electron cloud density of the 5,5′-position of 2. The reduced electron density of 5,5′-position is not favorable for electrophilic attack, and makes the 4,4′-position susceptible to be brominated. To verify our hypothesis, the 4,4′-position was substituted by octyl to offer compound 3 and then the monomer 5 was obtained easily by the bromination of 3 with NBS. The polymers were prepared by using the corresponding monomers via the Stille coupling reaction. The reaction solution was precipitated into acetone and then the polymer was collected. After that, it was Soxhlet extracted by using acetone, diethyl ether and finally chloroform. The chloroform solution was purified by passing through a short silica gel column, and then precipitated into acetone. The final products were collected and dried under vacuum. The molecular weights of the three polymers were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) relative to monodisperse polystyrene standards. PDBT-I achieved a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 33000 with a fairly large polydispersity index (PDI) of 5.1. PDBT-OIO with octyl substituted on thiophene units exhibited enhanced solubility, resulting in a higher Mn of 90000 with a PDI of 2.7 as compared to PDBT-TIT without octyl substitution (Mn = 42000, PDI = 2.6).


The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the three polymers both in chloroform (CF) solution and in the solid state are shown in Fig. 1. The relative photophysical parameters are listed in Table 1. All polymers exhibit two main absorption bands with vibrational shoulders. In CF solution, the peak positions of the low-energy bands center at 685 nm, 660 nm and 635 nm for PBDT-I, PBDT-TIT and PBDT-OIO, respectively, and the high-energy bands for them peak at 450 nm, 435 nm and 425 nm, respectively. The high-energy bands can be assigned to the π–π* transition and the low-energy bands originate from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor units. The strong electron-withdrawing character of isoindigo moieties and the effective ICT result in the higher intensity of the low-energy absorption bands. It is noted that there is only slight difference in the absorption spectra of all the polymers when going from solution to the solid state. Similar phenomena were observed for other isoindigo-based polymers. This means either aggregation formed in solution or there are no strong aggregations and π–π stacking occurred in the solid state. To gain more insight into the reasons, we measured the absorption spectra of the three polymers in o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) solution both at room temperature and high temperature. We found that there is almost no difference can be observed, which indicates that there is no obvious aggregation formed in solution. The bulky branched side chains on the polymer backbones prevent strong aggregation in the solid state, leading to only small change in absorption spectra in going from solution to the solid state. To investigate the influence of the donor units on the absorption coefficients of the related polymers, the absorption coefficients were measured in films. As shown in Fig. 2, the absorption coefficients of PBDT-TIT and PBDT-OIO are higher than those of PBDT-I, which might be attributed to the extended conjugation length of the donor units in PBDT-TIT and PBDT-OIO. In this case, both π–π* transition and ICT effect were enhanced by the extended conjugation length of the donor units, which may provide a facile way to increase the absorption coefficients of D–A type of polymers. The optical band gaps (Eg) estimated from the onset of their absorption spectra in the solid state are 1.58 eV, 1.59 eV, and 1.61 eV for PBDT-I, PBDT-TIT, and PBDT-OIO, respectively, which are in the ideal band gap range for donor polymers.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the polymers are key parameters in determining the performance of the resulting PSCs. The offset between LUMO of polymers and LUMO of fullerene derivatives can affect the driving force for charge transfer and the difference between HOMO of polymers and LUMO of fullerene derivatives is definitive for Voc of the resulting PSCs. The HOMO and LUMO positions of polymers can be estimated from the oxidation (Eox) and reduction potentials (Ered) obtained in electrochemical measurements. In this study, the peak values from square-wave voltammetry (SWV) are used to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials of the polymers. The HOMO and LUMO levels are calculated according to the formula HOMO = −(Eox + 5.13) eV and LUMO = −(Ered + 5.13) eV, by setting the oxidative peak potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) to 0.63 V and the NHE energy level relative to vacuum to 4.5 eV. The square-wave voltammograms of the three polymers are shown in Fig. 3. For comparison, PC61BM and PC71BM were also measured under the same conditions and included in Fig. 3. The electrochemical parameters and calculated HOMO/LUMO levels of the polymers and PCBM are listed in Table 1. PBDT-I and PBDT-TIT show clear oxidation peaks at 0.69 V and 0.65 V, respectively. As a shoulder can be observed from the oxidation process of PBDT-OIO, its oxidation potential was deduced from the shoulder to 0.61 V. Similarly, the reduction potential of PBDT-TIT was also deduced from the shoulder observed in its reduction process. As shown in Table 1, the LUMO levels of the three polymers are very close,which is because the LUMO levels of D–A type of polymers were governed by the electron-deficient units. The HOMO levels of the three polymers show visible difference, which indicates that the Voc of the resulting PSCs will be different. The reduction potentials of PC61BM and PC71BM are shown in Fig. 3 and their corresponding LUMO levels are determined to be −4.03 eV and −4.13 eV, respectively. The small offset between the LUMO of the three polymers and the LUMO of PCBM indicates that there is only a very small driving force for the charge transfer to occur at the polymer/acceptor interfaces.


The PV performance of the three polymers was investigated with the conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. Noted that PC61BM and PC71BM have difference in solubility, miscibility with polymers and absorption properties. To investigate the influence of these differences on the PV performance of the resulting PSCs, both PC61BM and PC71BM as the electron acceptor were tested, respectively. The weight ratios of polymer:PCBM and the thicknesses of the active layers were optimized. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves obtained from the optimized solar cells based on these three polymers with PC61BM and PC71BM as the acceptor, respectively, are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The corresponding key parameters of the solar cells are listed in Table 2. The optimized donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio was found to be 1:1.5 for PC61BM-based solar cells while 1:2 was found to be optimal for solar cells based on PC71BM. In previous investigation, we noted that the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a processing additive is crucial for achieving an optimal morphology in an active layer that contained isoindigo-based polymers. Here, all the active layers were processed from 2.5% (v/v) DIO in oDCB. It can be found that PBDT-I and PBDT-OIO exhibit better PV performance when PC71BM was used as the acceptor instead of PC61BM. This improvement was also observed in many other polymers and the reason can be ascribed to the contribution of the considerably higher absorption intensity of PC71BM in the visible region, which can lead to the improvement in short-circuit current density (Jsc). The contribution in photocurrent from the PC71BM absorption is corroborated by their external quantum efficiency (EQE) profiles shown in Fig. 5. The quantum efficiency in the region where PC71BM absorbs (400–500 nm) is enhanced by using PC71BM instead of PC61BM. However, an opposite result was observed from the solar cells based on PBDT-TIT. Solar cells based on PBDT-TIT:PC61BM (1:1.5) exhibit the best PV performance with a PCE of 4.22%, Jsc of 7.87 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.79 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.68. The overall performance now in this case is much better than that from the solar cells based on PBDT-TIT:PC71BM (PCE of 3.16%). Morphology of active layers is known to be important for the device performance: phase separation between polymers and PCBM in proper size (10–20 nm) can provide large enough D/A interfaces for exciton dissociation. To better understand the reasons for the different PV performances, the morphologies of the active layers were investigated by tapping-mode AFM. The topographic images given in Fig. 6 show that the film containing PBDT-TIT:PC61BM (Fig. 6(b)) has a much finer morphology and smaller domain size as compared to that of PBDT-TIT:PC71BM (Fig. 6(e)). Thus, the lower PV performance of PBDT-TIT:PC71BM based solar cells can be ascribed to the non-optimal morphology of the active layer. While regarding to PBDT-I and PBDT-OIO, there is no obvious difference in the morphology after replacing PC61BM by PC71BM (see Fig. 6), which confirms that the improvement in Jsc obtained from the solar cells based on PBDT-I or PBDT-OIO with PC71BM is mainly due to the improved absorption in the active layers. This indicates that the morphology of the active layer and the contribution of the enhanced absorption from the acceptor material in the active layer need to be balanced in order to achieve a high photovoltaic performance. PBDT-I presents a slightly lower efficiency of 1.53% as compared to a similar polymer PBDT-ID (1.91%) reported by Zhang et al. But a quite large difference in Voc (0.84 V in this work and 0.71 V in the literature) was observed, which might be attributed to the difference in the side chains on isoindigo groups of the two polymers (2-hexyldecyl in this work and 2-octyldodecyl in the literature). Similar phenomena were also noted in previous reports. This corroborated the importance of the choice of solubilizing side chains for polymers, which can have distinct influence on Voc and in turn on the PV performance of the resulting PSCs.

The electrochemical measurements indicate that the LUMO offsets between the three polymers and PCBM are about 0.1–0.3 eV, which is smaller than the empirically suggested LUMO offset (0.3–0.4 eV) for an efficient exciton dissociation. It is thus interesting to investigate if the efficient exciton dissociation can occur in our polymer/PCBM material systems. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra obtained from the films based on the three polymers and their blends with PC61BM were recorded and shown in Fig. 7. The PL of PBDT-TIT and PBDT-OIO could be quenched more efficiently by PC61BM as compared to that of PBDT-I, indicating less efficient exciton dissociation occurred in the blend of PBDT-I:PC61BM. The incomplete PL quenching is partially responsible for the low performance of PBDT-I based PSCs.

In order to further understand the PV performance and electronic properties of the three polymers, the molecular geometries and the electron density of states distribution of the three polymers were simulated by using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 with a hybrid B3LYP correlation functional and a split valence 6-31G* basis set. Oligomers containing two repeating units were taken as a model for calculations and methyl was used instead of long side chains. The optimized molecular geometries of the models and their calculated LUMO and HOMO frontier orbitals are depicted in Table 3. The HOMO wave function is delocalized over the whole polymer backbones, and the LUMO wave function is localized on the isoindigo groups, indicating the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the isoindigo group because of its two lactam rings. The distributions of LUMO and HOMO frontier orbitals also propose that there is an effective intramolecular charge transfer occurring, which is consistent with the observed strong low-energy absorption band in Fig. 1. From the side view of the molecular geometries, it was clearly observed that the backbones of PBDT-TIT are highly coplanar but the other two polymers are more twisted. The dihedral angle between thiophene and BDT is 10.6° for PBDT-TIT, which is smaller than that in PBDT-OIO (23.1°). The reason could be attributed to the steric hindrance caused by the methyl side chain on thiophene units. The high coplanarity of the backbones of PBDT-TIT is beneficial for π–π stacking of their backbones in the solid state and charge transfer, which is consistent with the higher PV performance of PBDT-TIT based solar cells. The insertion of thiophene spacers between BDT and isoindigo groups leads to more planar backbones of the resulting polymer and better nanoscale morphology in the related blends, resulting in an improved PV performance. This motif is anticipated to be used in the design of other D–A type of polymers.

To explore the applications of the new electron-deficient unit—isoindigo in PSCs, three new isoindigo-based polymers were designed and synthesized. It was found that when thiophene units were inserted as a spacer group between BDT and isoindigo units, the resulting polymer (PBDT-TIT) was much more planar than the one without thiophene spacer units (PBDT-I). On the other hand, the introduction of octyl group on thiophene units increased the solubility and molecular weight of the resulting polymer (PBDT-OIO), in parallel with a reduced planarity of the polymer backbones led to poor PV performance. Benefit from the optimized molecular geometries of PBDT-TIT indicated by DFT calculations and the optimal nanostructure of the active layers, PSCs based on PBDT-TIT as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor exhibited a decent PCE of up to 4.22%. This study is anticipated to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the structures and properties of isoindigo-based polymers and further improvement in PCE can be expected.



1H NMR (500 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were acquired from a Varian Inova 500 MHz and 400 MHz NMR spectrometer, respectively. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal reference with deuterated chloroform as solvent. MALDI-TOF was recorded on a Bruker Autoflex I. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on a Waters Alliance GPCV2000 with a refractive index detector. Columns: Waters Styvagel HT GE × 1, Waters Styvagel HMW GE × 2. The eluent was 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The working temperature was 135 °C and the resolution time was 2 h. The concentration of the samples was 0.5 mg mL−1, which were filtered (filter: 0.45 μm) prior to the analysis. The molecular weights were calculated relative to calibration with polystyrene standards. The film samples for measuring UV-vis and PL were spin-cast from oDCB solutions with 2.5% DIO by volume on cleaned glass substrates. PL spectra were obtained by an Andor spectrometer (Shamrock sr-303i-B, coupled to a Newton EMCCD detector) and the pumping light source is a red CW He–Ne 632 nm laser with an intensity of 2 mW cm−2. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 or a 950 UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrometer. Transmittance and reflectance spectra of thin films were obtained from the integrating sphere of the spectrophotometer (Lambda 950) and the thicknesses of the films for the calculation of the absorption coefficient were recorded by a surface profilometer, Dektak 6M. The absorption coefficient for the films was calculated according to the Beer–Lambert law. The topographic images of the active layers were taken by using AFM from a Dimension 3100 system (Digital Instruments/Veeco) operating in tapping mode.


All reagents and starting materials were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (6) was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. (E)-6,6′-Dibromo-1,1′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-2,2′-dione (1) and (E)-6,6′-bis(5-bromo-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)-1,1′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-2,2′-dione (5) were prepared according to the literature methods.


To the solution of compound 1 (2.75 g, 3.15 mmol) and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (2.60 g, 6.96 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, 50 mL) bubbled with nitrogen, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) (15 mg) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3) (30 mg) were added in one portion. The mixture was stirred overnight at 80 °C under nitrogen. Then the mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into water. The organic phase was extracted by diethyl ether, and then washed with water, dried over MgSO4. After the removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the solids were purified by silica chromatography with dichloromethane:hexane = 1:2 as the eluent to afford compound 2 (2.55 g, 92.5%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 9.19 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.43 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 2H), 7.37 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 2H), 7.32 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.16–7.11 (m, 2H), 7.00 (s, 2H), 3.72 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 4H), 1.95 (m, 2H), 1.46–1.19 (br, 48H), 0.89–0.83 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 168.57, 145.68, 144.13, 137.70, 131.97, 130.20, 128.28, 126.00, 124.15, 121.02, 119.26, 105.06, 44.44, 36.36, 31.88, 31.84, 31.76, 31.74, 29.99, 29.66, 29.59, 29.29, 26.62, 26.60, 22.66, 22.63, 14.10, 14.08. MALDI-TOF MS (M = 875.4): m/z = 874.1 [M+].


To a solution of compound 2 in 50 mL THF, NBS (1.12 g, 6.3 mmol) was added in several portions in 1 h in the dark. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then it was poured into water and extracted with diethyl ether. Removal of the solvent and column purification on silica gel using dichloromethane/hexane (1/2) offered the target compound 4 in low yield. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 9.18 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.20 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.16 (d, J = 3.9 Hz, 2H), 7.08 (d, J = 3.9 Hz, 2H), 6.88 (s, 2H), 3.70 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 4H), 1.92 (m, 2H), 1.45–1.16 (br, 48H), 0.89–0.83 (br, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 168.44, 145.79, 145.44, 136.81, 132.00, 131.13, 130.37, 124.27, 121.29, 118.84, 112.99, 104.62, 44.47, 36.35, 31.87, 31.86, 31.74, 31.73, 29.99, 29.67, 29.59, 29.30, 26.59, 22.66, 22.64, 14.10, 14.09. MALDI-TOF MS (M = 1033.1): m/z = 1031.9 [M+].


In a 25 mL dry flask, 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (6) (148 mg, 0.19 mmol), compound 1 (167 mg, 0.19 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (5 mg) and P(o-tol)3 (10 mg) were dissolved in degassed toluene (5 mL). The mixture was vigorously stirred at 100 °C under nitrogen for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was poured into acetone. The polymer was collected by filtration through a 0.45 μm Teflon filter. And then the polymer was washed in a Soxhlet extractor with acetone and diethyl ether for 24 h each. After that, the polymer was Soxhlet extracted with chloroform. The chloroform fraction was purified by passing through a short silica gel column and then precipitated from acetone. Finally, the polymer was collected by filtration through the 0.45 μm Teflon filter and dried under vacuum at 40 °C overnight (122 mg, 55%).


PBDT-TIT and PBDT-OIO were synthesized according to the same procedure as PBDT-I with the respective monomers. The reaction time for PBDT-TIT and PBDT-OIO is 1 h and 3 h, respectively.


Square-wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were carried out on a CH-Instruments 650A Electrochemical Workstation. A three-electrode setup was used with platinum wires both as working electrode and counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ was used as reference electrode calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenyl couple (Fc/Fc+). A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile was used as supporting electrolyte. The polymer was deposited onto the working electrode from chloroform solution. In order to remove oxygen from the electrolyte, the system was bubbled with nitrogen prior to each experiment. The nitrogen inlet was then moved to above the liquid surface and left there during the scans. HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated from peak potentials of the third scan by setting the oxidative peak potential of Fc/Fc+vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) to 0.63 V, and the NHEvs. the vacuum level to 4.5 V. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated according to the formula HOMO = −(Eox + 5.13) eV and LUMO = −(Ered + 5.13) eV, where Eox and Ered were determined from oxidation and reduction peaks respectively.


All the solar cell devices were fabricated using the following configuration: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PCBM/LiF (0.6 nm)/Al (80 nm). Indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass substrates were cleaned by detergent and acetone firstly, and then TL-1 (NH3:H2O2:H2O = 1:1:5) procedure for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO-glass at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS were dried at 120 °C for 20 min in atmosphere and then transferred into the glove box filled with N2. Then the oDCB solution (with 2.5% DIO by volume) of PCBM and polymers was spin-cast on the surface of PEDOT:PSS. In this paper, the total concentration of all the active solutions was 30 mg mL−1. After coating the active layers, the substrates were transferred into the evaporation chamber. Then 0.6 nm LiF and 80 nm Al were evaporated on the active layer through a shadow mask under 4 × 10−6 mbar. The accurate area of every device (4–6 mm2), defined by the overlapping area between ITO and metal electrode, was measured carefully by an optical microscope. The J–V curves of solar cells were recorded from a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under the AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (Model SS-50A, Photo Emission Tech., Inc.). EQE spectra were characterized using a Keithley 485 picoammeter under illumination of monochromatic light through the ITO side of devices. Thicknesses of the active layers were recorded by a surface profiler, Dektak 6M.
