A series of new two-dimensional copolymers, PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, with conjugated benzodiathiazole (BT) or naphthobisthiadiazole (NT) side chains were successfully synthesized and characterized for high performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). The NT unit showed a stronger electron-withdrawing ability and a larger conjugation than the BT unit, which induced a stronger ICT process between the benzodithiophene (BDT)-thiophene (T) backbone and the conjugated side chain for NT containing copolymers. As a result, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT showed lower-lying bandgaps and more red-shifted absorption than PBDTT-TABT. The alkylthio modification effect of conjugated side chains was also investigated in this work. This effect showed a positive role in lowering the HOMO energy level, and a negative role in elevating carrier mobility and molecular stacking properties in our two-dimensional polymeric systems. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs were fabricated using these copolymers as the donor materials to evaluate their photovoltaic properties. The PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT devices exhibited PCEs of 4.60%, 5.65% and 4.01%, respectively. In spite of the Voc values, the highest Jsc, FF and PCE were achieved for the PBDTT-TANT device, which was attributed to its red-shifted absorption, improved carrier mobility and well-defined phase separation. It is interesting that the Jscs, FFs and PCEs of all these devices were elevated significantly when made using the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) method. The THF–SVA process would provide a driving force to facilitate the formation of a much more well-defined surface morphology, resulting in the enhanced Jsc and FF values. The PBDTT-TANT device showed the highest PCE of 8.04%, which is the top efficiency for this type of two-dimensional copolymer with donor (D)–donor (D) polymer backbones and donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated side chains. Our design strategy would give an instructive guide to developing high performance two-dimensional polymer donors to be used in organic photovoltaic applications.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in the field of photovoltaics because of their potential advantages of low cost, low weight, flexible fabrication and low-temperature solution processing technique. To improve their power conversion efficiency (PCE), significant efforts have been devoted to increasing their open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). Since the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture was introduced into PSCs, the PCE promptly increased in the past few years from 1% to 10% by designing polymer structures and optimizing device fabrication technologies. Commonly, the active layer of BHJ PSCs contains a phase-separated blend of a donor (D) material and an acceptor (A) material. In most cases, fullerene derivatives were chosen as the acceptor material, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), which showed relatively weak light-harvesting ability in the visible light range. Because most of the solar flux will be harvested by the donor materials, research efforts on developing new conjugated polymer donors are still the main focus in this field.

Most of the successful polymer donors in PSCs featured a linear and rigid main chain system with flexible side chains. At the same time, two-dimensional conjugated polymers with conjugated side chains had always been the primary interest of academia. The conjugated side chains would extend the conjugation of the polymer donors, thereby improving the absorption, charge transport, and the device performance. In addition, the extended conjugation could also facilely adjust the energy levels of the pristine copolymers via different conjugated bridges, and enhance the miscibility with fullerene acceptors in BHJ device fabrication. So far, two-dimensional polymer donors usually possess some kind of typical polymeric backbone, such as donor (D), donor–donor (D–D), or donor–acceptor (D–A) main chain structures. Li et al. first designed and synthesized a series of two-dimensional polymer donors using polythiophenes (PT) as the backbone and variable conjugated side chains of bi(phenylenevinylene), bi(thienylenevinylene), and phenothiazinevinylene, exhibiting broadened absorption spectra, two-dimensional charge–transport properties, and enhanced device performance. Hou et al. first attached two thiophene-conjugated side chains to the skeleton of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), and synthesized a two-dimensional polymer donor with a D–A polymeric backbone. This strategy has already been employed to construct high-performance polymer donor materials in PSCs. Tan et al. reported a two-dimensional BDT-T copolymer with a D–D polymeric backbone, PTG1, containing 4,7-dithien-5-yl-2,1,3-benzodiathiazole (DTBT) as the conjugated side chains. PTG1 showed a high hole mobility and a moderate PCE of 4.32%. In order to reduce the bandgap and enhance the absorbance of this type of polymer donor based on BDT-T backbones, an isoindigo (ID) unit was introduced instead of a benzodiathiazole (BT) unit to develop a new copolymer PBDT-TID, leading to an enhanced PCE of 6.51% in an inverted device. Recently, Li et al. used fluorine substituted BT, instead of BT, to decrease the HOMO energy level and increase the interchain interaction of PTG1, and synthesized a two-dimensional polymer of P(BDT-TBTF). P(BDT-TBTF) exhibited an elevated PCE of 6.21% compared to PTG1.
In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of new two-dimensional BDT-T copolymers, PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, with conjugated BT or naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) side chains (Fig. 1). As is known for acceptor moieties, an NT unit is made up of two 1,2,5-thiadiazole rings fused in the skeleton of central naphthalene, which possesses a larger planarity and a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than that of a BT unit. The introduction of NT instead of BT would be expected to reduce the bandgap and extend the absorption of the resulting BDT-T copolymers. On the other hand, alkylthio modification has been proven to be an effective approach to further lower the HOMO energy level and elevate the device performance of BDT-based copolymers in PSCs. Thus, the alkylthio modified thiophene side chains were also introduced on the skeleton of BDT for comparison in this work. As expected, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT with the NT side chains showed an enhanced absorption compared to PBDTT-TABT with the BT side chains. However, PBDTT-TABT exhibited a lower HOMO energy level than those of the other two polymers. Overall, PBDTT-TANT with the alkyl modified thiophene side chains showed the best PCE of 8.04% compared to its conventional PSCs after the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment. The design strategy and results in this work would give an instructive guide in developing high performance two-dimensional polymer donors for organic photovoltaic applications.

4,8-Di(2,3-didecylthiophen-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (10) (1.91 g, 2.37 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL of anhydrous THF under the protection of argon. The solution was then cooled to 0 °C, and a solution of n-BuLi (2.37 mL, 5.92 mmol, 2.5 M in hexane) was added dropwise slowly with stirring. After the addition was finished, the reaction mixture was warmed to ambient temperature and stirred for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was subsequently cooled to 0 °C and Sn(n-Bu)3Cl (2.31 g, 7.11 mmol) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 30 minutes, and then warmed to room temperature for another 8 h. After that, the reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted twice with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer with dichloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The elemental analysis was performed on a Thermo Electron SPA Flash EA 1112 series analyzer. Molecular weights of the copolymers were determined by using a Waters 1515 GPC instrument with chloroform as the eluent and polystyrene as a standard. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted on a TA Instrument Model SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and under a N2 flow rate of 90 mL min−1. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Cary 300 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were made on a CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated 0.1 mol L−1 acetonitrile solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. The CHCl3 solutions of the polymers were drop-coated onto the platinum plate working electrodes. XRD patterns of the polymers were recorded on a Philips X-ray diffractometer operated in reflection geometry mode at 30 mA, 40 kV with Cu Kα radiation. AFM images were obtained by using a Bruker Inova atomic microscope in tapping mode. SCLC is described by J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where J is the current density, L is the film thickness of the active layer, μ is the hole or electron mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), V is the internal voltage in the device and V = Vappl − Vbi − Va, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the relative work function difference of the two electrodes and Va is the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes.


The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. A glass substrate with a pre-patterned ITO (sheet resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) was first ultrasonicated in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in turn, and then modified by UV-ozone treatment for 20 min. After filtration through a 0.45 μm filter, PEDOT:PSS (Bay P VP AI 4083, Bayer AG) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s to form a thin layer of 35 nm thickness on the cleaned ITO substrate, and baked on a hot plate at 140 °C for about 15 min. A blend film of copolymer:PC71BM (1:4 w/w) was prepared by spin-coating its mixed solvent of chlorobenzene (CB)/1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) (97:3, v:v) solution (concentration: 28 mg mL−1) at 1500 rpm. for 60 s. A Ca layer (15 nm) and an Al layer (140 nm) were finally deposited in sequence under a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 Torr to form the negative electrode. Hole-only devices were fabricated similarly to the PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:4)/MoO3/Ag. 10 nm MoO3 was evaporated onto the surface of the photoactive layer with or without surface modification before Al evaporation. All devices were fabricated in a nitrogen-filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). The thickness of the films was measured using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer. The device area was 0.04 cm2. The I–V characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measurement system. The EQE values were tested with a Newport Model 77890 (Newport Co. Ltd.) during illumination with monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. A solar simulator was used as the light source, and the light intensity was monitored by using a standard Si solar cell. All fabrication and characterization processes, except for the EQE measurements, were conducted in a glove box.


The synthetic routes to the monomers and the two-dimensional copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. The compounds 6a–6c were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction of the thienyltin derivatives (4a or 4b) and the BT or NT based dibromides (5a or 5b). The bromo site of 6a–6c was terminated with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene by the Stille coupling reaction again to afford compounds 7a–7c. Using a Vilsmeier reaction, compounds 8a–8c were synthesized through formylation of the 2-position of the thiophene unit in compounds 7a–7c. After that, 8a–8c were reacted with (2,5-dibromothiophen-3-yl-methyl) phosphonic acid diethyl ester to give monomers 9a–9c, using a Wittig–Horner reaction. Finally, the two-dimensional copolymers, PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, were prepared in good yields by a Stille coupling polymerization using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst system. The molecular structures of the intermediates and the copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. All the copolymers show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. The molecular weights (Mw and Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of the copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with a polystyrene standard calibration. PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT have comparable number-average molecular weights (Mn) with 15.9 kDa and 13.5 kDa, respectively. However, PBDTT-TABT exhibits relatively higher Mn of 27.0 KDa, which might be attributed to the decreased steric hindrance of the dibromothiophene monomer (9a) with the BT containing side chain. The thermal stabilities of the copolymers were evaluated by thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. As shown in Fig. 2a, the decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT were measured to be 416 °C, 416 °C and 360 °C, respectively. The results indicated that using NT instead of BT could not significantly increase the thermal properties of BDT-T based copolymers while the alkylthio flexile side chains would reduce the thermal stability of the resulting copolymers compared to the alkyl side chains. In any event, the thermal stability of the three copolymers is good enough for their device fabrications and evaluations. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT are also shown in Fig. 2b. No glass transition was observed for any of these copolymers in their DSC heating and cooling traces in the range of room temperature to 200 °C. The molecular weights and the thermal analysis data are listed in Table 1.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two-dimensional copolymers in chloroform solution and as thin films are shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding absorption data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3a, these copolymers show two distinct absorption characteristics in solution. The absorption band in the high energy region is due to π–π* transition in the polymer backbones, and the other in the lower energy region comes from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor units of the main chains and the acceptor units of the side chains. The low-energy peaks of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT in CHCl3 were located at about 490 nm, 492 nm and 495 nm, respectively. PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT with the NT side chains show red-shifted absorption in contrast to that of PBDTT-TABT with the BT side chains. The reason is attributed to the boosted ICT properties, originating from the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the NT unit. Compared with PBDTT-TANT, the absorption is red-shifted for PBDTT-TSNT in solution. This is probably attributed to the introduced alkylthio moiety showing an electron-donating ability, which can increase the ICT effect between the main chain and the side chain to a certain extent. As shown in Fig. 3b, similar behavior was observed from the absorption spectra of these copolymers as thin solid films. Relative to their counterparts in the solution state, the absorption shapes became broader in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm, and the peaks showed slight red-shifts for all the three copolymers. The reason could be explained by the enhanced aggregation and strengthened interchain interactions between the conjugated backbones in the solid state, which could facilitate charge transportation in PSCs. The optical bandgaps of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT were determined from the absorption onsets of the corresponding copolymer films to be 1.98 eV, 1.87 eV and 1.85 eV, respectively. PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT showed smaller bandgaps than that of PBDTT-TANT, which was ascribed to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the NT unit, generating an enhanced ICT effect between the main chain and the side chain. The smallest bandgap of PBDTT-TANT would be expected to harvest more sunlight, increasing the Jsc value in its PSCs.

The energy levels are important parameters to guide selection of appropriate acceptors in BHJ PSCs. Thus, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the redox behaviors of the copolymers and determine their energy levels. The CV experiments were performed in a three-electrode cell, using 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4) as the supporting electrolyte in anhydrous acetonitrile. A platinum plate coated with a thin film of the studied copolymer, a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as the work, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ system to be 4.34 eV using the previous methods. As shown in Fig. 4a, the onset oxidation potentials of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT were located at 1.11 V, 1.03 V and 1.07 V, leading to the corresponding HOMO levels of −5.45 eV, −5.37 eV and −5.41 eV, respectively. The low-lying HOMO levels of these copolymers implied their enhanced chemical stability in ambient conditions. Furthermore, the lower HOMO energy levels could be helpful to obtain the relatively high Vocs of their PSCs because Voc is proportional to the energy level difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. Compared to PBDTT-TANT, PBDTT-TSNT showed a lower HOMO energy level, which could be attributed to the effect of alkylthio modification. On the other hand, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT were calculated to be −3.31 eV, −3.39 eV and −3.44 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the LUMO gaps of 0.56–0.69 eV between the copolymers and PC71BM would afford an enough driving force to facilitate an efficient exciton dissociation at the D–A interface, thereby ensuring energetically favorable electron transfer to overcome the binding energy of the intrachain exciton. The corresponding electrochemical data of these copolymers are summarized in Table 2.


To evaluate the side chain effect on the molecular architectures and the electronic properties of the resulting copolymers, Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations were performed on the model monomers with three repeated donor–acceptor units to verify stationary points as stable states for the optimized conformations and single-point energies, at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. To simplify the calculations, long alkyl chains were replaced by the methyl group because they did not significantly affect the equilibrium geometries and electronic properties. The HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the model compounds are shown in Fig. 5. These copolymers show similar distributions for both the HOMO and LUMO. As shown in Fig. 5, the localization of the HOMO was distributed in the electron-rich skeleton of the polymer backbone while the LUMO was mainly located on the electron-deficient BT or NT containing side chains. Compared to the HOMOs, HOMO-1 orbitals moved from the middle part to the side parts even distributing on the side chains to some extent, which implied that internal charge transfer was possible in these two-dimensional conjugation systems. A similar transfer trend is observed from the LUMO to LUMO+1. The results indicated that the significant charge-transfer character occurred between the BDT-T main chains and the conjugated side chains, which was consistent with the observed strong low-energy absorption band in Fig. 3. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT trimers were calculated to be −4.86/−2.66 eV, −4.80/−2.91 eV and −4.83/−2.98 eV, respectively. The bandgaps were then determined to be 2.20, 1.89 and 1.85 eV. Obviously, the trend of the simulation results agreed well with those obtained from the CV and UV-vis measurements.


To gain insight into the molecular stacking of the two-dimensional copolymers, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured for PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT. As shown in Fig. 6, XRD patterns of these copolymers exhibited two types of diffraction peaks. In the small angle region, clear (100) peaks were located at 2θ of 4.00°, 3.73° and 3.82° for PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, corresponding to the lamellar packing with a d-spacing (dl00) of 22.06 Å, 23.66 Å and 23.10 Å. The second peaks (010) in the wide angle region reflected the π–π stacking distances between the polymer backbones, which were located at 2θ of 21.95°, 22.22° and 21.79° for PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance (d010) of 4.04 Å, 4.00 Å and 4.07 Å, respectively. Because the bulk size of the NT side chain is larger than that of the BT side chain, PBDTT-TANT possesses a longer lamellar packing distance than PBDTT-TABT. After introducing the alkythio group instead of the alkyl group, the flexibility of the alkyl chain would be increased, confirming the small decrease of lamellar packing distance obtained from the PBDTT-TSNT film. On the other hand, PBDTT-TANT shows a shorter π–π stacking distance than PBDTT-TABT, which can be attributed to the enhanced interaction of conjugated polymer chains by choosing the NT unit with a stronger electron-withdrawing ability. Surprisingly, after introducing an alkylthio unit instead of an alkyl unit, the π–π stacking distance of PBDTT-TSNT becomes larger even than PBDTT-TABT with the BT side chains. The result indicated that the effect of alkylthio modification via S–S interaction on the ordered molecular stacking would not work in this type of two-dimensional system, however, the positive influence of alkylthio modification is commonly observed in linear conjugated polymer donor materials. Through the comprehensive consideration of the above XRD results, PBDTT-TANT shows the best stacking properties, and can be expected to gain the highest carrier mobility in PSCs.


To study the photovoltaic properties of the resulting copolymers, PSCs with a device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated and evaluated. The active layers were spin-coated from a chlorobenzene (CB) solution of the donor and acceptor materials. The optimized condition of device fabrication was obtained by varying polymer:PC71BM weight ratios, active layer thicknesses, and solvent additives. The best photovoltaic properties were obtained with a blend ratio of 1:4 with 3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive for all three copolymer based PSCs. Fig. 7 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices. The related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 7a, the PBDTT-TABT:PC71BM device showed a PCE of 4.60%, with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 9.64 mA cm−2 and an FF of 47.5%, which was superior to that of the PSC device based on PTG1 with a similar molecular structure. Under the same conditions, the PBDTT-TANT device exhibited a higher PCE of 5.65% with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 10.00 mA cm−2 and an FF of 58.0%. But a decreased PCE of 4.01% with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 8.93 mA cm−2 and an FF of 45.3% was obtained for the PBDTT-TSNT device. Since the Voc is related to the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor energy offset, the obtained high Voc values of these devices should result from the low-lying HOMO levels of the polymer donors as determined in the CV measurements. The highest Voc value of 1.00 V from the PBDTT-TABT device could be due to its low HOMO level as compared to those of PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT. Except for the decreased Voc, the simultaneous improvements of Jsc and FF guaranteed achieving the highest PCE of 5.65% for the PBDTT-TANT device. The increased Jsc could be confirmed by EQE measurements. As shown in Fig. 7b, the EQE response of these devices covered a broad range from 300 to 750 nm, which corresponded to the absorptions of both the copolymer donor and the fullerene acceptor. The maximum EQE values in the range of 450–650 nm reached about 63%, 68% and 59% for the PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT devices, respectively. The EQE values are in good agreement with the Jsc values from J–V measurements.
Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) using some polar solvents before the deposition of the cathode is an effective strategy to optimize the performance of PSCs via the formation of a more favorable phase separation. Thus, we employed tetrahydrofuran (THF)–SVA to further improve the PCEs of the PSCs based on these two-dimensional copolymers. SVA treatment was performed in a glass Petri dish at room temperature in a glove box. A 30 mm Petri dish was first injected with about 2 mL THF and then closed for one minute to ensure the THF vapor saturated the whole chamber. Then the active film was transferred to the Petri dish and kept there for 30 s before it was removed. From Fig. 7a and Table 3, in comparison with the performance of the PSCs without SVA treatments, the PCEs of the three copolymer based PSCs increased greatly after the SVA process. The PCEs increased from 4.60% to 6.74% for the PBDTT-TABT device, from 5.65% to 8.04% for the PBDTT-TANT device, and from 4.01% to 6.00% for the PBDTT-TSNT device, respectively. All the PSCs showed an improvement of PCE values more than 40%, which indicated that the THF–SVA treatment was an effective method to optimize the photovoltaic property of this polymer donor system. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 8.04% is the highest value for this type of two-dimensional copolymer with D–D polymer backbones and D–A conjugated side chains. It is clear that the Vocs of these devices decreased a little after the SVA treatments, which is also observed in the previously reported work. Despite this, the Jsc and FF showed a significant improvement, giving rise to a large increase of PCEs for all the devices after SVA treatments. From Table 3, the Jsc values were improved from 9.64, 10.00 and 8.93 mA cm−2 to 11.12, 13.06 and 10.25 mA cm−2 for the PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT devices, respectively. The EQE spectra were also measured to verify the elevation of Jscs, which are plotted in Fig. 7b. The EQE values of all the devices after SVA treatments exhibited higher responses than those without the SVA treatment. The largest increase of the PBDTT-TANT device up to 78% supported its highest Jsc of 13.06 mA cm−2. The enhanced device performance after the SVA treatments, especially in Jsc and FF, is also confirmed by measuring the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh). In fact, a decrease in Rs and/or an increase in Rsh are essential to achieving high Jsc and FF. For all the devices after SVA treatments, the Rs and Rsh showed the same variation trends. Take the PBDTT-TANT device as an example, the Rs decreased from 16.0 Ω cm2 to 10.8 Ω cm2, while the Rsh increased from 549.6 Ω cm2 to 629.2 Ω cm2. The lowest Rs and the highest Rsh of the PBDTT-TANT device indicated that the best ohmic contact was achieved at the interfaces of the active layer/cathode, which is beneficial for charge transport and extraction.

To further understand the origin of the enhanced Jsc with the SVA treatments, hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM (1:4)/MoO3/Ag were fabricated in order to determine the hole mobilities of the three copolymer based blend films by a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The J–V curves of the hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 8, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 4. Without the SVA treatments, the hole mobilities were measured to be 2.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT blend films, respectively. The PBDTT-TANT blend film exhibited the highest hole mobility, which could be attributed to its best crystallinity and stacking property among these copolymers, as discussed in the XRD section. This also supports the highest Jsc value obtained for the PBDTT-TANT device. On the other hand, the PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT blend films with the SVA treatments exhibited relatively higher hole mobilities of 3.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In comparison with their counterparts without SVA treatments, the blend films showed 1.37, 1.34 and 1.64 fold increases for PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, respectively. Therefore, the THF–SVA treatment of active layers could effectively improve the carrier transport property, and thereby afford the higher Jsc values and PCEs of the related PSCs.

To investigate the phase separation of the active blend films and the SVA effect on the device performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the surface morphology of these blend layers. The AFM topography and phase images are shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, each polymer blend showed a different surface morphology with or without THF–SVA. Without the SVA treatment, all the three blend films had smooth surfaces with the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values of 0.80 nm, 0.60 nm and 0.79 nm for PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, indicating all of the copolymer donors have a good miscibility with PC71BM. After the THF–SVA treatment for 30 s, the blend films were more phase separated, featuring larger surface aggregates and more notable phase domains. The RMS values of the active layers increased to 1.63 nm, 1.08 nm and 1.76 nm for PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, respectively. The increased roughness values caused by the SVA treatments are similar to the results reported by other groups. Apparently, the THF–SVA process provided a driving force to facilitate domain growth, forming a more distinct bi-continuous network of the donor and acceptor-rich domains. The PBDTT-TANT based blend surface after the THF–SVA treatment exhibited the best interpenetrating networks with defined and distinct nanoscale phase separation, which was beneficial for charge transport, resulting in the high Jsc and FF of its PSCs.


In summary, a series of new two-dimensional BDT-T copolymers, PBDTT-TABT, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT, with conjugated BT or NT side chains were successfully synthesized and characterized for efficient PSCs. Compared with the BT unit, the NT unit has a stronger electron-withdrawing ability and an extended conjugation, which induced the stronger ICT effect between the polymeric backbone and the conjugated side chain for NT containing copolymers. Thus, PBDTT-TANT and PBDTT-TSNT showed lower bandgaps and more red-shifted absorption than those of PBDTT-TABT. The alkylthio modification effect of side chains was also investigated, and the results indicated that it showed a positive role in lowering the HOMO energy level while playing a negative role in elevating carrier mobility and molecular stacking property in this type of polymeric system. BHJ PSCs were fabricated with the three copolymers as the donor materials to evaluate their photovoltaic performance. These devices exhibited PCEs of 4.60% for PBDTT-TABT, 5.65% for PBDTT-TANT and 4.01% for PBDTT-TSNT, respectively. In spite of the Voc values, enhanced Jsc, FF and PCE were achieved for the PBDTT-TANT device, which was attributed to its red-shifted absorption, improved stacking property and well-defined phase separation of the related blend film. When using the THF–SVA treatment, the Jscs and FFs of all the devices were improved significantly, give rising to much higher PCEs. The THF–SVA process would provide a driving force to facilitate domain growth to form a more distinct bi-continuous network of the donor and acceptor-rich domains. The PBDTT-TANT device showed the highest PCE of 8.04%, which is the best efficiency for this type of two-dimensional copolymer with D–D polymer backbones and D–A conjugated side chains. Our design strategy would give an instructive guide in developing high performance two-dimensional polymer donors in PSCs.
