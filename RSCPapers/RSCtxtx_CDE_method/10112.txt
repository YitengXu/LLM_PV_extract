Perylene diimide (PDI), which features intense absorption, a low-lying energy level, and high electron mobility, is a promising building block for electron acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, this planar molecule has a strong tendency to form large aggregates during film formation which strongly limits its OSC performance. Herein, we report a new and simple PDI derivative, B(PDI)3, in which a central benzene unit is employed to connect three PDI arms. This compact arrangement of sterically bulky PDI moieties leads to a twisted molecular geometry of the resultant structure. This suppresses the strong crystallization tendency of PDI chromophores, owing to the broken molecular coplanarity and symmetry. Therefore, B(PDI)3 is applied as a non-fullerene acceptor in OSCs, providing a good power conversion efficiency of 5.65% when blended with the PTB7-Th donor.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) with efficiencies over 10% have been achieved by blending narrow band-gap polymers and small molecule donors with fullerene acceptors (e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM/PC71BM). However, further development of OSCs would require more efficient and low-cost materials. Fullerene derivatives are therefore considered to be replaced by new electron acceptors, since they are weak in absorption and expensive in purification. Developing new electron acceptors has become an important topic. OSCs using non-fullerene acceptors, including small molecule acceptors and polymer acceptors, have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5–11%. Among a number of non-fullerene acceptors developed so far, perylene diimide (PDI) is one of the attractive candidates because of its suitable absorption, energetics, and electron mobility. In addition, PDI, as a commercial pigment in industries, is readily available in large quantities at low-cost, which is favorable for the practical application of OSCs. However, early studies demonstrate that PDI as an acceptor is not successful since it forms large aggregates in BHJ blends, which are far beyond the ideal length scale of exciton diffusion in OSCs. Consequently, chemical approaches are employed to develop non-planar PDI derivatives that can enhance their device performances.

There are diverse methods to prepare non-planar PDI derivatives. For instance, the introduction of branched alkyl chains or aromatic groups at imide or bay positions of PDI is quite effective. Dimerization of PDI moieties is also used by introducing thiophene and bithiophene linkers or directly coupling two PDI units at their bay or imide positions. When four PDI units (tetramers) are used, a 3D molecular geometry can be achieved using tetraphenylethylene, tetraphenylmethane, and spirobifluorene centers.
Despite some successful examples being reported, a unified way to access PDI-based acceptors, in particular, those showing both good photovoltaic properties and simple chemical structures, still needs to be explored. Herein, we demonstrate a new molecular design strategy to access high-performance PDI acceptors through facile synthesis. The target molecule B(PDI)3 is synthesized in a one-step reaction by attaching three bulky PDI chromophores to the 1,3,5-positions of the benzene centre (Scheme 1). This results in a crowded arrangement of PDI moieties, breaking the intrinsic symmetry of B(PDI)3, thus suppressing the strong crystallization of PDI units while preserving the good π–π interactions between adjacent molecules. This would ensure efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport when applying B(PDI)3 as a non-fullerene acceptor in OSCs. And we find that the energy levels of B(PDI)3, especially the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), are similar to those of PC61BM, allowing B(PDI)3 to match with narrow band-gap polymer donors, for example, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th). OSCs are fabricated using PTB7-Th as the donor and B(PDI)3 as the acceptor, yielding a high PCE of 5.65% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.83 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 13.12 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.52. These results demonstrate that the rational design of the molecular geometry of PDI molecules would be an efficient route for the synthesis of high-performance non-fullerene acceptors for OSC applications.

The synthesis route to B(PDI)3 is shown in Scheme 1, and B(PDI)3 is easily obtained via a one-step palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction between a tri-boric ester functionalized benzene ring and three brominated PDI units. 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF MS, and elemental analysis are applied to identify the chemical structure of B(PDI)3. The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S1) clearly shows that the molecular coplanarity and symmetry of B(PDI)3 have been interrupted because three PDI units are inequivalent in a chemical environment, leading to the splitting of the NMR peaks for each hydrogen atom. This finding agrees with the previous report. To understand the molecular geometry of B(PDI)3, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with B3LYP 6-31G basic sets are carried out, and the results are illustrated in Scheme 1. As predicted, it can be seen from the side view that the B(PDI)3 molecule is indeed highly twisted with the broken coplanarity and symmetry: two PDI units are clockwise tilted to the benzene ring while one PDI unit is anti-clockwise tilted. The dihedral angle between a PDI moiety and the benzene ring is calculated to be 51.4°. Besides, every single PDI chromophore in B(PDI)3 is also found to be non-planar with a twisting angle of 19.9°. From the top view, the PDI π-surfaces are still accessible for adjacent molecules. From the front view, the molecular size of B(PDI)3 is observed to be about 1.72 nm in diameter. Such a small size with a highly congested molecular construction and twisted geometry is expected to effectively prevent B(PDI)3 from forming large aggregates in solid, which is beneficial for OSCs. The thermal properties of B(PDI)3 are investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) under a nitrogen atmosphere is found to be 388 °C, indicating the good thermal stability of B(PDI)3 (ESI, Fig. S2). The DSC study shows that B(PDI)3 has a melting peak at 230 °C during the heating process and a crystallization peak at 183 °C during the cooling process, and the crystallization heat is much lower than that of PDI monomers, proving that the strong crystallization tendency of PDI chromophores in B(PDI)3 has been suppressed (ESI, Fig. S3).


Fig. 1a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of B(PDI)3 in solution and film, and the absorption of the PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3 blended thin film. Whether solution or film, the absorption of B(PDI)3 is mainly located in the 400–600 nm region. It is interesting to observe that the B(PDI)3 thin film exhibits well resolved resonant peaks similar to those for solution, suggesting the low crystallinity of B(PDI)3. In the blended thin film, a complementary absorption is seen from B(PDI)3 and PTB7-Th, which leads to a broad absorption from 400 to 800 nm. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of B(PDI)3 is shown in Fig. 1b. The onset reduction potential and onset oxidation potential are found to be −0.54 and 1.60 V (versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)). Therefore, the LUMO and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels are calculated to be −3.86 eV and −6.0 eV, respectively. The band-gap of B(PDI)3 is determined to be 2.14 eV. These energy levels are deep enough to match with the frontier orbitals of PTB7-Th.

B(PDI)3 is used as a non-fullerene acceptor in OSCs adopting an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3/MoO3/Ag. J–V curves of OSCs are shown in Fig. 2c and the related performance parameters, such as Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, are summarized in Table 1. The donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios are first considered during device fabrication. We vary this parameter from 1:1 to 1:3 and find that 1:1.5 is the best condition. A high PCE of 5.24% at a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 13.09 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.48 is obtained for the as-cast 1:1.5 ratio devices. As expected, these devices all show high photocurrents. In order to promote the efficiency, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) is used as the additive, which has been proved to be useful for enhancing the performances of PDI acceptor based OSCs. We try different CN amounts from 0.5% to 4% and observe that 3% CN works best. In the devices processed with 3% CN, the best PCE of 5.65% is achieved at a Voc of 0.83, a Jsc of 13.12 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.52. The improvement of efficiency is attributed to the increase of the FF, and we guess that the CN additive may optimize the BHJ morphology to some extent. Other post-treatments such as thermal annealing or using DIO as the additive are also used to optimize the device performances, but no obvious improvements are observed.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2d. We see two intense photovoltaic response regions (400–600 nm and 600–800 nm) in EQE curves. The maximum EQE value is found to be 62%. Besides, the shape of the EQE curve is similar to that of the blend absorption curve, and thus excitons generated from both PTB7-Th and B(PDI)3 can be effectively dissociated to contribute to the photocurrent.

The space charge limited current (SCLC) method is employed to study the charge transport of PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3 blended thin films. The structure of hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3/MoO3/Al, while the structure of electron-only devices is ITO/PFN/PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3/PFN/Al. The J0.5–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI). The hole mobilities are calculated to be 8.60 × 10−5 and 17.48 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 without or with CN as the additive. A similar increase of electron mobility is observed from 2.23 × 10−5 to 4.20 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the 1:1.5 blends. The addition of CN increases the hole mobility and electron mobility of BHJs, resulting in better efficiencies of OSCs.


The structural order of PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3 blends is investigated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). The corresponding diffraction images and the out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts are shown in Fig. 3. PTB7-Th takes a face-on orientation on the substrate.

The (010) π–π stacking shows up in the out-of-plane direction, at 1.61 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 0.39 nm. The crystal size or crystal coherence length is estimated to be 1.7 nm from the full-width-half-maximum of the diffraction peak. The (100) peak is located at 0.26 Å−1. The corresponding d-spacing is 2.4 nm. The crystal size is estimated to be 7.1 nm. The (001) peak of PTB7-Th is located at 0.086 Å−1. B(PDI)3 in thin film shows a diffraction peak at 0.32 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 2.0 nm. A second order reflection is seen for this feature. The crystal size is estimated to be 5.6 nm. This long distance is expected to be the molecule particle inter-distance, stacked in the alkyl chain stretched direction. The B(PDI)3 crystal does not take a preferred orientation. At higher angles, an amorphous halo is seen at 1.3 Å−1 and a weak π–π stacking peak at 1.74 Å−1. The π–π stacking distance is thus 0.36 nm, which is in a good region for electron transport. The coherence length of the B(PDI)3 π–π stacking is estimated to be only 1.3 nm, thus only accounting for the adjacent two congested molecules. Thus we suspect that electrons can freely locate in the B(PDI)3 molecule and hop to other molecules via PDI co-facial stacking.
In the as-cast BHJ thin film, an obvious peak shows up at 0.31 Å−1, which should come from the B(PDI)3 long distance stacking. The crystal size is estimated to be 5.1 nm. In the high angle position, the diffraction is dominated by the amorphous halo and the π–π stacking from B(PDI)3. This π–π stacking is calculated to be 1.2 nm in size in the out-of-plane direction, similar to the molecule in the pure film. When the CN additive is used, a similar diffraction peak shows up at 0.31 Å−1, with a slightly increased size of 5.7 nm. In the high angle region, the diffraction is dominated by the amorphous features and the peak at ∼1.6 nm, coming from the π–π stacking of PTB7-Th. The scattering from B(PDI)3 is shadowed by the strong peak from PTB7-Th and cannot be easily separated. Thus the CN additive in processing helps to enhance the π–π stacking of the PTB7-Th polymer, which is a reason for the enhanced hole-transport in BHJ thin films.
The phase separation in BHJ thin films is studied using resonance soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). A series of photon energies close to the carbon K edge are used in the experiment. However, the scattering profiles do not show well-defined peaks, and thus the BHJ thin film is less prominently phase separated in both as-cast and CN additive cases. In fact the chemical nature of PTB7-Th and B(PDI)3 is similar. A good mixing is expected. The material contrast at different photon energies can also be small, and thus no clear feature can be captured. In fact the presence of B(PDI)3 clearly disturbs the crystallization of PTB7-Th, especially in the (100) direction. The polymer chain in the blends remains stiff and stretched, and thus the (001) diffraction can still be captured. While electrons can hop through the PDI co-facial stacking and holes can transport through the PTB7-Th π–π stacking and main chain, and thus bicontinuous channels can still exist. The CN additive helps to improve the π–π stacking of PTB7-Th, without changing the global morphology, and thus only a minor improvement in the device performance is observed.

To summarize, we present a successful design of congested molecular particles using PDI trimers, which can be used in bulk heterojunction solar cells with the well-established high-performance polymer donor PTB7-Th. The best device gives a PCE of 5.65% at a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 13.12 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.52. It can be seen that the highly twisted molecular structure helps reducing the strong crystallization of PDI moieties. And the formation of nano-sized molecular particles with an aromatic π surface towards outside can help the electron transport. In this direction, short-range stacking of PDI molecules can be maintained for forming charge-transporting channels. The resulting acceptor can favourably interact with PTB7-Th, leading to a reduced structural order of the conjugated polymer. The π–π stacking from polymer chains can be recovered by using the CN additive, without changing the global morphology. These results demonstrate that the congested molecular design of the PDI structure can be an effective approach to good non-fullerene acceptors.

The mixture was frozen with liquid nitrogen, followed by three times of successive vacuum and nitrogen fill cycles, and Pd(PPh3)4 (60 mg, 0.052 mmol) was added under the protection of nitrogen, and another three times of successive vacuum and nitrogen fill cycles were performed. Then, the mixture was refluxed at 80 °C for 72 h. After removing the solvent, the product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane:dichloromethane = 1:1–1:4), yielding a red solid (0.44 g, 86%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 8.92–7.62 (m, 24H), 5.27–4.94 (m, 6H), 2.36–1.98 (m, 12H), 1.98–1.61 (m, 12H), 1.48–0.95 (m, 96H), 0.95–0.59 (m, 36H).

Organic solar cells were fabricated on glass substrates commercially pre-coated with a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) with the inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3/MoO3/Ag. Prior to fabrication, the substrates were cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol consecutively every 15 min and then treated in an ultraviolet ozone generator for 15 min. A thin layer of sol–gel ZnO (≈40 nm) was spin coated onto precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates and then annealed at 180 °C for 15 min. The PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3 active layers were deposited from 20 mg mL−1 solutions without or with CN as the additive in chlorobenzene by spin-coating at 3000 rpm, resulting in an active layer thickness of about 100 nm. MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were evaporated through a shadow mask, giving an active area of 5.2 mm2 per device.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs were measured with Keithley 2400 measurement source units at room temperature in air. The photocurrent was measured with a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300W) at 100 mW cm−2 and the light intensity was calibrated with a standard photovoltaic (PV) reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured with a Stanford lock-in amplifier 8300 unit.
The charge carrier mobilities of the PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3 films were measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated in a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3(1:1.5)/MoO3/Al, and electron-only devices were fabricated in a structure of ITO/PFN/PTB7-Th:B(PDI)3(1:1.5)/PFN/Al. The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias using the SCLC expression described by the Mott–Gurney law:

Grazing incidence X-ray scattering characterization of the thin films was performed at the Advanced Light Source on beamline 7.3.3, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Thin film samples were prepared on wafer substrates. The scattering signal was recorded on a 2D detector (Pilatus 2M) with a pixel size of 0.172 mm by 0.172 mm. The samples were ≈15 mm long in the direction of the beam path, and the detector was located at a distance of ≈300 mm from the sample center (distance calibrated using a silver behenate standard). An incidence angle of 0.16° was chosen which gave the optimized signal-to-background ratio. The beam energy was 10 keV, operating in the top-off mode. Typically, 10 s exposure time was used to collect diffraction signals. All GIXD experiments were done in a helium atmosphere. The data were processed and analyzed using the Nika software package. The crystal size or crystal coherence length was calculated according to the Scherrer equation:

RSoXS was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 Advanced Light Source, LBNL. Thin film samples were spin-cast on the top of the PEDOT:PSS covered Si wafers under exactly the same conditions as those for the fabrication of solar cell devices. The BHJ thin films were then floated and transferred onto silicon nitride membrane windows. The scattering was performed in the transmission mode and the signals were collected in a vacuum using a Princeton Instrument PI-MTE CCD camera.
