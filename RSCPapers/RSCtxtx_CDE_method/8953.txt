We report that through the incorporation of polar self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) at the indium tin oxide (ITO)/donor interface in chloroaluminium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc)/C60 discrete heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, the power conversion efficiency can be dramatically increased. This enhanced performance is due to better alignment between the hole-extracting electrode Fermi level and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the ClAlPc donor, as well as an improved surface compatibility which provides a more optimised electrode/donor interface. Optimised cells demonstrate an increase of ∼85% in open circuit voltage which results in a near three-fold increase in power conversion efficiency from 1.3% to 3.3% under 1 sun illumination. Comparative studies are made using cells based on two other organic donor materials, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and boron subphthalocyanine (SubPc).

Photovoltaics (PVs) are a promising technology to help eradicate the problems with current energy demands through converting sunlight into electricity, rather than through the burning of fossil fuels. Currently, silicon (Si) solar cells dominate the market with efficiencies of ∼25% but the costs remain uninviting in comparison to current power sources. Organic PVs (OPVs) have the potential to compete with current Si based cells as they have the potential to be low cost and are easier to process. Unfortunately, the efficiencies of OPVs cannot compete with the high efficiency Si cells and significant improvements are needed in order to become a commercial reality. In this communication we demonstrate the effect of simply incorporating a self-assembled monolayer between the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and the overlying organic donor material. Through this simple modification the device performance is greatly improved and the work highlights the importance of studying and optimising this interface, in the hopes of achieving a high efficiency OPV device.


Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is a highly active research field primarily because of the relative ease of fabrication, the potential for a substantial reduction in cost in comparison to conventional PVs, and the very attractive ecological advantages. Since Tang's promising discovery of a small molecule heterojunction OPV device in 1986, significant advances in performance have been made due to the development of new materials, controlled nanostructuring, and through addition of exciton blocking and hole-extracting layers. Single junction small molecule OPVs can now achieve power conversion efficiencies (ηp) of ∼4% and it is generally thought that they will become commercially viable if efficiencies of >8% can be achieved.

The insertion of exciton blocking layers such as bathocuproine (BCP), between the acceptor layer and the electron extracting metal electrode, has resulted in significant increases in short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and ηp. Similarly, the introduction of hole-extracting metal oxide layers at the transparent conducting electrode has also been shown to improve cell performance through an increase in the open circuit voltage (Voc). Unfortunately, increasing Voc through the use of hole-extracting layers has generally proved difficult to achieve without compromising the Jsc. Previous studies have shown that Voc is dependent on the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital energy of the electron donor (HOMOD) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy of the electron acceptor (LUMOA), i.e. the HOMOD–LUMOA offset, or interface gap energy (Ig) However, the maximum Voc achievable has also been shown to be dependent on the electrode work functions, and to maximise Voc the Fermi level of each electrode must be aligned with the relevant HOMOD or LUMOA. The indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode is particularly problematic. Despite having high transparency (80–90%) and good electrical conductivity, the surface of ITO is particularly sensitive to the method of preparation and the work function has been shown to range from 4.0 to 5.5 eV. Due to poor batch-to-batch reproducibility, compatibility issues with the overlying organics, and problems with the work function surface stability, this can have an extremely detrimental effect on both cell performance and consistency.
It is well known that self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are an effective way of controlling the surface properties of electrodes such as ITO and the approach has been used very successfully to improve the performance of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and inverted polymer OPVs. Surprisingly, only a small number of studies report the use of SAMs in small molecule OPVs, with no significant improvement in cell performance demonstrated. For example, Sharma et al. used a variety of SAMs to tune the work function of ITO from 4.5 eV to 5.4 eV (bare ITO = 4.8 eV) in pentacene/C60 planar heterojunction devices, with little overall change in device performance observed when incorporating the different SAMs. By contrast, when Khodabakhsh et al. incorporated SAMs into copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/C60 devices, the Jsc and FF were found to increase due to increased compatibility between the ITO electrode and the CuPc and improved hole extraction at the ITO electrode. However, the overall increase in ηp in the device was still very limited.
In this paper, we study the effect of modifying the work function of the ITO electrode using a range of dipolar carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid SAMs, and compare the performance of planar heterojunction cells based on three different phthalocyanine donor materials; ClAlPc, CuPc and SubPc. Optimised cells based on ClAlPc/C60 heterojunctions demonstrate dramatic increases in Jsc, Voc, and FF, resulting in a near three-fold increase in ηp from 1.3% to 3.3% under 1 sun illumination.

Cells were fabricated on commercially available ITO-coated glass (Psiotec, 100 nm thick, Rs < 15 Ω sq−1) after cleaning by sonication in acetone, detergent, water and isopropanol, and an ultraviolet/ozone treatment (UV–O3) to remove carbon residues. Solutions of each acid (1 × 10−3 mol dm−3) were prepared in a chloroform:methanol mix and the ITO substrates were immersed in the solution for 16 hours. The substrates were then rinsed sparingly with a clean solvent, dried with a stream of dry N2 and stored under nitrogen. Contact angles were measured using a Kruss DSA 100 instrument. The OPVs were fabricated using a Kurt. J. Lesker Spectros high vacuum evaporation system. The organic materials: CuPc (Aldrich, 98%), ClAlPc (Acros Organics, 98%), SubPc (Aldrich, 85%), C60 (MER Corp., 99.5%), and BCP (Aldrich, 96%) were purified using thermal gradient sublimation before deposition. The aluminium electrodes were deposited in situ by evaporation through a shadow mask to a thickness of 100 nm to give an active pixel area of 0.16 cm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under AM1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun) from a Newport Oriel solar simulator. Work function measurements were taken under nitrogen using a Kelvin Probe (KP, Besocke Delta Phi GmbH) with a 5 mm diameter gold probe. Kelvin probe-atomic force microscopy (KP-AFM) images were obtained using an Asylum research MFP-3D in both AC and KP-AFM mode.

Fig. 1(a) shows the changes in the ITO electrode work function before and after modification with the different SAMs. Table 1 summarises the work functions and contact angle measurements of the SAM surface treatments with reference to UV–O3 treated ITO. A clear change in wettability occurs after modification with the SAMs, indicative of their presence. No change was observed in the overlying morphology of the subsequently deposited organic donor layers beyond a few nanometres film thickness, suggesting any subsequent changes in device performance cannot be due to significant structural or morphological changes in the organic semiconductor film. This is similar to observations by Khodabakhsh et al. It is supported by a lack of any measurable change in the electronic absorption spectra (not shown) between the organic semiconductor layers deposited on ITO or the ITO/SAM electrodes. The increase in the hydrophobicity of the surface after treatment with the SAMs improves compatibility with the overlying organic donor material, creating an increased degree of uniformity at the electrode/organic interface.Fig. 1(b) shows a schematic of the corresponding energy levels in the OPV devices. The HOMO energies for CuPc,ClAlPc,C60 and BCP are taken from ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, whereas the corresponding SubPc values are determined from cyclic voltammetry (CV). The schematic demonstrates the improved energy level alignment between the Fermi level of the SAM-treated ITO and the HOMO level of both ClAlPc and SubPc. By contrast, there is already an ohmic contact (<0.3 eV difference) between CuPc and the UV–O3 treated ITO substrate.

The surface potential and topography of a 4-chlorobenzoic acid (CBA) SAM-coated ITO substrate, as measured by KP-AFM, are shown overlaid on one another in Fig. 2. The image provides clear evidence of the presence of the SAM and confirms that the change in surface potential is not due to any variations in morphology as a result of the surface modification. The change in work function can clearly be seen across the ITO/CBA interface, with the large difference of ∼200 mV being in good agreement with the 200 meV difference between the ITO and ITO/CBA work functions measured using the static KP technique.

J–V characteristics in the dark and under 1 sun illumination for the different ClAlPc/C60 devices are shown in Fig. 3 with key device parameters listed in Table 1. The basic device structure was: ITO/surface treatment A–H/ClAlPc (20 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Al and they were fabricated with either benzoic acid or phosphonic acid SAM molecules. The reference OPV device (using UV–O3 treated ITO) gave a Jsc of 5.42 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.52 and a Voc of 0.46 V, resulting in ηp = 1.3%. Through addition of the CBA SAM at the interface, the Jsc is increased to 6.84 mA cm−2, the FF to 0.59, and the Voc and ηp both increase significantly to 0.79 V and 3.3% respectively. The inset shows typical J–V characteristics when different phosphonic acids were used as the SAMs. In this case the best devices were fabricated with the CPA SAM and demonstrated a maximum Jsc of 6.29 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.50, with Voc and ηp increasing to 0.76 V and 2.7% respectively.
The correlation between the work function and Voc for the different ClAlPc/C60 devices is shown in Fig. 4. For comparison results are also shown for CuPc/C60 and SubPc/C60 OPV devices. As previously reported by Khodabakhsh et al. there is no improvement in Voc in the CuPc/C60 devices due to the relatively well-aligned ohmic contact (<0.3 eV difference) between the electrode work function of UV–O3 treated ITO and the HOMOCuPc. The CuPc/C60 device on UV–O3 treated ITO yielded Voc = 0.43 ± 0.03 V, Jsc = 3.91 ± 0.75 mA cm−2, FF = 0.51 ± 0.03 and ηp = 0.85 ± 0.28% with the SAM-modified device performances being very similar. By contrast, with the ClAlPc/C60 devices the voltage increased from 0.47 V to 0.80 V with the introduction of the SAMs, which we believe results from improved alignment between the work function of the electrode (∼5.00 eV) and the HOMOClAlPc (5.3 eV) and a resulting improved ohmic contact.
As a larger Voc is seen when benzoic acid (BA) is used as the SAM (Φ = +0.12 eV in comparison to ITO) the increase in Voc cannot only be due to the improved energy level alignment. It is also possibly due to the more hydrophobic nature of the surface which increases compatibility with the overlying organic layer. It also creates a more stable work function across the surface removing any “dead” or “hot” spots that are known to characterize bare ITO surfaces. To confirm the increase it is useful to compare the results obtained from the SubPc/C60 devices also fabricated on the SAM modified electrodes (Table 2). An increase in Voc is again seen which follows a similar trend to the ClAlPc/C60 devices. The Voc increased from 0.56 V (UV–O3 treated ITO) to 0.61 V when BA is incorporated which supports the increase in surface compatibility playing an important part in increasing the Voc. To achieve higher Voc values a more favourable alignment is desired. This is shown with the increase from 4.80 eV (UV–O3 ITO) to 5.06 eV (SAM = FBA) causing an increase of ∼70% in the Voc from 0.56 V to 0.95 V. This supports the theory that the Voc is related to the electrode work function, as well as a higher Voc being achieved for the bilayer devices with the largest Ig.

In a study of pentacene/C60 OPV devices, Sharma et al. found that through tuning the work function of ITO, no improvements in device performance were seen due to Fermi level pinning between the ITO and the pentacene donor layer, as only a marginal change in binding energy was seen. In our case there is an increase in both Jsc and FF when the SAMs are incorporated into the ClAlPc/C60 and SubPc/C60 OPVs which must be due to the improved hole extraction at the electrode as well as the built-in field. The morphologies of both the donor and acceptor layers in the device are unchanged. Through adding a dipole layer to the electrode, it has been shown that the resistance at the electrode/organic interface decreases resulting in an increase in the probability of charge collection before recombination, hence the higher Jsc and FF values. Through increasing the electrode work function the built-in field is increased which provides a greater driving force for charge collection. The increasing current also seems to correlate well with improved energy level alignment. The exception is the slight decrease in current in the FBA device which could be due to interfacial problems between the fluorine and the ClAlPc molecules resulting in poorer charge collection (also seen in SubPc/C60 devices). As the monolayer is extremely thin (<1 nm) the current does not decrease to the extent previously seen when introducing metal oxide hole-extracting layers, where a marginal decrease is seen using 5 nm of MoO3 and a 1.5 mA cm−2 decrease when incorporating a 50 nm layer.
In summary, the incorporation of benzoic and phosphonic acid SAMs between the ITO electrode and ClAlPc and SubPc donor layers is shown to be an effective way of increasing both Voc and Jsc in molecular bilayer OPV devices, increasing the efficiency from 1.3% to 3.3% for an optimised ClAlPc/C60 device. We believe this increase is not only due to increasing the surface hydrophobicity which allows for greater compatibility with the organic layer, but also due to a greater alignment between the work function of the electrode and the HOMO of the donor material. The addition of SAMs is a simple and extremely effective way of tuning the electrode surface to increase compatibility with various organic donor materials and therefore improve device parameters. It is therefore a viable route for optimizing OPV device performances.
