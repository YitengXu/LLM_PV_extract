A new electron deficient building block, difluorobenzothiadiazole (FBT) was designed and synthesized for the first time. Two low band gap polymers containing this unit or benzothiadiazole (BT) and an electron rich unit, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction. It was found that fluorine substitution significantly lowered the energy levels but did not affect the UV absorption properties of the polymer. Comparatively, the fluorinated polymer showed a higher melting point and a reduced solubility. The electrical and photovoltaic properties of these polymers were studied by fabricating thin film transistors and polymer solar cells. The solar cell based on FBT polymer and PC71BM gives power conversion efficiency up to 3.4% under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2).

Compared with inorganic silicon based solar cells, organic solar cells show huge commercial potentials for flexible and large area applications, because the devices could be manufactured by existing low-cost industrial technology, such as ink-jet and roll to roll printing. Another important advantage of organic solar cells is the diversity of the molecular structures in organic chemistry, where numerous combinations of various building blocks are available. So the properties of the resulting materials, such as solubility, charge mobility and energy levels for photovoltaic applications can be easily tuned.

Up to now, the most efficient and commonly used architecture for the active layer of organic solar cells is the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of two components: a conducting polymer as an electron donor and a fullerene derivative as an electron acceptor. For the conducting polymers, several crucial properties are required to achieve a highly efficient solar cell. First, it should have a good solubility and can be easily fabricated into a thin film from solution. Second, the polymer should show high absorption toward sun light since fullerene derivatives only has very limited absorption in the solar spectrum. Third, the polymer should have a good hole mobility, at least comparable to the electron mobility of fullerene derivatives, so the separated charge carrier can be easily transported to the corresponding electrodes. Forth, the energy levels of this polymer should match with fullerene to facilitate efficient exciton separation and charge transfer.
To satisfy these requirements, people usually build alternating copolymers comprised of electron rich and electron deficient units. On one hand, such a structure can induce intra-chain charge transfer and dramatically lower the band gap of resulting polymers. So the polymers often show strong absorption in the visible region. On the other hand, their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels can be easily adjusted by choosing different combinations of electron rich and deficient units. Among the vast variety of the developed electron deficient blocks, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) has attracted much research attentions, and has been copolymerized with many electron rich units, such as fluorene, 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene,carbazole,benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole,dithienosilole,indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, and indenofluoreneetc. High performance solar cell devices with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 5% have been reported by several groups based on these materials. Furthermore, the 5 and 6 positions of BT are available to attach with a functional group to modify properties of the final polymers. For example, Boetc. introduced two alkyloxy chains there to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers. Yamashita etc. fused other electron deficient rings to these positions to obtain [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline and benzo[1,2-c;3,4-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole, which demonstrated very strong electron withdrawing capability and resulted in ultra-small band gap polymers.
In this work, we attempted to introduce two fluorine atoms onto these two positions to produce a new electron deficient unit, 4,7-di(thien-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (FBT). This unit was then copolymerized with an electron rich BDT unit to afford a new copolymer, poly(4,8-di(3-pentyl-undecyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-4,7-bis(4-octyl-2-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (P2). For comparison, its non-fluorinated counterpart, poly(4,8-di(3-pentyl-undecyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-4,7-bis(4-octyl-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (P1) was also prepared. Their optical, electrochemical, thermal properties, and their devices performance in thin film transistors (TFT) and BHJ solar cells have been characterized. We demonstrated that the fluorine substitution did not change the UV absorption but pushed down the HOMO energy level, thus improved the environmental stability of corresponding polymer. The organic solar cells based on FBT polymer also showed a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than BT polymer.

Fluorinated conjugated polymers show very interesting features.Fluorine atoms can lower both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, so the materials will display a greater resistance against the degradative oxidation. A lower HOMO energy level also means a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) for polymer solar cells since Voc is usually determined by the difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the fullerene derivative. These features are highly desired in polymer materials for photovoltaic applications. Indeed, high Voc and very high PCE were obtained by introducing fluorine into organic photovoltaic polymers very recently.

Based on the well studied BT structure, we designed and synthesized fluorinated BT as shown in Scheme 1. This synthesis started from nitration of 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene, which was prepared using a reported two-step reaction in a high yield (90%). The crude product can be purified by column chromatograph to give a pure product 1 in a moderate yield (31%), which was then reacted with 2-tributyl stannyl-4-octyl thiophene to give compound 2 by palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. Two nitro groups on 2 were reduced to diamine 3 using iron powder in acetic acid solution. Heterocycle 4 was prepared in 94% yield by reacting diamine 3 with N-thionylaniline and trimethylsilyl chloride in pyridine at 80 °C.Dibromo-monomer 5 was obtained by bromination of 4 with NBS in chloroform using silica gel as catalyst. We introduced octyl side chains on each thiophene unit to improve the solubility of the resulting polymers.
Recently, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) based polymers have shown very promising properties in organic electronic devices, especially in polymer solar cells. During the preparation of this manuscript, You etc. reported a BDT based polymer with branched alkyl groups at the 4- and 8- position of BDT. However, detailed synthetic procedure, especially the synthesis of the key starting compound (branched alkyl chain substituted acetylene) was not reported. We independently synthesized a similar BDT monomer and the procedure is shown in Scheme 2. Compound 6 was synthesized by a chain extension reaction of 1-octyne. It is interesting that two equivalent of n-butyl lithium will react with 1-octyne to form a 1,3-dilithiooctyne intermediate, which will then react with 1-bromooctane on the more reactive 3-position to give compound 6 after acid treatment and purification. Alkynylmagnesium chloride was generated in situ from 6 by reacting with isopropylmagnesium chloride. It reacted with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione at 55 °C. After reduction by SnCl2 in hydrochloride solution, dialkynyl substituted intermediate 7 was obtained in 66% yield. Hydrogenation converted the alkynyl side chain to alkyl and trimethylstannyl monomer 9 was obtained by reacting 8 with n-butyl lithium followed with trimethyltin chloride. It is worth to note that this monomer has a very similar structure as another BDT monomer reported by Yu′s group, where a branched alkoxy group are used instead. It has been reported that the replacement of alkoxy with alkyl group will reduce the electron donating effect and lower the HOMO energy level of the resulted polymers.

Polymers
P1 and P2 were synthesized viaStille coupling reaction as shown in Scheme 3, where BT or FBT were used as electron deficient units and BDT was used as electron rich unit. Both polymers were carefully purified by extracting with acetone and then hexanes to remove oligmers and other small molecular part, and GPC analysis showed high molecular weight polymers were obtained (Table 1). P1 can dissolve in chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature while P2 can only dissolve in these solvents at elevated temperature.

The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of the chlorobenzene solution and the thin film of polymers P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. 1. Both polymers show very similar absorption bands in chlorobenzene solution with a major absorption peak at 558 nm for P1 and 554 nm for P2. This band can be assigned to the intra molecular charge transfer interaction between electron rich and deficient units. The other band in short-wavelength near 400 nm can be assigned to 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) units, which was often observed in DTBT containing conjugated polymers. In the solid state, the main absorption peak becomes broader and the maximum shifts toward longer wavelength at 615 nm for P1 and 622 nm for P2. This large red shift of ∼60 nm from solution to solid state means more coplanar structure and stronger inter chain π–π stacking in the solid state. It is interesting that a shoulder peak appeared near 680 nm for P1 but not for P2.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these two polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2). The onset potentials of the first oxidation wave of P1 and P2 appeared at 0.92 and 1.10 V, corresponding to HOMO energy levels of 5.30 and 5.48 eV respectively. As expected, this indicated that the introduction of two fluorine atoms on the conjugated backbone can substantially lower the HOMO energy level of the polymer by 0.18 eV. This fluorine effect was less significant in another fluorinated polymer where only one fluorine atom was attached to each repeating unit of the polymer backbone. Since the first reduction wave of the polymers was hard to determine, the LUMO energy levels were then estimated from the optical band gap and the relative data were summarized in Table 1. It is interesting that the fluorine substitution does not apparently change the UV absorption and band gap, but lowers HOMO energy level. This will lead to an improved Voc for the polymer solar cell devices and better environmental stability of the material.

The thermal properties of these polymers were studied by differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 3). Both P1 and P2 showed a broad and strong melting peak at 247 and 284 °C respectively, but no discernible glass transition. A corresponding crystallization peak was also observed for both polymers in the cooling scan with the crystallizing temperature very close to the melting temperature, indicating both polymers have a strong crystallization capability. The thermal decomposition temperatures (2% weight loss) of P1 and P2 are 403 °C and 408 °C respectively, showing good thermal stability for optoelectronic devices.

To characterize the crystal structures of these polymers in thin film, XRD studies were carried out and the curves are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate a lamellar crystal structure for both polymers. A broad peak appeared at 2θ of 6.95° and 6.53° for P1 and P2, corresponding to an inter-layer spacing of 14.8 and 15.7 Å respectively. P1 showed one broad π–π stacking peak at 2θ of 25.2° (4.1 Å), while P2 showed a broad peak at 23.9° (4.32 Å) and a more strong and narrow peak at 28.3°, corresponding to a very small π–π stacking distance of 3.66 Å. We propose that there is stronger interchain interaction in the fluorinated polymer P2 than in P1, as P2 shows poorer solubility, higher melting point and closer stacking distance.

As the performance of organic optoelectronic materials for transistor or photovoltaic applications is closely related to their charge carrier mobility, we fabricated bottom-contact organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) to measure the field-effect mobility of these polymers. Fig. 5 shows representative I–V characteristics of these devices fabricated from P1 and P2. Both polymers displayed a well-defined saturation region with p-channel transport (h+) mobility of 2.12 × 10−4 cm2/Vs for P1 and 4.88 × 10−5 cm2/Vs for P2 respectively. To our surprise, P2 has a lower hole mobility, although it has a higher crystallization capability than P1. We do not have a clear explanation for this phenomenon. It might be related to the orientation of the crystal structure relative to the substrate. In addition, the relative poor film quality of polymer P2 due to its low solubility may also influence the charge transfer. This issue could be improved by adjusting the processing conditions such as the solvent, temperature, spin speed, annealing and so on.


Polymer solar cells were fabricated from P1 or P2 and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with a general device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer: PC71BM/LiF/Al. Different polymer to fullerene weight ratio, solvents and processing temperature are tested to optimize the device performance. Fig. 6a showed typical current density-voltage (J-V) curves and the devices performance data were summarized in Table 2. Device fabricated from a blend of P1 with PC71BM at 1/2 weight ratio gave a Voc of 0.69 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.15 mA cm−2, a modest fill factor (FF) of 44.3% and a PCE of 1.88%. The device from P2 with PC71BM at 1/1 weight ratio gives a better result with a similar Voc of 0.69 V, a higher Jsc of 8.89 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 55.4%. The PCE thus reached 3.4%. It should be noted that the best device for P1 is fabricated from o-dichlorobenzene solution with 2.5% DIO as an additive at 70 °C while the blend of P2 and PC71BM has to be spin-coated from 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene solution at 90 °C. It is important that different solvents and processing temperature should be used to get optimized performance. We noted that the devices from P1 and P2 show similar Voc although there is a big difference between their HOMO energy levels (0.18 eV). This is tentatively explained by the decreased surface energy of fluorinated polymer. The lower surface energy of the fluorinated polymer enhanced the tendency of the polymer to migrate to the air/film interface during spin coating, resulting in the relative enrichment of the polymer at the top of the active layer. This kind of structure is not beneficial for charge transport to corresponding electrodes and could lower the Voc of the devices because of the accumulation of space charge. However, this fluorinated polymer may be used in an inverted structure where high concentration of polymer on top layer will benefit. As shown in Fig. 6b, external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these devices were tested which cover 300 nm to 700 nm range. Devices of P2 showed a higher efficiency (∼45%) than P1 (∼30%), and the integrated Jsc from EQE data agrees well with the data from J-V curves (see Table 2).

We then studied the surface morphological structure of the polymer/PC71BM blend film using tapping mode AFM and the images are shown in Fig. 7. The phase image of the film from P1 with PC71BM (Fig. 7c) showed obscure domains without clear phase segregation, this may explain the modest FF of 44.3% obtained from this device. However, the film from P2 and PC71BM has a more clear structure which shows bright domains with the size of ∼20 nm. This domain size is desired for better charge separation, and thus agrees with the improved FF of 55%. It should be noted that the phase image scale for P2 (0–100°) is much larger than the one for P1 (0–30°). The bright spots in Fig. 7d can be assigned to the crystalline domains of fluorinated polymer P2 due to decreased surface energy, and the detection of polymer P2 on the top layer of the film also partially support our previous assumption on the accumulation of the fluorinated polymer on air/film interface.


Polymer thin films (∼40 nm) were prepared by spin coating o-dichlorobenzene solution on glass substrate and the stability of the polymer thin films in air was investigated by UV-vis spectrum. The absorption spectra of these thin films were monitored over time while keeping the films under ambient condition. It was reported that oxygen and water can diffuse into the active layer of a polymer solar cell and cause photo-oxidative bleaching under ambient condition and continuous illumination. The degree of this oxidative reaction for the donor polymer is closely related to the position of its HOMO energy level. Fig. 8a showed that the maximum absorption of P1 film decreased by 27% and blue shift from 615 nm to 586 nm after exposure to air and ambient light for 312 h, meaning dramatic decreasing of the number of original polymer chains and shortening of the conjugation length. However, after the same exposure, the maximum absorption peak of polymer P2 only decreased by 17% and the position retained at 620 nm. This result demonstrates the improved stability of this series of polymer by fluorine substitution and agrees well with the lowered HOMO energy level from CV data.

A new fluorinated benzothiadiazole monomer, FBT is designed and synthesized. Two alternating conjugated polymers P1 and P2 are prepared based on electron deficient BT or FBT and electron rich BDT monomers. The optical, electrochemical and thermal studies of these two polymers show that the fluorine substitution will not change the UV absorption, but will significantly lower the HOMO energy level. However, this does not result in a higher Voc in the polymer solar cell devices. This phenomenon is believed to be associated with the enrichment of P2 on the top surface of the active layer due to the low surface energy of the polymer as observed by AFM. TFT characterization shows P2 has lower hole mobility, but this drawback may be compensated by the better domain structure formed in the device with enhanced charge separation and transfer, thus better FF and higher PCE are observed from the P2 devices. Finally, the improved environmental stability of the fluorinated polymer is confirmed by the UV study of polymer thin films which are aged in air under ambient light.



NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or o-dichlorobenzene-d4 using a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 399.96 MHz for 1H, 376.29 MHz for 19F, and 100.58 MHz for 13C. 1H and 19F NMR spectra were obtained using a 5 mm indirect detection probe. A 5 mm broadband probe was used for acquiring 13C NMR spectra. CFCl3 was used as an internal standard (0 ppm) for the 19F NMR measurements. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters Breeze HPLC system with 1525 Binary HPLC Pump and 2414 Differential Refractometer) was used for measuring the molecular weight and polydispersity index at 40 °C. Chlorobenzene was used as eluent and commercial polystyrenes were used as standard. UV-vis spectra were measured using a Varian Cary 5000 Spectrometer. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL min−1) using a TA Instruments DSC 2920 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, calibrated with the melting transition of indium. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA Instruments TGA 2950 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (60 mL min−1). MS data were obtained using a Prince capillary electrophoresis system coupled to an API3000 mass spectrometervia a microspray interface. A sheath solution of 1 μL min−12-propanol/methanol (2:1) was used, with 30 mM ammonium acetate dichloromethane–methanol (3:1) as the running buffer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out under argon in a three-electrode cell using 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in anhydrous CH3CN as the supporting electrolyte. The polymers were coated on the platinum-working electrode. The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag quasi-reference electrode, which was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) as an external standard. The E1/2 of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was found to be 0.42 V vs. the Ag quasi-reference electrode. Therefore, the HOMO energy level of the copolymers can be estimated using the empirical equation EHOMO = Eoxon + 4.38 eV, where Eoxon stands for the onset potentials for oxidation relative to the Ag quasi-reference electrode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum was obtained with a Bruker AXS D8 Advance instrument with Co Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.789 Å).

Bottom-contact thin film transistors were fabricated by spin-coating P1 and P2 in o-dichlorobenzene solution at 60 °C on a heavily doped n-Si wafer with an overlayer of SiO2 (230 nm, Ci = 15 nF/cm2). Then gold source and drain electrodes were sputtered on the substrate prior to the deposition of polymer film. The transistor channel length and width are 20 μm and 10 mm, respectively. The current–voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured with a computer-controlled semiconductor parameter analyzer (HP4145A) in a N2 glove box. The hole mobility was deduced from the saturation regime of the J-V characteristics.


Polymer solar cells were fabricated with a general structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned with detergent before sonicated in CMOS grade acetone and isopropanol for 15 min. The organic residue was further removed by treating with UV-ozone for 10 min. Then a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P, H. C. Starck, 45 nm) was spin-coated and dried for 1 h at 120 °C. Polymer P1 or P2 and PC71BM (ADS) (1:2 weight ratio) were dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene containing 2.5% (v/v) diiodooctane or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 80 °C to form a mixture solution. The solution was filtered and spin-coated on the top of PEDOT:PSS layer. The border of the PEDOT:PSS layer and active layer was mechanically removed before 1.0 nm of LiF and 100 nm Al layer were thermally evaporated through a shadow mask at a pressure of 5 × 10−7 mbar in a Boc Edwards Auto 500 System. The active area is 49 mm2.
The current–voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (Sciencetech Inc., SF150). The light intensity was calibrated with a power meter (Gentec Solo PE Laser Power & Energy Meter). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed using a Jobin-Yvon Triax 180 spectrometer, a Jobin-Yvon xenon light source, a Merlin lock-in amplifier, a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR 570 low noise current amplifier.
