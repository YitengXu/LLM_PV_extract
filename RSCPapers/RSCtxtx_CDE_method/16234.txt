We report a small-molecule electron-acceptor based on 2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazole [Vinazene™] for use in solution processed organic solar cells. The material has a favourably located LUMO level of −3.6 eV and absorbs strongly in the visible spectrum up to 520 nm—attractive properties compared to the widely used acceptor (6,6)-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The Vinazene derivative was blended with a poly(2,7-carbazole) donor—chosen for its complementary absorption range and comparatively high-lying HOMO level of −5.6 eV—and incorporated into bulk heterojunction devices. The influence of the donor/acceptor composition and annealing temperature on device performance were then investigated. The best performing devices exhibited reasonable power conversion efficiencies of 0.75% and open-circuit voltages of more than 1.3 V, substantially higher than previously reported devices using small molecule acceptors.

Organic solar cells offer a promising route to low-cost sustainable electricity generation. Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on intimate blends of electron- and hole-transporting materials are of particular interest in this regard as they have achieved high power conversion efficiencies of more than 5%. The most efficient BHJ devices use phenyl-Cx-butyric acid methyl ester [PCBM, x = 61 or 71] as the electron acceptor—derivatives of C60 or C70 that are soluble in a variety of organic solvents. The fullerene core of PCBM readily accepts electrons from a wide range of organic donor materials and exhibits high electron mobilities even in composite form. Nonetheless, it is a non-ideal material for photovoltaic applications due to its weak absorption in the visible spectrum and excessively deep-lying LUMO level, which results in needless energy loss during electron transfer and so limits the efficiencies of the final devices, in particular their open-circuit voltages.

There is a clear need for alternative acceptor materials that—like PCBM—exhibit favourable electron-transporting and processing properties, but which also absorb strongly in the solar spectrum. Of particular interest in this regard is a new class of small molecule acceptor materials based on 2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazole (Vinazene) as recently reported by Shin and co-workers.Vinazene derivatives are soluble in standard organic solvents, have good film-forming properties and exhibit high optical densities. An added advantage is the simple high-yield chemistry involved in their synthesis which, coupled with their inherent chemical flexibility, offers considerable scope for tuning the HOMO and LUMO levels and thereby optimising photovoltaic performance.
In this communication, we report the photovoltaic response of BHJ solar cells based on blends of the specific Vinazene derivative 4,7-bis(2-(1-(2-ethylhexyl)-4,5-dicyanoimidazol-2-yl)vinyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole [EV-BT] and the donor material poly[N-(2′-decyltetradecyl)carbazole]-2,7-diyl [PCz] (Fig. 1). In the initial report by Shin and co-workers, a hexyl version [V-BT] of the acceptor was reported that showed good photovoltaic response when blended with regio-regular poly(hexylthiophene) P3HT, reaching a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.45% under simulated solar irradiation. EV-BT improves on V-BT by offering superior solubility in common solvents due to the 2-ethylhexyl side chain in place of the hexyl. PCz has previously been shown to perform well as a donor material when blended with the small molecule electron transporter perylene tetracarboxydiimide [PDI] and was chosen for use here because its absorption spectrum beneficially plugs a gap in the absorption spectrum of EV-BT, thus ensuring good light harvesting properties from 300 nm to 520 nm (Fig. 2). Importantly, chloroform-based solutions of EV-BT and PCz have excellent film forming properties, yielding smooth uniform films when spin-coated and remaining visually homogeneous even after extended annealing. Another important factor in the choice of a donor material is the energy difference between the donor HOMO and the acceptor LUMO, which largely determines the operating voltage range of the final device and in the case of PCz:EV-BT is 2 eV (see below and Fig. 1)

EV-BT was synthesized via Heck coupling of 1-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazole (ethylhexyl-vinazene) with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole in DMF using bis(tri-tert-butylphosphine)palladium(0) [Pd[P(t-Bu)3]2] as catalyst, and dicyclohexylmethylamine (Cy2NMe) as base/HBr scavenger (please refer to the ESI for a detailed description of the synthesis).
The HOMO and LUMO levels for PCz are taken from ref. 12 (−5.6 and −2.6 eV respectively) while the LUMO level of EV-BT was estimated as −3.6 eV using cyclic voltammetry (see ESI). The onset of optical absorption occurs at ∼520 nm, giving an estimated band-gap of 2.4 eV and an inferred HOMO level of approximately −6.0 eV (see Fig. 1). For the purposes of preliminary characterisation, equal weight ratios of the two materials were dissolved in chloroform and spin coated to produce a thin composite film. The film was excited by monochromatic light at 395 and 444 nm, which correspond to the respective absorption peaks of PCz and EV-BT. In both cases, the photoluminescence was substantially weaker than similarly excited films of neat EV-BT and PCz, indicating efficient exciton dissociation in the blend (see Fig. 2).

BHJ solar cells of the form ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCz:EV-BT/Ca/Ag were fabricated under dry nitrogen by spin-coating PCz:EV-BT films of varying composition from chloroform solutions (see ESI). The influence of blend composition and annealing temperature was investigated using three different weight ratios (PCz : EV-BT = 50 : 50, 30 : 70 and 10 : 90) and three different annealing temperatures (un-annealed, 60 °C and 80 °C), corresponding to nine different fabrication conditions in total. The current–voltage characteristics and incident photon–electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were measured under dry nitrogen conditions directly after fabrication. The short-circuit current JSC, the open-circuit voltage VOC, the fill factor (FF) and the PCE under 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight are listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 3. The IPCE curves under low-intensity monochromatic illumination are shown in Fig. 4.

It is clear from Fig. 3 that the device characteristics depend on the processing conditions in a fairly complex manner, and trends which apply for one blend composition do not necessarily hold for others. For instance, whilst the short-circuit photocurrent increases steadily with annealing temperature for 90% EV-BT content, at lower EV-BT content it appears to peak at some intermediate temperature between 25 and 80 °C. Nonetheless, some general conclusions may be drawn from the data. All devices with 90% EV-BT content had relatively poor performance, presumably due to the low donor–acceptor interfacial area and insufficient PCz pathways for continuous hole transport. Of the devices studied, those containing 70% EV-BT content displayed the best overall characteristics, yielding the best performance at all three annealing temperatures in terms of JSC, VOC, fill factor and PCE. Reducing the EV-BT content from 70% to 50% resulted in a slight loss of JSC, and a substantial decrease in FF at an annealing temperature of 80 °C. The most efficient device was obtained using 70% EV-BT followed by annealing at 80 °C. This yielded a PCE of 0.75%, a JSC of 1.14 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.36 V and a FF of 49%. The current–voltage curves of the two most efficient devices (devices #5 and #6) under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5. We draw attention to a number of unusual ‘kinks’ (or inflections) in the current–voltage curves in the vicinity of the open-circuit voltage VOC. These inflections are consistent with a model in which an electric field is required to initiate appreciable free carrier generation; the yield of free carriers falls as the built-in potential is approached (and the internal field reduces in strength), giving rise to the observed kinks in the current–voltage response. The interested reader is referred to ref. 14 where we discuss this issue in detail.
The open-circuit voltages of the devices were all 1 V or above, compared to typical values of 0.5 to 1 V for PCBM-based BHJ devices. This is a consequence of the more favourably located −3.6 eV LUMO level of EV-BT compared to the −4.3 eV level of PCBM. High IPCEs (and therefore JSCs) were obtained for all devices with 50% or 70% EV-BT content, and device #6 had a good FF approaching 50%, indicating relatively low losses.
In conclusion, we have reported solar cells with promising performance based on blends of 4,7-bis(2-(1-(2-ethylhexyl)-4,5-dicyanoimidazol-2-yl)vinyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole [EV-BT] and poly[N-(2′-decyltetradecyl)carbazole]-2,7-diyl [PCz]. The most efficient devices combined reasonable power conversion efficiency with a wide operating voltage range. This study was preliminary and the fabrication conditions used here were not fully optimised. From numerous studies on other materials systems, the film morphology is known to have a significant influence on the final photovoltaic performance and—apart from blend composition and annealing temperatures—other factors such as solvent choice and concentration can drastically alter the way donor and acceptor materials phase separate in the film and so greatly influence exciton dissociation and charge transport. In the case of P3HT:PCBM devices, substantial year-on-year improvements in device efficiencies have been achieved as materials quality and processing know-how have improved, and we would envisage similar improvements over time for PCz:EV-BT. Even so, these preliminary results are encouraging and compare very favourably with the small number of solution-processable small molecule acceptor materials reported elsewhere in the literature, which have yielded efficiencies in the range 0.07% to 0.45% with open-circuit voltages less than 1 V at 100 mW cm−2. The highest previously reported efficiency using a (non-fullerene based) solution processable acceptor is 0.63% (obtained from a blend of PCz and perylene tetracarboxydiimide), although this was obtained at a lower light intensity of 10 mW cm−2.
Finally, we note that the PCz:EV-BT combination has considerable potential for improvement through the chemical modification of the PCz donor material to widen the absorption range (see recent work by Blouin and co-workers) and that we have also used EV-BT in combination with a variety of other well-known donor polymers such as P3HT and PQT-12. These studies will be reported in a future manuscript.

‡ The Fermi level of the Ca cathode is expected to pin to the −3.6 eV LUMO level of the acceptor. Hence, the built-in potential is expected to be 1.6 V based on the energy difference between the −5.2 eV work function of PEDOT:PSS and the −3.6 eV LUMO level of EV-BT (this is confirmed experimentally from the zero crossing of the Jph–V curve, where Jph is the difference between the photocurrent Jlight and the dark current Jdark, see ref. 14). Under high illumination levels, the open-circuit voltage is expected to saturate at the built-in potential. Experimentally, the highest obtained open circuit voltage was ∼1.4 eV. This is slightly lower than the built-in potential due to the (subtractive) influence of the dark current and the limited light intensity.
