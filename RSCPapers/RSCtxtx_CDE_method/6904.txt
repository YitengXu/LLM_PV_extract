A series of well-defined D–π-B–A C60 adducts containing three chromophores and their corresponding precursors were facilely developed as organic photovoltaic materials. The photophysical and electrochemical properties indicated that effective photo-induced intramolecular and/or intermolecular energy transfer and charge transfer were formed from the donor chromophores to the C60 moiety in thin films. Solution processed molecular heterojunction solar cells using 12 as active layer were fabricated with 2.0% monochromatic efficiency. Our results showed that further exploration might lead the way toward high-efficient solution-processed single molecular solar cell materials based on conjugated oligomer covalent to fullerene units.

Charge transfer between π-conjugated materials and various dopants has been intensively investigated due to their potential applications in optoelectronic devices, especially in photovoltaic cells. Recently, the concept using the molecular heterojunction in solar cells, in which π-conjugated oligomers are attached covalently to fullerene units, has been considered as a good strategy to control and reproduce the dispersity as well as phase segregation and morphology of these composites in thin films. Moreover, covalent attachment of the donor and acceptor moieties within one molecule allows for a detailed study of the intramolecular charge generation and recombination processes in solution and solid states. However, the power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices based on these heterojunctions is still much lower than those based on π-conjugated polymers due to the drawback of narrower absorption range and relatively lower content of fullerene, which rendered dramatically lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) by rapid charge recombination. Therefore, a favourable way of improving the efficiency of fullerene adducts is to develop new materials containing a relatively high content of fullerene group with high hole/electron mobility, which might exhibit higher efficiency in organic solar cells due to better phase segregation compared to monofullerene adducts.

Along this line, our lab previously reported the synthesis of a series of oligothiophene-functionalized truxene derivatives and the corresponding C60 adducts with excellent yields. As shown in Scheme 1, such D–π-B–A C60 adducts were composed of three chromophores (oligothiophene-functionalized truxene as a tunable donor, N-methylpyrrolidine as bridges, [60]fullerene as an end-capped acceptor). Actually, the first step in a solar cell is the transfer of an electron from the donor to the acceptor after light absorption. For the development of novel materials exhibiting enhanced performance, it is necessary to understand the charge generation and separation processes in detail. To simplify the complicated photophysical process, we choose these molecular C60 adducts as model compounds to study the processes on π-conjugated molecules–fullerene blends solar cell systems. Therefore, herein we report in-depth characterizations on photophysical, electrochemical, and the correlations to their solar cells device performances of our D–π-B–A multifullerene adducts and corresponding precursors in solid states as complementary insights on the effects of various contents of fullerenes and different conjugated lengths of donor. To further prove the concept of molecular heterojunction we also fabricate solution-processed single-component and bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells based on selected thiophene-based conjugated small molecules as donor materials or truxene–oligothiophenes–fullerene triads as molecular heterojunction materials with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The three-branched truxene core not only provides us a platform to investigate modulation of the physical properties of a series of multibranched [60]fullerene adducts with a similar donor part, but also exhibits synergy effect in different D–π-B–A branches and enhances the device efficiency. Based on our initial results, these triad molecules produce power conversion efficiencies up to 0.34% in simulated solar light and 2.0% monochromatic efficiency. The efficiency will be further increased for longer oligothiophenes and optimized device fabrication. We believed that our work on the detailed investigation of its structure–property–device relationship can uncover a new strategy in designing highly efficient organic solar cell materials based on molecular heterojunction systems.

The photophysical properties of these [60]fullerene adducts in solutions were briefly reported in our previous contributions. However, the photophysical properties of [60]fullerene adducts in solid states is much more useful and credible for the fabrication of organic solar cells in thin films. So we investigated the photophysical and electrochemical properties of these compounds in solid state and afforded a direct guideline for further research. Thin films used for UV-vis and photoluminescence measurements were obtained by spin-coating the solution of corresponding compounds (ca. 5 mg per mL) in toluene or 1,2-dichlorobenzene onto quartz plates at 1000 rpm. All compounds exhibited good film-forming properties.

As shown in Fig. 1, a continuous red-shift in the absorption and emission spectra of star-shaped compounds 1–6 in thin films was observed with a successive increase in the number of thiophene or EDOT rings, which is favourable for the application as photovoltaic materials. The absorption spectra of EDOT functionalized truxene 5 and 6 showed a better well-defined vibronic behaviour in comparison with those of 1–4 in thin films. It was also observed that maximum absorption peaks of 5 and 6 were obviously red-shifted in comparison with those of the corresponding compounds 1 and 2 due to the electron donating effect of the ethylenedioxy substituent at the EDOT rings. Moreover, the dramatic red-shift effect from compounds 5 and 6 might be contributed to the intramolecular S–O interaction between adjacent EDOT moieties of 6, which enhanced the planarity in the oligo-EDOT. Further, from compounds 1 to 6, the emission spectra became broader and the shoulder peaks disappeared with the increase in the number of thiophene rings. It indicated that shorter oligothiophene chains had a better and more regular order than longer ones. Therefore, all these preliminary results demonstrated that the photophysical properties of these precursors in ground and excited states were liable to be modulated by changing the oligothiophene branch.
The C60 adducts series, 7, 8, and 9 owned the same conjugated bridge and brought with the different numbers of C60. Fig. 2 shows that their absorption maximum λmax was almost the same with the increase of the content of C60, but the characteristic absorption peak of C60 at around 270 nm in all spectra was enhanced as the content of the C60 moieties increased while the spectra were normalized at about 343 nm. However, for 12 with the longest oligothiophene chain, the absorption λmax in solids obviously red-shifted from about 345 nm to 445 nm compared to 9. Furthermore, all C60 adducts also exhibited a broad and weak absorption peak at around 712 nm. The results demonstrated that there was no significant intramolecular electronic communication or charge-transfer interaction in solid state between the fullerenes and the donor part through the pyrrolidine segments in the ground state. For these C60 adducts, the emission intensity from donor chromophores was strongly decreased, which showed significant intramolecular electronic communication between the oligothiophene functionalized truxene and N-methylfulleropyrrolidine moieties in excited states. We observed that the emission of the donor chromophore almost completely quenched for all C60 adducts in the solid states. The emission light intensity was quite poor (less than 10) for all adducts. Moreover, the emission intensity around 750–850 nm belonging to N-methylfulleropyrrolidine moieties was also extremely weak. The results suggested the effective occurrence of intramolecular and/or intermolecular energy transfer and charge transfer from the donor chromophores to the C60 groups in solid state. Therefore, we selected the C60 adducts with three N-methylfulleropyrrolidine moieties for photovoltaic cells due to the relatively higher content of fullerene and structural symmetry, which promoted well ordered inter-chain packing and improved charge carrier mobility.
A few results were reported on the electrochemical property of C60 adducts in solid states in the previous literature. Therefore, the HOMO–LUMO energy level and the corresponding band gap of these C60 adducts as well as precursors in thin films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. 3, The cyclic voltammetric spectra of compounds 2–4 show relative reversible oxidation wave in comparison with compounds 1 and 5 with shorter oligothiophene chains, which indicated that the electrochemical stability of our star-shaped molecules would be better with increasing the number of thiophene groups. Moreover, the onset position of the oxidation process continuously negative-shifted with extending of the conjugated system, especially for compound 6 due to the stronger electron donating effect of the alkoxy group and induced higher HOMO levels. HOMO levels of thin films were determined based on the onset positions of the oxidation peaks, using the equation: 
EHOMO = −e (4.71 + Eox(onset)) (eV)
(1)
Since it was difficult to get a good reduction wave, the LUMO levels can be inferred from the oxidation potential and the optical energy band gap calculated earlier, although this is somewhat different from the corresponding optical band gap (neutral excited states) and electrochemical band gap (free ions) due to the different measurement states. Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical data of our precursor molecules. These results also revealed that HOMO levels were raised and LUMO levels were reduced as the length of the conjugated oligothiophene unit was increased. These results are consistent with UV-Vis absorption spectra mentioned above.

The relevant and electrochemical data of the C60 adducts series are listed in Table 1 and a representative cyclic voltammetry response, obtained from 7, 8, and 9 in thin films, is displayed in Fig. 4. All compounds showed irreversible oxidation features, which were assigned to the formation of the truxene–thiophene cation radical. Moreover, the introduction of more terminal N-methylfulleropyrrolidine groups produced a small positive shift of anodic peak and onset position. The positive shift might be related to the enhancement of acceptor content, which render the compound slightly difficult to be oxidized. The cyclic voltammograms of 9, 10, 11, and 12, which had three C60 groups with different oligothiophene chains, successively negative-shifted the oxidation wave due to the increase in chain length of oligothiophene groups. As general features on the reduction side, the cyclic voltammograms of these multiple fullerene compounds in thin films exhibit two or three broad quasi-reversible cathodic waves associated with the reduction of fullerene components compared to the reversible reduction process in solution as described in the literature. It might be caused by the lower diffusion coefficient of more fulleropyrrolidine groups in solid state, which led them to move slowly to the surface of the electrode. From these Ered(onset) and Eox(onset) the HOMO and LUMO and the bandgap of the C60 adducts were calculated using eqn (1) as listed below
LUMO = −e(Ered(onset) + 4.71) (eV)
(2)
Eg(cv) = −e(Eox(onset) − Ered(onset)) (eV)

The investigation demonstrated that C60 adducts can be easily oxidized or reduced, which might indicate ambipolar charge transport for this type of molecule. Although the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these C60 adducts were significantly changed by introduction of the fullerene groups in comparison with the energy levels of PCBM, it is still possible that there is photoinduced intermolecular charge transfer between C60 adducts and PCBM. These results showed that our precursors and C60 adducts both had promising electrochemical properties as donor materials in organic solar cells.
Increasing the content of fullerene segments in C60 adducts is beneficial to the energy and electron transfer processes. To verify the assumption and test the application of our C60 adducts for photo-electronic energy conversion devices, we first selected molecular heterojunction compound 12 to fabricate the single-component solar cells because it has relatively broader absorption spectra and a relatively higher number of fullerene segments. The simplified configuration of devices (ITO–PEDOT:PSS–12–Al) would figure out the problem of phase separation. In our experiments, we employed 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a solvent because it had better solubility than chlorobenzene for both C60 adducts and PCBM. Under 100 mW cm−2 white-light illumination, a Jsc of 0.30 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.50 V were observed for this type of device. So the overall white light conversion efficiency was calculated to be 0.04%. It was surprising that in the type of the solar cells made of pure films of the corresponding precursor 4 without C60 terminal groups as the active layer, the power conversion efficiency was two orders smaller than that of the cell based on 12. It is also worth mentioning that the monochromatic efficiency was reasonably high (2.0% at 473 nm). Although the performance of single component solar cells was not as good as that of the conjugated oligomer–fullerene blended systems, the results indicated that the bicontinuous network of donor chromophores and N-methylfulleropyrrolidine groups was indeed formed in the active layer with sole [60]fullerene adduct 12. Notably, the thickness of the active layer is only 50 nm due to the solubility of 12, the power conversion efficiency of the device based on 12 could be enhanced further if we can improve its solubility to make the active layer thicker. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5, another drawback for low mobility of electrons in the acceptor phase is the far lower content of fullerene groups in 12 compared with the normal weight content of PCBM (up to 80 wt%) in bulk-heterojunction solar cells, which rendered the film of the pure 12 obviously less smooth surface in AFM images than those of bulk-heterojunction films with PCBM. As compared with the devices built by vacuum vapor deposition techniques using mono- or multilayers of small organic molecules doped with PCBM, our [60]fullerene adduct 12 has the advantage of the solution process and using a single layer without doping the PCBM layer as well as avoiding the phase separation. Our results demonstrate that well-defined monodisperse photovoltaic materials with end-capping fulleropyrrolidine have exhibited the unique properties as single components in the active layer.
To increase the relative content of fullerene groups in our [60]fullerene adduct and enhance the electron mobility in single component solar cells, 50 wt% and 80 wt% PCBM was added to the photoactive layer. The performance of the devices dramatically improved up to 0.27% for 50 wt% PCBM and 0.34% for 80 wt% PCBM. Interesting, as shown in Fig. 6, a power conversion efficiency of 0.27% based on corresponding precursor 4 and 80 wt% PCBM was achieved, which was still lower than that of [60]fullerene adducts 12. These results encouraged us to investigate other typical [60]fullerene adducts 11 and 13 as well as corresponding precursors 3 and 6 without [60]fullerene terminal groups under similar device configuration (ITO–PEDOT:PSS–C60 adducts:PCBM–Al) with 80 wt% PCBM. Table 2 lists the photovoltaic properties obtained from the J–V curves. All devices gave photovoltaic responses due to low fill factors (0.25–0.35) and low open circuit voltages (Voc) (0.35–0.75 V). The main differences in device performances based on our molecules stem from the short circuit current density (Jsc). For the precursors 3, 4, and 6 series, Jsc of 4 was two times more than 3, which was attributed to the obvious red-shift of the absorption band; however, the device performance of 6 decreased about 75% compared with 4 due to a relatively higher HOMO level and lower open circuit voltages (Voc) by oligo-EDOT segments. For three star-shaped C60 adducts, Jsc of 11 decreased to about 50% in comparison with 12 due to the narrow absorption band. Notably, all of the C60 adducts showed much better device performance compared with the corresponding non-functionalized precursor, which indicated that fullerene-based molecules as donor materials might improve the intermiscibility of donor–acceptor and reduce charge recombination. In summary, precursor 4 and corresponding C60 adduct 12 had relatively higher device performances among our molecules, because they might have a longer conjugation length and higher absorption coefficient than other compounds.

In conclusion, we have developed a family of D–π-B–A [60]fullerene adducts and their corresponding precursors for photovoltaic cells materials. The fluorescence of fulleropyrrolidine adducts has been completely quenched in thin films. The results demonstrate that photoinduced intramolecular and/or intermolecular energy and electron transfer from the donor chromophores to the C60 groups have been formed in solid state. A single-component photovoltaic cell based on 12 was fabricated and the monochromatic efficiency at about 473 nm is 2.0%, which is moderate monochromatic performance for a solution processed single component solar cell based on a conjugated oligomer covalent to fullerene. All of the C60 adducts showed a much better device performance compared with the corresponding non-functionalized precursor when they were mixed with PCBM in solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells. It turns out that our tris[60]fullerene adducts have improved the electron transport due to multiple fullerene groups. The results seem to warrant further exploration and possibly lead the way toward efficient single-molecular organic solar cell materials containing multifullerene molecules. Further improvements will be expected by the utilization of higher content of fullerene adducts with a low band gap donor or good self-organization ability.


UV-vis spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-vis Spectrometer. PL spectra were carried out on a PerkinElmer LS55 Luminescence Spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed using BASi EC epsilon workstation; scan rate: 100 mV s−1; working electrode: Pt disc; auxiliary electrode: Pt wire; reference electrode: Ag/AgNO3; supporting electrolyte Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M, CH3CN). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed with a Multimode AFM (Veeco Instruments, Santa Barbara) equipped with a 10 μm × 10 μm (E) scanner and a Nanoscope IIIa controller using OMCL-AC160TS silicon cantilevers (Olympus, resonance frequency: 300 kHz and spring constant: 42 N m−1) using far-off resonance tapping-mode imaging.

The single layer bulk heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with indium tin oxide (ITO) glass anode and metal cathode. A thin layer (40 nm) of Baytron PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate)) was spin-coated on the ITO glass in 50 °C preheat treatment. Subsequently, the photosensitive active layer was prepared by spin coating the blend of 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of our fullerene adducts or precursors and PCBM (1:4, 1:1, 1:0 w/w) on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Samples were dried in Petri dishes under a N2 atmosphere without any heating treatment. Al metal was then thermally deposited onto the dried organic layer at a pressure around 4–6 ×10−4 Pa. The active area of the device was 0.15 cm2. The current–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2.
