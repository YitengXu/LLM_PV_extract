A new kind of PDMS–urea co-polymer has been synthesized and successfully incorporated into the fabrication process of perovskite solar cells. Such a polymer possesses both a flexible and hydrophobic PDMS backbone and urea groups capable of hydrogen binding. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the perovskite layer was greatly improved after addition of 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea into perovskite precursor solution. As a result, the short circuit current of the devices was improved by 10% and the energy conversion efficiency by 27%, reaching 16.15% under 1 sun simulated sunlight. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra reveal a much improved photoluminescence intensity after the introduction of PDMS–urea into the perovskite layer. The devices with the perovskite-PDMS–urea (20 mg ml−1) hybrid demonstrate an almost unchanged efficiency for 2500 h, proving its remarkable effect on improving the stability of perovskite solar cells.

Lead trihalogen perovskites have attracted considerable attention as photoabsorbers for solar cell applications. This field has been expanding rapidly and the certified highest efficiencies have now reached 22.1%. Constructing a highly crystallized perovskite thin film without defects is the key to obtain a typical perovskite solar cell with satisfactory photovoltaic properties. Furthermore, a well-defined grain structure, full surface coverage, and small surface roughness are essential aspects for high quality perovskite layers. Although solution-processed methods are widely used in making planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE), the long-term stability of the cells is very poor in most cases, because lead halide perovskite materials are very sensitive to ambient humidity and easily dissolve and degrade in humid environments. It was postulated that moisture dissolves CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and deprotonates MA+ cations. The decomposition process of perovskites occurs by forming intermediates of [(MA+)n−1(CH3NH2)PbI3][H3O+]. Therefore, it is very challenging to develop ultra-stable PCE devices with high resistance to hostile operation environments.

Recently, polymers as an additive in perovskite solar cells have attracted more attention, not only because their flexible long chains can help the formation of an ideal film morphology, but also the addition of polymers in the precursor can improve the stability of the obtained devices. Su for the first time showed the usage of 1 wt% of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in a perovskite layer, leading to a 25% increase in its PCE at a value of 13.2%. The coverage and morphology control of perovskite films on TiO2 were greatly optimized by the addition of PEG. Yu has shown that PEG with an appropriate molecular weight can provide perovskite layers with strong humidity-resistance and self-healing behaviour. Unencapsulated devices retain a high output for up to 300 h in a highly humid environment by using a PEG additive in perovskite precursor solutions. Liu incorporated a small amount of polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene polymer P(VDF-TrFE) into PbI2 solution to control the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite layers in a two-step deposition process, resulting in a nearly 31% increase of device PCE. Very recently, Grätzel et al. reported a certified PCE of 21.02% by adding poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a template to control the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite films. These findings make a myriad of polymers ideal candidates for improving the performance of perovskite solar cells. Table 1 summarizes the recent progress in the application of polymer additives in perovskite layers and their impact on the perovskite films and device stability. Although there is increasing interest in the development of perovskite solar cells with polymer additives for the improvement of both the film morphology and device stability, only a few types of polymers have been employed in solution-processed methods. In particular, no reports so far have shown a polymer additive based device attained stability of more than 1500 h with desirable efficiency, making this type of perovskite solar cell far from practical application. Therefore, more potential candidates are still needed to facilitate the development of perovskite solar cells with both high efficiency and long-term stability.

In this study, we design and synthesize a co-block polymer poly(dimethylsiloxane)–urea (PDMS–urea) and use it as an additive in perovskite precursor solution, significantly improving the obtained perovskite solar cells in terms of both PCE and stability. The design of the co-block is based on two criteria: firstly, the urea moieties could have strong interaction with CH3NH3PbI3 through hydrogen bonding which may help the crystalline formation of the perovskite film; secondly, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) domain of the polymer provides hydrophobic and flexible chains which may protect the perovskite film from moisture invasion. Moreover, this particular polymer is chemically modifiable, providing a potential opportunity to tune the perovskite film morphology as well as the surface coverage of the thin films. Our results showed that the PCE of perovskite solar cells can achieve more than 27% improvement after optimizing the amount of polymer additive, reaching 16.15% at 100 mW cm−2 simulated irradiation, which is among the highest reported efficiencies for polymer additive-based perovskite solar cells. The devices with the perovskite-PDMS–urea hybrid demonstrate an almost unchanged efficiency for 2500 h, proving its remarkable effect on improving the stability of the perovskite solar cells, which is far better than that of state-of-the-art devices (PMMA-based perovskite solar cells stabilizing within 2 months (ref. 20)). Our results indicate that there is tremendous potential to develop functional co-polymers for perovskite solar cells with both high efficiency and long-term stability.

The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass was from NGC, Japan. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Lumtech Corp. Taiwan and used as received. PbI2 (purity: 99.98%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Aminopropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (H2N-PDMS-NH2) with molecular weights of 850, 2500 and 5000 and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as such.


Aminopropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (H2N-PDMS-NH2) with the molecular weights of 850, 2500 and 5000 was used. Taking the H2N-PDMS-NH2 of 2500 molecular weight as an example, the H2N-PDMS-NH2 (2.500 g, 1 mmol) was added dropwise to IPDI (0.222 g, 1 mmol) in chloroform (15 ml) under stirring at room temperature. After addition, the obtained homogeneous liquid was heated to reflux and reacted for another 6 hours. The solvent was then removed under vacuum.


The FTO conductive glass was washed with detergent, deionized water and isopropanol sequentially in a sonication bath for 10 min, respectively. This cleaned glass was dried by blowing air with an air gun and then was etched by using a laser cutting machine. c-TiO2 was prepared by spray pyrolysis. Typically, 75% was diluted with isopropanol in a volume ratio of 1:9. The FTO glass substrate was heated up to 450 °C for 20 min before the spray process was carried out. After cooling to room temperature, the c-TiO2-glass was cut into 1 cm by 2 cm by area and transferred into a glovebox filled with inert N2. Perovskite precursor solution was prepared by adding 578 mg PbI2, 200 mg CH3NH3I (the molar ratio is 1:1) and different amounts of PDMS–urea in 1 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), followed by heating at 50 °C in an oven overnight. Hole conductive spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by adding 83.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 15.62 μl Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg ml−1 LiTFSI acetonitrile solution) and 16.88 μl tetrabutyl pyridine in 1 ml chlorobenzene and mixing completely. A dense and uniform perovskite layer was fabricated by dropping 25 μl perovskite precursor solution onto c-TiO2-glass and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. After 5 s once the spin coating process started, 150 μl chlorobenzene was added immediately onto the perovskite film. The films were then heated at 100 °C for 10 min to form brownish black mirror-like perovskite films. After cooling to room temperature, the hole transfer solution was spun onto the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The devices were completed by thermal evaporation of 60 μm thick Au back contact electrodes.


FT-IR was carried out by using a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer (resolution = 4 cm−1, 32 scans). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the copolymer samples was performed by ramping from 20 °C to 800 °C at 20 °C min−1 using a TGA Q5000. Water contact angles on the polymer films were measured by using a goniometer (CAM 101, KSV Instruments) under ambient conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Rigaku D/MAX 2400 diffractometer (Cu Kα) with a scan rate of 5° min−1 under operation conditions of 40 kV and 150 mA. UV-vis spectra of the perovskite films were recorded by using an Agilent UV-vis spectrophotometer (model Cary 60). A Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 10 kV was employed to characterize the morphologies of the samples and the cross section of the devices. The I–V curves were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). A NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-2 filter was used to adjust light intensity into 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). A black mask with an area of 0.15 cm−2 was used for the measurement. Steady-state PL spectra were measured on a steady-state fluorescence spectrofluorometer (model QM/TM/IM, PTI) with a 530 nm photoluminescent dye for excitation at room temperature, with poly(methyl methacrylate) as a protective layer for perovskite films. The devices with different PDMS–urea amounts were stored in the dark under ambient conditions and tested at intervals to record their stability performance. The thicknesses of the perovskite films were measured by using a profilometer (Bruker, DektakXT). Atomic force microscopy was conducted using a MFP-3D-SA (Oxford Instruments Asylum Research Inc) with a tapping mode. The conductivities of the perovskite films were determined by using a two-contact electrical conductivity set-up, following a published procedure.



Fig. 1 shows schematically the preparation of a perovskite thin film with a PDMS–urea additive. The molecular weight of PDMS–urea we used here is 2500. Briefly, the perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto compact TiO2-FTO glass and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Chlorobenzene was added in the middle onto the perovskite films as an anti-solvent to realize fast crystallization of perovskite grains, followed by heating at 100 °C for 10 min to form brownish black mirror-like perovskite films. These films were then subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Fig. 2 shows the top-view SEM images of perovskite films fabricated with PDMS–urea additions of 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg ml−1. The first three images (Fig. 2a–c) show good surface coverage as well as compacted perovskite crystals. In spite of this, differences can also be observed among them. The perovskite films with the 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea additive show an increased average grain size compared to the pristine and 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea-added perovskite films. In addition, a 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea addition shows blurred crystal boundaries, which is a clear sign of PDMS–urea covering the grains of the perovskite films. The addition of a higher concentration of PDMS–urea (20 mg ml−1) induces a great number of small grains with the average size less than 100 nm. The incomplete surface coverage and the increase of the surface roughness indicate a retardation of the crystallinity of the perovskite crystals caused by a large amount of PDMS–urea addition. The mechanism regarding how the polymer contributes to a smooth and highly crystalline perovskite film is yet to be known, but it may be related to the changed reaction kinetics of the PbI2 and CH3NH2I and/or crystallization kinetics. The PDMS–urea inducement of nucleation leads to many small nuclei, while at a high PDMS–urea concentration (20 mg ml−1), the existence of PDMS–urea between perovskite grains retards the Ostwald ripening process during thermal annealing, making perovskites hard to form large crystals. Fig. 2e shows the mapping of the Si element within the perovskite film as Si is only from PDMS–urea. The image clearly demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea in the mixed perovskite film.

The chemical structure of PDMS–urea is shown in Scheme 1. Dimethylsiloxane and carbamide are bridged by an R group (here R = isophorone) to form a copolymer. Two functions can be expected from this unique chemical structure. First, the N atoms in CH3NH2I can interact with H atoms from the hydroxyl group via hydrogen bonding. This can be proved by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum characterization (Fig. S1), where the CO stretching vibration from PDMS–urea is shifted from 1630 cm−1 to 1637 cm−1 after been mixed with perovskites. In addition, the I atoms from PbI2 can also interact with the O atoms from carbamide. The localization of these reagent molecules can assist the formation of large-sized perovskite crystals in the film and the ideal distance of these chemical bonds may allow adjacent PbI2 and CH3NH2I to react with each other. As a result, the underlying mechanism is probably related to the weak binding between CH3NH2I and PbI2 during the film formation process. Second, the polymer backbone is super flexible and very hydrophobic to moisture due to the introduction of the dimethylsiloxane chain (the contact angle of the polymer membrane is 107 ± 3° as is shown in Fig. S2). The good coverage of PDMS–urea over perovskite grains is supposed to effectively prevent moisture from interacting with the perovskite active layer, and thus improves the stability of the devices (as discussed below). Therefore, the careful design of the PDMS–urea chemical structure could promise the enhancement of the cohesive and smooth morphology of the perovskite film that forms a layer on top of the TiO2 layer, while maintaining a very good protection of the perovskite layer from moisture. Thermal gravity analysis (TGA, Fig. S3) reveals that PDMS–urea can be processed at the temperature of 200 °C, higher than that of the MAPbI3 thermal annealing process temperature.
In Fig. 3a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows a typical MAPbI3 tetragonal perovskite structure with I4cm symmetry and a high phase purity, which matches well with the results reported in other studies. The strong Bragg peaks at 14.08, 28.41, and 31.85° can be indexed to the (110), (220), and (310) diffractions of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal (all the diffraction patterns were plotted at the same intensity scale). Notably, no peaks were observed for PDMS–urea, indicating its amorphous nature. The diffraction peak at 14.1° is also shown in Fig. 3b; the intensity decreases upon increase of the PDMS–urea content. The sample with 5 mg ml−1 and 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea addition shows a similar intensity as the pristine perovskite, while that with the highest PDMS–urea addition shows a dramatically lowered intensity. The result indicates that the addition of a small amount of PDMS–urea does not affect the crystallinity of perovskite films, while the addition of a larger amount is detrimental for the formation of perovskite crystals. The XRD results agree perfectly with those from SEM analysis.
The UV-vis spectra of MAPbI3 films with PDMS–urea in Fig. 4 all show efficient panchromatic light absorption capability (from near UV to near infrared regions) with a band edge around 780 nm. The presence of PDMS–urea increases the loading of the perovskite on the TiO2 compact layer, which improves light harvesting within the perovskite network. However, too much PDMS–urea additive will increase the thickness of the PDMS–urea layer on the perovskite grains, weakening the light absorption of the perovskite films. Notably, PDMS–urea itself does not absorb any light in the measuring region, as can be recognized from the nearly flat UV-vis curve at 0.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra can be informative with regard to charge recombination and transfer. The emission of the perovskite material is from the recombination of the excitons within the films provided that no charge selective layer is applied. As shown in Fig. 5, the perovskite film with a 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea additive shows a significantly enhanced PL compared to the pristine film. This is an indication that the non-radiative carrier recombination has been effectively retarded. We ascribe this effect to the PDMS–urea-assisted growth of large and well-ordered perovskite crystals, as has been evidenced above by SEM and XRD analyses.
The photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells with various PDMS–urea additions were characterized and the results are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 6. The statistical analysis of all these devices is summarized in Fig. S5. The device structure is denoted as glass/FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/perovskite-PDMS–urea/spiro-OMeTAD/Au with an active area of 0.15 cm2. The thicknesses of all the perovskite films are comparable (about 385 ± 4 nm, characterized by using the profilometer). The devices fabricated with a pristine perovskite layer exhibited an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 971 mV, a short circuit current (JSC) of 19.80 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.66 and a PCE of 12.68% at 1 sun light intensity. Upon addition of 5 and 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea, the device showed an increase of both VOC and JSC. The highest PCE of the cells with 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea addition was 16.15%, with a VOC of 1031 mV, a JSC of 21.73 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.72. By further increasing the amount of PDMS–urea to 20 mg ml−1, the JSC of the device remained almost the same; however, the VOC decreased and the PCE decreased to 13.77%. The addition of the polymer into perovskite solar cells does not eliminate hysteresis (Fig. 6c and d), probably due to the existence of ion motion within the film.

The introduction of an appropriate amount of PDMS–urea can retard the aggregation of perovskite crystals and can help neck the perovskite domains, avoiding formation of any vacancy during the evolution of perovskite films. At the same time, the size of the perovskite crystals can be enlarged. These are of great significance as the pinhole-free perovskite layer and large perovskite crystals are key to high efficiency devices, which help facilitate charge migration and minimize any current leakage and direct contact between TiO2 and the hole transport layer. As a result, an increase of JSC from 19.80 mA cm−2 to 21.73 mA cm−2 with 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea was obtained. Meanwhile, the VOC of the device is improved from 971 mV to 1031 V. To understand how the addition of PDMS–urea prevents the current leakage of the solar cells, dark current measurement was conducted. As can be found in Fig. S4, the dark I–V curves demonstrate that the addition of PDMS–urea shows reduced current leakage compared to that without the PDMS–urea additive in the perovskite film. It is highly because of its effective morphology control during the preparation of the perovskite films, agreeing with above discussions. However, the insulating properties of PDMS–urea would block the charge transfer in the perovskite layer if the concentration of PDMS–urea was increased. The charges cannot effectively transport to either the TiO2 nanoparticles or the spiro-OMeTAD layer and would accumulate or recombine in the perovskite layer. Therefore, both the JSC and VOC are decreased. The photovoltaic parameters can also be well explained from the SEM images shown in Fig. 2d. The discontinuity of the perovskite layer would provide more opportunities for charge recombination at voids between the perovskite grains.
We further determined the photovoltaic effect of molecular weight (Mw) of PDMS–urea in the perovskite layer (10 mg ml−1 in precursor solution). Three different Mw (850, 2500, and 5000) were chosen for this study. As illustrated in Table 3, the lowest Mw 850 yields a VOC of 999 mV. This value increases as the Mw increases, while JSC shows a first increase and then a decrease. We assume that, compared to the Mw 850, the Mw 2500 provides a sufficiently flexible scaffold to promote the formation of large-crystallized perovskites effectively. However, the Mw 5000 introduces a more rigid framework, which could retard the electron transport within the perovskite film. We used an atomic force microscope (AFM) to prove our hypothesis. From the AFM images in Fig. S6, we can find out that when the molecular weight of PDMS–urea is 850, the perovskite grains are densely packed, but the average grain size is smaller. When the molecular weight of PDMS–urea is 2500, although the film surface is a little bit rougher, an obvious increase of the average perovskite grain size can be easily observed. This will lead to decrease of the grain boundaries and enable effective charge migration. When the molecular weight of PDMS–urea is 5000, the particles become loosely packed with a widened particle gap, which could be the reason for the loss of JSC and FF of the devices due to the increased internal resistance. The RMS values for pristine, 850, 2500 and 5000-additives are 11.93, 8.67, 13.11, and 17.95 nm, respectively. Therefore, the compromised result of both the surface roughness and crystal size leads to the best photovoltaic performance of PSCs when combined with PDMS–urea with an Mw of 2500.

The insulating PDMS–urea scaffold structure can stabilize the PSCs in humid environments due to its strong hygroscopic properties. In our study, three groups of unencapsulated devices were prepared without and with PDMS–urea (two concentrations), respectively. Fig. 7 shows the variation of the PCE of the three groups of devices as a function of time in the dark under 50% relative humidity without any encapsulation. In contrast to the fast PCE decay of the pristine PSCs from 100% to less than 60% within the first 168 h, those with the PDMS–urea additive showed a much improved stability. This is probably due to the equilibrium distribution of the polymer/perovskite hybrid film contacting with both hole and electron transport layers. The devices with 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea showed a first increase of the PCE by 30% of the original PCE in 96 h aging and then a slight decrease afterwards, but a drastic drop after 1600 h. This is because of the drop of the JSC and FF. We assume that the PDMS–urea scaffold may have collapsed after a long aging period test, making perovskite grains difficult to communicate with each other. This will result in the charge carriers within the perovskite film hard to transfer, significantly decreasing the JSC and FF. The device with a PDMS–urea concentration of 20 mg ml−1 showed the best stability performance, demonstrating no degradation within the entire study period of more than 2500 h. This is because more PDMS–urea can form a more compact layer, enhancing the moisture resistance of the devices. As has been mentioned before, the contact angle of a water drop on the surface of the polymer film is 107 ± 3°, indicating the hydrophobicity of PDMS–urea.
We also tested the evolution of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the cells without and with 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea in the perovskite films. The gradual drop in the IPCE values for the pristine PSC in Fig. S7 indicates that significant charge recombination occurs within the solar cells during the testing period, while quite similar IPCE curves were observed for PSCs with the PDMS–urea additive. To give further robust evidence, we examined the evolution of the conductivity of the perovskite films with and without PDMS–urea additive (Fig. S8). The perovskite films were cast on top of plain glass, followed by thermal evaporation of a thin Au layer and stored under the exact conditions as devices. The conductivity of the film with the PDMS–urea additive is almost unchanged, suggesting that the recombination of the charge carriers within the film is not significant. While for the films without the PDMS–urea additive, the conductivity decreased over time. The enhanced stability may be due to the hydrogen bonding offered by PDMS–urea between perovskite precursors, as has been observed by Hsieh. The stability test is still in progress.

In conclusion, we have prepared a perovskite layer embedded with a hydrophobic polymer PDMS–urea as an additive and incorporated it into the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. The co-polymerized PDMS–urea polymer with dimethylsiloxane and carbamide in the backbone can improve both the morphology of the perovskite layer and the stability of the devices. Particularly, the hydrophobicity of PDMS–urea effectively prevents moisture from contacting with the perovskite layer. Perovskite solar cells incorporated with 10 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea into the perovskite layer resulted in a highest efficiency of 16.15% at 100 mW cm−2 simulated irradiation, a 27% increment compared with that of pristine perovskite solar cells. More importantly, the devices with 20 mg ml−1 PDMS–urea demonstrated an almost unchanged efficiency during a testing period of more than 2500 h, while the efficiency of the pristine perovskite based devices dropped to 40% of the original value within only 168 h. We believe that this kind of polymer is a promising candidate for devices fabricated on flexible substrates, as it can be chemically modified, e.g., the fine-tuning of the proportion of dimethylsiloxane and carbamide in the backbone will change the flexibility as well as the hydrophobicity.
