In this study, we report on an internal magnetic field effect, originating from magnetic γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed into nanocrystalline TiO2 film, which improves the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The DSSCs based on γ-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite photoelectrode at an optimal amount of ∼1.5 wt% γ-Fe2O3 NPs exhibit an energy conversion efficiency of 6.92%, which is increased by 18% compared to that of DSSCs based on pure TiO2 photoelectrode (5.84%). The role of the magnetic property of γ-Fe2O3 NPs on the PCE of DSSCs is investigated. It is found that the internal magnetic field, originating from the γ-Fe2O3 NPs in the TiO2 electrodes, is the key factor leading to the improved photogenerated electron transfer ability and reduced charge recombination.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received widespread attention due to their high efficiency, low cost and simple preparation over the last 20 years. Typically, DSSCs consist of a dye-sensitized porous TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide redox couple, and a platinized counter electrode. Among these parts, the photoanode properties are critical to determine the efficiency of DSSCs. Most recent studies of the photoanode have been focused on optimizing materials and structures for improving the performance of DSSCs. However, despite these improvements, further investigations from different aspects are still required to advance the use of DSSCs.

Recently, magnetic-field effects have drawn strong interest because of their wonderful potential applications ranging from catalysis to electronics and energy. Applying a weak external magnetic field was explored as an alternative strategy for enhancing the short-circuit current (Jsc) and light-conversion efficiency of solar cells. Shakya et al. reported that the photocurrent of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices could be improved about 9% at a modest magnetic field of ∼15 mT mainly due to the increase in the rate of intersystem crossing, resulting in the increase of net efficiency of exciton dissociation. It is known that the dissociated excitons generate coulomb-bound electron–hole pairs and then separate into free charge carriers, which could contribute to the photocurrent. Lei et al. described a similar enhancement of the photocurrent under applied magnetic field for OPV. This method has been used in OPV but has rarely been reported for dye-sensitized solar cells. In our previous work, we found that the effect of an external magnetic field as low as 45 mT is sufficient to increase the photocurrent in the TiO2-based DSSCs, and the performance of DSSCs can also be affected by external magnetic fields. These results reveal that applying a weak magnetic field can change the photocurrent of solar cells by varying the injection performance and charge transport resistance involved in excited processes and charge transport. In addition, Yang et al. investigated polymer electrolytes containing magnetic Co3O4 and NiO nanoparticles (NPs) for solid-state DSSCs applications under external magnetic field treatment and observed an improved electron transfer process and photoelectric performance in the devices.
In this study, we introduce magnetic γ-Fe2O3 NPs into the photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells to increase efficiency with the Fe2O3 NPs-induced magnetic field effect. The purpose of the present study is to show how to achieve greater efficiency using an internal magnetic field provided by the γ-Fe2O3 NPs dispersed in TiO2 film, which eliminates the need for an external magnetic field.

γ-Fe2O3 NPs were synthesized by a coprecipitation method. Briefly, FeSO4 (2.03 g) and FeCl3 (1.39 g) were dissolved in deionized water (50 ml) and stirred for 1 h. Then, NaOH solution (1.0 M) was rapidly added dropwise until the pH value of the mixed solution was 12.0 and then stirred vigorously at 50 °C for 1 h. The as-prepared precipitate was collected by magnetic separation, washed with deionized water several times, and finally dried in vacuum at 50 °C for 4 h. The dried powder of the precursor was heated in air at 250 °C for 2 h. After the furnace was cooled to room temperature, the γ-Fe2O3 product was obtained.


The commercial TiO2 NPs (P25, Degussa) were first dispersed in α-terpineol and ethyl cellulose under stirring and a viscous paste was obtained after about 10 h. Then, a varying amount of γ-Fe2O3 NPs was added into the TiO2 pastes under vigorous stirring for 24 h at room temperature. To confirm the effect of the magnetic material, the weight percentages of γ-Fe2O3 NPs in the composite films were 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 10 wt%. The photoanode films were fabricated by a screen-printing technique to deposit the prepared paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass) glass substrate. Subsequently, the FTO glasses coated with TiO2 films were sintered in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 1 h. The heated electrodes were impregnated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution in a water-saturated desiccator at 70 °C for 30 min and then recalcined at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the prepared films were immersed into 3 × 10−4 M N719 dye in ethanol solution for 24 h at room temperature. The dye-sensitized samples were then washed with ethanol to remove unanchored dye and dried at 60 °C in an oven. The thickness of the film was estimated to be ∼11 μm. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 (0.04 M in isopropanol) on FTO at 380 °C for 30 min. The prepared photoanode and the counter electrode were appropriately spaced and sealed using a hot-melt film (60 μm in thickness, Dupont, Surlyn 1702) as a sandwich spacer. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidinium isothiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The sealed DSSCs were used for the photocurrent–voltage test with an active area of 0.25 cm2. The configuration of the assembled DSSCs with magnetic γ-Fe2O3 NPs is shown schematically in Fig. 1.


The microstructure of the samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM 2100F). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an automated X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2500, Rigaku, Japan). The magnetic properties of the samples were characterized by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Quantum Design, MPMS (SQUID) VSM system) at 300 K. The UV-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were measured by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901) equipped with an integrating sphere. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics were derived with a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under a Newport solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter for illumination (100 mW cm−2). The incident-light intensity was determined using a calibrated Si reference cell. Incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) spectra were performed using a commercial setup (QTest Station 2000/Crowntech). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured by means of a Zennium electrochemical workstation (Zahner) at open-circuit voltage under AM 1.5 solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range 0.01–100 kHz. The open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) spectra were also recorded by an electrochemical work station after the simulated sunlight was turned off. The amount of dye loaded on each photoanode was checked by desorbing the dye from the photoanode into 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution and measuring the UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye solution.


Fig. 2a shows the TEM image of the Fe2O3 NPs. As clearly seen from the TEM image, the synthesized γ-Fe2O3 NPs are relatively homogeneous structures with a mean particle size of 20 nm. Fig. 2b presents the XRD patterns of Fe2O3. All the detected diffraction peaks can be indexed in the cubic spinel structure of maghemite (JCPDS no. 39-1346) for γ-Fe2O3. The magnetic properties of the as-synthesized γ-Fe2O3 NPs were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer at 300 K. The isothermal hysteresis loop of γ-Fe2O3 NPs is presented in Fig. 2c, indicating a ferromagnetism with a coercivity of 0.13 kOe, powders remanent magnetization of 3.8 emu g−1, and saturation magnetization of 16.61 emu g−1.

Fig. 3 depicts the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs using pure TiO2 and composite photoanodes containing different γ-Fe2O3 amount of 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 10 wt%. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Table 1. As can be seen compared to the pristine TiO2, the DSSCs using γ-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite photoanodes exhibit enhancement of PCE with an increase of the γ-Fe2O3 NPs content from 1 wt% to 3 wt%, and then PCE decreases with further increase of the content to 10 wt%. As the γ-Fe2O3 amount increases to 1.5 wt%, the DSSCs give the optimal PCE of 6.92%, and the short-circuit density (Jsc) increases dramatically from 11.62 to 13.01 mA cm−2 (ca. 12% enhancement). There are no visible changes for the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). When the loading amount is further increased to 3 wt%, the PCE and Jsc decrease to 6.02% and 11.40 mA cm−2, respectively. For the higher loading amount of 10 wt%, both PCE and Jsc are lower than that of pristine TiO2, indicating that a high amount of γ-Fe2O3 NPs is not beneficial to the PCE. Therefore, the photovoltaic results show the dependence of the enhancements of Jsc and PCE on the amount of γ-Fe2O3 NPs, and the different photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs mainly originate from the variation of Jsc.

As discussed above, the increase of PCE, resulting from the introduction of γ-Fe2O3 NPs, is attributed to the increase of Jsc. In the following discussion, we focus on the analysis of Jsc. Jsc is generally determined by three factors: dye illumination and excitation, electron injection from excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, and electron transport along the conducting channels from TiO2 nanoparticles. To better understand the roles of γ-Fe2O3 NPs on the improved values of Jsc, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed. The change tendency of IPCE data shown in Fig. 4 is in keeping with that of the values of Jsc, as shown in Table 1. The photoanode with 1.5 wt% γ-Fe2O3 content has the highest IPCE values over the whole wavelength range. It is well known that the IPCE and Jsc are related to light harvesting [LHE(λ)], charge injection (Φinj), and charge collection (Φc) according to equation

IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)ΦinjΦc

(1)
and


Jsc = ∫eIPCE(λ)Is(λ)dλ,

(2)
respectively.

The LHE(λ) is a strong function of light scattering and dye-loading properties. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance of the photoanodes before the dye loading was measured in order to check the light scattering effect and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The γ-Fe2O3/TiO2 composite films show no improved reflectance. Furthermore, dye-loading amounts of the photoanodes were estimated by measuring the absorption of dye solution desorbed from the photoanodes with 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution and are listed in Table 1. It is seen that dye-loading amounts of the photoanodes are not significantly changed. Thus, it is confirmed that the photocurrent improvement in DSSCs comprising the γ-Fe2O3 is not due to the enhancement of light scattering or the increment of dye loading.
The rate of electron injection for DSSCs is related to the energetic overlap between the sensitizer excited state distribution function and the density of semiconductor acceptor states. For DSSCs based on the Ru-based dye (N719), strong spin–orbit coupling from the ruthenium heavy atom center accelerates intersystem crossing, resulting in an additional injection mechanism proceeding via the lower energy triplet excited state. It is noted that a low magnetic field can perturb the electron and hole precession rates and increase the triplet concentration, leading to the redistribution of singlet and triplet populations. The increase of triplet excitons can lead to an increase of dissociated charge carriers because of the longer lifetime of triplet excitons compared to that of the singlet excitons, increasing the current through the devices. According to these analyses, the effect of γ-Fe2O3 NPs on the increase of Jsc of DSSCs is very likely due to the magnetic field effect originating from the magnetic γ-Fe2O3 NPs, resulting in the increase of the population of triplet excitons. Thus, we suspect that the Φinj has an important effect on the IPCE and Jsc, but further work is required to clarify this effect.
Φc depends on electron transport and charge recombination in DSSCs. To better understand the electron transport properties and the interfacial characteristics of the photoanodes, EIS measurements were carried out. Fig. 6 shows the impedance spectra for the DSSCs, giving two semicircles, which are assigned to the electrochemical reaction at the counter electrode (a smaller one in high frequency region) and charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte (a larger one in low frequency region). An equivalent circuit is shown as an inset in Fig. 6. Rs is the sheet resistance. Rct1 is corresponding to the first semicircle in the high frequency region, reflecting the charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The large semicircle is related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct2) of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and the Nernst diffusion resistance of electrolyte (W). CPE1 and CPE2 are constant phase elements. These cells show similar Rs, Rct1 and W, leading to similar fill factors because the same electrolyte and counter electrode are used. Therefore, our main concern here is focused on the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface transfer resistance Rct2. The Rct2 value of DSSCs based on the γ-Fe2O3 (0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 10 wt%) photoanodes is 82.3, 66.1, 45.7, 53.2, 81.5 and 85.7 Ω, as calculated from the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 6. The smallest Rct2 is achieved when γ-Fe2O3 content is 1.5 wt%, which is consistent with the observation of its best efficiency among the tested solar cells. The reduction of the resistance Rct2 is due to the increase of the photo-excited electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and the excited dyes are easily recovered by iodide ions. This indicates that a magnetic field originated from the γ-Fe2O3 NPs can affect the electronic structure of the semiconductors (the trap states distribution), leading to more efficient charge transport in the mesoporous TiO2 layer.
In the open-circuit photo-voltage decay (OCVD) experiments of DSSCs, the electron recombination process in the photoanode and the electron lifetime can be inferred. Fig. 7a shows the OCVD of the DSSCs with different amounts of γ-Fe2O3 NPs. The electron lifetime (τn) is obtained from the curve through a computational formula:
τn = −(kBT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1,
where
kB is the Boltzmann coefficient, T is temperature, and e is the electron charge. Fig. 7b shows the electron lifetime as a function of the open circuit voltage. The electron lifetime is mainly affected by the surface state traps in the TiO2 film and can reflect the charge recombination rate and electron transfer rate. It is observed from Fig. 7b that the electron lifetime increases significantly at medium and low voltage regions when the γ-Fe2O3 NPs are introduced into the nanocrystalline TiO2 film. For example, at the voltage of 0.40 V, the electron lifetimes are 28, 49, 377, 316, 115 and 23 ms for the DSSCs based on the γ-Fe2O3 (0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 10 wt%) photoanodes. At the same Voc values, the electron lifetime of the cell with 1.5 wt% of γ-Fe2O3 is longer than that of DSSCs with pure TiO2. This result indicates that more efficient charge transfer process occurs at the photoanode (1.5 wt% γ-Fe2O3)/electrolyte interface, which is beneficial for retarding the charge recombination, resulting in longer electron lifetimes and higher current values. Therefore, we have a possible inference that the main factor affecting the electron lifetime is the magnetic field generated from γ-Fe2O3 NPs, which should affect the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface transfer resistance of DSSCs.

It is noticed that the DSSCs based on the γ-Fe2O3/TiO2 electrodes show first increasing then decreasing performance with increasing γ-Fe2O3 amount. It is possible that a higher γ-Fe2O3 amount can introduce a larger magnetic field into the nanosized TiO2 film. However, the magnetic field effect is to increase the photocurrent followed by a saturation regime for increasing magnetic field, and a larger magnetic field may interrupt exciton dissociation and charge transport in the TiO2 film and cause the decrease of Jsc. Hence, the amount of γ-Fe2O3 NPs in the TiO2 film should be optimized to fabricate efficient DSSCs.

In summary, magnetic γ-Fe2O3 NPs were dispersed in TiO2 film with the intention of improving the efficiency of DSSCs. The power conversion efficiency (6.92%) of the DSSCs can be increased to near 18% at an optimal amount of ∼1.5 wt% γ-Fe2O3 NPs compared with the cell with pure TiO2 NPs (5.84%). The solar cell performance increased without changing the thickness and the complexity of the device. This increase is attributed to the effect of the magnetic field generated from γ-Fe2O3 NPs, leading to improved photogenerated electron transfer ability, increased separation efficiency of charges, and reduced charge recombination. This study provides an effective way for DSSCs to realize the magnetic nanoparticles-induced magnetic field effect and improve photovoltaic performances.
