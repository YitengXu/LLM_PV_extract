To rationalize the marked difference in the energy conversion efficiency of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on organic dyes 1 and 2 different only in their π spacer, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations of the geometries, electronic structures and absorption spectra of the organic dyes before and after binding to titanium oxide were carried out. These enable us to determine factors such as dipole moments associated with the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), and to quantify parameters such as the light harvesting efficiency, the electron injection efficiency associated with the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). The results reveal that compared to 2 with a thiazole spacer, 1 with a thiophene spacer could cause a red shift of the absorption spectrum, increase the oscillator strength and improve the driving force for electron injection, thus leading to the larger Jsc, in good agreement with experimental data. As for Voc, our results stress that apart from the generally emphasized vertical dipole moment of the dyes pointing outward from the semiconductor surface, the number of photoinjected electrons from the dye to the semiconductor is also crucial to obtain high performance dyes with high Voc. After justifying the reliability of the quantum-chemical methods, we designed another four dyes with different π spacers to screen more efficient organic dyes. Fortunately, taking 1 as reference, we find that dye 4 with a thienothiophene spacer displays an enhanced Jsc and Voc, indicating that it will be a more efficient diarylamine-fluorene-based organic dye used in DSSCs, which will play a theoretical guiding role in the design and synthesis of new organic dyes.


Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention due to the intriguing low-cost conversion of photovoltaic energy as compared to conventional silicon-based semiconductor photovoltaic devices, since the seminal work was reported in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel. Up to now, DSSCs with certified recorded efficiencies of more than 11% have been reported based on a nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) film sensitized by a polypyridyl ruthenium-complex (N3, C106) on laboratory scale devices. Although polypyridyl ruthenium dyes have high efficiency and long-term stability, they are scarce and not environmentally benign. In particular, the synthesis and purification of Ru-based dyes is also intricate, which might retard future large-scale power production based on DSSCs. Fortunately, metal-free organic dyes could provide a competitive alternative to polypyridyl ruthenium dyes due to their high molecular extinction coefficient, relatively inexpensive preparation process, and a more straightforward compliance with environmental rules. These advantages also make them ideal candidates in solid state DSSCs in which the thinner TiO2 layer is needed. In particular, it is encouraging to note that a promising photo-to-current conversion efficiency (η) up to 10.3% has been demonstrated by Wang et al.

As the critical component of the DSSC, there are commonly several limiting factors that influence the performance of the organic dyes. Usually, the dye should have an anchor group to strongly adsorb onto the semiconductor surface so as to provide intimate electronic coupling for charge injection. In addition to the strong absorption of visible to near-infrared light coupled with the presence of charge transfer (CT) excited states, which ensure effective charge separation, there should be a large enough driving force to guarantee efficient electron injection, while the ground state oxidation potential of dyes should be lower than that of the redox couple (I−/I−3) to ensure a fast regeneration of the oxidized dye. As a result, to fulfil these requirements, most of the reported organic dyes adopt the donor–π spacer–acceptor (D–π–A) structural motif with arylamine and 2-cyanoacrylic acid as the most common donors and acceptors, respectively.
Although satisfactory progress have been made in preparing high-performance DSSCs with these D–π–A organic dyes, there is still a long way to go for future large-scale commercial production. To further heighten the efficiency, the engineering of sensitizers at a molecular level is paramount. To this end, many researchers such as Sun, Wang, Tian and Hsu, just to name a few, have synthesized and tested a variety of organic dyes because their redox and absorption properties can be effectively tuned by the judicious chemical modification of the individual units, in an attempt to establish the structure–performance relationship. However, this “trial and error” strategy is not always a bed of roses. For example, Tian et al. have synthesized two triarylamine-based dyes with little difference on the donor part, and the performance of cells based on these two dyes is entirely different. Although most of the reports focus on changing the donor to enhance the spectral responses of the dyes, it is well known that the π spacers, such as benzene, pyrrole and thiophene, could have a remarkable influence on the π-conjugation extent of organic dyes and thus their absorption spectra and redox properties. Recently, Chen et al. have synthesized a series of high-performance organic dyes of D–π–A structure used in DSSCs. These dyes consist of a diarylamine moiety acting as the electron donor, 2-cyanoacrylic acid acting as the electron acceptor and anchor group, fluorene and a heteroaromatic ring acting as the π spacer. To our surprise, DSSCs based on two of these dyes different only their spacer, that is thiophene in 1 was replaced with thiazole in 2 (Fig. 1), exhibit quite different energy conversion efficiencies (η1 = 6.78%, η2 = 4.92%). This fact further demonstrates that it is difficult to design high-performance and desirable organic dyes in a predictive way for synthetic chemists. Therefore, for this apparent change of energy conversion efficiency due to the tiny modification, an in-depth understanding of the physical origin at a molecular level is important and urgent to overcome this dilemma a priori. To this end, what deserves special mention is that quantum-chemical methods manifest themselves as a reliable and suitable avenue for the design of new organic dyes.
Here, motivated by the fact that the tiny modification of organic dyes could induce significantly different cell performance, we performed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations on the geometries, electronic structures and absorption spectra of dyes 1 and 2 to attempt to provide insight into the physical origin underlying this difference. On the other hand, we also want to further validate the reliability of quantum-chemical methods in understanding and designing high performance organic dyes (vide infra, Section 3.1). Then, based on these two dyes mentioned above, we constructed another four molecules 3–6 (Fig. 1) by changing the π spacer, which are widely used building blocks in the donor polymers for high-efficiency bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices in order to screen dyes with improved performance (vide infra, Section 3.2). The results reveal that dye 4 with a thienothiophene spacer represents a potential alternative to dye 1 due to the improved performance.

As we know, the energy conversion efficiency (η), which is closely connected to the short-circuit current density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), and the fill factor (FF), is an important parameter to evaluate the performance of DSSCs. This connection could be expressed as the following:

(1)
where
Pinc. is the incident solar power on the cell. According to eqn (1), improving Jsc and Voc is an effective means to enhance η.

As for Voc in DSSCs, it can be determined by:
(2)
where
Ec is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor, Eredox is the electrolyte Fermi-level, kT is the thermal energy, q is the unit charge, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, and NCB is the accessible density of conduction band (CB) states (7 × 1020 cm−3). Upon the adsorption of dyes onto the semiconductor, the shift of Ec could be expressed as:

(3)
 where
q is the electron charge, γ is the dye's surface concentration, and μnormal is the component of dipole moment of the individual molecule perpendicular to the surface of semiconductor surface, ε0 and ε are the permittivity of the vacuum and the dielectric constant of the organic monolayer. Thus, according to eqn (2) and (3), it is obvious that a dye with a large μnormal will induce a significant variation of Voc. In addition, the number of electrons in the conduction band nc also has an influence on the Voc.

The Jsc in DSSCs is determined by the following equation:
Jsc = ∫λLHE(λ)Φinject.ηcollect.dλ
(4)
where
LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, Φinject. is the electron injection efficiency, and ηcollect. is the charge collection efficiency. For the same DSSCs with only different dyes, just as for the organic dyes under study, it is reasonable to assume that the ηcollect. is a constant. As a result, the enhancement of Jsc should focus on improving the LHE and Φinject..


All the calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package. Full ground state geometry optimization of dyes 1–6 before and after binding to TiO2 in vacuum was carried out using B3LYP hybrid functional alone with 6-31G* for C, H, O, N, S atoms, effective core potential (ECP) LANL2DZ and its accompanying basis set for Ti atom. Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory as geometry optimization to confirm that the optimized geometry corresponds to a stationary point. For optimizing the geometry of these organic dyes like 1, Preat et al. have demonstrated that this method could provide satisfactory geometry comparable to MP2 with a much smaller computational cost. As for the absorption, it is important to note that a conventional exchange–correlation functional such as a pure and hybrid functional due to the self-interaction error enormously underestimates the excitation energy of excited states with significant charge-transfer (CT) character. Thus, a judicious choice of functional is crucial to accurately describe the absorption of D–π–A-organic dyes with non-negligible CT character. Coulomb-attenuating method CAM-B3LYP functional taking long-range correction into account, which has been proved to be appropriate for CT type excitations, was chosen to calculate the vertical excitation energies and the oscillator strengths within the framework of TDDFT. The solvent effects of tetrahydrofuran (THF, the solvent used to record the experimental spectra) on the absorption spectra, was considered using non-equilibrium implementation of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM), which returns valid solvent effects when there are no specific interactions between the solute and the solvent molecules. In fact, the credibility of the CAM-B3LYP method combined with the C-PCM solvent effects model for the investigation of vertical transition energies of D–π–A-organic dyes has been corroborated in many papers. The 6-31+G* for C, H, O, N, S atoms and LANL2DZ for Ti atom have been selected for the calculation of absorption. We have proved that this combination of basis sets could return converged vertical transition energies for a series of organic dyes. The oxidation potential of the ground state was evaluated at C-PCM-B3LYP/UB3LYP/6-311G** level with the geometry of B3LYP/6-31G* level through single points calculations of the neutral and cation dye. The natural population analysis was carried out at the C-PCM-B3LYP/6-31G* level for non-metal atoms and LANL2DZ level for Ti atom using NBO 3.1 of Gaussian 09 through single points calculations. The dipole moments of free dyes were also obtained at the geometry of the dyes bound to TiO2 under the C-PCM-B3LYP/6-31G* level. For computational convenience, the long alkyl chain in the experimental 1 and 2 complexes was replaced by methyl, which has been proven not to change their electronic structures.


Here, we adopted a simple dye–titanium dioxide (TiO2) model to simulate the interfacial interaction between the dye and the semiconductor, as shown in Fig. 2. Although this model seems to be an outrageous approximation, Peng and coworkers have demonstrated that this model is sufficient for the investigation of geometries, excitations, and electronic structures of organic dyes after binding to TiO2. Nevertheless, as emphasized by Peng, “such a model should be used with precautions”. Thus, we also checked the reliability of our used model (vide infra). As mentioned above, while dyes 1 and 2 only differ in the π spacer with the same donor and acceptor structures, i.e. the thiophene unit in dye 1 is replaced with thiazole in dye 2, the cells prepared with dyes 1 and 2 have markedly different η (6.78% for 1 and 4.92% for 2). Thus, with this simple dye–TiO2 model, it is necessary to give a reasonable interpretation for this intricate structure–performance connection with the aim to pave the way for the future synthesis of novel organic dyes. In the following, we first shed light on the difference in the energy conversion efficiency in terms of factors associated with Jsc and Voc, respectively. Subsequently, we consider another four organic dyes to filter the promising dyes.


The optimized geometrical structures of dyes 1 and 2 before and after binding to TiO2 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). From a geometrical point of view, the steric hindrance of the diarylamine moiety could prevent unfavorable aggregation of the dyes at the semiconductor surface, which could cause intermolecular energy transfer and has been proven to be one of the major factors decreasing the efficiency of the cells. Another important factor influencing the performance of the dyes is the conjugation degree between the donor and acceptor, which could be related to the extent of intramolecular charge transfer. This could be reflected by the torsion angle of the π spacer out of the horizontal line listed in Fig. S1. The calculated results indicate that the two dyes have similar conjugation degree properties in view of their similar torsion angles (22° and 21°).

As discussed above, if the charge collection efficiency ηcollect. could be considered as a constant for the same cell architecture, LHE and Φinject. are the two main factors influencing Jsc. Therefore, we first simulated the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the two dyes in THF solution to provide insight into the LHE. The computed maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strengths (f), nature of the transitions and the electron density difference maps corresponding to S0 → S1 in THF obtained by TD-C-PCM-CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* with the B3LYP/6-31G* geometries are summarized in Table 1. It follows from Table 1 that the calculated data for dyes 1 and 2 are in excellent agreement with the experimental results with discrepancies of about 0.1 eV of the vertical transition energies, and f has the same trend as the molar extinction coefficient (ε), which justifies the soundness of the theoretical method used. The overestimation of f may arise from a high exact exchange percent of CAM-B3LYP, which is consistent with the findings of Preat. The strongest absorption peaks for dyes 1 and 2 arise from S0 → S1, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), which mainly correspond to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO, and are associated with the promotion from HOMO-1 to the LUMO. As shown in Table 1, the introduction of a different π spacer in the molecular structure exerts a remarkable influence on both the CT transition absorption wavelength and corresponding molar extinction coefficient. Fig. 3 shows the frontier molecular orbitals of free dyes 1 and 2 obtained from CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* in gas phase. For the two dyes, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are spread over diphenylamine and the fluorene moiety, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are mainly centralized on the heteroaromatic ring and 2-cyanoacrylic acid fragments. The anchoring group (–COOH) of both dyes has sizable contributions to the LUMOs, which could lead to a strong electronic coupling with the TiO2 surface and thus boost the electron injection efficiency. The frontier molecular orbital spatial distributions indicate that their excited states are of vectorial charge-transfer transition character, which has been proven to be beneficial for the ultrafast interfacial electron injection from the excited state of the dye to the CB of TiO2, and could also slow down the recombination of the injected electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized dye. In view of the multiconfiguration character, the electronic density differences between the ground state and the first excited state were also plotted using GaussSum (shown in Table 1) to assign the character of the excited states unambiguously. Obviously, the decreasing electron density mainly localizes on the electronic donor and fluorene segment, while the increasing electron density mainly localizes on the heteroaromatic ring and electronic acceptor, which is indicative of an intramolecular CT when the transition occurs, agreeing well with the electronic structure analysis discussed above. Furthermore, comparing the computed HOMO and LUMO energies with the edge of the CB of TiO2 and the potential of the redox couple, Fig. 4 shows that they all have more negative HOMO energies than the I−/I−3 redox couple (−4.8 eV vs. vacuum), leading to a fast regeneration of the oxidized dyes, while more positive LUMO energies than the CB of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum) could ensure an effective injection of excited electrons.

According to eqn (4), in order to obtain a high Jsc, the efficient organic dyes used in DSSCs should have a large LHE, which is expressed as:
LHE = 1 − 10−f
(5)
where
f is the oscillator strength of the dye corresponding to λmax. Compared with 2, the larger f of 1, leading to the higher LHE (0.98 for 1 and 0.96 for 2), compensates well for its blue-shift adsorption spectrum.

For the dye bound to TiO2, the calculated results of the absorption spectra are listed in Table 2. Compared with Table 1, it is interesting to note that upon binding, the absorption spectra are red-shifted and the oscillator strengths are also improved. The frontier molecular orbital distributions and energies of dye–TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3. It could be observed that when the dyes are adsorbed onto TiO2, there are some contributions of the 3d orbitals of the Ti atom to the LUMO. The red-shift of the spectra after binding could be ascribed to the interactions between the anchor or acceptor group (–COOH) and the 3d orbitals of the Ti atom, resulting in the decrease of the LUMO energies compared with the isolated dyes.

Another way to enhance Jsc is to improve Φinject. which is related to the driving force (ΔGinject.) of the electron injection from the photoinduced excited states of organic dyes to the TiO2 surface. In general, the larger ΔGinject., the larger Φinject, and it can be expressed (in eV) as:
ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB
(6)
where
Edye* is the oxidation potential of the excited dye, and ECB is the reduction potential of the CB of the semiconductor. As we know that the CB of semiconductor is sensitive to the conditions, and it is difficult to determine accurately, here we use a widely used experimental value of −4.00 eV (vs. vacuum).

As far as Edye* is concerned, there are two schemes to evaluate its value, that is on the basis of the relaxed and unrelaxed geometries of the excited states by means of adiabatic and vertical excitation energy, respectively. However, it is justifiable to utilize the latter conveniently for future fast screening of organic dyes, because Preat has demonstrated that the absolute difference between them is a constant and is comparable to the mean average error. In addition, there is also substantial experimental evidence that the primary electron transfer event in DSSCs occurs much faster than vibrational relaxation of the photoexcited dyes. Hence, in this case, it is reasonable to assume that the electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state and Edye* is expressed as:
Edye* = Edye − λmax
(7)

Edye is the redox potential of the ground state of the dye, and λmax is the vertical transition energy. The calculated and experimental Edye and deduced Edye* and ΔGinject. are listed in Table 3. It is obvious that the calculated Edye and unrelaxed Edye* are in good agreement with the experimental values with deviation less than 0.1 eV. On the other hand, the difference between the calculated unrelaxed ΔGinject. and the experimental relaxed ΔGinject. is a constant (∼0.4 eV) and the Edye* displacements (ΔEdye*, 0.14 eV vs. experimental unrelaxed 0.18 and relaxed 0.12 eV) are quantitatively well reproduced between 1 and 2, consistent with the conclusions of Preat as mentioned above. It also verifies the reliability of our procedure to determine the driving force of the organic dyes. Moreover, the results displayed in Table 3 reveal that the thiophene unit instead of thiazole as the π-spacer has a significant influence on Edye*, but a more limited effect on Edye, leading to a larger driving force, which is consistent with the characteristics and the energy level of the frontier orbitals depicted in Fig. 3.

At this point, the change of short-circuit current density Jsc between 1 and 2 was demonstrated by means of the light harvesting efficiency LHE and driving force ΔGinject for the electron injection. In the following, we propose a reasonable explanation for another factor affecting the energy conversion efficiency – open-circuit photovoltage Voc.

As discussed in section 2, we know that the shift of the CB, which is related to μnormal of the dyes, will lead to a change in Voc. Grätzel and coworkers have confirmed theoretically that the larger the μnormal of the adsorbed molecules pointing outward from the semiconductor surface, the larger the Voc. This strategy has also been invoked to explain the different Voc of organic dyes by Chen. According to the experimental results, it turns out that the Voc of dye 1 is slightly larger than that of 2 (680 mV > 660 mV), thus we infer that dye 1 should have a slightly larger vertical dipole moment than 2. In order to validate our speculation, based on the recommendation of Grätzel et al., we calculated μnormal of the dyes under B3LYP/6-31G* level including solvent effects by means of the C-PCM model at the geometry of dyes adsorbed onto TiO2. Considering the bidentate binding mode of the dyes, we made the C2 axis of the carboxylate in the dye parallel to the x-axis, and the TiO2 surface parallel to the yz plane. Thus the orientations of the dyes after binding to TiO2 are simulated. And the dipole moments along the x-axis of the dyes are the μnormal. The calculated results are shown in Fig. 5. To our surprise, dye 1 has a slightly smaller μnormal than 2, which is not in line with the generally recognized opinion. However, from eqn (2), we know that Voc is also associated with the charge distribution in the semiconductor. As a result, we calculated the charge distributions of dye–TiO2 at both the ground state and first excited state to qualitatively or semi-quantitatively determine the number of photoinduced electrons from the excited dye to TiO2 by means of natural population analysis (NPA), which has no strong dependence on the method such as the basis set and thus could provide a reliable charge distribution (Table 4). The results demonstrate the number of photoinjected electrons for dye 1 (0.083 e) is larger than that of 2 (0.072 e), According to eqn (2) and (3), we know that besides μnormal, the large nc could also improve Voc. So we believe that the greater number of electrons transferred from dye 1 to the semiconductor compensates well for the slightly smaller μnormal than that of dye 2. At this point, it should be pointed out that taking both the photoinduced electron injection (that is, the charge distribution of dye–TiO2 upon excitation) and the μnormal of the adsorbed dyes into account is crucial to improve the open-circuit photovoltage.

Although the difference in Voc for 1 and 2 has been demonstrated, there are two issues which need to be pointed out. First, although Ti(OH)3H2O as a TiO2 model could reasonably describe the electronic coupling interaction between organic dyes and the semiconductor for the absorption spectra (vide supra), it is necessary to use a more realistic TiO2 model to accurately describe the electron injection process and the charge distribution of TiO2 upon excitation in view of the small number of photo-injected electrons (less than 0.1 e). Currently, the more realistic TiO2 models such as a one-dimensional nanowire and a rutile (110) surface with periodic boundary condition were used by Meng and Prezhdo to study the electron injection process, respectively. Nonetheless, we believe our simplistic TiO2 model could reproduce, at least qualitatively, the trend of charge distribution. In order to validate the adequacy of the employed simplistic TiO2 model, we also use the model of a (TiO2)6 nanocluster to simulate the effect of the semiconductor, which has been demonstrated to be the smallest nanocluster model to simulate semiquantitatively all the features in the electronic structure of the system by Sánchez-de-Armas and Sanz et al. We took the geometries of the (TiO2)6 cluster from ref. 60. After optimizing the geometries of dyes 1 and 2 bound to (TiO2)6 (see Fig. S3), we calculated the corresponding properties including optical properties, vertical dipole moments and atomic charge distributions with the same theoretical method as we have used for dye–Ti(OH)3H2O herein. The calculated results are listed in Table S1 and Table S2. We find that although the absolute values of these properties change as the TiO2 model alters, the trend of these properties is still the same with the dye bound to Ti(OH)3H2O. So we believe the simplistic model we adopted here is reasonable to rapidly screen new and efficient organic dyes. Second, as we know the injected electron in the CB of the semiconductor could also recombine with the oxidized organic dyes and the redox couple in the electrolyte and thus decrease nc, exerting a detrimental effect on the Voc. However, due to the high concentration of the redox couple in the electrolyte, the rapid rate of reduction of the oxidized dye by I− and the similar distance between the TiO2 surface and the HOMO orbital of the dyes, charge recombination between the oxidized sensitizer and the injected electrons can usually be ignored or considered as having similar recombination rates. The charge recombination between the redox couple and the injected electrons in the TiO2 CB is generally determined by the blocking effect of the sensitizer associated with the structures and the adsorption amount of the dyes, the complexation between the dyes and iodide, and the electron injection depth in TiO2. For the dyes we studied, there is little difference of the π spacer on the structures, so we supposed that they have similar charge recombination situations. Thus, the discussion of the photoinduced electron injection to determine nc is reasonable, at least to a good first approximation.

Molecular structures of four theoretically possible dyes 3–6 with different π spacers, which are derived from dye 1, are shown in Fig. 1. From 3 to 6, the π spacers are silole, thienothiophene, pyrrole and benzothiadiazole, respectively. Herein, we attempted to find a dye with improved performance using the previously validated theoretical methods. In what follows, the performances of these four dyes were evaluated by taking 1 as a reference dye. Thus, here we applied three criteria: (1) to improve the open-circuit voltage, the vertical dipole moment and the number of photoinjected electrons should be not less than 6.94 D and 0.083 e to upshift the Fermi level, respectively; (2) LHE should be larger than 0.98 with a red-shift absorption spectrum to match the solar spectrum and to maximize the photocurrent response; (3) the driving force should be larger than, or at least comparable to, 1.62 eV. As discussed in section 2, improving LHE and −ΔGinject. could enhance the Jsc of the cell.

The optimized geometries of the free dyes and dye–TiO2 for 3–6 are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). From Fig. S4, it is worth noting that the π spacer has a significant influence on the torsion angle between the plane of the donor and that of the acceptor. Specifically, dye 5 (6) has a larger torsion angle 39° (32°), while dye 3 with a silole ring has the smallest torsion angle (6°). For dye 4, its torsion angle is similar to 1 (22°). It has been proven that the degree of the π-conjugation is very important for efficient electronic communication between the donor and the acceptor, which determines the CT amplitude. Just judging from the torsion angle, 3 and 4 will be potential candidates. As for an energy level match, Fig. 4 shows the frontier molecular orbital distributions and energies of free dyes 3–6 together with dye 1. As expected, in comparison with 1, dyes 3 to 6 have similar HOMO energies and distributions due to having the same donor, while the LUMO energies are significantly different, increasing in the order of 6 < 3 < 4 < 1 < 5, as reported in Fig. 4 due to the different electron-withdrawing abilities of the π spacers. The corresponding absorption spectra properties of the free dyes 3–6 are collected in Table 5 and shown in Fig S2. As can be seen in Table 5, all four dyes have strong absorption coupled with the presence of CT excited states, which ensure effective charge separation. Simultaneously, they also have the same Edye due to having the same donor groups, which are more positive than the I−/I−3 redox couple, leading to a fast regeneration. The λmax corresponding to the CT is in the order 5 < 1 < 4 < 6 < 3, and the LHE is 6 < 3 <5 = 1 < 4. For both dyes 3 and 6, they have a smaller LHE and driving force than dye 1, so they are not suitable for obtaining a higher Jsc. Dye 5 has the largest driving force but with an excessively blue-shifted absorption, which is not beneficial for matching with the solar radiation spectrum. The increase in the excitation energy of dye 5 can be ascribed to the larger torsion angle (Fig. S4) between the donor and acceptor. It is also interesting to note that the absorption of dye 3 shows the largest red shift because the σ*–π* interaction in the silole ring leads to a stabilized LUMO. With respect to dye 4, it has an improved LHE and similar driving force with a red-shifted absorption spectrum compared with 1, and thus we expect that dye 4 will have a higher Jsc.

As far as Voc is concerned, Table 4 shows that the calculated μnormal for dyes 3–6 are 7.86 D, 7.25 D, 7.10 D, and 7.06 D, respectively, which are all slightly larger than that of dye 1 (6.94 D). We also calculated the number of electrons transferred from the dye to the semiconductor after photoexcitation as shown in Table 4. The values are 0.051, 0.079, 0.108, and 0.046 e, respectively. We therefore make a reasonable inference that the cell with dye 4 with the larger μnormal and the similar number of electrons transferred compared with dye 1 could have a larger Voc. At the same time, we find that dye 5 has both improved μnormal and the number of electrons transferred, so we infer that the cell with dye 5 should also have a larger Voc than the cell with dye 1.
As a consequence of the above, it is not absurd to argue that dye 4 is the most promising candidate among this series of organic dyes under investigation. A DSSC using dye 4 could show a higher Voc and Jsc when compared with dye 1 and thus the overall energy conversion efficiency would be improved. In fact, the thienothiophene unit as π spacer has already been widely used by Wang et al. to heighten the performance of organic dyes with η as high as 9.8%.

Factors influencing the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), including light harvesting efficiency and electron injection efficiency, the vertical dipole moment of the dyes upon adsorption onto TiO2 and the number of electrons transferred from the dye to the semiconductor after photoexcitation, respectively, have been discussed comprehensively with DFT and TDDFT methods to rationalize the differences in power conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on dyes 1 and 2. By comparing with the available experimental data, the soundness of DFT and TDDFT was further confirmed. The results of this work allow us to clarify how the π-spacer affects the performance of the dyes, and underline that for the design and development of novel organic dyes, besides the widely used strategy, improving the vertical dipole moment of the dyes upon adsorption onto TiO2, the photoinduced charge distributions are also crucial for improving the Voc. On the other hand, the Jsc, which is governed by the light harvesting efficiency and electron injection efficiency, could be enhanced by a judicious choice of π spacer. Compared with dye 1, we find that the π-conjugation degree of 4 could be improved by replacing thiophene with thienothiophene; moreover, the similar driving force and enhanced light harvesting efficiency together with a red-shifted absorption result in a larger Jsc potential. As for Voc, it should be improved due to the larger vertical dipole moment and the similar number of photoinduced electrons. It is our expectation that a solar cell made from dye 4 will have better performances than the dye 1cell. We hope this work will be helpful for the design of organic dyes with target properties to improve the performance of dye sensitized solar cells.
