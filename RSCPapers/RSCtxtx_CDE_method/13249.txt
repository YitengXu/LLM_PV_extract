Low-cost and eco-friendly hole-transport materials (HTMs) are exceedingly desirable for the practical application of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Here, a traditional bidentate ligand (1,10-phenanthroline), widely used as a chelating agent for bioorganic reagents and probes, is incorporated into an HTM to afford M1. Such a planar bidentate ligand at the central core of the HTM can facilitate π–π stacking and enable chelation to Pb2+ ion defects and thus achieve efficient passivation at the M1/perovskite interface, contributing to reduced recombination loss. When employed as an HTM in inverted PVSCs without dopants, bidentate-ligand-based M1 yields a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.14%, which is significantly higher than that (18.32%) of the M0 analogue that contains phenanthrene. More importantly, green solvent processing (ethyl acetate) of M1 achieves a PCE of 19.21%, which is among the highest values reported in PVSCs with a green-solvent-processable HTM. Besides, the facile one-step synthesis route reduces the cost to 45 $ gram−1 for M1, which is cheaper than the most reported HTMs for high-efficiency PVSCs without dopants. These findings demonstrate the potential of bidentate ligands in developing cost-effective and eco-friendly HTMs toward highly efficient PVSCs.

Hole-transport materials (HTMs) play a critical role in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Aside from hole extraction and transport and electron blocking at the perovskite/HTM interface, HTMs can also affect the perovskite crystal growth as the front layer, especially in inverted (p–i–n) PVSC architectures. Moreover, HTMs can regulate other interface properties between the perovskite and the HTM, e.g., surface trap passivation. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop novel HTMs for achieving highly efficient and stable PVSCs. Compared with inorganic HTMs, organic HTMs can be processed in solution at low temperature and provide structural variability for tuning the optoelectrical and morphological properties to match perovskite via rational design.

Although the conventional (n–i–p) structure of PVSCs has achieved remarkable success with PCEs of over 25%, inverted PVSCs possess diverse superiorities, such as reduced hysteresis and the ease of low-temperature processing. Towards high-performance inverted PVSCs, ideal HTMs must exhibit appropriate energy level alignment with the perovskite, high transparency in the visible-light region, sufficient solubility in common solvents, good film morphology, and high mobility. Moreover, it is important for developing dopant-free HTMs to improve the device stability. Besides, cost-effective preparation of organic/polymer HTMs is highly desirable for scaling up toward practical application. For example, the polymer-based HTM, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is widely used in inverted PVSCs. However, the acidity of PEDOT:PSS can corrode indium tin oxide (ITO), causing interfacial degradation and reducing device stability. For this point, small molecular HTMs (SM-HTMs) via straightforward synthesis have shown great potential, benefiting from their well-defined molecular structure, facile purification, and good reproducibility. Regarding the molecular design of efficient SM-HTMs for PVSCs, several principles can be followed. First, employing conjugated planar building blocks can bring strong π–π stacking effects and strengthen intermolecular interactions, which are beneficial to increase hole mobility. Second, pseudo-3D conjugated triphenylamines have been demonstrated as the most frequently used hole-transporting moiety because they can effectively transport holes to improve charge mobility at molecular levels. Third, passivating groups with exposed lone-pair electrons are expected to be attached to HTMs to passivate the ionic defects on the perovskite layers. On the other hand, highly toxic chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform or chronic toxicity toluene are widely utilized as solvents for HTMs at present. To reduce environmental pollution and human health risks, it is advisable to use green solvents, e.g., ethyl acetate (EA), isopropanol, and tetrahydrofuran, for the environmental-friendly processing of HTMs during both scientific research and industrial production. However, conjugated HTMs usually show low solubility in these green solvents. Therefore, it is urgent to design SM-HTMs combining low cost, high efficiency, and eco-friendly solvent processability simultaneously.
The metal-chelating properties of 1,10-phenanthroline have been widely used in a range of analytical reagents and probes as well as herbicides, which are capable of strongly coordinating with metal ions via chelation effects, such as passivating the under-coordinated Pb2+ ion defects on the surface. Introducing bidentate ligands into perovskite active layers has proven to be an effective strategy for improving grain-boundary passivation and the device performance of PVSCs. However, there are only a few successful examples in the charge transport layers. Moreover, bidentate ligands with highly polar moieties like pyridine have the potential to enable sufficient solubility in green solvents. When involving such bidentate ligands in constructing organic HTMs, those HTMs may have better solubility for environmental-friendly solvent processing.
In this work, we proposed a new design strategy engaging a planar bidentate ligand as the core to construct a new cost-effective SM-HTM. 4,4′-(1,10-Phenanthroline-3,8-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (Scheme 1, designated as M1) was designed and synthesized via a one-step facile reaction with a decent yield of 78%. M1 features the extensively used bidentate ligand 1,10-phenanthroline as the core unit, and 4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl (TPA) as the peripheral units. A control HTM, 4,4′-(phenanthrene-2,7-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (Scheme 1, designated as M0), adopts non-coordinating phenanthrene as the core. Although M0 and M1 have similar conjugated planar cores, the bidentate ligand moiety in M1 can passivate the Pb2+ ion defects. Moreover, the uniform film morphology and moderate wettability of the M1 film help the perovskite to form compact films while the non-uniform and rougher M0 film surface results in multiple pinholes appearing in the perovskite film, which may decrease the ambient device stability. When used as the dopant-free HTM in inverted PVSCs, the M1-based PVSC exhibits a champion PCE of 20.14% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.65 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.0%. The device based on M0 shows an inferior PCE of 18.32% with a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 22.44 mA cm−2, and an FF of 80.2%. Moreover, EA processing of M1 achieved a PCE of 19.21%, which is highly desirable for both academic and industrial communities. It should be noted that the synthetic cost of M1 is decreased to 45 $ g−1. These results indicate the potential of numerous conjugated bidentate ligands for incorporation in efficient dopant-free HTMs for PVSCs.

Anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%), anhydrous ethanol (99.8%), anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%), and all other solvents were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and lead(II) chloride (PbCl2), methylammonium iodide (MAI), formamidinium iodide (FAI), and C60 were purchased from p-OLED. BCP (99%) was obtained from TCI. All the materials were used as received.


The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ascend 400 MHz spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded using the ThermoScientificTM Q-Exactive system. UV-Vis optical absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were recorded using a Dimension Icon Scanning Probe Microscope (Asylum Research, MFP-3D-Stand Alone). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted under an argon atmosphere using a CHI760E voltammetric workstation with an argon-saturated supporting electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in CH3CN, using a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a silver wire reference electrode. And the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+) was used as the external standard for all the measurements with a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were performed using the Gaussian 09 program.


Compound 3 was synthesized based on the previously published procedures. A mixture of compound 3 (250 mg, 0.58 mmol), 2,7-dibromophenanthrene (77 mg, 0.23 mmol) or 3,8-dibromo-1,10-phenanthroline (78 mg, 0.23 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (28 mg, 0. 046 mmol), K2CO3 (90 mg, 0.6 mmol), H2O (1 mL), and THF (7 mL) was added to a 25 mL dried flask and heated to reflux for 18 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After the solvent was evaporated, the residue was purified using column chromatography (silica gel, petroleum ether:dichloromethane = 1:1 as the eluent) to obtain products in 75% yield for M0 as a pale green solid and 78% yield for M1 as a yellow solid. The NMR and HRMS data and spectra were recorded and are shown in the ESI.


PVSCs were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/HTMs/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag, according to a previous report except for the HTM deposition.M0 or M1 HTMs were prepared by dropwise addition of the CB solution (2 mg mL−1 for the optimized devices) onto the substrates and then spin-coating at a rate of 4500 rpm (rpm) for 30 seconds followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. For eco-friendly processing, M0 or M1 HTMs were prepared by the dropwise addition of EA solution (0.2 mg mL−1 for the optimized devices) onto the substrates and then spin-coating at a rate of 3000 rpm for 30 seconds followed by the same thermal annealing.

For device characterization, all current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a Xe lamp-based SS-F5-3A Solar Simulator (Enli Technology, Inc.). A Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5G filter was used as the white-light source. The light intensity was controlled using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter. The device spectra were recorded both in reverse scan (1.2 V → −0.2 V, step 0.02 V) and forward scan (−0.2 V → 1.2 V, step 0.02 V) with a 2 ms delay time. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a QE-R3011 measurement system (Enli Technology, Inc.).
For the maximum power point (MPP) tracking test, the solar cell devices were fixed at the Vmpp, and the current density variation under an inert environment (∼25 °C) was recorded. A 100-second interval was selected to record the value of the current density. For the ambient stability test, unencapsulated devices were kept in a dark box under an ambient environment (∼25 °C, 45 ± 5% relative humidity). The J–V curves of the cells were recorded in certain time intervals with simulated solar illumination at the 1 Sun intensity.

DFT calculations were utilized to provide insight into the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of M0 and M1 at the B3LYP/6-31(d) level. As shown in Fig. 1, their cores based on phenanthrene or phenanthroline feature a highly planar backbone and enable similar linear configurations for both molecules. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of M0 and M1 are mainly distributed on the TPA moieties. Compared with M0, the HOMO of M1 shows a slightly smaller part on the phenanthroline cores, probably due to the weak electron-deficient nature of phenanthroline. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are mainly located on the π-conjugated cores. As expected, M1 with the phenanthroline core showed lower-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels (−4.63 and −1.39 eV) in comparison with those (−4.53 and −1.10 eV) of M0.


M0 and M1 presented in Scheme 1 were synthesized using one-step Suzuki coupling with excellent yields of 75% and 78%, respectively, and the chemical structures of M0 and M1 were confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS techniques. Scheme S1 (ESI) describes the detailed synthesis route, and Table S1 (ESI) demonstrates the calculation of the synthetic cost of M1. The solubility of M0 is determined to be 45 mg mL−1 in CB and 5 mg mL−1 in EA, while the solubility of M1 is lower, which is 22 mg mL−1 in CB and 0.9 mg mL−1 in EA at room temperature. The optical absorption properties of M0 and M1 in both the solution and film states were characterized. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2(a), and data are summarized in Table 1. In the solution, both SM-HTMs exhibit characteristic π–π* transition absorption peaks, at 380 nm for M0 and 404 nm for M1. From the solution to the film state, bathochromic shifts of the absorption onsets are observed, 13 nm for M0 and 9 nm for M1, with the optical band gap (Eoptg) of 2.85 eV and 2.69 eV in the film, respectively. Such phenomena indicate slightly increased intermolecular aggregation in the film state. Both HTM films on the ITO were thin enough to maintain almost the same transmittance compared with bare ITO, as confirmed in Fig. S7 (ESI). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis were conducted to probe the thermal properties of M0 and M1. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI), M0 and M1 possess high decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 468 °C and 448 °C, respectively. However, DSC demonstrates different thermal properties for the two HTMs. A lower glass transition temperature (Tg) is detected at 101 °C for M0, indicating its amorphous nature as shown in Fig. 2(b); however, for M1, a higher Tg of 118 °C is observed, followed by a melting temperature at 265 °C. M1 exhibits a better thermal stability for device fabrication and long-term stability.

Efficient HTMs require suitable HTM/perovskite interfacial band alignment and sufficient hole mobility, and determine the resulting PVSC device performance. As shown in Table 1, the CV measurements (Fig. 2c and Table 1) of both HTMs agree well with the calculation results. The HOMO levels of M0 and M1 are −5.28 and −5.31 eV, appropriate for the valence band maximum of perovskite. M1 shows a slightly down-shifted HOMO level compared with that of M0. The LUMO levels of M0 and M1 are calculated to be −2.43 eV and −2.62 eV, respectively, lying higher than the conduction band minimum of perovskite (−3.90 eV), which can result in an excellent electron-blocking capability for the two HTMs. Besides, hole-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement. A bottom anode dipole interlayer PEDOT: PSS was used to increase the work function of ITO, ensuring that the ITO acts as an anode to fulfill selective hole collection. The hole mobility of the neat M1 film is calculated to be 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 1 and Fig. S9, ESI), which is slightly higher than 1.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 of M0. Nonetheless, both HTMs are parallel to the hole mobility of commercialized PTAA (∼10−5–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Thus, the pristine M0 and M1 films possess a promising hole-transporting capacity, which favorably allows them to function as effective HTMs in PVSCs without an extra doping process.
AFM was utilized to study the topographic morphology of the HTMs films. The AFM image of the M1 film displayed in Fig. 3b shows a smoother surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.318 nm, while the M0 film exhibits a coarse surface as shown in Fig. 3a, with an RMS roughness of 1.201 nm. When the surface wettability was investigated by perfroming water contact angle measurements on the M0 and M1 films, it was revealed that M1 has a favorable contact angle of 36.8°, which is smaller than M0 (73.6°) (Fig. 3c and d); this may result in better contact between M1 and the perovskite layer because sufficient wettability of the HTM is needed to adhere the polar perovskite precursor solution to the substrate. As observed by the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images given in Fig. 3e and f, although both perovskites show similar grain sizes, the perovskite film growing on M0 shows multiple pinholes. In contrast, the perovskite film on M1 is uniform and compact, which can be rationalized by the distinct surface morphology revealed by AFM (Fig. 3a and b). It is widely acknowledged that pinholes on the perovskite will impair the device performance and stability of PVSCs. Besides, perovskite films formed on M1 exhibit a sharper (110) crystalline peak in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern than that of M0 (Fig. S10, ESI). The average crystal size of the perovskite grown on M1, calculated using Scherrer's equation, is 46.58 nm, compared to that (33.03 nm) on M0, indicating the better film crystallinity of the perovskite on M1 (Table S3, ESI). Consequently, M1 may be a more better HTM than M0 regarding this aspect.
XPS measurements were carried out to confirm the possible Pb ← N coordination from a bidentate ligand in M1 to undercoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite (Fig. 4). In pristine perovskite without HTM treatment, there are two main peaks of the Pb atom from the excited electrons of the 4f/7 and 4f/5 orbitals, and they are followed by two small peaks at a lower binding energy belonging to the existence of unsaturated Pb2+. As shown in Fig. 4a, after spin-coating a thin layer of M0 on the top of perovskite, the small peaks for Pb 4f still remained. However, these unsaturated peaks disappeared when the perovskite was coated with M1, and the Pb 4f peaks shift to a lower binding energy. Moreover, as seen in Fig. 4b, nitrogen XPS shows that there are both N 1s peaks at 397.8 eV assigned to the TPA units of M0 and M1, while an additional peak at 396.8 eV appeared in the pure M1 film, which can be allocated to the nitrogen atoms on the 1,10-phenanthroline. The peaks at 397.8 eV from TPA of both HTMs show no apparent shift on ITO or the perovskite substrates, but the 1,10-phenanthroline nitrogen peak at 396.8 eV disappeared or moved to a higher binding energy and overlapped with the TPA nitrogen peak. Overall, these results demonstrate that 1,10-phenanthroline in M1 can effectively interact with the Pb2+ defects at the M1/perovskite interface (Fig. 4c), leading to a probably passivated perovskite active layer in PVSCs.
To evaluate the potential of the two SM-HTMs in inverted PVSCs, we fabricated and characterized photovoltaic devices with an architecture of ITO/HTM/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag, where M1 was used as an HTM and M0 as the control. Fig. 5a illustrates the J–V curves of the best-performing PVSCs in both reverse and forward scan directions under AM 1.5G solar illumination, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device with M1 processed using CB showed a high PCE of 20.14% in the reverse scan (Voc = 1.08 V, Jsc = 22.65 mA cm−2, FF = 82.0%), and a PCE of 19.79% was achieved in the forward scan. In comparison, a moderate PCE of 18.32% (Voc = 1.04 V, Jsc = 22.02 mA cm−2, FF = 80.2%) was obtained for the M0-based devices in the reverse scan direction while a PCE of 17.76% was obtained in the forward scan direction. The enhanced Voc (1.08 V) of the M1-based device compared with that (1.04 V) of the M0-based device can be rationalized as the slightly deeper HOMO level of the M1 and the passivation effect by the chelating phenanthroline block. To confirm the Jsc values, we performed EQE experiments (Fig. 5b), and the M1-based devices show a higher EQE response over the whole absorption spectrum of the perovskite active layer compared with the M0-based devices. The integrated Jsc values of the M0 (21.10 mA cm−2) and M1 (21.69 mA cm−2)-based devices agree with the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurements. We also monitored the current density as a function of time at the maximum power point (MPP) and the stabilized PCE to further verify the device performance reliability. Fig. 5c shows the stabilized PCE of 17.35% at 0.88 V and 19.70% at 0.92 V for the M0- and M1-based devices over a 100-second duration, respectively, matching well with the J–V scan results. Moreover, the statistical distribution of the photovoltaic parameters of the M1-based devices is more concentrated than that of the M0-based devices, suggesting the better reproducibility of PVSCs using M1 (Fig. S12, ESI). When processing M0 and M1 with EA as the green solvent, both layers can form a smooth and uniform surface morphology as revealed by AFM images (Fig. S11, ESI). Inverted PVSCs based on EA-processed M0 and M1 were also fabricated and characterized. Encouragingly, a high PCE of 19.21% in the reverse scan, with a Voc of 1.07 V, a Jsc of 21.78 mA cm−2 and an FF of 82.51% with negligible hysteresis, is obtained for the M1-based PVSC. To the best of our knowledge, 19.21% is the highest value among the inverted PVSCs based on HTMs with EA as the processing solvent. Besides, a comparable PCE of 18.33% is realized for the M0-based device with EA processing. Moreover, the EQE spectra (Fig. 5e) and stabilized PCE tracking at the MPP (Fig. 5f) were also investigated to validate the EA-processed devices, and both matched well with the J–V curves. Also, the statistical photovoltaic parameters of the EA-processed M1-based PVSCs are narrower than those of the M0-based PVSCs (Fig. S13, ESI).

To investigate possible reasons for the enhanced Voc and FF of the devices, photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the perovskite films deposited on M0 and M1 were obtained to investigate the hole extraction and charge recombination in the perovskite and at the HTM/perovskite interfaces, respectively. The PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) results are plotted in Fig. 6. All the PL emission peaks are located at 774 nm, and efficient PL quenching occurs in both the M0/perovskite film and the M1/perovskite film compared with the perovskite film on ITO (Fig. 6a). In particular, the PL of the perovskite film can be quenched by M1 more efficiently than by M0, which may result from either more efficient hole transfer between the perovskite and the HTM or more severe charge recombination due to trap/defects at the perovskite/HTMs interfaces. We conducted the TRPL of these three perovskite films to further study the charge carrier lifetimes. As shown in Fig. 6b, a bi-exponential decay model was selected to fit the TRPL spectra for three films, and the corresponding fitting parameters are collected and displayed in Table 3. The fast lifetime (τ1) refers to charge transfer quenching of the PL or the monomolecular defect-driven recombination rate, while the slow lifetime (τ2) indicates the non-radiative charge recombination in perovskite films. M1/perovskite exhibits a shorter τ1 of 9.0 ns than M0/perovskite (12.4 ns) and ITO/perovskite (15.8 ns). Furthermore, the portion of τ1 sharply decreases from 24.3% in M0/perovskite to 12.1% in M1/perovskite. These indicate reduced defect densities, and hole transfer is more efficient at the interface from the perovskite to M1 than from teh perovskite to M0. Besides, the τ2 value of the ITO/perovskite was 112.9 ns. The τ2 value for the perovskite films on M0 is 26.0 ns, while the moderately increased τ2 value is 35.4 ns for the perovskite on M1, which implies that M1 effectively suppresses non-radiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers from the perovskite films. TRPL results suggest that the enhanced hole extraction and reduced non-radiative recombination of the M1-based PVSC could account for the higher Voc and FF than the M0-based PVSC.

The long-term stability of PVSCs is significant for practical application. We evaluated the device stability of M0- and M1-based PVSCs under an ambient environment (Fig. 7a). Although both unencapsulated devices degraded in a highly humid environment due to the air- and water-sensitive nature of the perovskite, it is evident that the M1-based devices are more robust than the M0-based devices. M1-based PVSCs can maintain over 75% of the initial PCE after 120 hours of storage while it is only 34% for the M0-based devices (relative humidity 45–55%, 25 °C). Also, a better on-shelf stability of the M1-based devices is achieved with a PCE above 95% under an inert atmosphere after storage for 2400 hours under dark conditions. In contrast, the relatively low stability of M0-based devices is observed with the decline of PCE to only 80% of its initial value (Fig. 7b), which may result from the uniform and compact morphology of perovskite on M1 for protecting the perovskite from air and water permeation, while perovskite on M0 contains many pinholes.

In summary, we propose a new strategy for introducing bidentate ligands into HTMs, here, a new dopant-free SM-HTM with a planar bidentate ligand as the core unit and TPA groups as the peripheral co-units, M1, was designed and synthesized via a facile one-step Suzuki coupling reaction. Although M1 and its control molecule M0 without a bidentate ligand show similar photophysical properties and hole mobility, M1 contains 1,10-phenanthroline that can chelate to Pb2+ ion defects at the M1/perovskite interface. Taking advantage of its appropriate energy level alignment, interface passivation, and uniform morphology of the perovskite films on the HTM substrate, M1-based inverted PVSCs achieved an optimal PCE of 20.14% with negligible hysteresis, which is much higher than that (18.32%) of the control device. Notably, devices based on M1 processed using EA reached a PCE of 19.21%, which is among the highest values reported for inverted PVSCs with green-solvent-processed SM-HTMs. Our results suggest that constructing SM-HTMs with versatile bidentate ligand cores shows potential for developing low-cost, ecofriendly-processable, and dopant-free HTMs toward highly efficient PVSCs.
