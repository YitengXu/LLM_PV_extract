An acid-sensitive semiperfluoroalkyl resorcinarene has recently been demonstrated as an effective photoresist for the photolithographic patterning of organic semiconductor materials. In this work, we show that it can be used to pattern polymer solar cells fabricated from a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), so as to obtain high open circuit voltages (Voc). An array of 300 solar cells in series, with a period of 50 µm, achieved a Voc of 90 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.3%.

Interest in high-voltage solar cells is motivated by applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which typically require driving voltages of tens to hundreds of volts. Such solar cells provide a self-contained power supply that allows for autonomous MEMS applications. These solar cells were fabricated from amorphous silicon, and achieved voltages above 100 volts by connecting miniaturized cells in series.

Recently, a high-voltage polymer solar cell fabricated from a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been demonstrated by Niggemann et al. The P3HT:PCBM system represent one of the most promising material sets for organic solar cells, achieving efficiencies of around 5%. Application of organic semiconductors for high-voltage solar cells has the advantage of potential low-cost roll-to-roll fabrication. In addition, they can be easily integrated into organic electronic applications to provide on-board power for organic thin film transistors, which typically require operating voltages of tens of volts.
To achieve high-voltage in a small area, the individual solar cells in the array need to be small (of the order of microns), hence patterning methods with high resolution are needed. Photolithography is an attractive technique, since it is well-established in the semiconductor industry and it can easily achieve sub-micron feature size. However, it is challenging to pattern organic electronic materials, as many of the processing steps in photolithography involve the use of solvents that can damage the organic layers. Niggemann et al. got around this problem by photolithographically patterning the electrodes first before spin-coating the active layer on top. With sub-micron spacing between the electrodes, they achieved a 880 volt solar cell with a total electrode distance of just 17.4 mm. However, their device architecture requires the active material to be sandwiched in a planar configuration between the electrodes, and a rather low power conversion efficiency of 0.008% was reported. Lewis et al. demonstrated another approach that utilized shadow masks to pattern top aluminum electrodes in series. In this way, they were able to fabricate devices in the standard vertical configuration, which achieved a voltage of 7.8 volts and a power conversion efficiency of 0.06% for an array of 18 P3HT:PCBM cells. However, it is difficult to achieve small features with shadow masking, and mask alignment is also a challenge.
Here we demonstrate a technique that can be used to directly pattern the organic active layer by photolithography in order to achieve high voltages. Previously, we have shown that an acid-sensitive semiperfluoroalkyl resorcinarene is an effective photoresist for the photolithographic patterning of organic semiconductor materials. The resorcinarene is soluble in hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), which were found to be completely benign to non-fluorinated organic electronic materials. Hence, the resorcinarene can be spin-coated directly on top of the organic active layer as a photoresist. An array of 300 P3HT:PCBM solar cells was patterned and connected in series, achieving an open circuit voltage (Voc) of almost 90 volts. With this technique, it is possible to achieve high resolution using photolithography, and also incorporate the standard device architecture that has been optimized for polymer solar cells.

A schematic of the device fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1. Glass substrates with unpatterned 15 Ω/sq indium tin oxide (ITO) (Kintec, Hong Kong) were cleaned by sonication in mild detergent, rinsed in de-ionized water, dried in a nitrogen stream and treated with a 10 min UV-ozone exposure. The ITO was then patterned with standard photolithographic techniques. Shipley 1813 photoresist was spin-coated onto the ITO, which was then selectively exposed using a HTG System III-HR Contact Aligner before being developed with AZ 300 MIF developer. The patterned photoresist was used as a mask for the wet etching of ITO by hydrochloric acid, which yielded an array of 300 ITO electrodes with a width of 40 µm and a 10 µm gap between electrodes (hence a 50 µm period). Residual photoresist was removed with acetone and isopropanol (IPA).

The ITO array was cleaned once again by the same process as described above. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PH 500) was then spin-coated on top at 6000 rpm, and then baked on the hot-plate at 170 °C for 4 min. P3HT (American Dye Source) was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 17 mg/ml, to which PCBM (Nano-C) was added at a concentration of 10 mg/ml (for a total of 27 mg/ml). The P3HT:PCBM blend was spin-coated at 600 rpm on top of the PEDOT:PSS to give a film about 200 nm thick.
The molecular structures of the materials used for the fluorinated photoresist are shown in Fig. 2. A mixture of the resorcinarene and a small amount of photoacid generator (20:1 by weight) was dissolved in a 5:2 solvent mixture of HFE 7500 (3M) and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) at a concentration of 20% by weight. The purpose of PGMEA was to improve the solubility of the resorcinarene. PGMEA was found to have only a small effect on the performance of P3HT transistors, and had been utilized in the photolithographic patterning of P3HT. This formulation was spin-coated on top of the P3HT:PCBM layer at 1000 rpm to form a photoresist about 1 µm thick.
The photoresist was patterned by selective exposure with a GCA Autostep 200 DSW i-line Wafer Stepper, baked at 70 °C for a minute, and then developed using HFE 7200 (3M) solvent. The patterned photoresist was then used as a mask for the dry etching of the P3HT:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS layers by oxygen plasma with a Oxford PlasmaLab 80 + RIE System. The residual photoresist was stripped by dipping the films into HFE 7200 with 10% IPA. The addition of a small amount of IPA allows the HFE 7200 to dissolve the previously insoluble parts of the photoresist. The patterned active layer was designed to have a 5 µm offset with respect to the ITO, so that the effective width of the active region was 35 µm. Since the array had a period of 50 µm, this implied that the active region was 70% of the total cell area. An image of the patterned ITO electrodes and active layers is shown in Fig. 3(a).
Finally, 4 Å of CsF and 300 Å of Al were deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (1 × 10−6 torr) to create top electrodes with a width of 3 mm. The substrate was tilted at an angle of 45° with respect to the incoming stream of Al atoms (as shown in Fig. 1) so that the Al will not come into contact with the bottom ITO as a result of the shadowing effect by the P3HT:PCBM active layer. However, the Al electrode will be in contact with the ITO electrode of the adjacent cell, hence forming a series connection. The final configuration is an array of 300 solar cells in series, with a total length of 15 mm and width of 3 mm, which gives a total cell area of 45 mm2. A plan view of the completed device is shown in Fig. 3(b).
For solar cell characterization, current–voltage (I–V) curves were obtained with a Keithley 236 source-measurement-unit (SMU) under AM 1.5 100 mW/cm2 illumination from a Solar Light 16S-002 solar simulator. The light output power was calibrated using a Newport 818P-010-12 thermopile high power detector, which has a flat response over a broad spectral range. Spectral mismatch was not taken into account in these measurements.

Various solar cell parameters, such as the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated from the I–V curves. The device was annealed at 160 °C on a hotplate for 80 min, and was tested several times during the course of the annealing process. Solar cell characteristics as a function of annealing time are tabulated in Table 1. The cell had a negligible VOC before thermal annealing, which is likely to be a result of imperfect Al shadowing by the active layer, creating microscopic shorts across the devices. A brief thermal annealing (8 min) caused the VOC to increase dramatically from 0.36 volts to 65.4 volts. Thermal annealing had been shown to lead to a restructuring of the organic layers, which will help eliminate microscopic shorts. The highest PCE of 0.44% was achieved after 16 min of annealing, which is significantly better than previously reported values for high-voltage polymer cells. Further annealing decreased the PCE to 0.31%, but VOC increased steadily to reach 89.6 volts after 80 min. This increase in VOC with thermal annealing is reproducible and had been observed for cells with different thicknesses of the Al cathode. Evaporating a thick layer of Al will worsen the problem of microscopic shorts and lead to a lower final VOC, while reducing the thickness will increase series resistance. The thickness reported here (300 Å) was found to be optimum.

The final current–voltage curve of the solar cell array under AM 1.5 100 mW/cm2 illumination is shown in Fig. 4(a). The average voltage per cell is 0.3 volts, while the current density for a single cell in the array is 4.2 mA/cm2 (assuming that each cell contributes the same current). The poor fill factor of 0.3 is likely due to the high series resistance RS, which is estimated to be 1 × 105 Ω cm−2. This is perhaps to be expected, since there are 300 ITO-organic and 300 organic-metal junctions. In order to make a comparison, a single stand-alone 3 mm2 P3HT:PCBM cell was fabricated under essentially the same conditions as the solar cell array but without the photolithographic patterning steps. The current–voltage curve of this cell is shown in Fig. 4(b). It achieved a VOC of 0.60 volts, JSC of 7.0 mA/cm2, FF of 0.59 and a PCE of 2.48%, with a series resistance RS ≈ 3 Ω cm−2. Thus, both the voltage and current values of a single cell in the solar cell array are at least half that of the stand-alone cell, which indicates that the array device architecture does not suffer from a huge performance drop. Even with the low fill factor taken into account, the PCE is still a fairly respectable 0.3%, and compares favorably with previous reports of high-voltage organic solar cells. This result also indicates that the P3HT:PCBM layer can undergo oxygen plasma treatment while it is protected by the fluorinated photoresist, thus the P3HT:PCBM system may be more robust than previously thought.

A high-voltage polymer solar cell array was successfully patterned using photolithography. The array produced an open circuit voltage approaching 90 volts, with a power conversion efficiency of 0.3% under AM 1.5 100 mW/cm2 illumination. The VOC and JSC of a single cell in the 300-cell array are shown to be at least half that of a single stand-alone cell fabricated under similar conditions. This indicates that photolithographic patterningvia perfluorinated resocinarene photoresist is a viable technique for the fabrication of high-voltage polymer solar cells.
