Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is usually used as an ETL in n–i–p structure PSCs. It requires high temperature preparation, which limits commercialization of PSCs. Herein, we present a perovskite oxide SrGeO3 as a new and superior ETL which can directly replace TiO2. We synthesized SrGeO3 by a low temperature hydrothermal method and applied it as an ETL for the first time in PSCs. SrGeO3 is an excellent candidate to serve as an ETL in PSCs owing to its excellent solution processability at low temperature. SrGeO3 is about 2 times more conductive than TiO2. In addition, the energy level of the SrGeO3 thin film matches those of the other functional layers in the device, indicating the suitability of SrGeO3 as an ETL in PSCs. Finally, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices prepared by using the perovskite SrGeO3 as an ETL reached 17.68% and demonstrated good stability.

The rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of mixed organic–inorganic halide PSCs has created a huge research boom in the photovoltaic (PV) industry. At present, the PCE of PSCs has exceeded 22%. The improvement of the PV performance of PSCs is mainly attributed to the inherent properties of perovskite materials, such as an adjustable band gap, high optical absorption coefficient, and high current carrier mobility. High efficiency PSCs typically use an electron-transporting layer (ETL) and a hole-blocking layer to separate and collect photogenerated charge carriers present in the absorber layer. Among them, the ETL is essential for achieving efficient and stable PSCs. Also, the electrical and optical properties of the ETL can significantly affect the performance of the PSCs. To date, TiO2 is a widely used electron-transporting layer in n–i–p structure PSCs, with TiO2 yielding higher efficiency. Nevertheless, the optical and electronic properties of TiO2 have some shortcomings which have contributed to the limitations of PSCs. For example, the low electron mobility of TiO2 and the surface adsorption of oxygen and ultraviolet light are likely to affect the long-term stability of the PSCs and limit their PCE. To address these challenges, immense research work has been carried out to modify or replace the ETL and improve the film quality of the absorber layer, the power conversion efficiency and the stability of PSCs. Other semiconductors such as SnO2, ZnO, and Zn2SnO4 (ref. 26–28) have been investigated as potential replacements for TiO2. Although significant progress has been made, issues such as poor chemical stability and high processing temperature still exist.

SrGeO3 is a perovskite oxide with a wide band gap of 3.67 eV. As an important rare metal citrate one-dimensional nanomaterial, SrGeO3 nanowires have a good application prospect in the field of optics and photocatalysis. We found that SrGeO3 nanowires synthesized by a hydrothermal method showed a good conductivity of 0.14 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is 2 times larger than that (0.06 S cm−1) for TiO2 deposited from a titanium tetrachloride precursor based on hydrolysis. The fabricated n–i–p structure CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells by employing SrGeO3 as an ETL presented a PCE as high as 17.68%, which is comparable with those of TiO2-based devices.

GeO2 and (CH3CH2O2)2Sr were weighed at a molar ratio of 1:2, dissolved in 60 ml of deionized water and stirred uniformly. The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave with a capacity of 100 ml. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. It was thereafter cooled to room temperature in air. The product was washed and dried in air at 80 °C to obtain a white powder of SrGeO3. 10 mg of SrGeO3 was then dispersed in 1 ml CH3CN. TiO2 was grown onto FTO substrates by using 4 ml titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and 200 ml water as the precursors. MAI (190 mg) and PbI2 (553 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone (GBL):dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (7:3, v/v) to get the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by mixing 25 μl of TFSI–Li solution (520 mg ml−1) and 35 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine with 80 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 ml chlorobenzene.


The SrGeO3 dispersion was deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by spin-coating. The samples were baked at 100 °C for 20 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated on the SrGeO3 layer at 4000 rpm for 60 s. During the spin-coating process, chlorobenzene (anti-solvent) was added dropwise on the film. The samples were then baked at 100 °C for 10 min. Spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s without annealing. Finally, MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were sequentially vacuum-evaporated on the samples at a rate of 0.4 Å s−1 and 2 Å s−1. The final device had a structure of FTO/SrGeO3 (TiO2)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm).

The surface morphology of the films was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI Co). The J–V characteristics of PSCs were obtained using a programmable Keithley 2400 Series Source Meter under AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films were obtained using a PANalytical 80 equipment (Empyrean, Cu Kα radiation). The energy levels of SrGeO3 were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite films on different ETLs were collected using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 with a 480 nm excitation wavelength. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by using an IM6e Electrochemical Workstation (ZAHNER, Germany). The contact angles of the grid lines were measured by using a PSS OCA20 optical contact-measuring system.


Fig. 1a shows a transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of SrGeO3. It can be seen that SrGeO3 prepared by the hydrothermal method has a one-dimensional linear structure with a diameter of 10–30 nm. The length ranges from tens to hundreds of microns. Fig. 1b shows a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of the prepared SrGeO3 nanowires. Clear lattice fringes can be seen, indicating that the prepared nanowires have good crystallinity. Calculations show the interplanar spacing of the (121) and (133) crystal faces to be 0.46 and 0.33 nm, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is the main technical means for analyzing the chemical composition of the compound.

The full XPS spectrum survey of the prepared SrGeO3 film is given in Fig. S1 (ESI), showing the presence of O, Sr and Ge in the compound. Fig. 2a shows the O 1s core level with a binding energy of 531.5 eV. Fig. 2b shows the Sr 3d core level with the binding energies of 135.35 eV and 133.65 eV, corresponding to the Sr 3d3/2 and Sr 3d5/2 core levels, respectively. Fig. 2c shows the Ge 3d core level. The binding energies of 32.3 eV and 38.0 eV correspond to Ge 3d5/2 and Ge 3d7/2 core levels, respectively. Fig. 2d shows the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum of the SrGeO3 film. It can be seen that the FTIR spectrum of SrGeO3 exhibits strong characteristic peaks of stretching and bending vibrations of the Ge–O–Sr bond at the positions of 748 cm−1 and 530 cm−1, respectively. The combination of XPS and FTIR characteristics indicates the formation of a crystal phase for the prepared SrGeO3.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the SrGeO3 nanowires is shown in Fig. 2e. By comparing with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card, the synthesized SrGeO3 nanowire is an orthorhombic phase (JCPDS card, card number: 27-0845). According to the XRD spectrum, the synthesized SrGeO3 did not possess impure phases other than the pure orthorhombic phase, indicating the high purity of SrGeO3. In addition, the conductivities of SrGeO3 and TiO2 (from the titanium tetrachloride precursor based on hydrolysis) films at varied temperatures were measured as shown in Fig. 2f. We used a four-probe tester to measure the sheet resistance of the film heated at different temperatures; before testing, we set the correction factor according to the ratio of film thickness to probe pitch. The resistivity and conductivity are obtained according to the formula: ρ = R × W × D (R: sheet resistance, W: thickness of the film, and D: correction coefficient). σ = 1/ρ (σ: conductivity and ρ: resistivity). The conductivities of SrGeO3 and TiO2 films were 0.14 S cm−1 and 0.06 S cm−1 at room temperature (25 °C), respectively. And the conductivities of SrGeO3 and TiO2 films were 0.29 S cm−1 and 0.21 S cm−1 at the temperature (100 °C) required to prepare the film.
To check whether the energy levels of SrGeO3 match those of perovskite layers in the device, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted on the compound (ESI, Fig. S2). In the UPS spectrum, the secondary electron cutoff is located at 16.73 eV, indicating that the photon energy of 21.2 eV can excite electrons of 16.73 eV. Further calculation shows that the work function of SrGeO3 is 4.43 eV, indicating a good energy level matching with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer. It means that the deposited SrGeO3 film could act as an effective electron-transporting layer from the viewpoint of energy level matching.
To investigate the effect of different underlayers on the growth of the perovskite films, the contact angles of SrGeO3 and TiO2 films were measured by adding dropwise the perovskite solution onto the SrGeO3 and TiO2 films. The droplets on the SrGeO3 and TiO2 films produced contact angles of 31.1° and 51.9°, respectively (ESI, Fig. S3). The better affinity of the SrGeO3 film would facilitate the deposition of the perovskite film. Fig. 3a and b show the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on TiO2 and SrGeO3, respectively. Compared with the TiO2 based reference film, the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on SrGeO3 had better crystallinity with a larger grain size. Since the crystallization of the perovskite film directly determines the overall performance of the perovskite solar cells, the SrGeO3-based device is expected to demonstrate high efficiency.
Further studies on the crystallization characteristics of the perovskite films were carried out by XRD. Fig. 3c shows the XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on the TiO2 and SrGeO3 underlayers. Both perovskite films exhibited a cubic perovskite phase crystal structure with (110), (220) and (310) peaks. Compared to the perovskite film deposited on TiO2, the SrGeO3 based perovskite film presented a significantly enhanced peak intensity of the (110) crystal plane. This indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on SrGeO3 could preferentially grow along the <110> crystal orientation. This preferred growth orientation will favor the crystallization of the perovskite absorber layer. In order to explore the crystal qualities of the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on SrGeO3 and TiO2, the total density of states (tDOS) and their distributions in both SrGeO3 and TiO2 based perovskite solar cells were evaluated by thermal admittance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3d, the traps were reduced in the shallow energy region between 0.30 and 0.45 eV in the SrGeO3 based device. This provides direct evidence that the SrGeO3 underlayer could favor the growth of high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films.
To investigate the effect of the SrGeO3 ETL on the device performance of perovskite solar cells, PSCs with an n–i–p structure of FTO/SrGeO3 (TiO2)/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag (as shown in Fig. 4a) were fabricated. Upon optimization, the device based on 10 mg ml−1 SrGeO3 in CH3CN delivered the best cell performance (ESI, Fig. S4). Fig. 4b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of SrGeO3 and TiO2 based PSCs under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Table 1 summarizes the cell parameters of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE in SrGeO3 and TiO2 based PSCs. The TiO2 based reference device shows a PCE of 17.50% with a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 22.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.74. In the case of 5 mg ml−1 SrGeO3, the device presented a PCE of 15.96% with a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 21.89 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.68. The lower PCE is ascribed to the discontinuous SrGeO3 film due to the smaller concentration. By increasing the concentration of SrGeO3 to 10 mg ml−1, the cell parameters of Voc, Jsc and FF are increased to 1.08 V, 22.65 mA cm−2, and 0.71, respectively, giving a champion PCE of 17.68%. A series of SrGeO3 and TiO2 based PSCs were fabricated to confirm the efficiency reproducibility. The corresponding histogram of PCEs indicates that the SrGeO3 ETL could provide a higher PCE than the TiO2 based one (ESI, Fig. S5). In addition, the SrGeO3 ETL based PSCs also presented a small current hysteresis by comparing their forward and reverse J–V curves (ESI, Fig. S6). Fig. 4c shows steady state photocurrents in TiO2 and SrGeO3 based PSCs, measured at the maximum power points of 0.84 V and 0.80 V, respectively. The current densities were respectively stabilized at 21.68 mA cm−2 (TiO2 based device) and 22.02 mA cm−2 (SrGeO3 based device), which are very close to the values obtained from the J–V curves.

To investigate the electron extraction at the interface of SrGeO3 (TiO2)/CH3NH3PbI3, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of SrGeO3/CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 samples were measured as shown in Fig. 4d. The lifetime of SrGeO3/CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 samples is 43.88 ns and 51.63 ns, respectively. Compared to the sample of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3, the sample of SrGeO3/CH3NH3PbI3 exhibited a shorter carrier lifetime. This means that there was efficient electron extraction from the perovskite layer to the SrGeO3 layer. The steady-state PL spectra of both samples were recorded by exciting at 480 nm as shown in Fig. 4e. The appearance of more serious PL quenching indicates that the SrGeO3 ETL could favor more electron extraction from the perovskite layer than the TiO2 ETL. In order to further investigate the electrical properties of TiO2 and SrGeO3 based PSC devices, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on both the devices. Fig. 4f shows the Nyquist plot of both devices at an applied voltage of 0.95 V. The calculated charge transfer resistances (RCT) in TiO2- and SrGeO3-based PSCs were 1160 Ω and 625 Ω, respectively. A smaller RCT value indicates a better interface contact between the SrGeO3 ETL and CH3NH3PbI3 layer.
In addition, the stability of the perovskite solar cells is also associated with the interfacial layers. Fig. 5 shows the stability tests of TiO2-based and SrGeO3-based PSCs without encapsulation in an ambient environment (humidity: 25–35%, temperature: 25 °C, indoor light source, and active area: 0.09 cm2). After nearly 1000 hours of storage in an ambient environment, the PCE of the SrGeO3-based device only reduced to 60% of its initial value. However, it rapidly decreased to 19% of the initial PCE in the SrGeO3-based device.

We have synthesized an oxide perovskite of SrGeO3 with excellent conductivity and stability by a low-temperature hydrothermal method. The composition and purity of the synthesized material were initially ascertained. The film conductivity of SrGeO3 is about 2 times higher than that of TiO2 at room temperature. And the energy levels of the SrGeO3 film are well matched with those of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer, indicating its suitability as an ETL in perovskite solar cells. Consequently, a champion n–i–p structure device with a PCE as high as 17.68% was obtained. The developed solution-processable inorganic oxide perovskite of SrGeO3 provides the diversification of ETLs in planar PSCs.
