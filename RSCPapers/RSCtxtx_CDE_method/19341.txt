Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine the advantages of superior optical and electronic properties and solution-processed manufacturing, have emerged as a new class of revolutionary optoelectronic devices with the potential for various practical applications. Encouraged by the advantages of longer carrier diffusion length, higher carrier mobility and potential for better optoelectronic properties than their polycrystalline counterparts, increasing research attention has focused on the preparation and optimization of single crystal candidates, using various solution synthesis techniques to control the morphology, for the development of a wide range of optoelectronic applications. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advances in the field of optoelectronic and sensing technologies based on different forms of single crystals, including bulk crystals and thin samples, with an emphasis placed on the optimization of the crystals and the relationship among the charge-carrier transport, operation mechanism, device architecture, and device performance. First, we present the main methods used to prepare bulk and thin single crystals and analyze several aspects of their properties. Thereafter, the applications of single crystals in solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, lasers, as well as sensors and transistors, are discussed in depth. Finally, we summarize the merits and demerits of perovskite single crystals and propose further improvements in the synthesis approaches and device applications.

Perovskite materials, which were first discovered in the 1830s and were named after Russian mineralogist L. A. Perovski, have received increasing attention from researchers because of their special structure and rich physical properties. As shown in Fig. 1, the general chemical formula for perovskite compounds is ABX3, where A and B are two cations with different atomic sizes, and X is an anion that bonds to both the A and B cations. Perovskite materials exhibit a series of interesting and attractive properties, which include colossal magnetoresistance, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, charge ordering, spin-dependent transport, high thermopower, and an interplay of structural, magnetic and transport properties. Moreover, from an application point of view, this materials family is also widely used as sensors and catalyst electrodes in certain types of fuel cells, and the members are candidates for memory devices and spintronic applications, as well as microelectronics and telecommunication.

Owing to the flexibility of the bond angles inherent in the perovskite structure, there are many different types of distortions that can occur from the ideal structure. More importantly, A can be methylammonium (MA+) or formamidinium (FA+), B can be metal ions, such as Pb2+ and Sn2+, and X is usually halide ions, and such a class of materials is known as organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs). In 2009, Kojima et al. made the first attempt to employ halide-based perovskite films as active sensitizers into photovoltaic devices using a volatile liquid electrolyte. From then on, OIHP polycrystalline films have been widely applied to solar cells with various structures such as planar heterojunctions, mesoscopic heterojunctions, bilayer architectures, and meso-superstructured single-junctions. Hybrid perovskite solar cells have continued to set new efficiency benchmarks, and their relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased to as high as 25.2%. Leveraging the excellent fabrication and photo-physical properties, such as cost effectiveness, ease of processing, tunable optical band gaps, long charge carrier diffusion length, and low trap density, as well as large light-absorption coefficients and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency, hybrid perovskites also have the potential for employment in other optoelectronic applications, which include photodetectors, transistors, water photolysis, phototransistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and lasers.
However, a vast array of prior research on hybrid perovskite optoelectronic devices has been centered on polycrystalline thin films. The perovskite polycrystalline samples usually suffer from grain boundaries, relatively higher trap density and defects, and low stability, which would obviously affect their potential performance in optoelectronic applications. More recently, researchers have paid more attention to hybrid perovskite single crystals, which possess the promising features of no grain boundaries, relatively low trap density, large charge carrier mobility, and long carrier diffusion length. Intensive studies on perovskite single crystals have also revealed dramatically enhanced carrier recombination lifetimes and carrier mobilities, as well as extremely low defects. In this regard, extensive efforts are being devoted to developing effective methods to improve the perovskite crystal quality and optimize the device performance. Existing in the form of bulk or thin crystals, OIHP single crystal samples have been widely applied in various applications, like optoelectronics and sensors, and have made rapid and great strides in research progress. There already are excellent review papers that consider a wide range from bulk crystals to various nanocrystals and cover the fundamental physical properties and a range of device applications. Each of these review papers has a different line of narrative, focus, and depth. However, reviews centered on optimized perovskite crystals and their new optoelectronic/electronic and sensing applications are limited.
In this review, we aim to summarize the recent achievements, ongoing progress, and the challenges to date in the area of methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) single crystals from the perspective of both materials and devices, with an emphasis placed on the photovoltaic, photo-detection, emitting, and sensing properties, and provide an outlook on the opportunities offered by this emerging family of optoelectronic materials in the field of optoelectronics and sensing applications. An overview is first provided on the growth approaches of bulk and thin perovskite single crystals with a particular focus on the space-controlled strategies. The subsequent section comprehensively reviews the structure characterizations and the intrinsic physical properties of these materials. We particularly address their optoelectronic properties related to the requirements for detection and sensing applications. Their exploitation and progress in a variety of device applications are then highlighted starting with a description of the optoelectronic devices followed by the recent developments in sensors as well as transistors and logic circuits. The challenges for developing large-scaled and stable optoelectronic/electronic applications and sensing devices based on perovskite crystals with high-performance are discussed in detail. Finally, a brief outlook on these issues and challenges is presented and the future perspectives are also proposed to design new device architectures for special applications in the future.

Recently, various growth techniques have been adopted to grow halide-based perovskite single crystals, which include organic–inorganic and all-inorganic perovskite single crystals. However, as for the MA-based OIHP single crystals, there are usually three classical growth methods, which are very simple and attractive strategies to synthesize the perovskite single crystals. These methods are the solution temperature-lowering (STL) method, inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method, and temperature-independent anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method. Furthermore, the main approaches that are employed to grow thin perovskite single crystals are also highlighted in this section.


According to the lower solubility of MAPbX3 in HX (X = Cl, Br, and I) solution as the temperature decreases, Tao's group introduced the STL method to synthesize a MAPbI3 bulk single crystal (see Fig. 2a). After the reaction between methylamine (CH3NH2) and hydroiodic acid (HI) in a cold atmosphere, the obtained white microcrystal methyl-ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was reacted with Pb(CH3COOH)2·3H2O in aqueous HI, and the solution was then cooled from 65 to 40 °C. A 10 mm × 10 mm × 8 mm black CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal was grown in about one month, as shown in Fig. 2b. For a reaction with a shorter time, a 12 mm × 12 mm × 7 mm MAPbI3 single crystal was fabricated by Sun's group within 15 days after lowering the temperature of the prepared solution with seed crystals from 100 °C to 53 °C, as shown in Fig. 2c. Moreover, Lin's group discovered a more efficient way, and synthesized CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals with a size of 5 mm in around 10 days, as shown in Fig. 2d. This growth method enabled easy growth of seed crystals, which were 2–3 mm in size, but not the easy growth of bulk crystals with larger sizes. Encouragingly, minimizing the number of nuclei was shown to be useful to overcome this problem, so they selected seeds with high quality and dropped them back into solution, and single crystals sized up to 1 cm were obtained, as shown in Fig. 2e and f. Furthermore, the X component in the perovskite ABX3 structure can also be a mixed halide. MAPbBr3−xClx and MAPbI3−xBrx mixed-halide perovskite single crystals were studied using this method by Huang's group. According to the reaction: CH3NH2 + HX + PbX2 → CH3NH3PbX3 (X can be Cl, Br, or I), they mixed hydrobromic acid with hydrochloric acid or hydroiodic acid in different molar ratios and added methylamine and lead(II) acetate solution to fabricate single-halide and mixed-halide perovskite single crystals, as shown in Fig. 2g. The supersaturated precursor solution was gradually cooled to synthesize single crystals in several days. The time-consumption factor is the biggest drawback of this method, which has led to the domination of other crystallization methods.


As a radically faster OIHP single crystal synthesis approach, the ITC method has widely been applied in recent years. Using this method, a vast array of perovskite single crystals has been reported owing to the inverse solubility of the material at a high temperature and faster growth rate of the crystals. Moreover, it was observed that the reported crystals can be shape-controlled and obtained more quickly and are of higher quality compared with the other growth techniques. Three kinds of solvent were introduced in the crystallization technique: γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Additionally, the solubility of MAPbI3 in GBL and MAPbBr3 in DMF was changed with the variation of temperature, as shown in Fig. 3a. Generally, a high temperature can help to precipitate MAPbBr3 in DMF, MAPbCl3 in DMSO, and MAPbI3 in GBL. Bakr and his group introduced this method to rapidly grow high-quality bulk single crystals based on the different solubility of MAPbX3 perovskites in various solutions at different temperatures. To grow MAPbBr3, they added PbBr2 and MABr in DMF at room temperature and heated it in an oil bath to 80 °C. The iodide solution was prepared at 60 °C and heated to 110 °C. As shown in Fig. 3b, an orange crystal of MAPbBr3 and a black crystal of MAPbI3 were grown within 3 hours and the crystals were moved carefully to fresh precursors.

For this method, the effect of the molar ratio of MAX and PbX2 in the precursor solutions on the crystal quality was also studied by Chen's group. Using a similar ITC method, they investigated a MAX:PbX2 from 1:1 to 2:1, and perovskite single crystals with different sizes and shapes were obtained after a 6-hour crystallization process, as shown in Fig. 3c. They also found that the increase of organic content can inhibit the size of MAPbBr3 crystals and influence both the size and shape of MAPbI3 crystals. Moreover, when the molar ratio reached over 1.8:1, the MAPbI3 changed to be polycrystals, which showed defects resulting from the organic content during the crystallization process.
With the aim of growing a large-sized bulk single crystal of perovskite, the ITC method was further modified. Under this technique, the strategy of the incorporation of seed crystal growth has been proven to be favorable for organic–inorganic perovskite single crystals as large as convenient. Liu's group reported various large sized single crystals of organic–inorganic perovskites using the modified ITC method. The large sized and high-quality single crystals were grown by the following stepwise process: in the first step, a number of seed crystals were prepared through repeating and carefully controlling the ITC process several times. Upon choosing some good quality seed crystals and placing them into the freshly prepared precursor solution, the original small-sized seed can be grown into a larger (7 mm) size; using this larger seed crystal as a new seed, the process can be repeated and much larger single crystals are obtained. Moreover, Liu's group also successfully grew CH3NH3Pb(BrxI1−x)3 single crystals with a finely-tuned bandgap. To overcome the difficulty of preparing dual-halide perovskite single crystals with different precursors using a single solvent, they optimized both precursors, as shown in Fig. 3d. They mixed a MAPbBr3 (0.7 M) solution with MAPbI3 (1.3 M) in different volume ratios and slowly heated the solution from ∼50 °C to ∼90 °C, and the grown single crystals are shown in Fig. 3e. The application of the different solubilities of different OIHP single crystals at varying temperatures contributes to the time-saving feature of the ITC method.

Another main method to grow OIHP single crystals is the AVC method, which was first introduced to grow hybrid perovskite crystals by Bakr's group, as shown in Fig. 4a. In this method, the solvent plays a significant role because two or more solvents have to be selected; one should be a good solvent, which is less volatile, and the other is a bad solvent, which is more volatile. The precursors of the halide perovskite will be dissolved in a small vial of the good solvent. This vial will be placed in a large vial containing the bad solvent and then sealed. The principle of this method can be described as follows: when the bad solvent slowly diffuses into the precursor solution, the proficiency of the crystal formation increases at the bottom of the sample vial owing to the insolubility of the material in the bad solvent. According to the poor ability to form hydrogen bonds of dichloromethane (DCM) and insolubility of MAX and PbX2 in the anti-solvent DCM, they evaporated DCM slowly into DMF with PbBr2 and MABr (1:1 by mole) or GBL with PbI2 and MAI (1:3 by mole). Single crystals can be obtained within about one week, as shown in Fig. 4b and c. Other groups, like Loi's group and Cao's group, also applied this method. They put DMF or GBL in a vial, which was sealed with foil but with a small hole, and the vial was placed in an atmosphere of DCM. Although the AVC method takes more time than the ITC method, its temperature-irrelevant characteristic is appealing to its widespread use.

These three different kinds of growing techniques have their own features, which are summarized in Table 1. Generally, the STL method is a more time-consuming process; however, the size of single crystals prepared by this method can be larger than those made by the other two methods. The ITC method can be regarded as the most efficient method, as it takes less than 3 hours. The most prominent feature for the AVC method is that it can be operated at room temperature.

As shown above, there are many simple methods to grow and synthesize bulk single crystals; however, their thick active layer may cause an increase of charge recombination, which will lead to the degradation of their device performance. Moreover, the bulk form of perovskite single crystals also impedes the practical device applications. In this regard, growing thin perovskite single crystals with a large area represents an effective approach to overcome the above obstacles and thus advances further practical applications. Thin perovskite crystals first appeared in the form of polycrystalline films, which have been synthesized into a monocrystal film through several ways in recent years. Thin single crystal films are hard to deposit in solution on account of their volatile fragile organic component and brittle inorganic framework. Although changes in geometries occur, these methods still refer to the methods that grow bulk single crystals. Bakr's group introduced a cavitation-triggered asymmetrical crystallization (CTAC) strategy, in which a very short ultrasonic pulse (≈1 s) was applied in the solution to reach a low supersaturation level with antisolvent vapor diffusion and a thin film of several micrometer thickness grew on the surface of the substrates within hours. The picture of a thin single crystal and a schematic illustration of such a method are shown in Fig. 5a. In this method, ultrasound can incite nucleation without the help of seed crystals under the condition of low supersaturation, but in a deep supersaturation stage, numerous tiny crystals would form. The rate and time of the ultrasonic pulse can be further regulated to control the thickness of the thin single crystals.

With the aim to develop perovskite single crystals with a much thinner thickness, Liu's group synthesized thickness-controlled perovskite single crystal wafers using a dynamic flow microreactor (DFM) system. They put two thin glass slides in parallel with two spacers into a container with a predefined separation to grow single crystal wafers within the slit channel. Based on the ITC method, a constant peristaltic pump of GBL through the glass slides was used to promote the growth of crystal wafers with a fresh solution. Several hundred-of-micrometer-thick wafers were grown by this method and the thicknesses are shown in Fig. 5b and c. Su's group further optimized the growth strategy and grew a 120 cm2-sized MAPbBr3 single crystal film on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass using a space-limited ITC (SLITC) method. A size- and thickness-controlled thin single crystal was realized by limiting the lateral growth of the single crystal with a narrow space. The operation and the 0.4 mm-thin single crystal film are shown in Fig. 5d.
Meanwhile, Wan and co-workers reported a space-confined solution-processed method to grow submillimeter-sized MAPbBr3 single-crystalline thin films (SCTFs) with adjustable thickness from nanometers to micrometers, as shown in Fig. 5e. Benefitting from the capillary pressure, the perovskite precursor solution filled the whole space between two clean flat substrates, which were clipped together and dipped in the solution. They also applied the top-seeded solution-growth (TSSG) method to the thin film growing process by heating the bottom saturated precursor solution, and thus, the cooler condition at the top of the substrates promoted the crystallization of perovskites and the temperature gradient supplied materials for continuous growth owing to their convection from bottom to top. The characteristic optical colors of MAPbBr3 SCTFs with different thicknesses were attributed to the effect of thin-film interference, which is related to the SCTF thickness and light wavelength.
Recently, more promising approaches have been employed to grow thin single crystals with large scale and high quality. A one-step printing geometrically-confined lateral crystal growth (GC-LCG) method was introduced by Sung's group to obtain a large-scaled single crystal film. They wrapped a cylindrical metal roller with a flexible poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) mold and then they rolled it on a preheated SiO2 substrate (180 °C) with an ink supplier filled with the MAPbI3 precursor solution. The ink solution evaporated instantly at the open end of the substrate and crystallization proceeded. The operation steps are shown in Fig. 5f. Alternatively, millimeter-sized single crystal films were synthesized by Song's group by a facile seed inkjet printing approach, which is shown in Fig. 5g. They injected the perovskite precursor solution onto a fluorosilane-functionalized silicon wafer, and then ordered perovskite seeds formed on the substrate with the evaporation of the droplets. They then covered the substrate with a saturated perovskite solution and the single crystal films grew as the solvent dried at room temperature. Seeds were used to inhibit the random nucleation and trigger the growth of single crystal films.
As discussed above, some optimized space-limited approaches, as shown in Table 2, have been introduced and developed to synthesize OIHP thin single crystals in recent years. Especially, size- and thickness-controlled thin single crystals have also been widely used in various optoelectronic devices. With the aim to grow large-scaled and thickness-controlled thin single crystals with longer carrier diffusion lengths, fewer defects, and higher efficiency, more promising strategies will be rewarding in the future.

Understanding the basic properties of a functional material, such as the structural features, as well as the optical and electrical properties, is a primary step before designing and developing suitable device applications. As for the hybrid perovskite single crystals, it would also be necessary to determine their basic characteristics, with the aim to optimize the device performance. Herein, we will provide the developments in physical property investigations for hybrid perovskite single crystals.


As shown in Fig. 1, the hybrid perovskite single crystals have the typical perovskite structure, of which the Pb2+ and halide ions form a 3D octahedral structure that is arranged by sharing the octahedral corners, with the MA+ ions filling the interstitial space between the units. The relative sizes of the ions are found to affect the formability of the perovskite structure. Two structural factors, namely, the tolerance factor (t.f.) and the octahedral factor (o.f.), which are calculated from the ionic radii of the ions, have been empirically used to gauge the stability of a perovskite structure. The reports showed that a stable perovskite structure of halide-based perovskite compounds can form where 0.81 < t.f. < 1.1 and 0.44 < o.f. < 0.90.

Several approaches have been used to characterize the structural properties of hybrid perovskite single crystals, as shown in Table 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the most widely used method to characterize the structure of OIHP single crystals. Bakr's group performed XRD measurements on MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals and compared the powder XRD patterns with the calculated XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 6a. The purity phase can be clearly found owing to the matching of the experimental powder XRD diffraction intensity with the calculated powder XRD pattern.
Measurement method
Function
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Regular arrays of atoms scatter X-rays, producing a regular array of spherical waves, which is determined by Bragg's law: 2dsinθ = nλ. Here d is the spacing between diffracting planes, θ is the incident angle, n is any integer, and λ is the wavelength of the beam.
Raman spectroscopy
The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations and phonons, resulting in the shift of laser photon energy, which can give information about the vibrational modes in the system.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
The interaction between electrons and a sample forms images of the sample's atomic structure, which is magnified and focused onto an imaging device.
Apart from the XRD measurements, Raman spectroscopy is another effective way to investigate the structural characteristics of perovskite single crystals. Due to the atomic mass difference, the phonon modes associated with inorganic atoms are located below 200 cm−1 and modes associated with organic atoms are observed at above 200 cm−1. Liu's group obtained a cubic CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal and acquired the Raman spectra using a 532 nm diode laser with the range of 50–500 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 6b. The shoulder peaks at 55 and 71 cm−1 represent Pb–I bending, the peak at 94 cm−1 stands for Pb–I stretching, and the peaks at 108, 138, 162, and 208 cm−1 are assigned to the vibration of the CH3NH3 cations. The relative peaks for tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals are at 71, 94, 108, 135 and 145 cm−1. As the 532 nm laser can excite fluorescence and thus reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and can also cause the degradation of the perovskite into PbX2, so the Raman spectra of the MA+ have been in the focus. Jeong's group used a 633 nm laser as the excitation source for Raman scattering measurements and a 405 nm laser as the excitation source for laser irradiation, which were performed at 24 °C in the dark with 42% humidity. The Raman scattering analysis result showed a C–N stretching vibration mode around 980 cm−1 and an NH3 symmetric bending mode around 1500 cm−1. As shown in Fig. 6c, the Raman spectra of pure phase perovskite single crystals were almost unchanged, but the spectra of pseudo-cubic phase perovskite single crystals gradually disappeared as the laser irradiated the sample and reoccurred under dark conditions after a period of time. In Fig. 6d, they found that after 20 min of laser irradiation, the laser-excited PL overwhelmed the Raman signals, resulting in the disappearance of Raman scattering signals.
Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements can provide a more intuitive picture of the fundamental structural characteristics of materials. Han's group overcame the difficulties for TEM characterizations of OIHP single crystals arising from their electron beam-sensitive property and successfully acquired a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image using the contrast transfer function (CTF) corrected method. As shown in Fig. 6e–g, different orientations of the off-centered CH3NH3 cations in MAPbBr3 crystals were found in their images, which indicated the normal and parallel projection directions of the CH3NH3 cations, which led to in-plane and out-of-plane electric dipoles.

There are two normal ways to study the optical properties of OIHP single crystals: steady-state absorption measurements and PL measurements. Bakr's group characterized the steady-state absorption and PL properties for MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals, as shown in Fig. 7a and b. Sharp band edges were observed in the absorption plots and the band gap values were determined to be 2.18 eV for MAPbBr3 crystals and 1.51 eV for MAPbI3 crystals. The PL intensity peaks are located at 574 nm for MAPbBr3 and 820 nm for MAPbI3. While for the MAPbCl3 single crystal, as shown in Fig. 7c, absorption and PL spectra measurement results revealed an absorption edge at 435 nm and determined the optical band gap to be 2.88 eV (inset). As shown in Fig. 7a–c, the optical absorption of a perovskite crystal exhibited a clear-cut sharp band edge with negligible excitonic signature compared with that of thin film polycrystalline perovskite materials. Therefore, this indicated that the single crystals are predominantly free from grain boundaries and have relatively low structural defects and trap densities. Moreover, the PL properties of perovskite single crystal materials range from the visible region to the near-IR region with a sharp, narrower band edge. The red-shifted PL peaks and narrower band gap of perovskite single crystals than their thin film counterparts indicate a significantly lower trap density, due to the tighter higher dimensional structurally coherent units in single crystals.

In addition to the above-mentioned outstanding optical properties of hybrid perovskite single crystals, the initial reports also indicated that the particular optical features of hybrid perovskite single crystals with the absorption edges located more than 0.1 eV lower in energy than their polycrystalline film counterparts. However, other groups also reported identical light emission and absorption properties of hybrid perovskite single crystals as their thin films. More recently, there have been more broad publications on such an apparent disparity in optical properties (i.e., absorption and photoluminescence) between perovskite single crystals and thin films, which can be attributed to the incorrect measurements as a result of reabsorption effects. Snaith's group performed a detailed investigation of the optical properties of MAPbBr3 single crystals as compared with those of the polycrystalline thin films by employing light transmission spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and spatially resolved and time-resolved PL spectroscopy. They showed that the optical properties of the perovskite single crystals were almost identical to the optical properties of polycrystalline thin films, and their observations indicated that the polycrystalline perovskite thin films were much closer to possessing ‘single-crystal-like’ optoelectronic properties than previously thought, and also highlighted the discrepancies in the estimation of trap densities from the electronic and optical methods (Fig. 7d).
For further development of hybrid perovskite single crystal optoelectronic applications with improved device performance and stability, much deeper investigations, and a more thorough understanding of the intrinsic photophysical properties are required. Fang and co-workers systematically measured the temperature- and power-dependent PL spectra and time-resolved spectra of MAPbI3 single crystals. Then, a contour map of the PL spectra was obtained at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 7e, which showed a continuous red shift from room temperature to 160 K, and a sudden inversion of the PL trend at the phase transfer temperature of 163–164 K, as well as the appearance of a new band as a shoulder at approximately 850 nm at around 100 K. This indicated an agreement of PL with a band-edge transition, which has a similar temperature-dependent shift to the absorption spectra above the transition temperature. To further observe the PL below 100 K, they investigated the PL spectra by varying the laser power density. Three different emission peaks appeared below the phase transition temperature, with Peak I attributed to a free-exciton (FE) transition and low energy Peak II and Peak III attributed to bound excitons (BE). Furthermore, they also employed time-resolved spectroscopy to measure the PL emission at different temperatures (Fig. 7f), which demonstrated a bi-exponential decay with a 6 ns fast component and an 83 ns slower component. This indicated a bimolecular recombination of free carriers and electron and hole trapping. The explanation involves a singlet to triplet splitting (80 meV) for the splitting in energy of peak I from peaks II and III, and the BE with a saturation phenomenon at high pump intensity and a triplet-state nature contributes to the long lifetime.
From then on, more detailed experimental investigations combined with theoretical calculations were focused on the optical features of hybrid perovskite single crystals, especially the excitation dynamics and the role of excitons. Generally, the excitons can be electrons and holes, or coulombically bound electron–hole states, and the band-edge electronic excitations mainly affect the properties of light emission, charge transport, and nonlinear optics for the semiconductors. The light absorption of excitons can lead to the step-like absorption onset in MAPbI3 transforming into a line-shape resonance in perovskites with a larger energy gap, and the exciton oscillator strength and binding energy increase with the tighter bound electron–hole states and the decrease of electron polarizability, which result from the increase of the semiconductor energy gap. Because the emission spectra of hybrid perovskites reach their peak at the energy of the exciton, which is almost irrelevant to band-to-band transitions, and also the faster radiative decay rate of excitons compensates for their lower population than free carriers, most of the luminescence is thus mainly attributed to the recombination of excitons. As the induced mobile charges can screen the excitons, Cook's group used a multi-THz measurement method to excite the MAPbI3 single crystal and acquired a differential reflectance amplitude data with higher carrier densities at a fluence of 810 μJ cm−2, as shown in Fig. 7g. Below the main reflection peak of free charges at 20 meV, the presence of a transient low energy peak of exciton at 12 meV proved the existence of exciton. And the decay of 12 meV peak concomitant with the 1 ps rise time of free charge density represents the dynamics of exciton dissociation, as shown in Fig. 7h. Further experimental and theoretical research and an in-depth understanding of the optical properties and the excitonic dynamics would assist in the preparation of high-quality perovskite single crystals with various forms and develop high-performance device applications.

Regarding the semiconductor materials, the basic electrical properties, such as carrier mobility and carrier lifetime, as well as carrier diffusion length and trap density, are the essential parameters, which are positively related to the performance of relevant optoelectronic devices and are summarized in Table 4. As for the hybrid perovskite single crystals, in addition to the remarkable optical properties, their promising electrical properties have caught the attention from scientists in recent years. Particularly, charge mobility is positively related to the charge extraction and transportation. Therefore, obtaining a larger carrier mobility is important to understand the intrinsic properties of perovskite single crystals and to enhance the performance of the relevant optoelectronic devices. In general, there are five common methods that can be used to measure the carrier mobility of electrons and holes in OIHP single crystals, which include the space charge limited current (SCLC), time-of-flight (TOF), Hall effect measurement, THz pulse measurement and field-effect transistor (FET) measurement (we will discuss these in detail in the Application section) methods. Among these methods, the SCLC method is widely employed to determine the carrier mobility of perovskite single crystals. Upon applying the SCLC method for the measured I–V curves under an applied bias by sandwiching a single crystal of perovskite between two electrodes with outer contacts, one can determine the carrier mobility and trap density. The J–V curve can be divided into three parts: the first region, where an Ohmic contact exists, hence the conductivity of the sample can be estimated; the second region is the trap-filling region, which is increased sharply at VTFL; and the third region, known as the child region. According to the relation between VTFL and the trap density (ntrap) , where VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant, L is the thickness of the crystal, and e is the electron charge, the trap density can be calculated. Moreover, the hole mobility is determined by fitting the J–V curve with Mott–Gurney's law: , where J is the current density and V is the applied voltage. Liu's group designed a hole-only device, which was made from a MAPbI3 single crystal with gold electrodes on both sides, and tested its dark current–voltage behavior, as shown in Fig. 8a. A large hole mobility of 67.27 cm2 V−1 s−1 was estimated. The SCLC method was also applied on MAPbBr3 single crystals, with a ntrap of 5.8 × 109 cm−3 and a mobility of 38 cm2 V−1 s−1, as shown in Fig. 8b. The current–voltage response of a MAPbCl3 single crystal was measured by Bakr's group, as shown in Fig. 8c, with an ntrap of ∼3.1 × 1010 cm−3 and a mobility of (42 ± 9) cm2 V−1 s−1.

Another method to measure the carrier mobility of OIHP single crystals is the TOF method. Bakr's group used this method to obtain the carrier mobility, by measuring the transient current after photoexcitation in a bilogarithmic plot, as shown in Fig. 8d. The transient current under different driving voltages provides the transit time τt, which is defined by the kink in each trace and is linearly fitted in Fig. 8e. The mobility μ, which is equal to μp ≈ μn and calculated to be 115 cm2 V−1 s−1, where μp and μn are the hole and electron mobility, respectively, can be defined by the equation , where d is the sample thickness and V is the applied voltage. In Fig. 8f, the same method was applied by Huang's group and the electron mobility was verified to be 24.0 ± 6.8 cm2 V−1 s−1, as shown in Fig. 8g.
Apart from the above two methods, the Hall effect measurement is another widely used technique to investigate the carrier transport properties in materials. The technique was first introduced to check the carrier mobility by Osman's group. From their work, the complementary Hall effect measurements at room temperature confirmed an estimated mobility in the range from 20 to 60 cm2 V−1 s−1. They also mentioned that the slightly lower Hall effect mobilities may be ascribed to surface effects that are negligible for time-of-flight, which constitutes a bulk probe. Meanwhile, Jinsong Huang's group used gallium as the electrodes to apply the Hall effect measurement, and they showed that the crystals were slightly p-doped with a low free hole concentration and the majority carrier was determined to be holes. Moreover, the Hall effect hole mobility was as high as 105 ± 35 cm2 V−1 s−1, which agreed with the SCLC results, and indicated that the band-tail states in the perovskite single crystals were negligible. Thereafter, Podzorov's group increased the conductivity of CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystals by sputtering Ti on the flat-faceted single crystal to form Hall bar electrodes. As shown in Fig. 8h, after poling single crystals to be a lower-resistance state at room temperature, they carried out the Hall effect measurements in the 4-probe contact geometry at different voltages with the magnetic field swept at a rate 15 G s−1 between −0.5 and +0.5 T. The Hall mobility was calculated to be 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 (at 300 K) and showed hardly any relation to the bias, following the equation: , where D is the distance between the voltage probes (V− and V+), W is the sample's width, V4p is the longitudinal voltage drop between the voltage probes. The relationship between temperature and Hall-effect mobility is shown in Fig. 8i and j, which demonstrated the increase of mobility when the measurement temperature passed below the cubic-tetragonal phase transition.
Although the above measurement approaches have been widely used in various materials systems and in perovskite single crystals, the obtained measurement results from different research groups are usually different. Sargent and co-workers demonstrated that one of the challenges that may explain these order-of-magnitude discrepancies is that the Hall effect, TOF, and SCLC methods all probe the mobilities near the respective Fermi levels during the experiment, and the (nonequilibrium, high-injection-level) Fermi level is widely different in each experiment. In this regard, they developed a contactless method to measure the carrier mobility and further extract the diffusion lengths of a perovskite single crystal directly and straightforwardly. Such a technique is based on a 3D diffusion-quenching method, which also has the advantage of avoiding both the effects of contact resistance and those of a high electric field. To accurately evaluate the charge carrier transport features within the OIHP single crystal, more suitable methods should be further developed and studied.
Additionally, THz pulse measurement is another method to estimate the mobility of perovskite single crystals. David and co-workers used a two-colour laser plasma in dry air to generate multi-THz pulses and excited the large single crystal CH3NH3PbI3 samples and detected the electric field by an air-biased coherent detection scheme with 1–30 THz (4–125 meV) ultra-bandwidth after normal incidence reflection off the crystal facet, as shown in Fig. 8k and l. Such spectra measurements indicate the ultrafast dynamics and efficiencies of free charge creation and remarkably high charge carrier mobility as high as 500–800 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Carrier lifetime (τ) is an important parameter that should be considered when designing an optoelectronic device. Upon excitation by photons, the active materials will be in an excited state. After that, the photo-induced holes and electrons will recombine back to the ground state. Usually, if this recombination process, that is, the carrier lifetime of electrons and holes, is sufficiently long, a high performance of the relevant device will be expected. Moreover, the carrier lifetime of the semiconductors strongly depends on the nature, dimension, and purity of the materials. So far, determined by Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) statistics, τ can be obtained from the PL decay, transient absorption, as well as the transient photovoltage decay and impedance methods. Among these methods, the PL decay approach has been widely applied. According to the PL spectra measurement result from Bakr's group, as shown in Fig. 8m and n, the superposition of fast and slow components of carrier dynamics yield τ ≈ 41 and 357 ns for MAPbBr3, and τ ≈ 22 and 1032 ns for MAPbI3. Following a tri-exponential fitting function: F(t) = ∑aie−t/τi, i = 1, 2, 3, where ai is the prefactor and τi is the time constant. The two different parts were assigned to be a surface component (fast) and a bulk component (slow), which indicates that the carrier lifetime propagates deep in the materials, and the fast decay component may result from the carrier recombination and carrier diffusion owing to the high carrier mobility of single crystals; while the slow component may be related to the bulk recombination and indicate the high quality of single crystals. Transient absorption (TA) also suggests the recombination property of excitons and is used to determine the carrier lifetime. Bakr's group synthesized MAPbCl3 single crystals and analyzed their carrier lifetime of using TA spectra after a biexponential fit with fast (τ ∼ 83 ns) and slow (τ ∼ 662 ns) components, as shown in Fig. 8o. The carrier diffusion length LD can be further estimated based on the equation: , where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the sample temperature. From the above-examined values of μ and τ, LD was calculated to be ∼17 μm in MAPbBr3 and ∼8 μm in MAPbI3. Huang's group also tested the carrier diffusion length under 1 sun, which was calculated to be 175 ± 25 μm. Furthermore, from the so-called contactless method developed by Sargent et al., the obtained diffusion length in metal-halide perovskites was approximately 2.6 μm ± 0.1 μm.
Luther and Beard's group investigated the surface recombination of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite single crystals without post treatment on the surface using broadband transient reflectance (TR) spectroscopy. They operated the TR measurements under various pump intensities and normalized the kinetic traces, finding that the TR kinetics is independent of excitation density under a given excitation energy and the decay of TR kinetics is not because of the first-order bulk recombination due to their shorter time scale than ∼31 ns, indicating that the reasons for TR kinetics decay are surface recombination and the carrier diffusion from the surface into the bulk. Furthermore, by changing the excitation energies, they found a linear relationship between the relative reflectance change (ΔR(ℏω)/R) and the photoexcited carrier density N, as shown in the normalized Fig. 8p, following the equation
where
t means the delay time, x represents the distance from the surface, α is the absorption coefficient, D is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient, S means the surface recombination velocity, and w(z) = exp(z2)[1 − erf(z)]. After a non-linear global fitting routine with the detecting region being approximated at the surface N(t,0) and α being determined from the ellipsometry, the best-fit parameters are S = 3.4 ± 0.1 × 103 cm s−1 and D = 0.27 ± 0.01 cm2 s−1, which are ∼2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that in many solar cell semiconductors. The surface recombination is mainly because of the surface-defect-caused mid-gap states for single crystal semiconductors and the grain boundaries for polycrystalline thin films, which can determine the effective carrier lifetime. They also compared the effective lifetime τeff as a function of grain size and S, as shown in Fig. 8q, following the equation , where τb is the bulk carrier lifetime and d represents the planar grain size. To make τeff approach τb when d < 5 μm, ultra-low S is required, which means the surface passivation is necessary when the grain size is smaller than 5 μm. When the grain size is larger than 30 μm, the influence of the surface recombination is eliminated.


The dramatic increase of performance in solar cells based on hybrid perovskite films has aroused the interest of scientists all over the world, which has also promoted the remarkable boom of other optoelectronic applications based on perovskite polycrystalline films. Encouragingly, as shown in the above section, hybrid perovskite single crystals have much more promising physical properties as compared with the polycrystalline candidates, thus the single crystals have evoked new research interest in the optoelectronics and sensing communities. In the following part, we will discuss the up-to-date research progress of perovskite single crystals in the relevant fields, as shown in Fig. 9.


The widely studied hybrid perovskite solar cells with high device performance are usually based on polycrystalline films; however, the current studies have also focused on the developments and optimization of hybrid perovskite single crystal solar cells, owing to the significant advantages over the polycrystalline devices.

Huang's group first fabricated photovoltaic devices based on MAPbI3 bulk single crystals by depositing 25 nm gold (Au) electrodes on one side of the crystal's surface as anodes and bringing gallium (Ga) in contact with the opposite surface as cathodes, as shown in Fig. 10a. They peeled off a thickness of 100 to 200 μm single crystals to prepare >3 mm- or >200 μm-thick devices and compared the MAPbI3 single crystal (MSC) devices with the MAPbI3 polycrystalline (MPC) devices with respect to the normalized external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 10b). A red-shift of 50 nm of the EQE cutoff to 850 nm showed that the MSCs increased the upper limit of short-circuit current density (JSC) compared with the MPC solar cells from 27.5 mA cm−2 to 33.0 mA cm−2. The band gap of MSCs was 1.61 eV and the EQE of a 3 mm MSC solar cell ranged from 12.6% to 15.8% for the wavelength range from 520 nm to 810 nm. As compared with the perovskite polycrystalline solar cells, the photovoltaic devices based on bulk single crystals showed much lower efficiency, which was attributed to the fact that photo-generated carriers could not be fully collected in a thick active layer. Much thinner MAPbBr3 monocrystalline films grown on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass were applied into solar cell devices by Bakr's group by using gold electrodes, as shown in Fig. 10c. The illuminated J–V curves of the devices are presented in Fig. 10d, and the devices showed the best cell performance with a fill factor (FF) of 0.58, a JSC of ≈7.42 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ≈1.24 V, and a PCE of 5.37%.
With the aim to enhance the performance of solar cells based on perovskite single crystals, Huang's group further grew MAPbI3 single crystal layers with different thicknesses on ITO substrates covered with a hole transport layer (HTL) and fabricated single crystal solar cells with the structure of ITO/poly triaryl amine (PTAA)/MAPbI3/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/copper (Cu) by depositing electron transport layers (ETLs) and metal electrodes on the top of the single crystals, as shown in Fig. 10e. The best device had a JSC of 20.5 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.06 V, a FF of 74.1%, as well as a PCE of 16.1%. As shown in Fig. 10f, the PCE was increased to 17.8% with a JSC of 21.0 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.08 V, and a FF of 78.6%. The PCE was calculated by the steady-state photocurrent output at the maximum power point, as shown in Fig. 10g. They also measured the shell lifetime of the single crystal solar cell in air, which remained nearly unchanged after storage in the dark for 30 days, which indicated better air stability than that of the polycrystalline thin-film solar cells.
In addition to the vertical structure solar cells, a new kind of lateral structure perovskite single crystal solar cell was synthesized by Huang's group, as shown in Fig. 10h. They observed the piezoelectric effect and ion migration behavior, which were generated by strain-generated grain-boundaries and could form a p–i–n structure, within the MAPbI3 single crystals. The lateral structure device showed a VOC of 0.82 V, the highest PCE of 5.36% at 170 K, and a PCE of 1.88% at room temperature.
More recently, a 20 μm MAPbI3 single crystal inverted p–i–n solar cell with PCE as high as 21.09% and a FF of up to 84.3% was fabricated by Bakr's group. The cross-sectional SEM image and energy band diagram of the ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3 single-crystal/C60/BCP/Cu architecture and photovoltaic performances are shown in Fig. 10i–k. They avoided a soluble solvent for the hybrid perovskite by spin-coating post-treatment and fabricated, stored, and tested their devices in a N2 environment to prevent interface hydration. To further realize the optimized performance of perovskite single crystal solar cells, more efforts will be made to enhance the sample quality and to design promising device structures.

Photodetectors (PDs) are typical optoelectronic devices that can convert incident light into electrical signals, and are critical for various industrial and scientific applications. Based on their absorption of different spectral regions, perovskite single crystal photodetectors can be divided into visible light PDs, UV light PDs, and infrared PDs. Furthermore, some special wavelengths may also be detected, such as in X-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopy (Fig. 11). In the following section, we will classify the photodetectors based on perovskite single crystals operating in different spectral regions.

To evaluate the performance of a photodetector, several parameters are important. Although certain applications require different features, the key figure-of-merit parameters in photodetectors are the responsivity (R), detectivity (D*), linear dynamic range (LDR), and response speed. Some of these parameters are discussed here: several key performance parameters are listed and are explained in Table 5 briefly.

Huang's group fabricated single crystal photodetectors based on MAPbI3 and mixed MAPbBr3−xClx perovskites that exhibited a high sensitivity capacity, which led to a narrow-band photoresponse with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 20 nm under a reverse bias (−1 V) of the device, as shown in Fig. 12a. EQE spectra of each kind of single crystal only showed a narrow peak near the absorption edge, which promised a detection application at a specific wavelength, where the background emission is suppressed. The peak specific detectivity (D*) shown in Fig. 12a was over 2 × 1010 Jones at 570 nm under a bias of −4 V. They also measured the current spectrum using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyzer, which showed a decreasing signal peak as the light intensity was decreased, as shown in Fig. 12a.

Thereafter, Huang and his co-workers further fabricated vertical structured p–i–n photodetectors based on OIHP thin single crystals with low noise and a large linear-dynamic-range. They grew MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 thin crystals directly on the nonwetting hole transport layer-coating substrates (PTAA) using a space-confined method, and then fabricated the vertical-structured p–i–n photodetectors, as shown in Fig. 12b. The J–V curve is shown in Fig. 12b, which indicated an almost constant current at the reverse bias close to 0 V and the self-powered characteristic of the photodetectors. The MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 photodetectors exhibited a low dark current of 2.0 × 10−9 and 1.8 × 10−7 A cm−2, respectively, at −0.3 V, which contributed to the low noise of the devices, and resulted in their ultrahigh sensitivity. Using a lock-in amplifier and a low noise preamplifier, they measured the noise current, which reached 1.4 and 1.8 fA Hz−1/2 at a frequency of 8 Hz for the devices based on MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3, respectively. The EQEs of the MAPbI3 devices were between 50% and 62%, which corresponded to a responsivity from 0.17 to 0.32 A W−1 in the wavelength range from 400 to 780 nm. In addition, the EQEs of the MAPbBr3 device were between 52% and 60%, which corresponded to a responsivity from 0.17 to 0.26 A W−1 in the wavelength range from 400 to 540 nm. The photocurrent responses of both the MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 devices were linear, and the large LDRs of the detectors were 256 dB and 222 dB. The response times of the two devices were 100 and 300 ns, respectively, and the 3 dB cutoff frequencies were calculated to be 4.4 and 1.5 MHz, respectively.
Sun's group introduced a planar-type photodetector on the (001) facet of a MAPbI3 single crystal with the highest R value of 953 A W−1 and EQE of 2.22 × 105% at an irradiance power density of 2.12 nW cm−2, which is shown in Fig. 12c. Under different illumination powers, the photoelectric behavior of this device was convertible, as shown in Fig. 12c. Wei's group used a two-step method to fabricate a self-powered photodetector based on a MAPbBr3 single crystal core–shell heterojunction. The device had a JSC of 0.1961 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.61 V, a FF of 41.3%, as well as a broad photoresponse ranging from 350 to 800 nm and a peak responsivity of up to 11.5 mA W−1 with an EQE of 3.17%. It also exhibited a stable On–Off switching with a rise time of 2.3 s and a fall time of 2.76 s after several cycles. Hu's group synthesized photodetectors based on a MAPbI3 single crystal nanowire and nanoplate by transferring them to SiO2/Si slides and depositing Au electrodes. The highest On/Off ratio approached 103 under a light illumination of 73.7 mW cm−2.
Although hybrid perovskite single crystal photodetectors have been shown to have better performance, as compared with their polycrystalline counterparts, macroscopic single crystals cannot be grown on a planar substrate, which restricts their potential for optoelectronic integration. To overcome these shortcomings, Bakr's group fabricated large-area planar-integrated SC films by directly growing perovskite (MAPbBr3) single crystals on top of ITO-patterned substrates, as shown in Fig. 12d. This integration of micrometer-sized bromine-based perovskite single crystals on a transparent ITO/glass substrate enabled a large gain from the perovskite single crystals, as shown in Fig. 12d. Using this single crystal film, a high-performance photodetector was prepared, which possessed a high gain (above 104 electrons per photon) and a high gain-bandwidth product (above 108 Hz) relative to other perovskite-based optical sensors. A large responsivity exceeding 4000 A W−1 was obtained, which corresponded to a gain above 104 electrons per photon.
Furthermore, the space-limited inverse temperature crystallization (SLITC) method has also been widely used to prepare the thin single crystals onto various substrates, to realize high-performance photodetectors. Liu's group used the SLITC method to fabricate a photodetection device based on a single crystal wafer, which has approximately 100 pairs of interdigitated Au wire electrodes, as shown in Fig. 12e. From the photocurrent response under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, as shown in Fig. 12e, the photocurrent increased to as high as 700 μA at a bias of 2 V. The photoresponse of their device, as shown in Fig. 12e, increased linearly as the radiance intensity decreased, and it was two orders of magnitude higher than that of its polycrystalline counterpart. Moreover, Chen-Yong Su's group sputtered a thin Au layer on a large-area MAPbBr3 thin single crystal to fabricate a narrowband photodetector, as shown in Fig. 12f. From the EQE spectra of the devices based on a thin single crystal with different thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 12f, a wide light response range was found from an onset wavelength of about 580 nm to the short wavelength region for a 0.1 mm MAPbBr3 perovskite crystal photodetector, and a decreased response below 530 nm and an obvious peak at 544 nm for a 0.2 mm film. Furthermore, superior performance photodetectors based on MAPbBr3 single crystal thin films (SCTFs) were reported by Ma's group. With a higher carrier collection efficiency and an almost 100% absorption of incident light, a SCTF with a thickness of 380 nm was used to fabricate a photodetector, as shown in Fig. 12g. The responsivity reached 1.6 × 107 A W−1 and the highest gain was as high as 5 × 107. The LDRs were 83 dB at a bias of −1.5 V and 50 dB at a bias of 0 V. The minimum number of photons for a response by the device was 200 in each pulse of incident light at 180 Hz under a bias of −1.5 V. The 3 dB bandwidth was 1400 Hz and the self-powered current had a rise time of 81 μs and a fall time of 890 μs.

Ultraviolet (UV) detection is a key technology in the fields of flame detection, remote security monitoring, environmental monitoring, and so forth. Researchers have endeavored to develop UV photodetectors based on hybrid perovskite single crystals considering their excellent absorption properties in the UV range. Perovskite MAPbCl3 has a suitable bandgap of approximately 3.11 eV, and its single crystals were applied to fabricate UV photodetectors with a high performance. Visible-blind UV-photodetectors based on MAPbCl3 single crystals were fabricated by Bakr's group, which were crystallized through the proper selection of a DMSO-DMF solution.Fig. 13a shows the device architecture: a semitransparent Pt layer of 20 nm served as the top electrode and a layer of 20 nm Ti/100 nm Au was deposited as the bottom electrode. The I–V curve of the device showed a dark current as low as 4.15 × 10−7 A at 15 V and a drastically high temporal photoresponse of 24 ms, as shown in Fig. 13b. Moreover, the photocurrent remained stable up to 8000 s under continuous 365-nm light illumination (1 W cm−2) at a bias of 15 V as shown in Fig. 13c, which indicated high photostability.

Visible-blind transparent UV photodetectors based on MAPbCl3 single crystals were also synthesized and optimized by Sargent and his co-workers. They grew planar-integrated crystal films directly onto the ITO-deposited glass substrate by the ITC method and then removed the pre-added toluene by heating the sample at 145 °C. The relevant UV detectors are shown in Fig. 13d, and the space between the ITO electrodes was 5 μm, which represented the least-resistance path between the contacts. As shown in Fig. 13e, the responsivity of the device was also tested under different light intensities (λ = 385 nm), and displayed a decrease as the incident power was increased, which arose from the electronic trap states at the perovskite–ITO interface and enabled the transition of the contact from rectifying in the dark to Ohmic under light illumination. The response time, which is determined by the lifetime of the electronic trap states at the semiconductor–metal interface, was tested as shown in Fig. 13f. After illumination, if the traps stay filled for a long time, the speed will be determined by the slower part of the fall time, and the fall time of the device based on the planar-integrated MAPbCl3 crystal films was determined to be 1 ms.

Near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) photodetectors have widespread uses in telecommunication, and thermal and biological imaging. An IR or NIR photoresponse is usually achieved in photodetection devices by using intrinsic semiconductors with a narrow bandgap and extrinsic semiconductors with a wide bandgap. Meredith's group synthesized a hybrid perovskite single crystal that overcame the large bandgap of crystals (>1 eV) and presented photodetectors with performance metrics appropriate for NIR detection at room temperature by using the trap-related linear sub-gap absorption. They also showed that the NIR responsivity can be enhanced by adopting a lateral photoresistor geometry, thus accessing a higher density of trap-states within the single crystal surfaces. A strong photoresponse in the NIR range was achieved in photodiodes based on CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals, when a continuous wave 808 nm laser with a low light intensity of ∼10 mW cm−2 was used to illuminate the crystal sides. Their photodiodes could also respond to a laser with a wavelength as long as 1064 nm, which was below the bandgap. Fig. 14a shows the device structure of the NIR detector based on hybrid perovskite single crystals, and Fig. 14b demonstrates the unchanged sub-gap photoresponse with trap state absorption of the device. The sub-bandgap absorption, which is close to the valence band, could also benefit from hole trap states. They evaporated interdigitated electrodes on MAPbBr3 single crystals, as shown in Fig. 14c, and measured their responsivities at different reverse bias voltages, which are shown in Fig. 14d. These broadband absorption photoresistors showed narrowband photoresponses in NIR by manipulating the IQE of the devices through charge collection narrowing (CCN).


In addition to the common light detections from UV to IR, hybrid perovskite single crystals have been employed for the detection of X-rays, which have important applications in various fields, such as medical diagnostics, clinical treatment, and the non-destructive testing of products. Actually, the initial applications of methylammonium lead perovskite films (thickness of 60 μm) in photoconductive and photovoltaic devices have already been shown to be able to detect the soft X-rays, because of their high-Z elements Pb, I, and Br. Additionally, a high sensitivity for the device based on sintered hybrid lead perovskite wafers was also determined from the slope of the current output versus X-ray dose. However, the polycrystalline films formed by spray coating in that work had a small μτ product, which was still much smaller than that of state-of-the-art X-ray detector materials such as some common inorganic semiconductors. The hybrid perovskite single crystals combine the advantages of high stopping power, low trap density, and high charge collection efficiency, which should enable high-sensitivity soft and hard X-ray detection. Huang's group fabricated a sensitive X-ray detector based on MAPbBr3 single crystals with the structure of Au/MAPbBr3 single crystal/C60/BCP/Ag or Au, as shown in Fig. 15a. As shown in Fig. 15b, the stopping energy of OIHPs is similar to that of CdTe, which is much stronger than that of silicon, and the devices attenuated almost all of the X-rays. The generated current density signal had a linear relationship with the X-ray dose rate, as shown in Fig. 15c. Through reducing the bulk defects and passivating surface traps, the authors showed that the single-crystal devices with a thickness of 2–3 mm showed a detection efficiency of 16.4% at a near zero bias under irradiation with continuum X-ray energy up to 50 keV. The lowest detectable X-ray dose rate was 0.5 μGyair s−1 with a sensitivity of 80 μC Gyair−1 cm−2, which is four times higher than the sensitivity achieved in α-Se-based X-ray detectors. This allows the radiation dose applied to a human body to be reduced for many medical and security check applications.

An X-ray detector based on a PIN diode array made of a thick MAPbBr3 single crystal was introduced by Chen's group. The PIN photodetector with the structure of Au/poly-TPD (N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine)/MAPbBr3 PSC/C60 doped PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)/Ag is shown in Fig. 15d, in which poly-TPD acted as a HTL and C60-doped PCBM acted as an ETL, and Au and Ag worked as the anode and cathode, respectively. Fig. 15e shows the schematic energy level diagram of the PIN device, in which photo-generated electrons and holes in the active layer were effectively separated and transported to their corresponding electrodes under an external electric field. As shown in Fig. 15f, the J–V curves showed an increasing saturated photocurrent under an increased voltage bias with the increase of the X-ray photon energy, and the highest sensitivity of 23.6 μC mGyair−1 cm−2 was achieved. The authors also employed the devices for practical applications. They measured a glass of water with a metal pole and a chicken claw with X-ray energies of 30 to 100 eV, low photon energy, and high photon energy separately, as shown in Fig. 15g and h. Water is a low Z material and thus is more sensitive to lower energy, while the metal pole is sensitive to higher X-ray energy but the contrast is not sufficiently high. According to the difficulty for X-ray to pass through bones, the contrast between the fibula and radius is enhanced under a lower energy X-ray. Moreover, because of the lack of soft tissue information in a high energy image, the width of the thumb is larger under a lower energy X-ray.

Similar to X-ray detectors, gamma-ray (γ-ray) detectors are also widely used in many fields, owing to their non-invasive detection of a condensed object. However, γ-ray detectors need to work in a weak radiation field pulse mode and perform event-by-event detection to sort out the intensity versus the energy of the radiation quanta. Large and balanced μ and τ are needed for high-energy detection. In 2015, Huang's group reported high-quality MAPbI3 single crystals that were applied to gamma-ray detection with an efficiency of 4% when operated in the gamma voltaic mode. Then, Kovalenko's group demonstrated MAPbI3 single crystals for gamma-ray detection, and a 59.6 keV Am energy spectrum was acquired. They fabricated a solid-state gamma-ray detector based on a rendered absorption spectrum of MAPbI3 single crystals over a broad range of photon energies by using the atomic absorption coefficients, which is shown in Fig. 16a. A fit of the bias dependence of the photocurrent with the Hecht model, as shown in Fig. 16b, indicated a high μτ product of ∼10−2 cm2 V−1. A mono-exponential decay of the activity was estimated by continuously recording the photocurrent, as shown in Fig. 16c, and it was equivalent to a half-life of 11C (20.3 min). The γ photon-to-charge carrier generation efficiency was calculated to be 2.5 × 104. Much lower activities could be sensed owing to the high dynamic range of sensitivity of the device, as shown in Fig. 16d, where a portable source of 137Cs with an activity of 2.2 MBq was detected.

Huang's group further reported a Cl− dopant compensation of the MAPbBr3 single crystal process to fabricate a low-cost γ-ray detector. CH3NH3PbBr2.94Cl0.06 single crystals were tested to be one of the most suitable dopants with a larger μτ product than other dopants, and they were equipped with a guard ring electrode to mitigate their leakage current, as shown in Fig. 16e. The 137Cs energy spectrum obtained by CH3NH3PbBr2.94Cl0.06 with a full-energy peak resolution of 6.50% is shown in Fig. 16f and is compared with the spectrum obtained by CZT and NaI(Tl) detectors, which have a resolution of the full-energy peaks of 2.27% and 7.51%, respectively. Fig. 16g shows the FWHM and an enlarged photopeak region of the 137Cs energy spectrum. After comparison, we can determine the capability of perovskite to obtain a better resolution than that of the typical NaI(TI) scintillator detector with a more economical method in industry.
A high-performance γ-ray spectrometer based on a MAPbI3 single crystal with asymmetric electrodes was designed by Kanatzidis and co-workers. Asymmetrical electrodes (Schottky-type) were applied to prohibit the hole injection from the anode or to reduce the leakage current, as shown in Fig. 16h. The low dark current was stable under a high electric field in the reversed bias range, as shown in Fig. 16i. From Fig. 16j and k, the best energy resolution for 241Am 59.5 keV γ-rays was ∼12%; while the best energy resolution achieved for 57Co 122 keV was 6.8%.

With the exceptional PL efficiency and high color purity, OIHP single crystals can also perform as high-performance light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Most of the existing OIHP LEDs employ a polycrystalline film with sizes of nanometers to micrometers, and coherent light emission is a challenge. In Yu's work, the LEDs consisted of an ITO anode, a MAPbBr3 single crystal microplatelet emissive layer, and an Au cathode. In their LEDs, a vertical p–i–n junction was formed from ion migration under an external electric field, and the junction could be frozen below a certain temperature owing to the immobilized ions. They charged the devices with different voltages at ambient temperature, and then cooled them to −193 °C and removed the bias to test the I–V characteristics, emission spectra, and representative optical images of the LED, which are given in Fig. 17a–c. The turn-on voltage was 1.8 V and the LED could last for at least 54 h with a luminance of ∼5000 cd m−2, which was tested and is shown in Fig. 17d.

The excellent properties, which included a small trap density, long electron–hole diffusion length, large carrier mobility, and long lifetime, make OIHP single crystals suitable for laser devices with low lasing thresholds and high qualities. Qihua Xiong's group grew typical CH3NH3PbI3 triangular nanoplatelets and optically pumped them by a femtosecond-pulsed laser, as shown in Fig. 18a. Several peaks centered at λ = 776.7, 779.2, 781.9, 784.3, and 786.8 nm appeared over the spontaneous emission band with a FWHM of ∼1.2 nm, when the pump fluence was increased to 40.6 μJ cm−2, as shown in Fig. 18b. Furthermore, the widths of two adjacent peaks were almost the same, which implied the same waveguiding origin of the mode. Time-resolved PL curves, shown in Fig. 18b (right inset), exhibited a long average lifetime of ∼2.6 ns and an ultrafast decay lifetime of ∼80 ps. Zhu's group grew a MAPbI3 single crystal nanowire by low-temperature solution processing and then demonstrated room-temperature lasing, which had a broad tenability covering the near-infrared to visible wavelength region. Optically pumped lasing was performed at room temperature in a dry N2 atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 18c. From Fig. 18d, a sharp peak appeared at 787 nm in the representative emission spectra and grew rapidly with increasing pump laser fluence (P). The nanowire emitted lasing uniformly below the lasing threshold PTh (∼595 nJ cm−2) but emitted mainly from the two end facets above PTh with a strong waveguiding effect and axial Fabry–Perot cavity modes. Single-crystal nanowires of MAPbBryI3−y and MAPbClxBr3−x were also synthesized and showed a tunable lasing emission wavelength at room temperature.
Additionally, CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal square microdisks were synthesized into a 557 nm single-mode laser based on a built-in whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonator by Fu's group. They collected μ-PL spectra using a charge-coupled device (CCD) from the second harmonic (λ = 400 nm, pulse width 150 fs), as shown in Fig. 18e. From the μ-PL spectra of a microdisk with a side-length of 2.0 μm, as shown in Fig. 18f, under different excitation intensities, broad spontaneous emission (SE) was observed to center at 545 nm upon an excitation density of 2.4 μJ cm−2 with a FWHM of 23 nm. A sharp peak gradually appeared around 557.5 nm with a FWHM of 1.1 nm, as the excitation density was increased to 5.4 μJ cm−2, which indicated the laser emission in this case. In Fig. 18h, a lasing threshold at Pth = 3.6 μJ cm−2 was observed, and a sublinear regime was observed below the threshold. Furthermore, the output PL intensity increased superlinearly above the threshold, which suggested a particular optical cavity in the stimulated process of PL.
Uniform-sized CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal microplates were also created by Jiang et al. by using a “liquid knife” and were made into lasers. The beam of a 400 nm pulsed laser was used as a pump source to excite single crystal microplates, as shown in Fig. 18i, and a spontaneous emission peak centered at 550 nm with a FWHM of 20 nm was observed, as shown in Fig. 18j. According to finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, the transverse magnetic (TM) mode quality factor (Qcal) was higher than that of the transverse electric (TE) mode, which allowed for the total internal reflection and well-defined WGM resonance.

The influence of the environment to perovskite optoelectronic properties has been investigated in recent years. Loi and co-workers modulated the physisorption of O2 and H2O molecules to investigate the surface recombination velocity (SRV) of MAPbBr3 single crystals. The increased surface recombination in a vacuum led to a lower fraction of the photogenerated carriers to diffuse toward the interior of the crystal, which resulted in a lower PL intensity in a vacuum, and the gas molecules were physisorbed rather than chemisorbed on the crystal surface. Devices under vacuum also had a shorter PL lifetime. They performed optical spectroscopy in atmospheres of moist air, dry N2, He, CO2, a mixture of O2 (20%) and He (80%), moist N2, moist O2, and a vacuum separately to further determine the effect of the gas molecules on the crystal surface, as shown in Fig. 19a and b. Exposure of the crystal to dry N2, CO2, or Ar had no influence on the PL intensity, while the PL intensity increased rapidly in the presence of air, dry O2, and moist N2, which suggested the role of O2 and H2O in PL enhancement. They also measured the I–V curve of a MAPbBr3 single crystal device in a vacuum and air to investigate the interaction between ambient gas molecules and the defect sites, as shown in Fig. 19c and d. A larger effect on the current was observed that increased from 10 μA in a vacuum to 24 μA in air. This increase was reversible when the device was re-measured in a vacuum, which indicated the important role of surface trap sites in air to determine the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbBr3 single crystal.


Liu's group synthesized one kind of imaging sensor based on MAPbBr3 single crystals through a low-temperature-gradient-crystallization approach, and the structure of the device is shown in Fig. 20a. Image sensing was realized by recognizing optical patterns generated by 525 nm illumination at a bias voltage of 2 V that were projected on the imaging assembly. Fig. 20b–d shows the projection imaging assembly, which used image assembly units with 729 pixels to measure and display the 525 nm light illumination that penetrated through patterned photomasks. Fig. 20e–g shows the corresponding outputs under a bias of 2 V, which were based on the photocurrent distribution of the full area of the sensor unit. The response speed was trise = 43 μs and tdecay = 36 μs, faster than the pattern recognition of the human eye (>40 ms) and that of the perovskite nanowire counterpart (trise = 20.47 ms and tdecay = 13.81 ms).

A perovskite single-crystal film introduced by Song's group was used in imaging sensors by further printing it on high-optical-quality quartz glass, and they also deposited a 120 nm-thick Au electrode array on it, as shown in Fig. 20h. The high uniform photoresponse of the device under illumination is revealed in Fig. 20i. The optical image in Fig. 20j was illuminated from the back of the device and the photocurrent intensity map in Fig. 20k demonstrated a clear image, which was very similar to the original image.

The field effect transistor (FET) is a fundamental component to realize modern digital integrated circuits, which is a key active device for the electronics industry. The FET is also often used as a platform to evaluate lateral charge transport and (opto-)electronic transport properties in isotropic materials and for the investigation of new emergent properties by electrostatically doping the material, which is otherwise not easily accessible. Halide hybrid perovskites have emerged as promising semiconductors with outstanding properties for optoelectronics. Despite such unprecedented progress, several riddles remain to be solved, which include the fundamental details of the charge transport mechanisms in halide perovskites. Additionally, recent discoveries have highlighted the important role of external stimuli, such as electromagnetic radiation and electric field, on the structural dynamics, which in turn strongly impact the disorder and charge transport in hybrid perovskites. The dynamic nature of the material also provides opportunities to understand and discover new physical phenomena that couple charge transport, structural dynamics, electric field, and light. The FET is an excellent platform for the elucidation of new physical properties and for the realization of novel perovskite electronic devices.

As mentioned above, OIHP single crystals possess excellent carrier transport properties, owing to the absence of grain boundaries, low trap density, and long carrier diffusion length, which make them good candidates to be planar-structured transistors. In this regard, bottom-gate, top-contact field-effect transistors (BGTC FETs) were fabricated by Aram Amassian's group by using MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) thin single crystals as an active layer. Au electrodes were deposited onto the thin perovskite crystals and an n-doped Si wafer with a SiO2 layer was used as a substrate, where the structure of the device is shown in Fig. 21a. As shown in Fig. 21b, the I–V current was measured at a drain voltage (VDS) of −30 V and gate voltage (VGS) sweeping from −40 V to 40 V at room temperature, which indicated the ambipolar transfer characteristics of OIHP single crystal FETs. From the output characteristics in Fig. 21c, the device exhibited an ambipolar transport property at low VGS and showed unipolar transport with linear-to-saturation I–V transistor characteristics at high VGS. Moreover, the perovskite thin single crystal device resistance multiplied by the channel width was estimated to be 80 kΩ cm, which indicated a small contact resistance for the excellent FET performance.
In addition, vertical-structured FET devices based on a MAPbI3 single crystal thin film with different orientations were fabricated by Qingfeng Yan's group. The structure of the device is shown in Fig. 21d, with a thick Au layer deposited on the thin film as a drain electrode, and a nickel mask plate on the other side with interdigital Au film electrodes, whose bridging-gap width was 30 μm, served as the source. The dielectric layer was made from thick tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5), which was deposited on the source. From the FET characteristics of the single crystal with the [100] orientation, as shown in Fig. 21e–h, IDS increased with the increase of VGS, which is a P-type enhancement, when VGS was negative, while an N-type enhancement was observed when VGS was positive. No obvious saturation characteristics in the output curves were observed, which arose from the weaker regulation of vertical structure transistors when compared with the planar structure transistors.

Hybrid perovskite single crystals have shown great potential in high-performance optoelectronic/electronic and sensing devices. However, several challenges and issues still remain in terms of the practical applications of these devices. They mainly include the following: (1) the effects of surface defects on the properties of perovskite single crystals need to be systematically studied; (2) the large-area fabrication and (3) the stability of the perovskite single crystal devices require further improvement; (4) the health and environmental concerns should be considered; (5) the magnetic effects of perovskite single crystals are still partly unclear; and (6) a comparison should be made with perovskite polycrystalline films.


The absence of grain boundaries makes single crystals acquire better optical and charge transport properties than their polycrystalline counterparts. However, the surface of single crystals usually possesses lots of chemical impurities, dangling bonds, surface dislocations, and under-coordinated atoms, and becomes disordered owing to hydration, which can decrease the carrier mobility and carrier diffusion length and promote the recombination of carriers near the surface. Additionally, the recombination at the surface is found to be more important than that at grain boundaries in polycrystalline films. Furthermore, the MA+ group on the surface plane is free to rotate out of plane, which leads to the relaxation of Br atoms and causes a different structure on the surface, which was reported by Qi's group by using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy with the support of density functional theory calculations. Thus, a further decrease of defects, especially the surface defects, is needed, with the aim of gaining high-quality hybrid perovskite single crystals. To realize high-performance electronic/optoelectronic and sensing devices based on OIHP single crystals with low-level surface defects, more research should be done on surface passivation. Furthermore, washing the surface of the single crystal after they are taken out of precursors can also help to reduce the surface defects.


OIHP single crystal films are more free of grain boundaries and exhibit better carrier properties than those of the polycrystalline candidates, so their large-area fabrication will ensure a promising future in industrial applications. However, embedding of volatile and vulnerable organic components in fragile inorganic frameworks makes them difficult to fabricate with a large area by deposition techniques or solution-based methods. Furthermore, even millimeter- or centimeter-thick single crystal films have been reported. The difficulty of slicing and fabricating electrodes on brittle films make it a challenge to fabricate devices based on themselves. Thin single crystals were grown directly on conductive substrates like FTO glass or indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, and tailored substrates, such as SiO2/Si, which can provide in situ growth for thin single crystals and be directly made into devices. Nevertheless, these large-area thin single crystals have rough surfaces, which contain a great number of surface defects, and thus the optoelectronic properties of such materials remain inferior to their bulk single-crystal counterparts. Further optimization of the synthesis method of large-area thin single crystals is needed for application to industrial production in the future.


The low stability of the current OIHP single crystal devices hinders their broad practical application. Several factors that affect the stability of these devices, for example, ion migration, can cause current–voltage hysteresis and photoinduced phase separation, and the interaction between single crystals and their surroundings lies in the degradation of perovskites by humidity and light. Therefore, to further enhance the stability of OIHP single crystal devices, optimized structures of these devices should be designed to control the migration of ions. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the environmental condition during synthesis and the preservation of single crystals and their devices. Meanwhile, the unstable grain boundaries of OIHP thin films are susceptible to moisture attack, compared with their microwires, which also means that the quality of single crystals with fewer defects is an important point to improve the stability of single crystal devices. Moreover, various compositions and interface engineering approaches are also being intensively investigated to solve this critical issue. In addition, encapsulation has been demonstrated to be a valid method to protect OIHP devices.

In addition to reducing the surface defects, surface passivation can be regarded as another strategy for the long-term stability of OIHP single crystals. As was reported by Huang's group, UV–O3 treatment on the top surface of MAPbBr3 single crystals for 20 min led to a stronger PL intensity and longer recombination lifetime and these improvements were retained in a vacuum environment. Loi's group introduced benzylamine to permanently passivate the surface of OIHP single crystals by forming a more stable two-dimensional (BA)2PbBr4 on the surface. However, the accumulated 2D perovskite layers detached from the crystal surface and led to the formation of randomly distributed square etching pits. Residues of the byproducts were found on the crystal surface, which influenced the morphology and obscured the properties of crystals. Thus, more studies are needed to find cheaper and better methods to passivate the surface of single crystals, without affecting their performance.

The synthesis and growth of OIHP single crystals adopt heavy metal ions, like lead (Pb) or tin (Sn), and organic functional groups, which can impact both the environment and human health. This critical issue needs to be overcome, with the aim to further commercialization. As for the common hybrid perovskite single crystal sample, MAPbI3, the Pb ion is toxic to both human health and the natural environment, while the organic solvents used during the production process of single crystals, such as DMF and DMSO, are also toxic and easily penetrate into the human body. To solve these problems, capsulation and recycling are needed in the use of lead materials and organic solvents. Furthermore, other alternative metals to lead, with a lower toxicity, are also being studied, such as bismuth and antimony, and thus, the optoelectronic properties of these Pb-free hybrid perovskite single crystals need to be explored further for optoelectronic device applications.


Hybrid perovskite materials have also been reported to exhibit a balanced carrier mobility and long carrier diffusion length. Furthermore, it has been predicted that MAPbX3 possesses strong spin–orbit coupling and Rashba-type splitting that originates from the heavy metal (Pb). These properties would also intuitively suggest promising applications in spintronics.

However, there has already been some pioneering work on exploring the magnetic field effects in hybrid perovskite thin films. These studies demonstrated magneto-photoluminescence and magneto-photocurrent effects in perovskites and indicated that both photocurrent and photoluminescence are spin-dependent processes. Moreover, photo-induced magnetism has been achieved using the circularly polarized picosecond pump–probe technique. However, in-depth investigations of spin-polarized transport in hybrid perovskite materials are still lacking and will be potentially rewarding. As mentioned above, the OIHP single crystals are free of grain boundaries and have low structural defects. Thus, better charge and spin transport properties are expected if the single crystals can be used as the active layer in spintronic devices. The OIHPs can be studied by magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR). The magnetic effects of single crystals have rarely been discussed but will provide more options for the applications of single crystals.

Hybrid perovskites arose in the form of polycrystal films, which have been developed for many years and have relative mature technologies for device fabrication. Devices based on single crystals are still in the early stage; however, they have high potential for various device applications with the excellent merits as mentioned above. Currently, solar cells made of MAPbI3:xNd3+ (0.5 mol%) thin films can exhibit a PCE of 21.15%, and solar cells made of FAPbI3 with additional iodide ions in dripping solution possess a certified PCE of 22.1%, and the highest PCE for solar cells based on hybrid perovskite polycrystalline films so far is about 25.2%. In comparison, the highest PCE for hybrid perovskite single crystalline solar cells is about 21.09% to date. Thus, the perovskite single-crystal solar cells can further be optimized to acquire higher PCE through improving the crystal quality or designing novel device structures. Encouragingly, single crystals also showed leading performance on some other devices. Currently, Liang's group compared the device performances of MAPbI3 single-crystal photodetectors and their polycrystalline-film counterparts, which showed a much higher R of 953 A W−1 and EQE of 2.22 × 105% than those of polycrystalline counterparts with an R of 2.55 A W−1 and EQE values of 5.95 × 102%. Furthermore, Huang's group introduced a sensitive OIHP single-crystal X-ray detector with a sensitivity as high as 80 μC Gyair−1 cm−2, and Kovalenko's group introduced high-performance single-crystal gamma ray detectors. However, few studies reported perovskite polycrystalline thin films in X-ray or gamma ray detection, except for Matt's group who introduced millimeter-thick OIHP wafers with a conversion efficiency of 2527 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 under 70 kVp X-ray exposure. Moreover, it should be mentioned that perovskite single crystal samples also demonstrated much more excellent stabilities, which are also the important reason for the fast development of single crystals and their relevant optoelectronic devices. Therefore, perovskite single crystals still have a room for further improvement, despite being developed in recent years; hybrid perovskite single-crystal devices can still be optimized by referring to the development of polycrystalline devices and taking advantage of single crystalline specialty.


Inspired by the unprecedented optical and electronic properties of hybrid perovskite materials combined with the advantages of cost-effectiveness and ease of processing, hybrid perovskite optoelectronic devices have progressed tremendously over the past few years. More recently, methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite single crystals, having different dimensional forms: bulk, thin film, nanoplate, and so on, have been widely explored as functional layers for optoelectronic and sensing devices owing to their unique structures and excellent physical properties. Although these types of devices are still in the early stages of development, strong potential for a variety of technological and commercial applications clearly remains, thanks to the combined advantages of processing versatility and promising charge carrier transport with extraordinary optoelectronic properties. Here, we have presented a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in hybrid perovskite single crystals with respect to the background knowledge on the crystal structure, optoelectronic properties, and charge transport dynamics of crystals, and their applications in the area of optoelectronic and sensing devices, and a fundamental understanding of the device performance. The recent progress in the synthesis and processing of single crystals was reviewed and divided, based on two different dimensional forms of the bulk and thin crystals. We summarized and compared the bulk single crystal growth methods, including the solution temperature-lowering (STL) method, inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method, and temperature-independent anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method. In addition, some other modified and optimized approaches to synthesize thin single crystals are summarized for the first time. The detailed discussion is focused on charge-carrier transport characteristics, operation mechanisms, and the challenges of perovskite single crystals, with the aim of providing a critical understanding for the current development and further advance in materials design and device engineering in a variety of optoelectronic/electronic and sensing technologies. More particularly, the recent significant progress of photodetectors based on single crystals is reviewed and subdivided based on the different working wavelength ranges covering from the gamma to ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions.

In conclusion, the research progress achieved to date in the area of optoelectronic/electronic and sensing devices based on perovskite single crystals, with an emphasis placed on the challenges faced by the research community, has been summarized and discussed systematically, and finally the perspective on the opportunities offered by this emerging family to photoactive materials in practical and commercial technologies is also proposed. Nevertheless, hybrid perovskite single crystals and relevant applications are just emerging, and deeper insights into basic physical properties, growth approaches, and underlying working principles are required. Further exploration of high-quality perovskite single crystals, combined with an improved understanding of the optoelectronic properties of devices, indicates a promising future for wide applications with markedly enhanced device performance.
