We report a melamine formaldehyde resin (MF) interlayer which is formed via the heat-induced polymerization of hexakis(methoxymethyl)melamine on the surface of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. The MF interlayer effectively reduces the defect density of the perovskite, enhances the excited state and charge transport performance, and significantly mitigates perovskite film decomposition and morphology deterioration in the hole transport layer at elevated temperatures. By incorporating the MF interlayer, we successfully fabricate 85 °C long-term stable solar cells, utilizing light absorption layers based on a triple-cation perovskite and FAPbI3 perovskite, achieving initial average efficiencies of 22.2% and 23.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the solar cell employing the MF-modified triple cation perovskite exhibits exceptional operational stability at 65 °C under full sunlight irradiation.

In the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered significant attention, with much research focused on enhancing their power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, their durability has emerged as a pressing concern. To address this, researchers have endeavored to improve the stability of PSCs by adjusting the composition and interface of perovskite films, replacing charge transport layers, and developing new encapsulation methods. Among these approaches, the interface layer between the perovskite layer and the charge transport layer has proven to be pivotal in enhancing both the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This layer can passivate surface defects, block inter-diffusion of species between different layers, and reduce interface charge recombination. Achieving optimal performance requires fine-tuning the thickness of the interface layer to minimize interface charge recombination while maintaining charge separation yield and without excessively increasing the interface charge injection resistance.

The interface layer can interact with perovskite surface atoms through strong ionic or covalent bonds or, more commonly, through weak non-covalent interactions. However, interface layers composed of small molecules typically exhibit weak intermolecular interactions, rendering them vulnerable to performance degradation under conditions such as device operation or accelerated aging. In contrast, polymer interface materials, particularly cross-linked network polymers, are expected to possess superior mechanical and chemical stability and adhere more firmly to the perovskite surface, resulting in reduced susceptibility to performance degradation.
Melamine formaldehyde resin (MF) (Fig. 1) is a thermosetting resin composed of melamine rings terminated with multiple hydroxyl groups derived from formaldehyde. This plastic material possesses exceptional properties, including high thermal stability, flame retardancy, and moisture resistance. Commercial MF resin is insoluble and infusible. Typically, MF resin forms through the condensation of formaldehyde with melamine, yielding, under idealized conditions, the hexa-hydroxymethyl derivative. Upon heating in the presence of an acid, this or a similar hydroxymethylated species undergoes further condensation and crosslinking, with linkages between the heterocycles including mono-, di-, and polyethers. Hexakis(methoxymethyl)melamine (HMMM, Fig. 1), a fine powder with good chemical stability at room temperature, can dissolve in organic solvents orthogonal to perovskites, such as isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene.
In this study, we spin-coated a certain concentration of HMMM isopropanol solution onto the surface of a perovskite. After heating at 80 °C for several minutes, HMMM underwent in situ polymerization on the surface of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites to form an ultrathin MF film, which effectively reduced the defect density of the perovskite film and significantly improved its thermal stability. Combining it with a hole transport layer (HTL) with a high glass transition temperature, we successfully fabricated efficient and thermally stable PSCs using the MF interfacial layer.

Previous studies have demonstrated that hexakis(methoxymethyl)melamine (HMMM) undergoes hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form hexakis(hydroxymethyl)melamine (HMM, Fig. 1), which subsequently condenses at 150 °C to form a melamine formaldehyde (MF) network structure. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether HMMM can undergo condensation on the surface of a hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite film at relatively low temperatures. We used a triple-cation alloy perovskite (CsMAFA) with the chemical formula (CsPbI3)0.05(MAPbBr3)0.075(FAPbI3)0.875(PbI2)0.03, where MA and FA represent methylammonium and formamidinium cations, respectively. We spin-coated a solution of 2 mg mL−1 HMMM in isopropanol onto the surface of the CsMAFA film, which was on the glass substrate.

Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) measurements showed that upon heating the HMMM-coated CsMAFA film at 80 °C for 30 min in air, the absorption from the methoxy group exhibited a detectable decrease while the absorption from the triazine ring remained constant (Fig. 2A). Notably, HMMM coated on glass under the same conditions showed no changes in infrared absorption. In the MF-modified CsMAFA film, the infrared absorptions at 1396 cm−1 and 1489 cm−1 arise from the coupling of the triazine ring semi-circle stretching, the exogenous C–N bond contraction, and the CH2 twisting, while the absorption at 1563 cm−1 arises from the coupling of the triazine ring quadrant stretching vibration and the CH2 bending vibration (Fig. 2B).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements reveal that the crystal structure and orientation of the CsMAFA perovskite film remain unaltered following modification with MF (Fig. S1A). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggest that the MF layer formed on the surface of the perovskite is exceedingly thin and does not significantly alter the surface morphology (Fig. S1B and C). Deconvolution of the N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) signal of the CsMAFA film modified with MF reveals three distinct nitrogen species on the surface (Fig. 2C). These nitrogen species are attributed to N in the FA cation (with a binding energy of 400.3 eV), sp3 N in MF (with a binding energy of 400.2 eV), and sp2 N in MF (with a binding energy of 398.8 eV). Furthermore, the characteristic XPS signals of Pb 4f7/2, Pb 4f5/2, I 3d5/2, and I 3d3/2 from the CsMAFA film shift by approximately 0.5 eV towards lower binding energy after modification with MF (Fig. 2D and E). This could be ascribed to the electron-donation from the lone pair electrons of nitrogen and oxygen in MF to the lead and iodine in perovskite. The differential charge density depicted in Fig. 3 indicates electron transfer from MF to the perovskite.
Moreover, electronic absorption measurements indicate that the optical density and optical bandgap of the CsMAFA film remain unaltered after modification with the MF layer (Fig. S1D). Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that the CsMAFA perovskite film deposited on glass displays biexponential PL decay when excited by picosecond laser pulses, with an amplitude-averaged lifetime (τ) of 2.18 μs (Fig. S1E). However, for the CsMAFA film with MF modification, the τ is extended to 3.46 μs. It appears that the MF interface layer mitigates nonradiative recombination channels assisted by deep traps. To assess the effect of MF modification on the defect density of the CsMAFA film, electron-only and hole-only devices were constructed. Details of the device fabrication and testing procedures are provided in the Experimental section of the ESI. Space charge limited current measurements and analyses reveal that surface modification with MF reduces the density of electron defects in the CsMAFA film from 1.24 × 1015 cm−3 to 1.06 × 1015 cm−3, and the density of hole defects from 2.12 × 1015 cm−3 to 1.72 × 1015 cm−3. Additionally, MF modification elevates the electron mobility of the CsMAFA film from 1.48 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 2.10 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the hole mobility from 3.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 4.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.
To investigate the thermal stability of perovskite films, we deposited polystyrene and gold layers sequentially on the aforementioned films and encapsulated them with epoxy resin. The samples were then placed in an 85 °C oven with relative humidity ranging from 40% to 90%. After 2000 h, the τ of the CsMAFA film without MF modification sharply decreased from 2180 ns to 323 ns (Fig. S1E and F). Under humid and high-temperature conditions, the perovskite film degraded, resulting in deeper energy level defects and faster nonradiative recombination. In contrast, although the τ of the modified MF sample also shortened, it remained relatively long at 974 ns. Additionally, for the unmodified MF sample, the diffraction intensity of PbI2 increased by 8.3 times after aging (Fig. S1G), while the amplification was reduced to 3.1 times for the modified MF sample (Fig. S1H). Based on these results, we conclude that on the surface of the CsMAFA perovskite, HMMM can undergo thermal condensation to form an ultrathin MF resin layer. The MF layer effectively reduces the defect density of the perovskite, improves the excited state and charge transport performance, and, most importantly, mitigates the degradation of the perovskite film at high temperatures.
PSCs with an FTO/TiO2/CsMAFA/HTL/Au structure were fabricated, and the HTL was composed of molecular semiconductor TBTA[6]H and air-doping promoter TBPHTFSI at a mass ratio of 85:15. For their molecular structures, see Fig. S2. The HTL had a glass transition temperature of 112 °C and a direct-current conductivity of 353 μS cm−1. Various intermolecular noncovalent interactions such as CH⋯O, CH⋯N, π⋯π, and CH⋯π may exist between the MF layer and the HTL, ensuring good adhesion between these layers. The cells were subjected to simulated AM 1.5G sunlight at 100 mW cm−2, and the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the encapsulated cells were measured. Detailed information on device fabrication and testing is provided in the Experimental section of the ESI. Comparing the forward and reverse scan J–V curves (Fig. S3), we observed that both cells, with and without MF modification, exhibited small hysteresis. Statistical analyses of short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are presented in Fig. 4A–D. Compared to the cells without MF, the cells with MF demonstrate higher JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE. The PCE of the MF-modified cells ranges from 22.0% to 22.5%. Fig. 4E shows representative reverse scan J–V curves, and Table 1 lists the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The cell with the MF interface layer had a JSC of 24.57 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.130 V, FF of 0.800, and PCE of 22.2%, which were significantly higher than those of the cell without MF modification (JSC = 24.47 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.100 V, FF = 0.779, and PCE = 21.0%). It should be noted that, for the CsMAFA perovskite, the optimal temperature for MF polymerization was 80 °C in terms of PCE (Fig. S4). At lower temperatures, HMMM did not polymerize efficiently to form a thick enough interlayer for performance enhancement. If the temperature was too high, it led to a too thick MF tunnelling layer which impeded hole injection and resulted in worse device performance.

Consistent with a higher built-in voltage (Vbi), the MF-modified cell had a higher VOC (Fig. 4F). The impedance spectra of PSCs were measured at a series of potential biases. Two key physical parameters, recombination resistance (Rre) and hole transport resistance (Rtr), were numerically modelled using a simplified equivalent circuit presented in Fig. S5A. Impedance analysis indicated that the higher VOC in the MF-modified cell was related to its larger charge recombination resistance Rre (Fig. 4G). Specifically, the cells without and with MF exhibit Rre values of 1.7 kΩ and 3.6 kΩ, respectively, at a bias potential of 0.9 V (Fig. 4H), upon fitting the impedance spectra presented in Fig S5B. In addition, we measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4I) and combined them with the standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum to predict the photocurrent densities (JEQESC) of the solar cells under AM 1.5G conditions. The JEQESC values of the cells without and with MF modification were 24.06 mA cm−2 and 24.14 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4J), which were not significantly different from the JSC values measured by J–V analysis, suggesting that the solar simulator used had a small mismatch factor.
To evaluate the operational stability of the PSCs, we conducted maximum power point (MPP) tracking measurements in a nitrogen atmosphere at 65 °C. The evolutions of the maximum power point photocurrent density (JMPP), the maximum power point voltage (VMPP), and the maximum power point power conversion efficiency (PCEMPP) under one-sun equivalent white light emitting diode irradiation are presented in Fig. 4M–O. Following a 200 h test period, we observed a decline in PCEMPP of the MF-modified cell from 19.1% to 17.5%, with a retention rate of 92%. The retention rates for JMPP and VMPP were 100% and 92%, respectively. Note that the cell presents a temperature-dependent efficiency with a room temperature PCE of 22.4% prior to the operational test.
Next, the cells were subjected to a 2000 h stability test at 85 °C, and the evolution of PCE over time is shown in Fig. S6. Representative J–V curves of the aged cells are plotted in Fig. 4E, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1 for comparison with unaged cells. Remarkably, after 2000 h of aging, the cells with the MF layer (initial PCE: 22.2%) retained a PCE of 18.5% with a retention rate of 83%, which is higher than the 76% retention rate for the cell without the MF layer (initial PCE: 21.0%). The decay rates of FF, JSC, and VOC for the cell without MF were 13%, 10%, and 1%, respectively, while the cell with MF exhibited relatively smaller decay rates for FF and JSC, which were 12% and 5%, respectively, and VOC remained constant. Both aged and unaged cells displayed a linear correlation between JSC and JEQESC (Fig. S7). Thermal aging caused a decrease in the Vbi of the cells, with the cell without MF exhibiting a Vbi decrease of about 30 mV, whereas the MF-modified cell experienced a decrease of less than 5 mV (Fig. 4F). Aging also resulted in a smaller decrease in Vbi for the cell with MF (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, after aging, the increase in interfacial charge density (N) of the cell without MF was 47% (Fig. 4K), indicating a remarkable increase in interfacial defects. However, the increase in N of the MF-modified cell was smaller, at 22%.
Unexpectedly, thermal aging at 85 °C resulted in an increase in the intensity of PL in perovskite solar cells. The τ of PL in the cell without MF increased from 12 ns to 33 ns, whereas for the MF-modified cell, the τ increased from 15 ns to 20 ns (Fig. 4L). This observation suggests that the aging process generates species with deeper valence bands between the perovskite and HTL. However, it is important to note that aging also caused a decrease in the excited-state lifetime of the perovskite film not in contact with the electron and hole transport layers. The charge separation yields of the aged cells were estimated, with 89% for the cell without MF and 98% for the cell with MF, which directly correlate with the EQE heights and short-circuit current densities. Subsequently, the gold electrode and encapsulation materials were removed with care for further characterization. After aging, the cells showed a decrease in optical density (Fig. 5A and B), with a greater reduction observed in the cell without MF.
To scrutinize potential changes in the morphology of the HTL resulting from thermal aging, we employed scanning electron microscopy to analyze our samples. We found no significant differences in the surface morphology of HTLs in the unaged cells, regardless of the presence or absence of the MF interface layer (Fig. S8A and B). The polycrystalline structure of the underlying CsMAFA film was only faintly visible due to electron beam filtering by the HTL. However, after aging, submicron-sized voids appeared in the HTL deposited on the perovskite film without MF (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the morphology of the HTL on the MF-modified perovskite film remained intact (Fig. 5D). Our control experiment demonstrated that the morphology of the TBTA[6]H-based HTL deposited on glass does not change after aging at 85 °C. These findings suggest that introducing a robust interface layer can effectively prevent damage to the morphology of the HTL induced by perovskite thermal decomposition. The presence of some voids in the HTL is expected to impede hole injection and transport in the cell and could even result in direct micro-contact between perovskite and gold, ultimately leading to cell degradation.
To examine how the thermal aging affects the morphology and composition of the perovskite layers, we used a chlorobenzene spin-coating method to remove the HTL layer. The PL spectra in Fig. 5E and F reveal an increase in G-band emissions centered at 620 nm from PbI2 in the aged samples, with a smaller enhancement observed for the MF-modified cell. Actually, the SEM images in Fig. S8C and D for the unaged cell show closely packed perovskite grains, and no apparent structural features can be observed from the fluorescence optical microscope (FOM) images in Fig. S8E and F. In contrast, the SEM images of the perovskite film in the aged cell without MF depict sub-micron cracks at the grain boundaries, with some grain surfaces exhibiting corrosion (Fig. 5G). The areas where the morphology changed appear brighter due to electron accumulation, indicating a reduction in electron conductivity at these locations. Additionally, the FOM image shows the presence of elongated PbI2 microcrystals in the perovskite layer of the aged cell without MF (Fig. 5I). In contrast, the MF-modified perovskite layer in the aged cell exhibits no apparent voids or corrosion in the SEM image (Fig. 5H), with only point-like PbI2 particles displaying less emission visible in the FOM image (Fig. 5J).
The perovskite layers in the unaged cells exhibited infrared absorption at 3280 cm−1, attributed to the symmetric stretching vibration of N–H in the FA cation. Furthermore, absorptions at 3354 cm−1 and 3417 cm−1 arose from the asymmetric stretching vibration of N–H in the FA cation (Fig. 6A and B). After aging, the intensity of these absorption peaks showed varying degrees of attenuation. A relative attenuation of 21% was observed in the sample without MF, while the sample with MF showed a relatively smaller attenuation of 17%. Moreover, absorptions due to the N–H stretching vibration of –NH3+ and C–H bending vibration of –CH3 were detected near 3190 cm−1 and 1400 cm−1, respectively.
XPS measurements indicated that the perovskite film for the unaged cell almost completely lacked MA (Fig. 6C and E), suggesting that the MA at the surface was lost during the 120 °C annealing. In contrast, the aged cells exhibited higher MA content at the surface of the perovskite film (Fig. 6D), with a slightly smaller increase observed in the cell with MF (Fig. 6F). This increase is likely related to the decomposition of the perovskite film. After thermal aging, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Pb 4f increased, indicating more types of Pb species at the surface of the perovskite film. For the cell without MF, the FWHM of Pb 4f increased by 20 meV, whereas for the MF-modified cell, it increased by 10 meV, suggesting that the MF interface layer can dampen changes in compositions at the surface of the perovskite layer. SEM, FOM, ATR-FTIR, and XPS measurements show that the perovskite light-absorption layer decomposes to some extent after thermal aging, and the morphology of the HTL covering its surface also deteriorates. Nevertheless, introducing an MF interlayer can reduce or inhibit these degradations.
We also fabricated PSCs with the spiro-OMeTAD based HTL, again proving the role of the MF layer in improving VOC and PCE (Fig. S9). Furthermore, we extended our study to evaluate the efficacy of the MF interfacial layer in PSCs based on the FAPbI3 light absorption layer. The device structure is ITO/SnO2/FAPbI3/HTL/Au. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2, we observed a notable improvement in PCE from 22.0% to 23.7% for typical cells primarily due to improvements in the values of VOC and FF. Moreover, after exposure to a temperature of 85 °C for 500 h, the retention rate of the FAPbI3 based cell increased from 52% to 80% with the aid of MF. In the present work, we focused on the in situ polymerized MF interlayer between the perovskite and HTL for performance enhancement. However, if the interface between the electron-transport layer and perovskite is further optimized, enhanced device efficiency and stability could be expected in future extended studies.

To summarize, we have demonstrated the in situ polymerization of hexakis(methoxymethyl)melamine on the surface of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, resulting in the formation of a melamine formaldehyde resin interlayer. Our findings reveal that the polymeric network interlayer can effectively reduce the density of traps in perovskite films, enhance carrier mobility, and increase the excited state lifetime, resulting in an overall improvement in the power conversion efficiency of solar cells. Furthermore, the presence of the polymeric resin interlayer improves the thermostability of perovskite films by mitigating their decomposition at high temperatures while maintaining the morphology of the hole transport layer. These results underscore the potential of our approach for the development of high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.
