Increasing interest has been devoted to developing high-performance all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) owing to their specific advantages in light absorption and long-term stability. In this work, we systematically investigated the synergistic effects of processing solvents and molecular weight on the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, which consist of an n-type polymer N2200 and a p-type wide bandgap polymer PTzBI that are made up of benzodithiophene and imide-functionalized benzotriazole units. It is noted that increasing the molecular weight of N2200 can simultaneously enhance exciton generation and dissociation, reduce bimolecular recombination, and facilitate charge extraction. The films processed with the environmentally-friendly solvent 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) exhibit a more favourable film morphology than those processed with commonly used halogenated solvents. The all-PSC consisting of the high molecular weight N2200 and PTzBI processed with the environmentally friendly solvent MeTHF presents a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 9.16%, which is the highest value so far observed for all-PSCs. Of particular interest is that the PCE remains 6.37% with the active layer thickness of 230 nm. These observations imply the great promise of the developed all-PSCs for practical applications toward high-throughput roll-to-roll technology.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are a type of thin-film solar cell consisting of polymeric semiconducting materials, which can convert green energy to urgently needed electrical energy and can be manufactured through continuous roll-to-roll processing. Among the so far developed PSCs, the cases consisting of all polymers (all-PSCs) in the active layer are of particular interest on account of their light weight, flexibility, and long-term stability. Recently, all-PSCs with improved power conversion efficiencies have been produced, yet the photoactive layers are typically processed using chlorinated solvents, which are harmful to both the environment and human beings. Much effort has been devoted to processing all-PSCs with reduced contaminants for the environment and organisms by using a nontoxic solvent that can be obtained from sustainable resources. Although a variety of achievements have enabled the utilization of low-toxic or nontoxic solvents in fabricating fullerene-based PSCs, high-performance all-PSCs processed with such an environmentally friendly solvent remain a great challenge. To address this issue, we demonstrate a case of fabricating highly efficient all-PSCs by using a green solvent of 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran. Our findings imply the great potential of using green solvents for fabricating high performance all-PSCs.


Recently, polymer solar cells (PSCs) with remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been achieved, for which the photoactive layers comprise either a fullerene acceptor or a non-fullerene molecular acceptor. Tremendous progress has also been realized in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) that utilise a p-type conjugated polymer as a donor and an n-type conjugated polymer in the photoactive layer. Generally, compared to conventional PSCs, all-PSCs demonstrate enhanced light absorption, superior optical, thermal and mechanical stability, and straightforward modification of their chemical and electronic properties. As the morphological stability of the active layers plays a crucial issue for future large-scale roll-to-roll production, much research effort has been devoted to controlling the aggregation behaviour of the polymer chains and the blend film morphology by developing new polymer acceptors, regulating the molecular weights of the polymer donors or acceptors and optimising film deposition conditions, including the processing solvents and solvent additives used.

It has been shown that the boiling point and volatility of processing solvents have a significant effect on the film formation of active layers during the spin-coating process. Chloroform (CF), which has a low boiling point and good solubility for conjugated polymers, has been widely used for producing all-PSCs to control the large domains in blend films. However, as is typical of halogenated solvents, CF is considered inevitably to be a contaminant in drinking water and is toxic to various organisms. Additionally, the high-energy syntheses and expensive storage or waste disposal make halogenated solvents unfavourable in terms of sustainable development. Attempts have been made to find non-halogenated solvents suitable for the fabrication of the active layers in PSCs. These solvents include 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF), toluene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, as well as some solvent blends, such as mesitylene/acetophenone. MeTHF has a boiling point of about 80 °C, which is suitable for fabricating all-PSCs. Furthermore, MeTHF has superior physical (water azeotrope, lower volatility) and chemical properties (great acid/base stability, high flash point) to CF, and is obtainable from renewable biomass sources, which makes it an environmentally benign solvent.
Because the boiling point of MeTHF permits the well-controlled aggregation of polymer domains and because of its low toxicity in the human body and the environment, we investigated its use in fabricating all-PSCs. The active layer of the all-PSCs fabricated consisted of a wide-bandgap electron-donating polymer, poly{4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-4,8-di(thien-2-yl)-6-octyl-2-octyl-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)-dione} (PTzBI), and a typical electron-withdrawing polymer, poly{[N,N-9-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200). Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1a. Three N2200 samples, with number–average molecular weights (Mn) of 75.1, 37.4 and 20.4 kg mol−1, denoted as N2200HW, N2200MW and N2200LW, respectively, were used in this study. The synergistic effects of processing solvents and molecular weight on the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs were investigated.

From the UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine PTzBI and N2200 films (Fig. 1b), it can be seen that pure films of N2200 exhibit two distinct absorption bands, located in the range of 300–440 and 500–860 nm, with peak absorption occurring at about 390 and 700 nm, respectively. This absorption profile complements the absorption profile of the PTzBI film, which has an absorption peak at 590 nm located within the main absorption band ranging from 420 to 685 nm. Therefore, PTzBI can be paired with N2200 to achieve improved light absorbance. Additionally, the absorption coefficients of N2200 films depend on their molecular weights. The N2200HW film exhibited the highest absorption coefficient, with two peaks at 8.2 × 104 and 6.6 × 104 cm−1. This was comparable to the peak absorption (7.7 × 104 cm−1) of PTzBI. The absorption coefficients of the N2200HW and PTZBI films were significantly higher than those of the N2200MW and N2200LW films. Moreover, the N2200LW film showed a slightly stronger and broader absorbance than N2200MW, which may be attributable to the strong aggregation properties of N2200LW.


Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of PTzBI:N2200 (1:0.5, wt:wt) blends in solutions of o-DCB, CF and MeTHF. The absorption profile of PTzBI:N2200 in MeTHF shows bathochromic shifts of about 40 and 60 nm with respect to its absorption profiles in o-DCB and CF, respectively, implying the formation of aggregates in MeTHF solution. From the images of o-DCB, CF and MeTHF solutions of PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt; 0.5 mg mL−1) (Fig. 2b), it is evident that the MeTHF solution was much darker in colour than the o-DCB and CF solutions. Moreover, the films deposited from different solvents were different, as the aggregates can be transferred into blends and affect the textures of the films. Hence, the film deposited from MeTHF exhibited the highest absorption coefficient (Fig. 2c). Analysis of the absorption of PTzBI:N2200 films produced with different molecular weight N2200 indicated that the absorption coefficient increased with molecular weight (Fig. 2d). Thus, using a higher molecular weight N2200 may improve the light-harvesting properties of PTzBI:N2200 films.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performances of devices based on PTzBI:N2200 films, we fabricated all-PSCs with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFNDI-Br/Al architecture (Fig. 1a), where the active layers consisted of N2200 with various molecular weights. To facilitate charge extraction from the active layer, a thin layer of poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide]dibromide (PFNDI-Br) was used as the cathode interlayer. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these devices were measured under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The initial optimisation of the devices was carried out by tuning the solvent additives and the thermal annealing temperatures for MeTHF-processed all-PSCs. The incorporation of solvent additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenylether (DPE) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), did not improve the PCEs (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI). The optimised device, based on a PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt) film, demonstrated a PCE of 6.55%. The PCEs were improved by thermal annealing at 130 °C for 10 min (Fig. S2 and Table S2 in the ESI).

Using PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt) as the photoactive layer, the device processed with o-DCB exhibited a relatively low PCE of 1.21% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.87 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 2.18 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 63.73%. The device processed with CF had a PCE of 5.27% (VOC = 0.85 V, JSC = 9.45 mA cm−2 and FF = 65.68%). The device performance can be dramatically enhanced by processing with MeTHF, which presents an impressive PCE of 8.06% (VOC = 0.86 V, JSC = 14.87 mA cm−2 and FF = 63.02%). In contrast, devices based on PTzBI:N2200MW and PTzBI:N2200LW films processed with MeTHF demonstrated significantly lower PCEs of 5.67 and 4.86%, respectively. This can be attributed to the decreased JSC and FF values. The relevant J–V characteristics of these devices are illustrated in Fig. 3a and photovoltaic parameters are summarised in Table 1.

It is worth noting that at a high temperature of 100 °C, the PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt) can easily be dissolved in MeTHF at a high concentration of 15 mg mL−1 (Table S5, ESI). Although the solution becomes more viscous after cooling down to room temperature of about 20 °C, no solids precipitated from the solution, and the solution still can be used for fabricating thin films by the spin-coating technique.
To confirm the accuracy of the JSC measurements, we integrated the relevant current densities from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3b and c). All of the devices had a broad EQE response from 300 to 850 nm. The device based on the PTzBI:N2200HW film processed with MeTHF exhibited a significantly higher EQE response across almost the entire spectral region than the devices processed with o-DCB and CF. This is particularly evident in the long-wave band, 700–850 nm, which is consistent with the significantly higher JSC values of the MeTHF-processed devices. In addition, the current densities obtained from the integrated EQE spectra were in good agreement with those obtained from J–V measurements; there were variations between the two sets of data of 3–6%.

To further understand the effects of the processing solvents and molecular weight on the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, we measured the photocurrent (Jph) against the effective applied voltage (Veff) for each of the devices. Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in darkness, respectively. Veff is equal to V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Vappl is the applied bias. As shown in Fig. 3d, Jph is saturated when Veff is about 2 V. Therefore, the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) can be estimated from the equation Jsat = q·L·Gmax, where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density, q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer in the devices. The calculated Gmax values of the devices are summarised in Table S5 (ESI). The PTzBI:N2200HW device processed with MeTHF had the highest Gmax value (9.28 × 1027 m−3 s−1), which was slightly higher than the calculated Gmax values for PTzBI:N2200MW (9.17 × 1027 m−3 s−1) and PTzBI:N2200LW (8.03 × 1027 m−3 s−1) devices processed with MeTHF, and significantly higher than those for the PTzBI:N2200HW devices processed with o-DCB (1.64 × 1027 m−3 s−1) and CF (6.44 × 1027 m−3 s−1). These findings indicate that the exciton generation of the MeTHF-processed devices is faster than their o-DCB- and CF-processed counterparts, which agrees with the corresponding JSC values.

In addition, the values of the exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) can be obtained from the Jph/Jsatversus Veff curves (Fig. S5, ESI), using the equation P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat. Because the P(E,T) values can be used to evaluate exciton dissociation efficiencies, we calculated the P(E,T) values under short-circuit conditions (Veff = V0; Table S5, ESI). The PTzBI:N2200HW device processed with MeTHF exhibited the highest P(E,T) value (92.77%). Therefore, based on the Gmax and P(E,T) values, we propose that this device had a high exciton generation rate and a high exciton dissociation efficiency, both of which produced a high current density.
To investigate the primary charge recombination mechanism in the all-PSCs, we measured the dependence of J–V characteristics on light intensity. As shown in Fig. 4a, we varied the light intensity from 5 to 100 mW cm−2. In general, the power law dependence of JSC upon illumination intensity can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Plight)S, where Plight is the light intensity, and S is an exponential factor that approaches unity when the bimolecular recombination is weak. The S values calculated for the all-PSCs are summarised in Table S6 (ESI). All of the N2200HW-based devices had higher S values (up to 0.94) than the N2200MW (0.935) and N2200LW (0.927) devices, indicating that bimolecular recombination was suppressed by N2200HW. These observations agree with the FF of >63% obtained for all N2200HW-based devices. In addition, the S value (0.965) of the PTzBI:N2200HW device processed with MeTHF was closest to unity, implying that weaker bimolecular recombination improves the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs.
Transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were taken to probe the competition between carrier sweep-out by the internal field and recombination in the all-PSCs. The TPC measurements were carried out at 0 bias, where the charge extraction time τ was obtained by nonlinearly fitting the curves of JSCversus time with the relevant characteristics shown in Fig. 4b. For the devices based on PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt) processed with o-DCB and CF, the measured values of τ were 0.27 and 0.26 μs, respectively (Table S6, ESI). Processing with MeTHF reduced τ to 0.18 μs. This demonstrates the significance of using MeTHF as the processing solvent to improve the charge extraction efficiency. The measured values of τ of the MeTHF-processed devices based on PTzBI:N2200MW (1:0.5, wt:wt) and PTzBI:N2200LW (1:0.5, wt:wt) were 0.22 and 0.24 μs, respectively. Both of these values were larger than the device based on N2200HW, implying that using a high molecular weight N2200 can improve the current density, and thus the overall photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs.

As the film morphology plays a critical role in the photovoltaic performance, we investigated the morphologies of the blend films using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The relevant images are shown in Fig. 5. Discrepancies are evident in the surface topographies of the blend film of PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt) processed with o-DCB, CF and MeTHF from the AFM images (Fig. 5a–c). The films processed with both o-DCB and CF exhibit relatively rough surfaces, with root-mean-square (RMS) values of 1.70 and 2.29 nm, respectively. The film processed with MeTHF shows a relatively flat surface, with an RMS of 0.79 nm. The blend films of PTzBI:N2200MW and PTzBI:N2200LW processed with MeTHF (Fig. 5d and e) had slightly higher RMS values than the equivalent PTzBI:N2200HW film; however, their relatively smooth surface morphologies demonstrated that MeTHF is the most suitable solvent for this blend system.

TEM measurements were carried out to examine the phase separation of the blend films. Large-scale lumpen features can be seen in the TEM image of the PTzBI:N2200HW film processed with o-DCB (Fig. 5f). These features may be caused by strong aggregation during the film deposition procedure. The film processed with CF (Fig. 5g) had a thick, fibrous texture across the entire blend film, which seemingly reduced its photovoltaic performance. Conversely, the PTzBI:N2200HW blend film processed with MeTHF exhibited a homogeneous morphology with finely divided domains (Fig. 5h), which improved the charge separation and charge carrier transport. PTzBI:N2200 blend films based on lower molecular weight N2200 (N2200MW and N2200LW) showed enlarged mesh- or wire-like structures (Fig. 5j and k) that may be attributable to their stronger crystallisation properties. This morphology may account for their reduced photovoltaic performances.

To study the synergistic effects of processing solvents and the molecular weight of N2200 on the bulk charge carrier mobility of the blend films, we measured the hole and electron mobilities using hole- and electron-only devices, with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFNDI-Br/Al structures, respectively. The mobilities were evaluated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The recorded J1/2–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The extracted hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) are summarised in Table S6 (ESI). The MeTHF-processed device based on PTzBI:N2200HW exhibited the highest μh (1.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (5.72 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) values. These were significantly higher than those of the o-DCB and CF-processed devices (μh/μe values of 4.17 × 10−6/1.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.75 × 10−6/4.96 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) and those of the blend films consisting of lower molecular weight N2200. The carrier mobilities of PTzBI:N2200HW were consistent with its superior photovoltaic performance, which encouraged us to fabricate all-PSCs with thicker active layers.

We measured the photovoltaic performance of MeTHF-processed PTzBI:N2200HW devices with active layer thicknesses from 120 to 230 nm. The J–V characteristics were measured under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarised in Table 2. One can apparently observe that by increasing the thickness of the photoactive layer to about 120 nm, a remarkable PCE of 8.72% (VOC = 0.860 V, JSC = 15.97 mA cm−2, and FF = 63.47%) can be achieved. The efficiency can be further improved by using the film-aging method, which has been used to delicately optimize the film morphology in all-PSCs based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) polymer acceptors. After aging the photoactive layer at 20 °C under vacuum for 12 h, the PCE can be further improved to 9.16% (VOC = 0.844 V, JSC = 15.48 mA cm−2, and FF = 70.10%). To our knowledge, this is the highest PCE so far observed for all-PSCs. Of particular importance is that this PCE is achieved by using a non-chlorinated, environmentally friendly solvent (MeTHF). Although the JSC and FF values of the devices gradually decreased as the thickness of the photoactive layer increased, a PCE of 6.37% was achieved with a film thickness of 230 nm, which is the highest value reported for an all-PSC with an active layer of over 200 nm. These observations indicate the great promise of the all-polymer photoactive layer consisting of PTzBI and N2200 for practical applications, such as high-throughput roll-to-roll polymer solar cells.

As PSCs with inverted geometry exhibit better ambient stability than the conventional counterparts, we fabricated the inverted devices with the architecture of ITO/ZnO/PFN-OX/PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt)/MoO3/Ag. The control device showed a moderate PCE of 7.32% (VOC = 0.84 V, JSC = 13.78 mA cm−2, and FF = 63.33%), which is slightly decreased to 7.15% (VOC = 0.84 V, JSC = 13.27 mA cm−2, and FF = 64.11%) after thermal treatment at 130 °C for 120 min (Table S8, ESI), indicating the excellent thermal stability. Note this observation is reproducible for 12 devices. In contrast, although the conventional devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS present a much higher PCE of 8.72%, the PCE obviously decreased to 6.95% (VOC = 0.80 V, JSC = 15.45 mA cm−2, and FF = 56.17%) after thermal treatment at 130 °C for 120 min (Fig. S6 and Table S8, ESI). As the degradation stems from both VOC and FF gradually decreasing upon thermal treatment, and the JSC does not show a dramatic variation, it is reasonable to correlate the slightly reduced VOC and FF to the unstable interface between PEDOT:PSS and the photoactive layer. Moreover, it is also noted that the PCE slightly decreased from 8.96% to 7.88% upon continuous illumination for 12 h under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. S7 and Table S9, ESI), demonstrating the outstanding photo-stability of the fabricated PTzBI:N2200HW based device.
For all-PSCs, considering that the PCEs observed from conventional devices outperform the inverted counterparts, further evaluation of device stability is performed based on conventional devices that are thermally annealed at a moderate temperature of 80 °C. It is noted that the PCE of the resulting devices slightly decreased from 8.91 ± 0.21% to 8.38 ± 0.14% after thermal treatment for 24 h (Fig. S8 and Table S10, ESI), indicating that they are much more stable than those annealed at a high temperature of 130 °C. Additionally, we also fabricated devices based on PTzBI:PC71BM for comparison. These fullerene-based devices also exhibited a quite stable photovoltaic performance, with the PCE slightly decreasing from 7.57 ± 0.15% to 7.04 ± 0.10% after thermal treatment for 24 h (Fig. S8 and Table S10, ESI). The surface textures of PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt) and PTzBI:PC71BM (1:1, wt:wt) after thermal treatment at 80 °C were investigated by AFM and optical microscopy (OM) measurements (Fig. S9, ESI). It is noted that the surface morphology of both blend films remained nearly unchanged after thermal annealing at 80 °C up to 24 h, which indicates the excellent morphological stability of these blend films. These observations are consistent with the observed stable photovoltaic performances of the fabricated devices. The detailed investigations of the evolution of the film morphology, which can be described by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and photovoltaic parameters as a function of aging time, are still in progress in our lab, and will be reported in future work. Nevertheless, our current findings demonstrate the outstanding stability and great promise of the developed PTzBI:N2200-based all-PSC toward practical applications.

In summary, we have demonstrated a high PCE of 9.16% in PTzBI:N2200-based all-PSCs processed using a green solvent, MeTHF. The active layer consists of a wide-bandgap polymer donor, PTzBI, which demonstrates absorption complementary to the polymer acceptor N2200. By studying the synergistic effects of the molecular weight of N2200 polymers and the processing solvent on the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, we conclude that increasing the molecular weight of N2200 can enhance the maximum exciton generation rate, improve the exciton dissociation probability, reduce bimolecular recombination and facilitate charge extraction in all-polymer devices. In addition, the environmentally friendly solvent MeTHF affords more preferable film morphology than commonly used solvents. Correspondingly, MeTHF-processed all-PSCs based on PTzBI:N2200HW (1:0.5, wt:wt) show thickness-insensitive properties and a PCE of 6.37% when the active layer thickness is 230 nm. These results demonstrate the plausibility of this process for the fabrication of high-performance large-area all-PSCs.
