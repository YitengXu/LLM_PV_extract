In the present article, vertically aligned ZnO nanorod arrays were synthesized by an aqueous chemical growth (ACG) route on a fluoride doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate. These nanorods were further sensitized with cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots (QDs) by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The synthesized CdS coated ZnO nanorods were characterized for their structural and morphological properties with X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Finally, prepared CdS coated 1D ZnO photoelectrodes were tested for their photoelectrochemical performance. Our results show that the sample deposited after 40 SILAR cycles shows 5.61 mA cm−2 short current density (JSC) with η = 1.61% power conversion efficiency.

Gratzel solar cells {or dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)} and quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are the most promising low cost and highly efficient 3rd generation solar cells. These photovoltaic technologies facilitate several advantages over their first and second generation counterparts. Easy process-ability and low cost production are the major features of these photovoltaic technologies. However, because of the volatility of the electrolytes due to their non-aqueous nature, a problem of effective dye loading and the low absorption coefficient of dye materials, DSSCs suffer from a low conversion efficiency. On the other hand, due to the higher molar extinction coefficient of QDs in comparison to that of ruthenium complexes and organic dyes, tunable energy gaps and multiple exciton generation, which may potentially lead to a theoretical maximum efficiency higher than that of conventional DSSCs, QDSSCs have recently garnered attention. Generally, QDSSCs consist of wide band gap n-type semiconducting materials (TiO2 or ZnO) which are sensitized by visible bang gap semiconducting materials like CdS, PbS, CdSeetc. A platinum-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (Pt/FTO) electrode acts as a cathode and the Na2S aqueous redox couple (S2−/Sn2−) as an electrolyte. However, these cells suffer from a high recombination rate and low stability.

On the other hand, 1D ZnO nanorod arrays have demonstrated great application in QDSSCs. 1D ZnO nanorod arrays could provide a higher interfacial area and faster electrical pathways for the transport of electrons to increase effective light trapping and hence, the photo-electric conversion efficiency (PCE). Recently, a variety of ZnO nanostructures have been developed by aqueous chemical growth like nanorods, bottle brush, cactietc. These morphologies are very useful for effective light harvesting and fast electron transportation.
In this article, we have synthesized 1D ZnO nanorods by a simple aqueous chemical growth (ACG) technique and sensitized them with CdS QDs by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. The SILAR cycles have been optimized with their photoelectrochemical performance. The SILAR technique facilitates a room temperature and cost effective method and has the potential for large-scale production of QDs. This method is also useful for tailoring the nano-architectures of binary, ternary as well as quaternary materials. This method is suitable for preparing high-quality sensitization at room temperature. In the present investigation, a CdS coated ZnO sample photoelectrode exhibits a 1.61% power conversion efficiency.

All the chemicals used in the experiments were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Soda lime and FTO coated glasses (10–12 Ω cm−2) were used as substrates. The seed solution was prepared in absolute ethanol with 0.05 M zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) and 0.05 M diethanolamine (HN(CH2CH2OH)2, DEA) (Sigma Aldrich, 98%). The substrate is dipped in the seed solution for 10 s and dried in air over night at room temperature. The seed coated films were annealed at 400 °C for 10 min to form a uniform ZnO seed layer on the substrate. To grow 1D ZnO nanorods, the seed coated substrate was kept in a 0.05 M zinc acetate and 0.05 M hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) (Sigma Aldrich, 99.0%) solution. The prepared solution was refluxed at 95 °C at 5 h. Finally, the refluxed film was washed with distilled water and ethanol to eliminate any residual zinc salts and carbon contamination from the precursor. Finally, the deposited ZnO photoelectrodes were air dried at room temperature.


The CdS quantum dots were synthesized as per our previous report with some modification. Briefly, the prepared ZnO nanorod electrodes were exposed to Cd2+ and S2− ions by successive immersion in an ethanolic solution of Cd(NO3)2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.0%) and methanolic solution of Na2S (Sigma Aldrich, 99.0%). The electrodes were washed with ethanol and methanol in intermediate steps. Upon the completion of 10 cycles, a yellow precipitate (CdS) was observed on the ZnO electrode. The CdS QDs sensitized ZnO sample was finally rinsed with ethanol and used for further characterizations. The possible reaction is shown below:

Eqn (1) represents the completion of one SILAR cycle. In a typical experiment, we varied the SILAR cycles from 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 and designated the CdS sensitized ZnO nanorod (CS) samples as CS10, CS15, CS20, CS25, CS30, CS35, CS40, and CS45 respectively. The deposited yellow colored samples were further used for subsequent characterizations.

The surface morphology of the prepared CdS, ZnO, and CdS–ZnO nanostructured samples were recorded by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; S-4700, Hitachi). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained by a TECNAI F20 Philips operated at 200 kV. The TEM sample was prepared by drop casting an ethanolic dispersion of the ZnO and CdS–ZnO samples onto a carbon coated Cu grid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a D/MAX Uitima III XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a Cu K line of 1.5410 Å. The elemental information regarding the deposited CdS–ZnO sample was analyzed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (VG Multilab 2000-Thermo Scientific, USA, K-Alpha) with a multi-channel detector, which can endure high photonic energies from 0.1 to 3 keV.

A compact and sealed QDSSC was fabricated using a standard two electrode configuration comprising Glass/FTO/ZnO–CdS (with an active surface area of 0.25 cm2) as the photoanode and platinum coated FTO as the counter electrode, which was sealed with the working electrode using a thermoplastic (∼1 μm). The Pt/FTO counter electrodes were prepared from commercial Pt-paste (Solaronix) using a doctor blade technique. The deposited Pt/FTO substrate was annealed at 400 °C for 30 min in air. The 0.5 M aqueous Na2S solution was used as the redox electrolyte and injected into the interelectrode space from the counter electrode side through a pre-drilled hole. The cells were illuminated using a solar simulator at AM 1.5 G for 10 s, where the light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter to 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2).


Fig. 1 shows an SEM image of the bare CdS thin film deposited by the SILAR technique. The repeating SILAR cycles were 40 (CS40). A uniform distribution of CdS nanoparticles with sizes of ∼15–20 nm covered the substrate throughout. Fig. 2(a–c) shows FESEM images of the ZnO nanorods at different magnifications. The FESEM micrograph demonstrates the vertically aligned ZnO nanorods and their uniform distribution throughout the substrate. The average diameter of the ZnO nanorod is 55–65 nm. Fig. 2(d) shows a cross-section FESEM image of the vertically grown ZnO nanorods, revealing that the nanorods have lengths of 2.1 μm. The length of the ZnO nanorods depends on the reflux time. Here, we have kept a 5 h reflux time for all the ZnO samples.


Fig. 3(a–c) shows FESEM images of the CdS sensitized ZnO nanorods at different magnifications. From the FESEM images it is clear that the CdS quantum dots are satisfactorily coated onto the ZnO surface. Furthemore, the highly magnified cross-section FESEM reveals that the ZnO nanorods become rough when covered with a number of CdS nanoparticles, demonstrating the deposition of CdS QDs onto the ZnO nanorods. The cross-sectional FESEM images reveal that the entire surface of the ZnO nanorods has been covered by CdS QDs (Fig. 3(d)). Fig. 4 show photographs of the CdS sensitized ZnO thin films at different SILAR cycles. Fig. 4(a) shows a photograph of the white coloured bare ZnO which has been deposited onto the FTO substrate. Fig. 4(b) shows a photograph of the CdS coated ZnO sample after 10 SILAR cycles. The light yellow coloured CdS has started to deposit. Fig. 4(c) and (d) show photographs of CdS deposited ZnO photoelectrodes after 30 and 40 SILAR cycles respectively. From the photographs it is clear that the light yellow colour becomes dark yellow, confirming more CdS nanoparticles have been coated onto the ZnO surface.
The crystallinity of the ZnO nanorods and CdS sensitized ZnO samples were examined by XRD measurements. Fig. 5(a) shows the XRD pattern of the bare ZnO nanorods. The observed diffraction peaks correspond to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), (201) and (004) at 31.94°, 34.59°, 36.35°, 47.75°, 56.82°, 62.93°, 98.10°, 69.24° and 72.89° respectively of the ZnO hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure (JCPDS 80-0074). The sharp and intense peak at 34.59° clearly confirms the preferred orientation along the (002) plane. The highly oriented peak at 2θ = 28.21° indicates a preferred orientation along the (002) plane of the hexagonal {P63mc(186)} phase.

Fig. 5(b) shows the XRD pattern of the CdS sensitized ZnO after 40 SILAR cycles. It is observed that the XRD pattern shows the presence of ZnO nanorods as well as CdS. The peaks originating at 26.56°, 30.74°, 44.05° and 52.11° correspond to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes respectively of the CdS cubic phase crystal structure (JCPDS: 80-0019). This result confirms the successful coating of CdS on the ZnO nanorods.
The detailed crystal structures of the ZnO and CdS–ZnO samples were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of the ZnO sample coated with and without CdS. Fig. 6(a) clearly reveals that the chemically grown ZnO nanorod sample has a diameter of about 150 nm.
The SAED pattern shows the single crystallinity of the ZnO nanorods (Fig. 6(b)). Furthermore, the highly magnified HRTEM images show the excellent crystallinity of the ZnO nanorods along the (002) direction.
The clear lattice fringe of the single nanorod sample is observed to be singly crystalline along the entire length. The interplanar spacing is obtained from the HRTEM lattice fringes along d002 = 0.26 nm between the adjacent lattice fringes (Fig. 6(c) and (d)).Fig. 6(e) shows the TEM image of the CdS coated ZnO nanorod after 40 cycles. Fig. 6(a) clearly indicates that the CdS quantum dots are reasonably uniformly attached onto the elongated ZnO nanorod. Furthermore, we have recorded its SAED pattern. Fig. 6(f) shows the SAED pattern of the CdS QDs, indicating their polycrystalline nature. The well-resolved two dimensional lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.31 nm correspond to the (111) plane of the CdS crystal (Fig. 6(g) and (h)).
The surface composition of the CdS coated ZnO sample was investigated by XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 7. The XPS survey spectrum of the CdS coated ZnO sample (Fig. 3) indicates the presence of cadmium (Cd), sulfur (S) and zinc (Zn) with carbon (C) and oxygen (O). The C peaks stem from atmospheric contamination and the initial organic precursors, like zinc acetate and 0.05 M diethanolamine, from the precursor solution. The binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis were corrected to take into account the specimen charge by referring to C 1s at 285.02 eV. Fig. 7(b) shows the high resolution scan of the Zn(2p1/2) and Zn(2p3/2) peaks for the ZnO/CdS sample. The peaks at about 1022.42 eV and 1044.48 eV confirm that the Zn exists mainly in the form of the Zn2+ chemical state on the sample surface. Fig. 7(c) shows the high resolution scan of the O 1s peak. The O 1s main peak at 531.70 eV is assigned to the metallic oxides. It can be seen that the O 1s peak is somewhat asymmetric, suggesting that there are at least two kinds of oxygen species on the sample surface. The deconvoluted fitting peak with O 1s (529.7 eV) is closely related with the oxygen lattice of ZnO. Fig. 7(d and e) shows a narrow range of scans for the Cd and S peaks of the same samples respectively. The two-peak structure in the Cd 3d core level arises from a spin–orbit interaction with the Cd(3d5/2) peak position at 404.52 eV and the Cd(3d3/2) at 411.36 eV. The XPS binding energy of S 2p is 160.98 eV, indicative of the CdS chemistry.
In order to understand the photoelctrochemical behaviour of our CdS–ZnO devices, we have used the following cell configuration
FTO/ZnO–CdS/Na2S − electrolyte/Pt/FTO
(2)

Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of a QDDSSC based on the CdS–ZnO architecture. The working principle of the CdS–ZnO photoelectrode is shown in Fig. 8. The CdS–ZnO deposited onto the FTO coated substrate acts as the working electrode while a Pt/FTO coated substrate acts as the counter electrode. The Na2S electrolyte acts as a redox couple. The detailed selection of the Na2S redox electrolyte and its (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple has been discussed elsewhere. When this core shell device is subjected to illumination, the following reaction process takes place step by step. The process of electron injection commences when a photon of energy is absorbed by the CdS in the visible region to create an electron–hole pair. This mechanism can be explained by the following equation:
(3)
It is well known that the conduction band (CB) of CdS is higher than the CB of ZnO and therefore, excited electrons are immediately transfer from the CB of CdS to the CB of ZnO. Also, the ZnO surface is very smooth and CdS QDs are deposited onto the 1D ZnO surface. Therefore, fast electron transfer takes place. The inset highly magnified TEM image shows the corresponding CdS–ZnO interface. This 1D ZnO is very beneficial for fast electron transport. Also, the 1D and highly ordered ZnO nanorods as a core can provide an effective high surface area for the CdS shell. The above mechanism can be explained by the following equations:
CdS(h+ + e−) + ZnO → CdS(h) + ZnO(e)
(4)
CdS(h) + S2− → CdS + S2˙−
(5)
The above eqn (5) can be modified in general as:
CdS(h) + R → CdS + O
(6)
where R is the reduced species (
i.e. S2−) and O is the oxidized species (that is S2˙−). Therefore, S2−/Sn2− is the redox couple for the CdS decorated ZnO sample which is provided by the Na2S electrolyte and the hole transfer to S2− competes with the charge recombination process.

This 1D architecture facilitates shorter conduction pathways for photogenerated charge transport. Finally, the electrons are collected by the FTO substrate and subsequently flow to an external circuit.

Fig. 9 shows the current voltage (J–V) properties of the CdS–ZnO electrodes under a constant illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at different SILAR cycles. The photovoltaic results are summarized in Table 1. We have also studied the stability of these devices and it is observed that these samples show good stability. In our experiments, we have observed that after 10 cycles, a CdS thin layer starts to deposit onto the ZnO sample. Therefore, we have recorded J–V after 10 SILAR cycles.

The CS10 sample shows a short circuit current density (JSC) of 1.95 mA cm−2 and the open circuit voltage (VOC) is 0.580 V with a fill factor (FF) of 0.48. The CS10 sample shows η = 0.46% power conversion efficiency (PCE). The CS15 sample shows 0.58% PCE with 2.45 mA cm−2JSC and 0.580 V VOC. The CS20 sample shows 2.68 mA cm−2JSC and 0.579 V VOC with 0.69% conversion efficiency. The PCE of CS25 and CS30 are η = 0.82% and η = 0.85% respectively. However, the CS35 (JSC = 4.35 mA cm−2) and CS40 (JSC = 5.61 mA cm−2) samples show dramatic increments in their conversion efficiency up to 1.22% and 1.61% respectively. This enhancement may be due to effective CdS loading on ZnO nanorods, helpful for light harvesting. Furthermore, when we increased the SILAR cycles from 40 to 45, the out-put characteristics of the CS45 sample shows a small decrement in JSC up to 4.45 mA cm−2 as well as a conversion efficiency of 1.19%. This may be due to over coating of CdS onto the ZnO surface, which constrains the transportation of photogenerated electrons and gives a faster recombination rate and which accounts for the reduction of electrons from CdS to the 1D ZnO nanorods.

In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a CdS coated 1D ZnO nanorod architecture by a simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and an aqueous chemical growth (ACG) technique. The 1D ZnO morphology is very useful due to the fast electron transfer through 1D nanostructures, effective high surface area via the vertical arrangement and the very smooth surface to the CdS quantum dots. A promising photocurrent density of 5.61 mA cm−2 with η = 1.61% has been achieved for the 40 SILAR cycles sample under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. This CdS sensitized 1D ZnO nanorod architecture provides a promising approach for quantum dot sensitized solar cells.
