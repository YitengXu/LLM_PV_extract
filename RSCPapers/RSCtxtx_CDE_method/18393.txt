Three new conjugated polymers based on 5-decylthiazol-2-yl substituted benzodithiophene have been synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization. 1,3-Dibromo-5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (M1), 2,5-diethylhexyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (M2) and 4,6-dibromo-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-dodecyl carboxylate (M3) were used as acceptor building blocks for the synthesis of conjugated donor–acceptor polymers. The thermal, optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties of the synthesized polymers were studied.

In bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells, benzodithiophene (BDT) based copolymers are among the most frequently used donor materials. There are several reasons for the extensive use and rapid development of BDT based copolymers in BHJ polymer solar cells. First, starting from 4,8-dihydrobenzene[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione, it is very easy to attach different substituents to the central benzene core by nucleophilic addition thus fine-tuning the solubility and energy levels of the polymers. Second, the BDT core has structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic system which could enhance the electron delocalization and also the large planar conjugated structure facilitates π–π stacking which is good for improving mobility. Third, steric hindrance between two adjacent units in the polymer chain affects highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels dramatically. For BDT based polymers, the steric hindrance is small leading to coplanar polymer chain structures lowering the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Finally, the BDT unit is a relatively weak electron donor and resulting polymers have a HOMO energy level that gives desirable open circuit voltage (Voc) in BHJ solar cells in combination with fullerene electron acceptors.

The BDT polymers were first reported in 2002 and were used in organic field effect transistors exhibiting a high hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1. Hou and Yang et al. introduced the BDT polymers to BHJ polymer solar cells in 2008. Since then, there have been numerous examples of conjugated polymers containing the BDT unit. Some successful examples include coupling of the 2-ethylhexyl substituted BDT unit with 4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene carboxylate giving a donor material that showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.74%; replacing the 2-ethylhexyloxy group with a 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thienyl group increasing the PCE from 6.43% to 7.59%; and coupling of the 2-ethylhexyl substituted BDT unit with 5-dibutyloctyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione gave a low HOMO–LUMO energy gap polymer (1.44 eV) which was applied to a tandem solar cell yielding a PCE of 8.62%. To date, up to 9.2% PCE was obtained in single layer BHJ solar cells with the BDT based copolymers.
Thiazole is a widely used electron-accepting heterocyclic compound because of its electron-withdrawing nitrogen on the imine (CN) bond. In organic electronics, thiazole based small molecules and conjugated polymers have been explored for a long time. Thiazolyl monomers have also been copolymerized with BDT monomers. Li and Zhan studied several copolymers of alkoxy substituted BDT monomers and bithiazolyl monomers. PBDTBTBTz, based on the bithiazole acceptor unit and the BDT donor unit reached 4.46% PCE in polymer solar cells. Copolymers of thiazolothiazole and thienyl substituted BDT monomers were also investigated. However, in all these cases, thiazoles are in the main chain of the copolymers. Theoretical calculation indicated that changing the position of the thiazolyl unit from the main chain to the side chain could also provide polymers with low HOMO energy level and low band gap.
In this work, we designed a 5-decylthiazol-2-yl substituted BDT monomer and synthesized three new conjugated polymers. The thiazole moiety has two main attractive features. Firstly, a long alkyl chain can be easily attached to the thiazole ring. This enhances the solubility and processability of resulting polymers particularly higher molecular weight materials. Secondly, the conjugated 5-decylthiazol-2-yl substituent was expected to exert substantial influence on the optoelectronic properties of the polymer backbone. The electron deficient nature of the thiazole unit should cause a shift in the HOMO energy level of the polymers to lower values. With lower HOMO energy, higher values for the Voc of BHJ devices were predicted if the polymers were used in combination with fullerene acceptors, such as phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). BHJ solar cell devices with high Voc are attractive from the efficiency as well as from the point of view of application.

The synthetic route for preparing the thiazolyl substituted BDT monomer is shown in Scheme 1. Dodecyl aldehyde was first treated with sulfuryl chloride and thiourea to give 5-decylthiazol-2-amine (1) in 42% yield. 5-Decylthiazol-2-amine (1) was then brominated using the Sandmeyer reaction in 58% yield. Direct lithiation of 2-bromo-5-decylthiazole (2) gave a dimeric by-product which was not easy to purify. Instead 2-bromo-5-decylthiazole (2) was debrominated with zinc metal and acetic acid to give 5-decylthiazole (3) in quantitative yield. After deprotonation with butyl lithium, compound 3 was reacted with 4,8-dihydrobenzene[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione and then reduced with tin(II) chloride to give BDT compound 4 in 47% yield. 4,8-Bis(5-decylthiazol-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (4) was converted into bistrimethylstannyl derivative 5 with n-butyl lithium and then trimethyltin chloride in 40% yield. Purification of compound 5 was achieved by recrystallization from dichloromethane and isopropanol.

Polymers P1–P3 were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), Pd(PPh3)4, as the catalyst (Scheme 2). Three well studied monomers, 1,3-dibromo-5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (M1), 2,5-diethylhexyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (M2) and 4,6-dibromo-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-dodecyl carboxylate (M3) were used as acceptor building blocks for the synthesis of donor–acceptor polymers (Scheme 2). The crude polymers were precipitated in methanol and were collected by filtration. After washing with methanol, petroleum spirits and dichloromethane, the high molecular weight (MW) fraction of the polymer was extracted with chloroform. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure provided polymers P1, P2 and P3 as dark purple, dark green and dark blue solids, respectively. The yields of the chloroform fraction of P1–P3 are summarized in Table 1. Polymers P1–P3 were soluble in chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, but not soluble in acetone, toluene, hexane or acetonitrile. The molecular weight and polydispersity (PDI) of the polymers were determined using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in chloroform calibrated against polystyrene standards (Table 1). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P1, P2 and P3 were 26.3, 17.3 and 25.7 kDa, respectively.

Thermal properties of the polymers were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (ESI, Fig. S1 and S2). All polymers exhibited good thermal stability as observed from the TGA analysis (Table 1). The decomposition temperatures of P1, P2 and P3 determined at 5% weight loss were 376, 377 and 380 °C, respectively. No significant thermal transitions were observed in DSC analysis in the range of 40 to 300 °C.


The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform are shown in Fig. 1a. All polymers exhibited two main absorption peaks, one at 350–400 nm, which could be assigned to localized π–π* transitions, and the other, broader band in the long wavelength region, is corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the acceptor units and the donor BDT units in the main chain. Polymer P1 showed the shortest absorption maximum (λmax) locating at 556 nm, indicating a limited ability for ICT, while polymers P2 and P3 showed much red-shifted λmax at 759 nm and 756 nm, respectively. Compared with the thienyl substituted BDT polymers with the same acceptor units, P1 and P2 displayed slightly blue shifted λmax, while P3 showed largely red shifted λmax (692 nm for thienyl substituted BDT polymers as reported in the literature). The λmax of the polymer films slightly red-shifted (2, 4 and 13 nm for P1, P2 and P3, respectively) compared with that of chloroform solution, indicating that the polymers have a rigid-rod confirmation in both solution and solid state (Fig. 1b). A significant feature of the absorption spectra of the films versus the chloroform solutions is the broadening of the absorption bands and the increase in the intensity of the shoulder peaks especially for P2 which could be due to the enhanced intermolecular electronic interactions in the solid state.

Strong fluorescence emission was observed only for polymer P1 (Table 2). Solution emission maxima of 659 nm and slightly red-shifted thin film emission maxima of 667 nm were recorded. Polymers P2 and P3 showed weak fluorescence emission in solution at 810 and 821 nm, respectively. No fluorescence response was detected for the thin film samples.

The optical band gaps obtained by extrapolating the absorption edges of the film absorption were 1.81, 1.40 and 1.39 eV for P1, P2 and P3, respectively (Table 2). The energy levels of the polymers were first examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Table 2 and ESI, Fig. S3). According to the CV results, the HOMO energy level of P1 was −5.65 eV which is lower than its thienyl substituted BDT polymer analogue (−5.47 eV). Polymers P2 and P3 showed higher HOMO energy levels of −5.18 and −5.09 eV, respectively (the HOMO energy levels of the thienyl substituted BDT polymer analogues of P2 and P3 were −5.30 and −5.09 eV, respectively). Since the CV measurements suffered from film delamination and low response issues, we conducted photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) measurements which can provide an intrinsic alternative to cyclic voltammetry in determining the HOMO energy level of polymer films in an ambient environment. According to PESA results, the HOMO energy levels of P1, P2 and P3 were −5.51, −4.96 and −4.59 eV respectively, which were all higher than the CV results. The differences of the measured HOMO energy level between the two techniques have been attributed to the completely different experiment techniques and the fact that CV onset potentials were determined from the intersection of the two tangents drawn at the rising current and base line charging current of the CV traces. However, the trends were the same; P1 displayed the lowest HOMO energy level and P3 displayed the highest.

In order to further investigate the impact of thiazolyl side chain on the optoelectronic properties of copolymers, theoretical calculations were also carried out to reveal the HOMO energy levels by using DFT (Fig. 2 and ESI, Fig. S5). The DFT simulation was performed with B3LYP/6-31G level using Gaussian 09. To reduce the computation time, methyl groups were used to replace the long alkyl groups for calculations. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the respective frontier orbitals with six repeating units as models are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S5. Polymer P1 displayed a much low-lying calculated HOMO energy level of −5.32 eV compared with the calculated HOMO energy level of polymers P2 and P3, −4.85 eV and −4.82 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the tendency of CV and PESA results. It should be noted that for a common donor–acceptor polymer, the HOMO wave function is usually delocalized through the entire polymer backbone while the LUMO wave function is well-localized. As observed from the calculated frontier orbitals, P1, P2 and P3 were unusual due to the electron-withdrawing property of thiazolyl substituents. For polymers P1 and P3, the electron transfer from the BDT unit to the thieno[3,4-c] pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) units was found. For polymer P2, the BDT unit is more likely to serve as an electron acceptor and electron transfer from the thiophene unit to the BDT unit was observed (Fig. 2 and ESI, Fig. S5).

As proposed by Yu and other groups, the change of the dipole moment from the ground state to the excited state (Δμge) of the conjugated polymers affected the efficiency of the corresponding polymer based solar cells dramatically. A larger Δμge value was thought to be good for lowering the Coulombic binding energy of excitons and facilitating charge separation. We also conducted dipole moment calculation for polymers P1–P3 with one repeating unit as a model system (Tables 3 and S1). Polymers P2 and P3 have larger Δμge, 2.27 debye for the P2 unit and 2.43 debye for the P3 unit, than that of the P1 unit (0.35 debye). The larger Δμge values of P2 and P3 could weaken the exciton binding energy and promote the formation of the charge-separated state.

The photovoltaic properties of the three new polymers were investigated in BHJ solar cell devices. A schematic diagram of the solar cells with conventional device architecture [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ZnO/Al] is shown in Fig. 3a. o-Dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was chosen as the processing solvent due to its good solvent properties and low evaporation rates. The weight ratios of copolymers and PC71BM were varied to balance the absorbance and the charge transporting network of the photoactive layer. The absorption spectra of the active layer of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 3c. Common optimization parameters such as spin rate (film thickness) and annealing were also investigated (ESI, Table S2). The devices were studied under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The current–voltage curves of the polymer/PC71BM devices are displayed in Fig. 3b and the photovoltaic performance is listed in Table 4.

The P1:PC71BM (1:2) device showed the lowest performance in all three polymers with an Voc of 0.82 V, a fill factor (FF) of 32%, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.05 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.27%. Thermal annealing was found to be detrimental to the device performance (Table 4). The device with P2 polymer exhibits a much higher Jsc of 7.60 mA cm−2 and a higher FF of 49% due to the broader absorption and the improved morphology of the active layer as evidenced from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) study (Fig. 4). However, the Voc is quite low, only 0.44 V which could be attributed to the high-lying HOMO energy level of P2. The overall PCE for the P2:PC71BM (1:2) device was 1.63%. To attempt further optimization of the photovoltaic performance of polymer P2 and to exclude the possible protonation of the thiazolyl nitrogen atom on the surface of PEDOT:PSS, an inverted device with the geometry [ITO/ZnO/P2:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag] was made and tested. The inverted device gave a PCE of 1.50% with a Jsc of 8.80 mA cm−2, a FF of 39% and a similar Voc of 0.44 V. The similar Voc of the conventional and inverted solar cells suggested that the low Voc is not caused by the protonation of the thiazolyl group. The devices based on P3:PC71BM (1:2) displayed a Voc of 0.44 V, a Jsc of 9.50 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.44, yielding a PCE of 2.3%. Solvent additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) was tested in the P3:PC71BM device. However, the device performance decreased (see ESI, Table S3). The decrease could be due to the preferential interaction of DIO with the insulating alkyl substituents of the benzodithiophene repeat unit which affects the morphology of the blends. The measured Voc values varied between 0.44 and 0.48 V, which also represent a relatively good agreement with the theoretically predicted HOMO energy levels of the donor polymer and LUMO of the PC71BM acceptor.
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the solar cell devices were also studied. Fig. S9 shows the EQE curves of the solar cells fabricated under the same optimized conditions as those used for the J–V measurements. Obviously, the EQE values for P2 and P3 are all higher than those of P1 based solar cells, which agree with the higher Jsc values of the devices derived from P2 and P3. The Jsc values were also calculated by integrating the EQE data with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum. The Jsc values obtained using integration and J–V measurements are rather close. The calculated Jsc values of the device based on P1, P2 and P3 were 2.0, 8.7 and 9.3 mA cm−2, respectively, which are close to the values obtained from the J–V curves. The hole mobilities of the blends of the polymers and PC71BM were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method and the results are listed in Table 4. The higher hole mobilities of P2 and P3 could contribute to the high Jsc of the P2 and P3 based solar cells which were also consistent with the EQE measurement.
The morphology of the active layers was investigated using tapping mode AFM. The AFM images of P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM and P3:PC71BM blends are shown in Fig. 4. Compared to the active layer of P1:PC71BM which gave low Jsc and low FF, P2:PC71BM and P3:PC71BM active layers displayed smoother surface morphology (for P1:PC71BM blend, rms = 2.6 nm; for P2:PC71BM blend, rms = 1.4 nm; for P3:PC71BM blend, rms = 1.2 nm) and smaller domain sizes. This result is consistent with previous reports in which smoother blend films displayed better performance in bulk heterojunction solar cells. AFM analysis was also performed for P2:PC71BM blend on the ZnO surface which was employed in the inverted structure (see ESI, Fig. S6). Phase separation between the donor polymer and the PC71BM acceptor was also evident and the morphology did not change much compared to that on PEDOT:PSS surface. The morphology of the blend film after addition of DIO was then tested (see ESI, Fig. S7). A comparison of the AFM images of P3:PC71BM blend with or without DIO indicates that the film obtained with DIO additive has a rougher surface morphology (rms = 1.5 nm) and larger domain sizes, which could explain the decrease of the FF and the PCE of the device.

Three new donor–acceptor type π conjugated polymers containing the 5-decylthiazol-2-yl substituted BDT unit were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization. The polymers exhibited high thermal stability and good solubility in chlorinated solvent. Polymers P2 and P3 showed broad absorption in the range of 300–850 nm while P1 only absorbed light from 300 to 650 nm. Polymer P1 displayed a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.51 V while P2 and P3 had unexpected high-lying HOMO energy level of −4.96 V and −4.59 V, respectively, as determined by PESA experiments. BHJ polymer solar cells were fabricated with the blends of P1–P3:PC71BM as the active layer. P1 based solar cells exhibited high Voc but Jsc was too low. The low Jsc was attributed to the limited absorption and unfavoured morphology which leads to low mobility and low EQE. In contrast, P2 and P3 displayed high Jsc and low Voc. A PCE of 2.3% was achieved when P3:PC71BM (1:2) blend was used as the active layer with a Voc of 0.44 V, a Jsc of 9.50 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.44. The low Voc values of P2 and P3 based solar cells were attributed to the high-lying HOMO as revealed by PESA studies. The results of this study provide information on the thiazolyl side chain and its influence on optoelectronic properties of the polymer. It is interesting to find that the thiazolyl substituted BDT polymers show higher lying HOMO energy levels than thienyl BDT polymers. This resulted in low Voc for P2 and P3 based BHJ solar cells. Literature reports have shown that replacing the 2-ethylhexyloxy group with the 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thienyl group of the BDT polymer increased PCE from 6.43% to 7.59%. However, the bithienyl substituted BDT polymers gave a PCE of 1.33% which was lower than the corresponding 2-ethylhexyloxy group substituted BDT polymers. Alkyl chains and molecular weight of polymers were also found to affect the solar cell performance drastically. This study illustrates that small changes in the molecular structure can have profound influence on material properties and device performance. Careful design of organic electronic materials requires a combination of existing knowledge and theoretical predictions to maximise the potential for new materials to succeed.


Unless noted, all materials were of reagent grade and used as received without further purification. Compounds M1,M2, and M3 have been reported in the literature. All the other starting compounds and reagents are commercially available. Experimental methods and instruments and detailed characterisation and fabrication of the BHJ polymer solar cells can be found in the ESI.

Bis(trimethyltin) compound 6 (0.1 mmol) and the dibromo or diiodo monomer (0.1 mmol) were mixed in 5 mL of toluene and 1 mL of DMF. After being purged with nitrogen for 5 min, [Pd(PPh3)4] (5 mg) was added as the catalyst, and the mixture was then purged with nitrogen for 10 min. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to reflux for 2 days. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by addition of 50 mL methanol, and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble. The precipitate was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexanes, dichloromethane and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as solid from the chloroform fraction by precipitation from methanol. The solid was dried under vacuum.
