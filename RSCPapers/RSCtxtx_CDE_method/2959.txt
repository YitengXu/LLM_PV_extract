Ternary solar cells have been proven to be an effective way to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Up to now, research effort has mostly focused on fullerene derivatives and acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptor-based ternary solar cells, while perylene diimide (PDI)-based ternary devices have been rarely studied. In this contribution, we introduced a new type of ternary solar cell based on a PDI-based small-molecule acceptor (PBI-Por) and a polymer donor (PTB7-Th) with a third PDI-based polymer acceptor (PDI-V). The introduction of PDI-V into the ternary blends not only broadens the absorption of blend films but also increases the electron mobilities. As a result, a high efficiency of 9.43% was obtained for the ternary OSC, which is 20% higher than that of the binary OSC. Detailed studies indicate that PDI-V showed good compatibility with PBI-Por in the blend films, which demonstrates a promising way to fabricate high-performance PDI-based OSCs.

Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention due to their light weight, mechanical flexibility and solution processability. Up to now, impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 13% have been achieved for both single and tandem solar cells. However, due to the narrow optical absorption spectrum of organic materials, light will not be completely absorbed by solar cells. To address this issue, tandem organic solar cells were developed to allow cells to absorb light over a wide optical spectrum. Nevertheless, tandem solar cells face many challenges due to their complex fabrication process and high cost, which limits their practical applications. Recently, ternary organic solar cells comprising two donors and one acceptor or one donor and two acceptors have been proved to be an efficient strategy to broaden the absorption spectrum and thus increase the device efficiency. In addition, compared with tandem solar cells with complex fabrication processes, ternary solar cells are easily fabricated with only one processing step. As a result, ternary OSCs have been extensively investigated as a competitive candidate to further enhance the PCEs of OSCs.

The working mechanism of ternary solar cells is complicated due to the distinct electronic, optical and thermodynamic properties of three components. For example, Yu et al. added a polymer donor, PID2, into a PTB7:PC71BM binary system to fabricate ternary devices and achieved a PCE of 9.2% due to the efficient energy transfer between PID2 and PTB7. Recently, our group has reported that when combining ITIC-Th with PDBT-T1 and PC71BM as a ternary blend, ITIC-Th and PC71BM generated separated charge transport channels, resulting in photocurrent contribution from both acceptors. Therefore, the ternary solar cells showed improved Jsc without sacrificing the Voc and FF due to the contribution of the longer-wavelength absorption of ITIC-Th. In addition, Hou et al. have reported ternary devices based on two ITIC analogues (ITIC-M and IEICO) and a polymer donor (J52). Due to the good miscible properties and complementary absorption, a broader absorption and compatible morphology were obtained, leading to an improved performance in ternary solar cells. All these results reveal that ternary solar cells are able to significantly enhance the PCE compared to binary solar cells. Nowadays, PCEs of over 13% have been realized for ternary devices. However, we noticed that research effort was mostly focused on fullerene derivatives and acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptor-based ternary solar cells. Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have been regarded as promising acceptor materials with the highest PCE exceeding 10%. Besides, there are some attractive features for PDI derivatives such as high electron mobility, strong absorption ability, and high thermostability and photostability. However, PDI-based ternary solar cells have rarely been investigated.
In this contribution, we fabricated a new type of high-performance ternary solar cell based on a polymer donor, PTB7-Th (or PCE-10), and a star-shaped PDI-based small-molecule acceptor (PBI-Por) with a third PDI-based polymer acceptor (PDI-V). PBI-Por and PDI-V are two efficient PDI-based electron acceptors, which have complementary light absorption. Due to the similar lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBI-Por and PDI-V, the Voc of ternary devices is similar to that of binary devices. In addition, the two PDI-based acceptors showed better compatibility in the blend films. When adding PDI-V into the binary blend, the PDI-V would not disturb the favorable morphology of the host blend. More importantly, the introduction of PDI-V was beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport due to the efficient charge transfer from the PBI-Por to PDI-V. Consequently, the optimal ternary OSC exhibits a high efficiency of 9.43%, which is 20% higher than that of the binary OSC. Such a high efficiency results from the increased Jsc and FF. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for fabrication of highly efficient PDI-based ternary solar cells.

The chemical structures of PTB7-Th, PBI-Por and PDI-V are presented in Fig. 1a. The absorption spectra in film and solution of these three materials are presented in Fig. 1b and S1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, the maximum absorption peak of PTB7-Th is at 707 nm. For PBI-Por, the maximum absorption peaks appear at 465 nm and 795 nm, arising from the absorption from the PDI and Por units, respectively. As for PDI-V, the maximum absorption peak appears at 610 nm. The complementary absorption of the three materials should be beneficial for the light harvesting ability, resulting in high Jsc in the ternary devices.

The energy level diagrams of PTB7-Th, PBI-Por and PDI-V are displayed in Fig. 1c. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of PTB7-Th, PBI-Por and PDI-V are −5.43 eV, −5.69 eV, and −5.99 eV, respectively. And the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PTB7-Th, PBI-Por and PDI-V are −3.59 eV, −3.86 eV and −3.87 eV, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms of the three materials are shown in Fig. S2. To further measure the ionization potential (IP) of three materials, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed (Fig. S3). The IP of PTB7-Th, PBI-Por and PDI-V is calculated to be 5.33, 5.80 and 6.16 eV, respectively. These results agree well with the cyclic voltammogram results. The energy levels of the PDI-V are lower than those of PBI-Por, and cascade charge transfer is possible.
The device performance of binary or ternary solar cells with different weight ratios of two acceptors is systematically studied. The solar cells were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the PBI-Por-based binary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 7.8% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 V and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.51 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 62.4%. The PDI-V based binary OSCs show a PCE of 7.14% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 14.72 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.2%. The champion PCE of the ternary solar cell is 9.43% when the content of PDI-V is 20% in the binary PTB7-Th:PBI-Por system, which is 20% higher than that of the binary control devices. To have a better understanding about the increased FF, the shunt resistance (RSH) and series resistance (RS) of devices were also calculated. As listed in Table S1, when adding 20% PDI-V, the RS decreased to 2.9 Ω cm2 and the RSH increased to 709.2 Ω cm2. The low RS and high RSH are beneficial to charge carrier transport, leading to an enhanced FF. Meanwhile, the broadened absorption spectrum and more efficient charge transport greatly contributed to the enhancement of PCE, which will be discussed in detail in the following section.

As shown in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2b), when the amount of PDI-V increases, the EQE signal is enhanced in the region of 550–720 nm but suppressed at 400–550 nm. It is suggested that the light absorption of the two acceptors contributes to the Jsc enhancement of OSCs. Notably, the highest EQE value (75.1% at 660 nm) is achieved when the amount of PDI-V is 20% with a broad response over a whole range of wavelengths. The integral current density values calculated from the EQE curves of PTB7-Th:PBI-Por with different PDI-V contents are in agreement with the experimental Jscs from the J–V measurements.
The charge mobility of binary and ternary blends with different PDI-V contents was investigated by using the electron-only (ITO/ZnO/active layers/ZrAcac/Al) devices and hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag) devices (Fig. S4). The data of space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3, compared with the PBI-Por (1.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the PDI-V shows a higher electron mobility (5.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, the electron mobility of devices increase almost linearly with the increase of the contents of PDI-V. Interestingly, the hole mobility is also enhanced when the contents of PDI-V increase from 0% to 20%, which is similar to that reported for other ternary devices. Moreover, we studied the charge recombination kinetics in these devices by measuring Jsc as a function of light intensity (Plight). Quantitatively, Jsc shows a power-law dependence on Plight for OSCs (Jsc ∝ Plightα), where the α value is the exponential factor. It is suggested that a negligible bimolecular recombination would exist when α is close to 1.. As shown in Fig. 3c, the α value of the PBI-Por-based binary device is 0.955. When adding 20% PDI-V to the blend, the α value is 0.969, indicating that the introduction of PDI-V could suppress bimolecular recombination in the ternary devices to some extent. As a result, a better FF can be obtained in the ternary devices.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and the time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRTPL) spectra were measured to further understand the working mechanism in these ternary solar cells. As shown in Fig. 3d, the PL spectrum of the PBI-Por film excited at 795 nm shows maximum emission at 862 nm, and that of PDI-V excited at 612 nm presents maximum emission at 715 nm. When mixing the PDI-V with PBI-Por, the PL emission intensity of PBI-Por decreased. These results indicate that the energy transfer may not occur between PBI-Por and PDI-V. What is more, TRTPL spectra of PBI-Por, PDI-V and PBI-Por:PDI-V films were measured to judge if there was any charge transfer between PBI-Por and PDI-V. As presented in Fig. 3e, the emission lifetime of PBI-Por:PDI-V (23.03 ps) is much shorter than that of PBI-Por (142.39 ps) and PDI-V (87.22 ps). Combined with the results of cascade energy levels of the two acceptors, it is suggested that effective charge transfer may occur between PBI-Por and PDI-V. Furthermore, the PL quenching effect in binary and ternary devices was investigated. As displayed in Fig. S5, the PL spectrum of PTB7-Th (excited at 707 nm) was quenched when blended with PBI-Por and further quenched by introducing the PDI-V into the PTB7-Th:PBI-Por binary film. What is more, compared with the emission lifetime of PTB7-Th:PBI-Por (27.34 ps) and PTB7-Th:PDI-V (28.05 ps) binary devices, the lifetime of the ternary device at the optimum ratio is much shorter (24.76 ps). This indicates that efficient charge transfer in the ternary blend also provides us a better understanding of the higher FF obtained in the ternary device.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to investigate the influence of PDI-V addition on the molecular orientation and packing structures of binary and ternary films. As shown in Fig. 4, all the blend films show a strong (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction and a hump-shaped lamellar scattering, indicating a face-on dominant mixed orientation. Compared with the PTB7-Th:PBI-Por binary film, ternary films with 10–30% PDI-V contents show similar molecular ordering, as evidenced by the comparable (100) and (010) diffraction peak positions and intensity (Table S2). These results indicate that the introduction of PDI-V may not disturb significantly the favorable morphology of the binary film.
The influence of incorporation of PDI-V on the surface morphology of the blend films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5, the surface of the PTB7-Th:PBI-Por blend is smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.10 nm, while the film of PTB7-Th:PDI-V presents a rougher surface with a RMS roughness of 1.55 nm. Besides, the RMS roughness increased from 1.10 nm to 1.20 nm gradually with the increase of PDI-V from 0% to 20%. Despite the enhanced RMS roughness of ternary films, all ternary films show a uniform surface. Besides, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also used to further investigate the bulk morphology. As shown in the TEM images (Fig. 5), after adding 10% and 20% of PDI-V, the ternary blend films still show an appropriate domain size with better phase separation.
To evaluate the miscibility between PBI-Por and PDI-V, contact angle measurements were further implemented. According to a previous report, qualitatively, the surface energy is a credible predictor of miscibility in blends. The contact angles were measured on the three neat films by using two different solvents (water and glycerol), and the surface tensions (γ) can be calculated using the Wu model.. As shown in Fig. S6 and Table 3, three materials exhibit similar surface energy: PTB7-Th (23.2 mN m−1), PBI-Por (26.6 mN m−1) and PDI-V (24.9 mN m−1). The similar surface energy may suggest the good miscibility of three materials.

In conclusion, we fabricated a novel ternary solar cell containing two PDI-based acceptors and a polymer donor, PTB7-Th. The energy cascade structures of three materials and the results of PL and TRTPL measurements demonstrate that effective charge transfer occurs in these two PDI acceptors. The addition of the PDI-V to the PTB7-Th:PBI-Por blend film did not disturb the favorable morphology of the binary film (because of its good miscibility with PBI-Por), with efficient charge transfer from PBI-Por to PDI-V. And the complementary light absorption of these three materials contributed to a high Jsc in the ternary devices. As a result, a high PCE of 9.43% was obtained, which is 20% higher than that of the binary device (7.87%). Our work shows an efficient strategy for the fabrication of high-performance PDI-based ternary solar cells.


PTB7-Th was purchased from 1-Material. All materials are used as received without modification.


All solar cell devices were fabricated using an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication using soap water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for at least 15 min, and dried in an oven at 100 °C overnight. Before use, the glass substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 1 min. The ZnO precursor (zinc acetate dihydrate) was spin-coated on top of ITO at 4000 rpm min−1 for 20 s. The substrates were annealed at 200 °C for 15 min. And then, the substrates were transferred to a N2 protected glovebox. The active layers were formed from a chlorobenzene solution containing a binary blend of PTB7-Th and PBI-Por or PDI-V, or a ternary blend of PTB7-Th:PBI-Por:PDI-V with different ratios. The overall donor:acceptor ratio was kept at 1:1 in this study. After spin-coating, the blend films were transferred into a vacuum chamber. MoO3 (3 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were thermally deposited on the top of the active layers through a shadow mask at a pressure of 1 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of devices is 4 mm2.


Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit using an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, SS-F5-3A) with an irradiation light intensity of 100 mw cm−2. EQE spectra were recorded by using a solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on a computer-controlled CHI-660E electrochemical workstation in a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt button, 2 mm in diameter, as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. Reductive CV of three materials were carried out in CHCl3 containing tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte. The energy levels were calibrated to be 0.45 V vs. the Ag/AgCl electrode in the CHCl3 solution. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectra were taken with a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. The hole and electron mobility was obtained using the SCLC method with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/ZrAcac/Al, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were fitted using J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μ is the charge mobility and L is the thickness of the active layer. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a spectrometer (DU420A-OE, ANDOR). Fluorescence decay dynamics were recorded using a TCSPC (Becker & Hickl, SPC-150). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded on a Dimension Icon AFM (Bruker) in a tapping mode. TEM images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope. GIWAXS measurements were accomplished at the PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. The contact angle was analyzed on a contact angle meter (POWEREACH JC2000D3M). The contact angle tests were carried out at 25 °C. The average values of the contact angle are from 5 droplets (each droplet is about 3 μL).
