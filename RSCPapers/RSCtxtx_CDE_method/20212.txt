A new naphthodifuran (NDF) building block has been designed and synthesized. The distinguishing feature of the monomer is two dialkyl substituted thieno groups which are placed in the middle of the ring-fused structure as solubilizing groups. The steric interactions between repeating units in the polymer can be reduced by placing the solubilising groups in the middle of the ring-fused structure. Those dialkyl substituted thieno groups not only improved the solubility of the polymer but also provided additional conjugation in the second dimension. The new monomer (NDFT) was applied to the synthesis of the conjugated polymer (PNDFT-DTBT). The photovoltaic properties of the polymer were evaluated in bulk hetero-junction polymer solar cell devices with PC61BM as acceptors under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The device showed an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.21 mA cm−2, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.22%.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their potential application as a low-cost and sustainable energy source. Conjugated polymers which combine optoelectronic properties of semiconductors with processing advantages of polymers act as a key component in the process of converting light into electricity. The optical and electronic characteristics of conjugated polymers are primarily governed by the polymer structures and inter-molecular interactions. During the past decade, many conjugated polymers have been synthesized and studied as donor materials in bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) PSC devices. The design rules for donor polymers in fullerene based BHJ devices have also been formulated.

Design and synthesis of new monomers may lead to polymers with tailor-made photo-physical and semiconducting properties for high performance solar cell applications. Recently, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) and naphthodithiophene (NDT) based conjugated polymers showed relatively high photovoltaic performances in PSC devices. One of the common structural features of these promising monomers is two heteroaromatic units fused with benzene or naphthalene to give extended π-conjugation and rigid planarity. The other common structural feature of the monomers is tactfully placing the required large solubilizing side-chains, such as alkoxy, alkyl and aryl in the middle of the ring-fused monomers to reduce the steric interaction between the consecutive repeating units in polymers. The rigid planar structure is good for extended π-conjugation and intermolecular packing. However, it usually results in poor solubility in materials. The good solubility of the polymer is essential for solution processing. To improve polymer solubility, large solubilizing groups have to be attached on the backbone of polymers. However, the side chains on the polymer backbone can result in steric interaction between adjacent repeating units. Placing large side-chains in the middle of the rigidified aromatic structure can reduce the steric hindrance between consecutive repeating units, therefore, reducing dihedral angles and achieving better conjugation in the polymer.
Recently, naphthodifurans (NDFs) as building blocks for small molecules and for polymers have been reported. Conjugated polymers based on alkyl substituted (β to the heteroatom) NDF were also reported. Herein, we report a new method for synthesis of a different NDF building block with solubilizing groups placed in the middle of the ring-fused structure to reduce steric interaction between adjacent repeating units. A polymer based on this new NDF building block has also been synthesized. The solar cell devices based on the polymer as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.22% without using any processing additives or post-fabrication treatment. This is the highest performance in solar cell devices among all polymers based on NDF building blocks.

All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Unless stated otherwise, chemicals were purchased from Adamas Reagent or Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Reagent grade anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly distilled over sodium wire and benzophenone under nitrogen prior to use. Toluene was distilled over calcium hydride under nitrogen prior to use. 4,7-Bis(5-bromo-4-hexyl-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (bis-5-bromo-DTBT) was prepared according to the literature.


Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Mercury plus 400 MHz instrument. MALDI-TOF and EI Mass Spectrometer were implemented for mass measurement. Elemental analyses were performed on an elemental analyzer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu SIL-20A liquid chromatography instrument using tetrahydrofuran as eluent with polystyrenes as standard. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a TA instrument Q5000IR at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen gas flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies were carried out with a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 under nitrogen flow. The samples (about 5.0 mg in weight) were first heated up to 300 °C and were held for 2 min to remove thermal history, followed by cooling at a rate of 10 °C min−1 to 20 °C and then heating at a rate of 10 °C min−1 to 300 °C. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted on a CHI 600 electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell under a nitrogen atmosphere in a deoxygenated anhydrous acetonitrile solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A platinum disk electrode was used as a working electrode, a platinum wire was used as a counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode was used as a reference electrode. The polymer films were coated on the surface of the platinum disk electrode. The CV curves were calibrated with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard which was measured under the same conditions before and after the measurement of samples. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the active layer was obtained using a MultiMode V microscope.


PSCs with device structures of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated as follows: a ca. 40 nm zinc oxide was obtained by spin-coating sol–gel zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor solution onto the pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The coated substrates were baked at 150 °C for 40 min in air and transferred into a nitrogen filled glove box. A chlorobenzene solution of polymer (10 mg mL−1) and PC61BM at different weight ratios with or without 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was spin coated on top of the zinc oxide layer. The samples were transferred into an evaporator and a MoO3 layer (7 nm) and an Ag layer (80 nm) were thermally deposited under a vacuum of 10−6 Torr. The device area was restricted to 8.2 mm2 by a shadow mask. The PCEs were measured in a glove box directly after fabrication. The devices for the EQE measurements were encapsulated in the glove box and measured in air. A Newport 94023A solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5G filter was used to generate a simulated AM 1.5G solar spectrum irradiation source. The irradiation intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a Newport standard silicon solar cell 91150. A Newport monochromator 74125 and a power meter 1918 with a silicon detector 918D were used in EQE measurements.

The synthesis of ring-fused naphthodifuran is shown in Scheme 1 and the experimental details are included in the ESI. The commercially available 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene was reacted with bromoacetaldehyde diethyl acetal to give 1,5-bis(2,2-diethoxyethoxy)naphthalene (1) in 68% yield.

Compound 1 was brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to give 1,5-dibromo-4,8-bis(2,2-diethoxyethoxy)naphthalene (2) in 79% yield. The cyclization of 2 was carried in a chlorobenzene (CB) solution of polyphosphoric acid (PPA) to give 5,10-dibromonaphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (3) in 67% yield. Compound 3 was only slightly soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform and toluene. The structures of 2 and 3 can be confirmed by 1H NMR spectra. The product of the bromination step showed two doublets with a coupling constant of 8.5 Hz in the aromatic region. This indicated that two different kinds of protons existed and they were in an ortho-relationship. Both structure 2 and 2′ in Scheme 1 can satisfy this requirement. The product of the ring formation step showed one singlet and two doublets with a coupling constant of 1.9 Hz in the aromatic region. This coupling constant is typical for the coupling of α and β protons on furan rings. If 2′ was formed in the bromination step and then 3′ was formed in the ring formation step, product 3′ would show two doublets with a coupling constant of about 10 Hz on its 1H NMR spectrum. So, the reaction pathways of 2′ and 3′ can be eliminated based on the study of coupling constants of 1H NMR spectra.
5,10-Bis(2,3-didecylthiophen-5-yl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (NDFT) was obtained by the Stille cross-coupling reaction of 3 and 4,5-didecyl-2-tributylstannylthiophene in toluene with bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride as the catalyst. The 2,7-bis(trimethyltin)-5,10-bis(2,3-didecylthiophen-5-yl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]difuran (M1) was synthesized in 79% yield by lithiation of NDFT, followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride. The polymer PNDFT-DTBT was synthesized by Stille polycondensation of M1 and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexyl-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) in the presence of tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium as the catalyst and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine as the ligand in anhydrous toluene. The polymer was purified by washing with menthol, acetone and hexane to remove oligomers and other impurities, and then was extracted with hot chloroform in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h. After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, a deep blue solid with metallic luster was obtained in 71% yield. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) was 18 kDa and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 1.3 determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with tetrahydrofuran as eluent against polystyrene standards. The polymer was soluble in common organic solvents such as toluene, CB, tetrahydrofuran, and showed good film-forming properties.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the new polymer had good thermal stability with the onset point of decomposition (the temperature of 5% weight-loss) at 464 °C (Fig. 1). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of the polymers showed no apparent thermal transition for the polymers between 20 °C and 300 °C (Fig. S11).


The absorption spectra of PNDFT-DTBT in solution and as a solid film are shown in Fig. 2. The PNDFT-DTBT showed the dual absorption profile of typical donor–acceptor type polymers in both solution and as a thin film. The short wavelength peaks located at ca. 380 nm can be ascribed to the π–π* transition. The long wavelength peaks located at ca. 550–640 nm can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the NDFT donor and the DTBT acceptor. The PNDFT-DTBT showed the main absorption peak at 576 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 5.26 × 104 M−1 cm−1 in chloroform solution (10−5 mol L−1). The main absorption peak in the thin-film spectrum was red-shifted ca. 50 nm compared to the peak in the solution spectrum. This bathochromic-shift indicated that strong intermolecular interaction and aggregation occurred in the solid-state of the polymers. The optical bandgap of the polymer was calculated from the onset of the thin-film absorption spectrum. It was 715 nm corresponding to a bandgap (Eg) of 1.73 eV.


The electrochemical properties of polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The cyclic voltammogram of PNDFT-DTBT is shown in Fig. 3. The potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+). It was assumed that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ had an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV to vacuum. The potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured under the same conditions and was located at 0.09 V related to the Ag/Ag+ electrode. Both p- and n-doping processes were irreversible for the polymer, the onset oxidation (p-doping) was at 0.64 V and the onset reduction (n-doping) was at −1.27 V. Accordingly, LUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV) and HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV), The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were calculated to be −5.35 eV and −3.44 eV. The relatively deep HOMO energy level of the polymer can be favourable for achieving high open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PCS devices and also might benefit the stability of the polymer by avoiding unintentional p-doping.


The photovoltaic properties of the polymer were investigated in BHJ solar cell devices with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/MoO3/Al (Table 1 and Fig. 4). The polymers were used as the donor and PC61BM was used as the acceptor. The active layer was processed with chlorobenzene (CB) and the concentration of donor material was 10 mg mL−1. Solar cells were characterized under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 from a Newport solar simulator. The short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of devices were significantly enhanced with the increasing weight ratios of PC61BM to donor polymer (Table 1). The fill factor (FF) of devices also increased with the increase of the ratios. However, the open circuit voltage (Voc) showed little change with change of the ratios. Solar cells based on PNDFT-DTBT/PC61BM (1:3) as the photoactive layer (thickness of 85 nm) exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 5.22%, a Jsc of 8.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, and a high FF of 0.72. The PNDFT-DTBT achieved the highest performance in solar cell devices among all polymers based on NDF building blocks. The thermal annealing of the active layers resulted in dropping of photovoltaic performances. The adverse effect of annealing on photovoltaic performance could be ascribed to the macro-scale phase separation. Similar phenomena have been reported on poly(3-alkylthiophene). Addition of a processing additive, diiodooctane (DIO) before spin-coating did not show any improvement on device performances. Chloroform was also used as the processing solvent. The devices processed with chloroform showed similar performances as devices processed with CB.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of PSC devices are shown in Fig. 4b. The EQE spectra showed that the new polymer based devices exhibited a broad photo-response range from 300 to 700 nm and the highest EQE value of the devices exceeded 60% (Fig. 4b). The morphology of the active layer plays an important role in the device performances. A proper morphology is necessary not only for exciton dissociation but also for charge transport to respective contacts. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the morphology of the polymer/PC61BM active layer. Topography and phase images were taken from the film of polymer/PC61BM (1:3, w/w) blends casted from CB (Fig. 5). The active layer showed good phase separation with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 2.46 nm.

A new NDF building block (NDFT) has been designed and synthesized as a building block for conjugated polymers. The new monomer was fully characterized and was applied to the synthesis of the conjugated polymer (PNDFT-DTBT). The photovoltaic properties of the PNDFT-DTBT were evaluated in bulk hetero-junction polymer solar cell devices with PC61BM as acceptors. The PSC devices showed relatively high performances without using any processing additives or post-treatment. These results indicated that the new monomer could be a promising building block for conjugated polymers for high-performance PSC devices.
