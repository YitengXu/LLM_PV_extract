In this communication, glycine, an amino acid, was applied to modify the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction interface for reducing the inevitable defects formed during crystallization of perovskite. The power conversion efficiency of the resulting perovskite solar cell was increased from 8.35 to 12.02%, attributed to the enhancement of the short-circuit current density.

Since the pioneering work in 2009, organolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have evolved as a promising light sensitizer for the next generation of dye-sensitized solar cells, due to their superb light-harvesting characteristics and ambipolar transport properties. Within a short period of time, the configuration of devices from the liquid type to all solid types was achieved by substituting the liquid electrolyte with a hole transporting material such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD). Nowadays, perovskite solar cells can be divided into two categories: one is heterojunction (with mesoporous metal oxide) and the other is planar structure cells with a p–i–n junction, both exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4% (ref. 7) and 19.3%, respectively.

Although planar perovskite solar cells showed a higher PCE and simpler manufacturing process, mesoporous metal oxides such as TiO2 could prevent short circuiting between working and counter electrodes. In addition, the porous TiO2 (p-TiO2) layer may act as a scaffold to elongate the optical light path and retard the charge recombination. However, the incomplete pore-filling of TiO2 with perovskite to decrease the performance of devices was the major concern with this process. Hence two-step deposition by spin-coating PbI2 on top of the p-TiO2 layer and then crystallizing with CH3NH3I to fabricate the perovskite light harvester was developed to reduce the morphological variation of perovskite. Notably, although the photovoltaic performance and reproducibility of the solar cells were improved, the deposition of perovskite crystals on the TiO2 scaffold still inevitably caused defects at the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction. Recently, several research groups reported that the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells could be improved through amphipathic molecule treatment on the TiO2 surface. Therefore, in this work, we modified the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface by introducing glycine, a kind of amino acid, as a coupling agent. Through this modification, the best PCE of the perovskite solar cell was increased from 8.35 to 12.02%, mainly due to the enhancement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 14.42 to 19.54 mA cm−2.
Photovoltaic characterization of solar cells was carried out at full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) with a 1000 W ozone-free xenon lamp equipped with a water-based IR filter and AM 1.5 filter (Newport Corporation). The measured conditions were set as a forward scan (from forward bias to short-circuit) with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. Fig. 1 shows the best J–V curves of perovskite solar cells based on the TiO2 treated with and without glycine.
Obviously the glycine modified sample exhibited a much higher photocurrent than the non-modified one. Fig. 2 shows the statistical PCE values on a larger batch of ten photovoltaic devices. All the average parameters with glycine-treated TiO2 were superior to those with bare TiO2 as can be seen in Table 1. The average PCE of perovskite solar cells was increased from 6.99 to 9.48%, mainly due to the improvement of Jsc since the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) were barely enhanced. X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X'Pert PRO) was conducted to analyze the crystallography of perovskite with a scan step size of 0.013° and 3.57 s for each step (Fig. S1). The appearance of diffraction peaks was in agreement with the published literature. However, unfortunately, it is hard to compare the results of the perovskite deposited on mesoporous TiO2 with and without treatment of glycine. It might be due to the fact that the tiny amount of perovskite crystals formed in the interface of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 was barely detected by X-ray diffraction.

Therefore, to realize how the amino acid affected the crystallization of PbI2, we investigated the crystal structure of PbI2 on top of the compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) with and without glycine treatment in a planar configuration first. Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns. The crystal of PbI2 is a layered structure with the basic building block that Pb atoms are sandwiched in between two layers of I atoms. In Fig. 3(a), the diffraction peaks of PbI2 can be indexed to a hexagonal system (JCPDS, PDF number 07-0235), and the (001) lattice plane is clearly observed for both samples. However, the sample treated with glycine exhibited stronger signals at (002), (003), and (004) lattice planes, implying that the PbI2 tended to grow in an orientation along the c axis. As can been seen from scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6300) images, the morphology of PbI2 depositing on glycine-treated c-TiO2 (Fig. 4(a)) differs from the bare c-TiO2 (Fig. 4(b)). Without glycine, PbI2 crystallized into a broader size range of 200–600 nm with more voids. In contrast, the PbI2 grown on the glycine-treated c-TiO2 displays less and smaller voids with a narrow crystal size range of 200–300 nm. Obviously, glycine has induced PbI2 crystals to grow along the c axis with the direction perpendicular to the TiO2 surface, beneficial to the following perovskite crystallization.

Fig. 3(b) shows the XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite prepared by using the previous PbI2 to crystallize with CH3NH3I (see ESI for Experimental details). Compared to the bare c-TiO2, the treatment of glycine rendered the perovskite with stronger diffractions at (111) and (404) lattice planes. However, we did not observe any apparent difference between these two perovskites in the SEM investigation (see Fig. S2). It may be due to the fact that the usual information depth of XRD measurements ranging from a few micrometers to a few hundred micrometers is deeper than the thickness of perovskite (∼300 nm) and the subtle change of the lattice plane induced by glycine was beneath the surface investigated by SEM. To further explore the crystal growth immediately on the surface of TiO2, we diluted the original 1.0 M PbI2 solution to ∼0.1 M and investigated the surface morphology of the resulting perovskite by SEM. Notably, the crystalline structure of PbI2 immediately grew on the glycine-treated c-TiO2 also shows less and smaller voids (see Fig. S3). As it was crystallized with CH3NH3I, the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals covering on the surface of TiO2 was significantly more complete than that on non-modified TiO2 (see Fig. 5), possibly owing to the denser PbI2 crystals on the surface performing as the foundation for growth of the perovskite crystals.
Moreover, the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals on glycine-treated c-TiO2 preferred their [111] direction which is consistent with the XRD patterns (see Fig. 3(b)) and the size was also larger. Presumably, the carboxylic acid group of glycine was prone to anchor on the TiO2, whereas its outward amine group acted as the nucleation center for PbI2 deposition and crystal growth and herewith directly participated in the crystallization process of perovskite. The well-covered crystals on the TiO2 surface observed in Fig. 5(b) support this proposed mechanism. By comparing the SEM images between Fig. S3(a) and 5(a), the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals did not fully hold onto the top of bare c-TiO2 during crystallization. In contrast, the glycine-treated surface was apt to keep the perovskite on the TiO2 surface and promoted the crystal to grow evenly. This advanced the higher coverage of crystallized perovskite at the interface of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3.
To further investigate the contribution of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface to the photovoltaic performance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to characterize the charge transfer dynamics of perovskite solar cells with a real configuration (containing p-TiO2) by analysing the variation in impedance related to the different interfaces of the device. As shown in Fig. 6, Nyquist plots of the perovskite solar cells based on bare TiO2 and glycine-treated TiO2 analysed under illumination were fitted well with Z-view software by setting the equivalent circuit shown in the inset figure. Three R–C circuits in series were employed (note: we did not observe the feature contributed by the interface of the spiro-MeOTAD/gold counter electrode at high frequency mentioned in ref. 19, probably due to the limited frequency range of our instrument). In our case, the difference between two specimens was only the presence of glycine. The first arc in Fig. 6 shows the huge difference between the perovskite solar cells with and without modification of glycine. This result points out the strong influence of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface upon the feature of the first arc. Similar results have also been reported in the literature. Accordingly, in our system, the first arc combines the complex interfaces of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD. The reduced resistance at the first arc of the glycine-modified device (from 213.6 Ω to 101.8 Ω) would be due to the better contact and coverage of perovskite on the TiO2 surface. Besides, we also observed the transmission line following the first arc at intermediate frequency. The appearance of the transmission line has been suggested to be due to the transport resistance of charges lower than the recombination resistance at the interface. Therefore, the much lower resistance (reduced from 230.4 Ω to 44.8 Ω) at this region means the modification of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction with glycine led to the more efficient charge transfer from perovskite to TiO2. However, the feature of the second arc in Fig. 6 did not have much difference after modification of glycine (139.3 Ω for bare TiO2 and 109.2 Ω for glycine-TiO2). After all, the reduced resistance by the modification of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction with glycine was considered to be the major contribution to the better photovoltaic performance for perovskite solar cells.

We have successfully demonstrated the crucial role of amino acid as a coupling agent to modify the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction interface for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of two-step solution-processed perovskite solar cells. With this promising glycine modification, higher coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals on the TiO2 surface was obtained, resulting in more efficient charge transfer and higher photocurrent. Based on our results, we believe that this modification has created a new breakthrough for the research of perovskite solar cells.
