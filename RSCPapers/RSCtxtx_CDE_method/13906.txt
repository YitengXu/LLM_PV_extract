2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) currently is the most common hole transport material (HTM) used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Whereas, the hole mobility of amorphous spiro-OMeTAD remains low and may result in severe charge recombination. In addition, the harsh conditions and high cost of spiro-OMeTAD synthesis are also disadvantageous for future large-scale applications. In this paper, we report the synthesis of a new, high-yielding spiro-type HTM, 2,7-di(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-2′,7′-di-tert-butyl-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-027). The replacement of two 4,4′-dimeoxyl-diphenylamine at the 2′ and 7′ positions of conventional spiro-OMeTAD with two tert-butyl in spiro-027 results in a greatly simplified molecular structure with unaffected thermal stability or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In addition, enhanced hole mobility is observed in spiro-027. Thus, the PSC devices based on spiro-027 demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.60%, which was higher than the 16.12% PCE achieved by those based on spiro-OMeTAD. By combining these results with theoretical calculations, our work confirmed the feasibility of simplifying the molecular structure of spiro-OMeTAD, which contributed to our knowledge of spiro-type optoelectronic functional materials. Moreover, our results offer a novel strategy for the replacement of expensive HTMs and the enhancement of PSCs performance.

In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which utilize hybrid metal halides CH3NH3PbX3 as light absorbers, have greatly progressed in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 9.7% (ref. 1) in 2012 to 22.1% (ref. 2) in 2016, achieving the frontier of photovoltaics. The hole transport material (HTM) deposited at the top of the perovskite is a key component in PSCs and is crucial to photovoltaic performance. In general, the correct electronic energy level alignment between the valence band of perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of HTM is a prerequisite for the extraction of photo-induced holes. Ease of film formation, high carrier mobility, and good stability against heating and light are also desirable properties for sufficient interfacial contact, fast hole transport, and long-term durability. Compared with polymer HTMs, small-molecule materials are easier to synthesize and purify, and their structures are more convenient to modify. Although many new HTMs have been developed, such as the derivatives of carbazole, triazine, triarylamine, and azomethine, the most efficient HTM used in PSCs is currently 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).

The excellent performance of spiro-OMeTAD is believed to result from the structural advantages of the spirobifluorene-based core structure, which is composed of two orthogonal fluorenes, and the rigid stereo structure, which prevents molecular aggregation and confers good solubility in organic solvents. Nevertheless, the hole mobility of amorphous spiro-OMeTAD remains low and may result in severe charge recombination. The harsh conditions and high cost of spiro-OMeTAD synthesis are also disadvantageous for future large-scale applications. More importantly, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the molecular structures of spirobifluorene derivatives and their optical and electrical properties is still lacking. Relevant investigations aimed at obtaining more efficient and low-cost alternatives have been conducted in the recent two years. Seok et al. reported that the HOMO energy level of spiro-OMeTAD is associated with the position of the methoxy group on aminophenyl; para or meta substitution mainly decreases the HOMO level, whereas the ortho substitution increases the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. Consequently, an arrangement integrating para-methoxyphenyl and ortho-methoxyphenyl (po-spiro-OMeTAD) produced a high PCE of 16.7%. Studies of Chen and Sun both indicated that the incorporation of triphenylamine into the spiro-core to form an N-benzene-N subunit is an effective strategy for the tuning of the electrical properties of spiro-type HTM; by this method, the PCEs of PSCs were enhanced remarkably and showed less dependence on dopant. Theoretical investigations on spiro-type HTMs have also been performed to either explore their electrochemical properties or identify optimal compounds.
As an alternative to the design of complicated compounds, this paper reports the synthesis of a new, high-yielding spiro-type HTM, 2,7-di(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-2′,7′-di-tert-butyl-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-027). The replacement of two 4,4′-dimeoxyl-diphenylamine at the 2′ and 7′ positions of conventional spiro-OMeTAD with two tert-butyl in spiro-027 results in a greatly simplified molecular structure with unaffected thermal stability or HOMO and LOMO. In addition, enhanced hole mobility is observed in spiro-027. Thus, the PSC devices based on spiro-027 demonstrated a high PCE of 16.60%, which was higher than the 16.12% PCE achieved by those based on spiro-OMeTAD. By combining these results with theoretical calculations, our work confirmed the feasibility of simplifying the molecular structure of spiro-OMeTAD, which contributed to our knowledge of spiro-type optoelectronic functional materials. Moreover, our results offer a novel strategy for the replacement of expensive HTMs and the enhancement of PSCs performance.

As depicted in Scheme 1, the new HTM spiro-027 was synthesized via a one-step reaction of 2,7-dibromo-2′,7′-di-tert-butyl-9,9′-spirobifluorene and 4,4′-dimeoxyl-di-phenylamine, resulting in a high yield of 79.3%. The synthetic procedures are described in greater detail in the Experimental section. Notably, the synthetic conditions of spiro-027, particularly during purification, are not as harsh as that of spiro-OMeTAD. Compared with spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-027 has two 4,4′-dimeoxyl-diphenylamine substituents at the 2′ and 7′ positions of spirobifluorene replaced with two tert-butyl, resulting in a greatly simplified molecular structure. Research published within the last two years reported new spiro-type HTMs with certain attractive features, such as increased carrier mobility or low dependence on dopant, but with molecular structures that are generally more complicated. Our work was carried out to test whether the complicated four 4,4′-dimeoxyl-diphenylamine substituents of spiro-OMeTAD are necessary for HTM synthesis, as well as to determine the effect of a different type of substituent on the optoelectronic properties of HTM, specifically the photovoltaic performance of resulting PSCs.

Fig. 1(a) shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of spiro-OMeTAD and spiro-027 dissolved by chlorobenzene, with two characteristic absorption peaks in the UV range observed for both HTMs. The first characteristic absorption peak appeared before 320 nm and was attributed to the aromatic ring of the two HTMs; the blue shift of ∼10 nm for spiro-027 versus spiro-OMeTAD was explained by 4,4′-dimeoxyl-diphenylamine having a greater electron-donating ability than tert-butyl. The second peak observed at 390 nm for both spiro-OMeTAD and spiro-027 was ascribed to the conjugated system composed of triarylamine; with two more triarylamine units, spiro-OMeTAD understandably presented a higher absorbance than spiro-027. The optional band gaps of the two HTMs were also estimated based on the absorption onset at 2.95 eV for spiro-OMeTAD and 2.99 eV for spiro-027. The results of thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) in Fig. 1(b) show that spiro-027 had an exceptional thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of up to ∼400 °C, which was comparable with that of spiro-OMeTAD. Thus, the tert-butyl substitution at the 2′ and 7′ positions of spirobifluorene almost had no influence on the light-induced electronic transition or thermal stability of spiro-type HTM.
To evaluate the alignment of energy levels between HTMs and perovskite, electrochemical characterization was conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV), with ferrocene as a standard reference. The CV curves of the two HTMs are shown in Fig. 2(a), in which the three pairs of redox-reduction peaks observed for spiro-OMeTAD were consistent with previous reports. By contrast, the two pairs of peaks observed for spiro-027 remain unclear. Both HTMs displayed good electrochemical reversibility and similar oxidation potential. HOMO energy levels were both −5.16 eV, which matched the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (−5.44 eV). These levels were highly conductive to interfacial charge transfer. Based on the abovementioned optional band gaps, the LUMO energy levels of spiro-027 and spiro-OMeTAD were determined to be at −2.19 and −2.21 eV, respectively. Fig. 2(b) demonstrates the energy level diagram of the corresponding materials applied in PSCs, in which a large energy barrier (1.74 eV) between the LUMO of spiro-027 and the conduction band edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV) could efficiently block electrons and suppress charge recombination.
For HTMs used in PSCs, high hole mobility guarantees fast transport of holes after interfacial extraction and assists in reducing the whole series resistance of the device, thereby enhancing the photovoltaic properties. Hole mobility of HTMs in this work was tested using the model of the space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs), with a simple device structure of FTO/HTM/Ag. The mobility values of the two HTMs were obtained by fitting the current density–voltage (J–V) curves (Fig. 2(c)). These values, which are listed in Table 1, showed that the hole mobility of pristine spiro-027 was slightly higher than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD. In addition, we also measured the conductive properties of the two HTMs doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBp), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)-tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)-imide) (FK209), which were conducted using a two-contact electrical conductivity set-up. As depicted in Fig. 2(d), the conductivity of the doped spiro-027 also prevails that of doped spiro-OMeTAD. In this work, theoretical investigation has been performed for further exploration using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Reorganization energy (ER) is the energy cost due to geometry modifications to go from a neutral to a charged oligomer. It is one of the key characteristics that control charge mobility in organic electronics. According to Marcus equation, a lower ER implies smaller geometry relaxations and higher electron transfer rate. Results shown in Table 1 suggested that the reorganization energy (ER) of spiro-027 (136 meV) was smaller than that of spiro-OMeTAD (267 meV), which can well explain why spiro-027 illustrates higher conductivity than spiro-OMeTAD.

We investigated the photovoltaic properties of spiro-027 as HTM in PSCs by J–V and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements, with spiro-OMeTAD-based devices fabricated for comparison. The configuration of the conventional hybrid mesoscopic solar cell was FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 + perovskite/HTM/Ag, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 3(b) clearly demonstrated all the functional layers and the interfaces of the devices. The CH3NH3PbI3 layer was prepared by a two-step sequential deposition approach. Fabrication of the whole device is detailed in the Experimental section.
The J–V curves of the champion devices based on spiro-027 and spiro-OMeTAD are illustrated in Fig. 3(c), and the corresponding values of the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) simulated solar illumination, the spiro-OMeTAD-based device delivered an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.06 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.47 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71, yielding a PCE of 16.12%. By comparison, the PCE of the spiro-027-based device was 16.60%. To substantiate the comparison between the two HTMs, 30 devices were fabricated for each group. The obtained average values for each parameter are listed in Table 2. The average JSC of the spiro-027-based devices was slightly higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, which was probably related to the higher conductivity of spiro-027.

The abovementioned results suggested that the simplification of the molecular structure of spiro-OMeTAD into spiro-027 did not introduce any negative effect on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting PSC. The IPCE spectra of PSCs fabricated using each of the two HTMs is presented in Fig. 3(d). The device using spiro-027 as HTM displayed a wide response to the solar spectra and showed a high photon-to-electron external quantum yield in the range of 350–750 nm, which was comparable with those of the device based on spiro-OMeTAD. The integrated current densities calculated from the IPCE spectra were also consistent with the measured JSC values.
The performance parameters of the 30 devices based on each of the two HTMs are shown in Fig. 4(a). About 67% of the devices exhibited PCEs over 15%, indicating good reproducibility. The statistical data of VOC, JSC, and FF of these devices are listed in ESI. The J–V curves of the devices containing either spiro-027 or spiro-OMeTAD showed evident hysteretic behavior, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and Table 3. Hysteresis is frequently reported in PSCs, which can be explained by the intrinsic ferroelectric response of perovskite, ion migration or slow dynamic process of capacitive current, and occurrence of charge trapping/detrapping. However, PSCs with similar cell architecture and spiro-OMeTAD in previous studies demonstrated less pronounced hysteresis. We ascribed the hysteretic behavior observed in our work to the suboptimal assembling conditions employed, which influenced perovskite crystallinity, interfacial charge transfer, and recombination.

In summary, under less harsh synthetic conditions, we synthesized a novel spiro-type HTM for PSCs, namely, spiro-027, with a simplified molecular structure compared with that of the traditional spiro-OMeTAD. Systematic investigations were carried out to evaluate the thermal, optical, and electrical properties of the material. Relative to spiro-OMeTAD, the replacement of two 4,4′-dimeoxyl-diphenylamine with two tert-butyl in the 2′ and 7′ positions greatly simplified the molecular structure without affecting the thermal stability or the energy levels of the resulting product. Moreover, spiro-027 was superior to spiro-OMeTAD in hole mobility. As a result, PSC devices based on spiro-027 demonstrated high PCEs of up to 16.60%, which was higher than the 16.12% PCE achieved by those based on spiro-OMeTAD. Upon combining these results with theoretical calculations, our work confirmed the feasibility of simplifying the molecular structure of spiro-OMeTAD. The results of this study contribute to our knowledge of spiro-type optoelectronic functional materials and offer a new strategy for the replacement of expensive HTMs and the enhancement of PSCs performance.


2,7-Dibromo-2′,7′-di-tert-butyl-9,9′-spirobifluoren (4.0 g, 7 mmol), 4,4′-dimeoxyl-diphenylamine (3.3 g, 14 mmol), (t-Bu)ONa (2.6 g, 25 mmol) and toluene were added to a 250 mL round-bottom flask degassed with N2 for 10 minutes. Then (t-Bu)3PH·BF4 (0.15 g, 0.54 mmol) and Pd2(dba)3 (0.25 g, 0.27 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture which was stirred at reflux under N2 for 10 h subsequently. Water was added to the mixture when it was cooled to room temperature. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 50 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and the solvents removed under vacuum. The crude product was filtered through a pad of silica gel using toluene as the eluent and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was stirred in ethanol under reflux to give spiro-027 as a light yellow solid (4.9 g, 79.3%). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO) δ (ppm) 7.68–7.65 (m, 4H), 7.37 (s, 1H), 7.35 (s, 1H), 6.76–6.66 (m, 20H), 6.05 (s, 2H), 3.61 (s, 12H), 1.19 (s, 18H).

1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 400 MHz Spectrometer. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra (MALDI-TOF) were performed on a Waters MALDI micro MX instrument. The sample morphologies were observed using SEM (FEI QUANTA 450). UV-vis absorbance spectra of the two HTMs were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (HP 8543, Hewlett Packard, USA) at room temperature. Thermal analysis was measured by TGA (SDT851, Switzerland) at a temperature range of 0 °C to 800 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Tafel measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 630D, Chenhua, Shanghai) with a working area of 1.9 cm2. CV was conducted by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 630D) with ferrocene as a standard reference. The conventional three-electrode configuration consisted of a glassy carbon working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode. Hole mobility, fitted by the J–V curves, was investigated by the SCLCs method:

Patterned transparent conducting oxide glass (FTO, 19 mm × 19 mm) was treated with ultrasonic cleaning for 20 min with aqueous detergent solution, acetone, 2-propanol, and ethanol, sequentially. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the pre-cleaned FTO substrate through spin coating deposition of TiO2 organic sol at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a sintering process in a furnace at 450 °C for 2 h. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was prepared by spin coating a commercial TiO2 paste that was diluted in ethanol (1:6, mass ratio) onto the compact TiO2 layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The film was gradually sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. A PbI2 precursor solution (462 mg PbI2 in 1 mL of DMF and DMSO mixed solvent) was then spin coated on the film at 3000 rpm for 30 s in glove box. Later a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (30 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s on the PbI2 film, which was annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 20 min afterward to form the crystallized CH3NH3PbI3. The HTM was then spin coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. HTM was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-027 or spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene, doping with 28.8 μL tBp, 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI in acetonitrile and 20 μL of a stock solution of 300 mg mL−1 FK209 in acetonitrile. Finally, a silver layer (60 nm) was thermally evaporated on the top of the device to serve as the back contact. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.105 cm2. All devices were fabricated in glove box.


The J–V curves of PSCs were measured by a Keithley 2450 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2, PEC-L15, Peccell, Japan). IPCE values were measured using the monochromatic light from a system made of a xenon lamp, a monochromator, and appropriate filters.
