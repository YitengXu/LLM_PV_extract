Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) are emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for building integration. However, how to solve the trade-off between power-conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT) is always the key point for the further development of ST-OSCs. Herein, a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer, by sequentially depositing a polymer donor layer (PM6) and a small-molecule acceptor layer (BTP-eC9), was employed to improve the device performance and AVT, resulting in PCEs of 18.5% for opaque devices and 13.3% for semitransparent OSCs with an AVT of 18.5%. Furthermore, by introducing an effective anti-reflective covering layer, the AVT of the ST-OSCs was further improved up to 27.8% with little minus effect on the PCE (13.1%), as well as an impressive light-utilization efficiency (LUE) of 3.64% and a color-rendering index (CRI) of 94.6. It is worth noting that the PCE of 13.1% is the highest value at an AVT of over 25%. Our strategy represents a unique approach for improving the AVT and PCE of ST-OSCs simultaneously, facilitating the commercial development of OSCs.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs), as a promising technology for clean energy, have attracted much attention due to their advantages of easy fabrication, lightweight, flexibility, semitransparency, and being suitable for large-scale roll-to-roll processing. As an important type of OSCs, semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs), with appealing features of transparency and color tunability, exhibit great potential application in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which can utilize the large surface areas of windows, roofs, sidewalls and glass facades in modern urban environments to produce power-generating solar windows, and are considered one of the key business markets for future OSCs. In recent years, with the rapid development of narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptors, ST-OSCs are emerging as a new research hotspot in the field of OSCs.

In general, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT) are thought to be the key parameters to evaluate ST-OSCs. The AVT is generally estimated by taking an average of the transparency of the device in the visible wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm based on the spectrally dependent response of the human eye. Although the transparency needed for the integration of ST-OSCs in various applications is completely dependent on the working environment, a minimum AVT of over 25% in the visible light range is thought to be desirable for practical applications. Hence, there is a trade-off relationship between the PCE and AVT, which ultimately limited the performance of ST-OSCs. In order to solve this problem, tremendous efforts have been devoted in the past decade, including designing active layer materials with stronger near-infrared (NIR) absorption but weaker visible absorption, optimizing semitransparent top electrodes such as ultrathin metal, poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), Ag nanowires, and graphene, developing the device engineering approaches, including photonic crystals, antireflection coating, the multi-component strategy or adjusting the donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio and optimizing the active layer thickness. Hence, a PCE of ∼12% with an AVT of over 25% has been achieved.
Different from the most prevalent active layer structure of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ), the pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) structure by the sequential deposition (SD) method has gradually demonstrated some unique advantages to balance the PCE and AVT in ST-OSCs. The active layer with the PPHJ structure can allow for more freedom to modulate the optical and charge transport properties, in which the donor and acceptor layers can be optimized independently and the desired vertical component distribution can be achieved simultaneously. Considering that the donor component absorbs mainly photons of visible light while the acceptor component absorbs strongly at NIR wavelengths, both Huang et al. and Wei et al. achieved the simultaneously enhanced PCE and AVT using the PPHJ strategy in comparison with the BHJ, by simply adjusting the thickness of the acceptor layer or the donor layer while fixing the other layer. Furthermore, compared with the BHJ structure, the PPHJ structure is beneficial for the reduction of the optical loss and conducive to printing. Very recently, Chen et al. fabricated the ternary ST-OSCs with the PPHJ structure and achieved an excellent PCE of 14.62% with a considerable AVT of 20.42%. These results demonstrate that the PPHJ structure should be favorable to fabricate efficient ST-OSCs. In this work, the combined strategy of the PPHJ structure and the anti-reflective covering (ARC) layer was adopted to balance the device performance and the AVT in ST-OSCs.
By finely adjusting the thermal annealing (TA) post-treatment conditions, the blend morphology and vertical-phase distribution in the PPHJ active layer based on PM6/BTP-eC9 were further optimized and the charge recombination was effectively suppressed. Therefore, the related opaque devices showed an outstanding PCE of 18.5%, while the semitransparent devices showed a PCE of 13.3% with an AVT of 18.5%. In addition, when we introduced an ARC layer of MgF2 and MoO3 in ST-OSCs, a champion PCE of 13.1% with an AVT of 27.8% and a color-rendering index (CRI) of 94.6 were achieved, which is the record efficiency value for the ST-OSCs with an AVT of over 25% to our best knowledge. These results provide a new approach for achieving ST-OSCs with both high efficiency and transparency.

Herein, the blend system of PM6:BTP-eC9 was selected to fabricate the PPHJ device as shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the chemical structures of PM6 and BTP-eC9. The energy alignments of the materials, which comprised the device, are shown in Fig. 1c. Fig. 1d illustrates the normalized absorption spectra of the pure PM6 and BTP-eC9 films, which exhibited a complementary absorption between 300 and 1000 nm. Fig. 1e and Fig. S1 (ESI) show the absorption coefficients of different PPHJ and BHJ films. Without TA, the absorption coefficient of the PPHJ film was lower than that of the BHJ one in the donor absorption range. However, after thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the absorption coefficient of the PPHJ film was considerably enhanced both in the donor and acceptor absorption ranges, while maintaining the similar donor absorption range and improved NIR absorption, which is beneficial for the light-harvesting of the devices.


The opaque OSCs with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al were constructed. In order to obtain the best performance OSCs, a series of PPHJ devices with different processing conditions were fabricated. The details for fabricating the devices are provided in the ESI. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a and b and Fig. S2–S4 (ESI). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1–S3. PM6:BTP-eC9 based BHJ OSCs exhibited a PCE of 17.3%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.84 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 76.9%. For the PPHJ OSCs without TA post-treatment, an inferior PCE of 16.2% was achieved with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.4%. After optimizing under TA conditions, the best PPHJ device (with TA treatment at 80 °C for 5 min) displayed an outstanding PCE of 18.5%, with a similar VOC of 0.84 V, a significantly enhanced JSC of 27.6 mA cm−2 and an improved FF of 79.5%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 18.5% is among the highest values obtained for PPHJ OSCs (Fig. S5 and Table S4, ESI). It is worth noting that the VOC values of different devices are basically the same, which corresponds to their similar optical bandgaps (1.37, 1.36 and 1.36 eV for the PPHJ without TA, PPHJ with TA, and BHJ devices, respectively). Furthermore, compared with the optimized BHJ devices, the excellent PPHJ devices with TA exhibited an increased JSC and FF. This benefits from the larger absorption intensity and better morphology and molecular packing of the active layer, which will be discussed in the following sections.

The photocurrent density (Jph = JL − JD) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff = V0 − Vbias) was investigated to explore the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties of PPHJ devices without or with TA treatment and BHJ devices. As shown in Fig. 2c, where JL and JD represent the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Vbias is the applied voltage in the devices. Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density when Veff reaches 2 V in these devices. According to the specific values of Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit and maximum power output condition, the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) were determined to be 96.4%/85.3% for the PPHJ devices without TA treatment, 98.6%/91.0% for the PPHJ devices with TA treatment, and 97.9%/88.9% for BHJ devices. The higher ηdiss and ηcoll values indicate more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction properties in the corresponding PPHJ devices with TA treatment, which resulted in higher JSC and FF values and thus the improved PCE.

To further investigate the charge recombination behavior in the devices under different processing conditions, the dependence of JSC on the light intensity (Plight) was measured, which can be related to the power-law formula of JSC ∝ PlightS (Fig. S6a, ESI). The closer parameter S is to 1, the weaker the bimolecular recombination in the active layer. The PPHJ device with TA showed the highest S value of 0.993 in comparison with those of 0.968 for the PPHJ device without TA and 0.971 for the BHJ device, suggesting the relatively reduced bimolecular recombination in the devices. Furthermore, the relationship of VOC with Plight was also studied, which can be VOC ∝ n(kT/q)lnPlight, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature and q is the elementary charge (Fig. S6b, ESI). The n value should be larger than 1 when the trap-assisted recombination occurred in the devices. The PPHJ device with TA showed the lowest n value of 1.12 compared with those of 1.26 for the PPHJ device without TA and 1.17 for the BHJ device, which indicated the least trap-assisted recombination in the PPHJ device with TA.
Insight into the charge recombination and extraction dynamics is attained from transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) experiments. The TPC was employed to explore the competition between free carries recombination and extraction processes (Fig. 2d). The charge-extraction time of the PPHJ devices with TA was 0.17 μs, shorter than the PPHJ devices without TA (0.31 μs) and BHJ devices (0.22 μs), implying the most effective charge extraction in the PPHJ devices with TA. As shown in Fig. 2e, the charge recombination lifetimes of the PPHJ devices with and without TA and the BHJ devices were 3.55, 1.92, and 2.82 μs, respectively. The most suppressed carrier recombination and the fastest charge extraction could also be responsible for the highest FF in the PPHJ devices with TA.
The charge transport properties of the PPHJ devices without and with TA and BHJ devices were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S7 and Table S5, ESI). The configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Al were used to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 2f, for PPHJ devices without TA, the measured hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe, respectively) were 6.22 × 10−4 and 5.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which were lower than those of the BHJ devices (μh and μe of 7.28 × 10−4 and 6.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). After TA, the PPHJ devices exhibited enhanced μh and μe of 8.33 × 10−4 and 7.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.05) compared with 1.24 for the PPHJ devices without TA and 1.16 for the BHJ devices indicated that the charge carrier transport is more efficient in the PPHJ devices with TA treatment.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to understand the morphological evolution processes of active layers in different device structures. As depicted in Fig. 3a–c, the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of PPHJ (without TA) films is 3.44 nm. However, after TA, the PPHJ films presented a moderate Rq of 1.87 nm, which is closer to BHJ films (Rq = 1.60 nm), indicating that TA could smoothen the surface of the PPHJ films. The obvious fibrous structure can be observed in the PPHJ film compared with the BHJ film, which can be seen from the corresponding AFM phase images (Fig. 3d–f). As depicted in Fig. 3g–i, the corresponding films were tested by TEM to investigate the evolution of the internal morphology of active layers. The TEM images revealed that the heterogeneous morphology and large phase separation can be observed in the PPHJ films without TA. After TA, smaller phase separation, more refined and uniform morphology were formed with the diffusion of the acceptor into the donor layer. And compared with the BHJ films, a clear fibrous network structure can be observed in the PPHJ films.

To examine the effects of processing methods on the molecular crystallinity and orientation, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed. The 2D scattering patterns and 1D intensity profiles along the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions are displayed in Fig. S8. All blend films adopted a preferred face-on orientation, evidenced by the strong (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction. As shown in Table S6, (ESI) the PPHJ blend film with TA exhibited relatively closer π–π stacking with a smaller distance, while a slightly enhanced lamellar distance in compared with the other two blend films. Furthermore, the crystal coherence length (CCL) was estimated by the Scherrer equation. It is noted that the CCL values of the PPHJ films with TA are 23.1 Å and 95.2 Å for the (010) peaks in the OOP direction and (100) peaks in the IP direction, respectively, which are higher than those for the PPHJ blend films without TA (21.2/75.7 Å) and BHJ blend films (21.7/89.8 Å). These results indicated that the PPHJ blend films with TA possessed the relatively higher crystallinity, which is beneficial to promote the charge dissociation and transport, resulting in the increased JSC and FF in the devices.

To gain further insight into the internal structure and vertical phase characteristics of the BHJ and PPHJ films, we further carried out time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to draw the vertical composition distribution measurement diagrams of the three active layer films. As shown in Fig. 4, the F signal (a unique element of PM6) and Cl signal (a unique element of BTP-eC9) were detected by TOF-SIMS. In the PPHJ films without TA, it can be seen that the F element accumulated more at the bottom (close to the anode) and the Cl element accumulated more at the top (close to the cathode), respectively. After TA, the Cl and F element intensities at the top and bottom of the PPHJ active layer decreased, while still being higher than that of the BHJ films. Consequently, it can be concluded that the SD method could facilitate a more reasonable vertical-phase distribution of the active layer and suitable TA conditions could promote the interdiffusions of the donor and acceptor while maintaining the ideal vertical-phase distribution.

Similar conclusions were also confirmed by the surface energy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests. The surface energy of different films was calculated from the contact angle (CA) data. Fig. S9 and Table S7 (ESI) show that the surface energy of the PPHJ films without TA (39.5 mN m−1) was close to that of the neat BTP-eC9 films (41.0 mN m−1), indicating that BTP-eC9 was abundant at the top surface. After TA, the surface energy decreased (38.8 mN m−1), demonstrating that TA promoted the diffusion of BTP-eC9 into the PM6 film. In addition, XPS was performed to further research the compositions of the top surfaces of the PPHJ films without and with TA and BHJ films. In the three films, Cl and F were employed as the characteristic elements of analysis. Fig. S10 and Table S8 (ESI) reveal that the Cl contents of the top surface of the PPHJ film decreased from 3.3% to 2.5%, whereas the F content increased from 1.2% to 1.5% after TA. By combining all the findings of these powerful characterizations, it can be speculated that the use of the SD method under suitable TA conditions can finely regulate the vertical phase separation of the active layers and obtain the characteristics and external performance that are clearly different from the BHJ structure, which is conducive to the further improvement of the device efficiency.

ST-OSCs were based on a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (94 nm)/PFN-Br (5 nm)/Au (1 nm)/ultra-thin Ag. A thin film of Ag with different thicknesses (5, 10, 15 and 20 nm) was deposited as the back electrode to improve the AVT of the devices. As shown in Fig. S11 and Table S9, upon regulating the Ag thickness, the AVT and the PCE have different changes. As the Ag thickness increased, the PCE gradually increased while the AVT of the device decreased sharply. Therefore, the LUE was used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of ST-OSCs. An ultra-thin Ag electrode of 5 nm achieved a high AVT of 23.2%, but its high electrical resistance resulted in a significant decrease in overall device parameters and led to a low PCE of 10.2% and a LUE of 2.36%. Semitransparent devices based on 20 nm Ag have the best photovoltaic performance; however, the too-thick silver electrode dramatically reduced the light transmittance of the devices, leading to an AVT of 13.5%, PCE of 15.7% and LUE of 2.12%. When the thickness of the silver electrode was 10 nm, the corresponding devices exhibited the best LUE of 2.46%, with an AVT of 18.5% and a PCE of 13.3%. Compared to PPHJ devices, the LUE of BHJ ST-OSCs was only 2.09, which comprised a PCE of 12.3% and an AVT of 17.0% (Fig. 5b and d and Table 2). And the superiority of the PPHJ structure in the preparation of ST-OSCs was demonstrated.

Although devices based on 10 nm Ag have achieved excellent photovoltaic performance, the AVT values of PPHJ ST-OSCs were still not high enough for applications as architectural glass. To solve this problem, the anti-reflective covering (ARC) layer which has the function to reduce reflection and photon loss was designed to manipulate the optical properties and obtain the higher AVT of the devices (Fig. 5a). After depositing MgF2 (100 nm) and MoO3 (35 nm) at the bottom of the ITO glass and the top of the Ag electrode, respectively, as the ARC layer, ST-OSCs with a 10 nm Ag electrode exhibited a significantly improved AVT of 27.8% and a slightly decreased PCE of 13.1% (Fig. 5b–d and Table 2), which is the highest value at an AVT of over 25% (Fig. 5e). When the thickness of the Ag electrode is increased to 15 nm, the PCE of ST-OSCs combined with ARC layer increased to 14.3%, while the corresponding AVT decreased to 23.1% (Fig. S13 and Table S10, ESI).


The human color perception of ST-OSCs was also evaluated by CRI or color coordinates (x, y) and correlated the color temperature (CCT). The color coordinates (x, y) can be described in the Commission Internationale deL Eclairage (CIE) 1931 color space (Fig. 5f). An ordinary white-light source with a color coordinate of (0.332, 0.344) was selected as the background light source. The color coordinates were measured when the white-light passed through PPHJ ST-OSCs. For the 10 nm Ag-based ST-OSCs, the color coordinate is (0.274, 0.275), together with a CRI of 87.2 and a CCT of 11874 K. After adding the ARC to the devices, the CRI increased to 94.6 with a color coordinate of (0.298, 0.325) and a CCT of 8076 K. Fig. 5g and h demonstrates the colored background viewed through air and PPHJ ST-OSCs with the ARC layer. The clearly observed background further confirmed the good color-rendering properties and the application potential of PPHJ ST-OSCs in power-generating windows.


We also tested the storage, thermal and light-soaking stabilities of the PPHJ and BHJ ST-OSCs without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. S14 in the ESI, when stored in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere for 500 h, the PCEs of the PPHJ devices and BHJ devices maintained about 94% and 89% of their initial values, respectively. For thermal stability, after being heated at 80 °C for 240 h, the PPHJ devices could retain 88% of their initial PCE, whereas the BHJ devices showed larger decay to 83% in the same duration. For light-soaking stability, after illumination for 240 h, the PPHJ devices retained about 92% of the initial PCE, and the BHJ devices retained a PCE of about 88% of the initial PCE. These aspects show that the improvement of the active layer structure is also conducive to the stability of the devices, which is ultimately beneficial for commercial applications.


In summary, we employed a new strategy, which combined the PPHJ structure and optical engineering, to fabricate high-performance ST-OSCs. During the preparation process, the interdiffusion between PM6 and BTP-eC9 was effectively controlled by changing the TA temperature and time extensively, generating an ideal vertical phase distribution in the PPHJ active layer and leading to a high PCE (18.5%) for the opaque devices, as well as a PCE of 13.3% and an AVT of 18.5% for semitransparent devices. More importantly, a more balanced PCE and the AVT have been successfully obtained when using the ARC on the surface of the devices; ST-OSCs achieved an AVT of 27.8% and a PCE of 13.1%, which is the highest value at an AVT of over 25%. These results demonstrated that the PPHJ structure combined with optical engineering exhibited great potential in realizing the commercial development of high-performance ST-OSCs.
