We demonstrate an N719 dye sensitized solar cell based on Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) as a counter electrode. The elements for the material are all earth abundant and environmentally benign. The power conversion efficiency of a DSSC using CFTS was comparable to that of a DSSC using Pt under A.M. 1.5G (100 mW cm−2).

Quaternary chalcogenides such as Cu2ZnSnS4, Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) and other related chemical compounds are of great interest when considering renewable energy. CFTS is environmentally benign and cheap to fabricate because of the abundance of elements such as Cu, Fe, Sn, and S in nature. The valence states of Cu(I), Fe(II), and Sn(IV) have been established to be 2:1:1:4 in atomic ratio, and various solid solution using CFTS was synthesized and investigated several years ago. Therefore, we can reduce the cost of production by utilizing natural resources on earth compared to In, Ga of Cu(InxGa1−x)Se2 (CIGS) and continue to exploit sufficient underground reserves of iron.

Likewise, there are other plausible materials as an alternative catalyst, including carbon materials, PEDOT related materials, PPy(polypyrrole), graphene, sulfur-doped nickel oxide, CoS, and CZTSSe. Recently, chalcogenide based counter electrodes (CEs) are emerging due to facileness to prepare at relatively low temperature compared to graphene based CEs and low fabrication cost resulting from the abundance of elements such as Cu, Fe, and S in nature. In CZTSSe, the power conversion efficiency is comparable to that of Pt when the material was spin cast and selenized. Thus we fabricated DSSC using many different chalcogenide compounds such as CuS, Cu2S, SnS2, CuSnS3, Cu2SnS4, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu2FeSnS4, as counter electrodes. Of those, the efficiency of the DSSC with Cu2FeSnS4 was the best. Also, among CFTSs with tetragonal, wurtzite, and zinc blende crystal structures, we have focused on stannite CFTS with zinc blende.
As shown in Fig. S1(a), the XRD pattern of the prepared CFTS nanoparticles indicates that they are in a zinc blende phase without any impurities such as FeS2, Cu2S, CuFeS2, or Cu3SnS4,with most intense peaks at 2θ = 28.5°, 47.2°, 47.6°, and 56.1° corresponding to (112), (220), (204), and (312) planes. The mean crystallite size diameter (D) of nanoparticles can be calculated based on the XRD spectra by Scherrer's formula (see ESI). In Fig. S1(b), the calculated sizes from full-width at half maximum (FWHM) are about 34 nm in diameter. It might be due to aggregation of CFTS after annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.
TEM images in Fig. 1(a,b) show that the size of CFTS nanoparticles is 11 to 15 nm and the CFTS nanoparticles are round-shaped, well-dispersed, and uniform. The selected area electron diffraction pattern in Fig. 1(c) matches the zinc blende coordinated structure of CFTS, as indicated by the diffraction spots corresponding to the (112), (004), (204), and (116) planes.
After annealing, the sizes of CFTS nanoparticles are about in the range of 30–40 nm as shown in the SEM image in Fig. 2(a,b). Fig. 2(c) shows the cross sectional image of CFTS coated on FTO glass, the thickness of CFTS particles ranges from 70 to 150 nm thick. By using nonpolar solvent such as toluene, the CFTS nanoparticles were well dispersed. The spin coating condition was optimized with 1000 rpm for 20 s. The spin coating was repeated for 7 times in order to obtain the optimum film thickness and in turn better catalytic effect as shown in the cyclic voltammogram (see Fig. 5).
Cell performance of CFTS and Pt is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. Photovoltaic performances with each counter electrode are quite comparable to each other except the Voc value.

As per the eqn (1) and (2), an open circuit voltage (Voc) of the cell depends on the concentration of I3− ions present in the electrolyte system. When compared to the Pt based conventional counter electrode, lower catalytic effect of CFTS material showed lesser degree of reduction of I3− ions into 3I− ions. Thus the lower performance of CFTS electrode showed higher concentration of I3− ions than that of the Pt based counter electrode. The higher concentration of I3− ions leads to the Voc drop as per the eqn (1). In the case of conventional Pt counter electrode, the reduction process is more effective thus the leaving behind the lower concentration of I3− ions in turn higher Voc value was obtained. From the cyclic voltammogram, the lower cathodic current was observed in the region of −0.3 to 0.2 V for CFTS electrode which infers the lower cathodic performance and also causes the Voc drop.
From the J–V curve (see Fig. 3), there is an increasing trend of fill factor has been observed for the CuS and CuSnS type materials depending on the valence state of the copper cations. For example, CuS and CuSnS3 having +2 valence state of copper ion shows higher fill factor value than the Cu2S and Cu2SnS4 having lower valence (+1) state of copper ions. The higher fill factor of CuS and CuSnS3 may be due to the more positive valence state of copper ion which causes good bonding tendency towards the anionic counterpart and in turn the whole compound is chemically more stable than the Cu2S and Cu2SnS4.
Also, CFTS type DSSC shows a lower fill factor value than that of Pt type DSSC. In order to understand the reason, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was done to characterize the cell resistance as shown in Fig. 4. The noticeable semiarc which is the first semi-arc (Rct1) indicates that the resistances at the interface of counter electrode/electrolyte in a CFTS type DSSC (0.16 Ω) is slightly smaller than that of a Pt type DSSC (0.24 Ω).
This is because a CFTS type DSSC has a smaller resistance at the above interface than a Pt type DSSC. This chalcogenide EIS data which indicated a small Rct1 in SnS nanosheets type DSSC was recently demonstrated in a SnSx counter electrode based DSSC paper. Also, The Rs of a CFTS CE is 1.65 Ω, smaller than that of a Pt CE (1.80 Ω), which means that a CFTS CE has a faster electron transfer kinetics and better electrical conductivity than a Pt CE, and is also consistent with the tendency of the observed Jsc in Fig. 3.
The IPCE spectra of CFTS and Pt electrodes are shown in the ESI (see Fig. S2(a)). The CFTS based cell showed a slightly higher EQE value than the Pt counter electrode based conventional cell in the wavelength region of 300–800 nm. To understand this phenomenon, the normalized ΔEQE of both the cells were also plotted for the whole wave length region as shown in Fig S2(b). The relationship between the photocurrent density (Jsc)and the Rs is expressed as follows
(3)
where
Iph is the photocurrent, I0 is the saturated current under dark, q is the electric charge, Isc is the short-circuit current, Rs is the series resistance, A is the electrode area, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Rsh is the shunt resistance.

Though the same N719 dye has been used for both the cells (CFTS and Pt based counter electrodes), the same Iph should be observed for both the cases. However, the Rs value of the CFTS based cell was little bit smaller than the Pt based conventional cell. As per the eqn (3), the lower Rs value of the CFTS cell influence the higher Jsc value than that of the Pt based cell. The higher Jsc value was also observed in the J–V curve (see Fig. 3). The CFTS based cell showed a higher Jsc value of around 0.5 mA cm−2 than the Pt based cells. The higher Jsc value was also observed in the J–V curve (see Fig. 3).
The catalytic activities of the samples were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 5, the CEs based on the CFTS nanoparticles and Pt showed comparable shapes in terms of redox peak positions and current densities. The primary reduction/oxidation peaks for the Pt and the CFTS nanoparticles appeared at 0.518 V/0.547 V and 0.473 V/0.677 V. reduction potential, respectively. Overall estimating both potentials of reduction peaks and oxidation peaks, the catalytic ability of CFTS was comparable to Pt.

In summary, we have reported facile, cost effective application of chalcogenide nanoparticles, CFTS which was used as a counter electrode with catalytic effect. The CFTS-based DSSC showed cell efficiency comparable to a Pt-based CE. This work provides us with a demonstration of a low-cost, Pt-free, earth abundant element CE material for DSSC. This new material, CFTS will boost up to lower the cost of DSSC and shorten necessary time period to apply outdoors in real life.
