In this work, we used poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, PH 1000) and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) as anode and hole transport materials, respectively, for fabricating metal oxide-free inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) anode was reduced to 76 Ω sq−1 after treatment with ethylene glycol and phosphoric acid, a level comparable to that of conventional indium tin oxide. The hydrophobicity of PTAA improved the perovskite crystallization, facilitating performance improvements in the PSCs. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.23% was achieved for these structured rigid PSCs on a rigid glass substrate, with the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor of 19.88 mA cm−2, 1.02 V, and 70.2%, respectively. Flexible PSCs on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate exhibited a high PCE of 10.51% with excellent bendability. Our results indicate that using anodes of PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) and hole transport layers of PTAA presents a promising fabrication method for high-performance rigid and flexible metal oxide-free PSCs, which suggests future large-scale and roll-to-roll production.

With the emergence of hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), increasing research attention has focused on these new photovoltaic devices because they offer specific advantages. PSCs have earned high popularity with characteristic properties including light weight, low cost, simple fabrication, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE, over 22%). However, PSCs suffer from many flaws, such as low stability and flexibility, which are widely considered to hinder commercial applicability.

Typically, conventionally structured PSCs are fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass with TiO2 as the electron transport material. For this kind of PSC, sintering the TiO2 layer usually requires a very high temperature reaching 500 °C, which restricts commercialization. To lower the fabrication temperature, inverted PSCs have been rapidly developed; these are usually fabricated on indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with low-temperature-processed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylenethiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the hole and electron transport materials, respectively. However, in both kinds of PSCs, metal oxide electrodes of FTO or ITO must be used because of their high transparency and conductivity. The rigid and fragile nature of these metal oxide electrodes limits the fabrication of flexible PSCs. Thus, it is very important to develop new materials as electrodes and charge-transport layers to enable mechanical flexibility and improve the long-term stability of PSCs. Recently, various conductive materials have been investigated as replacements for conventional metal oxide-based electrodes. For example, silver nanowires, metallic grids, graphene, and carbon nanotubes have been used as anodes for fabricating inverted PSCs with good flexibility; they showed PCEs of 7.9–14.2%. As a highly conductive organic material, PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) is widely used as an anode material for fabricating organic solar cells with comparable performances to ITO-based cells. In PSCs, Sun et al. used PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) as an anode for inverted PSCs that showed PCEs of 10.6% and 8.1% for rigid and flexible devices, respectively. Li et al. reported a hybrid PEDOT:PSS/silver mesh anode and fabricated flexible inverted PSCs with a high PCE of 14.0%. In these studies, the device structure of substrate/PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000)/PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083)/perovskite/PCBM/cathode was utilized, in which PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) was used as the hole transport layer between the anode and perovskite layers. However, the hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS is disadvantageous for the crystallization and stability of the upper perovskite layers, which may cause the relatively low performances of the PSCs in these works. To overcome this challenge, other types of hole transport materials were intensively studied to improve the performance of PSCs. Poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) is a better candidate for hole transport in PSCs compared to PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083). Huang et al. demonstrated that the hydrophobic nature of PTAA promoted perovskite crystallization and stabilization, with the PCE of PSCs based on ITO electrodes improving from 12.3% to 18.1%. However, the use of PTAA in metal oxide-free PSCs has not yet been reported. Considering the superior performance of PTAA and different properties of flexible PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) electrodes compared to rigid ITO-based ones, it is very important to investigate the use of PTAA as the hole transport material in metal oxide-free PSCs.
Here, we report the fabrication of metal oxide-free PSCs based on highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) and PTAA as the anode and hole transport materials, respectively. We found that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) was dramatically enhanced from 0.3 to 14570 mS cm−1 after treatment with ethylene glycol (EG) and phosphoric acid (PA), enabling a high capacity for charge collection. We also found that the quality of the perovskite film was enhanced by using PTAA as a hole transport layer, with enlarged grain sizes and improved crystallinity. Based on this configuration, a high average PCE of 14.23% was achieved for rigid PSCs on glass substrates, which was only 9.2% lower than the 15.67% PCE of ITO-based PSCs. Moreover, the long-term stability of the PSCs was significantly improved by 13.3% compared to that of PSCs using PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer. This was attributed to the hydrophobic nature of PTAA, which may reduce the exposure of the perovskite layer to moisture. The flexible PSCs on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate exhibited a high PCE of 10.51%, which was 25.9% higher than that of previously reported PSCs. Moreover, our flexible PSCs showed good bendability with a PCE degradation of only 22.8% after 500 bending cycles. Our results indicate that using PEDOT:PSS and PTAA to fabricate metal oxide-free PSCs is an effective way to realize large-scale and roll-to-roll production of PSCs in the future.


Fig. 1(a) shows the device structure of the inverted oxide-free PSC, which can be established on a rigid (glass) or a flexible (PEN) substrate. The PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) electrode can be fabricated by a solution method, which is easier and lower in energy consumption compared to the sputtering method used to fabricate ITO electrodes. Fig. 1(b) shows the energy level of each layer in the PSC. The high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, −1.8 eV) and the low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, −5.14 eV) indicate the excellent hole-extraction and effective electron-blocking properties of PTAA. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), the ultraviolet (UV) photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results show that the work function of the PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) electrode is −5.07 eV, slightly higher than that of PTAA, which is unfavorable for hole transportation. After combination with the highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) anode, the performance of this device is comparable with that of traditional inverted PSCs, as discussed later.

Before the fabrication of PSCs, a highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) anode must be prepared by solution methods. The pristine PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) has the low sheet resistance (Rs) of approximately 427 kΩ sq−1 without any special treatment. To reduce the Rs, we added 5 wt% EG to a PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) solution for spin coating and obtained a film (EG-PEDOT:PSS, PH 1000) with a lower Rs of 1192 Ω sq−1, similar to that reported in previous studies, as shown in Table 1. At the same time, employing EG slightly reduced the film thickness from 78 to 75 nm, possibly because of the dilution effect of the EG solvent. To further reduce the Rs, a PA treatment was used to obtain an electrode (PA-EG-PEDOT:PSS, PH 1000) with the final Rs of 76 Ω sq−1, following previous work. Although PA can enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) further, the film thickness is decreased by 9.3% compared with EG-diluted PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000).

As can be observed from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase images in Fig. 2(a), the bare PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) film shows a rough surface with bright and dark domains corresponding to PEDOT and PSS aggregates, respectively. After PA treatment, the phase composition of the film becomes homogeneous with a reduced phase distribution, as shown in Fig. 2(b), which is in good agreement with data obtained from previous work. This may be due to the transfer of protons from PA to PSS− in the PEDOT:PSS film. Because PSS is hydrophilic, some is removed by the washing process. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), the AFM height images show a similar trend to the phase images (Fig. 2). The surface of the PEDOT:PSS film became smoother after PA treatment with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness decease from 3.45 to 3.31 nm, which can be explained by the removal of PSS. After coating with PTAA, the surface became rougher, with an RMS roughness increase from 3.31 to 3.38 nm. The hydrophobic PEDOT in the PSS-removed regions may improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. After coating with PTAA, the surface exhibits a texture featuring enhanced domain sizes compared to that of PEDOT:PSS, as shown in Fig. 2(c). This increase in the domain size may arise from the aggregation of PTAA. This surface morphology of PTAA is similar to those of PTAA layers on other substrates.
To obtain evidence for the superiority of PTAA, we characterized the quality of the perovskite layers on PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) and PTAA using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the perovskite on PTAA shows fewer pinholes and more closely-packed grains with the average grain size enhanced from 200 to 300 nm, compared to that on PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083). The XRD results in Fig. 3(c) show enhanced perovskite characteristic peaks at 14.1° and 28.4°, indicating the improved crystallinity of the perovskite on PTAA compared to that on PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083), which is consistent with previous studies. Moreover, a peak at around 12.5° can be observed in both cases, which corresponds to the (001) lattice planes of hexagonal PbI2. Previous studies demonstrated that the excess PbI2 in the perovskite films could effectively passivate surface defects, which is beneficial for the performance of PSCs. Furthermore, the UV-visible absorption spectra in Fig. S3 (ESI) exhibited that the perovskite layer based on the PTAA film showed enhanced absorption compared to that on the PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) film. This improved absorption indicates that the perovskite film on top of PTAA had better crystallinity from another parameter. Fig. S4 (ESI) shows that the contact angle on PTAA (95°) was larger than that (15°) on PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083), indicating the hydrophobicity of PTAA. Previous studies indicated that hydrophobic underlayers promoted the crystal growth of perovskite, isolating perovskite nuclei from each other. The grain-boundary expansion rate of the perovskite on PTAA is higher than that on PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083), finally resulting in the larger grain size. Thus, using PTAA is more advantageous for the upper perovskite formation than using PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083). Large grain sizes benefit the transfer of excitons in the perovskite film, thus reducing the probability of exciton quenching at grain boundaries and thereby improving photovoltaic performance.
To understand the hole extraction properties of PTAA and PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083), we measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the bare perovskite, perovskite on PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083), and perovskite on PTAA. From Fig. 4(a), an obvious quenching effect can be observed for the PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083)- and PTAA-based samples at the wavelengths of 778 and 775 nm, respectively, confirming the extraction and transportation of carriers. However, the signal from the perovskite on PTAA is 5.2% lower than that from the perovskite on PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083), indicating the improved charge extraction properties of PTAA, which has similar trends as the rigid ITO-based PSCs. Moreover, a blue shift of the PL peak (from 778 to 775 nm) verifies that the perovskite film coated on PTAA has a larger grain size and better crystallinity than that on the PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) substrate. As shown in Fig. 4(b), after bi-exponential fitting of the TRPL spectra, the PL lifetimes of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083)/perovskite and PTAA/perovskite are 166 and 142 ns, respectively. The PL lifetime of PTAA/perovskite is 14.5% shorter than that of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083)/perovskite, further indicating the improved hole extraction properties of PTAA. This can be explained by the energy levels shown in Fig. 1(b): the LUMO of PTAA is closer to that of perovskite than that of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) is.
Based on the above analysis, we fabricated PSC devices and compared the performances of the PSCs with the structures of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083)/perovskite/PCBM/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Ag and glass/ITO/PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag. All the J–V characteristics of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 5(b) and photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The latter PSC using PTAA as the hole transport layer exhibits a high PCE of 15.67%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 20.15 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 74.1%. The PCE of the PTAA-based PSCs is 15.8% higher than that (13.53%) of the PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083)-based ones, in good agreement with the results from a previous study. We note that the improved Jsc may arise from the enhanced perovskite crystallinity, which can absorb more sunlight and transfer charges more easily. At the same time, the HOMO of PTAA is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083) and the LUMO of PTAA (−1.8 eV) is high enough to efficiently block electrons.

Moreover, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI), we also found that the stability of the PSCs using PTAA was much higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083)-based PSCs, with PCE degradation reduced from 25.2 to 15.1% after 150 hours of storage under ambient conditions (25 °C, humidity of ∼20–30%). This was probably caused by the hydrophobic properties of PTAA, which more effectively blocked moisture from the air and finally enhanced the stability of the perovskite film (see Fig. S4, ESI). For the PSC using PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083), the perovskite layer is rapidly destroyed because of the hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS.
Based on the above discussion, we conclude that using PTAA as the hole transport layer permits significant improvements to PSCs. Then, we fabricated metal oxide-free PSCs using highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) as the anode to further verify the superior performance of PTAA, using the layer sequence shown in Fig. 1(a). The layer-by-layer structure of the PSCs can be observed in the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 5(a), with the thicknesses of PTAA, perovskite, and PCBM of approximately 10, 400, and 80 nm, respectively, found by SEM; the layers showed good interfacial connection in our PSCs. After completing the fabrication of devices, the related performance was tested under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) illumination. The PTAA-based metal oxide-free PSCs show an average PCE of 14.23%, with a Voc, Jsc and FF of 1.02 V, 19.88 mA cm−2, and 70.2%, respectively. From the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in Fig. 5(c), the calculated Jsc of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083), ITO/PTAA, PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000)/PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083) and PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000)/PTAA based PSCs is 18.73 mA cm−2, 19.59 mA cm−2, 17.86 mA cm−2 and 19.38 mA cm−2, respectively. These values are only around 2.5% lower than that obtained from the J–V measurement in Fig. 5(b), indicating the high reliability of our measurements. The relatively lower IPCE at 650–750 nm might be caused by the contact resistance and/or uncontrollable defects in the PSCs. The PCE of the metal oxide-free PSCs is only 9.2% lower than the 15.67% PCE of ITO-based PSCs, which is attributed to the 1.3% lower Jsc and 5.2% lower FF. These may arise from the relatively higher Rs of PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000, 76 Ω sq−1) compared to that of ITO (15 Ω sq−1). However, the PCE of our PTAA-based metal oxide-free PSCs is higher than that reported in a previous study using PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) as the hole transport material, which can be attributed to the improved perovskite quality and hole extraction properties.
To research the applicability on flexible substrates, we fabricated PSCs with the structure of PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000)/PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/Ag on PEN substrates, using the same fabrication process and effective working area. As shown in Fig. 6(a), our device fabricated on a soft substrate exhibits excellent performance, with a PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF of 10.51%, 18.32 mA cm−2, 0.97 V, and 59.2%, respectively. This PCE is only 26.1% lower than that of the rigid device, which is similar to the results reported in previous work. However, it is higher than that of flexible PSCs using PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083) as the hole transport layer. The relative reduction in the PCE may be caused by the rougher surface of the PEN film and higher series resistance of the flexible device. Although the uniform spin-coating of layers on a flexible layer such as PEN is more difficult than that on a rigid layer, the use of flexible substrates can dramatically decrease the weight of PSCs and permit roll-to-roll production. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the flexibility test with a bending radius of approximately 3 mm exhibits the degradation tendencies of the PSC. After a test of 500 bending cycles, the samples retain a PCE of 8.11%, showing a degradation of 22.8%, which is slightly lower than that in a previous study. This degradation is consistent with the 21.5% decrease in Jsc. It is reported that bending can cause crack formation from the rigid parts (perovskite and ITO), rather than from the flexible parts including PEDOT:PSS or PTAA. In this study, microscale cracks may form in the perovskite layer after the bending test, hindering exciton transport, which may cause the degradation of Jsc. The 22.8% degradation in the PCE of our flexible devices is lower than that (26.7%) of the previously reported flexible device using PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI 4083) as the hole transport layer. Our results indicate that the use of PTAA as a hole transport layer in the inverted PSCs is promising for the fabrication of flexible PSCs, which are suitable for future roll-to-roll production and flexible applications.

In summary, we fabricated metal oxide-free PSCs using EG- and PA-treated PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) as the anode and PTAA as the hole transport layer. After the treatments with EG and PA, the Rs of PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) was significantly reduced from 427 kΩ sq−1 to 76 Ω sq−1, which is comparable to that of the traditional ITO electrode. The SEM and XRD results indicated the improved perovskite quality induced by the use of PTAA. The PL measurement and work function alignments indicated the superior photoelectric performance of PTAA, compared to that of PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083). As a result, the rigid PSCs (on glass substrates) with PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) and PTAA exhibited an average PCE of 14.23% without significant hysteresis, which is comparable to that of metal oxide-based PSCs. Moreover, the PCE degradation of PSCs using PTAA was reduced by 13.1% after long-term storage, compared to that of PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083)-based devices. The flexible PSCs (on PEN substrates) showed a high PCE of 10.51% and excellent bendability. Our results demonstrate that our method shows high potential for future large-scale roll-to-roll industrial production of PSCs.


The PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH 1000, Germany) aqueous solution was mixed with 5 wt% EG (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as a pretreatment. The pre-treated PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) aqueous solution was deposited on pre-cleaned glass or PEN substrates (Ying Kou You Xuan Trade Co., Ltd, China) by a spin-coating method at a speed of 1000 rpm for 60 s in air to form a uniform film. After that, the PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) films were dried at 140 °C for 15 min to fully remove the remaining solvent. After cooling to room temperature (25 °C), the samples were dipped into a PA solution (85 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 120 °C for 3 min. Then, the samples were removed and washed with deionized water three times.


The PSCs were fabricated on the PEDOT:PSS coated glass or PEN substrates with a structure of PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000)/PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083) or PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag. The PbI2 solution was prepared by dissolving 462 mg of PbI2 in 1 mL of a co-solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide:dimethylformamide (1:10 v/v ratio) under stirring at 70 °C. The prepared PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS (PVP AI 4083) or PTAA layer at a speed of 4500 rpm for 30 s. After spin-coating, the film was heated at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, 200 μL of 0.38 M CH3NH3I solution (dissolved in isopropanol (IPA)) was dripped on the PbI2 coated substrate with 20 s loading time and spin-coated at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. After that, the samples were baked at 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, PCBM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the perovskite layers at a speed of 1000 rpm for 30 s. Then, BCP (0.5 mg mL−1 in IPA) was spin-coated onto the PCBM layers at a speed of 4500 rpm for 30 s. At last, Ag electrodes were thermally evaporated onto the samples under a vacuum of <8.0 × 10−6 Torr with a thickness of about 100 nm. The effective working area of our PSCs was 0.1 cm2, as defined by a shadow mask.


The conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured using a four-point probe system with a current source-meter (Keithley 2400, USA). The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS films was determined using a surface profilometer (KLA Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ, USA). The phase images of the films were obtained in air using AFM (Veeco, USA) in tapping-mode. The UPS was recorded using a Kratos Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Kratos Analytical, UK). The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images were obtained using a JSM-7500F Field Emission SEM (JOEL, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. PL and TRPL spectra were measured using a spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). The J–V curves of PSCs were measured under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The IPCE of the PSCs was measured using a Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (Solar Cell Scan 100, Zolix, China). The XRD patterns were obtained by using a Bruker D8 Advance XRD Instrument (Germany).
