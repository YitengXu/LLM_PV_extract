In the past two years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells has significantly increased up to 20.1%. These state-of-the-art new devices surpass other third-generation solar cells to become the most promising rival to the silicon-based solar cells. Since the morphology of the perovskite film is one of the most crucial factors to affect the performance of the device, many approaches have been developed for its improvement. This review provides a systematical summary of the methods for morphology control. Introductions and discussions on the mechanisms and relevant hotspots are also given. Understanding the growth process of perovskite crystallites has great benefits for further efficiency improvement and enlightens us to exploit new technologies for large-scale, low-cost and high-performance perovskite solar cells.

Lixin Xiao is a professor of the Department of Physics, Peking University (China) since 2011. He received his PhD in applied chemistry from The University of Tokyo (Japan) in 2000. He has been working on organic optoelectronics materials and devices, especially on photovoltaic (PV) and organic light-emitting devices (OLED).

During the past two decades, inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite was investigated enthusiastically due to its excellent optical and electronic properties. Hybrid perovskite has the formula ABX3, where X is usually a halogen ion (I−, Br−, Cl−), A is an organic ammonium ion (e.g. CH3NH3+, NHCHNH3+) and B is Pb2+ or Sn2+ (Fig. 1). The corners of the cube are occupied by the small organic cations; therefore, a three-dimensional (3D) framework could form with the arrays of the corner-sharing metal halide octahedra, resulting in a narrow band gap. For example, the most popular CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx have a direct band gap of ∼1.55 eV, which corresponds to an absorption onset of 800 nm and intense absorption of the entire visible region. By regulating the ions, tunable properties can be obtained with extended absorption in the near-infrared region. Moreover, the exciton binding energy of these perovskites is very small compared to that of organic semiconductors, corresponding to the long exciton diffusion length of 100–1000 nm and lifetime of ∼100 ns. All these advantages display a great potential of the hybrid perovskite as a light absorber for new-generation solar cells.

Although it was discovered decades ago, perovskite was first used as the light absorber for liquid dye-sensitized solar cells in 2009 by Miyasaka et al. with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 3.8%. The PCE and the device stability were significantly enhanced by replacing the liquid hole transporting material (HTM) with solid 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) to avoid the dissolution of the perovskite. In 2012, a solid-state mesoscopic solar cell based on CH3NH3PbI3 by a solution process was fabricated with a PCE of 9.7%. Snaith et al. increased the PCE to 10.9% by replacing the mesoporous TiO2 with Al2O3 as a scaffold. They also successfully fabricated the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without a mesoporous layer via the careful morphology optimizion. Grätzel et al. exploited a two-step sequential deposition method that demonstrated a very uniform morphology as well as a high PCE of above 15%. Y. Yang et al. reported a planar PSC with a PCE of 19.3% using the efficient interface engineering technology. Recently, the certified PCE of PSC has been boosted up to 20%, which is the most promising rival to silicon-based solar cells (Fig. 1).
One of the most crucial issues for PSCs is the morphology control of the perovskite film. Many photo-physical properties, such as light harvesting, charge carrier transport and diffusion length, can be dramatically affected by the crystallization of the perovskite. The defects and the crystal grain boundaries of the perovskite crystallites act as the traps of carriers, which aggravate the charge recombination. The hysteresis effect, which causes inaccuracy in evaluating cell efficiency, is also believed to be related to the crystallinity and interfaces of the perovskite. Thus, the device performance strongly depends on the morphology of the perovskite film.
Two architectures of PSCs have been researched most commonly: the meso-structured device and the planar device (Fig. 2). The growth process of perovskite crystallites in these two types of devices differs greatly. The meso-structured device generally employs a layer of hundred-nanometer-thick mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3 as the scaffold; thus, the crystallization of the perovskite greatly benefits from the enhanced nucleation at the mesostructure surface. The pore filling and the homogeneity of the perovskite layer are concerns for this architecture during the film formation; moreover, a capping layer of perovskite with suitable thickness on the mesoscopic structure was verified to be beneficial for the device performance. The planar device has a p-i-n junction, in which the perovskite is directly deposited on a compact n-type inorganic oxide or p-type PEDOT:PSS film covered by a solid organic HTM or fullerene electron acceptor, respectively. Owing to its simpler structure, the high-temperature (500 °C) sintering process is no longer necessary for the planar architecture, which seems to be more attractive for practical applications. However, it becomes a challenge to control the morphology of the perovskite films due to the lack of a scaffold. A fully covered dense layer of perovskite with a large crystal grain size is very important for planar devices to gain efficient light absorption and reduce energy loss in the charge transport and collection processes.
According to the architectures, diverse film formation technologies, including one-step spin-coating deposition, sequential deposition method, two-step spin-coating deposition and vapor deposition, were developed for efficient PSCs. In this review, we systematically summarize and compare the morphology control methods for the perovskite crystallites by different film formation technologies. Many key studies and findings are highlighted and discussed. A comprehensive understanding of the nucleation and growth process of perovskite crystallites will guide us to further optimize the morphology and the efficiency of PSCs. In addition, the present studies on crystallite growth will enlighten us to master the morphology control of the perovskite film in large-scale applications and explore new practical methods for large-scale, low-cost and high-performance PSCs.

The one-step spin-coating method (Fig. 3) involves the spin coating of a precursor solution of lead halide with a certain amount of an organic ammonium halide. Furthermore, the perovskite crystallites form and grow during the solvent evaporation. A post-annealing process at a relatively high temperature (around 100 °C) is usually required for the complete crystallization of the perovskite and the removal of the residual solvents. For this method, the film morphology and photovoltaic performance are very sensitive to the conditions and treatment, such as the annealing temperature, solution concentration, precursor composition and solvent choice.

In general, CH3NH3PbI3 is obtained from a solution containing stoichiometric PbI2 and methylammonium iodine (MAI), while CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, is obtained from nonstoichiometric PbCl2 and MAI with a molar ratio of 1:3. Due to the higher formation energy of Cl-substituted MAPbI3 than that of the triiodine type, the concentration of Cl− is very low in the resultant perovskite. The excess MAI can guarantee that the molar ratio of Pb2+ and halide is 1:3, since the redundant halide and methylammonium can evaporate during the annealing process. Many beneficial properties can be obtained using mixed halides. For instance, the carrier diffusion length of MAPbI3−xClx reaches 1000 nm, which is almost 10 times of that of MAPbI3. In addition, it was found that better moisture stability can be realized by incorporating Br− and I−.
Solvents (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL)), in which both lead halides and organic ammonium halides have good solubility, are frequently chosen for the device fabrication. It was found that MAPbI3 from a GBL solution preferred to form the clustered-domain morphology, while the interconnected needle-like crystalline morphology was observed from a DMF precursor solution (Fig. 4a and b). Both the films exhibited sparse surface coverage on the planar substrates without mesoscopic structures. However, the surface coverage is one of the most crucial factors that dominate the performance of planar devices, and an efficient PSC can be attained only with high surface coverage. The incomplete surface coverage of perovskite not only decreases the harvest of light by passing straight though the device, but also brings a lot of pinholes as shunt paths for the direct contacts of the HTM and electron transporting layer (ETL). All these cause simultaneous drops in the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and the corresponding PCE. H. J. Snaith et al. first confirmed the feasibility of forming a perovskite film with nearly full coverage on a planar substrate by carefully controlling the annealing conditions. It was demonstrated that the pores and the poor coverage increase with crystal agglomeration and dewetting during annealing, which are driven by the evaporation of the solvent and mass. The evaporation rate can be slowed down under a relatively low annealing temperature of about 90 °C on a film of 450–550 nm, and under these circumstances improved surface coverage was attained, which corresponds to a high PCE of 11.4% for MAPbI3−xClx based PSCs (Fig. 4c). The phenomenon of coverage reduction with increasing annealing temperature was also observed by R. Tena-Zaere et al. Y.-J. Hsu et al. fabricated perovskite on a preheated NiOx substrate at a very high spinning speed to accelerate solvent evaporation and crystal formation, which can reduce the coarsening of the crystals. As a result, surface coverage changed from 89% to 93% when the spinning speed increased from 8000 rpm to 9500 rpm. The sensitive dependence of crystal growth on the environment upon annealing was investigated by Y. Yang and C. Surya et al. An appropriately humid environment (about 30%) provides a small amount of moisture within the grain boundaries, which helps grain boundary creep and the grain merge, giving rise to a film with reduced pinholes and large crystal grains beyond 500 nm. This method produced planar devices with the highest PCE of 17.1% based on the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PC61BM/PFN/Al. In addition to the annealing conditions, preheating the substrate before spin coating, rapidly quenching after annealing at high temperatures and a detailed temperature raising procedure, are also available to enhance surface coverage and form void-free perovskite films on planar substrates.
Noting that the annealing process includes the conversion to perovskite, the effects of the annealing temperature on the composition of the resultant film should also be investigated. For MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx, the conversion to perovskite requires a minimum temperature of 80 °C. The conversion of MAPbI3 can be as fast as 10 min at 100 °C, whereas MAPbI3−xClx needs at least 45 min for sublimating the excessive mass. Many literature applied 100 °C or above as the annealing temperature instead of a lower temperature at which the coverage would be better, this might due to the much longer time required for the conversion at low temperatures. Formamidinium lead triiodine (FAPbI3) needs a much higher annealing temperature of above 150 °C for a pure crystal phase and good device performance. Thus, the selected temperature should be defined by the optimized surface morphology as well as the full conversion and crystallization of perovskite.
The use of additives in the precursor solution can effectively control the film formation process. K. Zhu et al. added MACl to the standard MAPbI3 precursor solution, and found that pure MAPbI3 were formed with improved coverage and absorption on a planar substrate. As a result, the PCE increased from 2% to 12% for the planar cells and from 8% to 10% for the mesostructured cells. The mechanism was due to the existence of MACl, which slows down the crystallization of MAPbI3 by producing some intermediate crystal structures, so the large elongated crystals turned into small crystals with a high surface coverage. Interestingly, after enough annealing time, no MACl was detected by EDX analysis, indicating that all the Cl was sublimated and pure MAPbI3 was formed. L. Ding et al. also confirmed the role of the ammonium chloride species using MACl and NH4Cl as the additives, and a better performance was achieved using NH4Cl to form a smoother film (Fig. 4d). Bidentate halogenated alkanes as another type of additives were developed to manipulate the crystallization rate of perovskite by temporarily chelating with Pb2+ and releasing iodide during the thermal annealing. A PCE of 12% was obtained from the p-i-n junction of PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PC61BM by adding a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), which can be attributed to a more uniform and continuous surface. Further optimizations were done on the alkyl chain length and the end halogens. S. H. Im mixed HBr and H2O in DMF to increase the solvent solubility of MAPbBr3 so that crystallization can be initiated at a higher concentration, leading to a denser crystal layer with a high surface coverage. An impressive PCE of 10.4% with a high Voc of 1.51 V was achieved for MAPbBr3 PSCs without significant hysteresis effects using a well-matched hole-transporting polymer.Table 1 shows a summary of the reported additives and their performances.

Although the coverage problem can be circumvented by the variable methods mentioned above, another challenge of the planar architecture is the balance of light absorption and charge collection efficiency. In addition, the films should be thick enough for sufficient light absorption to gain a high photogenerated current. Moreover, if the film is much thicker than the diffusion length of the carrier, the charges would hardly reach the ETL or HTL interface to be collected, leading to a very low charge collection efficiency and FF. Computational studies attested that the performance of planar devices is strongly influenced by the thickness and defect density of the perovskite film. A solar cell with a p-i-n of spiro-OMeTAD/MAPbI3/TiO2 was employed to investigate the effects of thickness using the AMPS-1D simulation program. Based on a constant charge mobility of 50 cm2 V−1 s−1, as the thickness was increased from 200 nm to 1000 nm, the calculated Jsc increased from 19.0 to 23.6 mA cm−2 without obvious loss of Voc. However, in the experiment, most of the planar devices could not perform well when the thickness reached the diffusion length of perovskite (MAPbI3−xClx calculated as 1000 nm). This might be attributed to the massive charge traps produced during the crystal growth, which seriously stems the charge transport. The effect of the defect density on the device performance was also simulated, and the results demonstrated that increasing the defect density in the bulk perovskite or interface would severely decrease the Voc and PCE. Hence, grain boundaries, which are always known as the enrichment regions of charge traps, should be eliminated across the carrier transport path. Furthermore, to expand the threshold thickness of the device as well as the charge mobility of the charge carriers, perovskite crystallites with a large grain size should be formed, so that the carriers would need to pass through a least number of grain boundaries before collection.
Moreover, technologies aimed at the formation of a dense layer of large perovskite crystallites without reducing surface coverage are highly desired. Based on this purpose, a fast deposition-crystallization (FDC) method was proposed by L. Spiccia and Y.-B. Cheng. In this approach, wet films from a standard MAPbI3 solution were quickly exposed to a second poor solvent (chlorobenzene, toluene) of perovskite, followed by the DMF solvent extracted by the second solvent. Because of the rapidly reduced solubility of MAPbI3 in the film, the supersaturation status drove quick uniform nucleation before the rapid growth of the crystal, and a high-quality film of uniform micron-size grains with full surface coverage was produced (Fig. 4e). Subsequently, they reported a hot gas flow treatment, which can also realize the supersaturation status at the early stage of crystallization. As seen from the SEM shown (Fig. 4f), no grain boundaries parallel to the substrate was observed in a 350 nm-thick film by this method, which indicates the efficient carrier transport. S. I. Seok et al. developed a solvent-engineering technology, which is suitable for both the planar and meso-structured devices. The mixed solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and GBL was used for the precursor and toluene was dripped onto the film during the spin-coating process. When toluene was introduced, a plate intermediate phase of MAI-PbI2-DMSO was formed and finally got converted to the perovskite phase. The solid-state conversion mechanism refrained the crystals from over agglomeration during growth, yielding extremely uniform and flat films, whose morphology is quite similar to that formed by the FDC method (Fig. 4g). It can be noted that the hysteresis effects in the devices fabricated by the FDC method or solvent-engineering technology attenuated obviously, revealing what a promising morphology should be like.
Quite recently, A. D. Mohite proposed a solution-based hot-casting technique, and millimeter-scale leaf-like MAPbI3−xClx single crystals were successfully produced to form a pinhole-free film (Fig. 4h). This technique utilizes a hot (70 °C) precursor solution of equivalent PbI2 and MACl, which is spin coated on a hot substrate kept at a temperature of 180 °C. Because the substrate temperature is much higher than the crystallization temperature, excess solvent prolongs the crystals growth yielding crystals with the grain size of 1–2 mm. Hysteresis-free cells based on a PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/PCBM junction reached a PCE of 18%. The PCE is only 9.1% when devices with small grains are fabricated by a relatively low substrate temperature. Self-consistent optoelectronic simulation was performed to investigate the reasons for the performance improvement. For the small-grain device, the recombination mainly came from the bulk defects. When large-grain crystals were introduced, this part of the recombination was remarkably suppressed. Different recombination processes were found in these two devices: for the large-grain device, the dominant bimolecular recombination process represented high crystalline quality; for the small-grain device, trap-assisted recombination was observed. The conclusion was attested by the experimental results of time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, the correlation between the mobility and the grain size was proposed. The mobility increased sharply with the crystal grain size, and for a 170 μm-size grain, the mobility can be as high as 20 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Compared to the planar architecture, the meso-structured devices did not suffer much from the coverage problem and rigid limitation of the device thickness, because the film formation was considerably improved and the carrier-collection efficiency can reach higher than 99% by taking advantage of the mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3. Instead, pore filling is an important issue for the meso-structured architecture, which is dominated by the thickness of the mesoporous layer and the quantity of the perovskite deposited. Therefore, a high concentration of the precursor solution (40 wt% for MAPbI3, or 0.88 M PbCl2 + 2.64 M MAI for MAPbI3−xClx) is usually used with an adjusted thickness (300–400 nm) of the mesoporous layer. Among the meso-structured devices, the best performance always come from those with a compact perovskite completely covered on the mesostructure and full pore filling. The highest PCE of 16.7% was obtained from an MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 device with a capping layer by the solvent-engineering technology. Due to the coexistence of the compact perovskite capping layer and the mp-TiO2 (Al2O3)/perovskite nanocomposite, the morphology control method that is used for the planar device can also be utilized for this architecture. S. I. Seok et al. stabilized the crystal phase and modified the morphology of FAPbI3 by incorporating 15% MAPbBr3 (Fig. 4i). Low-gap FAPbI3 offers a high Jsc and MAPbBr3 offers a large Voc in the mesostructured cell based on (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, yielding a high PCE of 18.4%. Effective interface modification can be a useful method to control the crystal growth in the mesoscopic devices. S. Hayase et al. inserted an HOCO-R-NH3+I− monolayer between porous TiO2 and perovskite. By anchoring TiO2 and perovskite with COOH− and NH3+, HOCO-R-NH3+I− passivates the surface traps of TiO2 and helps the formation of large perovskite crystals. HOCO-R-NH3+I− can also work as a dopant in MAPbI3 by which a hole-conductor-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cell reached a high PCE of 12.8% with excellent stability.

A new route, namely, sequential deposition method, for fabricating PSCs was proposed by Grätzel et al. with an impressively high PCE of 15% (Fig. 3). This route involves firstly, the spin-coating of a lead halide on a substrate, followed by drying, then dipping the precursor film into a solution of organoammonium halide to accomplish the conversion in a minute (to differentiate from the other two-step method, the sequential deposition method in this review specifically represents the spin-coating then dipping method). Usually, a solution of 1 M PbI2 in DMF is used to fabricate the precursor film and 10 mg mL−1 or 8 mg mL−1 MAI in isopropanol (IPA) is used for dipping. The excess MAI was rinsed by IPA after the dipping step. By using this method, the homogeneity of the films can be dramatically improved and their morphology can be easier controlled compared to the one-step spin-coating method.Fig. 6 exhibits the representative SEM images of the perovskite crystals formed by sequential deposition.

Q. Meng et al. modified this method by the repeated deposition of PbI2, and the high PCE of 10% for the mesoscopic PSC without HTM was attributed to a completely covered capping layer. L. Han et al. employed the strong coordinative DMSO as the solvent to retard the crystallization of PbI2, leading to a more uniform precursor film as well as the resultant perovskite film with a narrow crystal size distribution. The standard deviation of the device efficiency is only 0.57 from 120 cells, which is much lower than that using DMF, thus revealing a higher reproducibility. The concentration of MAI is another factor that affects the morphology and the electronic property of the perovskite. A higher concentration MAI solution can result in increased I ions and a decreased hole density in the perovskite films. As a result, the carrier density and charge transport ability decreased with the poor device performance. Similarly, increasing the polarity of the solvent could have a positive effect on the cell performance. G. Bochloo claimed that some MAPbI3 would dissolve in IPA during the rinsing step, and a treatment of dichloromethane can carry the IPA away rapidly and dry the film uniformly. The treatment is conducive for efficiency and reproducibility.
A prewetting step before dipping was pointed out by Grätzel et al. to be essential for a high photogenerated current. Our previous study also confirmed this conclusion. A little amount of solvent IPA would remain on the surface of the PbI2 after prewetting, so the MAI solution was slightly diluted on the solution-solid interface with a reduced nuclei density. As a result, larger crystallites were formed with a strong light scattering effect. L. Zheng et al. also found that when the reaction was carried out in a hot MAI solution (50 °C) with a higher rate of grain boundary migration, the crystal size could be enlarged without reducing the coverage of the capping layer (Fig. 5). Therefore, the enhanced absorption caused by the strong light scattering and improved transporting properties of the large crystal greatly benefited the ultimate device performance.
To extend the carrier diffusion length by partial substitution of Cl, Y. Ma et al. first reported the synthesis of MAPbI3−xClx by sequential deposition using a mixture of PbI2 and PbCl2, and the existence of Cl in the film was confirmed by EDX analysis. It was suggested that the incorporation of a second halide could ameliorate the morphology. S. G. Mhaisalkar et al. optimized the molar ratio of PbI2 and PbCl2 to be 9:1, and the corresponding device displayed better performance than that of MAPbI3. T. Bein used a mixed solution of MAI and MACl for dipping, in which the mix halide perovskite can also be synthesized.
A considerable limitation of the sequential deposition is the incomplete reaction when applied to planar devices. For a perovskite film deposited on a planar substrate, the pure crystal phase can only be obtained when the thickness is below 300 nm. When the thickness is increased, it is very hard for the MAI to penetrate and spread into the whole film, and the residual unreacted PbI2 will ultimately impair the device efficiency. A complete reaction may consume several hours, which is not only impractical but also in vain because the film will become extremely rough after such a long reaction time.

The two-step spin-coating method, also called an interdiffusion method, was proposed by J. Huang as an improved or derived method from the sequential deposition method. The greatest difference between the two methods is that the conversion from the lead halide to perovskite is accomplished by spin coating an upper layer of MAI on the precursor film followed by annealing at a high temperature (Fig. 3). The film morphology of mesoporous TiO2 by the two-step spin-coating method is also very similar to that by the sequential deposition. The quantity of MAI deposited is accurately adjusted in terms of the PbI2 down layer, so this method can not only be used to fabricate more uniform films than that by sequential deposition, but also save materials and reduce the cost. The mechanism of the two-step spin-coating can be concluded as the substitution of MAI for DMF. Due to a weak interaction, the precursor film actually contains lots of DMF molecules coordinated with PbI2, and when the MAI is deposited, PbI2 firstly reacts with I− as PbI3− then is converted to perovskite in the presence of MA+, and the DMF molecules evaporate during annealing. The solvent–solute interaction accelerates the conversion and the annealing step enables the thorough reaction. N.-G. Park studied the difference in the film morphology deposited by the two-step spin-coating method and the traditional one-step method. For the one-step method, the uncontrolled precipitation of perovskite led to a large variation in morphology with incomplete coverage on TiO2 and poor pore filling; however, the cubic-like perovskite crystals packed densely to fully cover and infiltrate TiO2. M. Grätzel and N.-G. Park et al. found that the perovskite grain size and the device performance by this method profoundly depend on the concentration of MAI (Fig. 6a). When the concentration was as low as 0.038 M, the grain size was as big as 720 nm because of the low nuclei density. The grain size then decreased with the increasing concentration and nuclei density. The mesostructured device with the largest perovskite crystallites using the lowest MAI concentration reached the highest PCE of 17.0% without hysteresis.

The two-step spin-coating method is also applicable to planar devices with thick perovskite films, which is quite different from sequential deposition. More importantly, no obvious hysteresis effect was observed in the planar device fabricated by this method with different scan directions and delay times. The hysteresis effect as the recent rising hotspot shows strong dependence on different architectures, which causes the overestimation of the PCE. It is found that a much more significant hysteresis effect was observed in the planar devices and the smaller crystals rather than the meso-structured devices and the large crystals. Previous research demonstrated that even though the hysteresis effect can be greatly improved by enlarging the crystal size, it is hard to eliminate it in a planar device. Surprisingly, the two-step spin-coating method seems to solve this problem. The high PCE of above 15% and free of hysteresis effect for a planar device might be attributed to the defect-free and negligible charge traps in the device. Moreover, a planar PSC containing a 1015 nm-thick perovskite film was successfully fabricated by J. Huang et al. combined with the solvent annealing technology (Fig. 6). Solvent (DMF) atmosphere was provided during the annealing process to accelerate the reaction between the two deposited layers, and also promote the grain boundary diffusion and reduce the grain boundary density. Consequently, much larger crystallites with high crystallinity were formed than those by conventional thermal annealing, which connected the ETL and HTL. Furthermore, most of the photogenerated carriers do not need to go through any grain boundary before being collected. The carriers diffusion length was measured as 886 nm of MAPbI3 in this device, which was responsible for the quick carrier transport and extraction. The high efficiency of 14.5% and 15.6% was obtained for devices with a 1015 nm-thick perovskite film and a 630 nm-thick perovskite film, respectively. It was also proven that a mesoporous TiO2 layer might not be necessary to eliminate the hysteresis effect.

H. J. Snaith first reported the vapor deposition method for a planar MAPbI3−xClx PSC by coevaporating PbCl2 and MAI in a vacuum. 15.4% PCE was achieved with a narrow distribution compared to that of the one-step solution process. Due to the difficulty in accurately controlling the ratio, sequential vacuum deposition was developed by depositing PbCl2 and MAI layer by layer. By heating the substrate during the vapor deposition, a homogeneous pinhole-free film with a pure crystal phase can be attained. The high degree of vacuum required in these methods is impractical and increases the cost. Y. Yang et al. used a vapor-assisted solution process, in which the solution deposited PbI2 reacted with MAI vapor on the substrate under atmospheric pressure. The resultant perovskite film was composed of microscale polycrystallites with small surface roughness, corresponding to a PCE of 12%. Other vapor generated technologies, such as chemical vapor deposition, were also used for perovskite film formation. The most striking characteristic of the morphology by such vapor deposition methods is the homogeneity, but these methods may be only applicable to planar devices.


In summary, via an effective morphology control, the power conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cells have all been boosted to above 15% by various methods. The different characteristics of each method are compared in Table 2. The sensitive dependence of PCE on the morphology was also observed. Rather than the light absorption properties, the PCEs might be more affected by the carrier transporting and collecting ability of the device. In spite of the same component or thickness, the charge transport can be quite distinct due to the different morphologies. For MAPbI3, previous results revealed a long charge carrier diffusion length of above 100 nm in thin film devices. After solvent annealing, reduced traps in the film increased the diffusion length to 886 nm. However, updated research demonstrated a much longer diffusion length of 2–8 μm in a 100 mm3 single crystal and even reached 175 μm under 1 sun illumination in single crystals with a top-seeded solution-growth method. Therefore, more investigations about the charge transport mechanism based on the different morphologies are necessary for further improving the film fabrication technique. The optimization of the other parts, for example, the components of mixed halide perovskite, should be studied and compared based on each optimized morphology, otherwise the material cannot be fully brought into play and the results might not be accurate. Moreover, there is no report yet about the relations between film stability and morphology, which might be crucial for the applications.

Method
Characteristics
One-step spin-coating
Most convenient way, needs annealing. Very sensitive to the conditions, hard to control the morphology.
Sequential deposition
Time efficient way due to very quick reaction. Uniform films with high reproducibility.
Two-step spin-coating
Quantitatively managed method, needs annealing. Uniform films with high reproducibility.
Vapor deposition
Only used for planar devices. Very homogenous.
Vapor under vacuum: energy consuming for high vacuum; vapor-assisted solution process: time consuming for annealing.
Although we temporarily cannot describe exactly what the most efficient morphology should be, many hints are given by the existing research. The hysteresis effect should be used to evaluate the quality of a perovskite film, because it has a close relation with the stored charges in the film. If the charges can transport rapidly and be extracted by the electrode effectively without delay, the hysteresis effect can be inhibited or even eliminated. We noticed that the “high-quality perovskite films” (both with a high PCE and weak hysteresis effect) possess similar morphologies, although they were obtained by different methods and treatments. Table 3 concludes the methods and corresponding PCEs by different scan directions for “high-quality perovskite films”. As to the meso-structured architecture, a pure perovskite capping layer with a large grain size is the key. The ratio of the pure perovskite layer and the nanocomposite layer should be optimized to eliminate the hysteresis effect. For the planar architecture, the perovskite films were always composed of densely packed perovskite grains. Moreover, the film thickness was above 300 nm to harvest enough light. More importantly, no grain boundaries were parallel to the substrate, which requires the crystal grain size to be bigger than the thickness of the film. Such a film can ensure that most of the photogenerated charges do not need to go through the grain boundaries before reaching the electrode. Therefore, efficient transport and collection with reduced energy loss results in a high PCE and weak hysteresis. Furthermore, the p-i-n junction of PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM exhibits more superior properties than those of the TiO2/perovskite/HTM junction. The existence of PCBM on perovskite can passivate the trap states on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite crystals by permeating into the grain boundaries. Therefore, the photocurrent hysteresis would be effectively eliminated with the significantly reduced trap density. Based on the existing methods, new technologies for industrial production is becoming urgent. Recently, the blade-coating method was extended to fabricate planar perovskite solar cells with enhanced environmental stability. A 3D printer was also exploited to fabricate a 47.3 cm2 perovskite solar cell with 11.6% efficiency via the roll-to-roll process. These methods should be a good start for perovskite solar cells to move towards practical application. For the future, however, morphology control on a large scale is still a very important issue.
