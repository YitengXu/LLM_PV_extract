The non-fullerene photoactive layer (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F) film is first immersed into a PMA solution to induce an effective surface p-type doping. An improved hole-collection and a high PCE of 11.37% was obtained, although the non-fullerene OSCs were without a commonly evaporated MoO3. This surface doping technique is an effective and feasible strategy for the printable electronics technology.

Doping can effectively increase the carrier density and conductivity and reduce ohmic losses through organic films. Moreover, it can shift the Fermi level position of the organic semiconductors, allowing efficient carrier injection and collection with minimal contact resistance in electronics. Recently, solution-based electrical doping of the organic semiconductor has been attracting extensive research interest due to the trend in making optoelectronics such as organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), via low-cost roll-to-roll printing techniques. A solution-based method of doping is generally processed by directly mixing dopants with the organic semiconductor in a single solution and co-depositing the mixture or sequentially depositing the dopants on top of the prepared organic films. The first approach can achieve a controllable electrical doping by precisely tuning the mixing ratio of dopant to semiconductor. It may not always obtain doped films with required morphology for high-performance devices, due to poor solubility of the dopants and the semiconductors as well as strong interaction between the two compounds in an identical solution. It seems that the second sequential deposition protocol by depositing the dopants on top of the prepared organic films is more suitable for large-area printing devices if the spatial diffusion and distribution of the dopant molecules can be controlled.

Phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) is a type of stable and cost-effective soluble polyoxometalate. It has previously been used as standalone hole-collecting interlayers in both conventional and inverted OSCs architectures due to high transparency in the visible spectrum and extremely high work function. In 2017, Kolesov et al. firstly reported a simple approach of sequential solution-based p-type doping by the post-process immersion of polymer donor films in PMA–nitromethane solutions. This PMA doping method rendered polymers electrically p-doped over a limited depth and enabled an efficient single-junction OSC. The device delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 7.8%, which was comparable to the reference device with an evaporated MoO3 as a hole-collecting layer. Later on, Larrain et al. reported that this doping method was highly solvent selective and the use of nitromethane was limited due to its instability in air. They further employed acetonitrile as an alternative solvent of nitromethane to enable p-type doping of the polymer donor film. The OSCs devices prepared from photoactive layer film immersed by the PMA–acetonitrile solutions delivered a superior PCE and an increased stability when exposed to normal atmospheric conditions. These findings indicate that the post-process immersion technique is a feasible protocol to conduct electrical p-type doping of the organic semiconductors for printable electronics.
It is well known that the PCE of the OSCs keeps increasing owing to the state-of-the-art materials chemistry and rational device engineering. Especially, a notable PCE over 17% for both single-junction and tandem OSCs has been reported after the recent emergence of non-fullerene (NF) acceptors. Most efficient records, however, are achieved at a small area through a spin coating method in an inert gas-filled glove-box, which is not adaptable for future practical productions. Herein, we introduce the aforementioned p-type doping by an immersion method to the NF OSCs system. The NF photoactive layer PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F is immersed into a PMA isopropanol solution. The polymer donor PTB7-Th in the blends could be oxidized after the penetration depth of PMA molecules during the processing. The induced surface oxidative (p-type) doping of the films therefore improves hole-collection and limits carrier recombination. Consequently, the NF OSCs device still delivers a high PCE of 11.37% without a commonly evaporated MoO3 as a hole-collecting layer. Furthermore, we achieve a highly efficient printable NF OSCs via transfer-printing or doctor-blading the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PH1000) electrode in an ambient condition on top of the immersed NF photoactive layer. These results indicate the realization of the organic film surface doping via the solution immersion technique possesses a great potential for a truly low-cost, large-area electronics technology in the near future.
PMA is known as oxide cluster. It comprises twelve molybdenum oxyanions around a phosphorus anion forming a closed three-dimensional framework. PTB7-Th is a common polymer donor and has ever been used in many high efficient fullerene or non-fullerene acceptors based OSCs system. The chemical structure of PMA and PTB7-Th is shown in Fig. 1a. We first evaluate the changes in electrical conductivity of the PTB7-Th films with a post immersion in PMA isopropanol solution (hereafter referred to as “PMA-im-PTB7-Th”). The orthogonal and polar solvent isopropanol with a low surface tension can ensure that the polymer film will not be damaged during the immersion process. PTB7-Th films were then deposited on the ITO substrate with a pre-etched groove. Then, the films were immersed into 0.1 M PMA isopropanol solution for different times and subsequently rinsed with pure isopropanol solution to remove excess PMA molecules. It is obvious that the conductivity increases from 3.30 × 10−6 S cm−1 for pristine PTB7-Th film to 2.77 × 10−3 S cm−1 for the PMA-im-PTB7-Th film with a 30 min post immersion (Fig. 1b). Moreover, we observe the conductivity monotonously increases with the immersion time from 0.5 min to 30 min, indicating an increase in the penetration depth of PMA into the polymer film. To investigate the reason for the improvements of the film conductivity, we study the optical properties of pristine PTB7-Th and PMA-im-PTB7-Th films (Fig. 1c). The normalized change of transmittance ΔT/T < 0 reveals the polaron bands of PTB7-Th polymer in the region, while ΔT/T > 0 represents the bleaching of the main π–π* absorption bands. Correspondingly, a new absorption band appears in the near infrared region for the PMA-im-PTB7-Th film (Fig. S1, ESI), which is assigned to the formation of radical anion. These polaron bands suggest the electrical p-type doping into the depth of the organic film. From ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) in Fig. 1d, the Fermi level of pristine PTB7-Th film is positioned at −4.45 eV, and then shifted to −4.75 eV for the film after PMA immersion. The down shift of the Fermi level position confirms the existence of a p-type doping effect.
To further investigate the p-type doping process, we conduct a comparative analysis of the Mo (3d) and S (2p) core level near the surface of pristine PTB7-Th and PMA-im-PTB7-Th films through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey XPS spectra of 30 nm-thick pristine PTB7-Th and PMA-im-PTB7-Th (30 min) films as well as pure PMA powder are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI). From the high resolution XPS spectra in Fig. 2a, the pure PMA powder reveals four peaks corresponding to the signatures of Mo (3d3/2) and (3d5/2), respectively. The dominant peaks at 232.69 eV and 233.50 eV are typical value of the Mo6+ oxidation states, while the minor peaks at 232.69 eV and 233.50 eV can be assigned to Mo5+ oxidation states. However, the XPS spectra of the PMA-im-PTB7-Th film only reveal two main peaks corresponding to the signatures of Mo (3d3/2) and (3d5/2) in the Mo5+ oxidation states. The reduction of the valence state of molybdenum indicates charges transfer from PTB7-Th to PMA in the PMA-im-PTB7-Th film and the PTB7-Th is thus oxidized. In the S (2p) region (Fig. 2b), the pristine PTB7-Th reveals a neutral characteristic, exhibiting a signature doublet of S (2p1/2) at 165.31 eV and (2p3/2) at 164.07 eV, respectively. With regard to the PMA-im-PTB7-Th film, the S (2p) spectra broaden and a weak doublet at higher binding energies corresponding to oxidized sulfur appears. Hence, the reduction of molybdenum in PMA molecules accompanied by the oxidation of sulfur in the PMA-im-PTB7-Th film provides clear evidence of the p-type doping process. An improved hole-collection and a limited carrier recombination are anticipated in the subsequent NF OSCs devices through this surface p-type doping technique.
Consequently, we further investigate the photovoltaic performance of the NF OSCs with an inverted structure: ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/Ag, where the photoactive layer PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F is immersed into the prepared PMA isopropanol solution for different times (hereafter referred to as “PMA-im-PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F”). Schematic structure and the energy alignment of the NF OSCs are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The bottom ITO/ZnO and the top Ag electrode are used to collect the electron and hole, respectively. Relevant parameters of energy levels in the device configuration are obtained from the literature. From the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves in Fig. 3c, the reference NF OSCs where the photoactive layer is not immersed into the PMA solution and Ag is deposited directly on the photoactive layer as top-electrode deliver an extremely poor performance with a PCE of 0.97%, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.16 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.36 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 31%. The poor performance is attributed to an inferior rectification in the devices due to the lack of hole-collecting interlayers between the photoactive layer and Ag electrode. After treating the photoactive layer with a PMA immersion, the devices deliver an obviously improved photovoltaic performance. When the immersion time is up to 3 min, the device reaches a highest PCE of 11.37%, with a VOC of 0.69 V, JSC of 26.01 mA cm−2 and FF of 64%. The synergistically enhanced photovoltaic performance parameters confirm the improved hole-collection and limited carrier recombination in vertical, indicating the formation of a separate hole-collection interlayers. The dark J–V characteristics (Fig. S3, ESI) of the devices confirm the efficient carrier extraction properties from the active layer to the electrode. Due to the PMA with a strong oxidation ability, it can achieve p-type doping to different polymer donors. We further extend this approach to other NF photoactive layer system such as PM6:IT-4F. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI), the device with the photoactive layer immersed in PMA solution is significantly superior over the reference without the immersion process. To rule out the influence caused by the films morphology, we perform the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement. It can be seen the PMA-im-PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F film shows a surface morphology similar to that of the pristine PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend film with a slightly decreased roughness (Fig. S5a and b, ESI). However, longer immersion time for the photoactive layer is undesirable as the devices immersed for 5 min and 10 min show a progressive descent of the photovoltaic performance, especially JSC and FF. This effect can be correlated with the effective p-type doping over a limited depth, which would thin the thickness of the photoactive layer. Detailed photovoltaic performance parameters of the devices with different immersion times are summarized in Table 1.

For the organic photovoltaics community, a major challenge is translating the methodologies from laboratory-scale devices to industrial-scale fabrication. Further expanding the application of this doping technique for future practical industrial manufacturing, we demonstrate highly efficient printable NF OSCs via transfer-printing or doctor-blading the conducting polymer PH1000 electrode in an ambient condition on top of the PMA immersed NF photoactive layer. The schematic processes of the film-transfer lamination method are shown in Fig. 4a. Detailed descriptions are provided in the ESI. It can be seen that the reference printable NF OSCs reveal a poor PCE of 7.64%, with a VOC of 0.67 V, JSC of 21.05 mA cm−2 and FF of 53% (Fig. S6, ESI). When the NF photoactive layer PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F is treated with PMA post immersion, the cells achieve a notable PCE of 10.37% (Fig. 4b). The negligible changes of the contact angle to deionized water of the samples exclude the enhanced device performance caused by the difference in surface wettability (Fig. S5c and d, ESI). The enhanced JSC and FF values can be attributed to a stimulative hole-collection and reduced carrier recombination caused by the induced surface p-type doping. All the printable cells are tested with an aperture and an Ag-based total reflective mirror to avoid the illumination loss accounting for the low reflectance of PH1000 electrode. While we also note that the JSC of the printable cells is lower than that of the cells with evaporated Ag as the top electrode (Fig. 3b), which can be attributed to the absorption spectra overlap between PH1000 and the NF photoactive layer in the near infrared region (>700 nm). The current density integrated from the EQE spectra (Fig. 4c) agrees well with JSC values extracted from J–V curves. Furthermore, we also try to remodel a 3D printer for efficient slot-die processed NF OSCs via printing the PH1000 directly on top of the PMA-im-PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F surface. The schematic illustration and image of the coating setup are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI). From the inset physical display in Fig. S8 (ESI), the PH1000 can be printed on PMA-PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F surface to form a homogeneous film. An optimal performance of PCE = 9.72% for the printable NF OSCs through this doctor-blading process is achieved, which is comparable to that from the film-transfer lamination method.
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple approach to induce an effective surface p-type doping of polymer donor and their blends with acceptors by post immersing the films into a polyoxometalate (PMA) isopropanol solution. The immersion process allows the PMA molecules penetrate into and oxidize the polymer donor. The PMA-doped PTB7-Th film possesses an increased electrical conductivity and work function. This technique is first employed in the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F based NF OSCs system. The induced surface p-type doping of the photoactive layer films improves hole collection and limits carrier recombination. A high PCE of 11.37% is therefore obtained in the corresponding NF OSCs without a commonly evaporated MoO3 as a hole-collecting layer. With future research extending the application of this doping technique, we fabricate highly efficient printable NF OSCs via transfer-printing the conducting polymer PH1000 electrode directly on top of the PMA-im-PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F film in an ambient condition. A notable PCE of 10.37% is achieved, which is obviously superior to the reference devices. Moreover, we obtained an optimal performance of PCE = 9.72% for the printable NF OSCs by printing the PH1000 directly on top of the PMA-im-PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F surface by a motor-driven, computer controlled slot-die coating system. We believe that the ease and efficient p-type doping of the organic film realized via the solution immersion technique possesses a great potential for a truly low-cost, large-area printable electronics technology in the near future.
