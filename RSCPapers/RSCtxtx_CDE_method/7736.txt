Copper sulfide (CuS) is one of the most important counter electrodes (CEs) in high-efficiency, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In this work, we investigated the effect of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba ion incorporation into the CuS layer on the photovoltaic performance of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. Metal ion-doped CuS was deposited by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method on the FTO substrate. As a result, the quantum dot photoanode with the optimized Ca-doped CuS CE exhibited power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.33%, which is much higher than bare CuS CE (PCE 1.68%), Ba-doped CuS (1.81%), Mg-doped CuS (1.82%) and Sr-doped CuS (1.67%). A sandwiched structural Ca-doped CuS/graphen sheet (Ca-doped CuS/GS) electrode was prepared by repeating electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of graphene sheets and deposition of Ca-doped CuS nanoparticles. When a Ca-doped CuS/graphene sheet (Ca-doped CuS/GS) was used as a CE, the QDSSC exhibited higher power conversion efficiency (2.73%) compared to cells with Ca-doped CuS (2.33%) and bare-CuS (1.68%) cathodes. A full description of reasons for efficiency enhancement are discussed in this paper by using diverse electrochemical and spectral analyses.

Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), a type of third-generation solar cell, are currently under extensive investigation. QDSSC properties include hot electron injection, high molar extinction coefficients, large intrinsic dipole moments, low cost and simple synthesis methods, and tunable band gaps. The basic structure and performance of the QDSSCs are almost similar to dye-sensitized solar cells, with the difference that quantum dots (QDs) are used as sensitizers instead of dye molecules. Nevertheless, the efficiency of QDSSCs is lower than that of DSSCs; the main reason for the poor efficiency of QDSSCs is a high charge transfer resistance on the counter electrode (CE) surface, and a fast charge recombination at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface. In these results, besides photoanodes, CE plays an important role by catalytic reduction of redox electrolytes in transferring electrons from the external circuit back to redox electrolytes.

The best recorded efficiency of QDSSCs, 7.04%, was obtained in recent research, and in the past few years much effort has been devoted to improving photovoltaic performance and the optimization and design of QDSSCs. As mentioned, the CE is an important part of a solar cell and is responsible for catalysing reduction of the oxidized redox in the electrolyte system by electrons from external circuits and keeping the cell working. Recently, researchers have suggested various Pt-free inorganic chalcogenide materials (e.g., Cu2S, CuS, CoS, PbS) and hybrid graphene-based nanocomposites, as compatible CEs in the sulfide/polysulfide-based electrolytes for QDSSCs, since they have a large-area deposition capability. Among these materials, CuS has attracted extensive attention because of its attractive physical and chemical properties for potential applications in many fields. As an important p-type semiconductor (direct band gap 1.2–2.0 eV), CuS with various phase structures and valence states shows many unusual electronic, optical, and other physical and chemical properties. The CuS thin films result in some unique properties and promising applications in numerous fields, such as the cathode material in solar cells, optical filters, nanoswitches, thermoelectric and photoelectric transformers, superconductors, gas sensors and lithium-ion batteries.
Since the specific surface area of the catalyst is an important factor in the CE, we developed a facile synthesis of CuS and CuS/graphene sheet (CuS/GS) nanocomposite on fluorine-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO). The doping of a CuS CE with metals ions such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+ improves the electrocatalytic activity greatly compared to CuS in a QDSSC by promoting electron production; hence the metal ions-doped CuS becomes much more effective in catalysing the reduction of Sn2− to S2− than bare CuS CEs and thereby improves QDSSC performance. In this work, Mg2+-, Ca2+-, Sr2+- and Ba2+-doped CuS were in situ grown on FTO glass substrate by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for QDSSCs. SILAR is a facile, low-cost and fast technique that has been successfully used to synthesize CuS and metal ion-doped CuS on the CE in the QDSSCs. As a result, the Ca-doped CuS CE shows better catalytic activity for polysulfide reduction than the bare-CuS and other the metal ion-doped CuS CE. Thus, the obtained Ca-doped CuS CE delivers 2.33% efficiency, which is comparable to that of the bare CuS electrode (1.63%) tested under similar conditions. The Ca-doped CuS/GS CE was prepared by repeating electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of graphene sheets and deposition of Ca-doped CuS nanoparticles on FTO. The 2-D structure of graphene sheets provides a high surface area for the deposit of Ca-doped CuS nanoparticles; thus the GS plays the role of supporting material and supplying a large number of active sites for nucleation. A layer-by-layer method has been applied to assemble the Ca-CuS/GS to control the size of CuS nanoparticles to achieve a high surface area. The highest energy conversion efficiency (η) of 2.73% is obtained by Ca-CuS/GS CE, corresponding to the efficiency increment (70%), when compared to the bare CuS CE.

All chemicals were purchased from Merck Company and used without further purification. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (transmission >90% in visible range, sheet resistance 8 Ω per square, 2.3 mm thickness) and Surlyn spacer (50 μm) were purchased from Dyesol (Australia). The morphology of the films was observed via a Philips XL-30FESEM emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to confirm calcium loading. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells were measured using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). Obtained spectra from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were fitted by Z-view software (v2.9c, Scribner Associates Inc). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were performed in a three-electrode system with SCE used as the reference in 0.1 M Na2S/0.1 M S electrolyte.


The CuS CE was prepared via the SILAR method. For deposition of CuS, at first the FTO substrates were cleaned in water and ethanol using an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The FTO glass substrates were then immersed into 0.5 M aqueous Cu(NO3)2 for 60 s, rinsed with ethanol and dehydrated with a dryer, and then immersed again in a 0.5 M Na2S methanol solution for 60 s. The anodes were rinsed with methanol and dried with a dryer. The two-step immersion procedure comprised a single SILAR cycle. This process was repeated up to 3 times. The prepared CE was dried at 60 °C for 30 min.


To incorporate Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions into the CuS electrode, appropriate molar percentages of 10% and 20% (0.05 and 0.1 M) of Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Ca(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Sr(NO3)2 and BaCl2·2H2O were blended with 0.5 M Cu(NO3)2·3H2O. The experimental molar ratios of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O to the above mentioned salts are 10:1 and 5:1, respectively. The cleaned FTO glass substrates were immersed horizontally into solutions of the doped metal ions of Cu (1:5, 1:10) for 60 s, rinsed with ethanol and dehydrated with a dryer. They were immersed in a 0.5 M Na2S methanol solution for 60 s, rinsed with methanol and dehydrated with a dryer. These processes were repeated up to 3 times. The prepared CEs were dried at 60 °C for 30 min.


The Ca-CuS/GS CE was prepared by repeating EPD of graphene sheets and deposition of Ca-CuS nanoparticles on the FTO via the SILAR method. To maintain good contact between graphene and FTO-coated glass, the electrophoretic deposition approach was applied. Graphene nanosheet aqueous solution was prepared via a modified Hummers' method. Electrophoretic deposition was performed using constant current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 in 0.2 mg mL−1 graphene aqueous solution. The GS electrode was prepared by EPD of graphene for 10 min. After deposition for 3 min, the graphene-deposited FTO was withdrawn from the solution slowly and dried at room temperature. As mentioned, the Ca-CuS/GS electrode was prepared by repeating EPD and SILAR. An EPD process followed by a SILAR process was indicated as 1 cycle of Ca-CuS/GS deposition. The Ca-CuS electrode was prepared by repeating the SILAR process 4 times. Briefly, the electrode was immersed in the Ca-doped CuS (1:10) solution and rinsed with ethanol, and then immersed in 0.5 M Na2S methanol solution.


The TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated on ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO substrate via the doctor blade method. Two thin layers of TiO2 particles (P25, Degussa, Germany) were coated on FTO glass as previously reported. To prepare the scattering layer in the photoanode, the TiO2 nanosphere was synthesized according to the literature. Typically, FTO glass substrates were first dipped in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and dried in air. The double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode was coated onto the FTO plates by the doctor blade method and dried at 120 °C for 5 min. The coated bilayer films were gradually heated to 500 °C and calcined for 15 min. The scattering layer was deposited by using the doctor blade and then dried at 120 °C for 5 min and sintered at 500 °C for 15 min. For surface modification, the electrodes were immersed in the TiCl4 aqueous as described previously. The photoanode films with a thickness of about 16 μm were obtained by coating the hierarchical TiO2 sphere paste on FTO glasses using the doctor blade method. The as-prepared TiO2 electrodes were used for further sensitization with CdS, CdSe and ZnS QDs. The CdS-coated TiO2 films were heated at 300 °C for 30 min.


To fabricate CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs, deposition of CdS, CdSe and ZnS QDs onto the TiO2 photoanodes was realized via the SILAR method. First, the TiO2 film was dipped in 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 1 min, rinsed in methanol and dried with a dryer, dipped for 1 min in 0.1 M Na2S methanol (methanol/water (1:1)) solution. Finally, they were rinsed in deionized water and dried. The two-step dipping procedure corresponded to a single SILAR cycle. The process was repeated 5 times. The CdS-coated TiO2 films were heated at 300 °C for 30 min. For the subsequent SILAR process of CdSe QDs, the TiO2/CdS electrodes were dipped in the ethanol solution of 0.5 M, Cd(NO3)2 for 5 min at 55 °C and then immersed in aqueous solution of Na2SeSO3 for 30 min at 55 °C and rinsed with deionized water. The two-step dipping procedure, which corresponds to a single SILAR cycle, was heated at 150 °C for 30 min. The process was repeated 5 times. An aqueous Na2SeSO3 solution was prepared by mixing 0.3 M selenium powder and 0.6 M Na2SO3 at 70 °C for 7 h. The SILAR method was also used to deposit the ZnS passivation layer. All samples were deposited with a ZnS layer for improving cell stability and performance. The TiO2/CdS/CdSe samples were coated with ZnS by alternately dipping the samples in 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solutions. Finally, the CdS/CdSe/ZnS-coated TiO2 films were heated at 300 °C for 3 min.


CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoelectrodes are assembled with a CuS, Ca-CuS and Ca-CuS/GS as the CE using a 50 μm Surlyn spacer. The polysulfide electrolyte consisting of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S is injected into the cells via capillary effect and the cell was then fabricated.


The XRD patterns were used to characterize the crystal structure of the obtained product. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of CuS, Ca-CuS and Ca-CuS/GS thin films on FTO substrate via the SILAR method, respectively. As seen in Fig. 1, there are five peaks corresponding to (0 0 6), (1 1 2), (1 1 5), (1 1 6) and (1 1 8) crystal planes, which the diffracted peaks of the CuS cubic phase in the XRD match with reported values (JCPDS file no. 78-2122). Strong diffraction of FTO is mainly due to the low thickness of the as-synthesized samples without any heat treatment. The extension in 2θ of 20–30 range in the XRD pattern in Fig. 1(c) confirms the presence of graphene in the Ca-CuS/GS sample.

Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of CuS, Ca-CuS and Ca-CuS/GS thin film samples. Adhesion of the electrocatalytic active materials on the FTO is an essential factor in the efficiency of QDSSCs. The reason is that they may be released into the electrolyte solution with resulting reduction in the power conversion efficiency. When the Ca is added to the bare CuS, surface morphology changes and the number of particles on the substrate increases.
The morphology of Ca-doped CuS is drastically different from the undoped due to the presence of various ion species in the solutions. As mentioned previously, for preparing Ca-doped CuS, calcium acetate is added to the 0.5 M aqueous Cu(NO3)2. In this case, the ionic solution is different from that of used in un-doped cathode. Besides, the doping of Ca affected the morphology of the CuS particle because of differences in ionic radii between dopants and Cu cation. The Ca-dopant ion accessed into the CuS lattice and resulted in distorting CuS lattice as well as affecting the morphology of CuS NPs. Fig. 2(c) illustrates a surface morphology of Ca-CuS/GS CE with high porosity, which is more suitable for electrolyte injection and indicates an increase in Jsc, and will boost CE performance. It should be mentioned that because the nanostructures have been firmly attached to the substrate, they are not soluble in the electrolyte and it is expected that this CE will demonstrate good performance. The cross-sectional SEM image of the CuS CE has been shown in Fig. 2(d). In this image, FTO and CuS layers are clearly observed. From the cross-sectional image, the thickness of the CuS film is verified to be ∼1 μm.
EDS analysis (Fig. 3(a–c)) was applied to determine the elemental composition of the as-prepared samples. The data show Cu and S in the bare CuS, 10% Ca-CuS and 10% Ca-CuS/GS CEs. As shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), it can be clearly seen that the as-prepared samples also contain Ca. Fig. 3(c) shows 10% Ca-CuS/GS, which confirms the presence of carbon in addition to the other elements.
Fig. 4 shows J–V curves of the CdS–CdSe–ZnS QDSSCs using CuS, 10% Mg-doped CuS, 10% Ca-doped CuS, 10% Sr-doped CuS and 10% Ba-doped CuS under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding detailed photovoltaic performances are listed in Table 1. The photovoltaic performance of the Ca-CuS is much better than that of the device based on the bare CuS CE and the other metal ion-doped CEs. Therefore, the J–V curves of QDSSCs with different concentrations of Ca2+ ions in CuS CE and optimized concentrations Ca-CuS/GS ​(20% Ca-CuS, 10% Ca-CuS and 10% Ca-CuS/GS) are shown in Fig. 5. Corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Note that the CdS–CdSe–ZnS QDSSCs employing different CEs exhibit very different values of short-circuit current density (Jsc), while showing similar values of open-circuit voltage (Voc). QDSSC efficiencies with Ca-CuS and Ca-CuS/GS CEs are higher than the device based on the bare CuS CE. The CuS CE based on the QDSSCs has a Jsc of 9.94 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.32 and yielded superior power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.63%. In order to improve catalytic activity, we tried to dope the Ca2+ ion into the CuS and applied it as an efficient Ca-doped CuS catalyst in the QDSSC.

The 20% Ca-CuS CE exhibits η of 2.18%, a noticeable improvement in efficiency compared to the undoped CuS. The 10% Ca-CuS CE provided the optimal η of 2.33% with improvement in the Jsc (13.2 mA cm−2) and the FF of 0.33. The appropriate doping amount of Ca ion in CuS (10%) can effectively catalyse the polysulfide electrolyte in QDSSCs. In contrast, 5% Ca-CuS CE does not increase the catalytic activity; thus it was not reported as relevant information in this work. Although these electrodes show high catalytic activity, to further improve catalytic activity, a sandwich structural Ca-doped CuS/graphene sheet (Ca-doped CuS/GS) electrode was prepared. The 10% Ca-CuS/GS CE exhibited η of 2.73%, Jsc of 16.26 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.33. Noticeable improvements appeared in the PCE and Jsc. The GS plays a key role as a supporting material as it supplies a large number of active sites for nucleation. Fig. 6 presents the J–V curves of the CdS–CdSe–ZnS QDSSCs based on CuS, 20% Mg-doped CuS, 20% Ca-doped CuS, 20% Sr-doped CuS and 20% Ba-doped CuS CEs under one sun illumination. The obtained photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves have been collected in Table 3. The photovoltaic performance of the 10% and 20% Ca-doped CuS CEs were much better than that of the device based on the bare CuS CE and the other metal ion-doped CEs.

Fig. 7 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of CuS, 20% Ca-CuS, 10% Ca-CuS and 10% Ca-CuS/GS CEs using FTO glass substrate as a baseline over the range of 300–1000 nm. In the Ca-doped CuS/GS cathode, two different layers consisting of Ca-doped CuS and graphene sheets were applied to boost catalytic behavior. Thus, this cathode shows the highest absorption intensity because of its greater thickness compared to other cathodes. CuS thin film has the lowest absorption intensity due to the lower layer in this cathode.
To investigate the catalytic activities at the electrode–electrolyte interface, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a three-electrode system consisting of a working electrode, Pt wire CE, and an SCE (saturated calomel electrode) reference electrode with the polysulfide electrolyte at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. Fig. 8 shows the CVs of CuS, 20% Ca-CuS, 10% Ca-CuS and 10% Ca-CuS/GS. The negative and positive peaks of the CV correspond to the reduction of Sn2− and the oxidation of nS2−, respectively. The high current of the peak in the CV indicates an active highly catalytic reaction of the electrode for the S2−/Sn2− redox couples in the polysulfide electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 5, 10% Ca-CuS and 10% Ca-CuS/GS CE have higher redox current densities than bare CuS CE, indicating that the Ca-doped CuS electrodes are effective for catalysing reduction of the polysulfide redox couple. The 10% Ca-CuS/GS CE shows a higher current peak than electrodes 1–3, which indicates that this electrode has greater catalytic activity.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most important tools to elucidate the charge transfer and transport processes in various electrochemical systems. To further investigate the interfacial electron transfer process in the QDSSCs, we studied EIS analysis on symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes for the as-prepared CuS, Ca-doped CuS and Ca-doped CuS/GS CEs, which is closely related to the catalytic activity. Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist plots for the symmetrical cells. High frequency in the Nyquist plot of cells shows information about the series resistance (Rs) denoted by the non-zero intercept of the real axis. The middle-frequency semicircle is attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and capacitance (Cμ). The Warburg diffusion process of S2−/Sx2− in the electrolyte appeared in the lower-frequency region. These values were obtained by fitting with an equivalent circuit using Z-View software. We employed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to compare the Rct between the polysulfide electrolyte and the CE. Rct values of 20% Ca-CuS, 10% Ca-CuS, 10% Ca-CuS/GS and bare CuS are 22.89, 13.46, 6.07 and 24.22 Ω cm2, respectively, indicating that both compounds possess good catalytic activity. The Rct value for Ca-CuS/GS was much smaller than that of the bare CuS indicating that Ca-CuS/GS has excellent charge transfer at the interface of the electrolyte and CE. The recombination of electrons in TiO2 with acceptors in the electrolyte is normally referred to as electron lifetime. Electron lifetime (τn) calculated via the following equation eqn (1):
(1)
The τ values for the best as-prepared CE sample, 10% Ca-CuS/GS (0.57 s), is larger compared to the standard CE, CuS bare (0.43 s). These results indicate that the electron recombination is effectively suppressed in Ca-CuS/GS CE.

We demonstrated that the prepared Ca-CuS on FTO substrate via a SILAR method was much more effective than bare CuS in catalysing the reduction of Sn2− to S2−. The Ca-doped CuS/GS was prepared on FTO substrate by repeating EPD of graphene sheets and deposition of CuS nanoparticles on FTO. Our results indicate that this CE has high electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfide electrolyte and improved photovoltaic characteristics of QDSSC compared to bare CuS and Ca-CuS CE. A QDSSC based on a 10% Ca-doped CuS/GS electrode gained an improved short-circuit current density of 16.26 mA cm−2 and overall conversion efficiency of 2.73%. Finally, 36% higher power conversion efficiency was achieved by applying a 20% Ca-CuS CE than the bare CuS CE, a 45% higher power conversion efficiency was achieved by 10% Ca-CuS CE and a 70% higher power conversion efficiency was attained by using 10% Ca-CuS/GS as CE, and a 63% rise in current density for Ca-CuS/GS were observed compared to the CuS electrode. This exhibits that the Ca-CuS/GS nanocomposite significantly enhanced the electrochemical property, which undoubtedly accounts for the improved photovoltaic performance. This layered nanocomposite provides a promising direction for developing nanostructures for high electrocatalytic CEs. Therefore, all of these compounds, and especially Ca-CuS/GS, show great potential as efficient and low-cost CEs for QDSSCs.
