We demonstrate solution-processed Ga-doped ZnO incorporated as an interfacial electron transport layer into inverted organic solar cells with active layers comprising either PCDTBT or PTB7 mixed with PC71BM. The 5.03 at% Ga-doped ZnO showed the best efficiencies of 5.56% and 7.34% for PCDTBT and PTB7 polymers respectively.

Organic solar cells have attracted particular attention due to their low cost, light weight, flexibility, and low temperature fabrication. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) composites show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) in excess of 6%. Recently, a PCE of 7–9% has been reported using a thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7)/PCBM BHJ. The BHJ solar cells are composed of an active layer sandwiched between an indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) positive electrode and a Ca low-work function negative electrode. The PEDOT:PSS layer and the low-work-function metal electrode are known to degrade the device lifetime. In particular, the low-work function metal is susceptible to degradation by oxygen and water vapor. Long-term stability is a problem because PEDOT:PSS is hygroscopic and acidic. In addition, optical loss due to absorption of the PEDOT:PSS film is significant, approaching 10% in the visible range and even higher in the near infrared region. In order to overcome these problems of conventional organic devices, inverted structures of solar cells have been developed in recent years because of their potential for superior device stability and manufacturing compatibility. In the inverted structure, a high work function metal is used as a hole collecting electrode, while the n-type metal oxides such as SnO2, TiO2 and ZnO are used as buffer layers. These buffer layers also help to redistribute the light intensity inside the devices and to protect the active layer from degradation by oxygen or moisture. Among the metal oxides used in inverted solar cells, ZnO is an excellent cathode interfacial layer due to its high electron mobility, good transparency, low cost, non-toxicity, air-stability, and hole blocking properties.

Recently, in order to increase the device performance of inverted solar cells, several groups have studied the use of metal doped n-type buffer layers. Metal doping is an effective procedure to modify the grain size, orientation, and conductivity and could greatly influence the optical and electrical properties of n-type buffer layers. The group-III atoms such as Al, Ga, and In have been investigated as n-type dopants for ZnO because they can replace the Zn sites in the ZnO crystal and more than that one free electron is generated. Among group III elements, gallium has an ionic radius of 0.62 Å and a covalent radius of 1.26 Å, which are the closest to those of Zn (0.74 and 1.31 Å). The covalent bond length of Ga–O (1.92 Å) is close to that of Zn–O (1.97 Å), which results in less lattice deformation in ZnO when Ga substitutes for Zn. In addition, Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films have some merits due to their low material cost, high transparency, high stability and small lattice mismatch upon doping compared with those of other doped ZnO films. To enhance the electron transport properties in the ZnO films, Ga was used in this work as a doping impurity. The efficiency of solar cells has been improved using GZO interfacial layers. In this paper, inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs) with solution-processed ZnO and GZO based electron transport layers (ETLs) have been systematically studied using low band gap polymers based on PCDTBT:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and PTB7:PC71BM. Especially, we have achieved efficiencies of 5.31% and 7.34% for IOSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM by using ZnO and 5.03 at% GZO films as the ETLs, respectively.

The inverted cell device structure, molecular structures of PCDTBT, PTB7, and PC71BM, and the energy levels of the component materials are shown in Fig. 1. The energy levels of PCDTBT, PTB7, PC71BM, and MoO3 were taken from the literature. The ZnO and GZO layers were introduced as interfacial layers because of their large band gap and these ETLs have a similar work function, reported to be around −4.23 to −4.30 eV. When light irradiates the photoactive layer of the solar cells through the ITO electrode, the active layer will absorb photons to produce excitons and the excitons will diffuse towards and dissociate at the PCDTBT:PC71BM interface into electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor PC71BM and holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor PCDTBT. Since the LUMO level of ZnO (−4.2 eV) is the same as that of PC71BM, electrons can easily transport to the ITO electrode through ZnO. As the HOMO level (−7.4 eV) of ZnO is much lower than that (−5.5 eV) of PCDTBT, so that it blocks the hole transport from PCDTBT to the ITO electrode. The HOMO level (−5.3 eV) of MoO3 is very close to the HOMO level (−5.12 eV) of PCDTBT, and this facilitates the hole transfer to the Al electrode through MoO3. While the relatively high-lying LUMO (−2.3 eV) of MoO3 prevents the electron transfer from PC71BM to the Al electrode.


Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of PCDTBT, PTB7, PC71BM, composite of PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM films. PCDTBT shows absorption from 400 to 700 nm and PC71BM shows absorption from 400 nm to 800 nm. The absorption spectrum of the PCDTBT:PC71BM composite is the superposition of PCDTBT and PC71BM which implies that both PCDTBT and PC71BM will contribute photocurrent for polymer solar cells fabricated using PCDTBT:PC71BM. PTB7 shows strong absorption from 540 to 750 nm. However the absorption from 300 to 500 nm is relatively weak. To compensate the absorption of PTB7, PC71BM, which has strong absorption in the visible range, is used as the acceptor. The resulting PTB7:PC71BM blend film exhibits a strong absorption covering a range from 300 to about 800 nm. The absorption spectra of ZnO and GZO with different doping concentrations are shown in Fig. S1. Absorption spectra of GZO show that the absorption edge is slightly shifted towards the shorter wavelength (blue shift) when compared to ZnO. This is mainly attributed to the Burstein–Moss effect, since the absorption edge of a degenerate semiconductor is shifted to shorter wavelengths with increasing carrier concentration.
It is well known that the electrical properties of the interfacial layers are very important for the performance of the devices because they will affect charge transport at the interface. Fig. 2b shows the variation of resistivity of ZnO films with Ga doping concentration. The resistivity is found to be 7.63, 5.53, 3.76, 3.27, 3.87 and 4.06 × 10−3 Ω cm for ZnO, 1.50, 3.60, 5.03, 7.12 and 9.08 at% GZO. The resistivity values of GZO films are small when compared to that of ZnO. It is observed that the resistivity decreases continuously as the Ga concentration is increased up to 5.03 at%, beyond which the resistivity was found to increase again. At lower doping concentrations the electrons from the dopant play a dominant role in the film and as less oxygen vacancy scattering occurs, the resistivity decreases. At a higher Ga-doping concentration of above 5.03 at%, the disorder produced in the lattice (due to difference in the ionic radius of Zn2+ and Ga3+) increases the efficiency of scattering mechanisms such as phonon scattering and ionized impurity scattering which, in turn, causes an increase in resistivity. However, at higher doping concentration, the resistivity increases because an increase in the number of dopant atoms leads to some kind of neutral defects and these neutralized Ga atoms do not contribute free electrons.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PCDTBT:PC71BM based IOSCs fabricated using ETLs of ZnO and GZO are shown in Fig. 2c and this has been measured under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. The solar cell parameters in terms of the short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rshunt) are summarized in Table 1. The PCDTBT:PC71BM based device with ZnO exhibits a Jsc of 8.85 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.86 V, FF of 50.27% and PCE of 3.72%. The PCDTBT:PC71BM based IOSC with 5.03 at% GZO exhibited the best photovoltaic performance among all the devices with a PCE of 5.56%, Jsc of 10.46 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.90 V and FF of 59.03%. The overall device performance of GZO was found to be better when compared to the ZnO based device. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PCDTBT:PC71BM based IOSCs are shown in Fig. 2d. The GZO interfacial ETLs exhibited a substantially enhanced response from 350 to 650 nm as compared with that of ZnO. The maximum IPCE value of the 5.03 at% GZO based device is 68% in comparison with 55% for the ZnO device. The IPCE spectra are consistent with the measured Jsc in the devices.

The J–V characteristics of the PTB7:PC71BM based IOSCs are shown in Fig. 2e. The 5.03 at% GZO based IOSC shows photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 14.96 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.75 V, FF of 64.95% and PCE of 7.34%. As shown in Fig. S2d and Table 1, increasing the Ga-concentration from 1.50 to 5.03 at% Ga leads to improvement of the solar cell performance. The Rs decreases from 10.81 to 6.94 Ω cm2 and Rshunt increases from 665.51 to 1809.52 Ω cm2. The decrease in Rs indicates the electron collection and transportation benefits from the high-quality contact between the PTB7:PC71BM active layer and GZO layer. The decreased Rs and increased Rshunt contribute to the device performance by improving the FF. From Table 1, it is observed that a further increase of the doping concentration to 7.12 and 9.08 at% Ga leads to increased Rs. The increased Rs (10.45 to 12.75 Ω cm2) leads to the decrease of FF from 60.40 to 58.36% respectively. It is evident that this decrease in FF results in the decrease of the PCE from 5.13% to 4.86%. The IPCE spectra of PTB7:PC71BM based IOSCs are shown in Fig. 2f. It is observed that the 5.03 at% GZO device showed a maximum IPCE of 70%, which is higher than 57% of the ZnO device. The Jsc values have been calculated by IPCE data with an AM1.5G reference spectrum. The Jsc is found to be 13.77, 13.87, 14.74, 15.42, 14.43 and 13.72 mA cm−2 for ZnO, 1.5, 3.60, 5.03, 7.12 and 9.08 at% GZO respectively. These values match well with those obtained from J–V measurement (Table 1). The dark J–V characteristics shown in Fig. S2(b) and (e) shows that the GZO device exhibited excellent diode characteristics and lower leakage current under reverse bias than the device based on the ZnO.
Another factor influencing the performance of these devices is the interfacial morphology properties. Fig. S3 shows the surface morphology of ZnO and GZO thin films. It is observed that grains are small and are uniformly distributed throughout the surface. These results indicate that increasing Ga-doping concentration degrades the crystallinity of the ZnO thin films due to the formation of small crystallites in the films. The surface topography of the buffer layer, such as ZnO and GZO, may influence the ETLs/active-layer contact. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of ZnO and GZO films with different doping concentrations are shown in Fig. S4. It reveals that the films are uniform without any cracks and are continuous with very well connected grains. The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness is found to be 2.69, 1.12, 0.83, 0.82, 0.80 and 0.76 nm for ZnO, 1.50, 3.60, 5.03, 7.12 and 9.08 at% GZO respectively. The ZnO film above 2 nm and, at the same time, the ZnO show larger particle size, Fig. S5 and 6. The smoother surface should enable a more uniform interfacial contact between the ETLs and active layers, which could increase the electron collection efficiency. The higher surface roughness may indicate non-uniform coverage, which may in turn affect the contact resistance. It is observed that the morphology improvement of the electron transporting interface after doping is responsible for the better performance of the device.
The use of metal oxides on both sides of the PTB7:PC71BM layer prevents the diffusion of moisture into the active layer. The stability of the inverted PTB7:PC71BM solar cells (with MoO3 as the hole transport layer and ZnO or GZO as the electron transport layer) is shown in Fig. 3. The solar cells were exposed continuously to air at room temperature (without any encapsulation barrier). We observe that ZnO almost retains its original efficiency even after 25 days under ambient conditions, only degrading from 5.31 to 4.94%, while the devices using 5.03 at% GZO ETL degrade from 7.34% to 6.92% under the same conditions. This directly shows that ZnO and GZO based devices have a higher stability.

In conclusion, high performance IOSCs have been fabricated using various donor polymers (PCDTBT and PTB7) by incorporating high-quality metal oxides such as ZnO and GZO as ETLs. The 5.03 at% GZO film showed the best efficiencies of 5.56% and 7.34% for PCDTBT and PTB7 polymers respectively. The results confirm that the PTB7 polymer is a promising class of materials for developing high-performance solar cells.


In the present study, GZO nanocrystalline thin films have been prepared using a sol–gel spin coating method. Zinc acetate dihydrate (CH3COO)2 Zn·2H2O (0.25 M) and gallium(III) nitrate hydrate (Ga (NO3)3·xH2O) (0.01 M, 0.03 M, 0.05 M, 0.07 M and 0.09 M) were dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and ethanolamine (H2NCH2CH2OH) (0.25 M) at room temperature. The resultant solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 2 h to yield a homogeneous, clear and transparent solution. The spin coating method was used to prepare thin films of GZO on ITO substrates using the prepared sol. GZO thin films of thickness 30 nm were formed after post-annealing at 450 °C for 2 h and these films formed the GZO nanocrystalline thin films. GZO films with different doping concentrations were prepared.


Inverted organic solar cells were constructed with a device structure of the ITO/GZO/active layer/MoO3/Al. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by a sequence of sonication in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water respectively for 15 minutes and UV-ozone cleaning for 10 minutes. A thin layer of GZO was spin coated onto the ITO substrates and annealed at 450 °C for 2 hours in air. The GZO substrates were transferred into a glove box. The active layer solution was prepared by mixing PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4 by weight) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The PTB7:PC71BM blend solution was prepared with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene–1,8-diiodooctane (97:3 vol%). The active layer (PCDTBT:PC71BM or PTB7:PC71BM) was then spin-coated on the GZO layer and the thickness was about 70 nm in the two low-band gap polymer systems. After that the organic layer was slowly dried in a vacuum, a layer of MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) as an electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the active layer through a shadow mask under a pressure of ∼10−6 Torr. The effective area of the device was measured to be 0.0196 cm2.

X-ray diffraction studies were carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (New D8 Advance); surface morphology and energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) (Fig. S7) of the samples were studied using a Zeiss Supra 55VP field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM); surface topography was studied using atomic force microscopy (Park systems, XE-100); high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the prepared ZnO and GZO were recorded using a JEM-3010 Electron Microscope and the optical properties were studied using the absorbance spectra recorded using a Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer. The thickness of the films was measured using a Dektak XT surface profiler. The layer thickness of ZnO was found to be 30 nm and the thicknesses of 1.50, 3.60, 5.03, 7.12 and 9.08 at% GZO were found to be 29, 31, 30, 33 and 32 nm respectively. Electrical resistivity measurements were carried out using the current–voltage (I–V) measurement. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were recorded using a Keithley 237 source measurement unit using a 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport, 91160A). Light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell as a reference. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were measured by using a lock-in amplifier (Model 7265, Signal Recovery) and monochromatic light from a xenon lamp through the monochromator (SpectroPro-150, Acton Research Corporation).
