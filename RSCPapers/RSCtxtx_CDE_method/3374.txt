Tandem perovskite solar cells are an effective concept to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit of a single-junction perovskite solar cell. For a high-performance tandem cell, besides a wide-bandgap perovskite top cell, a high-quality low-bandgap perovskite bottom cell with an optimum bandgap of ∼1.2 eV is urgently needed. Moreover, a simple process technique needs to be developed for a high-quality perovskite film with good reproducibility, in order to further simplify the whole tandem-cell fabrication. Accordingly, we develop a simple one-step process (vacuum-assisted thermal annealing) for a high-quality low-bandgap CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film, where the absorption edge can exceed 1000 nm. After comparing CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x films annealed in a vacuum and in a nitrogen environment, we find that vacuum-assisted thermal annealing can result in CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x films with better film coverage and crystallinity. This process can also accelerate the sublimation of methylammonium chloride and reduce the trap density in the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film. With this process, we successfully fabricated an efficient low-bandgap perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of more than 12% and good device reproducibility as well as long-term stability.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have achieved dramatic progress in recent years, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been boosted remarkably from 3.8% to a certified 22.7%. The tandem solar cell is a proven concept to further improve the efficiency of PVSCs beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit of single-junction solar cells, and it consists ideally of a low-bandgap (around 0.9 to 1.2 eV) bottom cell and a wide-bandgap (around 1.7 to 1.9 eV) top cell. The mixed lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) iodide perovskites of CH3NH3SnyPb1−yI3 exhibit bandgaps from 1.20 to 1.58 eV, whilst the Pb mixed iodide and bromine perovskites of CH3NH3PbIxBr3−x can cover bandgaps from 1.58 to 2.20 eV. The compositional versatility of the perovskite family presents a good opportunity to develop perovskite–perovskite tandem cells, which have great merit for commercialization because of their cost effectiveness and facile solution processability. Although the development of wide-bandgap PVSCs has progressed well, the demonstration of perovskite–perovskite tandem cells is limited because of the challenges in the development of highly efficient low-bandgap PVSCs. Substitution of Pb with Sn has been the most widely used approach to reduce the bandgap of perovskites. Jen and co-workers reported low-bandgap perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3SnyPb1−yIxCl3−x. Perovskites with bandgaps of 1.38 eV and 1.33 eV, respectively, were fabricated by tuning the ratio between Sn and Pb, and the corresponding devices reached respective PCEs of 10% and 14.2%. Li et al. also reported an MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite solar cell with a bandgap of 1.17 eV and a decent PCE of up to 13.6%. By mixing FASnI3 and MAPbI3 together, Yan and co-workers reported a perovskite solar cell of 15% PCE with a bandgap of around 1.25 eV. In addition, Snaith, McGehee and co-workers successfully fabricated an all-perovskite tandem solar cell with a top cell of 1.8 eV – wide-bandgap FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3 and a bottom cell of 1.2 eV – low-bandgap FA0.75Cs0.25Pb0.5Sn0.5I3, and their best low-bandgap device produced a PCE of 14.8%. Yan and co-workers reported all-perovskite four-terminal tandem solar cells based on a 1.58 eV – wide-bandgap top cell and a 1.25 eV – low-bandgap bottom cell. The maximum PCE of the low-bandgap solar cell reached 17.6%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of up to 0.85 V. It can be seen from these previous developments that low-bandgap PVSCs that contain Sn continue to suffer from inferior PCEs due to the intrinsic facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and poor film quality. The latter, which plays an important role in the photovoltaic performance of PVSCs, is in turn dependent upon the deposition techniques and subsequent treatments used. Therefore, effective methods are urgently needed to improve the film quality of Sn-containing perovskites towards highly efficient low-bandgap PVSCs.

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that the vacuum-assisted thermal annealing (VATA) process could be applied to effectively modulate the quality of the low-bandgap CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film. Unlike conventional thermal annealing methods inside an N2-filled glovebox, the VATA process accelerated the sublimation of methylammonium chloride (MACl), which affected the crystallization process of the pre-deposited CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film. As a result, a compact CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x perovskite film with higher crystallinity and better coverage was realized, and the corresponding inverted planar heterojunction PVSCs exhibited greater photocurrent and photovoltage output owing to the reduced leakage path and suppressed carrier recombination in the perovskite films. By the introduction of the VATA process, the average Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor and PCE of the low-bandgap CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x PVSCs were found to increase simultaneously to 0.70 V and 24.7 mA cm−2 and 71.1% and 12.3%, respectively. This simple and effective strategy of the VATA process to prepare good performance low-bandgap PVSC will benefit the future construction of perovskite–perovskite tandem solar cells.

To prepare the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x precursor solution, CH3NH3I, PbI2 (Alfa Aesar) and SnCl2 (Alfa Aesar) were mixed in dimethylformamide with a modified solution formula (molar ratio, 4:1:1) at 40 wt% and stirred at 60 °C overnight in a glovebox.


The patterned ITO-coated glass was cleaned by sonication in detergent, de-ionised water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried at 80 °C in a baking oven, followed by a 4 min oxygen plasma treatment. A 40 nm-thick layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP AI 4083) was spun cast onto the ITO substrate and dried for 20 min at 150 °C. The perovskite precursor solution was then spun cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer, resulting in a composite film with a nominal thickness of around 350 nm. The film was then further annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a vacuum environment (1000 Pa) or in an N2-filled glovebox to promote the crystallisation of the perovskite. An 80 nm-thick PC61BM was then spun cast onto the perovskite layer, followed by the deposition of Phen-NaDPO (3 nm) at 0.1 A s−1. Finally, 100 nm of silver was thermally evaporated onto the substrates through a shadow mask. The overlapping area between the cathode and the anode defined the device area of 0.04 cm2.


Ultraviolet-visible light absorptions were recorded on an HP8453 spectrophotometer. The SEM images were obtained with a Zeiss EVO 18 scanning electron microscope. The crystalline structure of the perovskite films was investigated with an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X'pert PRO) equipped with a Cu-Kα X-ray tube. For the photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) measurements, perovskite films were deposited on quartz substrates. Monochromatic light chopped at 13 Hz as the pump beam was applied to shine onto the samples. Meanwhile, a probe laser was placed on the perpendicular side and a position sensitive sensor connected with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research, Model SR830) was placed on the opposite side to detect the deflection signals.


The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 air mass, 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination with a solar simulator (Taiwan, Enlitech, SS-F5). The light intensity was calibrated with a National Renewable Energy Laboratory-calibrated silicon photodiode with a KG5 filter. Measurements of the EQE spectra were performed on a commercial QE measurement system (QE-R3011, Enlitech). For the transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent measurements, the device was serially connected to a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052C), and the input impedance of the oscilloscope was set to 1 MΩ and 50 MΩ, respectively, to form the open- and short-circuit conditions. The transient photovoltage was measured under 0.3 Sun illumination. An attenuated laser pulse (0.54 μJ cm−2; 530 nm) was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination. The transient photocurrent of the devices was measured by applying 530 nm laser pulses with a pulse width of 120 fs and a low pulse energy to the short-circuited devices in the dark. The laser pulses were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier, with a pulse energy of 1.3 mJ at 800 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz (SpectraPhysics Spitfire Ace). The time resolution of the overall measurement is near 1 ns. The light-dependent Voc and Jsc measurements were performed under the J–V measurement system, and the light intensity was modulated from 0.1 sun to 1 sun.


It has been reported that the bandgaps of the CH3NH3SnyPb1−yIxCl3−x perovskite do not follow a linear trend of modulating the ratio between Sn and Pb in a perovskite lattice. The smallest bandgap of around 1.2 eV is indeed obtained by adding equimolar amounts of Pb and Sn with a perovskite structure of CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x, where absorption can extend to the infrared range (around 1050 nm). The suitable bandgap of CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x makes it a promising bottom-cell material in a tandem device, which led us to focus our study on CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x PVSCs. As shown in Fig. S1, compared with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3SnIxCl3−x, a CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin film showed an absorption edge of up to 1050 nm, which is in good agreement with the results of previous reports. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements shown in Fig. S1b and morphological characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shown in Fig. S2 revealed that the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin film obtained much better crystallinity and film quality than the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CH3NH3SnIxCl3−x thin films.

The thermal annealing process for Pb-based perovskite films is proven to be critical in controlling the crystal formation and film morphology, and have been widely studied to improve the device performance. It can be expected that the annealing conditions are also critical in achieving high-performance CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x solar cells. Therefore, we attempted to control the environment during the annealing process to control the crystallization of perovskites and hence modulate the overall quality of the perovskite thin film. Generally, because of the sensitivity of Sn2+ to oxygen, the annealing process of Sn-based PVSCs was carried out in an N2-filled glovebox. In addition, inspired by previous reports that annealing in a vacuum could promote better crystallization of Pb-based perovskite, we hence compared the annealing environments of vacuum and nitrogen to further study their effects on the quality of the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin film and on the performance of the corresponding devices.

Fig. 1 shows the morphologies of CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x films annealed in a vacuum and nitrogen environments. The pristine film without any annealing showed a relatively poor morphology with irregularly distributed grains, which are in the form of an intermediate phase of perovskites and will be further discussed later. When the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film was annealed for 0.5 h under vacuum, it started to show a clearer crystal shape, suggesting the formation of a well crystallized perovskite film. However, some small pinholes were found in the film (marked with red circles), which might increase the leakage current in a solar cell device. When we annealed the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film for 1 h, we obtained a full-coverage perovskite film that is suitable for solar cell applications. The distinct crystal shape with a sharp edge illustrated the formation of a highly regular CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x crystal with excellent crystal quality. However, if we further extended the annealing time to 1.5 h, the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film continued to grow into larger crystals and exhibited a poor film morphology with a large number of holes. In contrast, when annealed under the nitrogen environment, the coverage of the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film annealed for 0.5 h was lower and the crystal quality is poorer than the film annealed under vacuum. This may be due to the incomplete conversion of perovskites. When we annealed the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film for 1 h, although a higher coverage film was obtained, small pinholes were still found in the film (marked with red circles). Moreover, the smooth crystal edge also suggests that the crystal quality here was lower than that of the film annealed under vacuum. Again, when we extended the annealing time to 1.5 h, a low-coverage film with large holes was obtained. Therefore, it was obvious that regardless of whether the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin film was annealed in a vacuum or in a nitrogen environment, an annealing time of 1 h was optimal to achieve a high-coverage film that requires for solar cell fabrication.
To further investigate the crystal quality of the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin films annealed in various environments, we used XRD to characterize the films. Fig. 2 shows that the XRD results agree well with the SEM images discussed above. In the pristine film without any annealing, several peaks show at 2θ of around 12.7°, 14.1°, 14.9°, 15.5°, 28.5° and 30.0°. Among them, peaks at 2θ of 12.7°, 14.1° and 28.5° refer to PbI2, (110) and (220) planes of the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x lattice, respectively, which is in good agreement with the results of previous reports. While the extra XRD peaks at 14.9°, 15.5° and 30.0° can be assigned to the signal from the intermediate phase of perovskites. For the samples annealed under vacuum, an increase in the diffraction intensity of (110) and (220) planes with annealing time was observed, which suggested that a higher crystallinity of the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin film was obtained. However, for the samples that were annealed under the nitrogen environment, the overall crystal quality of the perovskite films is worse than those annealed in a vacuum. Especially in the case with an annealing time of 0.5 h, the perovskite film contained two extra small peaks at 12.7° and 15.5°, which could be attributed to PbI2 and an intermediate phase of perovskites, respectively. These results suggest that the precursor materials did not fully convert to CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x in such a short annealing time in the nitrogen environment. It also proved that the VATA process could facilitate better conversion of precursor materials into the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x perovskite. In addition, according to Fig. 2c, we extracted the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of (110) planes of the perovskite thin films annealed in various annealing environments. We found that the FWHM of (110) plane in the vacuum-annealed film is smaller than that in the nitrogen-annealed film, reflecting that a narrower distribution of the crystal size was achieved by the VATA process. And we attributed these results to the larger sublimation rate of MACl, which promotes the formation of a homogeneous film and will be discussed later.
Achieving the pure phase of CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x perovskite is important to the performance of the solar cells. To further confirm the complete conversion of precursor materials into the pure CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x perovskite, energy dispersive spectrometry was carried out for quantitative evaluation of the elemental concentration in the perovskite films. Table S1 shows that the ratio of Pb:Sn:I was around 1:1:6 in every case, in addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements also confirmed that there was negligible Cl signal detected in the perovskite film prepared by the VATA process, which confirmed that the composition of the resultant film is CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3. However, when the film was annealed in the nitrogen environment, a relatively high Cl concentration was observed in the film. We attributed that such residual chloride is left in the perovskite film as a form of MACl, which became one of the by-products during the formation of the perovskite film. Based on the formula of our precursor solution, we could describe the conversion using the following equation:
(2x − 2)MAI + PbI2 + SnCl2 → 2MASn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x + (2x − 4)MACl
(1)
It has been reported that residual MACl in the perovskite film can act as an impurity and reduce the performance of PVSCs. In addition, the residual MACl will probably affect the device stability because it may sublime within a working solar cell due to its low sublimation temperature. However, it is possible to remove MACl from the perovskite film by thermal annealing, resulting in a purer perovskite film. In our case, it was difficult to remove MACl thoroughly by sublimation when annealed under the N2 environment even when the annealing time increased to 1.5 h (as shown by the energy-dispersive spectrometry data in Table S1). Comparatively, as shown in Fig. 3a, the VATA process accelerates the removal of MACl with an undetectable signal of the Cl within only 0.5 h of annealing, which is expected to form a better-quality perovskite film that requires to improve the solar cell performance. In addition, there is a competition between the generation rate and the sublimation rate of MACl. Xie et al. reported that if the generation rate became larger than the sublimation rate, MACl will precipitate in the perovskite film first and gradually sublimates during the annealing process, which then led to the formation of pinholes in the perovskite film. If the generation rate became smaller than the sublimation rate, MACl will sublimate once it is formed, resulting in a pinhole-free film. Therefore, the VATA process, which dramatically accelerates the sublimation rate of MACl, facilitates the formation of a higher-quality CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film with better coverage and crystallinity.
To evaluate the influence of the annealing environment on device performance, we fabricated CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x perovskite solar cells with the device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/Phen-NaDPO/Ag (as shown in Fig. 3a). Phen-NaDPO was used as a cathode interfacial material as it has been proven to be an efficient cathode interlayer for organic solar cells. According to the J–V curve shown in Fig. 3b and the device performance summarized in Table 1, the devices fabricated with the VATA process resulted in better Voc, Jsc and fill factors compared to the devices annealed under the nitrogen environment, leading to PCE improvement from 10.2% to 12.3%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) shown in Fig. 3c proved that the devices fabricated by the VATA process had a higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, which was in good agreement with the higher Jsc value. In addition, we attributed the better Voc and fill factor for the device fabricated by the VATA process to the following reasons: first, the higher coverage and crystallinity in the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film resulted in increased shunt resistance (Rp) and decreased leakage current, as shown in Fig. 3d. Second, the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film with better crystallinity and purer phase without residual MACl resulted in less recombination loss of photo-excited charge-carriers in the film, which is supported by a combination of carrier recombination and extraction characterization techniques and will be discussed below. More encouragingly, compared with PVSCs fabricated in a nitrogen environment, those fabricated by the VATA process obtained more stable continuous output (as shown in Fig. 3e), less hysteresis (as shown in Fig. S4a) and better device reproducibility (as shown in Fig. S4b). Also, the best CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x solar cell maintained over 70% of its initial performance after storage in a N2-filled glovebox over 3 weeks. These results were comparable to the long-term stability of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x solar cell, as shown in Fig. S5.

In order to provide a better understanding on the positive effects induced by the VATA process on the device performance from the view of carrier recombination and extraction, a series of studies including transient photovoltage and photocurrent, and light intensity dependent Voc and Jsc analysis were performed. Recombination of photo-excited charge-carriers is a reverse process of charge generation, which retards the charge extraction process and limits the final performance of PVSCs. Generally, transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent are well-known techniques to study the charge recombination and charge extraction properties in PVSCs, respectively. Therefore, we adopted such techniques to evaluate the charge recombination and extraction properties of CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x solar cells fabricated in vacuum and nitrogen annealing environments. According to the transient photovoltage measurements shown in Fig. 4a, a longer charge-recombination lifetime was observed in the device fabricated with the VATA process, indicating a lower charge recombination rate in such a device. We ascribed this result to the better crystallinity of the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin film and the absence of residual MACl, because both could reduce the trap states in the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x thin film. In addition, according to the transient photocurrent measurements shown in Fig. 4b, a shorter charge-extraction time was observed in the device fabricated with the VATA process, which indicates that a homogeneous coverage film with fewer traps was beneficial for charge extraction. These results were also in consistent with the achievement of a higher Jsc and a better EQE in the PVSCs fabricated with the VATA process.
Typically, there are two main recombination processes in perovskite solar cells (i.e., monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination), which can be understood by the dependence of Voc and Jsc on light intensity. Fig. 4c shows that the relationship between Voc and the natural logarithm of light intensity (i.e., ln(I)), the slopes of the solar cell fabricated by the VATA process and the nitrogen annealing process are measured to be 1.21 kbT/q and 1.41 kbT/q, respectively, where kb is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and q is the elementary charge. Generally, a slope of 1 kbT/q represents that the recombination process is dominant by bimolecular recombination, while the slope tends to be 2 kbT/q when monomolecular recombination (or trap-assisted recombination) is involved. Therefore, we were able to analyze semiquantitively how severely the device suffered from monomolecular recombination by the slope deviation from 1 kbT/q. The smaller slope represented that the monomolecular recombination was suppressed by the VATA process in our case. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4d, in the relationship between Jsc and light intensity, although both cases exhibited linear dependence of Jsc on light intensity, the slope of the vacuum-annealed device (0.998) was closer to 1 when compared with the nitrogen-annealed device (1.03). These results suggest that the degree of bimolecular recombination is also smaller in the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x solar cells fabricated with the VATA process.
It has been reported that monomolecular recombination is dominant by trap-assisted recombination in a three-dimensional bulk perovskite and that the energy disorder of the active layer may cause greater Voc loss. Therefore, we performed highly sensitive photothermal deflection spectroscopy to study the sub-bandgap optical absorption of the perovskite films in order to evaluate the trap density and energetic disorder of the studied CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x films. The slope of the absorption tail below the bandgap is related to the Urbach energy, which is used to describe the energetic disorder of the film. Fig. 5 shows that the film annealed in a vacuum obtained a lower Urbach energy of 39.8 meV, compared with 44.6 meV for the film annealed in nitrogen. The lower Urbach energy indicated less energetic disorder in the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film. In the meanwhile, the CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x film annealed in a vacuum environment also had a lower sub-bandgap absorption coefficient, revealing that the film had a lower trap density, which also suggested that the residual MACl may introduce defects in perovskite films. The results also correlate very well with the fact that CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x PVSCs fabricated with the VATA process suffered from weaker monomolecular recombination.

We have demonstrated an efficient low-bandgap CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x perovskite solar cell based on a vacuum-assisted annealing process. After combining the characterization techniques of XRD, SEM, energy-dispersive spectrometry and photo-induced thermal diffraction spectroscopy, we clearly revealed that the VATA process not only improved the morphology and crystallinity of the film, but also accelerated the sublimation of undesired MACl during the annealing process and hence reduced trap states. CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5IxCl3−x perovskite solar cells fabricated with the VATA process obtained a much higher PCE of 12.3% and better device reproducibility than the cells fabricated in a nitrogen environment. We attributed such enhanced performance to an improvement in suppression of charge recombination and better charge extraction properties. Such high-performance low-bandgap perovskite solar cells may promote progress in the development of perovskite tandem solar cells.
