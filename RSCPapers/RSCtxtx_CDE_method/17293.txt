Two regioisomeric wide-band-gap donor polymers with different fluorine topologies are designed and synthesized for use in nonfullerene organic solar cells (NFOSCs). Two fluorine atoms are substituted on the phenylene moiety in an anti (PTBDD2F-a) or a syn (PTBDD2F-s) fashion. The two isomeric polymers show nearly identical optical, thermal, and electrochemical properties, but exhibit different interchain packing and film morphologies in both pristine and blend films with an n-type acceptor (ITIC). These different morphological properties are related to differences in the molecular dipole, symmetry, and backbone curvatures of PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s, which influence the interchain packing and resulting electrical properties. From grazing incidence X-ray scattering measurements, PTBDD2F-a:ITIC shows more pronounced and two separate out-of-plane (010) peaks compared to PTBDD2F-s:ITIC, suggesting a stronger face-on cofacial packing of ITIC molecules in the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC blend. A higher domain purity (1.00 vs. 0.71) is also observed for PTBDD2F-a:ITIC compared to PTBDD2F-s:ITIC in the resonant soft X-ray scattering measurements. These different morphological features induce ∼2.5 times higher hole mobility and ∼6 times higher electron mobility with higher power conversion efficiency (6.60 vs. 5.47%) for PTBDD2F-a:ITIC than for PTBDD2F-s:ITIC. This comparative study highlights the effects of different fluorine topologies along the polymer backbone, which should be carefully considered to optimize the blend morphology and optoelectronic properties of NFOSCs.

In recent decades, the design of semi-crystalline π-conjugated polymers with planar chains and condensed packing structures has attracted significant attention for applications in organic optoelectronic devices due to their light weight, easily tunable molecular structures, and solution processability for large-area flexible devices. In particular, donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymeric structures have been extensively studied for use in fullerene- and nonfullerene-based organic solar cells (NFOSCs). Unlike fullerene-based OSCs, which require low-band-gap (LBG, <1.6 eV) polymer donors, NFOSCs can utilize wide-band-gap (WBG, >1.8 eV) polymers. The WBG donors can complement the light absorption of LBG n-type nonfullerene acceptors, such as a naphthalene diimide-based polymer acceptor (N2200), 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC), or 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDIC), thereby increasing solar harvesting. This benefit of NFOSCs led to a remarkable improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 14%. To further increase the PCE value, it is necessary to optimize the molecular structure of the WBG copolymers. In principle, in order to develop WBG copolymers, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of the polymers should be finely modulated by combining weak donor and acceptor units in the polymer backbone while maintaining suitable frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels and crystalline interchain organization. In this context, the incorporation of highly electronegative substituents, e.g., fluorine, into the donor segments has been suggested as an effective strategy, by which the electron sufficiency of the donor unit can decrease effectively, resulting in weak ICT interaction and subsequent increase in the band gap of the resulting polymers. In addition, the incorporation of fluorine atoms into the polymer backbone can simultaneously induce intra- and/or interchain noncovalent coulombic interactions, which promote backbone planarity and thus crystalline interchain organization with enhanced charge mobility.

Recently, Yan et al. have synthesized two WBG donor polymers (PTFB-O and PTFB-P) and successfully demonstrated highly efficient NFOSCs with a PCE of 10.9%. They intentionally reduced polymer crystallinity by utilizing the mirror symmetry of the monomer PTFB-O. However, it remains unclear why a minor difference in the position of the fluorine along the polymer backbone significantly affects the electrical and photovoltaic properties. In parallel to regioisomeric polymers, similar approaches have been reported in the system of small molecules having different fluorine topologies by Bazan and our groups. The introduction of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents in different topological geometries induces changes in the local molecular orbital distribution, molecular symmetry, and resulting molecular dipole. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of the substituent topology on the structural, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the D–A alternating polymers.
In this paper, we report two regioisomeric WBG donor copolymers (PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s) based on thiophene and 5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) with different fluorine topologies (anti-/syn-symmetry) on the polymer main chain. We systematically investigated the effects of the different fluorine topologies on their backbone linearity, polymer packing and optoelectronic properties. PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s show a different molecular symmetry in the fluorinated phenylene, and their different symmetries induce different chain curvatures. This difference affects the interchain interactions and crystalline packing properties of the polymers as well as their blend morphology with the ITIC acceptor in the film, which significantly influences the resulting electrical and photoactive characteristics.


Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of the two isomeric donor polymers PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s and the small molecular acceptor (ITIC); the detailed synthetic routes to two polymers are depicted in Scheme S1. The two D–A-type conjugated polymers are based on the electron-deficient 5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione moiety with two flanking 2-ethylhexylthiophenes, where the four ethylhexyl side chains ensure sufficient solubility of the final polymers. For the electron-rich unit, we utilized a 1,4-bis(thiophen-2-yl)phenylene unit substituted with two fluorine atoms, which decrease the electron sufficiency and the resulting ICT interaction along the polymeric backbone to increase the band gap. The different symmetries of fluorine substitution onto phenylene in PTBDD2F-a (anti/C2-symmetric) and PTBDD2F-s (syn/mirror-symmetric) not only control the relative orientation of the adjacent thiophene rings via noncovalent H⋯F (or S⋯F) coulombic interactions, but also influence the chain curvature, interchain dipole–dipole interactions, and intermolecular organization in the solid state.

The synthesis of the polymers is described in detail in the Experimental section. Briefly, the polymerization of the two WBG copolymers was carried out via the microwave-assisted Stille coupling of 1,3-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (M1) and 1,4-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-difluorobenzene (M2) or 1,4-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,3-difluorobenzene (M3) catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4 in toluene (>60% yield). Both copolymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the dispersity (Đ) of PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s were determined to be 31 kDa and 4.8, and 28 kDa and 3.7, respectively, by gel permeation chromatography using o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 80 °C (Table 1).

The torsional profiles between the difluorinated phenylene and thiophene moieties, minimum energy conformation, and frontier orbital structures of the two copolymers were calculated using density functional theory (DFT; Jaguar quantum chemistry software, B3LYP/6-31G** level). For simplicity, methyl substituents (in place of the four ethylhexyl side chains) were considered for all the structures. The torsional angles between difluorinated phenylene (anti-/syn-symmetry) and thiophene confirm their co-planarity in both polymers (Fig. S1).

Such chain planarity is beneficial for achieving a highly ordered interchain organization. The minimum energy conformations by DFT calculation show that two adjacent thiophene rings next to phenylene are oriented to be opposite to each other in PTBDD2F-a; in contrast, the adjacent thiophene units are oriented in the same direction in PTBDD2F-s. This is well consistent with Yan's report (PTFB-P versus PTFB-O). This suggests that noncovalent coulombic H⋯F interactions are considered to be a main stabilizing factor. However, because H⋯F and S⋯F coulombic interactions are calculated to be similarly strong, we expect that the interplay of both interactions along the conjugated backbone induces the planarity of the polymer chain. Interestingly, although both polymers are predicted to be fairly planar, the different fluorine topologies may induce different chain curvatures. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, a quasi-linear backbone is predicted for PTBDD2F-a. However, a wavy curvature is calculated for PTBDD2F-s. The different chain curvatures of the two isomeric polymers may induce different interchain packing and bulk film morphologies, influencing their electrical properties. Despite their different chain curvatures, the FMO levels of PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s were calculated to be nearly identical, with values of −4.91 and −4.93 eV and −2.55 and −2.54 eV for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), respectively (Fig. 2c and 2d).


Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the two copolymers in chlorobenzene and in thin film, which are summarized in Table 1. Both PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s show two absorption bands. The high-energy absorption peak below ∼350 nm is attributed to a π–π* transition, and the low-energy absorption band in the range of 350–640 nm is assigned to an ICT interaction. Both polymers present a vibronic shoulder peak in solution, suggesting their pre-aggregation even in solution, due to the high chain planarity and strong interchain interactions. In the films, the absorption spectra of the two copolymers are red-shifted by ∼40 nm with a pronounced vibronic shoulder peak at 597 nm, showing complementary light absorption with ITIC. Based on the absorption onset in the films, the optical band gap was determined to be ∼1.9 eV for both polymers. The two regioisomeric polymers showed similar spectra, suggesting that the different F topologies did not significantly influence the optical absorption. A similar trend in the optical properties of two regioisomeric polymers (PTFB-O and PTFB-P) was also found in Yan's recent report, in spite of the different F topologies in the polymeric system. Furthermore, there was no distinct difference in the molar absorption coefficient values (∼5.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1) for both polymers in chlorobenzene. In the case of the film state, PTBDD2F-a (7.1 × 104 cm−1) showed slightly higher absorption than PTBDD2F-s (6.8 × 104 cm−1) at each absorption maximum wavelength as shown in Fig. S2. The slightly stronger light absorption of PTBDD2F-a may be related to the tighter interchain packing in the film compared to PTBDD2F-s, which will be discussed in detail in the following section.

To investigate the electrochemical properties, we performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S3). The HOMO energy level was determined to be −5.49 eV for both polymers, assuming that the energy level of ferrocene is −4.8 eV relative to the vacuum level. The LUMO levels were calculated to be −3.61 and −3.60 eV for PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s, respectively, using the HOMO value and the corresponding optical band gap of the film. The experimental energy levels were consistent with the FMO levels from the theoretical calculations. Thus, the F topology did not have significant influences on the FMO energy levels of PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s. In contrast, in a regioisomeric small molecular system (Prox-FBT vs. Dis-FBT), significant F topology effects were observed, with the optical band gaps differing by ∼0.1 eV (1.77 vs. 1.87 eV for Prox-FBT vs. Dis-FBT). Dis-FBT had a deeper HOMO (−5.39 eV) than Prox-FBT (−5.16 eV) due to the presence of a nonbonding or antibonding character in the C–F bonding depending on the F substitution position. Based on the different F topology effects in the regioisomeric small molecular and polymeric systems, the local electron distribution and the resulting molecular dipole caused by varying the F topology clearly influenced the optical and electrochemical properties of the small molecular system. In the case of polymers, these effects may be diluted by the complicated interactions along the long polymeric chain.
Fig. S4 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. The onset decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s were determined to be 412 and 400 °C, demonstrating the high thermal stability of both WBG copolymers. The DSC measurement shows clear endothermic and exothermic peaks at 240 and 217 °C for PTBDD2F-a and at 238 and 217 °C for PTBDD2F-s. These peaks correspond to melting and crystallization temperatures, which suggests the presence of strong interchain interactions.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the PTBDD2F polymers with different fluorine topologies, NFOSC devices were fabricated with a conventional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/LiF/Al architecture. We optimized the NFOSC devices by varying the processing solvent, blend ratio, and solvent additive. Both devices were optimized under identical conditions: a blend ratio of 1:1 (w/w) and 16 mg mL−1 (polymer + ITIC) in chlorobenzene with 0.5 vol% of the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic characteristics of the PTBDD2F:ITIC devices measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar illumination. Fig. 4a and b show the current density versus voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized PTBDD2F:ITIC devices. The PTBDD2F-a device showed a PCE of 6.60% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 13.24 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.96 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.49; its photovoltaic performance was clearly superior to that of PTBDD2F-s (a PCE of 5.47% with a JSC of 11.68 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.96 V, and an FF of 0.46). Fig. 4a shows that the enhanced PCE of the PTBDD2F-a NFOSC is mainly due to the improvement in JSC, which shows a good agreement with the EQE profile. Both devices showed the same VOC values because of their similar HOMO levels. In the EQE profiles, the NFOSCs show photo-responses in the range of 300–800 nm. In particular, PTBDD2F-a:ITIC achieved higher EQE values than PTBDD2F-s:ITIC in the 320 to 500 nm and 550 to 750 nm regions, which matches well with the absorption spectra of the PTBDD2F:ITIC blend films in Fig. S2.

The vertical hole and electron mobilities in the pristine and blend films were investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5). In the pristine films, PTBDD2F-a showed two times higher hole mobility than PTBDD2F-s (1.4 × 10−4vs. 6.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC blend also had 2.5-fold higher hole mobility than the PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blend (5.2 × 10−5vs. 2.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher hole mobility in both the pristine and blend films of PTBDD2F-a can be attributed to the stronger interchain packing of PTBDD2F-a with a more linear polymer backbone compared to PTBDD2F-s. In addition, the electron mobilities of the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC and PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blend films were determined to be 5.1 × 10−5 and 8.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The 6 times higher electron mobility of the PTBDD2F-a blend films correlates well with the higher domain purity and crystallinity of PTBDD2F-a in the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology, which will be discussed in the following section. Consequently, the enhanced charge carrier mobility in the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC BHJs is beneficial for producing efficient charge transport and collection, and thus the higher JSC and PCE of the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC device.


In order to understand the difference in the charge transport and photovoltaic performances of PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s devices, we investigated the film morphology, interchain ordering, and phase separation in blend films by combined measurements of grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS), resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Fig. 5 shows the GIXS images and the corresponding line-cut profiles. The detailed crystalline packing and molecular orientations were investigated in both the pristine and blend films. In the pristine films, PTBDD2F-a showed lamellar and π–π stacking distances of 18.4 and 3.70 Å, respectively, which are shorter than those (19.2 and 3.81 Å) of PTBDD2F-s. This feature is intriguing since both PTBDD2F-a and PTBDD2F-s have identical alkyl chain lengths (ethylhexyl) in their backbones. The tighter interchain packing of PTBDD2F-a is expected because of the linear backbone curvature in contrast to the PTBDD2F-s, which has a wavy backbone structure. Next, we examined the packing structures in BHJ blend films with ITIC (Fig. 5c and d). Interestingly, there are clear differences in the scattering features between the two blend films: more pronounced scattering peaks were observed from the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC blend in both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions, as compared to the PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blend. We note that these scatterings mainly originate from the crystalline structures of ITIC on the basis of the GIXS results of the ITIC pristine film (Fig. S6). Thus, we can conclude that ITIC acceptors exhibit well-developed crystalline domains in PTBDD2F-a:ITIC compared to those in PTBDD2F-s:ITIC. In addition, we observed that the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC film had more pronounced and two separate (010) peaks of ITIC acceptors in the OOP direction relative to the peaks in the PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blend, which suggests that ITIC forms a stronger face-on cofacial packing in the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC blend. To further compare the packing behaviors of ITIC, the crystal coherence length (CCL) was calculated from the (010) scattering peaks in the OOP direction (Table S1). Two separated OOP (010) peaks in the blend films were obtained by deconvolution with Gaussian fitting. The CCL values of two OOP (010) π–π stacking peaks were calculated to be 63.2 and 94.3 Å for PTBDD2F-a:ITIC, which were higher than those (50.5 and 27.2 Å) for PTBDD2F-s:ITIC. These well-developed ITIC crystalline domains in the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC blend must be advantageous for the production of efficient electron transport.

The phase separation and domain purity of the polymer:ITIC films were examined using RSoXS. The excitation was performed at a photon energy of 288.0 eV to enhance the scattering contrast.Fig. 6 shows the RSoXS profiles of the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC and PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blends as a function of the scattering vector q. Dominant peaks at q = 0.0099 Å−1 and q = 0.0127 Å−1 were observed for the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC and PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blends, respectively. The corresponding domain spacing was determined to be 63.6 and 49.6 nm for PTBDD2F-a:ITIC and PTBDD2F-s:ITIC, respectively, indicating the formation of slightly larger domains in the PTBDD2F-a blend. We note that a more prominent discrepancy is the scattering intensity between two different blends. A significantly higher scattering intensity was observed for PTBDD2F-a:ITIC, indicating a higher domain purity of PTBDD2F-a:ITIC compared to that of the PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blend. The relative domain purity of the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC and PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blends, which is proportional to the square root of the total scattering intensity (TSI) of the scattering profiles, was determined to be 1.00 and 0.71, respectively. The higher surface roughness and clearer phase contrast of the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC blend film in the AFM measurements also support the trend of the RSoXS results (Fig. S7). The higher domain purity of the PTBDD2F-a:ITIC blend may stem from the different crystalline behaviors of the two regioisomeric polymers, as previously studied in other systems. The stronger interchain packing interactions of PTBDD2F-a induce higher domain purity, thus facilitating efficient charge transport in the NFOSC devices. According to Yan's report, the less crystalline PTFB-O yielded higher photovoltaic performance (compared to PTFB-P) in NFOSCs with ITIC acceptors due to the smaller domains and higher PL quenching. This result shows both similar (with regard to phase separation) and opposite (for photovoltaic performance) trends with our measurements. We speculate that it is due to the lower crystallinity of PTBDD2F-a relative to PTFB-P that exhibits strong temperature-dependent aggregation. The adequate (and balanced) crystalline packing of both donor and nonfullerene acceptor is expected to be important in NFOSCS.

In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized two regioisomeric WBG copolymers with different fluorine topologies in the weak donor segments (anti-/syn-symmetry) for NFOSCs. The topology effects of the fluorine substituents on the backbone linearity, optoelectronic properties, interchain packing, and resulting electrical properties were investigated. The different F topologies did not significantly influence the optical, thermal, or FMO electronic properties; however, they had a significant impact on the structural geometry and solid-state interchain packing in the pristine and blend films. Investigations of their packing structure and morphology via RSoXS and GIXS suggest that the PTBDD2F-a polymers had larger crystalline coherence length, and closer π–π stacking in the pristine film and their blend with ITIC, showing the higher domain purity in PTBDD2F-a:ITIC. These combined features led to enhanced charge transport properties in PTBDD2F-a:ITIC compared to those in the PTBDD2F-s:ITIC blend. As a result, the NFOSC based on PTBDD2F-a:ITIC yielded a higher JSC and a resulting PCE of 6.60%. Therefore, our comparative study emphasizes a careful consideration of different substituent topologies for the design of photovoltaic materials to optimize their blend morphology and resulting electrical and photoactive characteristics.


All chemical reagents were purchased from Aldrich, Tokyo Chemical Industry, or Junsei, and were used without further purification. Compound 1 and ITIC were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. in Beijing, China. Compounds 2, 3, and M1–3 were synthesized by following previously reported procedures (Scheme S1). The polymerization was carried out as described below.


In an N2 filled glove box, 1,3-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (M1, 250 mg, 0.252 mmol), 1,4-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-difluorobenzene (M2, 152.3 mg, 0.252 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (2 mol%) and toluene (2.5 mL) were mixed in a 5 mL microwave vial. The reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 3 min, at 100 °C for 5 min, at 135 °C for 45 min, and at 150 °C for 55 min in a microwave reactor. The polymer was end-capped by the addition of 2-tributylstannylthiophene (0.1 equiv.), and then the mixture was further reacted at 145 °C for 20 min. 2-Bromothiophene (0.2 equiv.) was added using a syringe, and the reaction solution was heated at 145 °C for another 20 min. After the reaction was completed, the crude PTBDD2F-a polymer was precipitated into 300 mL methanol, filtered, and further purified by Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene. The extracted polymer in chlorobenzene was precipitated into MeOH, filtered, and dried under vacuum (yield: 62.5%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.62 (br, 2H), 7.44 (br, 4H), 7.23 (br, 2H), 3.33 (br, 8H), 2.78 (br, 8H), 1.80 (br, 8H), 1.51–1.22 (br, 32H), 1.00–0.83 (br, 24H).


The polymer PTBDD2F-s was synthesized in a similar manner to that for PTBDD2F-a. M1 (265.4 mg, 0.268 mmol) and 1,4-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,3-difluorobenzene (M3, 161.7 mg, 0.268 mmol) were reacted using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (2 mol%) as a catalyst in toluene (2.5 mL) in a microwave reactor. The extracted polymer in chlorobenzene was precipitated into MeOH, filtered, and dried under vacuum (yield: 66.2%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.64 (br, 4H), 7.49 (br, 4H), 7.26 (br, 4H), 3.35 (br, 8H), 3.79 (br, 8H), 1.83 (br, 8H), 1.54–1.28 (br, 32H), 1.10–0.80 (br, 24H).
