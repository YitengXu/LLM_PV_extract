In this work, we synthesized novel hole transporting materials (HTMs) and studied their impact on the stability of perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs). The steady-state maximum power output of devices in working condition was monitored to assess the stability and predict the lifetime of PSCs prepared using different HTMs. We showed that the HTM has a significant impact on the device lifetime and found that novel silolothiophene linked methoxy triphenylamines (Si-OMeTPAs) enable more stable PSCs. We reported Si-OMeTPA based devices with a half-life of 6 K h, compared to 1 K h collected for the state-of-the-art PSCs using spirofluorene linked methoxy triphenylamines (spiro-OMeTADs) as HTMs. We demonstrated that such a clear improvement is correlated to the superior thermal stability of silolothiophene compared to the spirofluorene linked triphenylamine HTMs.

The use of organic–inorganic perovskites has rapidly led to research activities in the development of new materials for cost-effective and high-efficiency photovoltaic technologies. Since the first demonstration by Kojima and co-workers in 2009, several perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have been reported and certified with rapidly improving maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE). The recent 20% PCE barrier breaking proved that these materials can compete with long-established inorganic photovoltaics, such as silicon, cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide. In addition, more similar to organic photovoltaics, perovskites allow the preparation of solar cells from solution processing, which is particularly desired to deliver a low-cost technology.

Compared to such impressive progress in the PCE, the knowledge on device stability in working condition is rather limited. The PCE may drop quite rapidly due to degradation of different device components, such as the perovskite itself and TiO2 or organic semiconductors, which are most commonly used as electron and hole selective contacts, respectively. Water molecules from the atmosphere are one of the main sources of degradation of perovskite, which can be avoided by processing and testing the devices in inert gas or dry air. Leijtens, Pathak and co-workers demonstrated that TiO2 can also cause a drop in performance if devices are exposed to UV-light under oxygen-free conditions, such as when the active layer is sealed between two glasses. However, they showed that doping TiO2 with aluminium or simply filtering the UV component of the solar spectrum is sufficient to retard this degradation mechanism. More recently a number of studies have indicated that the hole transporting materials (HTMs) can play a key role in controlling the long-term stability of PSCs. In particular, Mei, Li, Habisreutinger and co-workers demonstrated that PSCs are more stable if the organic semiconductors are replaced by carbon nanotubes as HTMs. Furthermore, Liu and co-workers showed that employing dopant-free organic HTMs significantly improves the device stability compared to the commonly used chemical doping. Previous studies provided valuable indications on potential degradation mechanisms. Nevertheless it is still problematic to predict the lifetime of PSCs in working condition. There is an intrinsic complication, which stems from the fact that any small difference in the device architecture, preparation procedures and material composition strongly affects the stability of PSCs. In addition, stability tests are difficult to compare since they have often been performed at different temperatures, illumination conditions, such as with or without UV-light filtering, and atmospheric conditions, such as humid or dry air and inert gases. Finally, the device performance has been mostly monitored by regularly collecting current–voltage (JV) characteristics during ageing, as it was established in protocols used for silicon solar cells. However, the JV characteristics of PSCs may show a relatively large hysteretic behaviour, which makes it ambiguous to estimate the actual PCE. In freshly-made devices this problem can be minimized by slowing down the voltage sweep rate, but for aged devices Tress and co-workers recently showed that even if the hysteresis of the JV scan has almost vanished, the steady-state photocurrent and thus the actual PCE can be significantly lower.
In this work, we study the stability of PSCs using novel HTMs in working condition in inert gas and under UV-filtered sunlight. We propose a testing protocol to extract reliable and reproducible ageing data, which enable the prediction of the device lifetime. We show that a slow and long-lasting component of the degradation dynamics is correlated to the stability of the HTM and we demonstrate that new silolothiophene linked methoxy triphenylamines (Si-OMeTPAs) significantly enhance the lifetime of state-of-the-art PSCs prepared with spirofluorene linked methoxy triphenylamines (spiro-OMeTADs).

The high resolution scanning electron microscopy image of the cross-sectional view of PSCs prepared in this work is shown in Fig. 1. From the bottom we can identify the FTO glass with compact TiO2, mixed mesoporous TiO2 and perovskite crystals, a perovskite crystal capping layer, the HTM and the gold electrode. To study the performance degradation of PSCs in working condition, we monitored the steady-state maximum power output (MPO) over several days of testing. During the measurement, the devices were kept constantly under UV-filtered simulated sunlight and forward bias voltage. The applied voltage was automatically adjusted to continuously keep the devices at the maximum power point. In Fig. 2, we report the MPO decay of three identical devices (A, B and C) fabricated by a facile, solution-processed perovskite on mesoporous TiO2 and using chemically doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. The devices were prepared and tested under inert gas conditions following the procedure described in the Experimental section. The MPO traces of devices A, B and C in Fig. 2 show an early rapid decay that affects the MPO in the first testing hours and a second slower decay that becomes dominant at longer time exposures. The experimental data accurately fit a double exponential decay function, which allows extracting two half-life constants (see ESI). In the first few hours the MPO drops with a fast half-life of 5.3 h, as averaged on three devices reported in Fig. 2. Similar dynamics have been recently observed by Guarnera and co-workers, who demonstrated that a rapid degradation mechanism is activated by metal electrode migration through spiro-OMeTAD and contacting the perovskite layer. A direct contact between the metal and the perovskite results in detrimental electronic shunt pathways, which lower the MPO. Though this degradation mechanism is relatively rapid, it saturates in a few hours and thus only marginally impacts the long-term stability.

After a few hours of ageing the MPO goes into the second degradation regime which exhibits a slow half-life of 1100 hours, as averaged on three devices reported in Fig. 2. This large difference between the first fast and the second slow exponential decay suggests a new degradation mechanism that becomes dominant after a few hours of device functioning. Though the new degradation regime is significantly slower than the first, it nevertheless does not saturate and thus it may dramatically impact the long-term stability. This degradation could in principle be correlated to any of the device components, such as perovskite, TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD, or a complex combination of them. However, we prepared and tested devices under inert gas and UV-filtered light conditions, which should guarantee relatively stable TiO2 and perovskite over the testing time. Therefore, we postulated that the degradation of the HTM contributes to this slow and long lasting MPO decay and we compared different HTMs to demonstrate this theory.
We prepared new silolothiophene linked methoxy triphenylamine (Si-OMeTPA) derivatives using the synthetic protocol shown in Scheme 1. 4-Methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-(trimethylstannyl)phenyl)aniline (i) was prepared by n-BuLi followed by reaction with trimethyltin chloride. Dibromo-substituted compounds ii and iii were prepared by bromination with NBS in DMF. The Stille reaction of ii and iii with 2.5 equivalents of i in toluene produced two Si-OMeTPAs, PEH-1 and PEH-2. Additional details are given in the Experimental section.
In Fig. 3 we report the absorption spectra of PEH-1 and PEH-2 in dichloromethane. Both the Si-OMeTPA derivatives showed similar spectra with a broad absorption in the ultraviolet region and a strong absorption band in the visible region. The latter peak at around 450 nm with the PEH-2 trace was red-shifted compared to PEH-1. This shift suggests that the benzyl groups attached to sp3 silicon in PEH-2 more effectively stabilize the first molecular excited state compared to the alkyl chain functionalized silicon in PEH-1.
In Fig. 4 we report the cyclic voltammogram traces of PEH-1 and PEH-2 in dichloromethane. Both Si-OMeTPA derivatives show evidence of two oxidation peaks, which are rather similar since they correspond to one electron oxidation process for the same electron donating triphenylamine units. We converted the oxidation potentials (E0ox) to the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) by following the procedure previously described. We estimated the zero–zero transition (E0–0) from the threshold of the absorption spectra in dichloromethane (see Fig. 3) and used this value to calculate the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO). All optoelectronic properties are summarized in Table 1.

We prepared PSCs using the new molecules as HTMs with the usual doping composition as detailed in the Experimental section. In Fig. 5 we report the JV characteristics of PSCs prepared with Si-OMeTPA derivatives and spiro-OMeTAD. In Table 2, we summarize the device performance parameters, as extracted from the JV curves in Fig. 3, and the light intensity measured right before each JV scan. We note that PEH-2 allowed collecting nearly identical short circuit current (Jsc) to spiro-OMeTAD, while the Jsc for the PEH-1 device was over 2.5 mA cm−2 lower. Both the Si-OMeTPA devices showed a similar open circuit voltage (Voc), which was about 50 mV lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. This can be rationalized considering that the EHOMO we measured for both Si-OMeTPA derivatives were about 50 meV higher than the value reported for spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV). From the fitting of the JV curves in Fig. 2 we extracted the device series resistance (Rs). The Rs values reported in Table 1 showed that the Si-OMeTPA devices have higher Rs than spiro-OMeTAD, which contributes to the lower fill factor (FF). The calculated PCEs are 15.2, 13.5 and 11.7% for spiro-OMeTAD, PEH-2 and PEH-1 respectively.

We note that the JV characteristics of PSCs may show hysteretic behaviour, which makes it ambiguous to estimate the actual PCE. To show the impact of the hysteresis on our device performances, we reported in Fig. 6 the JV traces of PSCs collected at a scanning rate of 0.01 V s−1 from forward bias (FB) to short circuit (SC) and the other way around. All the devices have been prepared and tested at the same time, using identical preparation conditions. In Table 3, we summarized the device performance parameters as extracted from both directions of the JV curves reported in Fig. 6. It is interesting to note that PEH-1 showed the lowest Jsc and the highest hysteresis, while PEH-2 and spiro-OMeTAD showed similar hysteretic behaviour.

In Fig. 7, we report the MPO decay of PSCs prepared in a single experiment, using chemically doped PEH-2 and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs. As to data reported in Fig. 2, devices were prepared and aged under inert gas conditions and UV-filtered light, following the preparation procedure reported in the Experimental section. We note that there is no trace of PEH-1 since devices employing PEH-1 were extremely unstable, and their MPO traces dropped to almost zero within a few hours of testing (see ESI). PEH-1 is an aliphatic substituted Si-compound which is well known to undergo a beta-hydrogen elimination forming an intermediate Si–H complex which will further decompose. The enhanced stability of PEH-2 is due to the prevention of beta elimination caused by replacing an alkyl by an aryl moiety. As we have already observed for a number of devices prepared in different experiments (see Fig. 2), the MPO traces of PEH-2 and spiro-OMeTAD devices reported in Fig. 7 showed a double exponential decay trend within the first 200 hours of testing. In particular, they have a very similar early time decay, which can be well modelled using the same fast half-life (5.3 h) calculated by averaging the MPO decay of three different spiro-OMeTAD devices reported in Fig. 2. According to the result of Guarnera and co-workers, we assigned this decay to the formation of shunting pathways caused by metal electrode migration within the HTM and contacting the perovskite layer. The fact that both devices exhibit the same fast half-life constant suggests that this degradation mechanism is active regardless of the particular HTM used. However, it saturates within a few hours and thus it will impact the long-term stability only marginally. More significantly, the second and longer lasting decay regime shows that the PEH-2 device degrades with a half-life 6 times larger than that of spiro-OMeTAD. In Fig. 7, we also report the MPO collected after 850 h, which decay to 0.65 and 0.45 of the initial value for PEH-2 and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. We note that in the time window between 200 and 850 h the devices were kept under light and inert gas conditions, but not always under applied bias voltage. Nevertheless, the MPO after 850 h is in good agreement with the trend we found in the first 200 h of testing, confirming that PEH-2 is substantially more stable than the spiro-OMeTAD device. We highlight that data reported in Fig. 7 were collected from devices prepared in a single experiment, following the same procedures and using the same chemical doping composition for both the HTMs. Therefore, except for the HTM, there are no differences in the device architecture, preparation procedures and material composition that can justify such a large difference in long-term stability. In addition, both the HTMs have the same triphenylamine donor units, which are linked by silolothiophene or spirofluorene groups in PEH-2 and spiro-OMeTAD respectively. This apparently minor difference dramatically impacted the device lifetime, demonstrating that the design of the HTM is crucial to prepare stable PSCs. A recent study by Malinauskas and co-workers showed that the thermal stability of spiro-OMeTAD is the main source of long-term performance degradation in solid-state solar cells. In particular they demonstrated that during the device operation a thermal transition from an amorphous to a crystalline phase causes morphological changes within the spiro-OMeTAD film that may reduce the mechanical contact of the hole transporting layer with other device components, thus retarding the charge collection and the overall device performances. We found from thermal gravimetric analysis that PEH-2 has superior thermal stability than spiro-OMeTAD (see ESI). In particular we found from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that the glass transition temperature of PEH-2 is over 100 °C higher than spiro-OMeTAD. A higher glass transition temperature retards the formation of crystalline domains within the hole transporter layer during device ageing, which results in more stable device performances in working condition. However, for PEH-1, the DSC measurement revealed an endothermic transition around 120 °C. This suggests the presence of a crystalline phase at room temperature when the molecule is processed from solution, which is consistent with the rapid degradation observed in the PEH-1 devices.

In this work, we synthesized novel HTMs and studied their stability in PSCs in working condition. Previous studies showed that the stability of PSCs is strongly affected by the device preparation and ageing conditions. Nevertheless, we pointed out that the testing protocol may originate additional inconsistencies. To get more reproducible ageing data, we proposed to monitor the device steady-state maximum power output in working condition. Making use of this method, we estimated that the state-of-the-art PSCs prepared with mesoporous TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD have a half-life of about 1 K h. To improve the device lifetime we explored new HTMs and found that in particular silolothiophene linked triphenylamines enable the preparation of PSCs with a half-life of about 6 K h. We demonstrated that such a clear improvement is correlated to the superior thermal stability of silolothiophene compared to the spirofluorene linked triphenylamine HTMs. This result proved that the HTMs have a strong impact on the long-term stability of PSCs and we expect that further advances, in both stability and power conversion efficiency of PSCs, will come by exploring new silolothiophene derivatives.


All the synthetic procedures and device fabrication were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted.



1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker spectrometer (400 MHz) and Bruker AvanceIII-400 (400 MHz), respectively, and are reported in ppm using CDCl3-d as an internal standard. Absorption spectral measurements were recorded using a JASCO V630 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Thermal analysis was conducted using a Sinco TGA N-1000 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry was performed using an Autolab Eco Chemie cyclic voltammeter in dichloromethane solvent. The experimental setup consisted of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a platinum reference electrode. Oxygen was removed by bubbling with pure nitrogen gas for 5 min at room temperature. The system was initially calibrated with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. The redox potential of HTMs is measured in CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M (n-C4H9)4N-PF6 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.


5,5′-Bis[4-trimethylstannyl-N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline]-3,3′-dihexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (PEH-1): 4-bromo-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline (0.55 g, 1.04 mmol) in dry THF under a nitrogen atmosphere was added drop-wise to n-BuLi (0.68 ml, 2.5 M in hexane) at −78 °C. After 30 min of stirring at −78 °C, 1.71 ml of trimethyltin chloride (1.0 M in THF solution) was added slowly to the reaction solution at −78 °C. The temperature of the solution was warmed to room temperature and the reaction was stirred overnight. Then, the reaction was quenched with brine. The solution was extracted with diethylether, dried with MgSO4. Compound i was obtained without any purification. Compounds i and ii (0.33 g, 0.5 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (0.077 g, 0.067 mmol), and anhydrous toluene (50 ml) were added to a 125 ml flame-dried Schlenk flask with a condenser under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 1 day, then cooled to room temperature. The organic layer was separated and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was removed in vacuum overnight. The obtained orange product was purified by column chromatography. Yield: 60%.

5,5′-Bis[4-trimethylstannyl-N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline]-3,3′-diphenylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (PEH-2) was synthesized following a procedure similar to that we used for PEH-1, except that iii (0.3 g, 0.59 mmol) was used in place of ii.

The devices were fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. The substrates were cleaned sequentially with Hellmanex in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, then washed with acetone and isopropanol, and finally cleaned with oxygen plasma for 5 min. A 30 nm TiO2 compact layer was deposited on FTO via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol. After spraying, the substrates were left at 450 °C for 45 min, then they were left to cool down to room temperature. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating for 20 s at 4000 rpm with a ramp of 2000 rpm s−1, using 30 nm particle paste (Dyesol) diluted in ethanol to achieve a 150 nm thick layer. After the spin coating, the substrate was immediately dried at 100 °C for 10 min and then sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min, under a flow of dry air.

Upon cooling to room temperature, the perovskite layer was deposited in a nitrogen-filled glovebox by spin coating the perovskite precursor solution. The latter was prepared by dissolving a stoichiometric amount (1:1 molar ratio) of lead iodide and methyl ammonium iodide in dimethylsulfoxide at a concentration of 1.1 M of each component. The spin coating program includes two steps, first at 1000 rpm for 10 s with a ramp of 200 rpm s−1, then at 6000 rpm for 30 s with a ramp of 2000 rpm s−1. 10 s before the end of the spin-coating program, chlorobenzene was gently dropped on the spinning substrate for 2 s using an automatic dispenser. The substrate was then heated at 90 °C for 1 h on a hot plate in the nitrogen-filled glovebox.
The HTMs were subsequently deposited on the top of the perovskite layer by spin coating from a solution at 4000 rpm for 20 s with a ramp of 2000 rpm s−1. The HTM solutions were prepared by dissolving the compounds (PEH-1, PEH-2 or spiro-OMeTAD) in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 60 mM, with the addition of 50 mol% bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Aldrich) from a 1.8 M stock solution in acetonitrile, 330 mol% tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich) and 2 mol% Tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) Tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (Dyesol) from a 0.25 M stock solution in acetonitrile.
Finally, 80 nm of gold was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum, using a shadow mask to pattern the electrodes.

A ZEISS Merlin HR-SEM was used to characterize the morphology of the device cross-section. Current–voltage characteristics were measured in air under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight using a potentiostat (Keithley). The light intensity was measured for calibration using an NREL certified KG5 filtered Si reference diode. The solar cells were masked with a metal aperture of 0.16 cm2 to define the active area. The current–voltage curves were recorded at a scanning rate of 0.01 V s−1.

Stability was measured by placing devices in a box under a 20 ml min−1 argon flow. During the test the devices were constantly kept at the maximum power point under 100 mW cm−2 light intensity using white LED, with no light emission at wavelengths below 400 nm. The temperature of the testing box stabilized at 45 °C after a few minutes under light. To keep the device constantly at the maximum power output we used a maximum power point tracking algorithm similar to what was recently reported by Ahmed and co-workers.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted on a DSC8000 calorimeter from PerkinElmer using 2–4 mg of sample powder placed in an aluminium pan with a tight-fitting lid. The scans were taken from 30 °C to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. Thermal gravimetric analysis was conducted using a Scinco TGA N-1000 under a nitrogen atmosphere.
