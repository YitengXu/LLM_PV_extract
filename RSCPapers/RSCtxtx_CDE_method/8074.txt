All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of conjugated polymers for both electron donors and acceptors, are promising photovoltaic candidates owing to their superior mechanical properties and long-term stability in addition to tunable light absorption and energy levels of the photoactive materials. One of the critical limitations to the device performance of all-PSCs is the non-ideal bulk-heterojunction morphology. Herein, we report the manipulation of active layer morphology for producing efficient all-PSCs based on a set of polymer donors (J52, J52-F, and J52-FS) with identical conjugated main chains but different side-chain atomic substituents. When blended with a state-of-the-art polymer acceptor NOE10, J52 provided a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 8.7%, whereas J52-FS afforded a low PCE of 3.9%. The nano-spectroscopic imaging of the blend films revealed that the domain size in them is closely related to the device efficiency, and the highest PCE of the J52:NOE10 blend was contributed by its smallest domain size. The formation of different active layer morphologies was further explained by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter. In addition, benefiting from the high miscibility of donors and acceptors, the J52:NOE10 devices achieved higher storage stability and thermal stability. These findings will aid in morphology optimization for high-performance all-PSCs.

The performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly improved over the past few years. Major efforts have been devoted to developing new photovoltaic materials and device engineering with an aim of collecting more incident photons from solar irradiation, forming appropriate energy level alignment at the heterojunction interface, improving the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of donor:acceptor blend films, etc. In particular, non-fullerene small molecular acceptors have led to breakthroughs in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 18%, thereby bringing PSCs into a new era. Meanwhile, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) consisting of conjugated polymers for both donors and acceptors have emerged as a promising renewable energy technology for applications in flexible and wearable photovoltaics owing to their unique advantages, including complementary light absorption, chemical tunability of the photoactive materials, and excellent mechanical properties. Benefiting from the extensive efforts on all-PSCs in the past decade, especially the development of new polymer acceptors, the PCEs of state-of-the-art all-PSCs have exceeded 16%. However, the device performance of all-PSCs still lags behind that of small molecular acceptor-based PSCs. One of the critical limitations to the inferior device performance of all-PSCs is the non-ideal BHJ morphology. In most cases, it is highly challenging to form a few tens of nanometer-sized domains for polymer:polymer blends because of the significantly reduced entropic contribution by two macromolecular species that demote their mixing. In addition, the importance of desired BHJ morphology for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport is greatly amplified in all-PSCs, because the electron mobility of the polymer acceptors is generally lower than that of the small molecular acceptors. Therefore, morphology optimization is crucial to improve the device performance of all-PSCs.

The active layer morphology of all-PSCs is generally influenced by film-forming methods and molecular structures. For a specific polymer:polymer blend, the final morphology can be optimized by varying the processing conditions including the selection of solvent, additive, solution temperature during processing,etc. For example, the groups of Liu and Huang reported that the use of volatile solvents during active layer processing helps in obtaining optimized multilength scale morphology and high-performance all-PSCs. Besides, molecular engineering, including polymer weight control, side-chain functionalization, conjugated backbone design,etc., has been applied to optimize the polymer crystallinity and blend morphology of all-PSCs. For example, Kim's group reported that the higher molecular weight of donor polymers can promote a preferential “face-on” orientation in the blended film, thus leading to a higher hole mobility and higher PCE of all-PSCs. Bao et al. demonstrated the decrease of the phase-separated domain size in all-polymer blends by introducing bulky side chains to donor polymers. Nevertheless, the structure–morphology–device performance relationships finalized from these specific donor:acceptor combinations are usually not applicable to other systems, which are drastically different from small molecular acceptor-based PSCs. In other words, it is still difficult to predict and control the BHJ morphology of all-PSCs for a new donor:acceptor combination. Therefore, new strategies toward morphology optimization of polymer:polymer blends are very much in demand to improve the device performance of all-PSCs.
Herein, we demonstrate the regulation of phase separation morphology and performance enhancement of all-PSCs by using a set of structurally relevant donor polymers (J52, J52-F, and J52-FS) (Fig. 1a) and a state-of-the-art acceptor polymer NOE10 (Fig. 1b). The three donor polymers based on difluorobenzotriazole have the same conjugated backbones and alkyl chains but different side-chain atomic substituents. They possess very similar optical properties and slightly different energy levels, which afforded excellent device performance when paired with small molecular non-fullerene acceptors as reported in a previous study. The acceptor polymer, NOE10, is an analog of N2200 with 10% of the alkyl chains on naphthalene diimide (NDI) units being replaced by linear oligoethylene oxide side-chains. Interestingly, distinctly different effects of side-chain atomic substituents of the donor polymers on the device performance of all-PSCs were observed. A high PCE of 8.7% and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaching 80% have been achieved using J52-based all-PSCs, whereas a slightly lower PCE of 8.3% and an extremely poor PCE of 3.9% were afforded by J52-F and J52-FS, respectively. We further revealed that the device performance correlates well with the morphology parameters by nanoscale tapping AFM-IR+ microscopy. The formation of the smallest phase-separated domains explained why J52 provided the highest PCE. In contrast, the J52-FS:NOE10 blend exhibited the largest domains, accounting for the lowest PCE. The formation of these morphologies in different scales was further explained by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter, which is indicative of the miscibility between the polymer donor and acceptor. Overall, these findings will aid in precise morphology optimization for high-performance all-PSCs in the future.

The three donor polymers (J52, J52-F, and J52-FS) and the acceptor polymer NOE10 were synthesized by following the previously reported procedures. J52, J52-F, and J52-FS have very similar number-average molecular weights (Mn) and molar-mass dispersity (ĐM), which are 17 kDa/2.7, 25 kDa/1.9 and 20 kDa/2.6, respectively, estimated by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in o-DCB at 140 °C. Similar molecular weights are beneficial to a fair comparison of the morphology and device performance of the donor polymers. The thermal stability of the polymers was characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), all the polymers are very stable with decomposition temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss up to ≈350 °C.


Fig. 1d shows the normalized absorption spectra of the neat polymer films. The three donor polymers show similar absorption profiles with the main absorption band in the wavelength range of 300–650 nm and almost the same optical bandgap of ≈1.92 eV, suggesting that the introduction of the fluorine and sulfur atoms as side-chain substituents has negligible influence on the optical properties of the donor polymers. The acceptor polymer NOE10 exhibits two absorption bands in the wavelength ranges of 300–450 and 500–850 nm, respectively, which are complementary to the absorption of the donor polymers and can thus maximize the light-harvesting ability of the blends. The energy levels of the three donor polymers and NOE10 are depicted in Fig. 1e. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of J52, J52-F, and J52-FS are −5.13, −5.29, and −5.32 eV, and their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are −3.22, −3.38, and −3.39 eV, respectively. The slightly down-shifted energy levels of J52-F and J52-FS compared to that of J52 can be related to the large electron negativity of the fluorine atom and the presence of an empty 3d-orbital of the sulfur atom. The HOMO/LUMO levels of NOE10 were estimated to be −5.81/−3.91 eV. As a result, each combination of the donor polymer and NOE10 has sufficient energy offsets (>0.3 eV) for efficient exciton dissociation in the donor:acceptor interfaces. In addition, the slightly deeper-lying HOMO of J52-F and J52-FS will contribute to higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) for the resulting all-PSCs.
To understand the impact of side-chain atomic substituents on photovoltaic properties, all-PSCs in a device of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-(2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-Br)/Ag were fabricated. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The key photovoltaic metrics such as Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCEs are listed in Table 1. The all-PSCs based on J52:NOE10 demonstrated a high PCE of 8.7% with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 15.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.73. The optimized all-PSCs based on J52-F:NOE10 showed a slightly lower PCE of 8.3% along with a higher Voc of 0.90 V, a slightly lower FF of 0.71, but a much lower Jsc of 12.9 mA cm−2. Surprisingly, the all-PSCs of J52-FS:NOE10 afforded a significantly inferior PCE of 3.9% along with the lowest Jsc of 7.9 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.53, although they offered the highest Voc of 0.93 V among the three kinds of devices. The Voc values of the all-PSCs agree well with the difference in energy levels of the three donor polymers. Moreover, the side-chain atomic substituents brought in more substantial influence on the Jsc and FF of the all-PSCs.

The difference in Jsc of the all-PSCs has been confirmed by the EQE spectra. All the Jsc values integrated from the EQE spectra to the AM1.5G solar spectrum match well with those obtained from the J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. 2b, the three kinds of all-PSCs showed similar profiles of the EQE spectra in the waveband range of 300–850 nm, which are consistent with the absorption spectra of the blend films and corroborated the contributions from both the donor polymers and the acceptor polymer to the photocurrents of the solar cells. However, the EQE spectra of the three kinds of all-PSCs differ significantly in height. The highest EQE of 78% was realized by the J52:NOE10 device, which is followed by a lower EQE maximum of 67% by J52-F:NOE10, and a further decreased EQE maximum of 46% by J52-FS:NOE10. Since the difference in energy levels among the three donor polymers is relatively small, the large difference in Jsc and FF of the corresponding all-PSCs should be mainly ascribed to their morphological features rather than their energetics, which will be discussed in more detail later.
The charge generation characteristics of the all-PSCs were investigated by comparing the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the neat polymer films and blended films under the same excitation wavelength. The higher PL quenching efficiency means more efficient photon-induced charge transfer at the donor–acceptor interface and improved miscibility between the donor polymers and the acceptor polymer NOE10, which is favourable to achieve higher Jsc values in the all-PSCs. The neat polymer films (J52, J52-F, J52-FS, and NOE10) and their corresponding blended films were excited at 520 nm to study the electron transfer from the excited donor polymer to the acceptor polymer, and at 720 nm to study the hole transfer from the excited acceptor polymer to the donor polymer. As shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI), the J52:NOE10 and J52-F:NOE10 blends showed the highest donor/acceptor quenching efficiencies of 96/98%. The high PL quenching efficiency suggests efficient charge transfer in the blended films, which agrees well with the highest Jsc values of the J52-F:NOE10 cell. In comparison, the PL quenching efficiencies of J52-FS:NOE10 are significantly lower, which are 92% and 85% for donor and acceptor, respectively. Considering that the HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO offsets between the donor and acceptor polymers of all three blends are sufficient for efficient exciton dissociation, the different PL quenching efficiencies should be mainly caused by the difference in morphology.
The charge transport characteristics of the all-PSCs were investigated in hole-only and electron-only devices. The hole and electron mobilities were acquired by fitting the J–V curves of the single-carrier devices to a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model. The results are presented in Table 1 and Fig. S3 (ESI). The hole and electron mobilities were estimated to be 7.0 × 10−3 and 4.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J52:NOE10, 4.4 × 10−3 and 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J52-F:NOE10, and 2.0 × 10−3 and 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J52-FS:NOE10, respectively. The higher hole and electron mobilities are beneficial to suppressing bimolecular charge recombination, mitigating space charge accumulation, and promoting charge extraction, which thereby account for the higher Jsc and FF of the all-PSCs. Compared to J52:NOE10, the approximate 2-fold and 4-fold decrease of the hole and electron mobilities of J52-F:NOE10 and J52-FS:NOE10 could be caused by the poorer BHJ morphology.
The Jsc as a function of the intensity of incident light (Plight) was measured to investigate the bimolecular charge recombination in the all-PSCs. In principle, the Jsc shows a power-law dependence on the Plight (Jsc ∝ Pαlight), where the power-law component (α) will be unity in the case of no bimolecular recombination loss. The Jsc ∝ Plight characteristics of the devices in the light intensity range of 1–100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 2c. The α values from the fitted line are 0.997, 0.985, and 0.963 for the all-PSCs based on J52, J52-F, and J52-FS, respectively, indicating the negligible bimolecular recombination in these devices. The relationship between the Voc and Plight can be expressed as: Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight) (Fig. 2d), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively. The bimolecular recombination is dominant when the slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) is kT/q, and additional monomolecular recombination and/or trap-assisted recombination are involved for 2kT/q. The J52:NOE10, J52-F:NOE10, and J52-FS:NOE10 devices exhibited a slope of 1.58, 1.81, and 1.95 kT/q, respectively, indicating that monomolecular recombination and/or trap-assisted recombination increase in the all-PSCs with a sequence of J52 < J52-F < J52-FS. These results are also consistent with the descending Jsc and FF of the all-PSCs (J52 > J52-F > J52-FS).
The crystalline order of the polymers in both pure films and blends was characterized by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The two-dimensional scattering patterns and line-cut profiles of pure polymers and blend films are shown in Fig. 3. The lattice parameters are summarized in Table S3 (ESI). As shown in Fig. 3a and b and Table S3 (ESI), the three donor polymers show similar diffraction patterns, which exhibited clear (100) peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction at ≈0.28 Å−1, and (010) peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at ≈1.76 Å−1, indicating that the polymers predominantly adopt “face-on” orientation to the substrate. The acceptor polymer NOE10 exhibited multiple diffraction peaks in the OOP direction and two diffraction peaks (100, and 200) in the IP direction, confirming its high crystallinity. The face-on orientation of the donor polymers and the high crystallinity of the acceptor polymer are desirable for efficient charge transport in all-PSCs. The GIWAXS results of the blend films demonstrate microstructural features from both the polymer donor and acceptor. The π–π stacking distances of the blended films in the out-of-plane direction are 3.52, 3.59, and 3.59 Å for J52:NOE10, J52-F:NOE10, and J52-FS:NOE10, respectively. The (010) crystal coherence length (CCL) calculated using the Scherrer equation is 17.94, 13.96, and 12.56 Å for the three blends, respectively. The smaller π–π stacking distances and longer coherence length will facilitate the charge transport across the active layer of the all-PSCs, which are consistent with the higher Jsc and FF of the devices. Particularly, the smallest π–π stacking distance and the longest CCL should account for the highest device performance of the solar cells based on the J52:NOE10 blend.
The surface and bulk morphologies of the blended films were probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3c–e). As shown in the AFM height images, the J52:NOE10 film exhibited a smoother surface with a smaller root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.80 nm compared to the J52-F:NOE10 (RMS = 2.02 nm) and J52-FS:NOE10 (RMS = 2.49 nm) films, which indicates the better miscibility between J52 and NOE10. In the AFM phase images, the J52:NOE10 film shows more defined network structures with suitable phase separation compared to the other two blended films. Particularly, the J52-FS:NOE10 film shows an excessive phase-separated morphology with the emergence of many granular aggregates, which is consistent with the lower hole/electron mobilities and device parameters (Jsc, FF, and EQE) observed for the corresponding devices. The difference in morphology of the three blended films can be further confirmed by the TEM images. As shown in Fig. 3e, J52-FS:NOE10 shows a clear phase-separated morphology with wide polymer fibers, whereas J52:NOE10 shows a more defined bicontinuous interpenetrating network structure with the formation of narrow fibers. These differences in morphology explained the device parameters and electrical characteristics of the all-PSCs discussed above, which confirmed the effect of side-chain atomic substituents on the BHJ morphology of the all-PSCs.
Tapping AFM-IR+ was used to obtain high-resolution optical images and spectroscopic information for mapping out the nanofiber morphology of the blended films. Built on AFM, tapping AFM-IR+ can direct imaging and chemical identification with a spatial resolution of ∼10 nm, significantly enhancing the ability to probe local chemical composites. By imaging at the characteristic Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) wavenumber corresponding to the absorption peaks of the donor and acceptor materials, tapping AFM-IR+ images showed better resolution to spatially map the nanoscale patterns of specific chemical components in the blended films. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI), we selected the absorption peak at 1310 cm−1 of J52, at 1385 cm−1 of J52-F and J52-FS, and the peak at 1710 cm−1 of NOE10 in their FT-IR spectra for AFM-IR+ imaging. As shown in Fig. 4, the crystalline polymer fibers with clear grain boundaries were formed in all the three blended films. Among the three blends, the nanofibers in the J52:NOE10 blend were better separated with less agglomerated bundles, while the J52-FS:NOE10 blend exhibited over-aggregated regions. Considering that charge separation mainly occurs at the D–A interface, the J52:NOE10 film with a uniform fiber network will be more conducive to generate current. Combining the AFM and TEM images, it is clear that the formation of the smallest domains in J52:NOE10 but larger domains in the J52-FS:NOE10 film can be attributed to the discrepant miscibility of the donor polymers and NOE10. These results suggested that adjusting the side-chain atomic substituents is an effective strategy to modulate the phase separation behavior of all-polymer blends.
To provide deep insights into the phase-separated morphology of the all-polymer blends, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed to calculate the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) by the melting-point depression method. Pristine NOE10 shows a melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of 7.25 J g−1 and a melting point (Tm) of 338.75 °C, indicating its semi-crystalline nature. The donor polymers J52, J52-F, and J52-FS do not show any phase transition on neither cooling nor heating, suggesting the low crystallinity of these polymers. The melting temperature and melting enthalpy of the blends of J52:NOE10, J52-F:NOE10, and J52-FS:NOE10 were determined by DSC measurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. The melting and crystallization transitions of NOE10 were greatly depressed upon blending with J52 and J52-F, suggesting the good miscibility of the donor:NOE10 blends. In contrast, both the melting and crystallization transitions of the J52-FS:NOE10 blend were maintained with a small change of phase transition temperature. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) was further calculated by the Nishi–Wang equation:
The subscript 1 is identified with the amorphous polymers (J52, J52-F, and J52-FS), and 2 the semi-crystalline polymer NOE10. T0m is the melting point of NOE10, Tm is the melting point of the blends, ϕ is the volume fraction, V is the molar volume of the repeat unit, ΔHf is the heat of fusion of the pure semi-crystalline polymer NOE10, χ is the Flory–Huggins segmental interaction parameter, and R is the ideal gas constant. The calculated interaction parameter (χ) is 1.02 for the J52:NOE10 blend, 1.05 for the J52-F:NOE10 blend, and 1.91 for the J52-FS:NOE10 blend. Generally, a higher χ value indicates a lower polymer miscibility and larger phase separation. Thus, the miscibility of the donor and acceptor polymers in these blends follows the trend of J52:NOE10 > J52-F:NOE10 > J52-FS:NOE10, which is in accordance with the blend film morphology. Furthermore, the miscibility correlates well with the Jsc and FF of the corresponding all-PSCs (Fig. 5b).
The miscibility between the donor polymers and NOE10 was further investigated by contact angle measurements (Fig. S5, ESI). The surface energies of the donor polymers decreased with the introduction of F and S atoms (Table S6, ESI), which would be the molecular origin of the different miscibility among the various donor:acceptor blends. As a result, the difference in solubility parameter (δ) between the donor and the acceptor increased with the introduction of F and S atoms. We also calculated the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter from the equation  (Table S6, ESI), which afforded the same trend as that obtained from the DSC method. Based on these results, we suppose that the complex morphology of polymer:polymer blends can be affected by side-chain atomic substituents. Furthermore, the performance of the all-PSCs can be improved via optimizing the multilength scale morphology through side-chain engineering.
As reported in a previous study that a better miscibility between the polymer donor and acceptor can improve the morphological stability, the storage and thermal stability of the all-PSCs were explored. For the storage stability test, the devices were stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox at room temperature under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 5c, the J52:NOE10 device exhibited good stability with about 95% of its initial PCE being retained after 650 hours of storage. However, only 82% and 66% of the initial PCEs can be retained for the J52-F:NOE10 and J52-FS:NOE10 devices, respectively. Furthermore, the thermal stability of the J52:NOE10, J52-F:NOE10, and J52-FS:NOE10 devices was compared under continuous 65 °C thermal aging (Fig. 5d). After constant heating for 300 hours, the efficiency of the J52:NOE10 device decreased gradually from 8.7% to 6.1%, which represents 30% loss in efficiency. In contrast, the J52-F:NOE10 and J52-FS:NOE10 devices showed accelerated degradation with 47% and 60% efficiency losses, respectively, after heating at 65°C for 300hours. Overall, the all-PSCs based on J52 showed excellent storage lifetime and thermal stability, which is mainly due to their uniformly distributed blend morphology.

In summary, we emphasized the importance of side-chain atomic substituents of donor polymers for producing highly efficient all-PSCs based on a set of structurally related donor polymers J52, J52-F, and J52-FS. Interestingly, the minor difference in the structures of the donor polymers has led to a huge difference in the bulk-heterojunction morphology and the device performance of the all-PSCs with the polymer acceptor NOE10. Although the packing orientation and the distance of the three donor polymers are similar, the phase separation behaviour of the blends differs significantly as revealed by the AFM, TEM, and tapping AFM-IR+ measurements. Particularly, a more defined network structure with a suitable phase separation morphology has been realized by the J52:NOE10 blend, which thereby provided the highest PCE of 8.7% in all-PSCs. In contrast, the J52-FS:NOE10 blend showed an excessive phase-separated morphology, leading to the lowest PCE of 3.9%. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter is used for further explaining the phase separation behaviour of the blends. Benefiting from the high miscibility of donors and acceptors, the J52:NOE10 device exhibited a higher storage lifetime and thermal stability. These results indicate that the performance of all-PSCs can be improved via optimizing the phase separation morphology through side-chain engineering. These findings will aid in morphology optimization for high-performance all-PSCs.
