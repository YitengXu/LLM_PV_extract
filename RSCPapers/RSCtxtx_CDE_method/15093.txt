Solution processed interfacial layers are commonly employed in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) for better charge collection. PDIN interfacial layers were prepared by employing a static or dynamic spin coating method from PDIN methanol solution, and defined as the S-PDIN or D-PDIN layer. The OSCs with a S-PDIN layer exhibit 13.88% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with a virtual high short circuit density (JSC) of 26.45 mA cm−2 and relatively low fill factor (FF) of 58.94% during the current density versus voltage (J–V) measurement without a shadow mask. 12.56% PCE is achieved for OSCs with a D-PDIN layer, along with a JSC of 18.85 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.88%. Over 77% FFs are obtained for OSCs with a S-PDIN or D-PDIN layer during J–V measurement with a shadow mask, and both OSCs exhibit a very similar JSC and PCE. The virtual high JSCs and relatively low FF of OSCs with a S-PDIN layer may be due to the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS during preparation of the PDIN layer by the SSC method, which can be further confirmed from the OSCs with a methanol treated PEDOT:PSS layer. This work indicates that a well-balanced JSC and FF should be an important evaluating indicator for efficient OSCs, and an appropriate shadow mask is necessary to measure the J–V curves of OSCs with a solution processed interfacial layer.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown great application prospects as new energy sources due to their low cost, light weight, low temperature printing fabrication and potential in flexible devices. With the recent advances in materials chemistry and device engineering, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 15% for traditional single OSCs, 14% for ternary OSCs and 17% for tandem OSCs have been achieved, which brightens the practical applications of OSCs. Interfacial engineering plays a critical role in improving the performance of OSCs by incorporating an interfacial layer between the active layers and electrodes. PEDOT:PSS is widely used as an anode interfacial layer to improve hole injection in most optoelectronic devices. Several methods have been reported to significantly enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, including the addition of an organic compound into the PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution and the treatment of PEDOT:PSS films with a polar organic compound. However, a highly conductive PEDOT:PSS layer may induce a virtual high short circuit current density (JSC), a relatively low fill factor (FF) and a constant open-circuit voltage (VOC) of OSCs. PEDOT:PSS serving as a widely spread conductive network can collect the photogenerated charge outside the active area. Alcohol-soluble organic materials, such as PFN, PDIN,etc. are considered as promising candidates for cathode interfacial layers for obtaining highly efficient OSCs, which was due to their solution processability from environmentally friendly solvents, tunable functions through facile modification of molecular structures and excellent electronic properties. Solution processed PDIN interfacial layers with methanol as the solvent have been considered as a mature technology applied in the fabrication of OSCs. Methanol solvent may have some negative effects on the pre-prepared layers on the substrates, especially on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS layers, which may result in virtual high performance of OSCs.

In this work, the performance of OSCs with solution processed PDIN interfacial layers was investigated, in which the solution processed interfacial layers were fabricated by a spin coating method with different processes. The chemical structures of the used materials and the schematic diagram of the device structure are shown in Fig. 1a, and the absorption spectra of neat J71 and IT-2Cl films as well as the blend films were measured and are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). Here, two spin coating methods defined as static spin coating (SSC) and dynamic spin coating (DSC) were used to prepare the interfacial layer. Fig. 1b shows the schematic diagram of SSC by dropping the solution onto the substrate and then starting the spin coater to reach 5000 round per minute (RPM). Fig. 1c describes the schematic diagram of DSC by keeping the spin coater at 5000 rpm and then dropping the solution onto the substrates. The retention time of the solution on the substrates is different for the two preparation methods. In the SSC method, the solution has an additional 5 seconds retention time on the substrate before spin-coater rotation. The solution processed PDIN interfacial layers by the SSC method and treated PEDOT:PSS may influence the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layers, which induces a virtual high JSC and PCE of OSCs. An appropriate shadow mask is needed for the current density versus voltage (J–V) curve measurement of OSCs with the solution processed interfacial layer, which avoids collecting photogenerated charge outside the active area.

The OSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J71:IT-2Cl/PDIN/Al, the only difference is the PDIN interfacial layer prepared by the SSC or DSC method. To better discuss the effect of the PDIN fabrication method on the performance of OSCs, PDIN layers prepared by the SSC or DSC method are marked by S-PDIN or D-PDIN, respectively. The J–V curves of the OSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 without a shadow mask, as shown in Fig. 2a. The key parameters of all OSCs measured without or with the shadow mask are summarized in Table 1. It is apparent that 13.88% PCE is achieved for the OSCs with the S-PDIN layer along with a rather high JSC of 26.45 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.89 V and a rather low FF of 58.94%. The rather low FF indicates a serious charge loss in the OSCs. It is well known that the rather high JSC could be hardly obtained under a serious charge loss condition. For the OSCs with the D-PDIN layer, 12.56% PCE is obtained with a relatively low JSC of 18.85 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.89 V and a relatively high FF of 74.88%. The relatively high FF indicates the efficient charge transport and collection, which should be beneficial to achieve a relatively high JSC. The apparent contradiction between JSC and FFs can be observed from the OSCs with the S-PDIN or D-PDIN layer. The J–V curves of all OSCs were measured with a shadow mask under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. 2b. It is apparent that the J–V curves practically overlap for the OSCs with the S-PDIN or D-PDIN layer, exhibiting the very similar photovoltaic parameters. The PCE of OSCs with D-PDIN layers is slightly larger than that of OSCs with the S-PDIN layer, which may be induced by the enhanced thickness of the PDIN layer prepared by the SSC method. The thicknesses of the S-PDIN and D-PDIN layers were measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 stylus profiler, and are about 12 and 8 nm, respectively. The OSCs with S-PDIN layers exhibit significantly different JSC and FFs under the same measurement conditions without or with the shadow mask, which may result from the additional photogenerated charge collection outside the active area due to the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:PSS layers may be treated by methanol during the preparation of the PDIN layer by the SSC method because there is enough retention time for methanol on the active layers. Chu et al. reported that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films can be enhanced by methanol treatment. The OSCs with D-PDIN layers exhibit similar photovoltaic parameters under the same measurement conditions without or with the shadow mask, suggesting that the conductivities of PEDOT:PSS films are not changed when PDIN layers are prepared by the DSC method.

To clarify the effect of the preparation method of PDIN layers on the photovoltaic parameters of OSCs, the photocurrent density versus the effective voltage (Jph − Veff) of all OSCs were investigated and are shown in Fig. 2c and d. The Jph is defined as the difference between the light current density (JL) and dark current density (JD). The Veff is defined as the difference between the voltage corresponding to Jph = 0 and the applied voltage (Vapp). The Jph of the S-PDIN layer was enhanced along with the increase of Veff without coming into a saturated state, which may result from the efficient charge collection outside the active area due to the enhanced conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer treated with methanol. The Jph of OSCs with the D-PDIN layer can reach a saturated state under about 0.3 V Veff conditions, indicating that photogenerated charges in the active area are completely collected by the counter electrodes. The photogenerated charges outside the active area can hardly be collected due to the limited conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The Jph − Veff curves were investigated for all OSCs with a shadow mask to further demonstrate this assumption. Obviously, the Jphs of all OSCs can reach the saturated state under 0.3 V Veff conditions. This phenomenon further demonstrates that conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is enhanced for PDIN layers prepared by the SSC method, resulting in the virtual high JSC of OSCs with S-PDIN without a shadow mask.
To further investigate the effect of the PDIN layer preparation method on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, the active layers were solvent vapor annealed (SVA) by different solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform (CF). A series of OSCs were fabricated with different SVA treated active layers, as well as with S-PDIN or D-PDIN as the interfacial layer. The J–V curves of OSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 without or with a shadow mask, as shown in Fig. S2a and b (ESI). The detailed photovoltaic parameters of OSCs are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). Virtually high JSCs were still observed from the OSCs with the S-PDIN layer, further suggesting that the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be enhanced for the PDIN layers prepared by the SSC method. This assumption can be further demonstrated from the measured photovoltaic parameters of OSCs with a shadow mask. Similar photovoltaic parameters are obtained for the OSCs with the S-PDIN or D-PDIN layer under the measurement conditions with a shadow mask. To investigate the effect of methanol on the morphology of the active layers, the morphology of the active layers was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). According to the TEM images of blend films with or without methanol SSC treatment, no obvious change can be observed without or after methanol treatment. The unchanged morphology can well explain the similar performance of OSCs with the S-PDIN or D-PDIN layers under the same measurement conditions with a shadow mask. Meanwhile, the unchanged morphology of the active layers after methanol treatment also indicates that the virtual high JSC of OSCs with S-PDIN layers is not induced by the effect of methanol on the morphology of the active layers.
To visually demonstrate the effect of methanol-enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS layers on OSC performance, part of the PEDOT:PSS layers were directly treated with methanol by the SSC or DSC method. On these kinds of PEDOT:PSS layers, a series of OSCs were prepared with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/D-PDIN/Al. The J–V curves of the OSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 without or with a shadow mask, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. It is apparent that virtual high JSCs were obtained from the OSCs with a methanol treated PEDOT:PSS layer, which may be due to the additional photogenerated charge collection outside the active area induced by the enhanced conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The three kinds of OSCs exhibit mostly overlapped J–V curves under the measurement conditions with a shadow mask, and no additional photogenerated charges can be collected outside the shadow mask. The EQE spectra of three kinds of OSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 3c. The EQE spectra mostly overlap for the three kinds of OSCs in the whole spectral range, which well agrees with the corresponding J–V curves of OSCs with a shadow mask. The calculated JSCs can be obtained by integrating the EQE spectra of OSCs. The calculated JSCs are very close to the measured JSCs of OSCs with a shadow mask. However, the calculated JSCs of OSCs with methanol treated PEDOT:PSS are much lower than the measured values of OSCs without a shadow mask. The virtual high JSCs lead to 13.61% or 14.53% PCE of OSCs with the DSC method methanol treated PEDOT:PSS or SSC method methanol treated PEDOT:PSS layer, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of OSCs without or with a shadow mask are summarized in Table 2. The rather high PCEs of OSCs with a methanol treated PEDOT:PSS layer should result from the additional photogenerated charge collection outside the active area, which is similar to the OSCs with a S-PDIN layer and can’t really reflect the real performance of OSCs. The JSCs of OSCs can be evaluated according to the absorption spectra of the active layer and solar light irradiation spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3d. Assuming that EQE values are 80% in the whole spectral response range, the maximal JSCs arrive at 21.74 mA cm−2 for the absorption edge at 800 nm, 26.86 mA cm−2 for the absorption edge at 900 nm and 30.28 mA cm−2 for the absorption edge at 1000 nm, respectively. If the measured JSCs are larger than the calculated maximal values, much more attention should be paid to the OSCs with a solution processed interfacial layer.

The morphology of the pristine PEDOT:PSS films and methanol-enhanced conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4. According to the height images, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are approximately 1.11 nm and 0.79 nm for the pristine and methanol treated PEDOT:PSS films, which may result from the removal of PSS from the PEDOT:PSS films. From the phase images, PEDOT-rich grains or PSS-rich grains are individually indicated by the bright or dark domains. It is apparent that the bright PEDOT-rich grains become a more stretched network in the PEDOT:PSS treated by methanol, which is beneficial to improve its conductivity. Ouyang et al. reported that only some PEDOT chains change to the linear or extended-coil conformation, which may lead to the stronger inter-chain interactions for better inter-chain charge transport. The enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films may result in the additional photogenerated charge collection outside the active area for the OSCs without a shadow mask during J–V measurement, which can well explain the virtual high JSCs and relatively low FFs of OSCs.
For the basic investigation on OSCs in a laboratory, the optimized characterization method is employed with an appropriate shadow mask during J–V measurement of OSCs. The area of the shadow mask should be close to the active area defined by the vertically overlapped electrodes, which is beneficial to obtain the real performance of the prepared OSCs. If the shadow mask is much smaller than that active area, VOC and FF of OSCs may be affected. The efficient OSCs should have well balanced JSC and FF, which obeys the working mechanism of OSCs. Virtual high JSCs may result from the additional photogenerated charge collection outside the active area due to the enhanced conductivity of electrode interfacial layers, also with a relatively low FF and a constant VOC. This experimental result exhibits solid evidence for the necessity of a shadow mask for OSC measurement, especially for the OSCs with a solution processed interfacial layer.

Virtual high JSCs of OSCs may be obtained due to the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, which is also accompanied by a relatively low FF. A best PCE of 13.88% can be obtained with virtual high JSCs of 26.45 mA cm−2 and rather low FF of 58.94% for OSCs without a shadow mask during measurement. The PCE is 12.41% with the balanced JSC of 18.45 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.33% for the same OSC with a shadow mask during measurement. The OSCs exhibit greatly different JSCs and FFs under the same measurement conditions without or with a shadow mask, which may be due to the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS during the preparation of the PDIN layer by the SSC method. An appropriate shadow mask is necessary to measure the J–V curves of OSCs with solution processed interfacial layers, which can avoid collecting the photogenerated charge outside of the active area due to the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. This experimental result shows that a well-balanced JSC and FF should be an evaluating indicator for efficient OSCs, and an appropriate shadow mask is necessary to characterize the performance of OSCs with a solution processed interfacial layer.
