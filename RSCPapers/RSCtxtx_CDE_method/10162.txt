A new non-fullerene acceptor PDFC is prepared by introducing perylene diimide into the core of an A–DA′D–A architecture. Due to the large conjugation and electron-deficient ability of perylene diimide, PDFC shows strong absorption, suitable energy levels and favorable face-on packing. The optimal device realizes a PCE of 12.56% with one of the highest fill factors (81.3%). A PCE of 9.66% is obtained in a 570 nm thick-film device based on PDFC.

Over the past few decades, organic conjugated molecules with unique semiconducting properties have been widely used in organic optoelectronic devices. To broaden the application and improve the device performance, the creation of new molecules with novel chemical structure has drawn extensive attention. For example, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has achieved explosive growth due to the innovation of non-fullerene acceptors, which possess excellent structural tunability compared to their fullerene counterparts, and thus enriching the library of organic semiconductors to meet the requirements during the complex photon-to-charge conversion in OSCs. In terms of the existing non-fullerene acceptors, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREA) with the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture and perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have been most intensively studied. The PDI derivatives usually show excellent chemical/thermal stability and strong light absorption. Notably, the large conjugated planarity of the PDI moiety endows the acceptors with strong π–π stacking, which is beneficial for achieving high electron mobility but also raises another issue that the extreme aggregation and severe phase separation in blend films severely restrain the exciton dissociation. Meanwhile, due to the push–pull structure in FREA, the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) extends the absorption to the near-infrared range so that FREA can take advantage of more photons to realize high short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, the strong ICT effect inevitably brings the low lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leading to relatively low open circuit voltage (Voc). In addition, most of the high performance OSCs are based on very thin active layers of around 100 nm, which might be correlated with the fact that the longer transporting distance of free carriers with mediocre mobility increases the probability of charge recombination. The requirement of thin films restrains the practicability in large-scale manufacture.

Recently, Zou et al. reported a new FREA namely Y6 with A–DA′D–A architecture wherein the original D core is replaced by a fused DA′D core involving an electron-deficient benzothiadiazole moiety. Then, the device achieved simultaneously high Voc and Jsc attributed to the low energy loss and near-infrared absorption, respectively. Subsequently, the PCEs of OSCs based on Y6 or Y6 analogues have realized ∼18%, demonstrating that the A–DA′D–A architecture is a promising molecular skeleton for non-fullerene acceptors. Therefore, this inspired us to design a new acceptor by introducing a PDI moiety into the A–DA′D–A structure as the electron-deficient A′ part. The large conjugation of the PDI moiety can enhance the π–π stacking to form pathways for charge transport and the electron-deficient capability of PDI is able to tune the ICT effect and frontier orbital energy levels. Meanwhile, the A–DA′D–A structure helps this acceptor to realize the balance of miscibility and crystallinity. Briefly, the new acceptor is able to combine both the merits of PDI and FREA.
Herein, a new non-fullerene acceptor namely PDFC is designed as shown in Fig. 1. A PDI moiety flank fused with two indacenodithiophene (IDT) units was employed as the DA′D core, and two 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) units were used as terminal groups. As expected, PDFC shows strong absorption in the visible range with suitable energy levels. When blending with donor polymer PM6 (Scheme S1, ESI), the optimal device achieves an excellent PCE of 12.56% with a high Voc of 0.97 V. More importantly, the favorable face-on packing of PDFC and PM6 is beneficial for the charge transport in the vertical direction, while hole/electron mobilities are balanced with a ratio of 1.04, consequently leading to an extraordinary fill factor (FF) of 81.3% which is one of the highest FFs in OSCs. Moreover, the FF remains as high as 62% in a 570 nm thick active layer, providing a PCE of 9.66%.
The synthetic route of PDFC is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI). The dibromide PDI reacted with IDT stannane to afford the unfused DA′D core isomers, which could be separated by flash column chromatography. Then, the aldehyde group is introduced, followed by the fusion of the PDI and IDT moieties. Finally, the Knoevenagel condensation reaction involving a fused DA′D core and 2FIC terminal groups was carried out to provide the target molecule PDFC. The chemical structure has been confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR and mass spectra. PDFC exhibits good solubility in common solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene.
To investigate the molecular geometry, the theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level is performed. The long alkyl chains in the PDI and IDT units are replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculation. As shown in Fig. 2a, the optimized molecular configuration suggests PDFC has an almost planar backbone with an extremely small dihedral angle of 0.003° between the DA′D core and 2FIC units, leading to a large conjugation. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), the single crystal of PDFC further confirmed the small dihedral angle of about 2.14°. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), the LUMO delocalizes over the PDI and 2FIC units and such distribution will improve the electron transport compared to the acceptors, whose LUMO localizes in the electron-deficient terminal.
The optical characteristics of PDFC are studied by UV-vis absorption. The spectra of PDFC and PM6 are shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. S3a (ESI) and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI). In a dilute (1.5 × 10−7 M L−1) chloroform solution, PDFC shows sharp absorption in the 600–700 nm region with an extinction coefficient of 4.32 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 683 nm. In the solid state, the absorption maximum peak red-shifts to 691 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1.45 × 105 cm−1. Notably, the extinction coefficients in both solution and film are significantly higher than those of previously reported PDI acceptors, which is attributed to the large conjugation and ICT effect. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of PDFC is calculated from the thin film onset (725 nm) to be 1.71 eV.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of PDFC. With ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal standard, as is shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3b (ESI), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of PDFC were evaluated from the redox onset potentials to be −5.57 eV and −3.85 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO of the corresponding donor PM6 are measured under the same conditions to be −5.54 eV/−3.69 eV, which are matchable with PDFC. The electrochemical band gap (1.72 eV) is consistent with the result calculated from UV-vis absorption.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of PDFC, OSCs were fabricated by using the conventional bulk heterojunction architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ZnO/Ag with PM6 as the donor material and PDFC as the acceptor material. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, the optimal device shows a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 15.93 mA cm−2, and a FF of 81.3%, resulting in a PCE of 12.56% based on ∼120 nm thickness of the active layer. Attributed to the high lying LUMO of PDFC, the Voc is significantly higher than other acceptors with 2FIC as the terminal group. To understand the voltage loss in the device, electroluminescence and highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (EQE) were characterized as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The energy of the charge transfer state (ECT) is 1.54 eV, while the voltage losses due to radiative recombination (ΔE2) and non-radiative recombination (ΔE3) are 0.26 eV and 0.31 eV, respectively (Table S2, ESI). The EQE curve of the optimal PM6:PDFC devices is shown in Fig. 3b. The value of the photoresponse is nearly 80% in the range of 550–650 nm, which is from the contributions of both PM6 and PDFC. This high photoresponse rationalizes the decent Jsc although the absorption of the blend film is limited in the visible range. The Jsc value (15.75 mA cm−2) calculated from the EQE has less than 5% deviation with Jsc measured from the current–voltage (J–V) curve. Noting that the FF herein is one of the highest values in OSCs, thick-film OSCs were fabricated to further evaluate the potential of PDFC for OSCs. By tuning the solution concentration and film-forming condition, active layers with varied thicknesses from 120 nm to 570 nm were obtained. The J–V curves are plotted in Fig. 3a, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 1. With a 300 nm thick film, the Jsc achieves the biggest value of 16.51 mA cm−2, while the FF is 73.6%, providing a PCE of 11.66%. When the active layer thickness increased to 570 nm, the PCE and FF were still as high as 9.66% and 62.0%, respectively. With increase of the thickness of the active layer, more photons can be absorbed, while the charge collection probability becomes worse due to the longer distance of free charge and more traps for charge recombination. Therefore, the FF gradually decreases, while the values of Jsc rise firstly and then decrease, leading to the declining tendency of PCEs.

To investigate the exciton and charge behaviors, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and the charge collection probability (Pcoll) are estimated from the curve of photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) as shown Fig. S6 (ESI). In the optimal device with a 120 nm thick active layer, Pdiss and Pcoll are 97.8% and 90.8%, respectively. Moreover, charge mobility is measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in the Table S3 and Fig. S8 (ESI), the PDFC-based device presents a hole mobility of 6.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 7.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a ratio (μe/μh) of 1.04. The Voc as a function of the illumination intensity slope plot helps to determine the type of charge recombination in OSCs. When the slope is 1kT/q, bimolecular recombination is dominant. A stronger dependence of Voc on light intensity with a slope of 2kT/q means that trap-assisted recombination is dominant. As shown in Fig. S6b (ESI), the values of slope for the PM6:PDFC device with a 120 nm thickness active layer is 1.15kT/q, suggesting that bimolecular recombination is dominant in these devices. Meanwhile the linear scaling of photocurrent to light intensity is demonstrated for the PDFC-based devices with 120 nm thickness active layer with the exponential factor of 0.984, indicating that bimolecular recombination is effectively suppressed. These results are consistent with the high FF of 81.3%.
Considering that the device performance highly relied on the morphology and microstructure of the active layer, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the PDFC neat film and the PM6:PDFC blend film. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI), an obvious crystal domain is evident in the PDFC neat film with root-mean-square surface (RMS) roughness of 2.42 nm. When blending with donor PM6, uniform films are obtained with varied thicknesses (Fig. 4 and Fig. S9, ESI), exhibiting RMS roughness of 1.33 nm (120 nm thick film) and 1.60 nm (300 nm thick film), respectively, indicating that PDFC has good compatibility and miscibility with PM6. Meanwhile, fiber-like domains are observed in the blend film, suggesting that there is appropriate phase separation. Furthermore, the PM6:PDFC blend film was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI), the blend film shows evident fibrous grains, which is consistent with the results of AFM.
To further explore the effect of microstructure on the device performance, the blend film was studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS scattering profiles and 1D cutline profiles of out-of-the-plane (OOP, qz) and in-the-plane (IP, qxy) are shown in Fig. 4. The neat PDFC film shows a preferential face-on π–π stacking with qz at 1.64 Å−1 corresponding to a π–π distance of 3.83 Å. Interestingly, there are two signals peaking at 0.53 Å−1 in OOP and 0.38 Å−1 in IP, which might originate from the lamellar packing of two types of side chains of PDFC. In the PM6:PDFC blend film, PM6 predominates the intermolecular packing with a strong π–π stacking at 1.71 Å−1 in OOP, where the face-on packing of PDFC is overlaid. PM6 also shows bimodal lamellar peaks at around 0.3 Å−1 in both the OOP and IP directions. The face-on packing resulting from both PDFC and PM6 is beneficial for the carrier transport in the vertical direction, which rationalizes the high and balanced hole/electron mobilities.
In conclusion, a new non-fullerene acceptor PDFC has been designed by introducing a PDI moiety into the A–DA′D–A architecture. PDFC combines the merits of perylene diimide and fused-ring electron acceptors. The large conjugation ensures the favorable face-on packing in either neat or blend films, thus improving the charge transport in OSCs. The blend film of PM6 and PDFC shows high and balanced carrier mobilities of both electrons (7.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and holes (6.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) with a ratio of 1.04 (μe/μh). The ICT effect endows PDFC with strong absorption and delocalized frontier orbitals, which are helpful for exciton generation and dissociation. Consequently, the optimal device based on PM6:PDFC achieves both high Voc (0.97 V) and high Jsc (15.93 mA cm−2), providing a PCE of 12.56%. Notably, the FF of 81.3% is one of the highest values in OSCs. Furthermore, the PDFC-based devices are less sensitive to the thickness of the active layer. Even in a 570 nm thick active layer, a PCE of 9.66% was obtained. Our results provide an effective strategy for designing new acceptors for thick-film non-fullerene OSCs.
