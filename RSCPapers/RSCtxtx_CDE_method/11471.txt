TiO2 compact layers (CLs) prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) from an aqueous nanoparticle suspension were used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to prevent charge recombination at the interface between the transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and the electrolyte. The TiO2 nanopowder (ca. 4.5 nm diameter) suspension used in the EPD process was prepared via a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis pilot plant (at a production rate of ca. 0.38 kg h−1). The optimal thickness of the TiO2 CL for DSSCs is about 115 nm. Compared to the DSSCs without a CL, the optimal cell has shown improved short-circuit current density (JSC) and solar energy conversion efficiency by 13.1% and 15.0%, respectively. The mechanism for improved performance has been studied by the measurements of dark current and electrochemical impedance spectra. The interfacial charge transfer resistance at the FTO/electrolyte interface is increased after fabricating a CL in the cell, indicating inhibited electron recombination at the interface.

Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive interest due to the simple apparatus and cheap materials required in the fabrication process. Since 1991, when DSSCs were first introduced by O'Regan and Grätzel, the conversion efficiency in small area cells has reached ca. 12%. A typical DSSC is composed of a working electrode usually made from a mesoporous TiO2 network coated with dye molecules on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a counter electrode (usually a Pt layer coated on the FTO substrate) and a redox electrolyte. The photoexcited electrons produced in the dye are injected into the conduction band of TiO2 upon illumination of the working electrode, and then are transferred to the FTO substrate. Meanwhile, the mediator in the electrolyte can reduce the oxidized dye and transfer positive charge to the counter electrode. The interfaces in DSSCs include FTO/TiO2 porous layer, porous TiO2 layer/dye molecules, dye molecules/electrolyte, and electrolyte/counter electrode, which play a significant role for unidirectional charge flow so as to improve the energy conversion efficiency. However, it is noted that charge recombination at the interface of the FTO substrate and the electrolyte cannot be neglected because the porous structure of TiO2 cannot completely inhibit the percolation of the electrolyte into FTO which provides a path for recombination. In this case, the physical contact between the electrolyte and the FTO surface, leads to a back flow of electrons, which can recombine with the electrolyte. Hence, the introduction of a blocking layer (i.e. a compact layer) between FTO and the photoanode is important to inhibit the electron leakage and increase the overall efficiency of the device, and is critically important for solid DSSCs.

Thin layers of Nb2O5, HfO2, Cr2O3, SrCO3, ZnO, and TiO2 have been deposited on conductive glass substrates acting as the CL, which have been shown to improve the cell efficiency. TiO2 appears to be the most popular CL and acts to prevent physical contact between FTO and the electrolyte without inhibiting electron transfer (from the conduction band of TiO2 to FTO). Consequently, the short-circuit current density (JSC) can be improved. It is noted that an accumulation of photogenerated electrons in the photoanode can occur if an energy barrier exists between the FTO and the photoanode due to the different alignment of energy levels for the photoanode and the CL (such as the case for a TiO2 photoanode and a ZnO CL), resulting in an increase in VOC (open circuit voltage).
TiO2 CLs have been prepared by various methods such as sol–gel, layer by layer, spray pyrolysis, spin coating, and sputtering. Many of these methods are time consuming, multi-step, and require high temperatures or a high vacuum. For wet chemical methods, environmentally unfriendly organic solvents are often used. Though the hydrolysis of TiCl4 has been used to prepare the CLs for DSSCs, this method usually results in a relatively loose structure and the presence of harmful chloride ions and requires a post, high-temperature annealing process. Thus, electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has attracted interest as a low cost, simple and fast method for making uniform thin films with controlled thickness. Often, the best quality EPD films are obtained using well dispersed and stable suspensions that are prepared from TiO2 nanoparticles with an organic solvent, e.g. 2-methoxyethanol, a mixed solvent of tert-butanol and acetonitrile, isopropanol, a mixture of water and methanol, or acetone with a small amount of water and iodine. However, it is noted that electrostatic repulsion is less effective in non-aqueous media than that in pure water due to the low dielectric constant of non-aqueous liquids. A water based and thus, green solvent suspension is thus favoured.
TiO2 nanoparticles are usually prepared by conventional synthesis methods such as sol–gel, batch hydrothermal, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and so on. It is noted that those obtained nanoparticles usually exhibit poor dispersability in water due to the absence of ionisable surface species. TiO2 nanopowders can also be prepared by the continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) method that uses water as a solvent and reagent. CHFS has the advantage of giving uniform particle size and being readily scalable to the kg h−1 scale. In the absence of organic additives/solvent, TiO2 nanoparticles made via CHFS show reasonable dispersability in water due to the surface hydroxyl groups.
In this work, we report the synthesis of TiO2 CLs via an EPD method using an aqueous suspension of negatively charged TiO2 anatase nanocrystals prepared by the CHFS method. The thickness of the CLs was adjusted by changing coating conditions such as deposition current and time. The influence of different TiO2 CLs on the performance of DSSCs was investigated.

Titanium oxysulphate hydrate (TiOSO4·H2O (98%)) and KOH (99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK). Iodine (I2), anhydrous lithium iodide (LiI), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI) were purchased from Aldrich. Commercial TiO2 paste (18% of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, particle size 20 nm), N719 dye and FTO glass (14 Ω □−1) were obtained from the Wuhan Geao Science Apparatus Company, China. Chloroplatinic acid (≥37.5% Pt basis), acetonitrile (≥99.9%) and t-butanol (≥99.0%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanol (≥99.7%), acetone (AR), isopropanol (AR), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, AR), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR) were bought from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Corporation. Milli-Q water with a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm was used in all experiments. All chemicals were used without further purification.


The TiO2 nanoparticles used for the fabrication of the CLs were synthesized using a previously reported pilot scale CHFS system capable of producing ca. 2 kg h−1 of nanoparticles. Typically, an aqueous solution of titanium oxysulphate (0.4 M) was pumped to meet a flow of KOH solution (0.2 M) at room temperature in a T-junction (Fig. 1). This mixture was then rapidly mixed with a stream of supercritical water (450 °C, 240 bar) in reactor (Fig. 1) as detailed in the previous publications of some of the authors, whereupon rapid precipitation of crystalline anatase occurred (via rapid hydrolysis and dehydration of the titanium salt). The TiO2 suspension was cooled in flow via a water-cooled jacket heat exchanger and an off-white slurry was collected at the exit of the back-pressure regulator. The supercritical water feed was at 450 °C and 240 bar, whilst the other liquid feeds were at room temperature initially. Pump rates of 400, 200 and 200 mL min−1 were used for pump 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Slurries were then centrifuged, washed twice and freeze-dried at ca. 133 Pa for 22 h.


The suspensions of the TiO2 nanoparticles for EPD were prepared by the following procedure. TiO2 nanoparticles (1.0 g) were thoroughly mixed with 100 mL of deionized water. The pH value of the resultant suspension was adjusted by the addition of HCl (36–38%) or NaOH to 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12, respectively. Then, the adjusted suspensions were treated by sonication for 20 min to produce the suspension used in the EPD experiments. Dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano ZS) was used to measure the zeta potential of the colloidal particles, which is closely related to colloidal stability.

FTO glass was pre-cleaned before EPD under sonication for 15 min in ethanol, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. A three-electrode electrophoretic cell was employed for EPD. The FTO substrate (with an active area of 1.5 × 0.8 cm2), platinum plate (1.0 × 1.0 cm2), and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The electrodes were immersed into the suspension of 80 mL in a 100 mL three-neck bottle. The working electrode and counter electrode were kept in parallel. EPD was performed with the above-prepared suspension using a square-wave pulse current on a potentiostat (Corrtest CS300). A current of 0.55, 0.75, or 0.95 mA was first kept for 60 ms in each cycle for polarization, and then was returned to 0 mA for 4 ms for depolarization. Cycle numbers of 500, 1000 and 2000 were used to prepare the CLs with different thicknesses. Prior to testing the thin films were dried at 70 °C on a hot plate.

Sandwich-structured DSSCs were fabricated using the following procedure. The FTO substrates with and without TiO2 CLs were coated with commercial TiO2 paste using the doctor blade technique to form porous TiO2 films, followed by sintering on a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 min, 125 °C for 6 min, 325 °C for 15 min, 375 °C for 10 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 10 min, respectively (the thickness of the films was ca. 8 μm after sintering). The resultant electrodes were then immersed in a 20 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. After being washed with Milli-Q water and ethanol, the electrodes were annealed at 450 °C on a hot plate for 30 min. They were then cooled down to 80 °C, followed by being immersed into a 0.3 mM solution of N719 (the solvent is a mixture of acetonitrile and t-butanol with a volume ratio of 1:1) for 24 h. The obtained dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes with an active area of 1.5 cm2 were assembled into solar cells, with an electrolyte containing 50 mM of I2, 0.1 M of LiI, 0.6 M of DMPImI, and 0.5 M of TBP in acetonitrile. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by thermal decomposition of spin-coated chloroplatinic acid (30 mM of isopropanol solution) at 385 °C for 30 min.


XRD patterns of TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (0.1541 nm). TEM images were collected using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (UHR), for which the samples were prepared by applying a drop of suspension onto amorphous carbon-coated copper grids and dried in air. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were observed with a field-emission SEM (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The thickness of the deposited thin films was also measured by FE-SEM. Absorption spectra were carried out in transmission mode using a Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda750). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSSCs were performed using a potentiostat (CHI 660D) in the dark under a bias of 0.69 V in the frequency range 0.01–105 Hz. The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a solar simulator (Model 69907, Oriel) and a Keithley source meter (2420) under illumination of AM 1.5G light with an intensity of 85 mW cm−2. A mask with a window of 0.15 cm2 was clipped on the TiO2 side to define the active area of the cells.


The as-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles made with the CHFS reactor are obtained as an off-white, free flowing powder with ca. 90% yield after freeze-drying. As the powders are prepared from an aqueous medium, hydroxyl groups on the particle surface make it easy to prepare suspensions in an organic free aqueous solution. The particle size is about 4 to 5 nm according to the TEM images (Fig. 2).

XRD was used to determine the average crystallite size and phase of the as-prepared TiO2 samples (Fig. 3). All of the peaks can be indexed to an anatase phase. The peaks at 25.3, 36.9, 37.8, 38.6, 48.0, 53.9, 55.1, 62.7, 68.8, 70.3, and 75.0 can be ascribed to the (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220) and (215) planes of anatase, respectively (JCPDF Card No. 65-5714). The crystallite size can be estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (101) diffraction peak using the Debye–Scherrer equation (D = 0.94λ/βcosθ, where D is the average crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of X-ray radiation, β is the FWHM, and θ is the diffraction angle). The crystallite size calculated from the diffraction data (ca. 4.5 nm) is consistent with that determined from the TEM images (Fig. 2).

In EPD, charged particles migrate towards the electrode of opposite charge under a bias across the suspension, for which the migration velocity is proportional to the magnitude of the surface charge or zeta potential (ζ). Since the ζ can be considered the potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the dispersed particle, its value is also related to the stability of colloidal dispersions. To achieve good thin films prepared by an EPD method, the colloidal suspension should exhibit good stability and more importantly a high magnitude of surface charge. Thus, it is important to tune the ζ of the suspension of TiO2 nanoparticles before deposition to optimize the deposition.

The ζ of TiO2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension can be controlled by the pH of the solution through the protonation and deprotonation of surface hydroxyl species. Particles are negatively charged in an alkaline aqueous suspension and positively charged in an acidic suspension. So the ζ shifts towards a negative direction with increasing pH values. Moreover, the ζ becomes less positive in an acidic suspension with an increase in pH value, while it becomes more negative in an alkaline suspension (Table 1). When the pH value is lower than 7, however, it is noted that the suspension is not stable and the particles precipitate quickly. The suspension with a pH > 7 is fairly stable for at least a couple of hours. Since a high pH value can result in the evolution of oxygen gas (from water electrolysis), a pH value of 10 rather than 12 was used to prepare the CLs via the EPD method.

The quality of the TiO2 CLs is determined by the EPD parameters. Here the optimization of the resultant CLs is achieved by optimization of the polarization current and the cycle numbers of the square-wave pulse. In each cycle, the electrode is first polarized for 60 ms at 0.55, 0.75, or 0.95 mA and then returned to 0 mA for 4 ms for depolarization. Fig. 4 shows the relationship of electrode potential with time for 500, 1000, and 2000 cycles, respectively. The obtained films are denoted in terms of “current-cycles”. For instance, 0.75–500 means the film prepared with 0.75 mA and 500 cycles. Obviously, the electrode potential increases with the polarization current, regardless of the cycle numbers.

The electrode potential increases slowly after the initial fast increase during EPD for the case of a small cycle number of 500, regardless of the polarization current. For the case of a large cycle number of 1000 or 2000, the electrode potential increases slowly after the initial fast increase with polarization currents of 0.55 and 0.75 mA, while there is a second sharp increase in the curve with a polarization current of 0.95 mA. This suggests that the impedance at the interface increases greatly, corresponding to the evolution of oxygen bubbles. The resultant oxygen cannot disperse into the suspension in time and, thus, accumulates at the surface of the deposition layer or even penetrates into the layer. With the increase in potential, more and more oxygen bubbles are produced and they may diffuse into the suspension relatively fast. Eventually, a new quasi-equilibrium is established, leading to a slow potential increase over time again. As a matter of fact, the slope of this curve for the samples prepared with a current of 0.95 mA is much higher than the others, suggesting that oxygen evolution may occur even in the early stage of deposition. Since gas evolution can give rise to holes and even cracks in the thin film, here a high polarization current such as 0.95 mA was not used to prepare the CLs.
Since a good CL should exhibit good transparency, UV-vis absorption spectra in transmission mode of the as-prepared films were measured with the FTO substrate as a reference (Fig. 5). A high current corresponds to low transmittance for the samples with the same cycle numbers, indicating the thickness of the obtained films increases with the increase in current. The thickness of the thin films also increases with an increase in cycle numbers (with the same polarization current), moreover, the transmittance decreases with an increase in cycle numbers (Fig. 5).

Fig. 6 shows SEM images of the as-prepared films. The TiO2 films deposited under a polarization current of 0.75 mA exhibit a more dense morphology than those deposited under 0.55 mA with the same cycle numbers. This is because a higher current means a faster velocity of particle migration during deposition. It is noted that many holes and even cracks can be observed in the 0.95–2000 sample, which is caused by the aforementioned oxygen evolution during film preparation and water evaporation upon film drying at a high temperature in thick films.
As mentioned above, a good CL for DSSCs requires a dense thin film with a high transmittance. Therefore, here the polarization current of 0.75 mA was used to prepare TiO2 CLs. The respective thicknesses of the resultant layers are 90, 115, and 195 nm for 0.75–500, 0.75–1000, and 0.75–2000 according to the sectional analysis of the SEM images (Fig. 7).


Fig. 8a shows photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs with different TiO2 CLs, prepared using a polarization current of 0.75 mA. The device without the CL was used as a control cell for comparison. The photovoltaic parameters, such as short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and overall power conversion efficiency are listed in Table 2. Compared with the control cell, the photovoltaic performance of the cells with a CL is enhanced, specifically the JSC and cell efficiency are improved. The JSC increases in the order of control <0.75–500 < 0.75–2000 < 0.75–1000. The 0.75–1000 device shows the highest JSC of 16.48 mA cm−2, which is about 13.1% higher than that of the control cell. This is because the presence of a CL can prevent physical contact between FTO and the electrolyte, resulting in the efficient inhibition of back flow of the electrons in FTO to the electrolyte and an overall increase in the efficiency of the DSSC. Thus, the recombination of electrons in FTO with the redox couple in the electrolyte is suppressed, leading to an improved JSC. Within a reasonable range of thickness, the JSC increases with increasing thickness of the CL; while if the thickness is too high, the JSC decreases again due to the increase of the CL resistance and a decrease of transmittance. This explains why the DSSC with the 0.75–2000 CL has a lower JSC than that with the 0.75–1000 CL.

It is noted that the dark current measurements can be used to study the back flow of electrons.Fig. 8b shows the dark current density–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs with and without CLs. The onset of dark current shifts to a high forward bias for the DSSCs with a CL, implying a decrease in the dark current density. Thus, the CLs prepared by a EPD method can efficiently suppress electron recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface.
The fill factors (FF) for the 0.75–500 sample and the 0.75–1000 sample are slightly higher than that of the control cell, which may be due to both the improved interfacial adhesion between the TiO2 photoanode and the FTO and a reduced electron recombination caused by the CL. The reason that the FF decreases in the sample order 0.75–2000 < 0.75–1000 < 0.75–500 may be that the resistance of a CL (and thus the interfacial charge transfer) increases with increasing CL thickness. This may also explain the observed change in the VOC. Moreover, it is suggested that the slight change in VOC is also because no obvious accumulation of photogenerated electrons occurs in the TiO2 photoanode since no energy barrier exists between the FTO and photoanode (as the same material of TiO2 is used for both the CL and the photoanode). Due to the combined effect of JSC, FF and VOC, therefore, the cell efficiency increases in the order of control 0.75–2000 < 0.75–500 < 0.75–1000. The 0.75–1000 sample exhibits the highest efficiency of 7.98%, which is about 15.0% higher than that of the control cell (6.94%).
EIS characterization was used to further study the influence of the CL on device performance. Two semi-circles appear in the spectra for all of the samples (Fig. 9). The impedance parameters are determined according to the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 9 (Table 3). The Rct1 in the low frequency region and the Rct2 in the high frequency region correspond to the charge transfer resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, respectively. The Rct1 determined in the dark can be used to represent charge recombination resistance, as electrons are injected into the photoanode under an external bias in the dark, followed by recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. The Rs is the serial resistance across the device. Because all of the components of the DSSCs (like the electrolyte, the dye, and the counter electrode) are the same except the CL, there is almost no change in Rs and Rct2. It is noted that the value of Rct1 for all the DSSCs with a CL is higher than that of the control (Table 3), indicating that the electron recombination is suppressed due to the physical block of the CLs. Although a high resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface can suppress charge recombination, a large blocking effect did not necessarily lead to high efficiency since other factors like transmittance of the CL could also influence the cell performance. As discussed above, therefore, there is an optimized thickness of CL for use in DSSCs.

In summary, herein we report a simple fabrication route to nano-grained TiO2 CLs for use in DSSCs via an EPD method using an aqueous suspension of TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of ca. 4.5 nm. The well dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized via a scaled up continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis pilot plant (rate of 0.38 kg h−1). The resultant CL can efficiently block electron transfer back to the electrolyte from the FTO, leading to an improvement in cell efficiency. We envisage that this work can afford a feasible way for the simple, green fabrication of TiO2 CLs for use in DSSCs.
