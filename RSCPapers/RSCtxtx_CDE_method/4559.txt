Improvement of the power conversion efficiency and long term stability remains to be of crucial importance for the further development of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a donor–acceptor copolymer based on 4,8-di(thiophene-2′-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) and 4,7-di(thiophene-2′-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT), specifically selected because of its suitability for roll-coating in the ambient environment, is investigated in terms of operational stability via partial exchange (5 or 10%) of the alkyl side chain on either the donor or the acceptor monomer with a 2-hydroxyethyl or 2-phenylethyl group. It is shown that the exchange of the hexyl chain on the DTBT moiety has a negative impact on the stability of the polymer as well as on the performance of the resulting PSCs. On the other hand, partial exchange of the 2-hexyldecyl side chain of the BDT unit by a 2-hydroxyethyl group results in an improved photochemical stability of the polymer film and a higher efficiency of 5.6% for the spin-coated PSC. The stability of roll-coated devices also slightly increases with the incorporation of 10% of either the 2-hydroxyethyl or 2-phenylethyl side chain.

Advanced conjugated polymers have been extensively studied for polymer solar cells (PSCs) over the past two decades, illustrating the remarkable potential of this technology for large scale photovoltaic applications by taking into account their specific advantages (printable, flexible, light weight, and so on). Most research efforts have focused on improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and currently reported record values exceed 11%. However, the scalability, while retaining the high efficiency, of these small active area (e.g. 5.9 mm2) PSCs remains to be a challenging task.

The common method for preparing high efficiency PSCs is bulk heterojunction (BHJ), in which most often a fullerene derivative (like [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)) functions as an electron acceptor and an organic light absorbing low bandgap conjugated polymer acts as an electron donor in a blended, interpenetrating solid-state mixture forming the photoactive layer (PAL). The specific structure of the organic photoactive layer, however, has some implications for the stability of the resulting PSCs. For example, the polymer (alkyl) side chains, present to allow processing from solution, can induce multiple degradation pathways, triggered by thermal stress, light exposure and/or oxygen. Moreover, phase separation of the electron donor and acceptor component within the PAL has been identified as one of the main problems in BHJ PSCs. To resolve this issue, efforts have been made to ‘freeze’ the morphology of the PAL, e.g. by cross-linking the polymers or fullerene derivatives, or the implementation of additives to improve the blend stability. Alternatively, side chain removal strategies on the deposited PAL films have been reported. Krebs et al. reported the removal of alkyl ester side chains upon applying a thermal treatment at 300 °C, resulting in an insoluble polymer and a more stable PAL. However, at the required temperature, this approach can hardly be translated to the roll-coating (RC) production of solar cells on plastic foils. Another strategy employs chemical diversification of the side chains of the light absorbing polymers. Such a diversification was already used in a study by Friend et al. in 1999 resulting in an enhanced photo- and thermal stability, respectively, of a phenyl substituted poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV). This concept was then adopted in this study to improve the photo- and thermal stability. Maes et al. showed that a reduction of the side chain density in a polymer based on 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) and quinoxaline leads to a PSC with increased PCE as well as enhanced device stability when exposed to thermal stress. Functionalization of the polymer side chains can also be used to engineer the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer. This approach was used by the same group on a PPV derivative by incorporation of a 2-phenylethyl (EtPh) side chain to stiffen the structure. The concept of side chain functionalization was also applied successfully on polythiophenes and advanced donor–acceptor conjugated polymers. The incorporation of alcohol or ester groups as part of the side chains generally resulted in an enhanced thermal stability. A previous study by Peng et al. shows that engineering of the side chains (branching and dimensionality) tuned the thermal stability. Furthermore, Tierney et al. reported on the impact of different types of side chains (linear alkyl, alkoxy, thienyl-alkyl) on the (photochemical) stability and PC61BM diffusion of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole based PSCs. They observed that the solar cell stability decreases in the order of linear alkyl > no > alkoxy > thienyl-alkyl side chains on the BDT unit, directly linked to an elevated rate of PC61BM diffusion due to the dependence on the rotational freedom and steric hindrance induced by the type of side chain. On the level of fullerenes, the PC61BM dimerization, involving a [2 + 2] photo-cycloaddition during light exposure in the absence of oxygen, has been reported as a stabilizing mechanism for PSCs. For different types of fullerenes (C60, PC61BM and bis-PC61BM), it was shown that with an increasing amount of ester groups, the stability increases due to an increased steric hindrance. In a previous work, we investigated the introduction of the 2-phenylethyl group on advanced low bandgap polymers. Introduction of this side chain on two different backbones (based on benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz), respectively), using different amounts of EtPh (5 or 10%, respectively), did not lead to a clear enhancement of the stability and thus improvement of the lifetime of the final PSCs. In the present study, we focus on the influence of the position of the functional side chain, i.e. either on the donor or the acceptor part of the polymer, on the performance and stability of PSCs based on the donor–acceptor copolymer P1 (Fig. 1). This backbone was chosen as a lead candidate (with 2-ethylhexyl and dodecyl side chains (P1-(EH), Fig. 1)) from a large screening of polymers suitable for PSC production via the roll-coating technique. As the choice of the position, nature and length of the side chains has an important influence on the performance of the PSCs,P1, with 2-hexyldecyl and hexyl side chains (Fig. 1), was chosen as the starting point for this study, with efficiencies around 3.7% for RC devices.

All reagents, chemicals and solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. PC61BM (PV-A600) was purchased from Merck Chemicals (RC) and Solenne (spin-coating (SC)), PC71BM from Solenne, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (Orgacon EL-P 5010) from Agfa (RC) and Heraeus Clevios (SC), thermally curable Ag (PV-410) from DuPont, and UV-curable adhesive (Katiobond LP 655) from DELO. Ca and Al were acquired from Alpha Aesar and K. J. Lesker, respectively.


The synthetic routes for the preparation of the monomers are shown in Scheme 1 and S1. Triisopropyl[2-(thiophen-2′-yl)ethoxy]silane (1c), BDT-HD (>99% purity), triisopropyl[2-(thiophen-3′-yl)ethoxy]silane (3b) and BT-hex (>99% purity) were synthesized according to literature procedures with minor modifications.

Preparative (recycling) size exclusion chromatography (recycling SEC) was performed on a JAI LC-9110 NEXT system equipped with JAIGEL 1H, 2H and 3H columns (eluent CHCl3, flow rate 3.5 mL min−1).

1H and 13C NMR spectra (see ESI) were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on a 500 MHz (Bruker) or a 400 MHz (Varian Inova 400) spectrometer.
High-performance liquid chromatography equipped with an evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC/ELSD) was measured to detect the purity of the final monomers prior to polymerization. The analysis was carried out on an e2695 water Alliance system equipped with a 2998 PDA detector and an Agilent Technologies 1260 infinity ELSD. The column was a symmetry C18 3.5 μm, 4.6 mm × 75 mm, solvent A was 0.1% TFA in water and solvent B was 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile; the flow rate was 1 mL min−1.

Synthesis according to the procedure for 1a. Thiophene (1.6 mL, 20 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (20 mL). n-Butyl lithium (n-BuLi) (6.8 mL, 2.5 M in hexane, 17 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C. At room temperature, 2-phenylethyl bromide (2.9 mL, 21 mmol) was added in one go. The reaction mixture was then heated under reflux for 4 h. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel) using hexane as an eluent, affording a transparent liquid (1.2 g, 30%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ (ppm): 3.00 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 3.15 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 6.78 (dd, J = 3.4 Hz, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 6.92 (dd, J = 5.1 Hz, 3.4 Hz, 1H), 7.10 (dd, J = 5.1 Hz, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 7.20–7.32 (m, 5H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 126 MHz) δ (ppm): 31.9, 38.1, 123.1, 124.4, 126.2, 126.7, 128.3, 128.4, 141.2, 144.5.



n-BuLi (1.2 mL, 3.0 mmol, 2.5 M in hexane) was added dropwise at 0 °C to a solution of 1b (565 mg, 3.0 mmol) or 1c (797 mg, 2.8 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL). After the change from a colourless to a darker solution, the mixture was heated for 2 h at 50 °C before adding benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (220 mg, 1.0 mmol), and the mixture was again heated for another hour. Then, SnCl2 (1.5 g, 8.0 mmol) in 12 wt% hydrochloric acid (9 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature before it was finally added to ice water.


The water phase was extracted three times with chloroform and the resulting organic phase was dried over MgSO4. Filtration and removal of the solvent yielded the crude product. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel) using a gradient of petroleum ether and chloroform afforded a yellow solid (249 mg, 44%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ (ppm): 3.11 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 3.25 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 6.91 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 2H), 7.23–7.35 (m, 10H), 7.29 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 2H), 7.46 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 7.63 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 126 MHz) δ (ppm): 32.4, 38.1, 123.5, 124.2, 124.9, 126.4, 127.7, 128.0, 128.6, 128.7, 136.7, 137.5, 139.2, 141.2, 145.9.


The water phase was extracted three times with diethyl ether and the combined organic fractions were dried over MgSO4, filtered and removal of the solvent yielded the crude product. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel) using an eluent mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (1/1) revealed a product mixture (the desired alcohol and the methyl ester analogue). This product mixture was again dissolved in THF (20 mL), NaOH solution (2.5 M in H2O; 10 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight. The organic phase was washed twice with water, dried over MgSO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel) using an eluent mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (4/1) afforded a brown solid of the pure compound 2c (204 mg, 46%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 3.05 (t, J = 6.5 Hz, 4H), 3.73 (td, J = 6.4 Hz, J = 3.7 Hz, 4H), 4.92 (t, J = 3.7 Hz, 2H), 7.08 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 2H), 7.38 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 2H), 7.60 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 7.85 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (DMSO-d6, 101 MHz) δ (ppm): 33.3, 61.7, 122.9, 123.4, 125.9, 128.1, 129.4, 135.9, 136.4, 138.2, 143.6.


To a solution of the non-stannylated compound (2b, c or 3b) in dry THF, n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane) was added at −78 °C and the solution was stirred for 1 h. The temperature was slowly increased to room temperature and the solution was stirred for 20 min to 1 h. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was cooled down to −78 °C again and Me3SnCl (1.0 M in hexane) was added. After the removal of the cooling bath, the mixture was stirred for another 2 h. Water was added, the phases were separated and the organic phase was washed multiple times with water, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.

A green solid precipitated after the addition of n-BuLi, so the temperature was increased right away and the mixture was stirred for 3 h. Purification of the crude product was done by recycling SEC, yielding pure BDT-OH (95 mg, 27%, >99% purity). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 0.40 (s, 18H), 1.70 (t, J = 6.1 Hz, 2H), 3.21 (t, J = 6.1 Hz, 4H), 3.99 (q, J = 6.1 Hz, 4H), 7.04 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 2H), 7.36 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 2H), 7.66 (s, 2H). 13C NMR (DMSO-d6, 75 MHz) δ (ppm): −8.1, 33.8, 63.5, 122.3, 126.1, 128.2, 131.1, 137.5, 139.2, 141.8, 142.8, 143.4.

N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) (41.0 mg, 0.24 mmol) was added to a solution of compound 5b (80.7 mg, 0.12 mmol) in THF (15 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Without further purification, tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) (0.40 g, 1.5 mmol) was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for another 1.5 h. The organic phase was then washed two times with water and dried over MgSO4. After filtration and removal of the solvent, the brown solid was purified using column chromatography (silica gel) with an eluent gradient of dichloromethane and methanol. The product was purified further by recrystallization from acetone, affording a red solid (29.2 mg, 44%, 99% purity). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 2.77 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 4H), 3.67 (td, J = 7.0 Hz, 5.3 Hz, 4H), 4.83 (t, J = 5.3 Hz, 2H), 7.98 (s, 2H), 8.12 (s, 2H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 126 MHz) δ (ppm): 32.9, 60.2, 112.2, 124.2, 125.1, 128.3, 137.6, 140.0, 151.2.


The benzothiadiazole based monomer BT-hex was polymerized following a standard procedure with different ratios of BDT-HD, BDT-Ph and BDT-OH (Table 1), resulting in P1, P2a,b and P3a,b. Polymers P4a,b were synthesized via polymerization of BDT-HD with different ratios of BT-hex and BT-OH. The monomers were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (70 mg mL−1). Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.03 equiv.) and tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.09 equiv.) were then added to the vials before the mixtures were refluxed for at least 20 h. The mixtures were then precipitated into methanol. The solids were filtered and Soxhlet extractions were performed with methanol and hexane. The leftover polymers were dissolved in hot chloroform and finally precipitated once again in methanol, filtered and dried under vacuum. The final polymers were characterized by SEC, 1H NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy.

Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Spectra Series P100 (Spectra Physics) pump equipped with two mixed-B columns (10 μm, 2 cm × 30 cm, Polymer Laboratories) and an Agilent 1100 DAD UV detector at 60 °C. Chlorobenzene was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The molecular weights were determined with UV detection at λmax of the polymer and relative to polystyrene standards.

UV-vis spectra were recorded on an Agilent Technologies Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The spectra were obtained from chloroform solutions and spin-coated films on quartz slides.
Electrochemical experiments were performed with an Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat from Metrohm using the GPES software (version 4.9). The measurements were carried out in a three electrode one compartment microcell at room temperature using a platinum wire working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (0.01 M AgNO3) and 0.1 M NBu4PF6 in anhydrous acetonitrile as the electrolyte. A constant flow of argon allows purging and blanketing of the electrolyte prior to and during analysis. For solid state voltammetry of films, samples were dissolved in chloroform. This solution was applied on the working electrode and dried at room temperature in air. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the products were estimated using the onset potential of the first oxidation-reduction peak in the obtained CV curve. Cyclic voltammograms are not background corrected and characteristic potential values are mean values over several experiments. All potentials are rescaled to ferrocene which is used as an external standard. For the conversion of potentials (V) obtained from the electrochemical measurements to molecular orbital energies (eV), we scale the formal potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple to the vacuum level with a value of −4.98 eV, considering that 0.0 V on the ferrocene scale corresponds to 0.31 V versus SCE (0.55 V versus NHE) and that 0.0 V versus NHE is equivalent to −4.44 eV.
EHOMO/LUMO (eV) = −4.98 − Eonset vs. Ag/AgNO3 (V) + Eonset vs. Ag/AgNO3 (Fc/Fc+) (V).
Alternatively, the LUMO energy levels were calculated as the difference between the HOMO energy and the optical bandgap. To estimate the optical bandgap, the wavelength at the intersection of the tangent line drawn at the low energy side of the absorption spectrum with the x-axis was used in the equation Eg (eV) = 1240/wavelength (nm). The accuracy of measuring redox potentials by CV is about 0.01–0.02 V. Reproducibility can be less because the potentials do not depend on concentration and temperature.
Differential scanning calorimetry was performed on a prototype TA Instruments Rapid-Heat-Cool calorimeter (RHC) using a liquid nitrogen cooling system and purged with helium (12 mL min−1). The RHC cell is heated by four quartz halogen lamps. The samples (∼0.250 mg) were enclosed in dedicated non-hermetical aluminium crucibles.
The photochemical stability of the polymer films prepared by SC on glass slides was analysed using a setup described in the literature.

For the SC devices, the traditional solar cell architecture consisting of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al was employed. Prior to processing, the indium tin oxide (ITO, Kintec, 100 nm, 20 Ohm sq.−1) coated glass substrates were thoroughly cleaned using soap, demineralized water, acetone, isopropanol and a UV/O3 treatment. PEDOT:PSS was subsequently deposited at a thickness of ∼30 nm and annealed at 130 °C for 15 minutes to remove any residual water. Further processing was carried out in a nitrogen containing glovebox (O2/H2O < 1 ppm), starting with the deposition of the PAL layer by spin-coating. For P1, P2a,b, P3a,b and P4a,b, blend solutions with a total concentration of 15 mg mL−1 with a polymer:PC61BM ratio of 1:2 (wt/wt%) were prepared using chloroform (CF) as the processing solvent. A lower total concentration was chosen in comparison to the RC devices to compensate for the faster evaporation rate of CF, yielding a device thickness of around 110 nm. Finally, the devices were finished off by vacuum deposition of the top electrodes, Ca and Al, with layer thicknesses of 30 and 80 nm, respectively. The SC solar cell performance measurements were carried out using a Newport class A solar simulator (model 91195A), calibrated with a silicon solar cell to give an Air Mass (AM) 1.5G spectrum. Stability tests according to ISOS-D-2 standards (under thermal stress) were performed on a hotplate (280 × 200 mm, type PZ28-2ET, Harry Gestigkeit GmbH, with a PR5 programmer controller) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a constant temperature of 85 °C. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured manually at specific time intervals using a Newport class A solar simulator (model 91195A), calibrated with a silicon solar cell to give an AM 1.5G spectrum.

The RC PSCs, with a typical architecture of PET/Ag grid/PEDOT-PSS/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag grid, were produced on a flextrode substrate (produced in house: PET/Ag grid/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO) using a laboratory roll coater under ambient conditions. During the optimization of the RC process for P1, the temperature (60, 70 and 80 °C), the solvent (ODCB, CF, CB/3% CN and ODCB/CB = 4/1), the polymer:PC61BM ratio (1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2 (wt/wt%)) and the elevated layer thickness (390 and 450 nm; to avoid the formation of pinholes during processing) were varied. The material concentration was kept at 40 mg mL−1. PSCs with PALs based on P2a,b were coated from ODCB/CB = 4/1, whereas the active layers based on P3a,b and P4a,b were coated from ODCB/CB = 3/2. Five PSCs per coating were encapsulated between two glass slides using a UV-curable adhesive. The adhesive was activated for a few minutes using a solar simulator. The exact area of all cells was determined using a Light Beam Induced Current (LBIC) technique described in the literature. The RC PSCs were tested under a solar simulator (AM 1.5). I–V curves were recorded to determine the photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a system from PV Measurements Inc. at 10 nm intervals between 300 and 800 nm. A calibrated Si cell was used before the experiment as a reference. Stability tests of the PSCs according to ISOS-L-1 standards (under solar irradiation) were performed using a solar simulator with AM 1.5 (1000 W m−2). The I–V curve tracing of the PSCs was performed using an automated acquisition setup with a Keithley 2400 SMU.

In this study, seven low bandgap copolymers (Fig. 1) based on 4,8-di(thiophene-2′-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT, donor) and 4,7-di(thiophene-2′-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT, acceptor) building blocks were synthesized (Scheme 1).P1 was presented previously bearing a 2-hexyldecyl (HD) and a hexyl side chain on the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively, whereas for P2a,b, the HD side chain was partially (5 or 10%) exchanged by 2-phenylethyl (EtPh) groups, and for P3a,b by 2-hydroxyethyl (EtOH) groups. For P4a,b, the hexyl side chain on the acceptor part was partially (5 or 10%) substituted by EtOH groups.

The required monomers for the polymerizations were synthesized according to the procedures shown in Scheme 1 and S1. The donor monomer BDT-HD was synthesized via a standard three-step protocol starting from thiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDT-dione). After alkylation of thiophene in the 2-position (1a), the molecule was lithiated with n-BuLi at the 5-position, before it was reacted with BDT-dione. Reduction with tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in the hydrochloric acid environment finally yielded DTBDT 2a. Stannylation of 2a using n-BuLi and Me3SnCl afforded BDT-HD. The donor monomer BDT-Ph was synthesized in a similar manner. BDT-OH was also synthesized using the same reaction conditions, but 2-(thiophen-2′-yl)ethanol was used as the starting material. The alcohol group was first protected with a triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) unit (1c). During the third step of the coupling procedure with the BDT-dione, the reduction of the molecule with SnCl2, the TIPS group was removed by the reducing agent, directly yielding the desired alcohol 2c. Stannylation of the obtained product was performed according to the procedure for BDT-HD. However, a larger excess (7 equiv.) of n-BuLi was used to obtain a fully lithiated compound.
The acceptor monomer BT-hex was synthesized via a standard four-step procedure from 3-bromothiophene and 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT-diBr). After alkylation of thiophene in the 3-position (yielding 3a), it was stannylated further in the 2-position (4a) before reacting with BT-diBr. Bromination with NBS then yielded BT-hex. BT-OH was synthesized using similar steps. However, 2-(thiophen-3′-yl)ethanol was used as a starting material. It was again first protected with a TIPS group (3b). Stannylation of 3b and subsequent coupling with BT-diBr yielded compound 5b. After bromination of 5b with NBS, the alcohol was directly deprotected with TBAF yielding monomer BT-OH.
Standard Stille cross-coupling polymerization of the monomers based on BT and BDT yielded P1, P2a,b, P3a,b and P4a,b (Fig. 1). While P1 was obtained as a standard alternating copolymer (based on BDT-HD and BT-hex), the synthesis of P2a,b and P3a,b targeted statistical copolymers with the same backbone, but with partial exchange of the (HD) side chains on the donor moiety using 5 or 10% of BDT-Ph and BDT-OH, respectively. Copolymers P4a and P4b were synthesized using 5 or 10% of BT-OH instead of the regular DTBT acceptor monomer (BT-hex).

The synthesized polymers were characterized using standard techniques. 1H NMR spectra of the polymers were recorded in deuterated chloroform (Fig. S1.16). The spectra of the polymers show the main signals of the polymer backbone as well as of the HD solubilizing side chain. The polymers P2a–P4b show small signals of the ethyl groups of the exchanged side chains (not always clearly visible due to overlapping with the α-CH2 signals of the HD side chains).

The molecular weights (Mn) were measured by SEC to be between 15 and 25 kDa (Table 1).
The optical properties were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of all polymers in chloroform solution (Fig. 2a) showed minor differences. For the entire polymer series, the absorption onset can be found around 736 nm (Table 1). In the wavelength range of the absorption maximum (around 670 nm), the UV-vis curve for P2a,b, P3a and P4a,b flattens out slightly. Only P3b has a similar curve progression as the parent copolymer P1. The absorption spectra of the polymer films (Fig. 2b) show two maxima between 600 and 700 nm, with onset wavelengths varying slightly (in the range of 10 nm, Table 1). However, the maximum around 700 nm is most defined for P1, whereas for the altered copolymers, the intensities are more equivalent or even a more elevated maximum around 630 nm is observed. The optical bandgaps were all estimated at approximately 1.66 eV.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers (Table 1). The electrochemical bandgap was calculated to be 1.85 eV for P1. Alteration of the side chains resulted in slightly increased values for the bandgap (e.g. 1.90 eV for P4a,b), with the exception of P3b, showing a lower bandgap of 1.82 eV. P3b has the highest HOMO level of −5.20 eV. The HOMO levels of the other copolymers are similar to the value obtained for the parent copolymer P1 (around −5.28 eV). The LUMO levels of the modified polymers increased slightly relative to P1. A comparison between the different side chain modifications on the acceptor and donor moieties shows that the HOMO shifts to a lower value for the acceptor modification.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2) showed different thermal stabilities for the polymers with and without manipulated side chains. The decomposition of all copolymers starts around 400 °C. The small temperature differences between all samples could be due to the different side chains or slightly different molecular weights. The thermal properties of the polymers were finally also investigated by rapid-heat cooling calorimetry (RHC) (Fig. S3). This method was chosen instead of regular differential scanning calorimetry due to the low sample amounts required and the increased sensitivity to thermal transitions (e.g. Tg). RHC analysis reveals that all materials are amorphous. A broad Tg is detectable for all polymers in the range of 135 to 150 °C.

The novel polymers were applied in BHJ PSCs via both RC and SC techniques. The influence of the two different side chains (EtOH and EtPh) as well as the influence of the side chain modification on either the acceptor or donor moiety (using EtOH) was investigated in terms of photovoltaic performance and stability (under solar irradiance and thermal stress). The SC devices had a traditional architecture glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al with a PAL area of 3 mm2. The PSC architecture for the RC devices consisted of PET/Ag grid/PEDOT:PSS/ZnO/polymer:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag grid, with device areas of ∼1 cm2.

For the SC BHJ PSCs, a small solvent screening (ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and CF) was performed (Table S1) for P1, based on the conditions used for the RC processing of the PSCs made from P1-(EH). CF was determined to be the most optimal solvent, with a polymer:PC61BM ratio of 1:2 and a total concentration of 15 mg mL−1, warranting layer thicknesses of around 110 nm. The reduced blend concentration was chosen due to the more rapid evaporation of CF in comparison with ODCB. The use of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester did not increase the performance of the produced PSCs.
The RC process of the PSCs based on P1 was additionally optimized by a variation in the temperature (60, 70 and 80 °C), solvent (ODCB, CF, chlorobenzene (CB)/3% 2-chloronaphthalene (CN) and ODCB/CB = 4/1), polymer:PC61BM ratio (1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2) and PAL thickness (390 and 450 nm). The results (Table S2) revealed the highest values for the photovoltaic parameters when utilizing a polymer:PC61BM ratio of 1:2 (40 mg mL−1) and coating from ODCB/CB (4/1) at 80 °C with a PAL thickness of 450 nm. For consistency, these parameters were maintained for the RC processing of the copolymer PSCs (P2a,b, P3a, P4a). Since the properties of the photoactive films produced from the P3 and P4 analogues were rather poor in comparison to the P1 film (Table S3), the cosolvent ratio changed to ODCB/CB = 3/2 to obtain improved film morphology and performance characteristics (Table S4).
The solar cell characteristics are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S4. The SC devices were found to be better than the RC PSCs, in terms of Voc (∼0.75 vs. ∼0.72 V) Jsc (∼10 vs. ∼8 mA cm−2) and FF (∼0.67 vs. ∼0.60). As such, PCEs of around 4–5% could be achieved for the SC devices (Table 2). The devices based on the reference material P1 exerted an averaged PCE of 4.50%. A slight elevation of the performance could be achieved for copolymer P3a (4.89%), whereas P4b showed a lower performance, with averaged PCE values of 4.34%. The solar cell characteristics for the RC devices revealed an averaged PCE of 3.43% for P1, and the partial side chain substitutions have negligible effects on the performance. A strong reduction in PCE was, similar to the SC processing, obtained for P4b, demonstrating a PCE of 3.04%. Overall, the Jsc and Voc are similar for the entire (co)polymer series, and the slight variation in performance can be traced back to (rather) small differences in FF (0.60 for P1vs. ∼0.55 for P4a and P4b). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs (with highest efficiency) do not show any particular features and only minor vertical shifts can be observed (Fig. S5).

In general, both the RC and SC device series demonstrate a (small) negative influence of the modification of the acceptor side chain on the performance of the resulting PSCs, especially when increasing the modification ratio (as observed in the case of P4b).
On the other hand, functionalization of the side chains on the donor moiety can result in slight improvements in PCE, although in this case observed only within the SC device series.

The thermal stability of the SC solar cells was investigated according to ISOS-D-2 standard conditions by placing the devices on a hotplate at 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere and measuring the I–V characteristics on a regular timescale. As illustrated by the relative PCE decays in Fig. 3a (absolute PCEs in Fig. S6a), all solar cell devices behave similarly for the duration of the heat treatment (450 h), with PCEs decreasing to 60–70% of their initial values.

Deconvolution into the separate I–V parameters shows only a minor decay in relative Voc (to 85–90%) (Fig. S6b). Similarly, the Jsc also stays relatively stable over the entire experiment, with values approximating 70% after 450 h (Fig. S6c). The main differences in relative PCE among the different PSCs originate from differences in FF behaviour (Fig. S6d), for which small morphological rearrangements or minor electrode improvements induce a slight improvement at the start of the experiment. A similar degradation curvature for all PAL materials can partially be rationalized by the chosen degradation temperature (85 °C), which is far below the Tg of all copolymers (135 to 150 °C), as such that the crystallization and phase separation of PC61BM, a known thermal degradation pathway, will not readily occur.

The photochemical stability of the (co)polymer materials was investigated by measuring their absorption in a thin film under illumination at AM 1.5 (1000 W m−2) using an automated setup as described in the literature. The polymer films, spin coated on glass substrates, were directly exposed to solar irradiation. The degradation rates (Table 2) could be determined from the corresponding absorption (maximum) decay curves (Fig. 3b). P1, P2a,b and P4a degraded with a similar rate (∼1.15%/hour), whereas the degradation rate for P4b increased to 1.46%/hour. However, the manipulation of the side chain on the donor part of the polymers using EtOH resulted in both cases in a slightly higher stability. While P3a had a degradation rate of 1.04%/hour, it decreased even further to 0.83%/hour for P3b. Detailed analysis of the curve slope reveals that the improved stability is already visible after ∼10 hours, whereas the slope for P4b starts to decrease at a stronger rate around this time. All samples were fully bleached at the end of the stability test. No absorption could be detected anymore after ∼23 hours for P4b, 27–31 hours for P1, P2a,b, P3a and P4a, and ∼37 hours for P3b.

The incorporation of the different side chains on different positions of the (co)polymers thus clearly results in different photochemical stabilities of the polymers. Incorporation of the EtPh side chains shows no noteworthy effect on the photochemical stability, with degradation curves following a very similar pathway as the reference material P1. Substitution of 5% of the side chains by EtOH moieties on the acceptor building block also reveals no added value. In fact, a negative trend could be observed with 10% incorporation of the EtOH group for P4b. However, incorporation of the EtOH side chain onto the donor moiety revealed a slower photochemical degradation, most pronounced in the case of 10% substitution. In this case, the new side chain is not directly attached on the conjugated polymer backbone, but on the thiophene side chain of the BDT building block.
Any chemical reaction within the active layer can contribute to the degradation of the active layer. Multiple degradation mechanisms for polymers in PSCs subdued to solar irradiance in an ambient (oxygen) environment have been described in the literature. Light as a main trigger for the degradation of conjugated polymers has been shown to result in photobleaching (disruption of conjugation), photooxidation (disruption of the conjugation/side chain removal), free radical attack/photolysis (chain scission/cross linking/side chain removal) and photodoping (weakly bound donor–acceptor charge transfer complex, reversible). In 1993 Abdou and Holdcroft demonstrated the formation of singlet oxygen by photobleaching, which then reacts with the thiophene in the polymer backbone through a Diels–Alder addition, leading to the disruption of the π-conjugation. In a second and third process, a free radical pathway occurs, resulting in either chain scission or cleavage of the side chain. Photooxidation of conjugated polymers grants oxygen-containing polymers with ruptures of the aromatic system and formation of a R–SOx species at the thiophene part. Radical oxidation of the hexyl side chain on P3HT and subsequent stepwise oxidation of the sulfur atom of thiophene have been shown to lead to the loss of the π-conjugation and therefore results in bleaching of the polymer material. Since for P4a and P4b the EtOH side chain is anchored onto the thiophene rings of the acceptor unit, part of the π-conjugated backbone, this degradation pathway may induce a more rapid degradation in comparison with the other (co)polymers. However, it is difficult to specify clearly the degradation mechanisms occurring within these polymer series, especially for P3b and P4b, respectively, addressing how the incorporation of different side chains influenced these degradation mechanisms.
In addition, reversible p-doping of the polymer by oxygen can take place. Slow physical adsorption of oxygen on the polymer chain forms a weak charge-transfer complex and this process is accelerated by light exposure. Different studies show that the PV performance of conjugated polymers is dependent on the molecular weight. Photoinduced oxidation, chain scission and opening of the π-conjugated system can result in a variation of the polymer chain length and therefore affects the optical and photovoltaic properties of the degraded polymers. In conclusion, all described mechanisms may occur in the polymer films during exposure to light, but it was not specifically investigated as how the polymers degrade under this external stress.

The RC PSCs were then analysed in ISOS-L-1 lifetime tests, in which three cells of each polymer were subdued to AM 1.5 (1000 W m−2) illumination for 50 days. At the start of the measurements, I–V curves were recorded every couple of minutes, and this was prolonged to 30 minutes at later timescales. The averaged and absolute PV parameters of the three cells were plotted against time (Fig. 4 and S7). During the initial phase (0–5 hours/“burn-in” phase) of the lifetime study, the PCE decreased relatively fast for all cells, from >3% to <2.5% for P1, P2a,b, P3a,b and P4a, except for the cells from P4b, which decreased from a PCE of 2.7% to ∼2.0% (Fig. S7a). In normalized terms (Fig. 4a), analysis of the device data after 5 hours for the reference material P1 revealed a decay to 70% of the initial value, whereas the devices based on copolymers P3a,b and P4a,b retained a relative performance of between 72% and 74% for the 5% and 10% functionalization, respectively. Copolymers P2a and P2b demonstrated relative PCEs of 65 and 70%, respectively, after 5 hours (Fig. 4a), retaining the trend within the side chain ratio, but performing worse than the reference material. After 5 days under constant sun irradiation, the PSCs based on P1 and P3b showed a PCE of ∼1.9%, while the efficiency of the devices based on P4b decreased to 1.4%. The PSCs based on P3b still demonstrated a PCE of 60% of the initial value, while the solar cells made from P2a and P4b decreased more strongly (to 50% of the initial PCE). The relative efficiencies for the PSCs based on P1, P2b, P3a and P4a were in between these two values (∼55% of the initial value).

During the final stage of the measurements, the efficiencies decreased in a quite linear manner with different slopes for the different polymers. After 50 days under constant sun irradiation, the PSCs based on P3b and P4b performed at 24% and 26% of their initial PCE, respectively, while the efficiency of the devices made from P1, P2a, P3a and P4a decreased to ∼22% of the initial value. The efficiency of the PSCs based on P2b decreased the least, to 30% of the initial value.
From the photostability measurements on RC devices, it can thus be concluded that 5% exchange of the side chains by functional moieties does not result in improved device stabilities. The substitution of 10% (P2b, P3b and P4b) of the side chains does result in a small increase of the stability of the PSCs, measurable for both side chains studied here and applied in different positions.
The other I–V characteristics (Voc, Jsc, FF) showed a similar trend. The negative influence (with respect to PCE) of the substituted EtOH side chain on the acceptor part in P4b is also reflected in a faster decrease of the Jsc and FF during the first stage. This decrease could not be compensated during the progression of the experiment. Surprisingly, the PSCs based on this polymer retained a higher Voc, even after solar irradiation for 50 days. On the other hand, the beneficial influence of the EtPh side chain in P2b is seen for all three characteristics during the stability test. These PSCs have the highest retained values for Voc, Jsc and FF (0.62 V, 3.5 mA cm−2 and 45%). The reference polymer device parameters are in the centre span. The FF of P3b is also more stable than the FF of the reference P1 device (75% of the initial value).

The influence of the introduction of stabilizing side chains was studied by Friend et al. and Vanderzande et al., previously and adopted herein to improve the photo- and thermal stability. In particular, the influence on the thermal stability and phase separation of the active layer was part of the beginning of the study, as the (photochemical) stability of a polymer:fullerene BHJ can also be governed by PCBM crystallization and dimerization. The PCBM dimerization is probably also part of the rather complicated degradation pathway occurring here, but is not specifically investigated in this study. Due to undetectable Tg and no difference within the thermal degradation test (first section in 3.3) of the PSCs, the stability discussion in this study moves from an influence on the thermal to an influence on the photochemical stability of the polymer and PSC, respectively. So the thermal stability and the related PCBM crystallization was not explored further in this study.

It has been shown before, that the polymer structure (nature of the backbone, amount and length of the side chains) can influence the (photochemical) stability of the polymers and thus of the resulting polymer solar cells. Manceau et al. showed that different donor or acceptor groups within the backbone structure changes the photochemical stability of the resulting polymer. As a result they proposed some general rules for the structure-stability ranking of donor–acceptor polymers for PSCs. Very recently, the group of Andersson reported a copolymer series combining a quinoxaline acceptor unit with differently substituted BDT or unsubstituted thienothiophene units, investigating the effect of structural modifications on the polymer film and the corresponding PSC stability. Similar to our observations, their results demonstrate a different trend among the photochemical stability of the neat polymer films and the corresponding solar cells. In the current contribution, comparison of the photostability analysis of the PSCs reveals that the location of the functional side chains, either on the donor or acceptor building block, influences the stability of the resulting materials and devices. For both light-induced degradation tests, P4b, with exchanged side chains on the acceptor part, shows the most rapid degradation. On the other hand, when applying the same strategy on the BDT donor building block (P2b and P3b, bearing EtPh and EtOH, respectively), slight improvements in stability can be noted. On the material level, EtOH incorporation already granted more stable materials at 5% incorporation ratio, whereas 10% was required on the device level. Even though 10% EtPh incorporation showed a minor effect on the photochemical degradation, improved solar cell stability could be achieved. The thermal degradation of the SC PSCs proceeded similar for all devices containing different polymers.

In this work, a reference donor–acceptor polymer P1 based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and dithienylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) was successfully adapted through partial exchange (5 or 10%) of the solubilizing side chains (hexyldecyl (HD) on the donor or hexyl on the acceptor part), as a means to investigate to which extent the functionalized side chains can lead to improved polymer solar cell stability. The incorporation of the functional moieties 2-phenylethyl (EtPh) and 2-hydroxyethyl (EtOH) resulted in statistical copolymers P2a (5% EtPh for HD), P2b (10% EtPh for HD), P3a (5% EtOH for HD), P3b (10% EtOH for HD), P4a (5% EtOH for hexyl) and P4b (10% EtOH for hexyl).

All polymers were investigated in bulk heterojunction solar cells, prepared by both spin-coating and roll-coating, with maximum PCEs up to 5.0% and 3.4%, respectively. For roll-coating, the best performance was obtained from PSCs based on P1, whereas P3b was found to be superior in performance when the photoactive layer was spin-coated. The photovoltaic efficiency suffered the most upon substitution of the side chain pattern on the acceptor unit (P4a,b).
Degradation tests (thermal and photochemical) were performed on the PSCs. When treated at 85 °C for 450 hours, the spin-coated PSCs based on all (co)polymers showed very similar features, without distinguishable differences. Since this standardized degradation temperature lies far below the Tg of the polymers, no phase separation/crystallization of the PC61BM acceptor is to be expected.
Photochemical stability measurements on both roll-coated devices and (co)polymer films also revealed small fluctuations. For all copolymers, 5% side chain substitution has barely any impact. Furthermore, incorporation of 10% of the EtOH side chain on the acceptor moiety (P4b) resulted in a more rapid deterioration of the material. However, in comparison with the reference material P1, an improvement of the stability of the PSCs could be obtained when incorporating 10% of EtPh or EtOH on the side chains of the donor building block (P2b, P3b).
These results show that 10% side chain substitution can already slightly improve the stability of the polymer films and the resulting PSCs. Thus, it is clearly shown that the variation of side chains, especially at different positions (acceptor or donor unit of the polymer), has an influence on the stability. To find the ideal side chains and positions for polymers suitable for roll coating, it is necessary to perform some further screening.
