The all-inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell (PSC) has received tremendous attention due to its favorable photoelectric properties and superior stability against moisture and heat attack. Nevertheless, the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbIBr2 PSC is still far from its counterparts, mainly because of the inferior film crystallization and morphology of the CsPbIBr2 light-absorbing layer, along with much trap defects and severe charge recombination. Herein, all-inorganic perovskite CsPbIBr2 is doped with ZnBr2 to improve crystallinity and morphology, optimize energy level alignment and enhance photovoltaic performance of PSC. Consequently, with the optimized concentration of Zn2+ (1%, at.), CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2-based PSC shows the highest PCE of 10.51%, which is 34% higher than that of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs (7.84%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2-based device exhibits superior long-term stability in ambient atmosphere and against heat. This study provides a feasible strategy for preparing a high quality perovskite film and improving the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of CsPbIBr2 PSCs, aiming at promoting the potential applications of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs.

In the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites have aroused unprecedented attention as emerging photovoltaic materials due to their excellent photoelectric properties. Furthermore the highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of conventional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed from 3.8% to 25.5%, showing great application potential in the field of photovoltaics. However, due to the presence of volatile organic components such as methylammonium (MA) and formamidnium (FA), traditional organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs always suffer from poor moisture and thermal stability, which severely limits their commercial utility. Therefore, inorganic cesium ions (Cs+) were selected to replace organic cations to prepare all-inorganic PSCs for addressing the stability issue. The interaction between cations and the inorganic [PbX6]4− frameworks can be enhanced by using Cs+ instead of organic cations, thus further delaying the degradation process.

At present, the studied all-inorganic perovskites mainly focused on CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2, and CsPbBr3. Among them, CsPbI3 with a narrow bandgap (∼1.69 eV) has achieved a superior PCE of 19.03%. However, severe phase instability exists in CsPbI3 because the α-CsPbI3 phase structure can only be stable above 330 °C, leading to its rapid conversion to the nonphotoactive phase (δ-CsPbI3) at room temperature even under encapsulated conditions. In contrast, CsPbBr3 has a very stable phase structure but a wide bandgap (∼2.35 eV), which greatly restricts its light harvesting capability in the visible region, directly resulting in a low photocurrent and thus a limited PCE. Then, mixed halide all-inorganic perovskites CsPbI3−xBrx can adjust the light absorption capacity and structural stability by changing the ratio of the halide anions. Brown CsPbI2Br has drawn attention due to its favorable bandgap and slightly improved phase stability, but it remains structurally unstable and is easily converted into unwanted δ-CsPbI2Br in ambient atmosphere. Fortunately, CsPbIBr2 with a further increased Br amount in the perovskite exhibits a more balanced bandgap (∼2.05 eV) and better phase stability, rendering it as an exceptional alternative for the fabrication of PSCs. Nevertheless, the current PCEs of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs still largely lag behind those of all-inorganic CsPbI3 and CsPbI2Br-based PSCs as well as the conventional organic–inorganic PSCs. This dilemma mainly ascribes to the inferior quality of the CsPbI2Br films, in which lots of grain boundaries and compositional defects are inevitable from being produced during the typical solution process. It is acknowledged that the numerous grain boundaries and pinholes will impede the charge carrier transport and cause undesirable charge recombination, further lowering the whole device performance.
In order to fabricate high-quality CsPbIBr2 perovskite films, various strategies have been implemented such as interface modification, ion substitution, intermolecular exchange, and optimizing the substrate-preheating temperature. In comparison, ion substitution is a simple but effective way to fabricate high-quality CsPbIBr2 perovskite films for controlling crystallization, releasing lattice strain, and passivating defects. Tan et al. used a smaller positive monovalent alkali metal ion Li+ to substitute the Cs-site to improve the crystallinity and morphology, and obtained a PCE of 9.25% of the CsPbIBr2 PSC. The substitution of the Pb-site has also been investigated by several research groups. For instance, Mn2+ and Cu2+ doped into CsPbIBr2 have been certified to reduce defect density and charge recombination of the perovskite films in comparison with their undoped counterparts, thus improving the PCE and long-term stability of PSCs. Liang et al. fabricated the CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2 films via a two-step sequential deposition and the device achieved a high PCE of 11.33% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.26 V. Subsequently, Li et al. further increased the content of Sn2+, and the corresponding CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2 was prepared using a general one-step antisolvent method, and obtained a superior PSC performance. However, Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+ under air conditions, which is a huge ordeal for the long-term stability of Sn2+ doped devices. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a facile and effective approach for the preparation of large-grained CsPbIBr2 films with few crystal boundaries and trap defects, aiming to achieve high performance CsPbIBr2-based PSCs with satisfactory efficiency and stability simultaneously.
Herein, we incorporated ZnBr2 into a CsPbIBr2 perovskite precursor and prepared the CsPb1−xZnxIBr2 perovskite films using a facile one-step spin-coating method. Zn2+ doping could adjust the crystallization of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film and ameliorate the interior morphology, which benefits to suppress charge recombination and reduce trap states. Moreover, the doping of Zn2+ could commendably regulate the energy band level of CsPbIBr2, which improved the built-in potential and VOC of CsPbIBr2 PSCs. As a result, the optimized CsPbIBr2 perovskite film doped with 1% Zn2+ presented the most homogeneous and densely crystallized morphology along with the best optoelectronic properties. Consequently, the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2-based PSC achieved a champion PCE of 10.51% with a remarkable VOC of 1.28 V. Additionally, the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSCs without encapsulation retained 92% of their initial PCE values after 30 days of aging in air, and 81% of their initial PCE values after heating in nitrogen (N2) for more than 400 hours at 85 °C.

All materials and reagents were used as received without any purification: cesium iodide (CsI, 99.9%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.9%, Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), zinc bromide(ZnBr2, 99.9%, Aladdin), 2′2,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amine]-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, 99.9%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%, anhydrous), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.9%, Aladdin), and isopropanol (IPA, 99.9%, Aladdin).


Firstly, FTO glass substrates were etched using Zn powder and 1.5 M HCl for expected patterns. The patterned FTO glass substrates were successively cleaned ultrasonically with deionized water, ethanol and acetone for 15 min and dried in nitrogen flow. Then, the dry substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 15 min before use. Subsequently, a homogeneous compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer (0.5 mol isopropyl titanate and 0.5 mol ethylene glycol amine dissolved in 1 mL IPA) was coated on the substrate. Then it was annealed in the air at 450 °C for 1 hour. After this, the c-TiO2 substrate was immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. Finally, the treated c-TiO2 substrate was cleaned with ethanol and annealed once in the air at 500 °C for 1 hour.

After annealing, the device was transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. The perovskite layer was obtained by spin-coating the 1 M CsPbIBr2 precursor (260 mg of CsI and 367 mg of PbBr2 were completely dissolved in 1 mL DMSO and stirred at 70 °C for 15 min.) on top of the c-TiO2 substrate at 1000 rpm for 5 s and then 2500 rpm for 30 s. For Zn2+ doped CsPbIBr2, precursors were prepared by x% (x = 0.5, 1, 2) mol ZnBr2 substituting the same molar ratio of PbBr2, maintaining the I/Br ratio unchanged. The operation of the Zn2+ doped CsPbIBr2 layer is the same as the one mentioned above. Then it is annealed at 250 °C step by step.
For the HTM layer, 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD was absolutely dissolved in 1 mL CB, and then 28.5 μL of 4-tBP and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) were added into the Spiro-OMeTAD solution. The HTL was obtained by spin-coating Spiro-OMeTAD solution on top of the perovskite layers at 3000 rpm for 30 s.
Finally, approximately 80 nm thick silver electrodes were thermally evaporated by high vacuum thermal evaporation deposition onto the HTL. The active area of the device in this work was 0.07 cm2.

X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance instrument with Cu Kα X-ray radiation) were used to test the crystal structure and diffraction angle range from 5° to 50°. The surface and cross-section morphology were observed using a Hitachi SU-70 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was measured with the same instrument for element content and distribution.

The chemical states of ions were tested by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD) using Al Kα as radiation and the C 1s line at 284.6 eV was used for correction for all the spectra. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) patterns were also measured using the Kratos Axis Ultra DLD instrument, and using the He I (21.22 eV) emission line. The surface morphology and potential of the perovskite films were tested by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Asylum Research Cypher, UK) and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM, Asylum Research Cypher, UK), respectively.
The steady-state fluorescence spectra (PL) were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent, USA), with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. The time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured using a PL spectrometer (Horiba, Japan) excited with a 470 nm pulsed laser. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using an IR spectrometer instrument (Thermo, Nicolet 6700).
The J–V characteristic curves were tested using the Keithley 4200 meter and the sunlight simulator (Newport, 91192A, AM 1.5, 1 Sun), which was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell. All J–V curves were scanned at a rate of 100 mV s−1 from −0.1 V to 1.4 V or vice versa. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements and dark J−V curves were measured using the Keithley 4200 meter under dark conditions. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was tested using a Newport EQE system and wavelength range from 300 to 700 nm. The transient photo-current (TPC) decay, transient photo-voltage (TPV) decay and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were measured by an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) under dark conditions.

Previous studies have reported that zinc compound doping is an effective approach for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable hybrid perovskite devices. Inspired by this, we have also successfully introduced an appropriate amount of Zn2+ into CsPbIBr2. To explore the influence of Zn2+ on CsPbIBr2 perovskite film, lead bromide (PbBr2) was partly substituted by zinc bromide (ZnBr2) as the starting material, various amounts of ZnBr2 (0, 0.5%, 1% and 2%, molar ratio) were doped into CsPbIBr2 precursor solutions while maintaining an unchanged I/Br ratio, and the specific details are described in the Experimental Section. As shown in Fig. 1a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these perovskite films present several main peaks at 15.39° and 30.63°, corresponding to the (100) and (200) crystal planes of α-phase CsPbIBr2 perovskite, respectively. No impurity phase is observed in the as-prepared films, indicating that the formation of impurity phase is inhibited in the crystallization process of the Zn2+ doped perovskite films. Fig. 1b shows that there is a small gradual shift of the (100) and (200) characteristic peaks toward a higher 2Theta value, which is attributed to the shrinkage of the perovskite lattice in CsPbIBr2 along with the increase in Zn2+ content. After doping with 1% Zn2+, the main peak intensity of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 shows the maximum, indicating that the crystallinity has been enhanced, which is beneficial for harvesting more sunlight to increase the photocurrent. To identify the chemical compositions and states of CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed. Fig. S1a (ESI) presents the XPS survey spectrum of the corresponding pristine CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2. The core spectrum of Zn 2p was also detected in the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 layer, which also confirmed the reasonable incorporation of Zn2+ into the perovskite film (Fig. S1b). Fig. S1c–f (ESI) show the corresponding Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d and Br 3d core spectra. Compared with CsPbIBr2, the peaks of each element in the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 film shift slightly towards the direction of lower binding energy, indicating the change in the chemical environment of the perovskite film. There is no doubt that the change in the chemical environment is related to the change of the perovskite lattice due to the successful partial substitution of Pb2+ by Zn2+. To be specific, the BX6 (B = Pb2+ or Zn2+, X = Br− and I−) octahedral shrinkage caused by the replacement of Pb2+ with Zn2+ leads to a more stable phase of the perovskite film and reflects in the shift of the XPS peaks for all elements. The result is in good accordance with the abovementioned XRD results as well.

The influence of Zn2+ doping on the photophysical properties was then measured for various CsPbIBr2 perovskite films upon different doping amounts of Zn2+. As shown in Fig. 1c, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra onset of all samples is about 607 nm, and there is an imperceptible redshift with the increase in Zn2+ content. Moreover, it can be seen that the absorption intensity in the 350–600 nm range is significantly enhanced after Zn2+ doping, which is indicative of better light absorption capability of the perovskite film. Fig. S2 (ESI) shows the Tauc plots of CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.1IBr2 films obtained from the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra using the equation (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg). From the Tauc plots, it is clear that synchronous shifts with UV-vis absorption were also clearly observed, suggesting that the narrower band gap of the perovskite (2.05 eV of CsPbIBr2 and 2.04 eV of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2) were obtained due to effective Zn2+ doping. Fig. 1d illustrates the steady-state PL of CsPbIBr2 films with different Zn2+ doping amounts on a non-conductive glass substrate. We found that the PL peaks of all doped perovskite films were slightly redshifted. The PL peak of CsPbIBr2 was at 600 nm, while the PL peak of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 was at 602 nm, which also well matched the result of UV-vis absorption. Strikingly, the strongest PL intensity suggests that the nonradiative recombination is significantly suppressed within the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 perovskite film, deriving from the perovskite layer with higher crystal quality and fewer defects after effective doping.
Considering that the morphology of perovskite has a great influence on device performance, we investigated the effect of Zn2+ doping on the surface morphology of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite films including coverage, uniformity and grain size, which are considered as the key factors to achieve high-performance PSCs.Fig. 2a–d show the field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) surface morphology images of both the pristine and Zn2+ doping CsPbIBr2 films. Grain-size statistical distribution based on SEM is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI). It is obvious that the pure CsPbIBr2 film has lots of pinholes and exhibits a small grain size of about 474 nm. The rapid crystallization rate of CsI and PbBr2 is the main reason for the many pinholes in pure CsPbIBr2 films. Although the coordination between PbBr2 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form the PbBr2–DMSO intermediate compound can retard the crystallization of the CsPbIBr2 film to some extent, it cannot completely eliminate the pinholes. This relatively low coverage leads to the direct contact of the electron transport layer (ETL) with the hole transport layer (HTL) and consequentially to substantial recombination. It is noted that an obvious morphological change can be observed after Zn2+ incorporation. After doping 0.5% Zn2+ (CsPb0.995Zn0.005IBr2), the pinholes are significantly reduced, and the grain sizes get larger (about 728 nm). On further increasing the Zn2+ doping to 1% (CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2), the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 perovskite film exhibits enlarged grain size (average 961 nm) along with fewer boundaries, and achieves conformal and compact film coverage. The previous reports demonstrated that the chemical activity of Zn is stronger than that of Pb, which is more prone to interact with Cs, I, and Br. We speculate that the presence of Zn could make the binding of Cs, Pb, I and Br slow and greatly retard the crystallization rate of perovskite due to the successful coordination of DMSO onto ZnBr2, which was confirmed by the stretching vibration of SO (ν(SO)) appearing at about 1027 cm−1 in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S4, ESI). Therefore, it is beneficial to obtain a high-quality CsPbIBr2 film with improved morphology owing to the proper incorporation of Zn2+ (Fig. 2c). However, when further increasing Zn2+ doping to 2% (CsPb0.98Zn0.02IBr2), the pinholes reappear, which means that excessive Zn2+ doping could impede the perovskite crystal growth and result in low crystallinity films with reduced coverage. To investigate the influence of higher concentration of Zn2+ doping on perovskite films, the CsPb0.9Zn0.1IBr2 perovskite film with 10% high concentration of Zn2+ was prepared. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI), the quality of perovskite film is extremely poor with numerous pinholes. Indeed, appropriate doping concentration can optimize the morphology of the perovskite film, but excessive doping concentration will destroy the morphology and the crystallinity of the perovskite film. In order to confirm the presence of Zn2+ and observe its distribution in perovskite films, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was conducted. As demonstrated in Fig. 2e, elements such as Cs, Pb, I, Br and Zn are distributed evenly over the whole perovskite film, which indicates that Zn2+ is uniformly doped in the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 film.

Fig. 3a shows the atomic force microscope (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) images of CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.98Zn0.02IBr2 films. The pristine CsPbIBr2 perovskite layer grown on compact TiO2 displays many exposed regions. In contrast, the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 perovskite film has a better coverage and larger crystal grain size. The results are in accordance with the SEM surface morphology. Specifically, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is dramatically decreased from 41.80 to 20.45 nm, indicating that Zn2+ atoms incorporated in CsPbIBr2 can influence the nucleation in the precursor solutions and benefit the crystallization processes. The smoother surface of the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 film is beneficial for the contact between the perovskite and the HTL layer. KPFM is utilized to probe the potential of the perovskite surface. The work function (φ) of the perovskite film can be deduced by the formula: e(V1 − V2) = φ2 − φ1, where V1 and V2 are the surface potential of the CsPbIBr2 film and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 film, and φ1 and φ2 are their corresponding work functions, respectively. The higher the surface potential, the stronger the built-in electric field in the perovskite films, which is conducive to the extraction and separation of charge and the transmission of carriers. Fig. 3b shows the corresponding surface potential increasing from 684 to 764 mV after Zn2+ doping, indicating that the work function of the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 perovskite is 0.08 eV smaller than that of CsPbIBr2. The reduction of the work function of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 indicates the rapid dissociation and transfer of photon-generated carriers as well as efficient suppression of electron–hole recombination in the photovoltaic device.
The energy level matching between different functional layers is of importance for effective charge transfer and suppressed recombination. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was performed to further investigate the effect of Zn2+ doping on the electronic structure. Fig. 3c presents the UPS spectra of secondary electron cutoff energy (Ecutoff) and valence band maximum onset energy (Eonset) of the perovskite films, respectively. As can be drawn from Fig. 3c, the Ecutoff of CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 are 17.44 eV and 17.52 eV, respectively. And the corresponding work function can be also derived to 3.78 and 3.70 eV, respectively, which indicates that the work function of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 is 0.08 eV smaller than that of CsPbIBr2, similar to the KPFM result mentioned above. In addition, the valence band maximum energy (EVBM) and the conduction band minimum energy (ECBM) were calculated. Thus, the calculated EVBM values for CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 are about −5.71 and −5.62 eV, respectively. Furthermore, combining with the bandgap of CsPbIBr2 (2.05 eV) and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 (2.04 eV) derived from the previous Tauc plot, ECBM values for CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 are estimated to be −3.66 and −3.58 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the energy level diagram of the CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 films as well as the other functional layer is displayed in Fig. 3d. Clearly, the EVBM difference of the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2/Spiro-OMeTAD heterojunction is smaller than that of CsPbIBr2, which means that the energy loss of the hole transfer from the valence band of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 films to Spiro-OMeTAD is reduced as well. The definite shift of energy level to vacuum of the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 thin film is mainly related to the contraction of the perovskite lattice caused by the doping of Zn2+, and the result is consistent with the XPS results mentioned above. The change of energy level proves that the addition of Zn2+ is a promising strategy to modulate the band structure for matching energy bands.
In order to explore the effect of Zn2+ doping on the photovoltaic performance, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/c-TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag planar heterojunction PSCs were fabricated, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image reveals a uniform stack of functional layers, as diagrammed in Fig. 4b. The ultimate PSCs are tested under AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in both reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS) directions. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve under RS and the corresponding data parameters are shown in Fig. 4c and Table 1, respectively. Obviously, the PCE performance of Zn-doped PSCs are superior than that of pure CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The device with pure CsPbIBr2 delivered a decent PCE of 7.84%, VOC of 1.22 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 10.21 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.63. After doping 0.5% Zn2+, the CsPb0.995Zn0.005IBr2-based PSC attained a better PCE of 9.50%, and the VOC, JSC and FF values were all increased compared with those of CsPbIBr2. Furthermore, the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC achieved the champion PCE of 10.51%, corresponding to the highest VOC, JSC and FF of 1.28 V, 11.92 mA cm−2 and 0.69, respectively. As summarized in Table 2, we achieved the highest VOC and an excellent efficiency among the CsPbIBr2-based PSCs with different ion substitutions. However, after doping 2% Zn2+, CsPb0.98Zn0.02IBr2 PSC just obtained a PCE of 9.25%, which was worse than that of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2, and the corresponding VOC, JSC and FF also decreased. Moreover, by increasing the concentration of Zn2+ to 10%, the photovoltaic properties of the CsPb0.9Zn0.1IBr2 perovskite were significantly reduced, with an efficiency of only 2.21% (Fig. S6, ESI). By comparison, it is found that the efficiency of the optimal device CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 is 34% higher than that of the pristine CsPbIBr2, and the VOC, JSC and FF are significantly increased as well. Fig. S7 (ESI) displays the distribution results of the PCE, VOC, JSC and FF values of 50 independent devices (the average PCE are listed in Table 1), further confirming the superior photovoltaic performance and reproducibility of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSCs to that of pristine CsPbIBr2 and other Zn2+ doped PSCs. The photovoltaic performance enhancement is mainly from the optimized morphology and interface quality, including increased grain size, decreased defect states and reduced energy loss (Eloss). The hysteresis characteristic curves of the optimal CsPbIBr2 PSC and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC are depicted in Fig. 4d and the specific parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI). Compared with the severe hysteresis of CsPbIBr2 PSC (hysteresis index (HI) = 19.77%), the hysteresis of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC (HI = 11.13%) is greatly reduced, which is attributed to the suppressed charge recombination as the incorporation of 1% Zn2+ brought about a uniform and compact perovskite morphology with enlarged grain sizes and reduced pinholes.

Moreover, we tested the steady-state maximum power output of PSCs with CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2, as presented in Fig. 4e. Under a bias voltage (Vbias) of 0.90 V, the photocurrent density of pure CsPbIBr2 PSC increased slowly for the first 20 s and gradually stabilized to 7.29 mA cm−2, and yielded a PCE of 6.56% after stabilization. In contrast, under a higher Vbias = 0.97 V, CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC achieved an excellent stabilized photocurrent density of 9.86 mA cm−2 and produced a superior stabilized PCE of 9.58%. Thus, the stabilized maximum power output results not only consolidate the feasibility of low concentration (1%) doping of Zn2+ to achieve efficient all-inorganic planar CsPbIBr2 PSCs, but also prove its superior power output stability. In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the corresponding integrated JSC of the CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSCs are further explored (Fig. 4f). We can observe higher EQE values of the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC across the whole absorption ranges with the maximum value of up to 87.5%. The integrated JSC of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC is 11.75 mA cm−2, much higher than that of CsPbIBr2 PSC (10.05 mA cm−2). The integrated JSC values of CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 are almost consistent with the corresponding average JSC values tested from the J–V curve (Fig. S7c, ESI), indicating the effectiveness of the latter measurement.
The transient photocurrent (TPC) decay and the transient photovoltage (TPV) decay are carried out to investigate the dynamic properties of charge carriers in the PSCs. The former can evaluate the carrier extraction and transmission, and the latter can provide information about the carrier recombination process in the PSCs. On one hand, Fig. 5a indicates that TPC decay reduces from 12.98 μs of CsPbIBr2 PSC to 7.32 μs of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC, proving that the extraction and transport of charge carriers are more effective due to Zn2+ doping. On the other hand, the TPV response increases from 0.44 ms of CsPbIBr2 PSC to 1.39 ms of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC, which means that the carrier recombination is largely suppressed in the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC (Fig. S8, ESI), contributing to realizing highly efficient PSCs. The trap state density (Nt) and carrier transport properties in perovskite films are further determined via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements using a hole-only device (FTO/NiOx/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag). As demonstrated in Fig. 5b, the first linear correlation phase at the low bias voltage region represents an Ohm response. The next stage of the curve is a trap-filled limit region, which represents the filling process of the trap states. Nt is calculated by the onset voltage of trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) according to the following formula: Nt = 2ε0εrVTFL/(qL2), where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite, which is equal to 8,q is the elemental charge and L represents the film thickness. Fig. 5b indicates that the VTFL of CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 is 0.56 V and 0.24 V, for which the corresponding calculated Nt is 4.03 × 1015 and 1.72 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The significant drop in Nt is mainly ascribed to the uniformly distributed CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 film with large crystal and less grain boundaries. To further prove the reduced trap states and inspect the photocarrier dynamics in the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 film, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay of perovskite films deposited on the glass was measured (Fig. 5c). The corresponding carrier lifetimes were calculated by fitting the TRPL curves using the formula
where the fast decay component (
τ1) indicates surface recombination carrier lifetimes, the slow decay component (τ2) indicates bulk recombination carrier lifetimes, and A1, A2 are the corresponding decay amplitudes of τ1 and τ2. The specific parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI). It is observed that the calculated average carrier lifetime (τave) of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 is striking 6.37 ns, nearly three times that of pure CsPbIBr2 (2.27 ns). The longer carrier lifetime of the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 film indicates the greatly reduced nonradiative recombination behavior, which benefits from the improved crystallization with less grain boundaries and reduced defect states.

Furthermore, suppressed charge carrier recombination is also verified with the dark J–V curves of PSCs (Fig. S9, ESI). The dark JSC of CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC is much lower than that of CsPbIBr2 PSC, which reflects the better diode behavior and reduction of leakage currents and carrier recombination. Simultaneously, the interfacial carrier transfer and recombination kinetics of PSC was investigated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test. Nyquist plots are recorded in the dark with a Vbias of 1.0 V, with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz, and the equivalent circuit is presented in the inset of Fig. 5d. The series resistance (Rs) is related to the resistance of external circuits and substrates. Typically, the first semicircle at high frequencies is ascribed to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), while the second semicircle at low frequencies is responsible for the recombination resistance (Rrec). However, the simplification of transmission line model makes it difficult to identify the high frequency semicircle, resulting in the existence of only one main semicircle in the low frequency region. It is clear that the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 device shows a larger Rrec (9571.34 Ω) than that of the CsPbIBr2 device (5714.27 Ω), which indicates that the extraction speed of photon-generated carriers in the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 device is greatly accelerated. The dynamic property studies suggest that the optimized partial substitution of (1%) Pb2+ by Zn2+ provides longer carrier lifetime with less trap density and suppressed carrier recombination, together leading to improvement in device performance.
Besides high efficiency, device stability is another critical factor to promote the commercial applications of PSCs. Thus, long-term atmospheric environment stability and heat endurance of the champion CsPbIBr2 and CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSCs are further examined. Fig. 6a shows the time-dependent variation of normalized PCE for the PSCs without encapsulation stored at 25 °C under ambient air conditions with a controlled RH of 20%. It is clear that after 30 days of storage, the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC can maintain 91% of its initial efficiency but the CsPbIBr2 PSC can only maintain 68% of its initial efficiency, indicating the superior long-term air stability of the former. After being thermally attacked continuously at 85 °C in a N2 filled glovebox over 400 hours, the normalized PCE of the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC remains at 82% of its initial efficiency, while that of the CsPbIBr2 PSC is a poor 33%, as displayed in Fig. 6b. Apparently, this result demonstrates the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC has obtained improved thermostability due to 1% Zn2+ doping. Overall, the all-inorganic planar CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSC fabricated by substituting (1%) Pb2+ with Zn2+ undoubtedly possesses superior long-term moisture as well as heat stability, which possesses potential practical application prospects.

In summary, we have incorporated Zn2+ into the CsPbIBr2 perovskite structure by partial substitution of Pb. By doping an appropriate amount of 1% Zn2+ directly into the CsPbIBr2 precursor, high-quality photoactive films with improved crystallinity and morphology with enlarged grain sizes and less pinholes can be successfully obtained. Simultaneously, the photoelectronic properties including favorable energy level alignment, decreased trap density, and the suppressed carrier recombination were achieved for the CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 perovskite. Consequently, the all-inorganic PSC based on CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 perovskite film displayed the highest PCE of 10.51% and VOC up to 1.28 V, which were significantly improved compared with the pristine CsPbIBr2 PSC. In addition, CsPb0.99Zn0.01IBr2 PSCs also exhibit good long-term stability, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 30 days under atmospheric conditions and 81% of its initial efficiency after 400 hours of heating at 85 °C in a N2-filled glovebox. This work not only investigates the underlying factors determining the photovoltaic properties and long-term stability of the Zn-doped CsPbIBr2 PSCs, but also provides a new way of thinking for the commercialization process of all-inorganic PSCs.
