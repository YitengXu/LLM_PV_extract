To expand the photoresponse of perovskite solar cells, we implanted bulk heterojunctions to make integrated solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT/CH3NH3PbI3/(PDPP3T–PC61BM)/Ca/Al. The new cells gave higher Jsc than perovskite solar cells due to additional photocurrent contribution from the bulk heterojunction. This innovative design shows promise for the development of next-generation solar cells.

Since the first use of organometal halide perovskites as light absorbers in solar cells in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has already reached 19.3%. Organometal halide perovskites are attracting global attention and interest due to their outstanding light absorption, charge transport property and photovoltaic performance. Recently, several breakthroughs have been made for perovskite solar cells. Jeon et al. improved crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer via solvent engineering and obtained a 16.2% PCE. Mei et al. developed fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with a 12.8% PCE and high stability. Zhou et al. made perovskite solar cells with a 19.3% PCE by improving crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer and engineering the interfaces. Some interesting advances on perovskite solar cells have also been reported, such as lead-free cells, dopant-free hole transport materials (HTM), HTM-free cells, crystallization control and stability studies.

For solar cells, the light-harvesting capability of the active layer is most important. The absorption spectra of the materials are expected to cover most of the sunlight spectrum; thus solar cells can possibly produce more excitons and electricity. The bandgap of D–A conjugated polymers or small molecules used as donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells can be tuned facilely via changing their chemical structures. However, there is little room for changing the chemical composition of the perovskite absorber. To date, the most efficient perovskite absorbers are CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. CH3NH3PbI3 can absorb light until 800 nm, which limits the enhancement of the short-circuit current (Jsc). Replacing Pb with Sn leads to lower bandgap, but the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) decrease significantly. Replacing CH3NH3+ with formamidinium cation slightly decreases the perovskite bandgap but does not improve solar cell performance. Poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene) (PDPP3T) is a typical low-bandgap polymer with an optical bandgap of 1.33 eV (Fig. 1a), which is ∼0.22 eV lower than that of CH3NH3PbI3. By implanting PDPP3T–PC61BM bulk heterojunctions into perovskite solar cells (Fig. 1b), PDPP3T can absorb the long-wavelength light, complementing the perovskite absorption, and the integrated cell will receive the photocurrent from both perovskite and BHJ solar cells, leading to an expanded photoresponse. The integrated cells, with a structure of ITO/PEDOT/CH3NH3PbI3/(PDPP3T–PC61BM)/Ca/Al, were made by spin-coating a PDPP3T–PC61BM blend solution onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The energy level diagram for the integrated cells is shown in Fig. S1.
For BHJ solar cells under illumination, excitons generate, transport, and dissociate to be free electrons and holes at the PDPP3T–PC61BM interface. Electrons move to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PC61BM and are collected by the Al electrode. Holes on the PDPP3T transport through PEDOT and are collected by the ITO electrode. For perovskite solar cells under illumination, electrons transfer from the perovskite absorber to PC61BM and are collected by the Al electrode. Holes move to the PEDOT layer and are collected by the ITO electrode. In the integrated cells, perovskite acts as light absorber and hole transporter. Holes move from HOMO of PDPP3T to perovskite and are finally collected by the ITO electrode. Electrons move from perovskite and PDPP3T to the LUMO of PC61BM and are collected by the Al electrode (Fig. 1b). The integrated cells are designed to obtain additional photocurrent from the bulk heterojunction, thus giving a higher Jsc.
To understand light absorption of the integrated solar cells, we measured the absorption spectra for the PDPP3T–PC61BM blend film, CH3NH3PbI3 film and CH3NH3PbI3/(PDPP3T–PC61BM) bilayer film (Fig. 2). The films were prepared using the same condition used in their respective solar cell preparation. The thicknesses of the blend film, CH3NH3PbI3 film and bilayer film are 130 nm, 150 nm and 290 nm, respectively. The absorption spectrum of the blend film shows an onset at ∼930 nm, a peak at 843 nm and a shoulder at ∼771 nm. In the bilayer film absorption spectrum, PDPP3T contributes significantly at 550–937 nm. The absorption spectrum of the bilayer film demonstrates good accumulation of the respective absorption of perovskite film and the blend film.
The best BHJ solar cells were obtained with a 1:2 D–A ratio (wt), 4 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 130 nm thick active layer. The integrated cells were fabricated using those conditions for making the best BHJ cells and the best CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM cells. Device performance data are listed in Table 1. The best BHJ cells exhibited a Voc of 0.67 V, a Jsc of 8.82 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.07% and a PCE of 3.96%. The best CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM cells gave a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 13.09 mA cm−2, a FF of 80.33% and a PCE of 9.46%. The integrated cells gave a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 12.67 mA cm−2, a FF of 60.84% and a PCE of 6.63% (Fig. 3a). The standard deviations for the performance data are small, since the perovskite films are quite uniform. The high reproducibility of the performance data makes the evaluation of cell performance reliable. In EQE spectrum of the integrated cell, the 300–755 nm section mainly comes from the perovskite cell due to the strong absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 in that region (Fig. 3b). Compared with the perovskite cell, the EQE in the 300–755 nm section decreases, which might be due to reduced CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM interface caused by the existence of PDPP3T. EQE spectrum beyond 755 nm for the integrated cell mostly comes from the BHJ cell. EQE data beyond 772 nm are close to those of the BHJ cell, suggesting highly efficient hole transport in the perovskite layer. Jsc from J–V measurements are in agreement with the integrated photocurrent (cal. Jsc) from the EQE spectra, and the error is less than 3%. By reducing the thickness of the perovskite layer to 70 nm, more visible light can get through the perovskite layer and be absorbed by the BHJ cell, and we observe that the photoresponse for the integrated solar cell accumulates the contribution from each cell (Fig. S2 and Table S1).

The integrated solar cells gave the highest Jsc when PDPP3T–PC61BM ratio was 1:4 (wt) (Fig. S3 and Table S2). The thickness of the BHJ layer was then optimized (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The photoresponses for the integrated cells get close to that of perovskite cells at 300–760 nm when the BHJ layer thickness decreases from 130 nm to 45 nm, which might be due to the reduced recombination in the BHJ layer. The best integrated cell, with an 80 nm thick BHJ layer, gave a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 13.93 mA cm−2, a FF of 71.78% and a PCE of 8.80%. Its Jsc is higher than that of perovskite cells due to additional photocurrent contribution from the bulk heterojunction. PCE for the integrated cells can be enhanced by using highly efficient, low-bandgap polymers.

A discrepancy between forward and reverse bias scans always occurs in J–V measurements of perovskite solar cells, and it might relate to thickness, capacitance and charge carrier collection rate. In this work, J–V curves were measured under both forward and reverse bias scan (Fig. S4). The perovskite cell shows slight discrepancy, while the integrated cell shows almost no discrepancy. Thin perovskite film (150 nm) favors a fast response to bias scan in J–V measurements. In this communication, J–V curves under reverse scan were used for discussion.
In summary, an integrated solar cell combining a perovskite solar cell and a BHJ solar cell is invented. The integrated solar cell can be facilely made by spin-coating a D–A blend solution onto the perovskite layer. The low-bandgap polymer remarkably broadens the photoresponse of the perovskite solar cell. Enlarged photoresponse and enhanced photocurrent are benefits of the bulk heterojunction. By applying suitable high-performance, low-bandgap polymers and optimizing device structure and fabrication, PCE breakthrough can be made, and hopefully an applicable technology can be delivered to the solar cell industry.
