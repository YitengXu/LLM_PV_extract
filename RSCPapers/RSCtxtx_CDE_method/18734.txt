Two new random terpolymers, namely m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th, have been synthesized by incorporating the economical 2,5-difluorobenzene (FBZ) molecule in the backbone of donor polymers for application in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Replacing 5 and 10 mole percentage of expensive monomer 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (FTT) in the well-explored donor polymer PTB7-Th with ∼100-time economical FBZ, new terpolymers, m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th, were obtained. These new terpolymers showed a deeper HOMO energy level, a comparable LUMO energy level with improved morphology and more planar molecular arrangements. These factors led to a remarkable enhancement in open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc), which helped to achieve a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.78% (Voc = 0.852 V) with m1PTB7-Th as compared to 7.87% for PTB7-Th (Voc = 0.790 V). However, in case of m2PTB7-Th, Voc reached up to 0.880 V with a lower PCE of 3.46% due to the lower range of solar absorbance and less fill factor (FF). The hole and electron mobility of the polymer active layers were estimated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. m1PTB7-Th displayed improved hole and electron mobility values (2.68 × 10−4 and 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) as compared to PTB7-Th- and m2PTB7-Th-based devices since the polymer backbone had a lower dihedral angle and a superior blend morphology in thin films. The incorporation of the FBZ monomer into random copolymers has thus been shown to be a very effective method to synthesize cost-effective donor polymers to fabricate high performance PSCs with an improved Voc.

Solar energy, the most preeminent option among all renewable energy sources, can fulfil the increasing need for energy demand in an industrialized society, and it is also capable of substituting the conventional energy sources in coming decades. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained immense interest in the last decade due to their numerous advantages such as solution-processing and low cost efficient fabrication of flexible large-area devices using eco-friendly techniques. Donor–Acceptor (D–A) copolymers are one of the most efficient classes of solar materials due to their wide absorption, desirable HOMO–LUMO energy levels and adequate charge mobility. To improve the efficacy of PSCs, numerous techniques are being used, e.g., polymer backbone alteration, modulation of side chains, and introducing new bridging groups, but the fine-tuning of energy band gap, the position of HOMO and LUMO and molecular arrangements in thin films are difficult in case of this class of materials. The synthesis of new monomers to modify the photo-physical properties of these polymers also involves rigorous steps using costly building blocks. These limitations of D–A copolymers can be overcome using random copolymerization by incorporating a 3rd monomer (donor/acceptor), which can successfully tune the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties. These new terpolymers can be utilised for the comparative analysis on the impact of tailored structural features, and understand the correlation between molecular structure of the polymers and device properties.

The benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) units as building blocks for D–A copolymers are one of the most effective ones, which have drawn considerable attention in last decade. The combination of BDT and TT provides smooth thin films and a wide absorption to the polymer. Further presence of a carboxyl group and a fluorine atom on TT decreases the energy band gap of polymers via forming a quinoidal structure. PTB7-Th is one of the most explored polymers of this class in recent times, but its cost is too high as its synthesis involves expensive monomers. The introduction of a fluorine containing monomer on the polymer backbone is a useful strategy to enhance photovoltaic performance by utilizing the very small van der Waals radius of 1.35 Å and the high electronegativity of fluorine. There are reports in which non-covalent conformational locking (S⋯F, O⋯F or C⋯F) is being used to synthesize semi crystalline polymers, where these interactions have improved the intermolecular orderly packing and planarity of the polymer backbone.
Thus, in this study, with the objective of improving the performance of PTB7-Th, and reducing the overall cost, random terpolymers, m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th, were synthesized by the Stille poly-condensation reaction (Scheme 1). For this, 2,5-difluorobenzene (FBZ) was used in the polymerization reaction to partially substitute 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (FTT) during the coupling with thienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT-Th) to obtain the two terpolymers. The polymers, m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th, contained 5% and 10% of the FBZ monomer in the polymer backbones, respectively. The presence of FBZ could significantly improve the molecular alignment of the polymer in thin film by decreasing the dihedral angles between the monomers. The dihedral angle was reduced via several inter/intramolecular interactions (S⋯F, O⋯F or C⋯F) involving the fluorine atom present at the diagonal positions of FBZ. These non-covalent interactions could significantly control the movement and nano-morphology of the active layer thin film and enhance the short circuit current density (Jsc). The presence of extra fluorine atoms on the terpolymer backbone deepened their HOMO level without a drastic modification in the energy band gap, which helped to achieve a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.880 volts for m2PTB7-Th.

All the polymers were obtained in 75–79% yield as purple/black solid after the appropriate purification steps (Scheme 1, details given in the ESI). The as-synthesized terpolymer (m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th) structures confirmed by 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S1 and S2) had peaks at 7.69 ppm since the FBZ protons were merged with BDT-Th broad peaks (7.38–8.20 ppm). The molecular weight (Mw) of PTB7-Th, m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th were found to be 149 kDa, 261 kDa, and 122 kDa, respectively by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) (Fig. S3 and S4).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of all polymers (Fig. 1a) exhibited two absorption bands below 400 nm for localized π–π* transition, and 450–800 nm for the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between electron rich BDT-Th and relatively electron deficient FTT in the thin film. Nevertheless, due to the weaker accepting nature of FBZ, there was a blue shift in the UV-visible spectra for m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th. The absorption of m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th in the region of 300–650 nm had a higher intensity as compared to PTB7-Th. The spectral contribution of FBZ to the polymers might be the reason for this trend at the lower wavelength region. The energy band gaps were determined from the onset of the thin film UV-visible spectra of polymers. PTB7-Th and m1PTB7-Th had similar band gaps of 1.60 and 1.61 eV, respectively. However, in case of m2PTB7-Th, the band gap increased to 1.64 eV. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to further analyse the impact of FBZ incorporation on the energy levels of the terpolymers (using a three-electrode system) (Fig. S5). A significant positive shift of the oxidation potential (Eox) for terpolymers were observed with an increment in the percentage of FBZ incorporation. The HOMO energy level of polymers were determined to be 5.30, 5.54 and 5.62 eV for PTB7-Th, m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th, respectively, using the following equation, EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (Table 1). The presence of the extra fluorine on terpolymers deepened the HOMO energy level, which could effectively enhance the Voc of PSCs. The LUMO energy levels were found to be 3.70, 3.93 and 3.98 eV for PTB7-Th, m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th, respectively (Fig. 1b). The thermal stability of the donor polymers was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under argon atmosphere (Fig. S6) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. 10% weight loss was observed at 298 °C for m2PTB7-Th, which was much lower than 377 °C and 372 °C for PTB7-Th and m1PTB7-Th, respectively. The trend of decomposition temperatures (Td) of these polymers exhibited that the incorporation of FBZ in a higher ratio in the polymer backbone affected its thermal stability adversely. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 2) were utilized to study the non-covalent interactions, conformational locking, and dihedral angles. The dihedral angle between FTT and the BDT-Th unit was around 25.5° and 18.8°, which was reduced to 11.5° and 13.4°, respectively, when the FTT unit was replaced by FBZ in the optimized structural models. From the side view, it was clear that BDT-Th-FBZ-BDT was much more planar compared to BDT-Th-FTT-BDT, facilitating well-arranged intermolecular interactions and an improved morphology. Compared to the high performance donor polymer PTB7-Th, the modified polymers had deeper HOMO energy levels and lower dihedral angles in the polymer backbone, which assisted to gain a higher hole mobility. These properties made the new terpolymers potential materials for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Thin film X-ray diffractions (XRD) of polymer films were also examined to understand the molecular alignments and the crystalline nature of polymers in the thin-film state. The π–π stacking distance was calculated to be 3.89 Å from the diffraction peaks (22.47°) of the polymers (Fig. S7), suggesting that even with the varied FBZ incorporation in the polymer backbone, m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th had similar alignment patterns like PTB7-Th in the thin film. Thus, polymer thin films had also comparable crystallinities due to this small change in the backbone.

To evaluate the overall impact of the FBZ incorporation on the device performances, PSCs were fabricated using the blend of polymers and PC71BM with a conventional photovoltaic architecture (Fig. S8a). The active layer was processed in CB with DIO as an additive at room temperature. The J–V (current density–voltage) characteristic curves (Fig. 3a) demonstrated that PTB7-Th, m1PTB7-Th, and m2PTB7-Th had an efficiencies of 7.87%, 8.78%, and 3.46%, respectively (Table 2). Further, to calculate the hole mobility of the blend films of polymers (PTB7-Th, m1PTB7-Th, and m2PTB7-Th) with PC71BM, the device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Cu (Fig. S8b) was used, and the mobilities were found to be 2.08 × 10−4, 2.68 × 10−4, and 1.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S9). The hole mobility data indicated an improvement in mobility for m1PTB7-Th compared to PTB7-Th, which could contribute in the enhancement of Jsc of devices. On the contrary, further increment of the FBZ content in m2PTB7-Th hampered the charge carrier mobility within the device, which could be correlated with its comparably higher band gap, less solubility and blend morphology. To analyse the electron mobility of the polymer blend thin films, electron-only devices were fabricated with the architecture ITO/ZnO/polymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The electron mobilities were found to be 1.7 × 10−4, 1.9 × 10−4, and 7.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7-Th-, m1PTB7-Th-, and m2PTB7-Th-based devices, respectively (Fig. S10). The mobility of electron-only devices followed a similar trend like the hole only devices of polymer:PC71BM blends. m1PTB7-Th-based devices had a better electron mobility than the other two polymers. PTB7-Th- and m1PTB7-Th-based devices showed a well-balanced charge carrier mobility, and were expected to have better FF than m2PTB7-Th. Because of the improved Jsc and Voc, m1PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based PSCs showed better performances compared to the other two polymer blends. The enhancement in Jsc for m1PTB7-Th was attributed to the FBZ-induced conformational locking (S⋯F interaction) and its higher hole mobility as compared to other polymers. On the other hand, Voc was directly dependent on the differences between the HOMO level of the polymers and the LUMO level of the PC71BM. The Voc also gradually enhanced from 0.790 V (PTB7-Th) to 0.880 V (m2PTB7-Th), which was predicted from the lowering trend of HOMO with a higher FBZ incorporation. m1PTB7-Th-based PSCs had the highest PCE of 8.78% with a Voc of 0.850 V. The Jsc of m1PTB7-Th was higher compared to other polymers due to the better hole-mobility; however, on the other hand, the current density was lower for m2PTB7-Th because it had a lower solubility and an inferior absorption around the near-IR region. In Fig. 3b, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of polymers illustrated similar EQE for PTB7-Th and m1PTB7-Th of around 70%, but m2PTB7-Th had a lower EQE of 40–50%. The Jsc values derived from the integration of EQE graphs of PSCs were comparable and consistent with those observed by J–V characteristics for all PSC devices. To have a better understanding about the impact of the FBZ monomer on the morphology of blends and its correlation with the device performance, blend thin films were probed by AFM in the tapping mode (Fig. 4). The roughness (RMS) of the blend films were found to be 1.3 nm, 1.1 nm and 0.80 nm for PTB7-Th:PC71BM, m1PTB7-Th:PC71BM and m2PTB7-Th:PC71BM thin films, respectively, which showed a steady decrease in roughness with the increase in the FBZ content in the polymer backbone. The roughness values of thin films were consistent with the device performance of PSCs. Fluorine-induced non-covalent interactions helped in forming smoother thin films for m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th. However, the introduction of a monomer without a long hydrophobic alkyl chain affected the solubility of polymers, and hence, the film forming property of the blend solution. The thin film of the m2PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend had a low roughness (RMS) of 0.80 nm that affected the photovoltaic properties adversely. To obtain further insight into the morphology, the FETEM analysis was performed (Fig. 4d–f). The PTB7-Th blend with a homogeneous nano-morphology was observed with a little contrast between PC71BM and PTB7-Th. However, m1PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend exhibited a less homogeneous nano-structure in thin film, but displayed a better phase separation between the polymer and PC71BM. Such a distinct phase separation provided more channels for smoother charge transport in PSCs. m2PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend showed a smooth, but less nano-structured morphology, as the charge transport was not as effective as the other two blends. This decline in the nano-structured morphology may be attributed to higher FBZ-induced aggregation in the active layer thin film. It is evident that the presence of the diflurophenyl-based monomer in the polymer backbone played a critical role in tuning the device properties of PSCs. m1PTB7-Th showed a better photovoltaic performance than other polymers because of its broad absorption, improved alignment in device thin films and lower HOMO level, which enhanced the charge carrier mobility and the Voc of the PSCs.

In summary, a simple strategy has been developed to fine-tune the opto-electronic properties and film morphology of active polymer layers by incorporating the cost effective 2,5-difluorobenzene (FBZ) into the backbone of the well-known PTB7-Th polymer. Two random terpolymers m1PTB7-Th and m2PTB7-Th were synthesized by incorporating 5% and 10% of the FBZ unit in the polymer backbone, with PTB7-Th being synthesized as a reference. The incorporation of the FBZ unit in the polymer backbone resulted in a significant change in the opto-electronic properties of the polymers, such as the solar absorption, energy level of polymers and morphology of active layer films, which considerably influenced the performance of the PSCs. The incorporation of FBZ majorly changed the Voc from 0.790 to 0.880 V with the increment of the FBZ content in the polymer backbone, which was attributed to the lowering of the HOMO levels of terpolymers. A significant improvement of Jsc by 11% (from 15.57 mA cm−2 for PTB7-Th to 16.62 mA cm−2 for m1PTB7-Th) was also observed, attributed to the enhancement of the charge carrier mobility of thin films as confirmed from SCLC measurements. The improvement of Jsc and Voc collectively contributed in the enhancement of the PCE from 7.87% for PTB7-Th to 8.78% for m1PTB7-Th. This understanding on the influential impacts of a fluorinated bridging group will help to design and develop highly efficient and cost-effective solar materials for the next generation.
