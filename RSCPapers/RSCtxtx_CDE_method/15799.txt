In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of small amounts of phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) into all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) increases the photovoltaic performance without compromising mechanical properties. Ternary blend polymer solar cells (ternary-PSCs) consisting of a polymer donor (PTB7-Th) and an acceptor mixture with different weight ratios of a polymeric acceptor (P(NDI2HD-T2)) and PC71BM demonstrate the effects of PC71BM loading on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical properties. A significant enhancement in the PCEs of ternary-PSCs, from 6.32% to 7.33%, is observed when PC71BM is added into the active layer as up to 30 wt% of the acceptor mixture. Importantly, the excellent mechanical properties (i.e., crack onset strain = 11.6%, toughness = 2237 J m−3) of the blend films are well preserved at PC71BM loadings at or below 30 wt%. In contrast, both the PCE and the mechanical performance of the ternary-PSCs significantly decrease at higher PC71BM loadings (>50 wt%). Detailed morphological analysis via grazing incidence X-ray scattering measurements reveals that PC71BM molecules are well-dispersed in the amorphous portion of the active layer at PC71BM loadings up to 30 wt%. Therefore, both the mechanical and photovoltaic performances of the ternary-PSCs correlate closely with their morphological behavior, particularly in terms of the mixing behavior of PC71BM with polymers. The well-dispersed PC71BM molecules in the amorphous polymer domains facilitate efficient exciton dissociation, whereas the formation of PC71BM aggregates above a critical concentration causes severe mechanical degradation of the ternary-PSCs due to the presence of weak interfaces between the brittle PC71BM and polymer domains. Therefore, the ternary blends with optimal content of polymer/fullerene acceptors represent important candidates for flexible and wearable solar cells that require both high mechanical and photovoltaic performances.

Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising electricity generation technologies for flexible and wearable devices owing to their flexibility, light weight, and multi-colored semi-transparency. To date, substantial effort has been devoted to developing fullerene-based PSCs (fullerene-PSCs) because fullerene derivatives such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) exhibit high electron mobility, producing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 11–12%. However, the practical application of fullerene-PSCs has been limited by their instability under photo, thermal and mechanical stresses as well as the low light absorption of fullerenes in the visible region. In particular, the fullerene derivatives in fullerene-PSCs are highly brittle and can diffuse rapidly under sunlight (heat) exposure, giving rise to significant instability against mechanical and thermal stresses, respectively.

All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), in which fullerene acceptors are replaced by n-type conjugated polymer chains, have been extensively studied as alternatives to fullerene-PSCs that often exhibit remarkably improved mechanical and thermal stability. Despite their advantages, the PCEs of all-PSCs remain lower than those of fullerene-PSCs; there are only limited examples of all-PSCs with PCEs over 8%. The inferior PCEs in all-PSCs is mainly attributed to the highly anisotropic packing structure of n-type polymers, which often produce unoptimized charge transport in the thin films as well as charge generation efficiency at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. To maximize the efficiencies of free charge carrier generation and charge transport to each electrode, the backbones of both the p-type and n-type polymers should be oriented so as to facilitate face-on stacking. However, the optimization of the polymer orientation by solution processing is often challenging, and thus the excitons located in the amorphous regions in all-PSCs frequently undergo geminate recombination. In this regard, it is critical to enhancing charge generation in all-PSCs in order to leverage their important advantages for successful realization of flexible and portable solar cells.
Herein, we present a facile strategy that combines the merits of both fullerene-PSCs and all-PSCs to significantly increase the PCE of the all-PSCs without compromising mechanical performance (Scheme 1). Highly efficient and mechanically robust all-PSCs were achieved by simply incorporating phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) into all-PSC binary blends, in which poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) and poly{[N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (P(NDI2HD-T2)) are used as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively (Scheme 1). We found PC71BM to disperse well into the amorphous polymer phases of the all-PSC blends when a small amount of PC71BM (<30 wt% of the acceptor mixture) was added, resulting in a significant enhancement in free charge carrier generation. Consequently, the PCE increased from 6.32% (PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T2) binary all-PSCs) to 7.33% (PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T2):PC71BM 30% ternary-PSCs). Interestingly, addition of PC71BM did not adversely affect the mechanical properties, which are attributed to the miscibility of low amounts of PC71BM (up to 30 wt%) with the polymer blend. For example, the crack onset strain of the PC71BM 30% ternary blend film (10.7%) was close to that of the all-PSC binary blend film (11.6%). However, addition of PC71BM above a critical concentration (>50 wt%) produced PC71BM aggregates in the ternary blend, causing a significant decrease in both the PCE and mechanical properties. For example, the crack onset strain value for the fullerene-PSC (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) blend film was only 1.1%. Therefore, our results suggest that the mixing behavior of polymer:PC71BM critically impacts both the photovoltaic and mechanical performances of ternary-PSCs, and thus should be considered carefully when designing active layer blends to produce highly efficient and mechanically robust PSCs.

To explore how the incorporation of PC71BM into all-polymer blends of PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T2) affects the photovoltaic performance, inverted-type PSCs with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layers/MoO3/Ag were fabricated as shown in Scheme 1. All of the blend films were deposited with a fixed donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio of 1.3:1 (w/w), but with different weight ratios of P(NDI2HD-T2):PC71BM. No additional treatment, such as thermal (or solvent) annealing or solvent additives, was applied in order to isolate the effects of the added PC71BM on the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the ternary-PSCs. For reference, fullerene-PSCs comprised of PTB7-Th and PC71BM (PC71BM-PSCs) were also prepared as previously reported, under conditions yielding optimal device performance (D:A ratio of 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene (CB) with 3 vol% diiodooctane (DIO) additive).Fig. 1a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of representative devices, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The average PCE of the all-PSC control (PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T2)) was 5.91%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.98 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.80 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.50, consistent with our previous reports. By adding a small amount of PC71BM into the all-PSC binary blend, the JSC and FF values increased, while the VOC values were almost identical (0.80–0.81 V) (Table 1). In particular, the JSC and FF values of PC71BM 30% improved significantly from 14.98 mA cm−2 and 0.50 for all-PSCs without PC71BM, to 15.99 mA cm−2 and 0.53, respectively. As a result, a peak average PCE of 6.80% with a maximum value of 7.33% was achieved from the PC71BM 30% devices, which is a 15% enhancement compared to the all-PSC control blend. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the all-PSC binary blend and ternary blends, PC71BM 10, 30, and 50%, are shown in Fig. 1b. The calculated JSC from the EQE measurements were within 3% of the measured JSC values. We observed that the EQE values gradually increased with the amount of PC71BM in the acceptor blend, particularly in the short wavelength region around 500 nm. This finding is attributed to the different absorption regimes of PC71BM and P(NDI2HD-T2), and is a general phenomenon observed in ternary PSC systems comprised of two electron acceptors with different light absorption ranges. However, given that the addition of PC71BM to the all-PSC blends significantly decreased the absorption intensity between 600 and 800 nm due to the decreased amount of P(NDI2HD-T2), the enhancement in JSC cannot be explained by the complementary absorption of PC71BM and P(NDI2HD-T2) (Fig. S1). To quantitatively investigate the relationship between the light absorption characteristics of the active layer blends and photocurrent generation in the ternary devices, the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of the devices, which is strongly correlated with their light absorption ability, was determined by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) over a broad range of bias voltages (Fig. S2a). Detailed procedures for these measurements are described elsewhere. The Gmax values of all of the devices fabricated under optimized conditions are summarized in Table 1. The control all-PSC and the ternary PC71BM 10% devices were calculated to have the highest Gmax values of 2.6 × 1028 m−3 s−1, and the Gmax values decreased gradually with increasing the amounts of PC71BM, from 2.4 × 1028 (PC71BM 30%) to 2.1 × 1028 m−3 s−1 (PC71BM 50%). Taken together, these experiments support the conclusion that the enhancement of JSC in the ternary-PSCs is not due to the complementary absorption of PC71BM and P(NDI2HD-T2).

To further probe the cause of the enhanced JSC in the ternary-devices, we next examined whether the incorporation of a small amount (10–30 wt%) of PC71BM improved the efficiency of free charge carrier generation and/or charge transport ability. First, to assess the influence of the added PC71BM on the efficiency of free charge carrier generation in the ternary-PSCs, we obtained the exciton dissociation probabilities (P(E,T)) by calculating the ratio of Jph under short circuit conditions and Jph,sat in the photocurrent analysis shown in Fig. S2a. The calculated P(E,T) values gradually increased from 0.79 for all-PSCs to 0.83 for PC71BM 30% and 0.86 for PC71BM 50%, and then decreased to 0.77 for PC71BM 90%. A correlation between the P(E,T) and JSC values of the ternary blend devices was observed as a function of PC71BM concentration (Fig. S2b), indicating that the enhancement of the JSC in the ternary-PSCs was mainly due to the increase in the degree of exciton dissociation. Next, to investigate the effects of the PC71BM loading on charge transport in the ternary-PSCs, we measured electron (μe) and hole mobilities (μh) by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Table S1, the μh and μe of all-PSCs were determined to be 1.2 × 10−4 and 3.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The addition of PC71BM 10%, 30% and 50% did not improve the μh and μe values of the ternary-PSCs, thus the enhanced PCEs of the ternary blend devices with PC71BM are not due to changes in charge transport ability. This is unexpected because PC71BM molecules typically yield higher electron mobility than the polymer acceptor (i.e., P(NDI2HD-T2)). We suspect that the amount of added PC71BM molecules is insufficient to form percolation pathways between PC71BM domains to facilitate electron transport. The results of the SCLC mobility and Jph measurements suggest that modest PC71BM loadings (<50% of the acceptor blend) improved the efficiency of free charge carrier generation in ternary-PSCs, leading to higher JSC and PCE values. However, at higher PC71BM loadings (≥50%), the FF of the ternary-PSCs significantly decreased, indicating an optimal composition of the ternary blends of 30 wt% PC71BM. These results correlated closely with the morphological evolution of the ternary blends as a function of PC71BM content, as discussed further below.

We then examined the effect of PC71BM loading on the mechanical properties of the active layer of the ternary-PSCs at a D:A ratio = 1.3:1. For comparison, PC71BM-PSC blend films (D:A ratio = 1:1.5) were also investigated. In order to obtain the tensile characteristics of the blend films, we carried out a free-standing tensile test, which enables the direct measurement of the intrinsic properties of thin films on the surface of water. In our previous work, the tensile characteristics of BHJ active films of PSCs were measured using a bar-shaped tensile testing specimen. In this study, we adopted improved tensile testing procedures by replacing the bar-shaped specimen with a dog bone-shaped specimen because the inhomogeneous strain distribution near the grips in the bar-shaped specimen may result in underestimated crack onset strain measurements (Fig. 2a). Therefore, free-standing tensile tests were performed with dog bone-shaped specimens to facilitate more reliable mechanical measurements of thin films. Fig. S3 shows quantitative differences in the strain–stress curves obtained from the bar-shaped and dog bone-shaped samples of model all-PSC and PCBM-PSC blend films.


Fig. 2b displays representative stress–strain curves of the blend films from the tensile test, and the resulting elastic moduli and crack onset strains are summarized in Table S2. The stress–strain curve of the all-PSC films showing a clear yield point revealed the superior mechanical characteristics, with low stiffness and high ductility (elastic modulus = 0.98 GPa and crack onset strain = 11.6%), compared to those of the PC71BM-PSC films, for which no yield point was observed (elastic modulus = 2.64 GPa and crack onset strain = 1.1%) (Table S2). These measurements agreed well with those in our previous report on the mechanical properties of all-PSCs and PCBM-PSCs. The high elastic modulus of the PC71BM-PSC blend film originated from the highly brittle nature of PC71BM phases, which generally results in increased stiffness and reduced ductility of polymer blend films. Interestingly, however, the incorporation of highly brittle PC71BM up to 30% did not cause a reduction in the ductility of the ternary blend films: the crack onset strains measured in both PC71BM 10% and 30% films were almost equal to those of all-PSC films (Fig. 2c and Table S2). In addition, the elastic modulus increased slightly upon incorporation of PC71BM, from 0.98 (all-PSCs) to 1.29 GPa (PC71BM 30%), but was still much lower than that of PC71BM-PSCs (2.64 GPa) (Table S2). The excellent mechanical properties of all-PSCs and the PC71BM 10% and PC71BM 30% films were further confirmed by calculation of film toughness by integration of the stress–strain curves. As shown in Fig. 2d and Table S2, the toughness of the PC71BM 30% film was found to be 2160 J m−3, which is comparable to that of all-PSCs (2237 J m−3) and 14 times greater than that of the PC71BM-PSC blend film (154 J m−3). Further increasing the PC71BM content in the acceptor mixture to 50 wt% resulted in decreased crack onset strain (7.6%), and the PC71BM-PSC film showed a significantly decreased crack onset strain of ∼1.1% due to the high PC71BM content. We then compared the crack propagation behaviors of the blend films during the tensile test by optical microscopy (Fig. 3). In general, brittle polymer films crack with a crazing zone under tensile stress, whereas a ductile polymer film fractures with a necked zone and a plastic zone. The all-polymer blend films showed the typical crack formation expected for ductile polymer films as shown in Fig. 3, highlighting the superior mechanical resilience of all-PSCs. The ductile active layer of the all-PSCs undergoes significant plastic deformation as polymer chains are expected to be stretched and pulled out during tensile measurements. In the plastic wake, extrinsic mechanisms, such as bridging of polymer chains, may contribute to the toughening of the all-PSCs. Similarly, high ductility was observed for the PTB7-Th:P(NDI2HD-T2):PC71BM blend films with low fullerene loading (<30%) as shown in their crack morphologies, which included the necked zone and plastic zone. However, in the case of the PC71BM-PSC blend film, crack propagation proceeded rapidly without plastic deformation even at very low strain (1.1%), consistent with the brittle characteristic of PC71BM domains. The high elastic modulus of the PC71BM-rich phase may promote stress concentration at the weak polymer/fullerene interfaces in the strongly phase-separated BHJ films and lead to brittle failure without significant plastic deformation.

Photovoltaic and mechanical characterization of the all-PSCs and ternary-PSCs revealed a marked transition of properties for ternary-PSC blends at PC71BM loadings of ca. 30 wt%: the addition of PC71BM up to 30% improved the PCE while maintaining the mechanical properties (i.e., crack onset strain and toughness) of all-PSCs; however both mechanical and photovoltaic performances decreased at higher PC71BM loadings (Fig. 4). We hypothesized that these trends were closely related to the morphology of the ternary blends and, in particular, the mixing behavior of PC71BM with the polymeric components, and thus sought to determine the morphology of the blends as a function of PC71BM content in the acceptor mixture.

Fullerene derivatives have been reported to be miscible with the amorphous regions of semi-crystalline conjugated polymers at sufficiently low fullerene contents, i.e., below the ‘miscibility limit’. This mixing behavior of fullerenes in the BHJ blend is one of the most important factors influencing the charge carrier transport and charge generation in PSCs. For example, it was observed, for blend films of a low bandgap polymer and PC61BM with low PC61BM loadings, that PC61BM was preferentially located in the amorphous phases of the semi-crystalline polymers, yielding molecularly mixed regions of polymers and PC61BM. Pure PC61BM phases formed at higher loadings after the amorphous phases were filled with PC61BM. Similarly, we observed that independent fullerene-rich phases consisting largely of PC61BM aggregates were produced above a critical concentration of PC61BM in the ternary blend films consisting of a polymer donor, a polymer acceptor, and PC61BM. To investigate the formation of intermixed phases of PC71BM in our ternary-PSC film and determine the critical content of PC71BM leading to phase-separation of PC71BM from the polymer domains, we compared the grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) images of the ternary blend films as a function of PC71BM content (Fig. S4). In 2D-GIXS patterns, qxy and qz represent the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the scattering vector q, respectively. The 2D-GIXS patterns for all-PSC blend films consistently presented strong (100) and (010) peaks in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, respectively. These results indicate that the polymers are preferentially face-on orientated in all-PSCs. As the PC71BM concentration was increased to 50%, no obvious change in the scattering pattern was observed, indicating that PC71BM did not significantly alter the molecular orientation of PTB7-Th and P(NDI2HD-T2).
To quantitatively evaluate the degree of PC71BM mixing in the blend films, we examined the scattering intensity at qxy ≈ 1.35 Å−1, originating from PC71BM aggregates. For the quantitative comparison, we performed GIXS experiments with a constant incidence angle and sample size, and normalized the in-plane intensity profiles by the exposure time and sample thickness (Fig. 5a). Then, the area under the PC71BM peaks was calculated by using a Gaussian fit model. Fig. 5b displays the area under the PC71BM peaks calculated from the normalized intensity plots as a function of PC71BM content. As expected, the normalized intensities of the peaks corresponding to PC71BM aggregates in profiles acquired on PC71BM 10% and 30% were low and similar to those of all-PSCs, indicating negligible aggregate formation (Fig. 5b). As the concentration of PC71BM was further increased to 50%, the normalized intensity significantly enhanced, revealing the formation of a PC71BM phase in the ternary blend films. To support the formation of well-mixed and phase-separated domains as a function of PC71BM content, the coherence lengths of the (100) peaks were calculated using the simple Scherrer equation. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5b, the coherence length shows a monotonic decrease from 77.0 Å (PC71BM 0%) to 68.9 Å (PC71BM 10%) and 59.5 Å (PC71BM 30%), indicating that the presence of intermixed PC71BM molecules within polymer domains reduced the crystallization of the polymer chains. The coherence length plateaued at PC71BM contents above 50% to 61.1 (PC71BM 50%) and 58.1 Å (PC71BM 90%), likely due to the formation of the phase-separated PC71BM aggregates that did not affect the crystalline behavior of the polymers.

Fig. 6a contains schematic depictions of the blend morphology of all-PSC and ternary-PSC films revealed from GIXS measurements, particularly in the region near the D/A interface to visualize the morphological evolution of PC71BM phases and its effect on charge generation and mechanical properties with respect to PC71BM content. All-PSC blend films are composed of relatively pure crystalline phases of PTB7-Th and P(NDI2HD-T2), as well as amorphous phases. In ternary blend films with low PC71BM contents (<30%), PC71BM preferentially dispersed in the amorphous regions of the polymers, but PC71BM aggregates are expected to form in films with PC71BM contents higher than 50%. Previous reports have found mixtures of fullerenes and conjugated polymers to be miscible at low volume fractions of fullerene, whereas fullerene aggregates begin to form above a certain fullerene content resulting from demixing of fullerenes and conjugated polymers, where the miscibility is determined by the crystallinity of the conjugated polymers as well as thermodynamic interactions. From the viewpoint of charge generation in all-PSC blends, excitons generated from the amorphous PTB7-Th phases often undergo geminate recombination due to inefficient exciton delocalization over adjacent crystalline phases of P(NDI2HD-T2). Unlike long polymer chains, fullerene derivatives having a quasi-spherical shape do not exhibit a strong preferential orientation with polymer donors at the D/A interface. Therefore, when a small amount of PC71BM is added, as in PC71BM 30% ternary blend films, the well-dispersed PC71BM molecules in the amorphous region facilitate exciton delocalization over neighboring molecules, which increases the exciton dissociation probability and the resulting PCE (Fig. 6a).
The mechanical properties of the ternary-PSCs also correlated strongly with the mixing behavior of PC71BM in the blend films. In general, there are two feasible routes in the fracture process of polymer:fullerene blends under external mechanical stress: the fracture can propagate (1) through the D/A interfaces between the polymer domains and fullerene aggregates or (2) within the phase-separated, brittle fullerene aggregates. Recently, Dauskardt et al. observed in poly(3-hexylthiophene):PCBM blends that the adhesion energy at the interface between the polymer and fullerene domains was weaker than the cohesion energy within the fullerene aggregates. Kim et al. also reported the interfaces between the polymer and fullerene domains to be the weakest parts of the sample, acting as debonding sites during the mechanical failure. As such, we expected that in our ternary-blend system, the interfaces between the polymers and the fullerene aggregates would determine the mechanical properties of the ternary-PSC films; therefore, the ternary blends with high PC71BM loading (>50%) were expected to have much lower mechanical properties due to the formation of PC71BM aggregates. We show the microstructural features of the ternary blends with different PC71BM contents under strain in Fig. 6b. In the ternary blends with the high PC71BM loadings (>50%), PC71BM aggregates form and simultaneously generate interfaces between PC71BM aggregates and polymer domains where the cracks propagate. In contrast, in ternary films with low PC71BM contents (≤30%), the PC71BM dispersed well in the amorphous polymer phase, affording superior mechanical properties. Consequently, the all-PSC and ternary blend films of PC71BM 10%, and PC71BM 30% have similarly high crack onset strains (11–12%) and toughness.

Highly efficient and mechanically robust ternary-PSCs were developed by introducing a small amount of PC71BM into all-PSCs. We found the optimal amount of PC71BM to be 30 wt% of the acceptor mixture, which increased the PCE while retaining the excellent mechanical properties of all-PSCs. The PC71BM was found to be well-mixed in the amorphous phase of the D/A interface at PC71BM contents at or below 30 wt%, and to increase the efficiency of free charge carrier generation. At higher loadings (>50 wt%), PC71BM aggregates started to form. As a result, we successfully improved the PCE of all-PSCs from 6.32 to 7.33% by including 30 wt% PC71BM of the acceptor mixture. More importantly, the well-dispersed PC71BM did not adversely influence the mechanical properties of blend films: the crack onset strain and toughness of the PC71BM 30% blend films were measured to be 10.7% and 2160 J m−3, respectively, almost identical to the values of all-PSCs. In contrast, PC71BM aggregates produced at PC71BM loadings above 50% significantly degraded the mechanical properties of the blend films by generating weak interfaces between the polymer and PC71BM domains. Thus, optimizing the content of PC71BM to form an intermixed phase with the polymers without causing strong phase-separation of PC71BM molecules is critical to achieving highly efficient and mechanically robust PSCs. Our results suggest that the “best of both worlds” of photovoltaic performance and mechanical durability can be achieved by combining the merits of all-PSCs and fullerene-PSCs.


All reagents were purchased from Aldrich Co. and TCI and used without further purification. PTB7-Th (number average molecular weight (Mn) = 22.9 kg mol−1 and dispersity (Đ) = 2.2) and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material and Nano-C, respectively. P(NDI2HD-T2) (Mn = 44.9 kg mol−1 and Đ = 2.64) was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure.


The structure and molecular weight information (Mn and Đ) of polymers were characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), respectively, according to our previous report. UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine and blend films were measured using a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific instruments). The SCLC mobility of the blend films was measured and calculated as previously reported. GIXS measurements were performed at the PLS-II 9A beamline in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (South Korea). X-rays (wavelength λ = 1.111 Å) were generated from an in-vacuum undulator (IVU) using a double crystal monochromator and focused both horizontally and vertically (300 μm (H) × 30 (V) μm onto the sample) using K–B type mirrors. The sample-to-detector distance was 224 mm. For the GIXS measurements, the films were prepared by spin coating optimized active layer blends (i.e., those yielding the highest PCE) onto a 1.0 cm × 1.0 cm Si substrate. The incidence angle was adjusted to ∼0.13° to allow complete penetration of X-rays into the polymer films.


All devices were fabricated as inverted-type PSCs with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially rinsed with acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol by ultrasonication. Then, residual solvent on the substrates was dried at 80 °C for 1 h. The ZnO layer (∼40 nm thick) was deposited by spin coating after treatment of the ITO-coated glass with O2 plasma for 10 min. For the active layer blends, the D:A ratio was kept at 1.3:1 (w/w) while the weight ratios of P(NDI2HD-T2):PC71BM in A were varied from 1.0:0 to 0:1.0 and the total concentration (D + A) in chloroform was 10 mg mL−1. Each blend solution was stirred for 1 h at 45 °C and spin-coated onto the ITO/ZnO substrates. The resulting thickness of each film was found to be ∼80 nm. Finally, the MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (120 nm) layers were sequentially deposited using a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (less than 10−6 Torr). The active area of the fabricated device was 0.09 cm2, as measured by optical microscopy. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 SMU and solar simulator (K201 LAB55, McScience) according to a previously reported procedure. EQEs were measured using a spectral measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience).


Tensile testing specimens of all-PSC and PC71BM-PSC blend films were prepared on poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS)-coated glass substrates. Dog bone-shaped specimens were fabricated using a femtosecond laser patterning method. By dissolving the soluble PSS sacrificial layer, the blend film was detached from the glass substrate, and subsequently floated on water. To manipulate the tensile specimen on the surface of water, PDMS-coated Al grips were attached to the specimen gripping region. The tensile test was performed by applying tensile strain using a linear stage with a strain rate of 0.3 × 10−3 s−1. During the tensile test, stress and strain data were obtained from a load cell and a digital image correlation system, respectively.
