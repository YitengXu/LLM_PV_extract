Recently, we developed fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) as a class of high-performance nonfullerene acceptors, which have been widely used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we explore new functions of FREAs in addition to being an acceptor in a photoactive layer, and use them as an interfacial layer, which significantly improves the performance of OSCs. Compared with the conventional cathode modifying layers (CMLs) of ZnO and ZnO/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE), a novel CML of ZnO/FREA/PEIE enhances the optical mode and absorption of the device and suppresses geminate recombination via charge separation, both of which increase the short-circuit current density. In addition, FREAs passivate the surface defects of ZnO and then facilitate electron transport. The OSCs based on ZnO/FREA/PEIE exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 13.04%, higher than those based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE (12.15% and 12.12%).

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted enormous attention during the past three decades, due to their various competitive properties, such as light weight, solution processability, semitransparency, and easy integration with flexible substrates. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have steadily increased to 13–17%, implying a bright future for organic photovoltaic technology.

Unlike silicon and perovskite semiconductors, organic semiconducting materials suffer from geminate exciton recombination instead of exciton dissociation upon light absorption, ascribed to their large exciton binding energies (≥0.1 eV); while at the interface between the organic electron donor and acceptor, the excitons can be efficiently split into free carriers. Thus, a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) comprising a donor and an acceptor has been developed as a photoactive layer in OSCs, which features the morphology of nanoscale phase separation between the donor and acceptor. The BHJ photoactive layer possesses a large-magnitude exciton-splitting interface to generate free holes and electrons efficiently and to suppress geminate recombination. Because the polymer donor generally has lower surface energy than the acceptor, during solution spin-coating, the donor and acceptor tend to accumulate towards the top and bottom surfaces of the blend film, respectively. Therefore, the inverted device structure where the bottom of the photoactive layer is in contact with the cathode is expected to exhibit a higher PCE than the regular device structure where the top of the photoactive layer is in contact with the cathode. At the bottom of the photoactive layer, the interface of donor and acceptor phases becomes minimized compared to that in the bulk of the photoactive layer. Therefore, the charge separation in the bottom zone of the photoactive layer is unlikely to be as efficient as in the bulk of the photoactive layer, leading to increased geminate recombination and power loss in inverted OSCs.
During the last 2 decades, fullerene derivatives have been almost exclusively used as acceptors in OSCs which yielded best PCEs of 11–12%. Nevertheless, fullerene acceptors suffer from some drawbacks, such as weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region, limited tunability of electronic properties, thermal instability, and photochemical instability, which limit further development of this field. In 2015, we proposed a new concept termed a “fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA)” and developed a class of high-performance nonfullerene acceptors, led by the benchmark molecule ITIC. FREAs with an acceptor–donor–acceptor structure exhibit broad absorption with a large absorption coefficient, high electron mobility, and tunable energy levels. Furthermore, the substituents out of the fused-ring main plane in FREAs can be used to control molecular aggregation and manipulate the phase separation in BHJ blend films. Invention of the ITIC family is advancing the entire field of OSCs to a new level; efficiencies were previously limited to ∼11–12%, and now based on FREAs, efficiencies around 15–17% are being achieved.
In this work, we explore novel functions of FREAs beyond the acceptor role in the photoactive layer, and use it as an interfacial layer, which significantly improves the performance of inverted OSCs. First, the thin FREA interlayer enhances the optical mode of the device and absorption of the active layer, facilitating the increase of short-circuit current density (JSC). Second, the thin FREA interlayer suppresses the geminate recombination in the donor phase at the bottom of the active layer via long-range charge separation, leading to an increase in JSC. Third, FREA molecules facilitate electron transport via passivating the surface defects of the ZnO thin film. The PCE of the inverted OSCs based on the new cathode modifying layer ZnO/FREA/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) is 13.04%, markedly higher than that of the control devices based on conventional ZnO (12.15%) and ZnO/PEIE (12.12%). It is worth noting that the inclusion of the PEIE interlayer protects the FOIC interlayer from being rinsed out during spin-coating of the photoactive layer in layer-by-layer processed donor:acceptor/acceptor ternary OSCs.

Recently, we reported a high-performance FREA molecule, FOIC, which exhibits strong NIR absorption, high electron mobility and high efficiency in combination with a classical narrow-bandgap polymer donor, PTB7-Th (Fig. 1). Here, we fabricated inverted OSCs based on PTB7-Th:FOIC photoactive layers using cathode modifying layers (CMLs) of ZnO, ZnO/PEIE, and ZnO/FOIC/PEIE, respectively. These three OSCs show a similar average open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.713 to 0.720 V and average fill factor (FF) of 0.702 to 0.710. The average JSC (25.04 mA cm−2) based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is higher than those (23.45 and 23.41 mA cm−2) based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE. The average PCE based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is 12.75%, better than those (11.79% and 11.85%) based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

The optical and electrical properties of the three CMLs have been investigated. Fig. S1 shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnO, ZnO/PEIE, and ZnO/FOIC/PEIE. The strong emission centered at ca. 380 nm originates from the band-to-band recombination of ZnO, while the emission band from 500 to 600 nm results from the recombination of electrons with holes trapped in oxygen vacancies on the surface of the ZnO thin film. The emission related to the surface defects of ZnO in ZnO/FOIC/PEIE decreases compared with that in ZnO and ZnO/PEIE, suggesting that FOIC passivates the ZnO surface defects. Electron mobility based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is measured to be 2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than those based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE (1.0 × 10−3 and 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, Fig. S2), indicating that ZnO/FOIC/PEIE enhances electron transport more than ZnO and ZnO/PEIE, likely due to the passivation of surface defects by the FOIC interlayer.

Fig. 3 displays the optical reflectance spectra of the three OSCs. Relative to ZnO and ZnO/PEIE, ZnO/FOIC/PEIE enhances the optical absorption of the device in the range from 520 to 710 nm, which is mainly due to PTB7-Th absorption. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is thus higher in the solar cell based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE. We also notice improved internal quantum efficiency (IQE) in the range from 500 to 820 nm for the OSC based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE, compared to that based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE (Fig. 4). The total photocurrent density (Jph) of the OSC based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is calculated to be 29.04 mA cm−2, higher than that based on ZnO (28.46 mA cm−2) and ZnO/PEIE (27.93 mA cm−2) (Table S1). To investigate the reason for the enhanced EQE in the ZnO/FOIC/PEIE solar cell, an optical transfer matrix (TM) simulation is used (Fig. S3). TM simulation suggests that the FOIC interlayer can act as an optical medium to improve the active layer absorption in the wavelength range of 500–700 nm.
Generally, the photocurrent losses in organic solar cells are due to geminate recombination of photo generated excitons. Considering the very small values of the photocurrent loss caused by the parasitic resistances (Jloss,par, Table S1), the proportion of the geminate recombination in the optical absorption of the device (Pgem) at a given wavelength can be expressed as Pgem = 1 − IQE. Pgem in the OSC based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is smaller than that based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE in the range from 500 to 820 nm, which largely overlaps with the absorption range of PTB7-Th (Fig. S4), implying that the thin FOIC interlayer facilitates the exciton splitting in the PTB7-Th phase located at the bottom zone of the photoactive layer. In the range from 850 to 950 nm, Pgem in the OSC based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is slightly larger than that based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE, because the thin FOIC interlayer provides parasitic absorption somewhat (Fig. S5) and the resulting excitons get quenched by the surface defects of ZnO. The percentage of the photocurrent loss due to the geminate recombination (Jloss,gem) in total Jph is estimated to be 19.8%, 17.3%, and 15.3% for the devices based on ZnO, ZnO/PEIE, and ZnO/FOIC/PEIE, respectively (Table S1). The FOIC interlayer suppresses geminate recombination and facilitates the exciton splitting in the PTB7-Th phase located at the bottom zone of the photoactive layer.
To further probe the effects of the CMLs on the geminate recombination in PTB7-Th, three reference inverted OSCs based on a PTB7-Th single-component photoactive layer were fabricated using ZnO, ZnO/PEIE, and ZnO/FOIC/PEIE as the CML, respectively (Fig. S6, Table S2). The OSC based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE exhibits a stronger photoresponse than that based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE (Fig. S7), accounting for a remarkable increase in the JSC (Table S2), indicating that FOIC facilitates the exciton splitting in PTB7-Th, which is consistent with the observation in Fig. S3 and S4. The OSCs based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE do not exhibit an appreciable EQE response in the range above 800 nm, indicating that the excitons photogenerated in the FOIC interlayer are quenched by ZnO.
The transient PL spectra of PTB7-Th on the three substrates are shown in Fig. S8. The shorter PL lifetime of PTB7-Th on ZnO than that on ZnO/PEIE suggests that the PEIE prevents the PTB7-Th excitons from being quenched by ZnO surface defects, in line with the assumption that the Pgem based on ZnO is larger than that based on ZnO/PEIE (Table S1). The shorter PL lifetime of PTB7-Th on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE than that on ZnO/PEIE implies that the exciton dissociation in PTB7-Th is enhanced by the FOIC interlayer, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. S4 and S7. Though separated by a thin PEIE layer, FOIC effectively promotes splitting of the excitons in PTB7-Th into free carriers, experimentally proving that the charge separation between the donor and acceptor can efficiently take place over a long distance.

Fig. 5 describes the exciton processes in the PTB7-Th phase at the interface between the photoactive layer and cathode modifying layer. The charge generation in the PTB7-Th phase in proximity to ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is more efficient than that close to ZnO or ZnO/PEIE, mostly because the FOIC interlayer suppresses the geminate recombination of the excitons in PTB7-Th diffusing towards the cathode modifying layer, via charge separation between PTB7-Th and FOIC. We also used other FREAs, such as IOIC2 (ref. 22) and IDIC (Fig. S9), as an interlayer in PTB7-Th:FOIC-based OSCs, whose performance was also improved (Table S3), demonstrating the universality of the FREAs playing a role of CML.

Fig. 6 shows the energy levels at the interface of ZnO/FOIC/PEIE and the photoactive layer. ZnO forms an ohmic contact with the FOIC interlayer, and PEIE enables ohmic contacts with the FOIC interlayer and photoactive layer due to the low work function of PEIE. Therefore, both electron extraction from the photoactive layer to the cathode and electron transport from the cathode to the photoactive layer take place efficiently, ensuring the occurrence of the mechanism proposed in Fig. 5.

In summary, we demonstrate new functions of FREAs in addition to being an acceptor in a photoactive layer, and use a FREA molecule, FOIC, as an interfacial layer in inverted OSCs. Compared with conventional ZnO and ZnO/PEIE, ZnO/FOIC/PEIE enhances the optical mode of the device and absorption of the active layer. FOIC reduces the geminate recombination in the adjacent polymer donor zone via the charge separation through the thin PEIE interlayer. FOIC passivates surface defects of ZnO and facilitates electron transport. The champion PCE of the OSCs based on ZnO/FOIC/PEIE is 13.04%, higher than that of the control devices based on ZnO and ZnO/PEIE (12.12–12.15%).
