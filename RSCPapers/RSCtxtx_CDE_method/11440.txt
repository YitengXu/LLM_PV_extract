A new two-dimensional (2D) organic small molecule, DCA3T(T-BDT), was designed and synthesized for solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs). DCA3T(T-BDT) exhibited a deep HOMO energy level (−5.37 eV) and good thermal stability. The morphologies of the DCA3T(T-BDT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) blends were investigated by atomic force microscopy and the crystallinity was explored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), respectively. The morphologies of the blends were strongly influenced by the blend ratio of DCA3T(T-BDT):PC61BM and annealing temperature. The effect of thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance of DCA3T(T-BDT)-based small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) was studied in detail. When DCA3T(T-BDT) was used as a donor with PC61BM as an acceptor, high efficiency SMOSCs with a power conversion efficiency of 7.93%, a high Voc of 0.95 V, Jsc of 11.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.70 were obtained by a thermal annealing process at only 60 °C, which offers obvious advantages for large scale production compared with solvent additive or interfacial modification treatment.

Over the past two decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) as a promising renewable energy source have attracted considerable attention of chemical, material and physical scientists because of their low cost, light weight, and large area fabrication on flexible substrates. At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs based on low band gap conjugated polymer is over 9% using an inverted device architecture. As an alternative candidate for polymer solar cells, small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have recently achieved great development, and PCE of over 8% have been realized through carefully modifying the molecular structure and using additives. Although PCE is still relatively lower than that of polymer solar cells, SMOSCs have a better prospect of industrialization due to their unique advantages of well-defined molecular structure, synthetic reproducibility, monodispersity, and convenient energy level control. Thus, further work on designing new small molecules and gaining a better understanding of the molecular structure-function relationships are needed for their future commercial applications.

Compared to their polymeric counterparts, in most cases, SMOSCs have relatively low fill factor (FF) and short circuit current density (Jsc) due to their poorer film formation ability and this has become the main hindrance for developing high performance devices. To date, conjugated organic small molecules with wide absorption, high hole mobility, as well as appropriate miscibility with the fullerene acceptor to form uniform interpenetrating networks were designed and synthesized for high efficiency SMOSCs. Among the vast variety of the developed electron-donating materials for OSCs, two-dimensional (2D) alkylthiophene substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been proved to be a promising material for photovoltaic applications. The incorporation of thiophene side chains could extend the vertical π–π conjugation and promote π–π stacking in the solid state. This extended conjugated structure is beneficial in improving charge transport and correspondingly achieve a high Jsc. Compared with a one-dimensional (1D) BDT-based conjugated polymer, the 2D BDT-based polymer generally represents a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the organic solar cell due to its lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. Hou et al. reported a series of copolymers based on 2D BDT derivatives, which showed excellent photovoltaic performance with PCEs of over 7%. Considering the great progress that has been achieved in polymer OSCs using 2D BDT derivatives, the 2D BDT unit is a promising donor material for SMOSCs. Therefore, novel small molecules with high efficiency would be designed and synthesized if the HOMO and LUMO levels of the 2D BDT-based small molecules could be effectively tuned by employing appropriate electron-withdrawing groups. On the other hand, a suitable method for fabricating the organic solar cells is also crucial for achieving high efficiency. Thermal annealing of BHJ films is one of the most widely used methods for improving the Jsc and FF of BHJ OSCs. However, as the thermal annealing temperature increases, the Voc of SMOSCs sometimes significantly decreases. Given the effect of thermal annealing on the morphology and crystallinity of the film, a delicate balance between Voc, Jsc and FF could be achieved by annealing at a low temperature, and a maximum PCE of solution-processed SMOSCs will be achieved.
In view of the aforementioned concerns, we have successfully synthesized a new solution-processed 2D-conjugated organic small molecule, DCA3T(T-BDT) (Scheme 1), with 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate units as the end-capped blocks and 4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene as the central core. BHJ OSCs were fabricated using a blend of DCA3T(T-BDT) as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor, with a single layer conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCA3T(T-BDT):PC61BM/Ca/Al. The best device exhibited a high PCE of 7.93% after thermal annealing at a low temperature of 60 °C for 10 min, with a high Voc of 0.95 V, Jsc of 11.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.70. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE for solution-processed SMOSCs without any solvent additive or interfacial modification treatment found in the conventional devices.

The detailed synthesis and characterization of DCA3T(T-BDT) are given in the experimental section (Scheme 2). The key precursor 7 was synthesized using a Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between 4′,4′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-trithiophene-5-carbaldehyde (5) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2yl-)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (6) in refluxing toluene under argon for 2 days. The target small molecule DCA3T(T-BDT) was obtained through the Knoevenagel condensation of intermediate 7 with 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate using triethylamine as the catalyst in anhydrous chloroform (CHCl3) for 40 h. The DCA3T(T-BDT) was fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, electrochemistry, high performance liquid chromatography with UV-detection (HPLC-UV), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and optical spectroscopy. DCA3T(T-BDT) possesses good solubility at room temperature in common organic solvents, such as toluene, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and CHCl3, due to eight solubilizing alkyl side chains.


TGA and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the thermal properties of the small molecule. As shown in Fig. 1, the TGA curve of DCA3T(T-BDT) indicates a good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperature with a 5% weight loss (Td) occurring at 389 °C under an nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal stability of DCA3T(T-BDT) is high enough to ensure the photovoltaic device fabrication. As shown in Fig. S2, the main melting endotherm occurs at 163.7 °C, and upon cooling DCA3T(T-BDT) exhibits a major crystallization exotherm at 133.5 °C, indicating that this small molecule has an obvious tendency to crystallize.


UV-vis absorption spectra of DCA3T(T-BDT) were investigated in CHCl3 solution and as a thin film, as shown in Fig. 2a. DCA3T(T-BDT) exhibited a broad absorption range covering 300–700 nm wavelengths in the solid state. In solution, DCA3T(T-BDT) has a maximal absorption (λmax) peak at 499 nm corresponding to the intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between D and A moieties. In comparison with its absorption spectrum in solution, the absorption spectrum of DCA3T(T-BDT) as a thin film shows a remarkable red-shifted λmax at 573 nm with a shoulder peak at 620 nm, indicating that a strong intermolecular π–π interaction exists in the solid state due to the improved planar construction of the 2D side chains. The optical band gap (Eoptg) value of DCA3T(T-BDT) is about 1.80 eV, which is deduced from the onset (690 nm) of absorption in the thin film.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the electronic structure and geometry of DCA3T(T-BDT), and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3. The electron density of HOMO was mainly delocalized over the central BDT core, and the electron density of the LUMO was concentrated on the 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate groups, demonstrating that an electron can transfer from the central BDT group to the end-capped blocks during an electronic excitation process. From the DFT calculations, the HOMO and LUMO energies of DCA3T(T-BDT) were found to be −4.98 eV and −2.82 eV, respectively. The electrochemical behavior of DCA3T(T-BDT) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 2b, the onset oxidation potential for the small molecule was 0.95 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The corresponding HOMO energy level of DCA3T(T-BDT) was determined to be −5.37 eV. The LUMO energy levels of DCA3T(T-BDT) was estimated to be around −3.42 eV from the onset reduction potential. This fairly suitable HOMO energy level conveys that a high Voc of SMOSCs based on DCA3T(T-BDT) blended with PC61BM could be expected. The LUMO energy level difference (>0.3 eV) between the donor and acceptor (PC61BM) is large enough for the separation of the excitons, which is very useful for increasing the short-circuit current in DCA3T(T-BDT)-based OSCs.

The high carrier charge mobility is important for effective photovoltaic active layer materials, which would facilitate charge exciton separation from the donor–acceptor interface, carrier transport to the electrodes and reduce recombination. The carrier charge mobility of DCA3T(T-BDT) was investigated by employing organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and vertical diodes. DCA3T(T-BDT) exhibited a typical p-type semiconductor behavior (Fig. 4), and the hole mobility was around 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, calculated according to the transfer characteristic curve. In the vertical direction, the hole mobility was measured by the space-charge limit current (SCLC) model with a typical device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCA3T(T-BDT)/Au. SCLC is described by the equation JSCLC = (9/8)ε0εrμh((V2)/(L3)), where J stands for current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μh is the hole mobility, V is the internal potential in the device and L is the thickness of the active layer. The hole mobility of DCA3T(T-BDT) was about 1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, calculated using the SCLC model (Fig. S4).


The BHJ solar cells with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCA3T(T-BDT):PC61BM/Ca/Al using PC61BM as the acceptor were fabricated to explore the photovoltaic performance of DCA3T(T-BDT). The detailed device fabrication and measurements are described in the experimental section. First, after thickness optimization, the relative ideal thickness of active layer was around 90 nm for DCA3T(T-BDT)-based OSCs. The effect of different D/A blend ratios on the performance of SMOSCs based on DCA3T(T-BDT) and PC61BM was investigated, and the corresponding results are collected in Table 1. With an increase of the D/A blend ratio from 1:1 to 4:1, Voc slightly increased, but Jsc and FF first increased and then gradually decreased. The optimized device made from the DCA3T(T-BDT) blended with PC61BM (3:1, w/w) shows the highest PCE of 7.19%, with a Voc of 0.97 V, Jsc of 11.22 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.66. The high Jsc could be partly ascribed to the better absorption of DCA3T(T-BDT) and the suitable energy matching and larger Voc agrees with its deeper HOMO energy level (−5.37 eV). The device performance is consistent with the morphologies of the films with different ratio, which are shown in the Fig. 6a–d. The domain in the films is gradually increasing with an increase in the D:A ratio, and the domain boundary is reduced. A good interpenetrating network could be formed at the ratio of 3:1 (D:A) with relatively low boundary density, which is in favor of the improvement of Jsc and FF.

To further improve the photovoltaic performance of SMOSCs based on DCA3T(T-BDT) and PC61BM, thermal annealing was employed. The device parameters with different annealing temperatures are summarized in Table 1. The performance of the devices were improved by thermal annealing with higher Jsc and FF compared to the devices as casted. The optimized device based on the DCA3T(T-BDT)/PC61BM (3:1, w/w) blend shows a PCE of 7.93%, Voc of 0.95 V, Jsc of 11.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.70 after thermal annealing at only 60 °C (Fig. 5a). The performance of the devices with different ratios could also be enhanced after annealing, as shown in the Table 1. Therefore, thermal annealing at relatively low temperature is a good method to improve the PCE of the devices and has obvious advantages for large scale production. It is worth noting that all the devices exhibited high Voc (0.94–0.98 V), which were almost insensitive to the annealed temperature and the D/A weight ratios. The J–V curves of the devices with different D/A blend ratios under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S3. As a result, DCA3T(T-BDT) would be a promising donor material for high efficiency SMOSCs.
The EQE curve of the optimized device covered a broad wavelength range of 310–700 nm with a maximum value of 70% at 569 nm as shown in Fig. 5b. After thermal annealing at 60 °C, the photoresponse is enhanced at the long wavelength region, which may be the contribution of improvement of the crystallization. Jsc calculated from the EQE curve is 11.34 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curve.

The enhanced device performance by the thermal annealing process at low temperature could be partially attributed to a better interpenetrating network. The morphologies of the films with the DCA3T(T-BDT):PC61BM (3:1, w/w) blend annealing at different temperatures are given in Fig. S5. The films after annealing show a lower root mean square compared to the pristine ones. Upon increasing the annealing temperature from 40 to 80 °C, the domain boundary intensity gradually reduced, which would decrease the trap state density existing in the boundary and therefore reduce the recombination current and improve the transport and collection of the carrier charge. This may also be an important reason for the improvement of Jsc and FF in this work. The morphologies of films with different D:A ratio after annealing at 60 °C are given in Fig. 6e–h. All films show a lower boundary intensity compared to their films as casted. Therefore, it is believed that thermal annealing at relatively low temperature may be an effective method to enhance the performance of devices by reducing the boundary intensity.

To further understand the performance difference of DCA3T(T-BDT)-based SMOSCs before and after thermal annealing at 60 °C, the crystallinity of the DCA3T(T-BDT) blend films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, the diffraction peak of the annealing film remained at the same position, and the intensity was obviously enhanced. Both of the films show an evident diffraction peak (100) at 2θ = 4.2°, corresponding to a d100-spacing value of 21.0 Å. The second-order diffraction peak (200) at 2θ = 8.4°, corresponding to a d200-spacing value of 10.5 Å was also clearly observed, indicating the high crystallinity of DCA3T(T-BDT) in the solid thin film. The stronger diffraction peak of the annealing film compared to the pristine one reveals that the low temperature annealing would improve the ordering in the donor phase. The 2D GIWAXS patterns also indicate a well-ordered crystal structure throughout the corresponding thin film. The high crystallinity could increase the carrier mobility, which would be benefit for the transport and collection of the carrier, thus leading to a higher Jsc and FF.

In conclusion, a new low band gap and 2D-conjugated organic small molecule, DCA3T(T-BDT), was designed and synthesized for solution-processed organic solar cells. DCA3T(T-BDT) exhibited good solubility, thermal stability, crystallinity and a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.37 eV. High efficiency small molecule organic solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 7.93%, a high Voc of 0.95 V, Jsc of 11.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.70 was obtained by thermal annealing process at only 60 °C. Hence, this encouraging result reveals a prospective strategy for a new 2D heterocyclic core in constructing donor–acceptor type small molecules for high performance organic solar cells.


All starting materials and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise mentioned. Toluene was distilled over sodium in the presence of benzophenone to remove water. CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 were distilled over calcium hydride (CaH2).


1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Advance III 600 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. High resolution mass spectra were recorded under APCI mode on a Bruker Maxis UHR TOF spectrometer. TGA and DSC were carried on SDT Q600 simultaneous DSC-TGA instrument and Perkin Elmer diamond differential scanning calorimeter, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were taken on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. Moreover, CV experiments were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode system using a platinum wire as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode. A solution of tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the internal standard (the energy level of Fc/Fc+ is −4.8 eV under vacuum) and the formal potential of Fc/Fc+ was measured as 0.38 V vs. SCE. HPLC-UV was carried on a Waters 1525 high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program suite at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to investigate the electronic structure of the molecule in the gas phase. All the alkyl side chains were replaced with methyl groups to reduce the computational cost. The optimized molecular structure was confirmed to be in a stable local minimum of the ground state potential energy surface by computing the vibrational frequencies at the same level of theory.
OFET was fabricated using n-type heavily doped Si as the gate with a 300 nm thermally oxidized SiO2 layer as the gate dielectric (the capacitance was 10 nF cm−2). The film was prepared by spin-coating the solution (6 mg mL−1 in CHCl3) on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-treated SiO2/Si. The Au source and drain electrodes were deposited on the film through a shadow mask with a length of 31 μm and a width of 273 μm. Measurements were performed using a 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer in air.

SMOSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT :PSS/DCA3T(T-BDT):PC61BM/Ca/Al using a conventional solution spin-coating process. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol under ultrasonication for 20 min. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated (4000 rpm, ca. 40 nm thick) onto the ITO surface. After being baked at 150 °C for 20 min, the substrates were transferred into a glove box. Subsequently, the active layer was spin-coated from different ratio blends of DCA3T(T-BDT) and PC61BM in CHCl3 solution at 1500 rpm for 25 s on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. Finally, a 10 nm Ca layer and 100 nm Al layer were successively deposited onto the active layer under high vacuum by a shadow mask to define the area of 0.1 cm2 (<3 × 10−4 Pa). The thermal annealing was carried out by placing the completed devices on a digitally controlled hotplate at different temperatures, in an argon-filled glove box.


The structure of the films was analyzed using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE). Surface morphological characterization of the films were carried out by a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were analyzed with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. Further, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.


All coupling reactions were conducted under purified argon and monitored by Merck silica-gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC). 2-(Tributylstannyl)-4-octylthiophene and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2yl-)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (6) were synthesized according to the literature procedures.
