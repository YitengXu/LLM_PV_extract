Interest in ternary blend organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has been triggered by improved power conversion efficiency (PCE), simple fabrication, and a variety of material combinations. They typically consist of a p-type donor, an n-type fullerene, and a secondary p-type donor, where the two donors undergo complementary photoabsorption to increase the photocurrent. In contrast to this general strategy, we have incorporated propeller-shaped, high-bandgap triptycene (TP) into a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composed of a conjugated polymer (P3HT, PTB7, and PffBT4T) and methano[60]fullerene (PCBM). The TP molecules self-organize into two-dimensional (2D) layers. Based on their energy levels, these layers are not expected to trap charge carriers. The performance of these OPV devices is discussed in conjunction with film morphology, transient photoconductivity, mobility, crystalline structure, and surface free energy. Herein, we demonstrate that the PCE of the crystalline polymer (PffBT4T):PCBM with 5 wt% TP is slightly improved (maximum: 9.41%, average: 8.96 ± 0.23%) without the use of a solvent additive, along with much enhanced long-term stability. This is presumably due to the presence of the TP sheet that acts as a nucleation agent and facilitates the crystallization of the polymer. The features of the TP scaffold give rise to a high-performance, additive-free ternary BHJ. Thus, further exploration through chemical functionalization of TP is warranted.

A bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) is a blend film of two carbon-based semiconductors that have different electronic natures: an electron-donating p-type and electron-accepting n-type. An appropriate energy offset of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) between the donor and acceptor allows for exciton splitting into charge carriers, reducing charge recombination, and transporting charges to the respective electrodes. This offers a sustainable system for harnessing solar energy.

The recent progress in material chemistry enables the use of polymers and molecules as both p- and n-type semiconductors, where the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPV devices reaches 10–11% for single and tandem cells. Tandem cell technology shows great potential as it covers a wide range of the solar spectrum and mitigates a trade-off between the bandgap and open circuit voltage (Voc). However, it necessitates a delicate, efficient interlayer and careful device engineering to match the short circuit current densities (Jsc) of the multiple layers. Due to simple fabrication and improved PCEs (mainly ascribed to an increased Jsc), the use of a ternary blend of single cells that is typically composed of a donor, an acceptor, and a secondary donor has gained much attention. The role of the secondary donor can be understood by three mechanisms: cascade, Förster energy transfer, and parallel linkage.
Despite the significant advance in ternary blend OPVs, difficulties in improving their PCEs still remain. The addition of a secondary donor frequently causes a decrease in Jsc and fill factor (FF) when the low-bandgap secondary donor is isolated in the primary donor or acceptor domain, which leads to charge trapping. Accordingly, the precise control over both energy alignment and morphology is of great importance in ternary blend BHJs. Meanwhile, the improvement of hole mobility by dilution of the p-type polymer in a high-bandgap semiconductor or insulating matrix has been reported. For example, field effect transistor (FET) hole mobility in a polymer alloy of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and polystyrene (PS) or polyethylene (PE) exhibits comparable or even higher values than pristine P3HT. Similar results have been observed for amorphous poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) diluted in high-bandgap host polymers of poly(vinylcarbazole) and PS. An insulator matrix is suggested to reduce the number of trapping sites and/or enhance the crystallinity of the guest polymer, regardless of the simultaneously decreased amount of charge transport sites. Although this dilution technique is advantageous in light emitting diodes, and increases tolerance against oxidation, the excessive incorporation of high-bandgap polymers into OPVs is detrimental to light absorption. Thus, the addition of a high-bandgap insulator as the third component of the BHJ has been relatively unexplored.
In this article, we report a ternary blend made up of a polymer donor, a fullerene acceptor (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM), and an insulating triptycene (TP) molecule (Fig. 1a). To date, several TP derivatives have been known to form a 2-dimensional (2D) nested hexagonal structure in crystals, or in liquid crystalline mesophases. Recently, Shoji, Fukushima et al. reported the synthesis of large-area, domain boundary-free organic films using TP derivatives such as tri(n-dodecyloxy) TP (TP-C12, Fig. 1a). These TPs can assemble into a well-defined “2D nested packing + 1D stacking” structure (Fig. 1b). In a polymer-fullerene BHJ, both the driving force for the formation of optimal nanometre-scaled morphology and the resultant efficient charge separation are linked in part to the difference in structural dimensionality and the self-assembling process; a 1D polymer backbone with peripheral alkyl chains can organize into lamellar crystallites through π–π stacking and side-chain interdigitation, while 3D fullerene forms aggregates capable of electron delocalization and isotropic electron transport. In the context of the structuring events in a polymer–fullerene BHJ, we were interested in the use of the unique TP 2D scaffold as the third component in a blend system containing a 1D polymer and 3D fullerene. In most BHJs, a solvent additive [such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)] is added into the solution. Thus, the additive molecules tend to remain in the blend film after spin-coating, which plays in some cases a pivotal role in the formation of moderate-sized donors, acceptors, and their mixed domains. However, the removal of the viscous, high-boiling point additive is a critical issue for mass-production and long-term stability. As the TP derivatives are non-volatile, they would render the optimal BHJ relevant to improved photoelectric conversion. Furthermore, due to their high-bandgap (4.2 eV) with a deep HOMO (−6.25 eV) and shallow LUMO (−2.02 eV), TPs are not expected to act as a charge trap (Fig. 1c and S1). Based on the above considerations, we performed transient photoconductivity measurements, surface observation, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and OPV device characterization of the ternary blends. Here we demonstrate how TP affects their morphology and electronic properties.


Fig. 2a displays flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) transients of the P3HT:PCBM:TP-C12 = 1:1:0–0.2 (w/w) ternary blend. The maximum φ∑μ transients (φ∑μmax, φ = charge generation yield per absorbed photon at the peak, ∑μ = sum of hole and electron mobility = μh + μe) increased by ∼30% upon mixing with 0.05 TP-C12, and decreased slightly after further addition of TP-C12 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, blending with insulating poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) resulted in a flat, or slightly decreasing dependence (Fig. S2). Subsequently, we fabricated normal-type OPV devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/Ca/Al, Fig. 2c). The Jsc improved slightly, within the experimental error range, from 8.77 ± 0.08 mA cm−2 (TP-C12 = 0) to 8.94 ± 0.17 mA cm−2 (TP-C12 = 0.05). However, the overall trend was a continuous decrease with the increase of TP-C12 content (Fig. 2d and Table 1). As a result, the PCEs were monotonically degraded from 3.53 ± 0.12% (reference sample, P3HT:PCBM = 1:1) to 3.35 ± 0.05% (TP-C12 = 0.05) and 2.55 ± 0.14% (TP-C12 = 0.2, Fig. 2d). The decrease in the FF (increase of series resistance Rs and decrease of parallel resistance Rp) is mostly responsible for the degradation (Table S1). The device performances are inconsistent with the TRMC results.

The surface morphologies of the P3HT:PCBM:TP-C12 = 1:1:x films were visualized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The height and phase images did not indicate any distinct phase separation in the ternary blends upon the addition of TP-C12 = 0–0.1 (Fig. 3a and b) and 0.15–0.20 (Fig. S3). In contrast, the XRD patterns (Fig. 3c) exhibited changes that normally accompany the gradual evolution of the TP-C12 (001) peak corresponding to an intersheet d-spacing of 23.9 Å (consistent with the literature, 24.3 Å in ref. 45), and the mostly unchanged P3HT (100) peak corresponding to an interchain d-spacing of 16.7 Å. The positions of these peaks were almost unaffected by the blend ratio, demonstrating that P3HT and TP-C12 are not mixed into a co-crystallized phase. While the correlation lengths of the TP-C12 crystallites, evaluated using the Scherrer equation, increased from 18.7 nm at TP-C12 = 0.05 to 30.7 nm at TP-C12 = 0.20, those of the P3HT crystallites exhibited a subtle, unusual behaviour. Thus, an increase from 15.0 nm at TP-C12 = 0 to 15.6 nm at TP-C12 = 0.05, followed by a decrease to 14.7 nm at TP-C12 = 0.15, was observed (Fig. 3d). The photoabsorption spectra of the ternary blends, normalized at their main peak at 515 nm, displayed a bell-shaped curve of the intensities of the vibronic absorption peak at 605 nm (Fig. 3e). Notably, the correlation length and intensity of the vibronic peaks associated with the degree of P3HT crystallinity were in line with the φ∑μmax value of the TRMC evaluation (Fig. 2b). This indicates that the incorporation of a small amount of TP-C12 improves the local hole mobility. The photoemission intensity of the ternary blends exhibited a parabolic dependence on the TP-C12 content (Fig. S4). This also supports the increase in the size of the P3HT crystallite because the large P3HT crystallites decrease the exciton diffusion yield to the donor–acceptor interface, leading to a small recovery of fluorescence intensity.
The surface free energies (SFEs) of P3HT, PCBM, and TP-C12 (23.7, 31.3, and 16.8 mJ m−2, respectively), were evaluated from the contact angle measurements with water and glycerol droplets (Fig. 4a). The order of the SFE (TP-C12 < P3HT < PCBM) implies that the TP-C12 molecules exist in the P3HT domain rather than the PCBM domain. The morphology of the ternary blend (Fig. 4b) was predicted from XRD, optical spectroscopy, and SFE data. It is likely that the 2D assemblies of TP-C12 are mainly located in the amorphous region of P3HT, or the mixed phase of P3HT:PCBM. In this case, TP-C12 may act as a nucleation agent, which facilitates the crystallization of pure P3HT domains, and enlarges the crystal size. This is further corroborated by the hole and electron mobilities evaluated from the space-charge limited current (SCLC) devices. As illustrated in Fig. 4c and listed in Table 2 (J–V and fitting curves are provided in Fig. S5), the SCLC hole mobilities (1.1 to 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) followed a trend similar to that observed in both the TRMC φ∑μmax value (Fig. 2b) and the XRD correlation length (Fig. 3d). This supports the cooperative organization of P3HT and TP-C12. On the other hand, after mixing the blend with TP-C12, the SCLC electron mobilities decreased from (1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at TP-C12 = 0 to (8.2 ± 1.1) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at TP-C12 = 0.15. The balance between the hole and electron mobilities is one of the crucial factors that influence the Jsc and FF. We ascribe the decrease in PCE to the degraded electron mobility. The C60 molecules have been reported to co-crystallize with non-substituted TP by intercalating into the free space of the three-blade TP, while we were unable to detect such a structure in the XRD experiments. Nevertheless, we assume that unfavourable changes in the morphology and purity of the PCBM aggregates should decrease the SCLC electron mobility (by ∼40%). In addition, since the TP has the lowest SFE in the components and thus tends to concentrate on the surface, a vertical segregation of the TP molecules that prevents electron collection at the Ca/Al cathode possibly occurs.

We further examined the ternary blends composed of TP-C12, PCBM, and a high-performance low-bandgap polymer [semi-crystalline thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene copolymer (PTB7) or highly crystalline difluorinated benzothiadiazole/quaterthiophene copolymer (PffBT4T)]. Previously, binary blends PTB7:PC71BM and PffBT4T:PC71BM have been reported to exhibit PCEs of 7–9% (ref. 57–59) and 9–10%, respectively. The TRMC evaluations revealed that the PTB7:PCBM:TP-C12 = 1:1.5:x ternary blends processed from chlorobenzene (CB) solutions exhibited an almost flat or decreased (by ∼20%) φ∑μmax (Fig. 5a and S6). In sharp contrast, the φ∑μmax values of the PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C12 = 1:1.2:x films processed from CB increased by ∼30% at TP-C12 = 0.05 (kinetic decays in Fig. S7). When the content of TP-C12 was increased, the values of φ∑μmax were slightly decreased, as observed for the ternary blends of P3HT:PCBM:TP-C12. Based on the fact that the ternary blends with crystalline donor polymers such as P3HT and PffBT4T showed better TRMC transients, we surmise that TP-C12 is more compatible with crystalline than semi-crystalline polymers. We also investigated the effect of DIO as a solvent additive, which is often used for the preparation of ternary blend active layers. When DIO (3 v/v%) was added to the CB solutions of the ternary blends, the resultant materials showed almost identical φ∑μmax values, irrespective of the content of TP-C12 (Fig. 5a and S6). Thus, DIO counteracts the effect of TP-C12 on the structuring events in the ternary blends.
We next explored a suitable alkyl chain length and its number (two or three) of the TP molecules by measuring their SFE. As shown in Fig. 5b, the SFE value of PffBT4T was 23.5 mJ m−2, which is comparable to that of TP-C6 (24.1 mJ m−2). On the other hand, the SFE value of TP-C′12 (21.2 mJ m−2) was lower than that of PffBT4T. These results indicate that TP-C6 is more miscible with PffBT4T than the other TPs (TP-C12 and TP-C′12). Moreover, the solubility of TP-C6 in CB is superior to that of TP-C12, which allows for high loading of this TP into the PffBT4T:PCBM mixture without excessive bulk phase segregation and aggregation on the surface of solid substrates. According to the TRMC profile of the PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6 = 1:1.2:x films (Fig. 5a), the φ∑μmax increased as the TP-C6 content was increased. We expected that the use of TP-C6 bearing short alkyl side chains would lead to the enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of the ternary blends of PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6.

Fig. 6a illustrates the J–V curves of the PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6 = 1:1.2:0–0.1 OPV devices processed from CB solutions. The averaged PCEs exhibited an increase, within the experimental error range, from 8.81 ± 0.21% at TP-C6 = 0 and 8.96 ± 0.23% at TP-C6 = 0.05 to 9.10 ± 0.12% at TP-C6 = 0.10 (Fig. 6b and Table 3). Notably, the use of TP-C6 = 0.05 resulted in a PCE value (9.41%) higher than those observed for the ternary blends with TP-C6 = 0 (9.24%) and TP-C6 = 0.10 (9.25%). Obviously, this is ascribed to the improved Jsc without any significant loss in the FF (Rs and Rp are listed in Table S2), which is consistent with the upward shift in the external quantum efficiency spectra (Fig. S8). The SCLC mobilities of holes (μh) and electrons (μe) were slightly decreased but almost comparable between TP-C6 = 0 [μh = (3.1 ± 0.4) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = (8.1 ± 3.6) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1] and TP-C6 = 0.05 [μh = (2.7 ± 0.3) × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = (5.4 ± 1.6) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1] (Fig. S9 and Table S3). The mobility balances (μh/μe) are mostly the same (0.26 for TP-C6 = 0 and 0.20 for TP-C6 = 0.05), which is relevant to the unchanged FF. The optoelectronic properties of the PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6 OPV device are in contrast to the case with P3HT:PCBM:TP-C12, where a large drop in the FF occurs (Table 1). We have examined the OPV devices of P3HT:PCBM:TP-C6; however, the average PCEs were decreased from 3.53 ± 0.12% (TP-C6 = 0) to 3.44 ± 0.13% (TP-C6 = 0.05) and 2.95 ± 0.10% (TP-C6 = 0.10), as shown in Fig. S10 and Table S4. The results are similar to the case of TP-C12 (Fig. 2d), where the slight increase in Jsc was observed at TP-C6 = 0.05, but the FF was monotonically degraded.

The XRD patterns of the ternary blends of PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6 showed diffraction peaks with d-spacings of 21.7 and 14.6 Å, which are assignable to the interchain (100) diffraction of PffBT4T and the intersheet (001) diffraction of TP-C6, respectively (Fig. 6c). The latter value is consistent with data from powder X-ray analysis using synchrotron radiation (14.8 Å, Fig. S11). Although the correlation lengths of the PffBT4T crystallites displayed a marginal decrease from 15.9 nm at TP-C6 = 0 and 0.05 to 15.1 nm at TP-C6 = 0.10, the peak intensities of the (100) diffraction increased linearly with the increase in the TP-C6 content (Fig. 6d). The AFM height images displayed a fibril-like feature of PffBT4T in the ternary blend, indicating highly crystalline nature of the PffBT4T domains (Fig. S12). These results suggest that TP-C6 improves the total crystallinity in the blend films and in turn contributes to the increase in Jsc and PCE.
The stability under pseudo-sunlight was examined for PffBT4T:PCBM. As shown in Fig. 6e, the device fabricated from CB with 3 v/v% DIO indicates a rapid degradation in the normalized PCE (74% decrease at 100 min), where all the device parameters, in particular Jsc, are decreased (Fig. S13 and Table S5). DIO molecules remaining in the active layer even after their removal in a vacuum may react with the polymer backbone, or increased temperature may degrade the optimal BHJ morphology (AFM could not distinguish the change). In stark contrast, the PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6 indicates a good stability (15% decrease at 100 min). The decrease in Jsc is responsible for the decreased PCE, while the other parameters (Voc and FF) remained mostly unchanged. These results corroborate the advantage of non-volatile and chemically/electronically stable TP molecules to improve PCE.
Chen et al. reported the ternary blend of the molecular BHJ of 7,7′-{4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl}, bis{6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5 yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole}p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, and PC71BM. In this blend, the incorporation of a 0.5 wt% block copolymer [PS-b-PEO, poly(ethylene oxide)] induced a slightly larger phase-separation in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, and increased the cluster size of PC71BM, leading to an increase in PCE. Deribew et al. also demonstrated that doping of the 7 wt% block copolymer P3HT-b-PI (polyisoprene) into P3HT:PCBM increased both Jsc and FF values. This was attributed to the increased crystallinity, as evidenced from photoabsorption and XRD evaluations. Another example has demonstrated that the presence of a high-bandgap PS resulted in the increase in the crystallinity of a donor polymer and PCBM. In contrast to the previous examples, we introduced a new type of small molecular dopant capable of forming a particular 2D assembly and achieved a high PCE (>9%) for the OPV device with PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6. Besides, our approach allows facile and fast film processing compared to the addition of DIO, which requires vigorous removal process in a high vacuum. Along with the unique 2D packing nature, TP can be functionalised with fullerene and other chromophores, thereby enabling the tuning of the HOMO/LUMO levels, dipole, and photophysical processes. We anticipate that a TP-based ternary blend could provide the impetus upon which evolution of OPV research will be found.

We have investigated the mixing behaviour of conjugated polymers, PCBM, and high-bandgap TPs and characterized the OPV devices of this ternary blend system. From the TRMC evaluation, we predicted the enhancement of the photoconductivity in the crystalline polymers (P3HT and PffBT4T) at a moderate loading of TP (∼5 wt%), while simple degradation was observed in the semi-crystalline polymer (PTB7). AFM, XRD, and SFE data suggested that the TP molecules were located in the polymer amorphous region and/or mixed phase of the polymer:PCBM without co-crystallization. The TP molecules self-organize into layered 2D sheets and may act as a nucleation agent that facilitates the crystallization of the polymer domains and enlarges the crystallites. Notably, the φ∑μmax values are correlated with the length of the P3HT crystallites and growth of vibronic absorption, which is further in line with SCLC hole mobilities. Although the ternary blends of P3HT:PCBM:TP-C12 resulted in the continuous decrease in the overall PCEs, mainly due to the decreased electron mobilities, the PffBT4T:PCBM:TP-C6 blends demonstrated the highest PCE (9.41%, average: 8.96 ± 0.23%) without the use of DIO. Notably, the TP-C6-containing device showed a much improved stability in comparison with that without TP-C6 processed from CB/DIO. This study proposes the possibility of controlling BHJ morphology, composed of a 1D polymer and 3D fullerene, by the incorporation of the self-assembling 2D TP motif. The versatility of the chemical modification of TP may offer an alternative way to improve the PCE of ternary blend OPVs.


Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT; >98% head-to-tail regioregularity), and PCBM (purity > 99.5%) were purchased from Aldrich and Frontier Carbon Inc., respectively. The compounds PTB7 and PffBT4T were purchased from 1-Material Inc.; solvents were purchased from Kishida Kagaku Corp. and used as received without further purification. The TP molecules (TP-C12, TP-C′12, and TP-C6) were synthesized and characterized according to our previous report. The details are given in the ESI.


UV-vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were performed using a Jasco V-730 UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a Jasco FP-8300 spectrometer, respectively. Powder XRD data were collected on a Rigaku RINT-2000 using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54187 Å) at room temperature. The correlation length (mean size) of the crystalline polymer was evaluated using the Scherrer equation:L ∼ 0.9λ(Δ2θcosθ)−1, where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, Δ2θ is the full width at half the maximum of the peak, and θ is the diffraction angle. The thickness of the film was measured using a Bruker Corp. model Dektak XT surface profiler. AFM measurements were performed using a Seiko Instruments Inc. (SII) Nanocute OP and Nanonavi II model. Contact angles (θ′) were measured using a NiCK Corp. LSE-ME2 model, and analysed using the Kaelble–Uy theory:γL(1 + cosθ′) = 2(γSdγLd)1/2 + 2(γSpγLp)1/2, where γL and γS are the SFE of the liquid and solid, respectively. The superscripts “d” and “p” represent the dispersion and polar components, respectively.


A film on a quartz substrate was set in a resonant cavity and probed by continuous microwaves at ∼9.1 GHz. The third harmonic generation (THG; 355 nm) of an Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Inc., Surelite II, 5–8 ns pulse duration, 10 Hz) was used as an excitation source (incident photon density, I0 = 4.6 × 1015 photons per cm2 per pulse). The photoconductivity transient Δσ was converted to the product of the quantum yield (φ) and the sum of the charge carrier mobilities, ∑μ (= μh + μe) by φ∑μ = Δσ(eI0Flight)−1, where e and FLight are the unit charge of a single electron and the correction (or filling) factor, respectively.


In a normal cell, a PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P AI 4083) layer was cast onto the cleaned ITO layer by spin-coating after passing through a 0.2 μm filter. The substrate was annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. An active layer was cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer, in a nitrogen glovebox, by spin-coating. A cathode consisting of 20 nm Ca and 100 nm Al layers was sequentially deposited through a shadow mask on top of the active layers by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber. The resulting device configuration was an ITO (120–160 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (45–60 nm)/active layer (∼200 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) with an active area of 7.1 mm2. In the inverted cell, a ZnO layer was fabricated onto a cleaned ITO layer by spin-coating with a ZnO precursor solution (0.1 g ml−1 zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.028 g ml−1 ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol). The substrate was annealed on a hot plate at 200 °C for 30 min. An active layer was cast on top of the ZnO layer in a nitrogen glovebox by spin-coating. An anode consisting of 10 nm MoOx and 100 nm Ag layers was sequentially deposited on top of the active layers, through a shadow mask, by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber. The resulting device configuration was an ITO (120–160 nm)/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoOx (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm) with an active area of 7.1 mm2. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a source-measurement unit (ADCMT Corp., 6241A) under AM 1.5 G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun, monitored by a calibrated standard cell, Bunko Keiki SM-250KD) from a 300 W solar simulator (SAN-EI Corp., XES-301S). The EQE spectra were measured by using a Bunko Keiki model BS-520BK equipped with a Keithley model 2401 source meter. The monochromated light power was calibrated by using a silicon photovoltaic cell, Bunko Keiki model S1337-1010BQ.


The SCLC device structures consisted of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer (∼200 nm)/Au for the hole, and an Al/active layer (∼200 nm)/LiF/Al for the electron. The other procedures are similar to those of the OPV device. The mobility was determined by fitting a J–V curve into the Mott–Gurney law, J = 9ε0εrμV2(8L3), where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the material, μ is the mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, and L is the thickness of the active layer.
