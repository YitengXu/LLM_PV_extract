Low cost and efficient processing are key factors to be considered for the future practical application of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a novel strategy for the fabrication of high performance inverted PSCs via a simple one-step coating of the mixture of an amino-functionalized n-type small molecule POF-N and the active layer to simultaneously form the active layer and cathode interlayer. Interestingly, the inverted device based on one-step coating yielded enhanced or comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) for fullerene, non-fullerene and polymeric acceptor based solar cells. The underlying mechanism was disclosed to be that POF-N preferred to aggregate closely on the indium tin oxide (ITO) surface during the coating process and served as the electron transport layer. Electron spin resonance spectra and space-charge-limited charge mobility tests showed that the electron mobility of the active layer was obviously enhanced due to the efficient doping interaction between POF-N and PC71BM. Consequently, the balanced charge transport contributed to the increased short-circuit current of the device. Our universal results, based on different systems, provide a promising device structure and design concept to reduce the cost of efficient PSCs.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention from researchers due to their unique advantages such as flexibility, low cost, large area and solution processability in a high throughput way. In the recent decade, high-performance PSCs have been developed through strategies including the molecular design of novel materials and the delicate optimization of device architectures and film morphologies. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction polymer solar cell have exceeded 14%, which is of great importance for the commercial applications of large-area roof-top solar cell in residential and commercial buildings. In order to finally achieve the ultimate commercial application goal, two important factors including acceptable cost and good device durability must be considered and solved. On one hand, simplification of the fabrication process of the devices is a promising strategy to save the cost and it is important for the high reproducibility of large area roll-to-roll industrial production. On the other hand, the device stability is highly related with the interface engineering of organic electronic devices. In the previous works on highly efficient polymer solar cells, multilayers including an active layer, hole and electron extract layers are indispensable in conventional or inverted device structures, in which the active layer is sandwiched between hole and electron extract layers. Compared to the conventional devices, the inverted devices exhibited higher stability in ambient condition due to the higher work function top electrode and none of acid corrosion of ITO from the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). To develop high performance inverted PSC device, organic and inorganic interlayers were widely applied between the photoactive layer and electrodes to modify the work function of electrode and form ideal ohmic contact in active layer/electrode interfaces. However, it is challenging to get a balance between the simplification of manufacturing process and the contribution of interlayer to enhance the PCEs.

Spontaneous vertical phase separation techniques, referred as one-step coating, were reported in several studies to deal with this obstacle. In this technique, the interfacial layer material was added to the active layer solution as an additive and deposited together with active layer. The additive self-assembled to the active layer/electrode interface after coating to generate the desired interlayer. In the case of inverted devices, the cathode interlayer with high surface energy spontaneously generate at the bottom active layer/ITO interface as the interlayer additive materials are usually rich of polar and highly hydrophilic groups such as oxides or amines. Several organic cathode interfacial materials, such as poly ethylenimine (PEI), poly[(9,9′-bis(30-(N,N′-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), were used as additives to dope in the active layer, however, the PCE of the one-step coating devices were lower than two-step coating devices. It is noteworthy that, for PEI and PFN, the insulating non-conjugated and p-type conjugated backbone are not beneficial to the electron transport. Moreover, the long molecular chain of polymeric interlayer may hinder its rapid and efficient migration from active layer to interface due to the molecular chain entanglement.
Herein, we have introduced an n-type small molecule POF-N (see Fig. 1) that contains multi-amino groups, into a series of active layers to fabricate inverted PSCs. This small molecule cathode interlayer material based on an electron-deficient conjugated backbone exhibited relatively good electron transport properties compared with the cathode interlayer materials with p-type backbone. Contact angle measurements and surface deep etching X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that POF-N migrated vertically to the bottom of the active layer and formed cathode interlayer between ITO and active layer. Additionally, electron spin resonance spectra (ESR) and space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements showed that the charge transfer and doping interaction between POF-N and PC71BM occurred and the electron mobility was significantly enhanced, which was propitious to balance the charge transport and extract. The one-step coating device achieved a PCE of 10.0% in fullerene polymer solar cells, while conventional two-step coating device achieved comparable PCE of 9.5%. We also fabricated non-fullerene inverted devices. The two-step coated device achieved high PCE of 10.2%, while the one-step coating device achieved comparable PCE of 10.0%. In case of the all polymer device, we achieved a PCE of 6.5% with one-step coating method while a PCE of 7.0% with two-step coating method was obtained. The one-step coating device achieved comparable device performance to the conventional two-step coating device in several BHJs system, demonstrating its feasibility in printed high performance PSCs. All the results demonstrated its promising potential application in transition to roll-to-roll compatible processing and large-scale production in future.

The one-step coating procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Molecule structures of the n-type molecular POF-N, conjugated polymer donors poly[[2,6-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]-dithio-phene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th), poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2c:4,5c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T), poly{4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-4,8-(thien-2-yl)-6-octyl-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)dione} (PTzBI), fullerene derivative acceptor [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methylester (PC71BM), non-fullerene acceptor 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) and polymer acceptor poly{[N,N-9-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200) are shown in Fig. 1b. To fabricate the one-step coating processed inverted PSCs, different ratios of POF-N were added into the active layers. We employed an inverted structure composed of ITO/POF-N: active layer/MoO3/Ag. POF-N: active layer mixed solution was directly spin-coated on the top of the ITO substrate. The traditional two-step coating inverted device with a structure composed of ITO/POF-N/active layer/MoO3/Ag. POF-N interlayer was spin coated on top of the ITO layer and then followed by the deposition of active layer on top. The thickness of the active layers were fixed at 95 ± 5 nm.

To find the optimal composition of the PSCs, we held the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend ratio at 1:1.6 by weight, and varied the ratio of POF-N:PTB7-Th (x:1). The PCEs of devices with different ratios of POF-N are shown in Table S1. The best performed one-step coating device was obtained with the optimum weight ratio of 1 wt% POF-N in PTB7-Th, showing a best PCE of 10.0%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.76 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 72%. With the doping ratio of POF-N increased from 1 wt% to 15 wt%, the Jsc of the devices slowly decreased from 18.3 mA cm−2 to 16.5 mA cm−2 and the PCEs decreased from 10.0% to 8.9%. We also tested the PCE of control device without POF-N and two-step coating device. The Voc of the control device without POF-N was only 0.31 V, which can be ascribed to the energy level miss match (as depicted in Fig. S1) between the work function of ITO and LUMO level of the PC71BM. Compared with one-step coating device, the two-step coating device showing the best PCE of 9.5% with a Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 73%. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2. These results can be ascribed to the vertical redistribution of POF-N from BHJ onto ITO via self-assembly (will be discussed later). More specifically, the POF-N interlayer formed on top of the ITO surface to facilitate the electron extraction and collection. The decreased performance of one-step coating devices with POF-N content increasing was suspected to be resulted from hole-trap owing to superfluous residual POF-N in the bulk of active layer. One-step coating devices with n-type polymer PNDI-2T and p-type polymer PFN as cathode interlayer materials were also tested, the results are shown in Table S2. These two polymer doped devices show relatively lower performance than POF-N doped device, indicating the n-type small molecule is more beneficial for the electron collection when working in one-step coating device. We also fabricated non-fullerene (PBDB-T:ITIC) and all-polymer (PTzBI:N2200) inverted devices (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The two-step coated device, with structure of ITO/POF-N/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag, achieved high PCE of 10.2%, while the one-step coating device ITO/BHJ:1%POF-N/MoO3/Ag achieved comparable PCE of 10.0%. For the all polymer device, we employed PTzBI:N2200 as the active layer and achieved a PCE of 6.5% with one-step coating method while a PCE of 7.0% with two-step coating method. The two-step coating processed devices with ZnO as interlayer were also fabricated. The device data are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the one-step coating devices show comparable performance to ZnO-based two-step coating devices. However, the one-step coating is much simpler than two-step coating in fabrication procedure.

To investigate the molecule distributions of the one-step coating active layers, films composed of active layer/POF-N were fabricated by coating the hybrid solution onto ITO, and analyzed by droplet contact angel and XPS. The water droplet contact angle on POF-N was 77.2°, close to value of pristine PC71BM (88.8°), whereas it showed 102.6°, 96.3° and 96.4° on the PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th:PC71BM and 1% POF-N doped PTB7-Th:PC71BM surfaces, respectively (Fig. S2). The contact angle of PTB7-Th:PC71BM with or without 1% POF-N nearly unchanged, illustrating that a small amount of POF-N molecules showed little influence on the molecule distribution of BHJ surface. The POF-N with polar functional groups may sink to the interior or bottom of the BHJ film during the spin coating process. To verify this vertical self-assembly structure, etching XPS was conducted (Fig. 3). Considering that the sulfur atom exclusively corresponds to PTB7-Th, since there is an absence of sulfur atoms in PC71BM, the signal of S2p with binding energy of 164 eV is used as a probe to estimate the molecular distribution of PTB7-Th. As shown in Fig. 3a, the signal of S2p decrease gradually with the increase of etching layer which means that PTB7-Th is rich at the surface. Oxygen atoms exists in all components, but with different chemical environment and thus different binding energy. The binding energy of phenyl ether bond is 532.9 eV, which represents POF-N, and 529.9 eV is the signal of O1s in ester group which exists among the three components. The peak of the O1s singly shifted from 529.9 eV to 532.9 eV, proving that the POF-N was self-assembled at the bottom of the film. The signal of N1s, with binding energy of 398.4 eV, is used to solely estimate distribution of POF-N. The peak of N1s gradually increased with etching layer also proved that POF-N was self-assembled at the bottom of the film. Cross-sectional TEM-EDX was also used to confirm the self-assemble of POF-N on ITO surface. Considering the low content of POF-N, the elemental mapping analysis was based on the architecture of ITO/5%POF-N:PTB7-Th:PC71BM, the results are shown in Fig. S3. The nitrogen mapping picture shows that N element is mainly detected close to ITO, which clearly verifies that POF-N interlayer form on top of the ITO surface.
The film topographies of BHJ and POF-N doped BHJ were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and are shown in Fig. 4. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of BHJ, POF-N (1 wt%) doped BHJ films were 1.41 nm and 1.45 nm respectively. The comparable RMS values of the BHJ and POF-N (1 wt%):BHJ films indicating that doping a tiny amount (1 wt%) of POF-N into BHJ has negligible influence on the film roughness. There was no apparent difference in the TEM images between the BHJ and POF-N doped BHJ. The AFM images of POF-N doped PBDB-T:ITIC and PTzBI:N2200 were tested and are shown in Fig. S4. The one-step coating processed films have nearly the same morphology as the two-step coating processed films in both PBDB-T:ITIC and PTzBI:N2200. These results showed that one-step coating device has nearly the same morphology of the two-step coating.
To better understand the influence of POF-N on the active layer properties, the work function of ITO was measured by scanning kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM), and the work function of ITO was reduced from 4.8 eV to 4.29 eV by the coating of POF-N, which can be ascribed to the dipole formation between POF-N and ITO. The work function of ITO coated with 10 nm PTB7-Th:PC71BM, with different ratio of POF-N, were also cross checked by ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS), the results are showed in Table S3. With the doping ratio of POF-N increasing from 1% to 15% in PTB7-Th:PC71BM, the WF of the ITO also gradually decrease. Therefore, ohmic contact between active layer and ITO substrate can be expected, which facilitate the extraction of electrons. Furthermore, the electron and hole mobilities were investigated by SCLC methods. Electron-only devices based on the architectures of ITO/Al/PTB7-Th:PC71BM (w/o 1%POF-N)/Al and hole-only devices based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM (w/o 1% POF-N)/MoO3/Ag were prepared. The mobility data calculated from the SCLC curves are shown in Table S4 and Fig. S5, the electron mobility of the pristine active layer and doped active layer were 3.0 × 10−4 and 7.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The increased electron mobility can be ascribed to the doping between POF-N and PC71BM since a few reports have suggested that amines and ammonium salts may possibly n-dope fullerenes to enhance its conductivity. Moreover, the improved electron mobility maybe due to the removal of surface traps on PC71BM through n-doping, or the PCBM stack more closely after doping, which are both beneficial for the electron hopping. The hole mobility was 4.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the active layer and 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the 1 wt% POF-N doped active layer. As a result, the imbalance between hole mobility and electron mobility decreased from 14.9 to 1.86, indicating that the charge transport were more balanced in one-step coating device compared with the normal two-step coating device, therefore inducing the higher Jsc and FF. The electron mobility of both PBDB-T:ITIC and PTzBI:N2200 doped with or without 1% POF-N were also checked by using SCLC model. The data are summarized in Table S4. It can be seen that there is no difference for PBDB-T:ITIC before or after doping. However, there is a decrease in PTzBI:N2200 after doping. It may due to that POF-N hinder the molecular packing of N2200 at the ITO/active layer interface, which is in consistent with the low PCE improvement in POF-N doped PTzBI:N2200 device. To verify the n-doping of POF-N on the PCBM, the ESR spectroscopy study was performed and showed in Fig. 5. The sample was composed of POF-N doped PC71BM (1:160 by weight), where pure POF-N and PC71BM were tested as comparisons, all samples were studied in darkness. We first investigated the sole component of PC71BM, no ESR signal was detected. In contrast, very weak ESR signal from the unpaired electron in POF-N was observed, revealing that self-doping may occur in POF-N. However, in the blended sample, the ESR signal intensity increased by 5 times with the same magnetic field shift. This result clearly suggested that efficient electron transfer occurred from the amine groups on the side chain of the POF-N to PC71BM. These results, from both the SCLC and ESR studies provide evidence that the amine groups of ETLs could n-dope PC71BM at the BHJ/ETL interface, and leading to enhanced electron extraction and PSC device performance. In the case of PBDB-T:ITIC and PTzBI:N2200, there are no apparent doping signals from POF-N to ITIC and N2200 in ESR measurements (as shown in Fig. S6), which should be the reason for relatively low PCE improvements in these devices when comparing with PTB7-Th:PC71BM device. However, these devices still show comparable performance to their two-step coating devices, demonstrating the universality of one-step coating in PSCs.

In summary, an n-type small molecule POF-N was doped to active layer to fabricate efficient inverted PSCs. When employed PTB7-Th:PC71BM as active layer, a PCE of 10.0% and a Jsc of 18.3 mA cm−2 are obtained at the optimum 1 wt% POF-N doping ratio, representing the highest device performance of polymeric solar cells with this type of device structure achieved to date. Molecular distributions were studied by etching XPS which confirmed that POF-N self-assembled between ITO and active layer and acted as cathode interlayer. Moreover, the charge transfer between POF-N and PC71BM improved the electron mobility of the device, consequently the balanced charge transport improved the Jsc of PSCs. Moreover, PCE of 10.0% and 6.5% were obtained in non-fullerene PBDB-T:ITIC and all polymer PTzBI:N2200 inverted devices, respectively. Our inspiring results provide an efficient approach for the large scale fabrication of PSCs with readily process and reduced cost. The further investigation of the device durability and PCE based on one step coating strategy are under progress in our group.
