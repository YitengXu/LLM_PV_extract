MXenes, a newly interesting family of two-dimensional (2D) materials, have recently attracted wide attention owing to their unique photoelectric properties. In this study, 2D Ti3C2Tx, a classic representative of the MXene family, is fabricated and functioned as a hole transport layer (HTL) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to its features of outstanding metallic conductivity, excellent optical transparency, suitable work function, and superior mechanical properties. The Ti3C2Tx nanosheets deposited from neutral solutions are incorporated between the photoactive layer and the anode electrode as HTLs to facilitate charge transport and collection characteristics in PSCs. The results show that the Ti3C2Tx film possesses good light transmission and high conductivity. The photovoltaic characteristics of the Ti3C2Tx-based devices are systematically investigated. It is demonstrated that the incorporation of Ti3C2Tx as a HTL endows PSCs with superior charge extraction capability, exhibiting a significantly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.53% than that of the only ITO-based device (4.21%) with PBDB-T as the donor and ITIC as the acceptor. Such photovoltaic performance also outperforms that of the state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS-based devices (10.11%). Furthermore, the Ti3C2Tx-based device also shows better long-term stability under atmospheric conditions without any encapsulation than the PEDOT:PSS devices, which indicates that the 2D Ti3C2Tx material possesses great potential in PSCs.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention for their potential applications as low-cost and large-area fabrication renewable energy devices. Considerable efforts concerning new light-harvesting material development, microstructure morphology control and interface engineering have been devoted to promoting single-junction-bulk-heterojunction PSC performances with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 15%. The interface layer, as the pivotal component of a PSC, plays an important role in the overall device efficiency and long-term stability. To further increase the performance of PSCs, the interface materials should minimize the energy barriers to facilitate charge extraction, as well as restrain charge recombination at the interfaces between the anode/cathode electrodes and the active layer. The interface layer is usually divided into an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL), which are used for collecting electrons and holes, respectively. At present, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as a HTL in optoelectronic devices for its good electrical properties and excellent solution processability. However, the intrinsic disadvantages of the PEDOT:PSS layer such as being hygroscopic and highly acidic, morphological and electrical inhomogeneity, and inferior electron blocking ability are detrimental to the efficiency and long-term stability of PSCs. Therefore, developing new hole transport materials to substitute for PEDOT:PSS in optoelectronic devices is highly required.

One promising strategy to replace PEDOT:PSS is developed by employing high work function and good optically transparent inorganic semiconductors such as NiO, V2O5, MoO3, WO3 and RuO2. The resulting devices based on these metal oxide HTLs are demonstrated to exhibit comparable PCE and improved long-term stability than PEDOT:PSS devices. However, most of these metal oxide HTLs are fabricated via a complicated vacuum-based deposition step, which is incompatible with the large-scale roll-to-roll process. Recently, 2D nanosheet materials, with the features of large specific surface area, atomic thickness, and tunable electronic structures, have been triggering tremendous interest as a promising alternative to PEDOT:PSS. Graphene oxide (GO), as a member of 2D materials, is promising as a hole transport layer owing to its superior electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. Triggered by this, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring and probing other superior 2D materials, such as metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheets, black phosphorus, and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
In 2011, Gogotsi et al. first reported a novel kind of 2D layered transition metal carbide designated as MXene with the formula of Mn+1XnTx, which received increasing research interest. MXenes are normally produced via selectively etching the A layer (mainly a group IIIA or IVA element) from Mn+1AXx phases (n = 1, 2, or 3), where M is an early transition metal and X is C and/or N. Among the newly-discovered MXenes, Ti3C2Tx (Tx: –O–, –OH and –F) as a typical representative has drawn great attention owing to its distinguished properties including outstanding electronic conductivity (2.0 × 104 S cm−1), excellent optical transparency, high mobility (1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1), and high charge carrier density (3.8 × 1022 cm−3). Moreover, the uniform surface-terminating groups endow Ti3C2Tx with great potential to be chemically functionalized, making it a promising material for wide applications in lithium-ion batteries, transparent electrodes, super capacitors, and solar cells. For instance, Ouyang and co-workers reported the tunability of the work function of Ti3C2Tx MXenes by UV-ozone and/or hydrazine treatments and the applications of these MXenes as efficient electron or hole-collection buffer materials for non-fullerene OSCs based on PBDB-T:ITIC blends. Such buffer materials can exhibit high photovoltaic efficiency, revealing the great potential of MXenes in solar cell applications. A facilely fabricated Ti3C2Tx hole transport layer and its enhancement effects in charge carrier transfer and collection properties are therefore highly required to increase the performance and stability of PSCs.
Herein, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets deposited from neutral solutions are fabricated and utilized as a hole transport layer in PBDB-T:ITIC devices based on three factors: (i) the superior electrical conductivity and mobility of Ti3C2Tx would boost the charge extraction capacity of PSCs; (ii) different from the PEDOT:PSS thin film, the Ti3C2Tx layer precipitated from neutral solutions without eroding both the active layer and ITO substrate, thus can endow PSCs with increased PCE and reinforced stability; and (iii) the remarkably enhanced hydrophobicity of the Ti3C2Tx layer compared to that of the PEDOT:PSS film alters the photoactive layer morphology and enables an intimate contact between the interface layer and photoactive layer, therefore boosting the hole transport and reducing the charge recombination. The microstructures, physicochemical properties, and charge transport and collection properties of the Ti3C2Tx thin films are investigated in detail. Synchronously, the influence of the Ti3C2Tx layer on the long-term stability of devices is evaluated systematically.

Aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios P VP AI 4083, a weight ratio of 1:6) was purchased from H.C. Starck. Ti3AlC2 powders (200 mesh; purity >98 wt%) were obtained from Beijing Jinhezhi Materials Co., Ltd. Lithium fluoride (LiF) was provided by Aladdin. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was purchased from Kewei Chemistry Co., Ltd. Poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T), 3,9-bis(2-methylene(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno-[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC), and (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide) (PFN-Br) were supplied by Luminescent Technology, Inc. Chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. All reagents and solvents were employed as received. De-ionized (DI) water was used in the whole experiment.


Ti3C2Tx was fabricated by selectively etching the Al layer from Ti3AlC2 as follows. To start with, 1 g of LiF was dispersed in 20 mL, 6 M HCl solution in a Teflon beaker under stirring for 5 min to completely dissolve the salt. Afterwards, 1 g of Ti3AlC2 powders was slowly added over the course of 15 min to avert initial excessive heating of the mixture and stirred at 35 °C for 24 h. After etching, the resulting solution was repeatedly washed with deionized water under centrifugation with a speed of 3500 rpm for 5 min several times until the pH of the suspension was >6. After decantation of the suspension, a clay-like precipitate was obtained. Deionized water was added to the resultant sediment with ultrasonication under an Ar atmosphere for 60 min to exfoliate Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. At last, the supernatant was centrifuged with a speed of 3500 rpm for 5 min to obtain small Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. The concentration of the as-prepared Ti3C2Tx solution was ∼0.8 mg mL−1. Scheme S1 (ESI) exhibits a schematic illustration of the fabrication procedure.


All devices with the structure of ITO/hole transport layer (Ti3C2Tx, PEDOT:PSS or no hole transport layer)/PBDB-T:ITIC/PFN-Br/Al were fabricated on precleaned ITO coated glass substrates. Here, PFN-Br was chosen as the buffer layer due to its suitable band alignment. ITO substrates with a thickness of ∼280 nm and a sheet resistance of ∼10 Ω sq−1 were cleaned by sequential sonication in detergent aqueous solution, acetone, deionized water, alcohol, and isopropanol, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. Then, the Ti3C2Tx solution with a concentration of 0.3 mg mL−1 was spin-coated onto the UV/O3-treated ITO substrates and dried at 120 °C for 30 min. Considering the poor transmittance of the thicker Ti3C2Tx film, Ti3C2Tx uniform thin films with four different thicknesses of ∼1.5, ∼3, ∼6, and ∼15 nm, measured by AFM under tapping mode scan, were deposited by varying the spin-coated speeds from 600 to 3500 rpm for 40 s (Scheme S2, ESI). The PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer with an optimized thickness of 37 nm was spin-coated onto the precleaned ITO substrate with a speed of 3000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 30 min (Table S1, ESI). To fabricate the PBDB-T:ITIC photoactive layer on each HTL, the PBDB-T:ITIC blend was fully dissolved in the mixture of chlorobenzene and DIO (99.5:0.5 volume ratio) with a polymer weight concentration of 10 mg mL−1, and vigorous stirring at 70 °C for 12 h in a N2 filled glovebox. After filtration with a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter, active layers were prepared onto the HTLs by spin-coating the BHJ solution at 2500 rpm for 60 s inside the glovebox and then thermally annealing at 100 °C for 15 min in the glovebox. The thicknesses of the active layers were estimated to be 100 nm as probed by an alpha-step surface profiler. Then, PFN-Br was spin-coated atop the active layer. Finally, the Al (100 nm) layer was thermally evaporated onto the photoactive layer through a shadow mask in a vacuum <10−6 Torr.


The morphologies and microstructures of the fabricated Ti3C2Tx and HTLs were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO1530VP), and elemental mapping analysis of Ti3C2Tx was performed on the same equipment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) was used to characterize the morphology of Ti3C2Tx. The existence of oxygen functional groups was examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Bruker VERTEX 70) with a wavelength of 4000–400 cm−1. The crystalline structure of Ti3C2Tx was probed by wide X-ray diffractometry (WXRD, RigakuD/max2500v/Pc) (CuK 40 kV, 200 mV) at a rate of 2 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of Ti3C2Tx was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA-50 SHIMADZU) under the flow of nitrogen operating from 30 to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1. The compositional and chemical bond analysis of Ti3C2Tx was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with monochromated Al-Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) at a pressure of 2 × 10−9 Torr. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of different HTLs and photoactive layers were recorded using a Bruker Multi Mode 8 scanning probe microscope (SPM, VEECO) under the tapping mode. The conductivities of PEDOT:PSS and Ti3C2Tx films were tested by the van der Pauw four-probe conductivity technique (Keithley 2400 source). The surface properties of the HTLs were determined using a FACE (model OCA40 Micro, Germany) with water as the test liquid at room temperature. The UV-vis transmittance of the as-prepared HTLs was detected using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (HP 8453). The work function measurements of the HTLs were carried out using a scanning Kelvin probe (KP Technology SKP5050). The work function of Ti3C2Tx was determined by measuring the contact potential difference (CPD) of the Au reference probe with the Au sample (we designate it as CPD1), and CPD of the Au reference probe with the Ti3C2Tx sample (designate it as CPD2). In the test, the probe distance was regulated via the software of the Kelvin probe system. We exported the raw data and obtained CPD1 and CPD2, and then plotted CPD versus point as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI). The fluorescence spectra (PL) of the PBDB-T films with different thicknesses of Ti3C2Tx layers and PEDOT:PSS as HTLs were measured using an automated spectrofluorometer (SPEX 1681) with an excitation wavelength of 500 nm.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices were detected using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Normalized PCE-time analyses of solar cells were recorded using the same instrumental setup. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with a commercial EQE test system (Enlitech, QE-R).

Ti3C2Tx is prepared via selectively etching the Al layer from the Ti3AlC2 phase in the mixture of hydrochloric acid and lithium fluoride solution as depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI). It can be seen that the compact Ti3AlC2 (see Fig. 1a) is etched to a layered and loosely packed accordion-like architecture with the lateral size ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers (Fig. 1b). Upon sonication-assisted exfoliation as shown in Fig. 1c and d, Ti3C2Tx is delaminated into single-layered nanosheets with a thickness of 1.5 nm, in accordance with the previous report. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern presented in the inset of Fig. 1c indicates a hexagonal structure. Moreover, the Tyndall effect in the as-fabricated Ti3C2Tx solution is distinctly observed (Fig. S1, ESI). The nanostructure is subsequently detected by XRD (see Fig. 1e). The disappearance of the characteristic peak of Ti3AlC2 at 2θ = 39° and the shift of (002) and (004) peaks to lower angles indicate that Ti3AlC2 is successfully etched to Ti3C2Tx and the layer spacing along the c axis is enlarged, in agreement with the results in the literature. The chemical composition of Ti3C2Tx is probed by XPS in Fig. 1f. The existence of signals belonging to O 1s (21.7%) and F 1s (3.8%) indicates that Ti3C2Tx is terminated by –O–, –OH, and –F groups. The FITR spectrum of Ti3C2Tx (see Fig. S2, ESI) displays two obvious peaks at 1641 and 3448 cm−1 assigned to the stretching vibrations of CO and –OH, respectively. Furthermore, these terminated functional groups are uniformly distributed on the surface of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets as confirmed by EDS in Fig. S3 (ESI). The TGA curve indicates that Ti3C2Tx exhibits superior thermal stability (Fig. S4, ESI).


For PSCs, the surface morphologies of the HTLs have pivotal effects on the electrical properties of devices such as the shunt resistance (Rsh) and the series resistance (Rs). Herein, the AFM topography images of ITO substrates and Ti3C2Tx thin films of four different thicknesses spin-coated on ITO substrates from their 0.3 mg mL−1 aqueous solutions are shown in Fig. S5a–e (ESI). The average thicknesses of the thin films are estimated to be ∼1.5, ∼3, ∼6 and ∼15 nm with the corresponding surface roughnesses of 0.82, 1.05, 1.10 and 1.18 nm, respectively, which are smaller than that of the bare ITO surface (3.04 nm), suggesting that the deposition of Ti3C2Tx results in planarization of the rough anode surface. The conductivities of PEDOT:PSS and Ti3C2Tx films are tested by the van der Pauw four-probe conductivity technique, and the measurement data are listed in Table S2 (ESI). As can be seen, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and Ti3C2Tx films is 0.0068 and 4035.61 S cm−1, respectively, indicating the great potential of Ti3C2Tx in facilitating the charge carrier transport and collection.

The optical characteristics of the HTLs are critical for the design of PSCs as the incident light is absorbed by the active layer through the transport layer on ITO. The transmittance of bare ITO and Ti3C2Tx films with different thicknesses spin-coated on ITO substrates are measured to better evaluate the transmission properties of Ti3C2Tx layers in PSCs and are plotted in Fig. 2a. All of the HTLs display high transmittance values of up to 89.23%, which allows sufficient solar light to transmit the HTLs. Furthermore, the transmittance is gradually decreased with the increase of the thickness of the Ti3C2Tx films, and the transmittance values of the Ti3C2Tx films continuously decrease from 89.23% to 83.43% as the thickness increases from 1.5 nm to 15 nm.
To assess the hole extraction abilities of various HTLs, the PL characteristics of the PBDB-T absorber layer spin-coated on ITO only, ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/Ti3C2Tx are tested. The PL quenching originates from hole extraction across the PBDB-T/HTL interface. The PL signal at about 665 nm is assigned to the emission from PBDB-T. As illustrated in Fig. 2b, ITO only exhibits a strong PL spectrum with a peak at 665 nm, indicating that the ability to collect holes of ITO only is less effective, thus more carrier recombination occurs in this device. By contrast, a clear reduction in the peak intensity is detected for Ti3C2Tx-based films, indicating that the hole transmissions between PBDB-T and Ti3C2Tx films are significantly promoted. This is most likely due to the enhanced conductivity and suitable band alignment of the Ti3C2Tx-based films. Synchronously, Ti3C2Tx (3 nm) possesses the strongest quenching ability from PBDB-T, which enables the efficient transfer of holes generated in the photoactive layer to the HTL and suppresses carrier recombination.
Also important is the hydrophobic property of the hole transport layer; Ti3C2Tx (3 nm) is chosen as the representative to determine water contact angle, as depicted in Fig. 3a–c. ITO only and hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS films display contact angles of 29.8° and 10.3°, respectively. In contrast, the Ti3C2Tx (3 nm) thin film is demonstrated to be more hydrophobic than PEDOT:PSS with a larger contact angle of 46.5°. This remarkably enhanced hydrophobicity enables an intimate contact between the HTL and photoactive layer, therefore promoting the hole transport and reducing the contact resistance. Since the Ti3C2Tx (3 nm) film exhibits a distinct hydrophobicity from the PEDOT:PSS layer, it might exert an influence on the micromorphology of the PBDB-T:ITIC active layer, as verified by AFM (Fig. 3d–f). The PBDB-T:ITIC thin film on ITO only and PEDOT:PSS layers possesses surface roughness values of 1.64 and 2.41 nm, respectively. By comparison, the PBDB-T:ITIC thin film on Ti3C2Tx (3 nm) has a distinctly reduced surface roughness of 1.27 nm coupled with a favorable microphase separation, which allows the charge separation and extraction process to be facilitated. All the peculiarities depicted above indicate that Ti3C2Tx should be an engaging HTL for highly efficient photovoltaic devices.

To evaluate the effect of Ti3C2Tx as a HTL, we selected PBDB-T:ITIC as the light-absorbing layer, and bare ITO, ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/Ti3C2Tx as the anodes. The structures of these devices are presented as follow:

A. ITO/PBDB-T:ITIC/PFN-Br/Al
B. ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC/PFN-Br/Al
C. ITO/Ti3C2Tx/PBDB-T:ITIC/PFN-Br/Al

Fig. 4 and Fig. S7 (ESI) show the chemical structures of PBDB-T, ITIC, and PFN-Br, and schematic structures and energy level diagrams of the as-fabricated devices, in which the band energies of ITO, PBDB-T, ITIC, PFN-Br, and Al layers are well established, while the band level of Ti3C2Tx is based on the Kelvin probe.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the as-prepared devices under illumination and in the dark are collected and shown in Fig. 5a and b, and the corresponding short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), PCE, Rsh and Rs resistances are summarized in Table 1. The corresponding histogram of PCE counts for 24 devices is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI). As can be seen, the PCE of device A with ITO-only as the HTL is 4.21 ± 0.06% with low Jsc (13.63 mA cm−2), Voc (0.75 V) and FF (41.23%). By comparison, devices with Ti3C2Tx acquire notably higher performance, and a PCE as high as 10.53 ± 0.13% is obtained by Ti3C2Tx (3 nm) device D with a Jsc of 17.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V, and a FF of 67.06%, which is 4% higher than that of the-state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS buffered device B (10.11 ± 0.11%). Furthermore, a slight reduction in PCE with increasing Ti3C2Tx layer thickness can be detected. For example, the FF decreased from 67.06% to 58.45% as the film thickness increased from 3 nm to 15 nm, resulting in the decrease of PCE from 10.53 ± 0.13% to 9.20 ± 0.08%. This is reasonably due to the fact that thick films (i.e., 15 nm) exhibit slightly lower transmittance and increased serial resistance, similar to the results in other literature studies. It should be noted that, with a further decrease in the thickness of the Ti3C2Tx layer (i.e., 1.5 nm) by increasing the spin-coating speed, both the Jsc and FF of the device decrease significantly, which is most likely due to the poor Ohmic contact caused by the poor morphology of the Ti3C2Tx film (e.g., defects, voids). Meanwhile, the major photovoltaic enhancement of the Ti3C2Tx-based devices compared to the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based device B derives from the increased Jsc (16.14 vs. 17.89 mA cm−2), which is in good agreement with the higher EQE value of the Ti3C2Tx-based devices than that of PEDOT:PSS device B (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5b shows the dark current density of the devices, which indicates the reduced leakage current density and enhanced Rsh of the Ti3C2Tx based devices.

As mentioned above, the major performance enhancement of the Ti3C2Tx-based devices compared to the PEDOT:PSS-based devices originates from the improved Jsc, which is strongly dependent on the charge collection and charge recombination processes. Hence photogenerated current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) is plotted in double logarithmic coordinates. The Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.Fig. 6a reveals that Jph displays a strong dependence on Veff and is not fully saturated at Veff = 2 V for the ITO-based device. By contrast, for PEDOT:PSS and Ti3C2Tx-based devices, Jph reaches the saturation state at Veff = 2 V, suggesting that almost all the photogenerated free charge carriers are transported and collected at the electrodes. Moreover, the Jph/Jsat ratios, used to judge the overall charge collection efficiency under short-circuit or maximal power output conditions, are tested and summarized in Table 2. Benefiting from the favorable micromorphology and microphase separation of PBDB-T:ITIC on the Ti3C2Tx layer compared to those of PBDB-T:ITIC on the ITO substrate and PEDOT:PSS layer, the photogenerated exciton dissociation and extraction process was facilitated. The Jph/Jsat values under short circuit conditions are 94.1%, 95.2%, 94.9%, and 93.2% for Ti3C2Tx (1.5 nm), Ti3C2Tx (3 nm), Ti3C2Tx (6 nm), and Ti3C2Tx (15 nm) devices, respectively. The relatively high Jph/Jsat value of 95.2% indicates the efficient dissociation of excitons into charge carriers and charge carrier collection in Ti3C2Tx (3 nm) PSCs. In addition, Ti3C2Tx-based devices have larger shunt resistances (2765.93 vs. 1810.49 Ω cm2 for ITO-based devices) and smaller series resistances (4.03 vs. 18.04 Ω cm2 for ITO-based devices) than those for the ITO-based devices, indicating the formation of an improved Ohmic contact for Ti3C2Tx-based devices.

To probe the charge recombination behavior in PSCs, the J–V characteristics are tested at different light intensities (P) from 5 to 100 mW cm−2. It is generally recognized that Jsc dependence on P can be described by the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Pα, where the power-law exponent α reflects the extent of bimolecular recombination. The α value is more close to 1, indicating that more dissociative charges can be swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination. As presented in Fig. 6b, an only ITO-based device has an α value of 0.939. By comparison, Ti3C2Tx-based PSCs exhibit higher α values in the range of 0.958–0.984, indicating that bimolecular recombination is obviously suppressed in these devices. Meanwhile, it can be found that the Ti3C2Tx (3 nm)-based device exhibits the maximum α value of 0.984, whereas the PEDOT:PSS-based device exhibits 0.971. The higher α value is consistent with the increased Jsc of the Ti3C2Tx (3 nm)-based device compared to that of the PEDOT:PSS device. Further investigation of the recombination mechanism in the as-fabricated PSCs is conducted by plotting Voc as a function of P. In solar cells, Voc displays a linear dependence on ln(P) with a slope of nkBTq−1, where n is an ideality factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. The value of n reflects the dominant types of recombination in the device. Bimolecular recombination becomes dominant when the value of n is equal to 1. While trap-assisted (Shockley–Read–Hall or SRH) recombination engendered by interfacial defects and/or impurities in interfacial materials is involved, the Voc should be strongly dependent on P with a larger slope than kBTq−1 (less than 2kBTq−1). As illustrated in Fig. 6c the ITO only device attains a slope of 1.44kBTq−1, suggesting that its Voc value is strongly dependent on light intensity, which is reasonably ascribed to trap-assisted recombination created by the trap states of the ITO substrates and bimolecular recombination. In marked contrast, Ti3C2Tx-based devices display much smaller slopes of 1.27kBTq−1, 1.17kBTq−1, 1.23 kBTq−1, and 1.32kBTq−1 for Ti3C2Tx (1.5 nm), Ti3C2Tx (3 nm), Ti3C2Tx (6 nm), and Ti3C2Tx (15 nm) devices, respectively. This indicates that Voc values are less dependent on light intensity, profiting from the trap states of the ITO substrates being passivated by the dense and smooth Ti3C2Tx thin films, agreeing well with the observations in AFM.

Long-term stability is another crucial parameter apart from PCE, which strongly affects the commercialization of PSCs. Thus, the air stabilities of the PEDOT:PSS and Ti3C2Tx-based PSCs without any encapsulation are characterized and depicted in Fig. 6d. It could be found that the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS-based device exhibits a sharp degradation and drops to ∼0% after exposure to the atmosphere for 12 h. This is because the acidic and hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS etches the ITO substrate and causes the diffusion of indium into the PEDOT:PSS layer, and water molecules penetrate into the PEDOT:PSS film, which is detrimental to the long-term stability. By contrast, Ti3C2Tx-based PSCs display superior stability, keeping 62% of the initial PCE after 12 h. The neutral property of the Ti3C2Tx thin film should be responsible for such stability, avoiding the corrosion of PEDOT:PSS toward ITO substrates and active layers. Furthermore, the PCE of the Ti3C2Tx-based device still displays 53% of the initial PCE after 45 h, which indicates that Ti3C2Tx serves as a more stable HTL than the state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS layer and is expected to be a novel interfacial material with high-performance and superior stability for optoelectronic devices.


In summary, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are fabricated and employed as a HTL for the enhancement of photovoltaic characteristics. Herein, the Ti3C2Tx thin films deposited from neutral solutions are incorporated between the photoactive layer and ITO coated glass substrates to explore their potential in charge transport and collection properties in conventional PSCs. An obvious enhancement of PCE emerges on Ti3C2Tx-based devices by the uniform Ti3C2Tx films compared with only ITO-based devices; the higher performance also outperforms that of the state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS-based devices (10.53% vs. 10.11%). Such outperformances should be ascribed to the following factors: (i) energy level alignment allows facilitation of hole transmission, (ii) the outstanding metallic conductivity of Ti3C2Tx boosts the charge extraction in Ti3C2Tx devices, and (iii) the remarkably enhanced hydrophobicity alters the photoactive layer morphology and enables intimate contact between the interface layer and active layer, thus improving the hole transport and reducing the contact resistance. These traits accelerate charge transport and extraction, yielding superior photovoltaic performance. More importantly, the enhancement in the long-term stability of Ti3C2Tx devices is also observed under atmospheric conditions, which shows that Ti3C2Tx has great potential in PSCs.
