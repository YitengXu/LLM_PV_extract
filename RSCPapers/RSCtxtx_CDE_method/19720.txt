In planar n–i–p perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs), interfacial engineering plays a critically important role in charge extraction and transportation, and hence influences the photovoltaic performances. In this study, high performance Pero-SCs were realized by introducing SnO2/2D TiS2 double structures as electron transport layers (ETLs). The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached 21.73% (average PCE is 20.48 ± 0.50%) with quite small hysteresis. The improvement of performance is mainly attributed to the facilitated charge transportation due to the match of energy levels and decreased electron trap state densities of ETL films. This work provides not only a promising interfacial material, but also a feasible clue to alleviate the trap states of SnO2 in planar n–i–p Pero-SCs.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) exhibit great potential for commercial applications due to their simple processing techniques, low-cost fabrication procedures and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). For n–i–p Pero-SCs, PCEs higher than 20% were mostly achieved by using mesoporous TiO2 as electron transporting layers (ETLs). The preparation of mesoporous TiO2 usually involves high-temperature sintering, which may limit its application in Pero-SCs, especially flexible Pero-SCs, due to the complicated fabrication and high energy consumption.

Many efforts have been made to explore low-temperature and solution-processable ETLs. ZnO and TiO2 prepared by a sol–gel method do not need high-temperature processing, and showed good electron transportation properties in planar n–i–p Pero-SCs. Both of them are reported to cause decomposition of the perovskite thin films (Pero-TFs) present near them. In addition, hysteresis is also a problem in using TiO2 as ETLs.
Apart from ZnO and TiO2, SnO2 is also regarded as a promising alternative for ETLs, due to its advantages, such as a high mobility (240 cm2 V−1 s−1), wide bandgap (3.8 eV) and deep conduction band. The problem is that the devices using SnO2 as the ETL inevitably suffer from large hysteresis. Doping metal ions (yttrium or lithium), graphene quantum dots or graphene in SnO2 is proven to be an effective method to suppress hysteresis, where the precise dosage control can be a problem. A buffering layer of fullerene or fullerene derivatives between SnO2 and Pero-TFs is also reported to suppress hysteresis and improve the electron transportation. These materials either require thermal deposition in a vacuum chamber or are hard to avoid the solvent orthogonality problems, since the polar solvents used for the preparation of Pero-TFs, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), will dissolve the thin films.
In this study, we introduced a thin layer of 2D TiS2 atop SnO2, and used the double-layered structure as ETLs in planar n–i–p Pero-SCs. The hysteresis of the Pero-SCs was effectively suppressed, and more importantly an efficiency as high as 21.73% was achieved. This PCE is close to the record efficiency of Pero-SCs. The performance improvement could be explained by the facilitated charge transportation from the perovskite to the cathode due to the passivation of defect traps of SnO2 and better match of energy levels between the ETL and perovskite active layer.

Water-soluble 2D TiS2 was prepared through an ultrasonication enhanced lithium intercalation method. The exfoliated TiS2 was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and compared with bulk TiS2. As shown in Fig. 1a, the diffraction pattern of the bulk TiS2 is in accordance with the standard peaks shown in the XRD pdf cards (JCPDS card no. 88-1967). After exfoliation, only the (001) diffraction remains, which means that the bulk structure has been broken, and possibly 2D TiS2 has been produced. The formation of 2D TiS2 was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 1b, sheet-like nanostructures were observed, representing 2D TiS2. The AFM image also shows a similar structure and size, and one of the advantages of AFM observation is determination of the thickness of the nanosheets. Using depth analysis, we were able to learn that the most probable thickness of the 2D structures is 3.9 nm. This result agrees with the literature that the lithium-intercalation method can produce few-layered 2D TiS2.

The SnO2 film was prepared by a sol–gel method, and the water-soluble 2D TiS2 was spin-coated on the SnO2 layer. The 2D TiS2 did not cause observable differences in the transparency of ITO substrates with SnO2, as shown by the transmittance spectra shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI. To investigate the surface morphology and coverage of 2D TiS2, the film was prepared on a silicon wafer because of its smooth surface and observed by AFM. As shown in Fig. S2, 2D TiS2 formed discrete island structures for the films prepared with the concentration used to prepare the Pero-SCs. The coverage calculated by the analysis software was 85.1%. The average thickness of the film determined using an ellipsometer was ∼5 nm for the optimal conditions. Interestingly, upon addition of 2D TiS2, the conductivity of the whole film was greatly improved as indicated by conductive AFM (c-AFM) shown in Fig. S3a & b. This point can also be verified by the conductivity (σ0) determined using electron-only devices. For this purpose, devices with the structure of ITO/SnO2 (or SnO2/2D TiS2)/Al were fabricated, and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured in the dark. As shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI, the σ0 was determined from the slope of the J–V curves according to σ0 = JdV−1, where d is the thickness of the film. The σ0 values of SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 were ∼4.5 × 10−6 and ∼7.2 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. The improved conductivity of SnO2/2D TiS2 should result from the good electrical conductivity of 2D TiS2.
To further understand the change of electrical properties, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to obtain the trap densities and carrier mobility. In doing so, electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/SnO2 (or SnO2/2D TiS2)/PC61BM/Al were fabricated. As shown in Fig. 2, the turning point of the slopes in the J–V curve correlates to the trap-filled limit, where all the defects are occupied by charge carriers. The defect density (Ndefects) is calculated according to eqn (1):
(1)
where
L is the thickness of the film, ε (=12.5) is the relative dielectric constant of SnO2, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity and VTFL is the trap-filled voltage. The Ndefects values of SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 were 7.1 × 1016 and 4.4 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. It is clear that upon introduction of 2D TiS2, the Ndefects value was greatly reduced. When operating in the trap-free SCLC regime, the current can be extrapolated (Fig. 2) using the Mott–Gurney law (eqn (2)):

(2)
where
μ is the apparent charge carrier mobility and Vapp is the applied voltage. The electron mobility of the SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 films can be attained through eqn (2). The electron mobilities of SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 were 2.1 × 10−4 and 3.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These results indicate that modifying SnO2 with 2D TiS2 can passivate the surface defects of the SnO2 film, and improve the electron transportation ability.

In the following, these two kinds of films were applied in planar n–i–p Pero-SCs with a configuration of ITO/SnO2 (or SnO2/2D TiS2)/Pero-TFs/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (Spiro-OMeTAD: 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluoren). Fig. 3a is a representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a Pero-SC section. The thickness of the SnO2 was controlled to ∼20 nm. The Pero-TF atop ETLs was prepared by a two-step deposition method and the thickness was controlled to ∼380 nm. A layer of Spiro-OMeTAD (∼170 nm) was capped on Pero-TFs as a hole transportation layer (HTL). Through varying the thickness of the 2D TiS2 films, the optimized thickness was selected as 5 nm according to the PCEs. The J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 in the ESI, respectively. Fig. 3b shows the energy level diagram. The work functions (WFs) of ITO, ITO/SnO2 and ITO/SnO2/2D TiS2 films were determined using a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) with highly oriented pyrolytic graphite as a reference. The detailed data obtained from the KPFM are presented in Fig. S6 in the ESI. The WFs of ITO/SnO2 and ITO/SnO2/2D TiS2 are 4.68 eV and 4.63 eV, respectively. The energy levels of perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD referred to the literature. Addition of a 2D TiS2 layer between SnO2 and Pero-TFs resulted in a smaller energy difference between the ETL and perovskite (conduction band, 4.36 eV). The decreased energy offset between Pero-TFs and ETL allows better electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETLs, and reduces the charge accumulation at the interface.

Fig. 3c shows the J–V curves of the Pero-SCs using SnO2 or SnO2/2D TiS2 as ETLs, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The Pero-SCs based on SnO2 showed a summit PCE of 19.65%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.39 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 73.9% in the reverse scan (from 1.2 V to 0 V, RS) direction. It is clearly shown in Fig. 3c that the curves obtained from forward scan (from 0 V to 1.2 V, FS) and RS had a big difference. When using SnO2/2D TiS2 as the ETL, the maximum PCE of the Pero-SCs reached 21.73%, with a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 24.57 mA cm−2, and a FF of 79.4%. The calculated Jsc from integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 3d) spectrum was 23.42 mA cm−2, close to the Jsc from the J–V curves, suggesting a reliable measurement in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is so far the highest efficiency among the planar Pero-SCs. Apart from the improvement of PCE, hysteresis was also greatly suppressed, which was reflected by the J–V curves from FS and RS. In addition, the J–V curves (Fig. S7) with different delay times were also investigated. The results indicate that a long delay time corresponds to a low power conversion efficiency. However, for the devices scanned with the same delay time, the hysteresis is rather small.

Reproducibility was analyzed from 25 cells. As shown in Fig. 3e, the most probable PCE of Pero-SCs with SnO2/2D TiS2 as the ETL is much higher than that with SnO2 as the ETL. The average PCEs were 20.48 ± 0.50%. In addition, the time dependent PCEs of Pero-SCs based on SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 were measured under constant voltages of 0.86 V and 0.92 V, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3f, PCEs of 18.46% and 21.23% for devices with SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 as ETLs were achieved, respectively, in good agreement with the average PCEs obtained from the average values of FS and RS.
For the Pero-SCs with a 2D TiS2 layer, the improvement of PCEs is mainly due to the increase of Voc and FF. The enhanced Voc may result from the reduced WF after insertion of 2D TiS2 (as previously discussed in this study). The improvement of FF can be explained by the improved charge extraction ability of the ETLs, which can be proven using the photocurrent density–effective voltage (Jph–Veff) plots. Fig. 4a presents the Jph–Veff plots in double-logarithmic coordinates. Jph is determined using the equation Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is calculated from the equation Veff = V0 − V, where V is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0.Jph showed a linear increase as Veff < 0.1 V, and then reached a plateau afterward. All through this detection range, the Pero-SCs based on SnO2/2D TiS2 showed higher Jph, especially as Veff < 0.1 V, indicating that the SnO2/2D TiS2 double layers have greater charge extraction ability, which provides a rational explanation for the enhanced FF.
To systematically investigate the effect of 2D TiS2 on the performance of the Pero-SCs, a series of tests were carried out. (1) J–V curves in the dark. As shown in Fig. 4b, the linear parts were fitted with the Shockley diode equation (eqn (3))
(3)
where
J0 is the reverse saturation current density, JD is the dark current density, V is the applied bias, q is the electron charge, KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and n is the ideal factor of the real diode. For the two groups of devices, n and J0 are listed in Table S3. The values of [n, J0] were [2.18, 6.6 × 10−10 mA cm−2] and [2.47, 6.5 × 10−9 mA cm−2] for the Pero-SCs based on SnO2/2D TiS2 and SnO2, respectively. The smaller n and J0 suggests a decreased charge recombination at the interface between SnO2/2D TiS2 and perovskite. The result also provides good explanation to the improvement of Voc and FF upon introduction of 2D TiS2.

(2) Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The measurement was conducted in the dark near the respective Voc values, and the corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4c. The curves were fitted with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4c, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table S4 in the ESI. The semi-circles in the high/low frequency ranges are assigned to the transport resistance (Rtr) and the recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively. Upon addition of the 2D TiS2 layer, Rtr decreased dramatically from 45.9 to 17.4 Ω, and Rrec increased from 52.9 to 111.1 Ω. Both the variations indicate a more efficient charge extraction and transport.
(3) Steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL). As shown in Fig. 4d, the PL intensity got much weaker upon insertion of the 2D TiS2 layer. Note that the quality of the Pero-TFs was controlled to be the same, which is calibrated by UV-vis spectra and XRD patterns as shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI. The results indicate that the 2D TiS2 layer facilitated the electron extraction and transport towards the ITO electrode. The transient PL spectra were measured and are shown in Fig. 4e. The curves were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, which includes a fast (lifetime τ1, weight fraction f1) and a slow (lifetime τ2, weight fraction f2) component, corresponding to the quenching of photogeneration of free carriers of perovskite through charge transportation from the perovskite to the ETLs and electrode and the process of radiative recombination in Pero-TFs, respectively. The fitted parameters are summarized in Table S5. Upon addition of 2D TiS2, [τ1, f1] changed from [16.6 ns, 22.2%] to [11.6 ns, 29.1%]. The shortened τ1 and increased f1 both indicate more efficient charge extraction and transportation.
(4) Hysteresis interpreted by capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics. The C–V characteristics were obtained from EIS measurements, as shown in Fig. 4f. High capacitance at the interfaces is usually caused by the electron trap states, which delocalizes charge carriers. Upon addition of the 2D TiS2 layer, the capacitance at voltages varying from −1.5 to 1.0 V was dramatically reduced. The reduced capacitance implies that the trap states should be effectively passivated by the addition of the 2D TiS2 layer. These results provide a good explanation to the suppressed hysteresis of the Pero-SCs.
The surface component of the interlayers has a great effect on charge dissociation and transportation. Fitting of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results (XPS, Fig. 5a) shows two peaks located at 169.5 eV and 168.3 eV, corresponding to S 2p from sulfate groups (SO42−). Due to the chemical affinity of Pb for SO42− groups, a possible mechanism of bonding between SO42− on 2D TiS2 and Pero-TFs was proposed and a schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 5b. The Pb–O–S–Ti bond should be responsible for the reduction of the trap densities at the interface, thus leading to suppressed hysteresis.
In addition to the PCE, storage stability of the Pero-SCs was also investigated. All the Pero-SCs tested were not encapsulated and stored in dry air (10% relative humidity). As shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI, Pero-SCs with either SnO2 or SnO2/2D TiS2 as ETLs showed good storage stability, and the average PCEs remained 87.2% and 92.0% after 800 h, respectively. These results indicate that 2D TiS2 also contributed to the stability of the Pero-SCs.

SnCl2·2H2O was bought from Sigma-Aldrich. The butyllithium solution (2.4 mol L−1) in hexane (Amethyst Chemicals) was bought from J&K Technology Co., Ltd. The bulk TiS2 and PbI2 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium chloride (MACl) and Spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.


2D TiS2 was synthesized following the previous literature. Firstly, 0.3 g of bulk TiS2 was added into a two-necked flask and the equipment was degassed three times to ensure complete removal of oxygen. Under the protection of nitrogen, 7.42 mL of butyllithium solution in hexane was injected into the flask. Lithium intercalation in TiS2 was carried out under ultrasonic conditions at ∼18 °C for 3 hours. The flask was then removed from the ultrasonic bath and kept still for about 30 minutes. The upper layer of the mixture was removed. Then, 10 mL of de-aerated deionized water was added into the flask to react violently with lithium ions for 30 min. 10 mL of ethanol was introduced into the suspension and the mixture was centrifuged at 9500 rpm for 5 min. After the supernatant was removed, 10 mL of ethanol was added to the precipitate. The suspension was centrifuged at 9500 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was removed again. The residue was dispersed with 10 mL of deionized water and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the 2D TiS2 aqueous solution.


SnO2 films were prepared by spin-coating 11 mg mL−1 precursor solution of SnCl2·2H2O in ethanol on pre-cleaned ITO substrates at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s. The SnO2 thin films were annealed in air at 180 °C for 60 min, and then treated with UV-ozone for 30 min. The water-soluble 2D TiS2 with different concentrations was spin-coated on SnO2 films at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then the substrates were dried in a vacuum at room temperature.

The Pero-SCs were fabricated by a two-step deposition method. Firstly, 1.3 mol L−1 PbI2 dissolved in DMF/DMSO (9.5:0.5 by volume) was stirred at 70 °C for 12 h. The warm PbI2 was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s, then a drop of the mixed solution containing FAI:MABr:MACl (60 mg:6 mg:6 mg) in 1 mL isopropanol was added on the spinning substrate for 30 s. The as-prepared samples were annealed at 150 °C for 15 min under 30–40% relative humidity conditions. 50.61 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD was mixed with 20.2 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 12.25 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) stock solution (520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) and 0.7 mL of chlorobenzene. The above solution was spin-coated atop Pero-TFs at 3500 rpm for 30 s as the HTL. Finally, 100 nm of Ag was deposited by thermal evaporation.

XRD data were collected on a D2 PHASER diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Bruker, Germany). TEM images were obtained on a FEI Tecnai F20 (FEI company, United States) with an operating voltage of 200 kV. AFM images were captured using a MultiMode 8 microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) with peak force quantitative nanomechanical mode in air. The transmittance of SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 atop ITO, and the absorption spectra of Pero-TFs on different ETLs were collected on Cary 5000 (Agilent Technologies). The WFs of ITO modified with SnO2 and SnO2/2D TiS2 were measured using a KPFM in air. C-AFM using TUNA mode was carried out with a bias voltage of 0.5 V. The J–V curves of Pero-SCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter in a glove box filled with nitrogen. The measurement was conducted under AM 1.5G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in RS at a speed of 2 V s−1. A shadow mask was attached to the substrate to define an active area of 7.57 mm2. The EQE curves were measured by using a solar cell spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, QE-R3011) in air. The Nyquist plots were measured on an IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany) in the dark with a bias near the respective Voc of individual cells. The measurements of PL spectra were conducted on FLS980. For transient PL spectra, LifeSpec II monitored the signal intensity of Pero-TFs on different ETLs at 790 nm, excited using a 477 nm laser. The chemical elements were determined by XPS (Escalab 250Xi, Thermo).


In summary, water-soluble 2D TiS2 was prepared and applied as an interlayer between SnO2 and Pero-TFs in planar n–i–p Pero-SCs. The double-layered SnO2/2D TiS2 ETL greatly improved the electron transportation ability, and thus we were able to achieve a PCE as high as 21.73% for the Pero-SCs. In addition, the hysteresis was also effectively suppressed. The improvement of the device performance is mainly attributed to two aspects: (1) better alignment of energy levels due to insertion of 2D TiS2; (2) passivation of the trap states in the interlayers by the formation of bonds between 2D TiS2 and perovskite via the interfacial SO42− groups.
