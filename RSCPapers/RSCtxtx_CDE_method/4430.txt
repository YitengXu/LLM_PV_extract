Semitransparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs) have become novel photovoltaic technologies because of their extensive applications such as in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV); however, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still lagging behind that of opaque PSCs mainly due to insufficient light harvesting. Herein, we demonstrated high-efficiency ST-PSCs by controlling the optical Tamm state (OTS) formed at the interface between thin silver (Ag) electrodes and extra added layer (EAL)/one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs). The transmission groove of Ag/EAL/1DPCs was gradually red-shifted and broadened by tuning the position and intensity of the OTS; this resulted in a PCE as high as 9.36 ± 0.16% and an average visible transmission (AVT) of 14.31 ± 0.65% in the visible range along with tailor-made color. Simulation results obtained by transfer matrix modeling (TMM) demonstrated that the photoelectric field intensity could be redistributed by controlling the OTS; this led to an enhancement in the absorption of the ST-PSCs. We believe that the light management method of controlling the OTS can have the significant promise to speed up the commercial applications of colorized ST-PSCs in BIPVs.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the unique advantages of flexibility, lightweight and low-cost are promising devices for energy conversion application. Recently, via a new polymer material design and structural engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has already reached a breakthrough value of 14%; PSCs are the energetic members of the photovoltaic league, and their one unique feature is the possibility of semitransparent manufacture. Semitransparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs) can be easily fabricated using transparent electrodes. By combining light transparency and light-to-electricity conversion, the ST-PSCs exhibit appealing extensive applications in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), aesthetic architectures or power generating windows. Previously, many attempts have been made to achieve high-efficiency ST-PSCs by overcoming the trade-off between transparency and light absorption; however, to date, the reported efficiencies are not high enough to render ST-PSCs for commercial applications. Moreover, one barrier in achieving higher efficiency is that the solar photons are not completely absorbed in the active layer because of insufficient electrode reflection, which is a big issue impeding the further research on ST-PSCs. To maintain high efficiency and transmission, some efforts have been devoted to the development of high-transparency electrodes such as metal nanostructures, graphene, and conducting polymers. Moreover, significant efforts have been contributed to the synthesis of photovoltaic materials such as polymer donors, near-infrared fullerene-free acceptors, and transparent buffer layers. Among these, fused octacylic (FOIC) is a kind of most efficient acceptor material to date, which has firstly contributed an efficiency of 10.3% to ST-PSCs based on an enhanced near-infrared absorption spectrum; in addition to these efforts, light management methods have been applied to achieve high-performance ST-PSCs based on the physical optics induced novel optical structure design. Moreover, device engineering has been employed to optimize both efficiency and transmission using microcavity structures, dielectric mirrors and plasmonic metal nanostructures.

Dielectric mirrors, such as one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs)/distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), can solve the trade-off of efficiency and transmission for the ST-PSCs device because of their strong ability to manage the photons. Within the photonic forbidden band, the 1DPCs can reflect all the photons back for re-absorption and then increase the device efficiency. Moreover, photons within the passband can transmit to the devices and enable improved average visible transmission. In 2012, our group has proposed and demonstrated that 1DPCs can perfectly compromise the trade-off of the ST-PSC devices by constructing DBR in terms of absorption spectrum of active layers. After this, the 1DPCs have been widely used to tune the absorption and transmission spectrum of ST-PSCs. In 2017, Li et al. fabricated inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based ST-PSCs with 1DPCs, exhibiting a PCE of 7.0% with an average visible transmission (AVT) of 12.2%. In terms of the design, 1DPCs act as a reflector and enable the light lying in the bandgap to be reflected back to the device and then be efficiently absorbed, thereby increasing the light absorption. However, the differences in the refractive indices of the two layers in the 1DPCs determine the bandwidth of the photonic bandgap, which is relatively narrow as compared to the absorption spectrum and results in energy loss that has been previously reported. Moreover, the reflection spectrum of photonic crystals becomes narrower along with increments in the photonic crystal period, leading to a narrower external quantum efficiency spectrum and loss of electricity.
Recently, the optical Tamm state (OTS), generated and confined at the interface between a noble metal layer and 1DPCs as DBR, was discovered, and it provided an alternative to the standard surface plasmons. These electromagnetic modes can be produced by direct optical excitation for light with both TE and TM polarizations; this offers a promising platform for light management. Therefore, the rational utilization of OTS in PSCs is a promising approach for light harvesting based on the properties of surface wave without the assistance of nanoparticles or nanopatterned structures. Zhang et al. reported the potential applications of OTS in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and constructed a photonic crystal as a dielectric mirror with periodically alternating layers of ITO and antimony tin oxide (ATO). As a result, the overall absorption exhibited an enhancement of 35% when compared with that of the optimized conventional planar OPVs. However, the study only focused on device simulation and the fabrication processes of ITO and ATO were extremely energy intensive; moreover, ITO and ATO were hardly achieved by evaporation in lab.
To date, many efforts have been devoted to achieve ST-PSCs based on 1DPCs with significantly enhanced efficiency and transmission. However, the intrinsically existing OTS between metal electrodes and 1DPCs is usually neglected, resulting in energy loss and having broad space for efficiency improvement of ST-PSCs. In this study, OTS was introduced into ST-PSCs for the first time to systemically improve the device performance. The 1DPCs formed using WO3 and LiF were fabricated on thin Ag electrodes, leading to the formation of a sharp OTS effect. By controlling the thickness of the interlayer materials between Ag and 1DPCs, the reflection dip of the OTS was moved to the margin of the photonic forbidden band. As a result, the reflection spectra were effectively broadened and well matched with the absorption of the active layers; this resulted in a PCE as high as 9.36 ± 0.16% and an AVT of 14.31 ± 0.65% in the visible range for PTB7-Th-based ST-PSCs. Furthermore, theoretical simulations conducted using transfer matrix modeling (TMM) reveal that the OTS can effectively redistribute the optical electric field and cause absorption enhancement. Thus, we believe that performance improvement caused by the new light management method of OTS can pave the way towards the commercial application of ST-PSCs.


Fig. 1a shows the designed ST-PSC architecture of ITO/PFN/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag/WO3(x) [WO3/LiF]5. Herein, x nm WO3 (x = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 nm) and 1DPCs of [WO3/LiF]5 were evaporated under the same vacuum on the ST-PSCs. For the 1DPCs, the working principle is based on nHdH = nLdL = λ0/4, where n represents the refractive index of materials, d represents film thickness and λ0 is the center wavelength of the forbidden band. According to the location of the absorption trough of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, λ0 was set as 560 nm. In the visible light range, the average refractive indices of LiF and WO3 are 1.32 and 2.08, respectively; thus, the thickness of 1DPCs is [WO3 (67.3 nm)/LiF (106.1 nm)]5. Herein, 5 pairs of 1DPCs were chosen to maintain the average transmission in the visible region.


Fig. 1b shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) curves under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G in ambient air for the investigated ST-PSCs. The detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. For the ST-PSCs without EAL and 1DPCs as control devices, a relatively low PCE of 6.27 ± 0.13%, composed of a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 11.63 ± 0.05 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 ± 0.01 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.2 ± 0.2%, was obtained. Upon employing 1DPCs as a Bragg reflector, all the ST-PSCs achieved the same Voc and a similar FF; this suggested that the built-in potential was not exchanged by an outer optical component. For the ST-PSCs with bare 1DPCs, Jsc and PCE are 15.94 ± 0.04 mA cm−2 and 8.56 ± 0.15%, respectively. It can be emphasized again that the selective reflection from 1DPCs has a positive effect on the photocurrent. Then, the thickness of the high refractive index material WO3 of the outside 1DPCs is increased from 20 nm to 100 nm, and WO3 lies next to the top Ag electrode and has been named as extra added layer (EAL) in this study. Obviously, the ST-PSCs with EALs of different thicknesses show a gradually improved Jsc, and the optimal device with a 60 nm EAL exhibits the Jsc and PCE values of 17.15 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 and 9.36 ± 0.16%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE value reported to date for ST-PSCs with the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system and comparable to that of the opaque PSCs; note that the PCE of ST-PSCs with a 60 nm EAL has increased by 9.3% as compared to that of the 0 nm devices; this suggests that the OTS formed at the interface between Ag and EAL/1DPCs plays a very important role in improving the efficiency. Furthermore, the statistic histograms of PCE for the ST-PSCs with 0 nm and 60 nm EALs are shown in the insets of Fig. 1b and have been calculated from 25 cells for each type, indicating narrow distribution and high reproducibility.

To further comprehend the improvement of Jsc of the ST-PSCs, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 1c and d, presenting spectral response in the range from 300 nm to 850 nm. It is observed from the control device without EAL and 1DPCs that the collection of photons becomes less effective, and the IPCE within all the visible range is distinctly reduced. When the device is covered with bare 1DPCs (0 nm EAL), the crest of the IPCE curve is enhanced to 75% (around 525 nm) and a valley appears at about 650 nm, which should be attributed to high reflectance of the designed photonic forbidden band and OTS. After inserting the EALs with different thicknesses between Ag and 1DPCs, the IPCE curves were increased significantly as compared to those of the control devices in the range of wave valley. Encouragingly, the IPCE curve obtained with 60 nm EAL exhibits excellent extended enhancement in the region of 540–700 nm (Fig. 1d) and a typical wave valley at about 490 nm by the OTS in the range of the photonic forbidden band. Note that the integrated current density of devices with 60 nm EAL obtained from the IPCE spectra is 17.07 mA cm−2, which agrees well with the J–V measurement results of 17.15 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 (Fig. 1b and Table 1). The enhancement in the IPCE range from 540 nm to about 700 nm is probably due to reflection enhancement caused by increasing the EAL thickness between Ag and EAL/1DPCs, which is consistent with the J–V results.
To satisfy the demand of integrated building windows, transmission curves of the designed ST-PSCs were studied and are shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding average visible transmission (AVT) values for different devices are the average values that have been calculated via the transmission spectra (Fig. 2a) from 380 nm to 780 nm. The AVT results were calculated from 15 cells for each type and are listed in Table 1. Control devices without EAL and 1DPCs have a relatively high transmission spectrum, and the AVT is around 30.12 ± 0.61%, which is consistent with the absorption coefficients of PTB7-Th:PC71BM. For devices with bare 1DPCs (0 nm EAL), the transmission curve shows a typical groove from 450 to 650 nm and a transmission peak at about 650 nm that is induced by the OTS. Then, after increasing the thickness of EALs, the typical groove ranges are broadened and move towards a longer wavelength. This indicates that more incident light is trapped in the devices to support the opportunity of second absorption for PCE improvement. Note that because of the excellent efficiency of ST-PSCs with a 60 nm EAL, a transmission peak appears at about 490 nm that is induced by the OTS, and the AVT of 14.31 ± 0.65% is still maintained; herein, three types of images of the ST-PSCs obtained through the building of Jilin University are shown in Fig. 2b, indicating that colorless control devices can be changed using a kind of colored ST-PSCs with EAL and 1DPCs. Even the ST-PSCs with a 60 nm EAL achieved an AVT of 14.31 ± 0.65%; moreover, they still provided a better transmission in the outdoor environment. Overall, the variation trend of the transmission spectra is consistent with the observations acquired from the IPCE; this provides direct evidence that OTS can effectively adjust the optical absorption and improve the Jsc. Herein, ST-PSCs with well-adjusted OTS have achieved a PCE of 9.36 ± 0.16% with an AVT of 14.31 ± 0.65%, which is the highest PCE for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based ST-PSCs. For a better comparison of the performance of the ST-PSCs reported in this study with those of other typical ST-PSCs, the device structures, PCEs and AVTs of the ST-PSCs are listed in Table S1. Although the highest efficiency and transmittance are driven by the near-infrared absorption of new materials, performance improvement by controlling the OTS is a universal method, which can further enhance the PCE for many active layer systems.
Since the experimental results show that the OTS affects the performance of the ST-PSCs, the abovementioned phenomena have been simulated using optical modeling based on the TMM. Similar to the Tamm states for electrons at the crystal boundaries, OTS has been first named by Kavokin et al. and can be formed between a metal and a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). In the reflection spectra, OTS is associated with a sharp and narrow reflection dip in the photonic bandgap of the 1DPCs. For the designed stacked structure of Ag/EAL/1DPC, the eigenenergy of an OTS can be formed by the “phase matching condition”:
rAgr1DPCsexp(2iϕ) = 1
(1)
where
rAg is the amplitude reflection coefficient from the EAL with the refractive index nH to the Ag electrode, r1DPCs is the amplitude reflection coefficient from the EAL to the 1DPCs, and ϕ = nHxω/c is the phase shifting of the wave transporting the distance x in the EAL with the refractive index nH and angular frequency ω. For the 0 nm EAL device, x is zero, and eqn (1) can be rewritten as follows:

rAgr1DPCs = 1
(2)
The reflection coefficient rAg is achieved by the Fresnel formula  where nAg is the refractive index of the Ag electrode. The reflection coefficient r1DPCs can be defined by the transfer matrix method  where ω0 is the center frequency photonic bandgap of the 1DPCs.
To intuitively explore the role of OTS in ST-PSCs, the reflection of Ag/EAL(x)/DPCs with WO3 at different thicknesses as the EAL was calculated by the TMM. At first, the relationship between the thickness of the EAL and the reflection of the EAL(x)/1DPCs was computed, as shown in Fig. 3a. The stabilized yellow band indicates that the photonic bandgaps in the 1DPCs have been formed, which is independent of the thickness of WO3 as the EAL. Then, upon combining the thin Ag film with bare 1DPCs, an undesired reflection dip of the OTS appeared at about 655 nm (Fig. 3b), which narrowed the photonic forbidden band. The simulated reflection curves of Ag/EAL/1DPCs obtained by TMM are plotted in Fig. S1. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the effective reflection band is about 190 nm, which has been calculated from 450 nm to 640 nm. After increasing the thickness of the EALs, the positions of the reflection dip are moved, and the reflection edge appears remarkably red-shifted to the region of red light. Surprisingly, the OTS reflection dip of the sample with a 60 nm EAL moves to the edge of the photonic forbidden band of 1DPCs at about 490 nm, and the reflection valley red-shifts to about 730 nm because of the wide FWHM of 220 nm between 490 nm and 710 nm. This suitable matching of the reflection spectra by adjusting the EAL thickness and OTS position is quite valid for the enhancement of Jsc, particularly broadening to the near-infrared region where the number of solar photons is largest and matches the absorption of the active layer well.
The thickness of the EAL plays an important role in the reflection spectra of Ag/EAL/1DPCs; therefore, we have attempted to explore another origin of performance enhancement via TMM. Exactly as stated in eqn (1), the propagation distance x between the Ag electrode and 1DPCs, that is, the thickness of EAL, can change the reflection phase shift, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 3c. The solid black square represents the OTS position in the photonic bandgap of 1DPCs. It can be seen that the reflection phase shifts steeply change from −π to π to the left of the OTS position. While the reflection phase shifts are close to zero at the right of the OTS, the curves fall off slowly later. For the stacked structure of Ag/EAL(x)/1DPCs with x = 60 nm, the OTS position is close to the short-wave region; this means that the reflection phase shift can be controlled to affect the optical electric field intensity (|E(x)|2) of ST-PSCs.
Correspondingly, the normalized modulus square of the optical electric field intensity |E(x)|2 in the active layer is redistributed by changing the reflection phase shift, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 4. Note that all layers are speculated to be isotropic, and the absorption of PTB7-Th:PC71BM is neglected. In Fig. 4a–f, it can be clearly observed that the enhanced region of |E(x)|2 shows a red-shifted phenomenon in the active layers with an increase in the thickness of the EALs. Surprisingly, the desired strengthened range of |E(x)|2 is broadened and located within the absorption range of the active layer by inserting a 60 nm EAL between the Ag electrode and 1DPCs. Compared to that of the devices with a 0 nm EAL, the OTS position of the devices with a 60 nm EAL is moved from about 655 nm to 490 nm, corresponding to the blue-black band in the active layers. The abovementioned phenomena of redistribution of the optical electric field is in accordance with both the transmission spectra and IPCE spectra of the designed ST-PSCs, enabling absorption enhancement of the incident light and simultaneously increasing both Jsc and PCE.
In addition to the seeking efficiency, color characteristic is another significant feature of ST-PSCs, which can meet the aesthetic requirement of photovoltaic windows in architecture. Herein, the color coordinates (x, y) of the ST-PSCs were computed under AM 1.5G illumination light and mapped on the CIE 1931 color space. As shown in Fig. 5, the color coordinates (0.317, 0.320) of the device without EAL and 1DPCs are close to those of the AM 1.5G light source with (0.331, 0.342); this indicates that the control devices are colorless. The color coordinates (0.308, 0.188) of the devices with a 0 nm EAL and (0.179, 0.157) of devices with a 60 nm EAL are far away from those of the AM 1.5G light source (0.331, 0.342) and are located in the purple and blue region, respectively; this indicates that the ST-PSCs have become colored devices after combining Ag/EAL/1DPCs. The color coordinates of the three typical devices agree with the images shown in Fig. 2b.
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel approach for achieving high-efficiency ST-PSCs by controlling the OTS. The reflection dip of the OTS can be moved to the edge of the photonic forbidden band, and the reflective bandwidth can be widened by increasing the thickness of a suitable EAL between the Ag and 1DPCs. The-state-of-the-art ST-PSCs incorporated with a 60 nm EAL exhibit a PCE of 9.36 ± 0.16% and AVT of 14.31 ± 0.65%, which are almost the best result for ST-PCSs. In addition, the phase matching condition of OTS was studied, and the TMM simulation results revealed that the OTS and the reflection phase shift changed synchronously; this led to the enhancement in the absorption of the active layer via redistribution of the optical electric field. Finally, the colored ST-PSCs induced by OTS can potentially meet the aesthetic requirement of the photovoltaic windows. We believe that the OTS as a new light management method can push the further development of ST-PSCs.

The preprinted indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were preprocessed by acetone, absolute ethyl alcohol and deionized water using an ultrasonic washing unit, having a transmission of 86% and a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω sq−1. The cathode interface material poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol/acetic acid (95%:5% by volume) for 6 h. Then, it was spin-coated on cleaned ITO by 2500 rpm for 60 s in a glovebox without thermal annealing. For the active layer of the blended poly[4,8-bis(5(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiopheneco-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate]:phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7-Th:PC71BM, Materials, used as received), PTB7-Th and PC71BM were dissolved in a mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB)/1,8-diiodooctane (97%:3% by volume) at a weight ratio of 1:1.5. After being stirred for 12 h, it was spin-coated on the PFN film at 1800 rpm for 60 s without thermal annealing. A 10 nm MoO3 as a hole transport layer and a 17 nm Ag as a top anode were subsequently evaporated under a high vacuum (∼10−5 Pa). The active area of the devices was about 6.4 mm2, which was the overlap region between ITO and Ag electrode (2 mm × 3.2 mm). Herein, eight cells were fabricated on one glass substrate, and their detailed sizes are shown in Fig. S2a. Then, WO3 with different thicknesses (0 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm, 60 nm, 80 nm and 100 nm) and 1DPCs with the structure [WO3(67.3 nm)/LiF (106.1 nm)]5 (λ0 = 560 nm) were subsequently evaporated under a high vacuum (∼10−5 Pa) for the whole region of ITO using a shadow mask. Fig. S2b shows an image of the real ST-PSCs with EAL and 1DPCs.


The PCEs of ST-PSCs were obtained from the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristic curve measurements (computer-programmed Keithley 2601 source) under AM 1.5G solar illumination using an Oriel 300 W solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Light intensity was measured using a photometer (International Light, IL1400). The incident photon-to-current collection efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using the Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD. An ultraviolet/visible spectrometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu) was used to obtain the ST-PSCs results of transmission spectra. A spectroscopic ellipsometer (XLS-100, J. A. Woollam) and a step profiler (ET 150, Kosaka) were employed to measure the thickness of each layer.
