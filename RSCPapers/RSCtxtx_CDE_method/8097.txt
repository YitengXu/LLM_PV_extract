We present a novel, rational design of three-dimensional (3D) TiO2-based photoanodes using anatase hierarchical TiO2 nanotube arrays as the bottom layer and P25 nanoparticles as the top layer for dye-sensitized solar cells. Owing to favorable electron transport, large surface area and pronounced light harvesting, the 3D nanoarchitecture-based solar cell shows a significantly enhanced efficiency of 7.24% compared to the monolayer counterparts (~5%).

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were developed in 1991, since then they have been the most suitable candidate for cheap, stable and high-efficiency solar cells. Recently, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs achieved has been 13%, by using porphyrin sensitizers and cobalt(II/III) redox couples. Typically, DSSCs are fabricated into a sandwich structure which consists of a dye-sensitized metal oxide film (photoanode), an electrolyte and a counter electrode. As a critical component of DSSCs, the photoanode has a great influence on dye loading, light harvesting and photo-injected electron transport. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is recognized as the most excellent photoanode material because of its low cost, high conduction band and excellent photostability. To date, the TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) mesoporous film still represents a relatively high performance photoanode since it possesses a large surface area, allowing sufficient loading of dye molecules. However, the short electron diffusion length, which is due to the disordered structure and large grain boundary of TiO2 NPs, limits the further enhancement of the photovoltaic performance. Hence, vertically aligned 1D nanoarrays such as nanowires (NWs), nanorods (NRs) and nanotubes (NTs) have been studied to enhance the electron transport and suppress the charge recombination. The key challenge for 1D nanoarrays is their relatively small surface-to-volume ratios. Fabricating hierarchical structures is an effective way to overcome this drawback. Generally, these structures are based on a two-step method in which NW trunks are first prepared and then branches are grown on the surface of the trunks.

To foster strengths and circumvent weaknesses, in this study, we report a novel bilayered TiO2 photoanode consisting of hierarchical TiO2 NTs (HNTs) and P25 NPs. The anatase HNTs, which act as the bottom layer, are grown on a fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) substrate via a one-step hydrothermal route and the P25 NPs, which act as the top layer, are coated by a doctor-blade coating method on the top of the HNTs. In this structure, the HNTs play a crucial role since they feature a larger surface area (than NTs) and faster electron transport (than NPs). As a result, the HNT–P25 bilayered photoanode-based DSSC shows a great enhancement in PCE than individual HNT- and P25-based cells.
This bilayered photoanode was prepared through a hydrothermal growth process and a subsequent doctor-blade coating process, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. The crystal structures of the prepared samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. S1). The diffraction peaks of the P25 powder are consistent with a mixed phase of rutile and anatase. It is worth noting that the HNT film exhibits diffraction peaks corresponding to the anatase phase only, and as expected, the HNT–P25 film exhibits all the diffraction peaks of rutile and anatase.
As shown in Fig. 2, the morphologies and microstructures of the HNT and P25 photoanodes are observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a shows that the P25 NP photoanode has a thickness of ~15 μm, which is believed to be the optimal thickness for NP-based DSSCs. The HNT photoanode was fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal growth method. The photovoltaic performance of HNT arrays with different growth times was investigated by J–V measurement, and the results are shown in Fig. S2. Undoubtedly, the HNT arrays with a growth time of 9 h achieved a remarkable PCE of 5.08% (3.59%, 3.68% and 4.56% for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h, respectively), so the HNT arrays with a growth time of 9 h are chosen to fabricate the HNT photoanode. Fig. 2b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the HNT array. The length and the inner diameter of the HNTs are ~14 μm and 50–100 nm, respectively. As shown in the TEM image of an individual HNT (inset in Fig 2b), a lot of nanorod branches, 100–200 nm in length and 5–10 nm in diameter, are grown on the NT trunk. Fig. 2c and S3 show the SEM images of the cross-sectional view of the HNT array at low and high magnifications, respectively, which clearly show the hollow structure of the HNTs.
The HNT array is an effective structure to simultaneously improve the charge transport and enlarge the surface area. As expected, the surface areas of the P25 and HNT photoanodes are investigated by measuring the dye absorption amounts (Fig. S4). The amounts of dye absorbed on the different photoanodes are calculated by using the Beer–Lambert law. Obviously, the P25 photoanode absorbed more dye molecules than the HNT photoanode (124 vs. 75 nmol cm−2), which indicates that the P25 photoanode possesses a larger surface area. To accommodate the favorable characteristics, i.e. large surface area of P25 NPs and superior electron transport properties of the HNT array, a bilayered photoanode was designed. Fig. 3 displays the SEM image of this two-layer stack TiO2 photoanode and depicts the respective schematic of individual HNT and P25 nanostructures. It reveals that a uniform TiO2 NP film with a thickness of ~9 μm is formed on the top of the HNT array (~13 μm in thickness). The bottom HNT layer does not collapse or break after coating the P25 film. Attentive observation of the interface between the HNT layer and P25 layer confirms that these two different TiO2 architectures are well-connected, which is favorable for photo-generated electron transport. Thus, such a bilayered nanostructure will be more efficient than the individual counterparts for DSSC application.

Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for DSSCs based on P25, HNT and HNT–P25 photoanodes. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the different DSSCs are summarized in Table 1. Strikingly, the HNT–P25 cell attained the highest PCE of 7.24% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.49 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62. The remarkable improvement in PCE for the HNT–P25 cell compared to the single layered P25 (5.50%) or HNT (5.08%) is mainly attributed to the enhanced Jsc value. As well known, the Jsc of DSSCs is closely related to the amount of dye absorbed on the photoanode. The dye amount on the HNT–P25 photoanode (167 nmol cm−2) is significantly larger than those on the P25 (124 nmol cm−2) and HNT (75 nmol cm−2) photoanodes, which will lead to a higher photocurrent density of the HNT–P25 photoanode. Moreover, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra indicating a similar variation tendency of Jsc are shown in Fig. 4b. The bilayered HNT–P25 configuration shows the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) value over the entire wavelength region of 400 to 800 nm. This could be attributed to the increased dye loading, enhanced light scattering and efficient charge collection within the bilayered TiO2 architecture compared to the individual counterparts.

The electrochemical behavior in DSSCs such as electron transport kinetics and interface carrier recombination has a great influence on photovoltaic performance. Hence, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Voc decay rate measurement were performed to investigate these electrochemical characteristics. The Nyquist plots of relevant cells are presented in Fig. 5a. The recombination resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface (R2, second semicircle) of P25-, HNT- and HNT–P25-based cells is 72.8, 219.3 and 111.1 Ω, respectively. Typically, the higher recombination resistance implies a slower electron recombination process (or longer electron lifetime) and thus a higher Voc value. Notably, the HNT-based cell exhibits the highest R2 value, which suggests that the 1D nanostructured HNT arrays exhibit superior electron transport and suppressed electron recombination. Since the P25 NPs provide more grain boundaries and surface defects for charge recombination, the R2 values change orderly with a descending sequence of HNT > HNT–P25 > P25. This result accords well with the variation of the Voc value (0.73 V for HNT, 0.71 V for HNT–P25 and 0.67 V for P25). Voc decay rate measurement has been performed to further investigate the electron recombination kinetics. After interrupting the illumination, the Voc will sharply decay because of electron recombination, as shown in Fig 5b. It was observed that the P25 and HNT–P25 cells exhibit a faster Voc decay rate than the HNT cell, leading to a faster electron recombination reaction and thus a shorter electron lifetime. Insightfully, the electron lifetime (τn) can be calculated according to Voc decay curves by using the following equation:
where
kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. The results are shown in Fig 5c. The τn of the P25 cell is shorter than that of the HNT–P25 cell, and HNT has the longest τn of all three cells. Therefore, the highest Voc value can be observed for the HNT cell and these results are in agreement with EIS analysis.


In this work, we have proposed a novel 1D–0D combined bilayered TiO2 nanostructure made of HNT arrays as the bottom layer and P25 NPs as the top layer. Such a bilayered photoanode exhibits complementary and synergistic properties, in which the HNT bottom layer can provide the direct electron transport pathway, and the P25 top layer can offer a large surface area to adsorb more dye molecules. In addition, the bilayered photoanode with a thickness of ~22 μm can more effectively harvest incident light. Therefore, the DSSC based on such a bilayered photoanode achieved a remarkably enhanced PCE of 7.25% compared to the DSSC solely composed of P25 NPs (5.50%) or HNT arrays (5.08%). Our work demonstrates the feasibility of creating 3D photoanodes featuring integrated functionality, such as fast electron transport, large surface area and great light-harvesting capacity, by fully utilizing multi-dimensional and multi-functional nanostructures.


The FTO glasses (1 cm × 2 cm, 7–8 Ω sq−1) were first cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol and deionized water, each for 15 min, and then dried by purging with nitrogen. Then, the TiO2 HNT arrays were grown on the FTO substrate through a hydrothermal reaction. Specifically, the FTO glass was placed (with a slope angle of 60°) into a precursor solution containing 0.35 g of potassium titanium oxide oxalate dihydrate, 17.5 mL of diethylene glycol and 2.5 mL of H2O and then allowed to undergo a hydrothermal process at 180 °C for 9 h. The as-prepared samples were soaked in 50 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by annealing in air at 450 °C for 30 min at a heating rate of 8 °C min−1.


The TiO2 NP (P25) film was deposited on the FTO glass by a doctor-blade method. And the HNT–P25 photoanode was prepared by doctor-blade coating the P25 on the HNT array. After that, the as-prepared electrodes (P25, HNT and HNT–P25) were sensitized with 0.5 mM N719 dye in ethanol solution. These dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes and Pt-coated FTO counter electrodes were sandwiched together, and a liquid I−/I3−-based electrolyte containing 0.03 M I2, 0.06 M LiI, 0.5 M tert-butyl-pyridine, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile solution was injected into the internal space of the cells. The active area of the DSSCs is 0.1 cm2.


The morphologies of these photoanodes were observed by means of a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS ULTRA 55) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100F). The crystal phases of the samples were identified using an X-ray diffraction analyzer (Rigaku, MiniFlex600) with Cu Kα radiation. The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using an electrochemical workstation (VerasSTAT 3-400, Princeton Applied Research) under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The amounts of dye loaded on the different photoanodes (desorbed in 0.02 M NaOH solution) were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) and calculated using the Beer–Lambert law. The EIS spectra of the samples were measured using an electrochemical workstation in dark conditions in the frequency range from 100 MHz to 1 MHz.
