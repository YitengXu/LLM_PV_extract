Ligands containing first and second generation hole-transport triphenylamino-dendrons have been evaluated as ancillary ligands in copper(I) DSCs yielding an optimal efficiency of 3.77% in unmasked cells. The effects of masking the DSCs on measured parameters are discussed.

In semiconductors such as titanium dioxide, the band gap is too large for excitation of electrons to the conduction band by visible light. However, by modifying the surface of the semiconductor with a photosensitizer possessing appropriate HOMO and LUMO energies, electrons may be injected into the conduction band. In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) the photosensitization of semiconductor nanoparticles is coupled with a hole-transporting electrolyte to give a photovoltaic light-harvesting system. The best performing DSCs to date utilize ruthenium complexes as photosensitizers, although the terrestrial abundance of ruthenium raises questions about the sustainability of the technology and makes it imperative to investigate the use of alternative Earth abundant metal compounds. Metal complexes used as photosensitizers require an anchoring ligand (usually carboxylate or phosphonate) which provides a covalent link to the semiconductor and ancillary ligands which tune the properties of the materials. We have commenced systematic studies of d10 metal complexes as photosensitizers, and other research groups are also actively pursuing the use of copper(I) following the pioneering work of Sauvage et al. In conjunction with probing the application of Earth-abundant metals in DSCs, we are interested in engineering functionality into ancillary ligands which can modulate the performance of the DSC. One way of improving the efficiency of a DSC is to minimize recombination of the electron–hole pair generated after electron injection by an effective spatial separation of the hole. We have recently described hybrid ancillary ligands in which hole-transport motifs familiar from molecular electronics are grafted onto metal-binding domains.

In this communication, we report the synthesis of 2,2′-bipyridine ligands 1 and 2 (Scheme 1) bearing first and second generation hole-transport dendrons and describe the on-surface synthesis of the heteroleptic sensitizers [Cu(1)L]+ and [Cu(2)L]+ on mesoporous TiO2 by exchange reactions of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(2)2][PF6] with surface-anchored ligands L = 3, 4 and 5 (Scheme 2). Ligands 1 and 2 (Scheme 1) combine a metal-binding bpy domain decorated with hole-transport dendrons and the 6,6′-dimethyl substitution pattern required for stabilization of copper(I).
Ligand 1 was prepared in high yield by treatment of 4,4′-bis(4-bromophenyl)-6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine with bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine (Scheme 1) whereas 2 was prepared in a stepwise manner starting with Boc-protected bis(4-bromophenyl)amine. Reaction of the latter with two equivalents of di(4-methoxyphenyl)amine, followed by deprotection gave 6 and subsequent coupling with 4,4′-bis(4-bromophenyl)-6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (Scheme 1) led to 2 in 74% yield. Compounds 1 and 2 were fully characterized by spectroscopic and mass spectrometric methods. Both ligands are yellow/green and their solution electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 1) show intense absorptions assigned to π* ← n, π transitions. The increase in intensity of absorptions on going from 1 to 2 is consistent with the extension of the conjugated system.
Computational-chemistry studies confirm that in both 1 and 2 the degenerate HOMO and HOMO − 1 are localized on the dendron while the LUMO is localized on the bpy metal-binding domain (Fig. 2). The band gap in the ligand is very similar in both generations at all calculational levels up to 6-31G**. The introduction of the methoxy substituents raises the HOMO energy by 0.3 V in both the first and second generation ligands. The band gap in 2 is calculated to be approximately 0.5 eV more positive than in 1. The ligands are redox active and cyclic voltammetric studies in dichloromethane solution (Fig. S1, ESI) show that 1 exhibits a reversible first oxidation at +0.27 V versus Fc/Fc+ and 2 at −0.11 V consistent with the calculations. The calculated HOMO energies from the electrochemical E1/2 values are −5.24 and −4.83 V for 1 and 2, respectively.
The dark red homoleptic complexes [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(2)2][PF6] were prepared by reaction of [Cu(NCMe)4][PF6] with two equivalents of ligand 1 or 2 in CHCl3–MeCN, and were isolated in high yields and were characterized by ESI or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, NMR, IR and UV-VIS spectroscopies, and elemental analysis. The mass spectra exhibited peak envelopes corresponding to [Cu(1)2]+ (m/z 1664.6, ESI MS) and [Cu(2)2]+ (m/z 3223.9, MALDI-TOF MS), respectively. Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of acetonitrile solutions of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(2)2][PF6]. An approximate doubling of the molar extinction coefficient is observed on going from a ligand to the respective complex, as expected for the formation of an {ML2} complex; a common solvent was not used for ligands and complexes because the ligands are not soluble in MeCN. The broad absorption bands of the complex extend into the visible and the shoulders at 486 and 505 nm for [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(2)2][PF6], respectively, are assigned to MLCT transitions.
The 1H NMR spectrum of each complex was consistent with the presence of one ligand environment; the 1H and 13C NMR spectra were assigned using COSY, NOESY, HMQC, HMBC and DEPT methods. The complexes are redox active and cyclic voltammograms (CH2Cl2 solutions of the complexes) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). [Cu(1)2][PF6] undergoes a reversible oxidation at +0.30 V followed by a quasi-reversible wave centred at +0.45 V. By analogy with the free ligand (Fig. S1a, ESI), we assign these waves to ligand-based and metal-based processes, respectively. The CV for [Cu(2)2][PF6] is complex, but a comparison of the data for 2 and [Cu(2)2][PF6] (Fig. S1b, ESI) allows the quasi-reversible process at +0.45 V to be assigned as copper-centred; the first oxidation process at −0.10 V is a reversible ligand-based process. The electrochemical HOMO levels for [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(1)2][PF6] are calculated to be −5.24 and −4.87 V, respectively, i.e. very similar to those of the free ligands.
We have developed an assembly strategy in which mesoporous titania is functionalized with an anchoring ligand which is metallated by exchange with a labile homoleptic copper(I) complex to produce a surface-bound sensitizer. Mass spectrometric and solid-state absorption spectroscopic data support the formation of heteroleptic copper(I) complexes on the semiconductor surface. DSCs functionalized with [Cu(1)L]+ or [Cu(2)L]+ (L = 3, 4 or 5) were prepared by dipping photoanodes functionalized with anchoring ligands 3, 4 or 5 (Scheme 2) into CH2Cl2 solutions of [Cu(1)2][PF6] or [Cu(2)2][PF6] for 20 hours. During this period, the colourless electrodes turned red-orange and the colour persisted when the anodes were washed with CH2Cl2, indicating that copper(I)-containing dyes were anchored to the semiconductor (Scheme 3). A standard I−/I3− electrolyte was employed in sealed cells and the device performances were first measured using unmasked cells to allow comparisons with previously reported data. The light to power conversion efficiency of each cell was measured under illumination of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) 1, 3, 6 and 47 days after sealing. Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra (Fig. S2, ESI) closely resemble the absorption spectra in the visible region with maxima around 460 nm for [Cu(1)2]+/3 and [Cu(2)2]+/3, respectively. IQE values of 21 and 27% were measured for these maxima.
From the results in Table 1 for the unmasked cells, a number of significant trends arise. The most important observation is that on going from ancillary ligand 1 to 2 with a common anchoring ligand (e.g. going from a combination of [Cu(1)2]+/3 to [Cu(2)2]+/3), an increase in JSC is observed and, in all but one case, also an increase in VOC but this is less significant than the improvement in short circuit current density. The fill-factor is little affected or drops slightly on going from 1 to 2. The light to power conversion efficiency increases significantly with the incorporation of the more highly conjugated light-harvesting domain in the dye. In these comparative studies, the highest efficiency (η = 2.61%) is achieved with a [Cu(2)2]+/3 combination six days after sealing the cell, a ripening effect that we have observed as general for copper(I) DSCs.Table 1 shows that η increases with time up to three days after sealing the DSC and then remains essentially constant for the next three days. The initial increase is probably associated with reorganization and/or aggregation of dye molecules on the surface. The enhancement of conversion efficiencies effected by the first- and second-generation dendrons is demonstrated by comparing data for [Cu(1)2]+/3 and [Cu(2)2]+/3 (Table 1) with those for [Cu(Me2bpy)2]+ (Me2bpy = 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) and anchor ligand 3; this combination in an unmasked cell gives an efficiency of 1.18% 2 days after sealing, and 1.30% 7 days after sealing with respect to 7.29% for N719.

The highest efficiencies are achieved using anchoring ligand 3. This observation supports our previous findings that phosphonate anchors typically perform better than carboxylate anchors, and is consistent with the findings of Grätzel et al. The poorest efficiencies are with anchoring ligand 4. By comparing data in which the only variable is 4versus3 (e.g. [Cu(1)2]+/3versus [Cu(1)2]+/4), we conclude that the poor performance of DSCs containing 4 does not arise from steric factors associated with the dendritic ligand 1 or 2. The improvement in efficiency on going from anchoring ligand 4 to 5 implies that the introduction of the phenyl spacer may be a means of enhancing the performance of the DSC and we are currently investigating the use of spacers in phosphonate-anchoring ligands. The last column in Table 1 shows relative conversion efficiencies, setting the value for N719 to 100%. The combination of 3 and [Cu(2)2]+ (phosphonic acid anchor and second generation ligand) achieves approximately one-quarter the efficiency of N719 and this is maintained after a period of 47 days.
In 2012, Snaith emphasized the importance of masking DSCs during measurements. The high short circuit current densities observed for N719 (>22 mA cm−2, Table 1) are undoubtedly a consequence of using unmasked cells and result in an overestimation of conversion efficiency. We therefore repeated measurements using masked DSCs assembled using anchoring ligand 3 (phosphonic acid) with [Cu(1)2]+ or [Cu(2)2]+. The performances of cells that were top-masked and fully masked (Fig. 3) were measured and data are given at the bottom of Table 1 along with parameters for the same, unmasked cells. The current density–voltage characteristics are shown in Fig. 4 and confirm that the device performance of [Cu(2)2]+/3 surpasses that of [Cu(1)2]+/3. All cells exhibit a good fill factor. The current density decreases by a small amount on going from the unmasked to the top-masked cell, and falls significantly when the cell is completely masked. Open circuit voltages also decrease. Similar trends are observed for N719 (Table 1). Importantly, the relative efficiencies of each of the dyes [Cu(1)2]+/3 and [Cu(2)2]+/3 with respect to N719 are similar whether the cells are unmasked or masked.
Preliminary studies using different solvents for the ligand exchange step also reveal an effect on the overall efficiency of the cell. Photoanodes with phosphonate anchoring ligand 3 were prepared and were dipped into an MeCN (rather than CH2Cl2) solution of [Cu(1)2][PF6]. No other change was made to the fabrication of the sealed, unmasked DSCs and under illumination of 1 sun, an excellent efficiency of 3.77% (with respect to 10.93% for N719) after 8 days was obtained. A high short circuit current density of 9.55 mA cm−2 was recorded with a VOC of 593 mV, and we are now focusing on optimization of DSC conditions.

The incorporation of hole-transport substituents onto ancillary ligands in copper(I) DSCs is a successful strategy and has resulted in the best observed efficiency to date of 3.77% for such a system. We are currently optimizing the performances of DSCs incorporating copper(I) complexes of dendron-functionalized ligands related to 1 and 2 by further varying the ligand structure, the anchoring ligands, dipping-solvents and electrolytes.
