MXenes as 2D materials have attracted great attention due to their high electrical conductivity, high surface area, high transparency in the visible range and high hydrophilicity. They have been investigated in devices and systems including batteries, supercapacitors, and sensors as well as in catalysis but not in optoelectronic devices. In this work, we studied the application of Ti3C2Tx for electron and hole collection in organic solar cells (OSCs). The work function of Ti3C2Tx can be increased by a UV–ozone treatment and decreased through a treatment with N2H4. It can be thus tuned in a range from 4.08 to 4.95 eV. MXene films with different work functions are studied as electron and hole collection buffer materials for non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) with poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) as the active materials. The OSCs with MXenes for electron or hole collection layers can exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 9.06% or 9.02%. These efficiencies are comparable to those obtained using conventional charge-collection buffer materials.

MXenes are two-dimensional transition metal carbides or nitrides. They have drawn great attention owing to their high conductivity, high transmittance in the visible range, superior hydrophilicity and high thermal stability. They have the general formula Mn+1XnTx with M standing for an early transition metal, X for C and/or N, T for the terminal groups like –OH, –F, or –O, and n being 1–3.Fig. 1 shows the schematic structure of Ti3C2Tx. MXenes are usually produced by selectively etching away the A layers (A = Al or Si, etc.) of a MAX phase since the metallic M–A bonds are weaker than the M–X bonds. The variation of the elements or the terminal groups can affect the electronic structure and properties of MXenes. The interesting electronic and electrochemical properties of MXenes endue them with important applications in various areas. For example, they can be used as electrode materials for lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, field-effect transistors, triboelectric nanogenerators, or sensors. The gravimetric capacitance of MXenes can be much higher than that of graphene in acidic electrolytes. They can also be used for high-performance electromagnetic interference shielding, thermoelectric conversion, catalysis, antibacterial treatment, and water treatment.

Apart from the electrical conductivity, the work function of MXenes can significantly affect their application in electronic devices. As revealed by experiments and theoretical simulations, the work function of MXenes depends on the synthesis process and the terminal group. For instance, Mariano et al. observed a work function of 5.28 ± 0.03 eV for –OH and –O terminated MXenes by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Xu et al. found that the work function of –OH terminated MXenes is 4.98 eV by KPFM. Wang et al. studied the work function of their MXenes by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) and reported a work function of ∼4.6 eV. MXenes with different work functions were investigated as the electrodes for transistors. Theoretical simulations confirm that the terminal groups can greatly affect the work function of MXenes by inducing a surface dipole moment and thus shifting the Fermi level. Generally, the –O terminal group can increase the work function whereas –OH terminal groups can decrease the work function. However, a good understanding of the work function of MXenes is still missing. For example, although UV–ozone and hydrazine treatments are popular methods to vary the work function of graphene, these methods have not been investigated for the work function of MXenes. In addition, the high conductivity and high transparency suggest the potential application of MXenes in optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless, there is no report on their application as an electrode for optoelectronic devices such as solar cells in the literature. Some 2D materials including graphene-oxide and black phosphorus have been investigated as charge collection buffer materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). MXenes can have more advantages than those materials because MXenes are conductive and dispersible in water and they have high transmittance. It is interesting to investigate the application of MXenes in OSCs, particularly non-fullerene OSCs. Non-fullerene OSCs have attracted great attention because of their high photovoltaic efficiency. For example, the OSCs of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (PBDB-T:ITIC) can exhibit a photovoltaic efficiency of up to 12.7%. Other materials were developed for non-fullerene OSCs as well. The highest efficiencies of single junction and tandem non-fullerene OSCs are 14% and 17%, respectively.
In this work, we report the tunability of the work function of MXenes by various treatments and the applications of these MXenes as efficient electron or hole-collection buffer materials for non-fullerene OSCs of PBDB-T:ITIC. Treatments of MXenes with UV–ozone and/or hydrazine can tune their work function in a range from 4.08 to 4.95 eV. In addition, the work function variation can be reversed through a different treatment. The OSCs with MXenes as electron or hole collection buffer materials can exhibit high photovoltaic efficiency.

The MXenes obtained by etching MAX were characterized by XRD, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and AFM (Fig. 2). The XRD patterns confirm the successful preparation of 2D Ti3C2Tx. The XRD patterns at 9.52° (002), 19.15° (004), 34.0° (101), 38.82° (008), 39.04° (104), 41.82° (105) and 48.55° (107) are the typical patterns of Ti3AlC2 (JCPDS 52-0875). The disappearance of the (104) pattern at 39.04° and the shift of the (002) pattern from 9.52° to 6.40° after etching evidence the removal of the Al layers and the presence of –OH,–O and –F terminal groups. The shift and broadening of the (00l), (004), (006) and (008) patterns can be attributed to the presence of water in the MXene films prepared by vacuum filtration. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature.

As shown in Fig. 2(b), the MXene films have high transmittance in the visible and near infrared range. The weak band at around 750 nm is due to the plasma resonance of the MXene, and the peak in the UV range arises from TiO2 as a result of the oxidation of the MXene. The AFM study indicates that a mono-layered MXene is around 2 nm thick (Fig. 2(c)). This is consistent with that by other labs.
The work function of the pristine MXene (P-MXene) is 4.68 eV as revealed by UPS (Fig. 3). This work function is comparable to that of ITO. An UVO or N2H4 treatment can change the work function of the MXene. We found that the work function of the UVO-treated MXene (U-MXene) could not be determined by UPS (Fig. S1). The prolonged exposure of the MXene to UV light can significantly shift the UPS cut-off edge of the U-MXene. Similar sensitivity of the UPS cut-off edge to UV light was observed for the UVO-then-N2H4 treated MXene (UH-MXene) and N2H4-then-UVO treated MXenes (HU-MXene) as well. Presumably this shift induced by UV light is related to the light soaking effect of TiO2. But the UPS spectra of the P-MXene and N2H4-treated MXene (H-MXenes) are insensitive to the UV exposure. The UPS spectra indicate that their work functions are 4.68 and 4.41 eV, respectively.
In order to avoid the effect of UV exposure, the work functions of the U-MXene, UH-MXene and HU-MXenes were determined by KPFM (Fig. 4). The surface potential (VSPD) is related to the difference in the work functions of the KPFM tip (ϕtip) and the sample (ϕsample), eVSPD = ϕtip − ϕsample, with e as the elementary charge. The work function of ITO was measured as a reference for the determination of the work function of other samples. The surface potential of the as-prepared MXene is almost the same as that of ITO. This is consistent with the UPS results. The surface potentials of the U-MXene and HU-MXenes are lower than that of ITO by around 0.25 and 0.23 V, respectively. Thus, their work functions are 4.95 and 4.93 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that the surface potentials of these two MXenes are similar to that of PEDOT:PSS. This suggests the application of the U-MXene and HU-MXenes to replace PEDOT:PSS as the HTL of OSCs. The surface potential of the UH-MXene is 0.40 eV higher than that of ITO. Its work function is thus about 4.30 eV. The low work function suggests the application of the UH-MXene as an electron-collection material for OSCs. If a P-MXene film is treated by UVO for a prolonged time, the subsequent N2H4 treatment can lower the work function down to 4.08 eV. Therefore, the work function of MXenes can be tuned in a range from 4.08 to 4.95 eV through the UVO and N2H4 treatments.

To understand the mechanism of the work function variation by UVO or N2H4 treatment, the MXene films were studied by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S2, the Raman band in the range from 1000 to 1800 cm−1 belongs to the D band and G band of graphitic carbon. The intensity ratio of the D band to G band (ID/IG) changes from 0.95 of the P-MXene to 0.94, 1.00, 0.97 and 0.99 of the U-MXene, UH-MXene, H-MXene and HU-MXenes, respectively. These changes suggest the transformation between amorphous carbon and nanocrystalline graphite. In general, the transition from amorphous carbon to nanocrystalline graphite results in the increase of the ID/IG value. It has been well understood that the oxidation or reduction of some carbon materials can change the work function and the ID/IG ratio of graphene. Thus, the work function variation of MXenes by UV–ozone or N2H4 treatment may be related to the carbon atoms as well.

The Raman bands from 100 to 800 cm−1 arise from TiO2 of the MXene. The Raman band near 600 cm−1 is attributed to the Ti–O stretching vibration. This band is sensitive to the treatments. It appears at 611 cm−1 for the P-MXene. This can be assigned to the A1g mode of the TiO2 rutile phase. It shifts to 626 cm−1 after the UVO treatment. This value is higher than that of the A1g mode of the TiO2 rutile phase but lower than that of the Eg mode of the TiO2 anatase phase. This position shifts to 621 cm−1 when the U-MXene is further treated with N2H4. Probably, the treatments can affect the crystal structure of MXenes.
The effects of UVO and H2N4 treatments on MXenes films were studied by XPS as well (Fig. 5 and 6). The Ti 2p XPS spectra indicate the presence of TiO2 in all samples, consistent with the Raman spectra. The Ti 2p XPS spectra span from 453 to 468 eV for the P-MXene and H-MXenes. The deconvolution indicates the presence of Ti(II), Ti(IV) and Ti–C. The N2H4 treatment shifts the binding energies of C–Ti 2p1/2 and Ti(II) 2p1/2 from 463.1 and 461. 6 eV to 462.6 and 461.2 eV, respectively. The decrease in the binding energies can be ascribed to the presence of N in the MXene after the N2H4 treatment. As shown in Fig. S3, N doping of the MXene occurs after the H2N4 treatment. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XPS bands at 455.3 and 462.3 eV, which are assigned to Ti–N Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, changes from 1.221 and 1.955 eV to 1.373 and 2.310 eV, respectively.
However, only the Ti 2p XPS bands of TiO2 appear for the U-MXene, UH-MXene and HU-MXene samples. This indicates that the Ti atoms at the surface of the MXene films are oxidized to TiO2 by the UVO treatment. The appearance of TiO2 can also be observed by SEM (Fig. S4). The bright spots are TiO2 particles, and their density increases after an UVO treatment. As shown in Fig. S5, the further treatment of the U-MXene with H2N4 does not affect the Ti 2p XPS bands.
Control experiments were carried out to study the effect of N2H4 on the Ti 2p XPS bands of TiO2 prepared by the sol gel method. As shown in Fig. S6, N2H4 has no effect on the Ti 2p XPS bands of TiO2. This suggests that the N2H4 effect on the work function of the MXene cannot be attributed to the reduction of TiO2. This is consistent with the UPS study (Fig. S7). A treatment by UVO or N2H4 can only slightly change the work function by <0.1 eV. Hence, the work function variations of the MXenes should arise mainly from the effect of the treatments on the carbon element instead of TiO2.
The C element of the MXenes is investigated by XPS as well. Fig. 6 presents the C 1s XPS spectra of various MXene samples. The C 1s XPS bands of the P-MXene can be deconvoluted into C–Ti at 280.5 eV, C–C at 284.6 eV, C–O at 286.0 eV and O–CO at 288.5 eV. As shown in Fig. S8, the C 1s XPS band between 282 and 287 eV becomes wider after the H2N4 treatment. Because the N 1s XPS spectrum demonstrates the presence of N atoms induced by the H2N4 treatment, the widening in the C 1s XPS band should be related to the N doping.
The C 1s XPS band due to C–Ti disappears after the UVO treatment. This suggests that the C–Ti bonds are oxidized into Ti(IV)–O and C–O or O–CO. The increased (C–O + CO)/C–C ratio also leads to an elevated work function. The (C–O + O–CO)/C–C ratio increases from 0.25 for the P-MXene to 0.63, 1.07, 0.75 and 0.66 for the U-MXene, HU-MXene, H-MXene and UH-MXene, respectively. On the other hand, the intensity ratio C–N/(C–O + O–CO) is 0.45, 0.85 and 0.38, respectively for the H-MXene, UH-MXene and HU-MXene cases. Presumably, the reduction occurs for the graphitic carbon of the MXene. It is well known that N-doping occurs when graphene oxide is reduced with N2H4. The XPS intensity ratio of N/C is 0.181, 0.194 and 0.04 for the H-MXene, UH-MXene and HU-MXene. The N doping can be increased by the sequential UVO and N2H4 treatments. But the UVO treatment of an H-MXene lowers or even eliminates the N doping of the MXene.
In terms of the discussion above, we can conclude that the change in the work function of MXenes is similar to that of graphene. Oxidation of graphene can increase its work function up to 5.5 eV, whereas reduction of graphene oxide with N2H4 can lower the work function to 4.45 eV.

MXenes can have high transmittance in the visible range. As shown in Fig. S9, the U-MXene and UH-MXene with a thickness of 8 nm can have a transmittance of >92% in the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. Their transmittance is even slightly higher than that of PEDOT:PSS that is often used as a HTL for OSCs. The high transmittance together with the high conductivity and suitable work functions suggest that the U-MXene and UH-MXene can be used as the HTL and ETL, respectively, for OSCs.

PBDB-T:ITIC OSCs with MXenes were fabricated and characterized. The device architecture of the OSCs and the chemical structure of PBDB-T and ITIC are shown in Fig. 7. The U-MXene on ITO is used as the HTL in normal OSCs, whereas the UH-MXene on ITO is adopted as the ETL for inverted OSCs. The J–V curves of the optimized devices and energy diagram are shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d). Table 1 lists the photovoltaic parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE together with the shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs). The photovoltaic efficiencies are 9.02%, and 9.06% for the normal OSC with the U-MXene and the inverted OSC with the UH-MXene, respectively. These efficiencies are quite close to that (9.67%) of the control devices with PEDOT:PSS and Ca for the hole and electron collection, respectively. They are also similar to that of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC/Ca/Al reported in the literature.

The Voc value of the OSCs depends on the treatment conditions of the MXene thin films (Fig. 8). As mentioned above, UVO treatment can elevate the work function, whereas N2H4 treatment can lower the work function. Thus, the U-MXene and H-MXene can be used as the HTL and ETL in OPV devices, respectively. Their work functions depend on the treatment duration. Correspondingly, the Voc value of the OSCs using these materials can continuously increase with the increase of the treatment duration. In addition, the work function of the MXenes can be reversed. When the U-MXene is further treated with N2H4, its work function is lowered, and it can be thus used as an ETL instead of a HTL. Similarly, the further treatment of the H-MXene with UVO can increase its work function, and thus it can be used as a HTL instead of an ETL. Since Voc is related to the energy levels of the active layer and the electrode, the Voc values for OSCs using different MXenes are consistent with the work function of MXenes. Even though various methods were reported to change the work function of ITO, only a few methods could continuously tune its work function.
The film roughness can affect the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. AMF was used to investigate the surface roughness of the U-MXene and UH-MXene on ITO substrates (Fig. 9). The roughnesses of ITO, ITO/PEDOT:PSS, ITO/U-MXene and ITO/UH-MXene are 2.546, 1.238 and 3.919 and 4.630 nm, respectively.

MXenes were synthesized by etching 0.5 g MAX phase (400 mesh, purchased from 11 Technology Co. Ltd) with a mixture of 0.8 g LiF and 10 mL 9 M HCl for 28 h at room temperature. Subsequently, they were rinsed with deionized (DI) water repeatedly till the pH value became 5–6. The solution was then sonicated at a power of 350 W for 1 h in an ice bath. The MXene suspension was collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 20 min.

MXene thin films on substrates were prepared by spin coating their aqueous solution. They were then transferred to a glove box filled with highly pure nitrogen and annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, they were taken out from the glove box. The UV–ozone treatment was carried out in a Jelight UV–ozone cleaner, and the N2H4 treatment was performed in a sealed Petri dish containing N2H4 vapor.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected using an Asylum Research Multi-Mode AFM in the AC mode and a Philips scanning electron microscope, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 Advance XRD Instrument. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer or a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were obtained with an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) and He I (21.2 eV), respectively. Surface potential images were collected with an MFP-3D Atomic Force Microscope by Asylum Research in the Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) tapping mode. A Pt-coated cantilever tip with a radius of 15 nm and a spring constant of 2 N m−1 and a resonant frequency of ∼70 kHz (Electric-Lever, Olympus, Japan) were used for the measurements. The measurements were performed in Ar with an AC voltage of 3 V and a lift height of 10 nm. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out on aqueous solutions of 0.0013 wt% PEDOT:PSS or 0.005 mg mL−1 MXene with a Zetasizer Nano ZS by Malvern equipped with a HeNe laser (633 nm) as the light source. The Raman spectra were collected in a back scattering configuration using a Jobin Yvon Horiba LabRam HR800 Raman system with an Ar laser of 514.5 nm as the excitation source.


The OSCs using MXenes of high work function as hole-transport layers (HTLs) were fabricated by the following procedure. MXene films were prepared on pre-cleaned ITO substrates by spin coating. They were then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min in a glove box. After cooling down to room temperature, they were taken out from the glove box and treated in an UVO oven for 1 h. The ITO substrates coated with HTLs were then transferred into the glove box for the active layer coating. The active layer was deposited by coating a chlorobenzene (CB) solution consisting of 10 mg mL−1 poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T), 10 mg mL−1 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) and 0.5 vol% (1,8-diiodooctane) (DIO) at 2500 rpm for 1 min and then annealed on a hot plate. The devices were completed through the sequential thermal deposition of 40 nm-thick Ca and 100 nm-thick Al in a vacuum of <2 × 10−6 mbar.

Control OSCs with PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) as the HTL were fabricated through the same procedure. The PEDOT:PSS layer on ITO was prepared by spin coating the PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion at 5000 rpm for 1 min followed by annealing at 140 °C for 10 min in air.
Inverted OSCs were fabricated by using the UVO-then-N2H4 treated MXene as the electron transport layer (ETL). The ETL was prepared by treating an UVO-treated MXene film in a N2H4 vapor bath at 60 °C for 2 h. The PBDB-T:ITIC layer was deposited on the MXene layer by spin coating and annealed at 60 °C for 10 min. The devices were completed through the sequential thermal deposition of 15 nm-thick MoO3 and 100 nm-thick Al in a vacuum of <2 × 10−6 mbar.
The active area of each OSC was 0.11 cm2. The OSCs were tested in air with a computer-programmed Keithley 2420 source/meter and a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which simulated the AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and certified to the JIS C 8912 standard. The light source was calibrated with a standard silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1133).

The work function of Ti3C2Tx can be varied in a range from 4.08 to 4.95 eV through a treatment with UVO or N2H4. The UVO treatment can increase while the N2H4 treatment can lower the work function. The mechanisms for the work function variations are ascribed to the oxidation or reduction of the C element of Ti3C2Tx by UVO or N2H4, respectively. The MXene films with different work functions are studied as an ETL and HTL for non-fullerene PBDB-T:ITIC OSCs. The OSCs with MXenes can exhibit PCEs comparable to those of control OSCs using conventional charge-collection buffer materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the application of MXenes in optoelectronic devices is investigated. Due to their high transparency in the visible range and high conductivity, MXenes can have important applications in optoelectronic devices.
