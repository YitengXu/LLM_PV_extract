Toxicity of lead is one of the main hindrances to the commercial application of lead-based halide perovskite solar cells. The best choice to solve this problem of toxicity is to change the perovskite materials from lead-based to tin-based. However, the development of tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) was slow during the past few years due to their low power conversion efficiency (PCE) which is caused by the existence of Sn4+ and too fast crystallization of the perovskite during fabrication. Here, for the first time, we introduced an additive of hydrazine dihydrochloride (N2H4·2HCl) powder into the precursor solution of mixed organic cation all-tin perovskite (FA0.75MA0.25SnI3). The addition of the hydrazine salt effectively inhibited the oxidation of Sn2+ into Sn4+ in the perovskite film and adjusted the crystallization process at the same time. By optimizing the concentration of the additive, we finally obtained a PCE of 9.26% with good reproducibility and stability. After 55 days of storage in a N2-filled glovebox, the unencapsulated device retained ∼90% of the initial efficiency. What is gratifying is that the introduction of the additive also greatly reduced the hysteresis of the devices compared with devices without any additives. Our work shows that the introduction of a small amount of additive into the all-tin perovskite precursor can greatly improve the performance of TPSCs.

Lead-based halide perovskites have been extensively studied due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Recently, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 25%, showing strong commercialization potential. However, lead-based halide perovskites pose a huge threat to the ecological environment because of their rich content of toxic lead element. This threat is one of the reasons that prevent the transition of perovskite solar cells from the laboratory to practical application. Therefore, it is imperative to expand and develop green and efficient perovskite solar cells. Among the many non-toxic elements, only tin, which is in the same main group as lead, is the best choice to replace lead because of its similar structure and chemical properties to lead. The band gap of lead-based perovskites is usually between 1.5 and 1.8 eV, and greater than 1.34 eV, which is believed to be an ideal value for single junction solar cells. For tin-based perovskites, their band gap is between 1.2 and 1.4 eV. In particular, FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 mixed organotin iodine perovskite has a slightly narrower band gap (∼1.3 eV), which is expected to give a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc). On the one hand, the theoretical PCE is very close to 33%. On the other hand, from the perspective of environmental protection, tin is a less toxic element than lead. Based on the above, it is the environment-friendliness and excellent semiconductor characteristics of tin-based perovskite materials that have been extensively studied for light-absorbing layers. In just a few years, the PCE of tin-based perovskite solar cells has exceeded 12%, showing great development potential and good application prospects. However, the efficiency of all-tin perovskite cells reported in the literature is far less than that of lead-containing perovskite cells. The reasons for this low performance can be attributed to three aspects: (1) the divalent Sn2+ ions are easily oxidized to Sn4+ to form deep energy level defects, increasing the probability of recombination in the film and increased energy loss; (2) the reaction between the tin halide compound and the organic amine salt is too fast, which causes too fast crystallization of the perovskite, resulting in a smaller grain size of the perovskite film; (3) unfavourable energy level matching between the perovskite film and the charge transport layer. In order to improve the PCE of tin-based perovskite solar cells, many strategies and methods have been adopted to solve the problems faced by tin-based perovskite materials, including solvent engineering, composition engineering, crystal growth control, and additives. Liu et al. studied the effect of different anti-solvents on the crystallization kinetics of FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 and found that using chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent can effectively promote crystal crystallization. Zhao et al. explored the effect of different organic cation mixing ratios on performance and obtained a PCE of 8.12%. Recently, Cao et al. proposed a simple seed growth method to obtain high-quality tin-based perovskite films with preferential crystal orientation, large grain size, and fewer apparent grain boundaries. Among them, the suppression of Sn4+ in tin-based perovskite and the regulation of perovskite crystallization can be achieved by simply incorporating additives. For example, reducing additives such as tin powder, hydroxylsulfonate, and hypophosphorous acid and its salts can effectively inhibit the production of Sn4+; also, phenylhydrazine and in situ-generated Sn(0) nanoparticles can remove Sn(IV) impurities effectively, thereby obtaining high efficiency devices. By incorporating PPAI, EAI, RbCl, and so on, the crystallization process of tin-based perovskites can be controlled to form a higher quality perovskite film. Among these additives, the halide salt of hydrazine can not only inhibit the formation of Sn4+, but also improve the crystallization of the perovskite, thereby effectively improving the performance of the device. The halide salts of hydrazine such as hydrazine hydrochloride (N2H5Cl) and hydrazine monobromide (N2H5Br) have been used in tin-based perovskite and have achieved good results. However, there are many types of hydrazine halide salt, and many articles only simply refer to the reducing properties of hydrazine. No further studies have been conducted on the performance enhancement of the device caused by halogen ions and acidity of hydrazine salts.

Here, we firstly introduced hydrazine dihydrochloride (N2H4·2HCl) powder into a tin-based mixed organic cation perovskite precursor solution. The hydrazine salt (hereafter abbreviated as HD when dissolved in the precursor solution) has proven to be a successful additive in this study. Compared with N2H5Cl and N2H5Br, HD carries more hydrogen ions, and the stronger acidic environment coupled with the reducibility of N2H4 makes the formation of Sn4+ difficult to occur on the one hand. On the other hand, the moderate chlorine can effectively regulate crystallization and form larger grains in the process of spin coating and annealing. As a result, the optimized device has an optimum efficiency of 9.26% in the reverse scan under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) irradiation. In addition, the stability of the devices based on HD is better than that reported in most of the literature, and the PCE of the unencapsulated device after 30 days of storage in a N2-filled glovebox has negligible attenuation, showing excellent stability. Very encouragingly, the rate of hysteresis in the fabricated TPSCs with HD is significantly reduced. This paper provides a simple and effective strategy for improving the performance of TPSCs.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios PVP Al 4083), C60, bathocuproine (BCP), formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Co., Ltd.; 99.99% pure stannous iodide(II), N2H5Cl and N2H4·2HCl were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.; 99.999% ultra-dry stannous iodide(II) was purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., Ltd.; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%) and stannous fluoride (SnF2, 99.9%) were purchased from J&K Scientific Technology Co., Ltd.


FAI (103.2 mg), MAI (31.8 mg), SnI2 (298.4 mg) and SnF2 (12.6 mg) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMSO (200 μL) and DMF (800 μL), and then 1.31, 2.62, 5.25 and 10.49 mg powder of N2H4·2HCl were added to 1 mL FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 precursor solution to make 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 M addition in FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 precursor solution, respectively. The solutions were placed on a 60 °C hotplate to stir them overnight; then the precursor solution was filtered with a 0.22 μm PTFE filter before spin coating.


The ITO glass substrate (sheet resistance is about 7–9 Ω sq−1, thickness is ∼180 nm) was cleaned with Decon 90 cleaning solvent, then ultrasonically soaked in deionized water and ethanol for 30 minutes. The UV-ozone treatment was used for cleaning the ITO glass substrate for 15 min, and then high-pressure nitrogen was used to blow off the moisture on the substrate. The PEDOT:PSS solution filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon filter was spin-coated on the surface of the ITO substrate at 7000 rpm for 40 s, and then annealed at 140 °C for 20 min, after which the PEDOT:PSS coated substrate was cooled to room temperature and transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 6000 rpm for 40 s. During the spin-coating, 200 μL anti-solvent of chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the film. After the spin-coating was completed, the film was quickly transferred to a 100 °C hotplate for annealing for 20 minutes. Then, in a 10−5 Pa high vacuum evaporation system, 30 nm C60, 7 nm BCP, and 100 nm Ag metal electrode were thermally deposited sequentially on top of the perovskite layer. Finally, the device with an effective area of 0.065 cm2 is formed.


A field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7800F) was used to obtain the SEM image and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the perovskite film with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the perovskite film was measured with an XRD-7000 diffractometer produced by Shimadzu, Japan. The thickness of the films was probed using a contact step meter produced by Kosaka Laboratory, Japan. The absorption value of the film was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450 absorption spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the film was performed using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi. The pH of N2H4·2HCl and N2H5Cl solutions was obtained by using a pH meter. The CV was tested in 0.01 M PBS solution with Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. Using the Keithley 2400 source meter, the current–voltage curve of the solar cell was obtained under 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight with the scanning range from +0.8 to −0.2 V. When measuring the transient photo-voltage, the cells were connected directly in series with an oscilloscope (Agilent DSO-X02A) and the input impedance of the DSO was switched to 106 Ω.


In previous reports, hydrazine halides were used in tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) due to their reducibility to improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cell devices. In this work, similar to N2H5Cl, N2H4·2HCl was used as a new reductive additive in mixed cationic tin-based perovskite FA0.75MA0.25SnI3. Fig. 1a shows the XRD results of films fabricated by a one-step method from FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 precursor solutions with different concentrations (0, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 M) of HD. The main diffraction peaks are at 13.8°, 24.3°, 28.1°, 31.7° and 40.4° which belong to the (100), (120), (200), (122) and (222) crystal planes, respectively, indicating the orthorhombic crystal structure of the perovskite. Compared with the control film without HD, the diffraction peak intensity of the film with HD additive is significantly enhanced. Among them, the film with 0.025 M HD has the greatest enhancement at peaks of (100) and (200). The enhanced sharper peak (the full-width at half-maximum is 0.10°, compared to the 0.13° of the control film) indicates that the introduction of HD into the perovskite precursor does enhance the crystallinity of the film significantly. In addition, it is worth noting that with the gradual increase in the content of HD, an angle shift at the positions of 13.8° and 28.1° can be observed as shown in ESI Fig. S1, indicating that some hydrazinium ions were unavoidably incorporated into the perovskite lattice. This is possible because the ionic radii of N2H5+ and MA+ are similar, which can form the ternary mixed cation FAxMAyHAzSnI3 tin-based perovskite (FA+ = CH(NH2)2+, MA+ = CH3NH3+, HA+ = NH2NH3+).

Next, in order to study the effect of HD on the optical properties of perovskite films, we further tested the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the perovskite film with different HD additions (Fig. 1b). It can be seen from the UV-Vis spectra that the HD-containing perovskite presents a very small variation compared to the control film. However, the absorption edges red shift with the increase of HD additive. The band gaps of the perovskite material calculated from the Tauc plots are 1.325, 1.320, 1.309, 1.296 and 1.286 eV, respectively, for the 0, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 M HD additions (Fig. 1c). Such successively decreasing band gap indicates that the composition of the perovskite has been changed by HD, which is in line with the reported results.
The quality of the perovskite film morphology is one of the determined factors of the device performance. A smooth, compact and low porosity perovskite film is a prerequisite for good performance. In the SEM shown in Fig. 2, the morphology of the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite film without additive shows small and not evenly distributed crystal grains. In addition, there are many white spots on the perovskite film. The white spots are caused by the phase separation caused by the excessive SnF2 in the precursor. This phase separation is not conducive to the perovskite nucleation and crystallization, having an adverse effect on device performance. When 0.0125 M HD is added, the crystal grains in the film become larger and denser. Upon further increasing the hydrazine salt concentration to 0.025 M, a compact film is formed with even larger crystals, which is confirmed by the grain size distribution presented in Fig. S2. This result is believed to be caused by the more stable mesophase and reduced crystallization rate after adding more hydrazine salts, in good agreement with the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1a.
The white spots disappear in the film with the 0.025 M additive, which can be attributed to hydrazine salt due to its ability to inhibit the phase separation caused by SnF2. However, a further increase in HD concentration (≥0.05 M) will result in slightly decreased grain size and more grain boundaries. Such grain boundaries can lead to larger leakage currents and serve as carrier recombination centers, which will eventually decrease the device performance. In addition, an AFM was employed to estimate the surface roughness of the corresponding perovskite samples (Fig. S3). It could be seen that the roughness of the film gradually increases from 20.3 nm without additive to 35.8 nm with 0.05 M HD. The increased roughness improves the light capturing ability of the perovskite film, allowing the device to achieve larger Jsc and better performance. However, the enlarged roughness is not the main reason for the enhanced performance, which can be corroborated via the UV-Vis absorption spectra. In Fig. S3, similar to the SEM, the grain size was enhanced considerably upon introducing HD; especially, the perovskite film with 0.025 M HD exhibited the best crystallinity. When the concentration of HD was further increased, in spite of the elevated size of grains for adding 0.05 and 0.1 M HD, the grain boundaries and defects which serve as carrier recombination centres become more and more evident, unfavorable for the performance enhancement.
The choice of HD is based on its good reducibility to prevent or retard the oxidation of Sn2+ in the precursor solution and ability of regulating crystallization. The reducibility and effects on performance improvement of TPSCs were systematically studied as follows. According to the Gibbs free energy equation, the reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ is spontaneous in an acidic environment (eqn (S1)); hence, an acidic environment is beneficial to inhibit the transfer from Sn4+ to Sn2+. First, we investigated the pH of perovskite precursor solutions with various concentrations of HD as shown in Table S1a. Compared to the perovskite precursor without any additive, the adding of HD distinctly changed the pH of the precursor, from an initial 5.8 without HD to 4.4 with 0.1 M HD. To confirm the higher acidity of the solution with HD having two hydrochloric acid moieties, the pH values of the perovskite precursor with the same molar concentration of N2H5Cl are compared with HD-added ones. Indeed, Table S1b in the ESI shows the slightly higher pH of N2H5Cl-added precursors.
To differentiate the roles between HD and N2H5Cl, we compared the colour change of the two SnI2 (99.99%) solutions by introducing equivalent concentrations of HD and N2H5Cl under ambient conditions with 40% relative humidity (Fig. 3). The three bottles are SnI2 solutions without additive (No. 1), with 0.025 M N2H5Cl (No. 2) and with 0.025 M HD (No. 3), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the solution colour without additive changes from its initial deep yellow to reddish brown after 3 hours, which can be attributed to the presence of increasing Sn4+ in the solution, indicating the oxidation of Sn2+. In contrast, both solutions with additives (either N2H5Cl or HD) virtually do not change their colour after 6 hours of storage, indicating the inhibition of Sn2+ oxidation. After being kept for 10 hours, the colour of the solution with N2H5Cl additive (No. 2) turned slightly reddish brown while the solution with HD additive (No. 3) only shows negligible colour change. Based on previous research, the reduction mechanism of hydrazine salt in the precursor solution of a tin-based perovskite can be explained by the following equation:
N2H4 + 2SnI62− → 2SnI42− + N2 + 4HI
Apparently, the most obvious difference between HD and N2H5Cl is the value of pH. From what has been described above, we have initially attributed the strong antioxidant properties of HD to the more acidic properties of HD, which restrains the spontaneous oxidation of Sn2+ in acidic medium. The CV curves of N2H5Cl and HD were recorded under the same conditions (Fig. S4), in which HD shows lower reduction potential than N2H5Cl; such result may derive from the generation of an incomplete mixture of hydrazine salt (N2H4)m(HCl)n, resulting in stronger reducibility compared to N2H5Cl.
To quantitatively analyse the content of Sn2+ and Sn4+ ions in the tin-based perovskite precursor solutions, we conducted XPS tests on the films prepared under the same conditions. The four XPS peaks shown in Fig. 4 can be decomposed into components related to Sn2+ and Sn4+, respectively. Detailed XPS related data are presented in Table S2. It can be clearly observed that the Sn4+ ion in the film is significantly reduced from 31.5% in the control film to 9.6% after introducing 0.025 M HD. The reduction of Sn4+ could be expected owing to the partially remaining or formed imperfect mixture of hydrazine salt (N2H4)m(HCl)n. The small amount of Sn4+ in the HD added film may originate from Sn2+ oxidation during the preparation of the precursor solution, impurities in the SnI2 source, spin-coating process, or/and thermal annealing step. The presence of Sn4+ ions will cause deep-level defects in the film and change the structure of the perovskite, greatly reducing the device performance.
Next, we prepared devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA0.75MA0.25SnI3/C60/BCP/Ag, as schematically shown in Fig. 5a with the energy level alignment in Fig. 5b. Fig. 5c and Table 1 show the current–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters in the reverse scan under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. When HD was introduced, the Jsc and fill factor (FF) of all devices increased significantly, from 68.11% to 72.81% for FF, and from 19.79 to 21.93 mA cm−2 for Jsc, which is consistent with its enhanced incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) over the entire wavelength range shown in Fig. 5d. Further IPCE plots of various concentrations of HD devices are shown in Fig. S5. Very encouragingly, the PCE increased from 7.05% for the control device to 9.26% for the device with 0.025 M HD. To deeply understand the effect of HD, the corresponding devices with N2H5Cl additive were measured (Fig. S6 and Table S3). It can be corroborated that the HD-based devices present better performance compared to devices with the same concentration of N2H5Cl. To the best of our knowledge, the hydrochloric acid is linked by intermolecular forces, either in N2H5Cl or in HD. When dissolved in the tin-based perovskite precursor solution as an additive, the stronger acid offered by HD can effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+, while the moderate chlorine regulates the crystallization process. The synergy between the chlorine and acidity improves the quality of perovskite films, indicating the superiority of HD.

To understand the reasons for the enhanced Jsc of perovskite solar cells with HD as an additive, we first explored the effect of HD on film thickness (Table S4). The result shows that HD in a perovskite film does not distinctly change the viscosity of the precursor and then thickness of the film, proving that the increase in Jsc is not achieved by adjusting the thickness of the film. The XPS spectra of the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 film with 0.025 M HD and EDS mapping (Fig. S7 and S8) confirm the absence of chlorine ions, indicating the volatilization of chlorine during high temperature annealing. To clarify the role of HD introduced into the precursor solution and measured the corresponding device PCE. Although the Jsc of TPSCs was increased after incorporation of SnCl2, the Voc and the FF decreased, triggering the deterioration of efficiency substantially. The result (Fig. S9 and Table S5) shows that the introduction of chlorine ions alone could not enhance the PCE.
Furthermore, we measured the performance of the perovskite devices under various light intensities to estimate the ideality factor n (Fig. 6a). The lower the n value the less recombination in the device. The light intensity dependent Voc is given below:
(1)
where
n is the ideality factor, q is the electronic charge, T is temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and Voc is the open circuit voltage obtained under different light intensities φ. The ideality factors of perovskite solar cells with 0.025 M HD and without additive are 1.29 and 1.41, respectively, indicating lower trap-assisted recombination of the device with 0.025 M HD. Accordingly, the presence of fewer recombination centres in the device with 0.025 M HD is further confirmed by the transient photo-voltage (TPV) measurements. As shown in Fig. 6b, the slower decay of TPV caused by the reduced traps and defects is clearly observed for the device with additive. Then, the electron-only structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag was used to measure the trap-state density Nt in the perovskite film (Fig. 6c) by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The Nt can be calculated using the following equation:

(2)
where
q is the elementary charge, L is the perovskite film thickness, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the relative dielectric constant (ε is usually 35 for perovskite materials), and VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region. The VTFL of the sample without HD is 0.35 V, corresponding to a high trap-state density of 3.39 × 1019 cm−3. When HD was introduced, the VTFL of the device reduced to 0.25 V; correspondingly, the trap-state density was 2.42 × 1019 cm−3, which indicates clearly better film quality with fewer bulk defects in the perovskite film. Furthermore, dark current was conducted to prove that the HD-based perovskite film possesses lower leakage current which can be ascribed to the higher quality film with fewer pinholes and traps, as shown in Fig. 2c. When HD is introduced into the device, not only will the Jsc of the solar cell be significantly increased, but the Voc will also be slightly increased. Such an improvement in voltage can be explained by the inhibition of Sn2+ and thus reduced defect density.

Besides, we also found that the reproducibility of HD-containing TPSCs was much higher than that of the control devices. Two batches of solar cells with and without HD have been fabricated. The measured PCEs of 18 devices from each batch are statistically shown in Fig. 7a. The efficiency of the control device is between 5.40% and 7.05% with an average efficiency of 6.54%. When 0.025 M HD is introduced, the average efficiency is 8.66% with good reproducibility. The better device efficiency between 7.64% and 9.26% can be mainly ascribed to the reduction capability of HD to inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ in the precursor solution. Moreover, the hysteresis analysis of TPSCs is given in Fig. 7b. The almost negligible hysteresis of the HD-containing TPSCs can be attributed to the lower defect density, which can delay ion migration in perovskite films.
The stability of devices with and without HD additive was also compared. As shown in Fig. 7c, the output at the maximum power point of the 0.025 M HD device under simulated sunlight is much more stable than that of the control device. Then, the PCEs of the control device and the device with 0.025 M HD additive were traced in a N2-filled glovebox as shown in Fig. 7d. It is found that after 60 days of storage, the 0.025 M HD device shows excellent stability, which can be attributed to the dense crystal that effectively blocks the oxidation of Sn2+ caused by the trace oxygen in the glovebox. The thermal stabilities of the two devices were also tested in a glovebox on a hotplate at 85 °C. As shown in Fig. S10, only a very small PCE decrease can be observed for the 0.025 M HD device compared to the control device. This improved stability originates from the less oxidation of Sn2+ and fewer formed defects during the preparation of the device, which reduce the paths for ion migration.

In this work, we introduced hydrazine dihydrochloride into the mixed organic cation tin-based perovskite FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 precursor for the first time, and proved that this additive can effectively improve the performance of the TPSCs by reducing the concentration of Sn4+ in the precursor solution and inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+ during the device manufacturing process. In addition, because HD has stronger acidity than N2H5Cl, on the one hand, it can effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ ions, so that the device can maintain better stability for a long time. On the other hand, the chlorine in HD can promote the formation of dense and compact perovskite films, and the effect of hydrazine ions can effectively eliminate the phase separation caused by SnF2. Finally, the planar heterojunction solar cell fabricated from the FA0.75MA0.25SnI3 perovskite precursor with 0.025 M HD achieved a maximum PCE of 9.26%. In addition, the stability of TPSCs treated with HD was tested in a N2-filled glovebox. The initial efficiency of ∼90% was maintained after 55 days, and almost no attenuation was observed when heated on a hot plate at 85 °C for 100 minutes. This work provides a new and effective strategy for preparing high efficiency TPSCs. It is believed that further optimization of the energy level configuration and regulation of crystallization kinetics can make TPSCs more efficient and more stable.
