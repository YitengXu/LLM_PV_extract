We report highly efficient small molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) based on a porphyrin derivative electron donor of ZnP2-DPP and an electron acceptor of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) by using a solvent vapor annealing (SVA) method with a series of low boiling solvents. Absorption spectral studies indicate that carbon disulfide (CS2) SVA induces J-aggregation in blend films accompanied by expanded and enhanced absorption which contributes largely to the fabrication of broader light response and larger short-circuit current (JSC) solar cell devices. In addition, we systematically analyze the relationship between the film morphology and device performance. Finally, the electronic study shows that the CS2 SVA-treated device showed a higher exciton generation rate and enhanced carrier collection efficiency. And the morphology study indicates that the blend films treated with CS2 SVA exhibit tighter molecular packing, better crystallization and an appropriate phase separation length scale. In other words, these collective electronic and morphological features correlate well with the champion JSC, the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the CS2 treated devices.

Advances in materials science have contributed to the development of clean energy production and energy storage technologies, as well as to improvement in the ecological environment. Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) are very promising alternatives to inorganic devices in generating low-cost renewable energy. Small molecule photovoltaic donor materials have attracted much attention due to their many advantages such as easier purification, well-defined molecular structures and low batch-to-batch variation compared to their polymer donor counterparts. Recent progress in material design, the optimization of device structures and enhanced morphology control has led to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 10% in solution processed BHJ small molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs). However, the PCEs of most SM-OSCs are still lower than those of polymer cells because of the limited understanding of the morphology control and manipulation in the fabrication of active layers. As we know, the exciton generation and separation, and carrier transportation and collection taking place inside the active layer are largely responsible for the device performance. Some fabrication processes such as additive processing, thermal annealing (TA) and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) are effective in changing the molecular crystallization and orientation and controlling the phase separation, domain size and domain purity of active layers. For example, Heeger et al. reported SM-OSCs based on a small molecule 5,5′-bis((4-(7-hexylthiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine)-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (DTS(PTTh2)2). The PCE was enhanced from 4.5% to 6.7% and the nano-morphology of the domains of the blend films decreased from 20–30 nm dimensions to 15–20 nm in size when using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive. Wang et al. reported multifluorine substituted oligomer BIT6F-based SM-OSCs with a PCE of 9.09% when the active layer was treated with TA + SVA. The performance enhancement was because the crystalline content and phase separation increased after SVA or TA + SVA treatment which allowed the molecules to move and order.

Of all optimization methods known to influence the morphology of an active layer, SVA treatment is regarded as being especially efficient to SM-OSCs. In SVA treatment, the active layer is exposed to a container saturated with solvent vapor. And the solvent vapor can diffuse into the blends and drastically lower the glass transition temperatures of the materials, and thus the molecules in the blends gain high mobility to reorganize into lower energy states. As a result, this could change the molecular crystallization and orientation, and promote the aggregation of both donor and acceptor molecules. The improved phase purity and the increased phase separation length scale to a suitable state are beneficial for better device performance.
In organic conjugated molecules, the expansion of π-conjugation could enhance self-aggregation through intermolecular π–π interactions. The inter-chain coulombic interactions of the molecule assemblies always lead to the formation of H-aggregates, whereas intra-chain through-bond interactions lead to the formation of J-aggregates. Compared with the absorption in solution, the blue-shift of a film's absorption indicates that the molecule prefers H-aggregation. And J-aggregation always shows an ordered molecular packing in one dimension and results in significant red-shift absorption with increased intensity. And the expanded and enhanced absorption in J-aggregation-based films provides a potential chance to fabricate broader light response and larger short-circuit current (JSC) solar cell devices.
Some porphyrin derivatives are near-infrared (NIR) organic semiconductors with optical bandgaps less than 1.5 eV and have attracted much attention due to their great contribution to the field of NIR photodetectors, SM-OSCs, ternary solar cells and tandem solar cells. In this contribution, we report dimer porphyrin molecule ZnP2-DPP (Fig. 1) based SM-OSCs and use SVA treatment with chloroform (CF), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), carbon disulfide (CS2) or tetrahydrofuran (THF) to control the thin film morphology and the optimize charge transport. The optimized devices show a high power conversion efficiency of 9.47% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.64 V, a fill factor (FF) of 69.14% and an impressively high JSC of 21.40 mA cm−2 due to the strong absorption beyond 1000 nm of J-aggregation features induced by CS2 SVA. The electronic study shows that the CS2 SVA-treated device showed a higher exciton generation rate and enhanced carrier collection efficiency. And the morphology study indicates that the blend film treated with CS2 SVA exhibits tighter molecular packing, better crystallization and an appropriate phase separation length scale.

The SM-OSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ZnP2-DPP:PC61BM/PFN-Br/Al (PFN-Br: poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide). The fabrication process is shown in the ESI.Fig. 2a shows the J–V curve of the solar cell devices with or without SVA and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1 and Tables S1–S4 (ESI). For devices based on the as-cast film, the JSC and the FF are extremely low, leading to an inferior efficiency of only 1.70%. Surprisingly, the JSC and FF are obviously improved for all the SVA treated devices. Due to the low JSC of 9.47 mA cm−2, THF treated devices show a moderate PCE of 4.42% despite their high FF of 66.20% and VOC of 0.705 V. And for the devices treated with CH2Cl2, the JSC is dramatically enhanced to 18.20 mA cm−2. Unfortunately, the FF of the device is still less than 60%, which limited the improvement of PCE. For the devices treated with CF or CS2, the FF and the PCE of both devices exceed 67% and 8%, respectively. In particular, the champion PCE of 9.47% is obtained with an impressive JSC of 21.40 mA cm−2, a high FF of 69.14% and a VOC of 0.64 V.

In order to understand the big differences in JSC and PCE of these devices, we measured the absorption spectra and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. The absorption of this molecule in solution shows a narrow peak at 789 nm and the absorption of the as-cast film shows a peak at 844 nm with an obvious red-shift of 55 nm, indicating good stacking and self-assembly properties of ZnP2-DPP (Fig. S1, ESI). We used ZnP2-DPP and PC61BM at a weight ratio of 1:1 to fabricate active layers of solar cells. When preparing the blend films under different solvent vapor annealing processing conditions, there are big differences in the films’ color which can easily be recognized by the naked eye, indicating that the absorption of these films changes significantly after treatment with different solvents. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2b, while the CH2Cl2 SVA treated film shows an absorption peak at the same position of 844 nm as that of the as-cast film, an apparent shoulder peak can be seen at 795 nm. For the blend film treated with CS2 SVA, the maximum absorption peak dramatically red-shifts to 896 nm and the absorption shoulder at 795 nm is more obvious. Such a broad absorption is beneficial for the solar cell devices to absorb more sunlight, resulting in a larger photocurrent. Compared with that of the as-cast film, the absorption of the THF SVA treated film only shows a moderate red-shift of 11 nm to 855 nm. In contrast, for the film treated with CF SVA, this absorption peak blue-shifts to 768 nm, which is even blue-shifted compared with the absorption in the solution (Fig. S2, ESI). Such a blue-shift is generally considered as H-aggregation, which could be attributed to the parallel alignment of the molecular dipole moments.
The EQE curves of the solar cells based on different solvent treatments are shown in Fig. 2c. Obviously, the as-cast device and the THF-treated device show a weak light response in the whole region possibly because of the well-mixed donor and acceptor and the severe phase separation length scale (vide infra). The EQE values of the other three devices enhanced significantly and the shapes of the EQE curves are similar to those of their corresponding film absorption. The EQE curve of the CS2-treated device shows a significant red shift when compared to the curve of the CF-treated device. The integrated current density from the EQE curve is 20.52 mA cm−2, which is similar to the measured value.
Single carrier devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ZnP2-DPP:PC61BM/MoO3/Al. And the dark J–V curves of the devices under different SVA treatments were obtained to evaluate the hole mobility using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method, and are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S5 (ESI). While the as-cast device shows a low hole mobility of 1.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, THF and CH2Cl2 SVA treatments improve the hole mobilities of the devices to 3.01 × 10−5 and 8.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. In particular, CF and CS2 treated devices exhibited higher mobilities of 1.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which can contribute to the high JSC and FF of devices.
The photocurrent density (Jph) is plotted against the effective voltage (Veff) to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency of the cells. As shown in Fig. 2d, the CS2 treated device shows the highest Jph in low Veff, indicating the best carrier collection efficiency. Jph will be saturated (Jsat) when Veff is large enough. The maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of the solar cells can be calculated according to the equation Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The Gmax values for the CF and CS2 treated devices are 1.33 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.46 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. A higher Gmax is derived from the formed J-aggregates to enhance and broaden the absorption induced by CS2 SVA.
The surface morphology of the pristine and different solvent vapor annealing ZnP2-DPP:PC61BM blend thin films is investigated by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the images are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the blend films with CF, CH2Cl2, CS2 and THF SVA are 1.13, 0.41, 3.74 and 2.01 nm, respectively. In contrast, the as-cast film shows a very smooth surface with a RMS of only 0.28 nm, indicating the extremely well mixed porphyrin donor and acceptor, which can lead to severe charge recombination and therefore a low FF because an effective carrier transportation channel does not form. For the film treated with CF SVA, the surface roughness is obviously increased to 1.13 nm. And there were obvious aggregates with a RMS of 2.01 nm in the THF SVA treated film. In particular, the CS2 vapor treated film shows a rougher surface and characteristic fiber-like structures can be seen clearly in the height image, which might be due to the favorable crystallinity of porphyrin molecules.
In order to obtain more information on the nanoscale phase separation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of ZnP2-DPP:PC61BM blend thin films spin-coated on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates under different solvent vapor annealing processing conditions is performed and the corresponding images are shown in Fig. 3. The bright domains are ZnP2-DPP rich and the dark domains are PC61BM rich. A homogeneous morphology with unapparent nano-scale phase separation is seen in the as-cast film. Upon solvent vapor annealing, both the uniform mixture morphology and the length scale of phase separation are totally changed and the films display a quite different surface morphology. Worm-like structures can be seen in the CF vapor treated films, which is beneficial for exciton diffusion to the donor–acceptor interface and the concomitant exciton dissociation. In CH2Cl2 vapor treated films, the length scale of phase separation is slightly enlarged and there are no well-defined domains. In particular, the CS2 SVA treated film shows obvious fiber-like structures in the TEM image. Apparently, the formation of fiber-like structures is in line with the absorption investigation whereby J-aggregation is enhanced in the blends upon CS2 treatment. The well-defined morphology and suitable phase separation forming superior interpenetrating networks can contribute to the high charge transportation and therefore photovoltaic performance. There is no doubt that the solar cells treated by CS2 vapor annealing exhibit the highest FF of 69.14% and the largest PCE of 9.47%. However, obvious PC61BM dark domains larger than 100 nm appear in the THF SVA treated films. The lack of D/A interfaces for separating excitons leads to a low current density of 9.47 mA cm−2 for the corresponding devices.
Furthermore, we used grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the crystallinity and molecular packing of the films. Fig. 4a shows the diffraction patterns of the blend films upon different SVA treatments. Also, the corresponding profiles of the in plane and out of plane line-cut are shown in Fig. 4b and c. Broad diffraction rings at 1.3–1.5 Å−1 are seen in the diffraction patterns, which come from the combination of ZnP2-DPP intermolecular π–π stacking and PC61BM diffraction. However, further analysis is difficult due to the obvious overlaps of these two features. In the as-cast film, there are no obvious peaks in the q region from 0.2 to 0.4 Å−1, indicating the poor crystallinity and the structure order in the (100) direction. After SVA treatment, the molecules become ordered in the (100) direction. And a good crystal order for both CF and CS2 treated films is seen in this direction, which is also evidenced by the sharp peaks in the out of plane direction (Fig. 4c). There is also a subtle shift in the position of the (100) peak from 0.31 Å−1 in the CS2 treated film to 0.25 Å−1 in the CF treated film, indicating a smaller d-spacing of 2 nm in the CS2 treated films. The crystal coherence length (CCL) in the (100) direction for the CS2 treated film is 10.8 nm, which is slightly larger than that of the CF treated film according to Scherrer analysis. Therefore, the CS2 treated films exhibit a higher degree of molecular order, as proved by the tighter molecular packing, the larger crystal coherence length and even the appearance (200) of the reflection peak. However, for the CH2Cl2 treated film, a broad peak in the blend spectrum indicated that the ZnP2-DPP crystals are smaller than those in CF and CS2 treated films.
And the phase separation of these blend films was investigated by using resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS). Shown in Fig. 4d are the scattering profiles of the five blend films under different processing conditions. No obvious peaks and the very low scattering intensities of the as-cast film suggest the lack of phase separation due to the well-mixed ZnP2-DPP and PC61BM mediated by pyridine leading to severe bimolecular combination and therefore an extremely low FF for the corresponding solar cell devices. For the CH2Cl2 treated film, a broad hump in the regions from 0.01 to 0.06 Å−1 is seen, indicating that there is a continuous length scale of phase separation from 10 nm to 60 nm in this film. However, the low scattering intensity suggests the weak degree of phase separation, and as a result, the corresponding devices exhibit moderate FF and JSC values. In the THF treated film, the peak is at 0.005 Å−1, and the corresponding length scale of phase separation is about 125 nm, which is consistent with the TEM image showing that serious PC61BM aggregation exists in the film. A large number of excitons are recombined before diffusion to the interfaces, which is responsible for the low JSC of 9.47 mA cm−2. On the other hand, the separation length scales are 40 and 50 nm for the CS2 and the CF treated films, respectively. An appropriate phase separation scale is beneficial for solar cell devices with high JSC. Furthermore, the CS2 treated film shows a higher scattering intensity and a better phase purity. These collective morphological features correlate well with the champion JSC, FF and PCE of the CS2 treated devices.

In conclusion, we fabricated solar cells based on ZnP2-DPP:PC61BM blend films treated with a series of low boiling solvents and tested their photovoltaic efficiencies. Notably, a remarkable PCE of 9.47% and a high FF of 69.14% for CS2 treated devices were achieved because CS2 vapor reorganized ZnP2-DPP molecules and enhanced the J-aggregation of ZnP2-DPP, thereby increasing the crystallinity of the small molecules and forming a favorable film morphology with a fiber-like structure. Meanwhile, the enhanced J-aggregation of ZnP2-DPP molecules leads to enhanced absorption, photoelectric response and carrier transportation, which contributed to a very high JSC of 21.40 mA cm−2 of the solar cell device. The as-cast film shows a lack of phase separation due to the well-mixed blend of ZnP2-DPP and PC61BM. Severe recombination and limited carrier transport resulted in low JSC and FF, and thus an extremely low PCE of 1.70%. This result verified that a suitable SVA process is very important toward achieving high PCEs of small molecule solar cells.
