The emergence of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) recently has brought new hope to the solar cell industry due to their incredible improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which can now exceed 20.0% within seven years of tremendous research. The efficiency and stability of PSCs depend strongly on the morphology and type of materials selected as the electron transport layer (ETL) in the device. In this review, the functions of the ETL based on titania (TiO2) in n–i–p architecture PSCs, including planar heterojunction and mesoporous-structured devices, are reviewed in terms of the device performance and stability. Studies found that the application of suitable fabrication techniques and manipulation of the nanostructural properties of TiO2 are crucial factors in ameliorating the short-circuit current density, JSC, and fill factor, FF, of PSCs. On top of that, the effect of substituting TiO2 with other potential inorganic materials like zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO2), ternary metal oxides, and metal sulphides, as well as organic semiconductors including fullerene, graphene, and ionic liquids, towards the photovoltaic properties and stability of the devices are also elaborated and discussed. Meanwhile, the utilization of non-electron transport layers (non-ETLs), such as alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2), as the mesoporous scaffold in PSCs is found to enhance the open-circuit voltage, VOC, of the devices.

After he received his PhD, he was appointed as Research Fellow/Senior Lecturer in 2013 at the same university. Recent research activity has focused on the development and scale up of perovskite solar cells, polymer solar cells, and dye-sensitized solar cells, and at the same time he also developed a nanostructured electrode for solar cells and photocatalysis.

The rapid rise in energy consumption throughout the globe has pushed the renewable energy industry, especially solar photovoltaics, to explore better technologies to sustain electricity supplies. The first generation solar cell was based on silicon wafers, which are widely used in photovoltaic technology nowadays due to their high performance (about 15–20%) as well as high stability. Meanwhile, the second generation solar cells employed amorphous silicon or semiconducting materials, such as copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe), rather than silicon wafer to yield a typical efficiency of 10–15%. The third generation solar cells, which are also referred to as thin-film solar cells, utilized organic materials like small molecules or polymers as light harvesters that allowed the reduction of material consumption and thus minimized production costs.

After a few decades of research, the improvement on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the former generations of solar cell technologies have reached a plateau, while the production costs are still relatively high. Thus, the recent emergence of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) brings a new era to the solar cell industry due to their incredible improvement of the PCE, which can exceed 20.0% within seven years of tremendous research with economic production costs. The earliest application of perovskite materials was MAPbBr3 nanocrystals that were applied as semiconductor sensitizers in liquid electrolyte dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by Miyasaka et al. in 2009 where the fabricated device showed an efficiency of 3.1%. To date, the certified efficiency of PSCs has skyrocketed to 22.1%.
There are two types of PSC device architecture according to the arrangement of the precedent electron transport layer or hole transport layer that attributed to the n–i–p or p–i–n structure, respectively. The n–i–p type PSC can be further categorized into planar or mesoporous configurations based on the structure of the electron transport layer (ETL). Both device configurations in general consist of five different layers which are (i) the transparent conducting oxide (TCO), such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium tin oxide (ITO), (ii) the planar or mesoporous ETL, (iii) the light-absorbing layer based on perovskite materials, (iv) the hole transport material (HTM), and (v) the metal or non-metal electrode like gold (Au), silver (Ag), or carbon (C).Fig. 1 illustrates the device architectures of the n–i–p type PSCs with regards to the presence and structure forms of ETLs. The ETL free device is represented by Fig. 1a while Fig. 1b indicates the planar heterojunction of PSC where a layer of perovskite light harvester is sandwiched in between the compact ETL and HTM. Moreover, Fig. 1c depicts the mesoporous configuration of the PSC device without compact ETL, which is usually fabricated in the early generation of PSC. In the meantime, most high efficiency and stable PSCs are obtained based on the combination of compact and mesoporous ETLs (Fig. 1d).
In order to achieve a high performance PSC, the presence of an ETL is required to facilitate efficient electron collection and transportation from the perovskite layer to its respective electrodes. Even though several groups claimed to obtain a PCE of more than 13% for ETL free devices, the incorporation of ETL in PSCs is still dominant in terms of efficiency and stability of the devices. Juarez-Perez et al. compared the device performance of the complete PSCs with the ETL-free device and they observed that the absence of ETL has a minor impact on the open-circuit voltage (VOC), but severely reduced the short-circuit current density (JSC) as well as the fill factor (FF), which subsequently affected the PCE of the devices. The insertion of the ETL substantially increased the electron–hole recombination resistance (Rrec) at the expense of a small increment in the series resistance (RS). Zhang and co-workers also reported a reduction of 2.7% (absolute value) from its maximum PCE of 14.2% upon the removal of the ETL. Besides, they realized that an ETL-free planar PSC showed no sign of stabilized power output although the PCE achieved from current voltage measurement was quite high. It is also worth mentioning that the PCE of the ETL free device could reach up to 14.1%, but the complete cells exhibited superior efficiency of 16.1%, as reported by Ke et al.
In order to fabricate PSCs with high efficiency, the materials selected as the ETL must fulfil several criteria. The ETLs must possess (i) good electron mobility to enable fast electron transport within the ETL, (ii) a wide band gap to ensure high transparency and allow more light to pass through it so that light absorption by the perovskite materials can be maximized, and (iii) compatible energy levels where the ETL must have a compatible conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) in relation to the energy levels of the perovskite light harvester to facilitate electron transfer and block hole transport from the perovskite layer as well as to enhance the built-in potential. In addition to that, the semiconductor materials selected as the ETL in the planar heterojunction must have (i) good antireflection to avoid light scattering as well as reflection, which can reduce light transmittance, and (ii) compact structure that is free of pinholes to prevent direct contact between the perovskite and TCO, which tends to cause current leakage. On the other hand, the structure of the mesoporous ETL should be able to accommodate the infiltration of the perovskite nanocrystals into the scaffold. To date, a series of inorganic materials have been studied as potential ETLs in PSCs including titanium dioxide (TiO2), stannic oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), barium stannate (BaSnO3), and many others.
Even though PSCs originate from DSSCs, the architecture of the ETL in a PSC is completely different from its parent device. In a DSSC, a very thick mesoporous scaffold is necessary to enable high dye loading, but the mesoporous layer in the PSC is merely an optional layer, which is employed to enhance the electron extraction efficiency and minimize the hysteresis effect in the device. Furthermore, a mesoporous layer in a DSSC is typically built of a 10 μm thick layer of randomly dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles, while a highly efficient PSC comprises of only an about 200 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 film to generate a sufficient photocurrent. In contrast, the insertion of a compact ETL is very important in PSCs to prevent charge recombination at the perovskite/FTO interface whereas such a layer is usually not required in the DSSC device.
Generally, there are two main strategies that can be implemented to enhance the properties of ETLs. The first approach is through modifying the structure of the ETL, while the second approach is via the utilization of materials with better optical and electrical properties. For the first strategy, various nanostructural modifications of TiO2 as an ETL in the fabrication of n–i–p type PSCs will be reviewed. The TiO2-based ETLs are categorized into two major groups according to their basic configuration of the compact and mesoporous structures. The properties of nanostructured TiO2, including the electrical and optical properties, are studied and the structural modifications, such as morphology control, dimensionality, and the combination of multiple structures, as well as their influences on the device performances, are summarized accordingly. However, this review will exclude the effect of doping in order to provide better clarification of the importance of nanostructuring the ETL on the device performance and stability.
Meanwhile, the latter part of this review will discuss the effect of substituting TiO2 with various inorganic and organic semiconductors as an ETL on the device performances. The materials are divided into the electron transport layers (ETLs), which are mainly focused on ZnO and SnO2, as well as non-electron transport layers (non-ETLs) like alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2) and silica (SiO2). This review differs from previous literature as it systematically explains the effect of modifying numerous parameters on the construction of the ETL using pure semiconductors, so that highly efficient and stable PSCs can be fabricated and commercialized in the future.

Since PSCs originated from DSSC technology, the concept of sensitization was first adopted for mesoporous oxide layers with electron accepting properties that require the collection of photogenerated electrons from a perovskite light harvester. In 2012, Lee and co-workers realized that employing a mesoporous metal oxide as an ETL is not essential in PSCs when they found that devices made of a MAPbI3−xClx mixed perovskite coated on mesoporous Al2O3, which are unable to transport electrons from the perovskite absorber due to inappropriate energy band alignment, still managed to yield an efficiency of 10.9%. This observation showed that a perovskite absorber has the characteristic of long charge carrier diffusion length to act as a charge transporting material. Hence, simple planar structure is adequate to fabricate a solar cell using perovskite materials as the light absorber, which was then confirmed by several groups.

A compact ETL is typically used in a planar heterojunction PSC, where a perovskite light harvester is sandwiched between the compact ETL and HTM. In order to construct a compact ETL, materials based nanoparticles with distinguished electron transporting property are usually deposited on top of the TCO substrate. The compact ETL can be deposited through either low or high temperature processes subject to the type of TCO used. A FTO substrate is usually employed for the latter because the sheet resistivity of the ITO substrate was found to be seriously damaged by heating at temperatures of more than 400 °C. Due to the facile structure of the ETL, various fabrication methods have been adopted to deposit the compact ETL on the substrates, including spin coating, spray pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition, and chemical bath deposition. Although all the deposition methods employed are able to construct similar compact ETL structure, the resultant ETL appears in different morphologies with variation of the surface roughness, film thickness, and crystallinity, which in turn varies the photovoltaic properties of the fabricated PSCs.
The main roles of the compact ETL in a planar heterojunction PSC are to ensure an ease of transition of the photoexcited electrons from the perovskite active layer to the external circuit and to act as a hole blocking layer (HBL) to suppress the transportation of the photogenerated holes from the perovskite light-harvester to the FTO substrate. This also indicates that the compact ETL is able to hinder the reverse movement of the electrons from the FTO substrate to the perovskite layer (Fig. 2a). Therefore, it is essential for the ETL to have continuous, uniform, and ultrathin structure. This is important to ensure high light transmittance, as well as to keep the HTM or perovskite light absorber from having direct contact with the TCO substrate, to prevent serious electron–hole recombination that subsequently affects the device performances.
Currently, one of the main issues that needs to be solved in planar heterojunction devices is the hysteresis behaviour in power generation that accompanies the I–V performances of the PSCs. The PCE reported along with current hysteresis might be questionable and may possibly not represent the accurate device performance. Apart from an unbalanced electron/hole transport rate and defects in the interface, the device architecture is found to be one of the major factors that influence the hysteresis behaviour. The introduction of a compact ETL in between the perovskite absorber and FTO substrate has the capability of reducing the hysteresis effect (Fig. 2b and c) where this behaviour is related to trapping and detrapping mechanism of the electrons at the perovskite/ETL interfaces. It is important to note that the hysteresis effect in a regular planar heterojunction structure is greater than that of PSCs with a mesoporous ETL. Another crucial issue in PSCs is the long-term stability of the perovskite materials, which is affected by several factors including exposure to UV light and moisture. Therefore, the alternative solution to overcome the effect of the first factor is by employing ETLs that are insensitive to UV radiation. Meanwhile, the influence of the second factor can be minimized by the insertion of a mesoporous ETL.

A mesoporous structured PSC refers to a photovoltaic device that consists of voids within the ETL layer that allow the infiltration of perovskite materials. In PSCs, the materials used in the mesoporous ETL configuration have two main roles; to receive the photoexcited electrons from the perovskite absorber and subsequently transport the collected charges to the FTO substrate and to function as scaffolds to support the formation of a perovskite absorber. The advantage of employing a mesoporous ETL structure is it can provide larger contact between the electron transport material and perovskite active layer, which later enables faster charge transfer kinetics. This structure also improves the charge mobility and reduces the bulk defects and impurities in the device. This design is also useful for extracting photogenerated electrons and holes because the relatively short diffusion length of charge carriers within the perovskite materials in the planar heterojunction architecture (LeD = ca. 130 nm and LhD = ca. 90 nm for MAPbI3) may cause undesired displacement of the excitons over long distances. Moreover, the electron diffusion length of the MAPbI3 perovskite can be extended up to more than 1 μm in the presence of a mesoporous TiO2 structure. Mesoporous structures, either in the form of nanoparticles, nanorods, or other types of nanostructure, have been found to assist the PSC devices in retaining their stability for a longer time compared to those of planar heterojunction-based devices. The major causes of the difference in stability are basically attributed to the morphology, porosity, and chemical stability of the ETL used.

In comparison to planar heterojunction devices, a mesoporous ETL in PSCs can substantially facilitate the growth and nucleation of the perovskite materials for enabling a thicker absorber layer to be formed. In other words, the mesoporous ETL provides spaces for the penetration of perovskite precursors and confines the perovskite crystallites in the small volume of nanopores. This will enhance the absorption of incident photons and subsequently boost the photocurrent generation and increase device efficiency. Moreover, the presence of a mesoporous ETL helps to prevent the formation of pinholes in the compact HBL to hinder internal device shunting. The morphology of the perovskite crystal formed within the mesoporous framework also differs from the nanocrystals formed in planar heterojunction devices, leading to different device performance.
A mesoporous ETL in PSCs can be selected from ETL materials that have a lower CBM than the perovskite absorbers, such as TiO2, ZnO or SnO2; or non-ETL materials with a higher CBM than the perovskite materials, for example Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2. In the construction of a mesoporous PSC, a compact ETL, sometimes denoted as HBL, is typically required underneath the framework of the mesoporous structure to avoid direct contact between the perovskite absorber and TCO substrate. The absence of the blocking layer will result in higher electron–hole back recombination and thus reduces the VOC and FF of the device. The presence of a HBL either in mesoporous or regular planar configuration is essential to obtain a stabilized PCE close to the value determined from the I–V measurements. Zhang et al. reported that the mesoporous structured PSCs with HBL yield a stabilised PCE up to 13.5%, while the HBL-free counterpart exhibited stabilised PCE of only 2.7%.
For effective charge collection, it is also important to ensure that all nanopores within the scaffold framework are completely filled with perovskite materials. The existence of voids or dead volumes within the mesoporous structure will reduce the amount of photoactive perovskite material loading and thus minimizes the amount of light absorption. This will also increase the series resistance in the devices as a result of the increased electron/hole path length and recombination rate at the exposed surfaces of the ETL/perovskite interfaces, which eventually reduces the FF value. In addition, the voids that are filled with HTM, which have direct contact with mesoporous ETL, could result in low shunt resistance. Moreover, the empty regions within mesoporous PSCs that are filled with air will eventually degrade the perovskite absorber due to the reaction of the perovskite materials with free oxygen in the air.
A few groups have conducted tests to gain deeper insight on the importance of the mesoporous ETL structure towards the hysteresis effect of PSCs. Kim and co-workers observed that the hysteresis effect that occurred typically in the planar configuration of PSCs can be greatly minimized by using the mesoporous scaffold structure. One of the reasons lies in the fact that the low-frequency capacitance is reduced, meaning that the polarization that exists in the perovskite layer is released effectively because of enhanced electron injection as well as charge separation. Zhang et al. noticed that mesoporous PSCs with a compact HBL between the FTO and mesoporous scaffold displayed a reducing effect on the hysteresis behaviour compared to the mesoporous devices without any compact HBL. However, a compact planar architecture of PSC still exhibits an obvious hysteresis effect in comparison to mesoporous PSC. Chen and co-workers found that the hysteresis behaviour is greater if the scaffold is made from non-ETLs, such as Al2O3, as compared to materials with good electron transport properties like TiO2. Since the mesoporous Al2O3 and planar structures have a similar process of charge carrier transporting, where the photoexcited electrons diffuse along through the perovskite absorber before reaching the ETL, the array of dipoles in the perovskite absorber is strongly affected by the electron movement. The severity of the hysteresis behaviour in the PSC devices due to the influence of the ETL is represented in Fig. 3a.
Several studies have proven that the mesoporous structure could help PSC devices to retain their efficiency for longer periods in comparison to a planar heterojunction architecture. Although, a planar heterojunction PSC may show higher initial PCE, but the performance dropped significantly in a short duration. A similar phenomenon was observed in a very thin mesoporous film since this layer has great resemblance to the planar structure.Fig. 3b and c indicate the initial PCE values of the PSC devices and the normalized light absorbance of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite with respect to the thickness of the scaffold, respectively. The higher initial PCE values are attributed to the formation of a more uniform film and bigger perovskite crystal domains, which facilitate better electron transport property.
Meanwhile, the application of a thick mesoporous ETL minimized the perovskite crystal domains, created some surface defects, reduced the charge transport properties and decreased the initial PCE. When the cells were exposed to air, the perovskite layer underwent degradation as a result of the reaction with moisture in the air. Besides that, Li-doped spiro-OMeTAD that is usually used as a HTM in PSCs is found to be hygroscopic in nature. The direct contact of the perovskite layer with HTM will result in interaction between the perovskites and water molecules, which accelerates the degradation of the perovskite. However, the labyrinthine network of the mesoporous structure slows down the diffusion of water penetrating inside the scaffold and reduces the degradation rate of the perovskite materials. Other than that, the PbI2 grains formed during the decomposition of the perovskite structures created a “dead zone” as it hindered the movement of the photogenerated charges and forced the excitons to undergo charge recombination (Fig. 3d). The existence of a mesoporous ETL provided a pathway for the trapped electrons and retained the high performance of the device.

TiO2 is a well-known inorganic material that is used as an ETL in PSCs. It has an electron mobility of approximately 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 58) with a CBM of −4.2 eV vs. vacuum level. The CBM of TiO2 is relatively 0.3 eV lower than that of the MAPbI3 perovskite to facilitate the injection of photogenerated electrons from a perovskite light absorber to ETL. Moreover, the VBM of TiO2 is also much lower compared to perovskite materials, leading to efficient hole-blocking ability. Nowadays, there are vast numbers of matured fabrication technologies to fabricate a good compact or mesoporous TiO2 layer with desired morphology. However, TiO2 has good electrical conductivity merely after it is turned into nanocrystallites. Thus, TiO2 requires a high temperature process (ca. 500 °C) for nanocrystallite formation where the TiO2 compact layer is usually constructed on FTO substrate, which can withstand high temperatures of up to 700 °C.

TiO2 has several phases where the anatase and rutile phases have more research significance. In general, both TiO2 phases have a tetragonal unit cell and their crystal structures are built of TiO6 octahedra. Both the anatase and rutile TiO2 phases have wide band gaps of about 3.20 eV and 3.03 eV, respectively. The rutile TiO2 has a higher degree of crystal alignment as each crystal unit shares only two edges in comparison to that of anatase TiO2, which shares four edges as represented in Fig. 4a.
In the planar PSC configuration, Yella et al. obtained a PCE of 13.7% for the rutile-based device, which is observed to be nearly fourfold higher than that of the anatase-based counterpart, owing to its outstanding VOC of 1.11 V. Nonetheless, those devices showed strong hysteresis behaviour. The rutile-based mesoporous PSC as developed by Lee et al. also exhibited better device performance with a maximum PCE of 14.5% despite obtaining a slightly lower VOC. This effect can be ascribed to the impressive electron extraction from the perovskite to rutile TiO2 where the rutile(001) surface has better atoms and lattice arrangement that is compatible with a MAPbI3 perovskite (Fig. 4b). Besides, the bond lengths in a rutile TiO2–perovskite system are found to be shorter than that in an anatase TiO2–perovskite system, indicating a stronger surface interaction and easier charge transfer. Although each TiO2 phase has unique properties, their application in PSCs is less studied to date. Hence, further exploration in this area is needed in order to profoundly understand the interplay between the TiO2 phases and photovoltaic properties of the PSC devices.

A compact TiO2 layer is an essential layer in both planar and mesoporous PSCs to ensure highly efficient electron extraction and transport from the perovskite absorber to TCO. The morphology of compact TiO2 depends on the fabrication methods, which determine the thickness and roughness of the compact layer. Since the FTO substrate has rough surfaces of about 30 nm RMS (root mean square), the deposition of an ideal thin layer with uniform thickness without pinholes is difficult to achieve. Therefore, the selection of the fabrication methods is important to construct a compact layer with sufficient thickness to avoid the formation of any pinholes on the film. Nevertheless, the thickness and roughness of the ETL will in turn influence the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs.


According to most reports that have conducted comprehensive studies on compact TiO2 as an ETL with different thicknesses, in general, the perovskite cells displaying an increment of device performance as the compact ETL gets thicker up to a certain optimum thickness and this is then followed by a performance drop.Table 1 summarizes the effect of the thickness of the compact TiO2 layer on the device performances of PSCs. The optimum thickness of the ETL varies based on the fabrication methods adopted.

For example, utilizing vapour-phase deposition techniques, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), yielded a thin compact TiO2 of 10 nm to achieve high performance PSCs. On the other hand, solution-based deposition techniques, like spin coating, needed at least 65 nm thickness of compact TiO2 for achieving high performance devices. This is due to the fact that a thinner ETL increases the risk of pinhole formation, which subsequently offers direct contact between the perovskite layer and FTO substrate. This later deteriorates the JSC and FF values owing to the poor hole blocking ability or high current leakage at the ETL/perovskite interfaces.
Meanwhile, the increment of the ETL thickness results in an increase of the series resistance and electron hole recombination that consequently minimizes the JSC and FF of the devices. The effect of the ETL thickness on electron extraction and transport is illustrated in Fig. 5. A thick layer of ETL is reported to reduce the light transmittance due to stronger light scattering and greater absorption of photons with energy higher than that of the band gap of ETL. As a result, a low amount of photons enter the perovskite layer and subsequently reduces the photon absorption by the active layer. This also explains that a low amount of current will be generated as the photon absorption by the ETL does not much contribute to the photocurrent.

Nowadays, spin coating is the most common technique in the fabrication of the TiO2 compact layer due to its facile and matured application. Wu et al. synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles through a sol–gel method and spin coated the sol–gel onto FTO substrates to fabricate PSC devices and obtained a PCE of 8.4%. Nonetheless, this conventional technique has several drawbacks. For instance, the ETL fabricated through this technique usually has a low-quality film and the layer thickness is hard to control. In addition, the spin coating method is not appropriate for large-scale production of the PSC for commercialization. Even though spin coating can produce a very smooth top layer as represented in Fig. 6a, the ETL thickness is inconsistent throughout the whole deposited area due to the rough surface of FTO substrate, as well as the diffusibility and surface tension of the liquid precursor. This increases the electron–hole recombination as described in the previous section (Fig. 5). The effect of changing the type of precursor (titanium isopropoxide or TiCl4) and solvent (ethanol or isopropanol) for spin coating was also studied, but the devices still exhibited insignificant changes of the efficiency. Thus, other fabrication techniques have been explored to overcome this issue.

Generally, any deposition techniques that enable the fabrication of a pinhole-free and very thin ETL will greatly contribute to the enhancement of the JSC of PSC devices, which in turn improves the device efficiency. These include liquid-based methods like electrophoretic deposition (EPD), vapour-based methods such as ALD, and other modified techniques like thermal oxidation. The main reasons lie in the thickness and homogeneity of the compact ETL, which influence the series resistance and JSC value. In planar PSC, Lu and co-workers claimed that PSCs based on a TiO2 compact layer, which were prepared via ALD technique, exhibited a PCE about 56% higher than that of a device based on a spin coated TiO2 compact layer. Wu et al. also observed a PCE enhancement for their ALD-constructed TiO2 device in relation to the spray pyrolysis-prepared or spin coating-based counterparts. As can be seen in Fig. 6c, the ALD method yielded a rougher surface of compact TiO2 following the surface of the FTO substrate. However, it was able to produce a pinhole-free layer as thin as 10 nm, which has the advantage of low charge transport resistance.
In comparison to the ALD technique, a spin coating method created a high density of pinhole defects followed by spray pyrolysis (Fig. 6b), which affected the charge recombination rate within the devices. In the meantime, the potentiostatic anodization and radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) methods have also been proven to be effective ways to deposit a compact TiO2 layer, where both devices showed less hysteresis behaviour and achieved device efficiencies of up to 15.2% and 12.1%, respectively (Fig. 6d and e).
In the mesoporous PSC configuration, the deposition technique used for a compact HBL is also crucial. The fabrication of a compact HBL can be simplified through a low cost dip-coating method where a maximum PCE of 12.8% was achieved (Fig. 6f). Su and his team reported that the PCE was enhanced by 31% from 10.4% when the electro-deposition method was adopted to fabricate HBL, in contrast to the employment of spin coated HBL, owing to better coating and the very thin layer (about 29 nm) of the electro-deposited HBL (Fig. 6g). A compact layer of 15 nm thickness of the TiO2 nanosheets was also prepared by the electro-deposition method to substitute conventional TiO2 nanoparticles where both the PSC devices showed comparable PCE values of 10.7% and 10.5%, respectively. However, the unique morphology of the TiO2 nanosheets had contributed to the reduction of the hysteresis effect (Fig. 6h).
Moreover, the simultaneous deposition of TiO2 as a HBL and mesoporous layer can be done through a thermal oxidation process. In brief, a Ti film was coated on the FTO substrate using the initial RFMS method followed by a spin coated TiO2 porous layer on top of this film before both layers were annealed together at high temperature, converting the Ti film to a TiO2 compact layer. The thickness of the compact HBL was controlled within 15 nm thickness with aims to obtain a maximum PCE of up to 15.1%.
Since each material employed has its own strengths and weaknesses, the introduction of double-layered compact ETLs based on TiO2 and ZnO are found to improve the PCE of the planar heterojunction PSC by 30.3%. This could be because TiO2 possessed low interfacial recombination but with slightly lower charge extraction properties, while ZnO demonstrated higher recombination rate with faster charge injection at the interfaces. The combination of these materials compensated each other shortages, which later improved the transportation of the photogenerated electrons and prevented charge accumulation to suppress surface recombination within the devices (Fig. 7a).
However, in constructing the double compact ETL layers, the selection and configuration of the inorganic materials according to their energy levels, such as tuning the compatible CBM and VBM levels, are crucial to ensure the high performance of the PSC. As illustrated in Fig. 7b, the incorporation of TiO2 between the SnO2 and FTO layers effectively blocked electron transport from the perovskite layer and increased the carrier recombination due to charge attraction, which subsequently plummeted the PCE to 2.2%.Table 2 summarizes the dependence of the device performance on the fabrication method and the corresponding optimum thickness of the compact ETL.

A mesoporous TiO2 based ETL (mp-TiO2) is one of the most common and effective structures in the device configuration of PSCs. Currently, there are various types of mesoporous structure that have been developed by researchers for application in PSCs. In general, mesoporous TiO2 can be categorized into four groups of nanostructure, according to their dimension, namely: zero-dimensional (0D) mp-TiO2, which represents nanoparticles; one-dimensional (1D) mp-TiO2, which includes nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, nanohelices, and nanocones; two-dimensional (2D) mp-TiO2 like nanosheets; three-dimensional (3D) mp-TiO2, such as 3D nanorods, 3D nanowires, and nanofibers. Fig. 8 displays the diverse nanostructures of mp-TiO2 used in PSCs. The morphological parameters of the mesoporous layer, for instance the particle sizes, rod diameters, and layer thicknesses, are tuneable and have effects on the device performances, which will be discussed in detail as below.


Nowadays, TiO2 nanoparticles as scaffolds are widely used nanostructures in mesoporous perovskite solar cells (mp-PSCs). However, nanoparticle-based TiO2 suffered from difficulty for perovskite filling into the nanopores of the framework because of their labyrinthine networks. Moreover, this mesoporous structure exhibited relatively slower electron transporting properties as compared to other types of TiO2 nanostructures, owing to the existence of grain boundaries that caused higher charge recombination. Therefore, tuning the size and shape of the TiO2 nanoparticles as well as the thickness and design of the mesoporous layer are crucial steps in developing highly efficient PSCs.

Electron injection at the TiO2/perovskite interface and electron transporting through the TiO2 nanoparticles depend on the particle size and shape of the mp-TiO2 due to the effects of pore size, porosity, and effective contact area. To investigate the effect of particle size towards the efficiency of the PSCs, several research groups fabricated mesoporous PSCs using TiO2 nanoparticles with different sizes. Basically, larger particle size of mp-TiO2 is advantageous for the penetration of more perovskite precursors where these larger TiO2 nanoparticles yield bigger pore sizes, and thus provide broader and easier paths for perovskites to infiltrate into the bottom of the mp-ETL. This also improves and completes the contact areas between the perovskite nanocrystals and ETL, leading to higher JSC and FF values. The enhancement of the perovskite/TiO2 contact areas will subsequently increase the injection rate of photoexcited electrons from perovskite to mp-TiO2. Moreover, employing larger TiO2 nanoparticles will reduce the series resistance or electron transporting resistance within the film, owing to the minimized grain boundaries.
However, the porosity between the TiO2 nanoparticles before the deposition of the perovskite layer and the specific surface area (i.e. the surface of contact between TiO2 and the perovskite over the mass of TiO2 particles) are found to decrease with the enlargement of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Lower porosity reduces the availability of volume that can be filled by perovskite materials inside the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, which leads to low light harvesting ability and hence negatively affects the JSC of the solar cell. In addition, increasing the size of the mp-TiO2 nanoparticles will shorten the lifetime of the photoexcited electrons that attributed to the higher recombination rate (smaller Rrec), resulting in lower VOC and FF. Interestingly, the charge transfer resistance (RCT), due to the selective contact or interface, is unaffected by the size modification of the ETL nanoparticles. Therefore, in order to compromise the two contradicted prerequisites as discussed above, an optimum nanoparticle size is necessary.
Sarkar et al. found that mesoporous PSCs with 15 nm diameter TiO2 nanoparticles displayed 9% higher PCE than that of their 10 nm based TiO2 nanoparticle counterpart, indicating that the nanoparticle size of the mesoporous layer played an important role in determining the efficiency of the PSCs. Regarding the shapes of the mp-TiO2 nanoparticles, a spherical shape is preferable to yield uniform mesopores. Sung and co-workers successfully developed single-crystals formed of spherical mp-TiO2 nanoparticles by altering the solvent system in a conventional hydrothermal method and the fabricated devices yielded a PCE of 17.2% by utilizing 50 nm size mp-TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 9a). The tremendous improvement of PCE is attributed to the enhancement of the connectivity and contact between the spherical TiO2 nanoparticles, which create a homogeneous shape and size of the mesopores for better infiltration of the perovskite materials.
On top of that, the individual primary TiO2 nanoparticles can be interconnected tightly to form spherical TiO2 aggregates. The larger external pores of the spherical nanostructure framework facilitated more infiltration of the perovskite materials and the existence of internal pores led to a larger contacting area. Furthermore, the tight interconnection between the individual nanoparticles that made up the spherical nanostructure allowed efficient charge transport through the mp-TiO2 layer and improved light scattering.
By adopting this concept, Yang et al. observed a PCE improvement of up to 18.4% for PSCs that used spherical aggregates with a diameter of 100 nm (Fig. 9b). PSCs based on this nanostructure also displayed lower hysteresis behaviour and longer electron lifetime than PSCs using conventional TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes of 30 nm or 50 nm. Bigger aggregates with 250 nm diameter TiO2 nanoparticles have also been produced by Huang et al., but the latter fabricated devices acquired a PCE of merely 15.0%. Table 3 summarizes the dependence of the device performances on the size of the mp-TiO2 nanoparticles employed as ETLs in PSCs.

In a short summary, the device performance of the PSC, particularly the FF and PCE, is found to increase with enlargement of the single TiO2 nanoparticles up to a diameter of 50 nm and this was then followed by performance dropped. The device efficiency could be further enhanced through the formation of spherical aggregates from individual primary nanoparticles where its optimal size requires further investigation.

The thickness of the TiO2 nanoparticle layer also strongly influences the pore filling and light harvesting properties of the perovskite material and electron collection at the perovskite/mp-TiO2 interfaces. In general, the fabrication of TiO2-based mesoporous PSCs with the same overall device thickness but a different combination of the mp-ETL and perovskite overlayer (thicker mp-ETL and thinner perovskite overlayer or vice versa), resulted in similar reflectance spectra for all the devices. However, different device performances were recorded as the thickness of the perovskite and mesoporous layers changed. Only the interlayer that consisted of a compact structure or too thick perovskite overlayer with a very thin layer of mp-ETL caused severe charge recombination. This is due to the fact that the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in this type of device has low ability to transport and dissociate at the perovskite/HBL interfaces.

For mesoporous PSCs with a much thicker TiO2 nanoparticle layer, the fabricated device will have a larger perovskite/mp-ETL interface area for better electron injection from the perovskite to TiO2. The thicker mesoporous layer allows greater loading of the perovskite materials, resulting in higher light absorption and improvement of the JSC. The hysteresis behaviour also becomes less apparent as the mesoporous thickness increases due to a decline in the low-frequency capacitance. Nevertheless, the thicker mesoporous structure not only increases the series resistance and dark current of the PSCs due to the longer electron path length, but this structure also simultaneously creates longer routes for holes to move from the region of exciton generation to the HTM, which consequently raises the chance of electron and hole recombination. Hence, this parameter must be optimized to obtain the best device performance.
In the early stages of mesoporous PSC development, perovskite sensitized mesoporous solar cells that employed a 600 nm thick mp-TiO2 layer delivered a PCE of more than 9%. By adopting a screen printing method and employing PTAA as the HTM, Heo and colleagues fabricated PSCs with a similar thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer and obtained 12.0% efficiency. With fabrication technology getting more advanced, a thin mp-TiO2 layer was successfully deposited through spin coating a precursor solution that has been modified with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), where the best device consisted of a 220 nm thick mp-TiO2 layer and exhibited a PCE of up to 14.6%. The same thickness of a mp-TiO2 layer has also been acknowledged to show relatively low hysteresis behaviour with a merely 0.059 hysteresis index.
In addition to the aforementioned effects, several groups discovered that the optimum thickness for the highest efficiency perovskite cells is varied from the optimum thickness for most stable devices. Yin and his team found that PSCs with 160 nm thickness of the mp-TiO2 nanoparticles showed the highest PCE of 11.1% initially, but this then declined to less than 7% after 100 days of exposure to ambient air. In contrast, the initial PCE of the average devices based on 240 nm thickness of the mp-TiO2 nanoparticles achieved 10.2% and then dropped to 8.6% after it underwent the same ageing condition. Since the thin mesoporous film has greater resemblance to a planar heterojunction device, it also displayed poorer resistance against moisture attack, as explained in an earlier section of this review.

To acquire a complete fill of the perovskite materials in the mesoporous ETL structure, especially for devices based on TiO2 nanoparticles, is technically challenging where it is limited by the small domain size of the mesopores. Therefore, Zheng et al. modified the mesoporous structure by constructing PSCs with a dual-porous ETL based on TiO2 (Fig. 9c). In this structure fabrication, a solution of polystyrene with diameter spheres of 220 nm and TiO2 were spin coated on top of the compact TiO2/FTO substrates. This is followed by drying and heating the deposited solution to evaporate the polystyrene spheres, creating macroporous sphere-like voids and mesopores throughout the film. By optimizing the compact HBL, the best device achieved a PCE of 9.8%. Through further modification of the fabrication method, the same group fabricated TiO2 nanobowl based devices (Fig. 9d), which achieved a maximum PCE of 12.0%. The polystyrene-assisted method was also adopted by Chen et al. to prepare an inverse-opal like TiO2 nanostructure (Fig. 9e), which appeared in an identical dual-porous structure but with slight variation in the pore sizes, due to the different diameter of polystyrene used. The latter fabricated PSCs obtained a device efficiency of 13.1%.

All of these nanostructure frameworks accommodated the loads of highly crystalline perovskite materials, which improved the interface contact for efficient charge extraction and charge transport. Furthermore, these unique structures also showed higher light transmission for certain wavelengths than bare FTO, owing to the enhancement of the light scattering effect, which increases the light harvesting activity of the perovskite absorbers. In contrast to conventional porous ETL devices, the dual-porous structure also exhibited much lower series resistance.

As mentioned above, the mesoporous layer that utilized nanoparticles might have problems with perovskite loading due to their labyrinthine form and the existence of grain boundaries that disrupted the electron transport pathways within mp-TiO2 nanoparticles. Hence, various one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanocones, as ETLs in PSCs have been introduced to overcome this issue.


For application in PSCs, TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 10a) were typically grown directly on FTO or on a compact TiO2 layer through a hydrothermal process, which created a vertical structure of the TiO2 nanorods. Several groups claimed that vertical nanorods exhibited electron mobility two orders of magnitude higher than the nanoparticle-based ETL. The employment of vertical nanorods contributed to the enhancement of the JSC in PSC devices. This could be attributed to four factors, i.e., (i) vertical nanorods with more open porous structure improved the percolation paths of the perovskite materials, which facilitated perovskite infiltration into the mesoporous layer and increased exciton generation, (ii) the one-dimensional morphology of the nanorods offered a directive path for electron transport to the TCO substrate and minimized the charge transport resistance in the nanorods, (iii) the larger size of the nanorods improved the light scattering and absorption properties of the PSCs, and (iv) the presence of a nanorod array enlarged the perovskite/TiO2 interface area for better exciton dissociation, enhancement of the charge collection properties, and retardation of the charge recombination at the perovskite/TiO2 interfaces.

In the early stage of PSC development, a PCE of more than 9% has been achieved through the fabrication of a perovskite-sensitized TiO2 nanorod solar cell. Fakharuddin et al. showed that a TiO2 nanorod-based PSC had better PCE and stability than that of the planar or nanoparticle-based PSC counterparts. The improvement of the PCE was attributed to the substantial increment of the JSC in nanorod-based devices. In terms of the stability, nanorod-based devices exhibited irregular behaviour where the JSC and PCE of the devices increased after several hours of exposure to light, in spite of the well-known unstable nature of perovskite materials. This is attributed to the better thermodynamic stability of the rutile TiO2 nanorods compared to the anatase TiO2 compact layer and mesoscopic nanoparticles, which subsequently improved the chemical stability at the TiO2/perovskite interfaces; or due to the single crystallinity and greater porous volume of the nanorod framework that led to thermodynamic equilibrium.

Due to being identical to a typical TiO2 nanoparticle based-ETL, mesoporous structure based-TiO2 nanorods are not an ideal structure for mp-PSCs because this nanostructure relies strongly on the deposition method of the perovskite materials and length of the nanorods. In the early development of the TiO2 nanorod-based PSCs, when the perovskite layer was deposited via one-step spin coating, Kim et al. observed that the photovoltaic properties were better with shorter electron transport nanorods (where 0.56 μm nanorods gave a PCE of 9.4%). This was because shorter TiO2 nanorods formed homogenous and vertically well aligned configuration, while longer nanorods decreased the degree of order and alignment. Thus, longer nanorods had poor pore filling factor, causing a reduction of the JSC, VOC and PCE values.

However, better pore filling of the perovskite materials into the TiO2 nanorod scaffold was observed when a two-step deposition technique was employed. This result completely changed the early perception on the effect of the nanorod length on the device performances. As the amount of dead volume in the nanorod film was no longer affected by the nanorod length, thus longer nanorods enabled thicker deposition of the perovskite layer that subsequently increased the JSC, owing to an improvement of the light absorption properties. Son et al. proved that 1 μm long TiO2 nanorod film resulted in a PCE of 10.0%, which was found to be better than the previous results reported by Kim and colleagues. On the other hand, the charge recombination rate and series resistance are observed to increase with nanorod length, which led to a decrement of the device performances. Hence, an optimum length of nanorod is required to obtain high performance devices. The main concern when constructing a nanorod-based PSC is that the tip of the nanorod must not be in direct contact with the HTM layer as it can deteriorates the FF value due to charge recombination. The most effective way to avoid such phenomenon is through the employment of a perovskite capping layer by increasing the concentration of the perovskite precursor.

The diameter, density, and orientation of the TiO2 nanorods can tailor the porosity of the scaffold and subsequently affect the ability of penetration, amount of perovskite formation and contacting surface area. Tailoring these parameters is crucial in determining the performance of the PSCs. Previously, increasing the nanorod length by prolonging the growth time during the hydrothermal reaction simultaneously enlarged the diameter of the TiO2 nanorod. However, the surface area of the nanorods was observed to not be directly proportional to its length. Recently, Cai et al. explained that the diameter, length, and density of the nanorods could be controlled independently through some modification of the parameters during hydrothermal reaction, such as the growth time of the nanorods as well as the concentration of glycerol, titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide, and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate dehydrate (Na2EDTA). Their PSC devices fabricated with 0.7 μm and 1.1 μm long TiO2 nanorods exhibited a comparable PCE of more than 11%.

The type of solvents used may also affect the formation of the TiO2 nanorods. In comparison to the ethanol–HCl solution, the utilization of water–HCl solution grows a well aligned and more homogeneous TiO2 nanorod array, which eventually led to PCE improvement of 3.3%. Li et al. explained that the JSC and FF of the TiO2 nanorod-based PSC could be optimized by employing a nanorod array with void-space-fraction of 0.682, which corresponded to a nanorod density of 606 rods per μm2 and average diameter of 22.9 nm. An impressive efficiency of 18.2% was acquired, which is the highest PCE reported so far for 1D TiO2 nanostructure-based PSCs. A non-vertical TiO2 nanorod array has also been developed for PSCs. Instead of growing well aligned TiO2 nanorods directly on the FTO substrate, Li et al. synthesized the nanorods separately to acquire a TiO2 nanorod powder. The powder underwent ligand exchange treatment before it was mixed with PbI2 precursor solution for further fabrication of a bulk intermixing-typed PSC (highest PCE = 12.9%). This type of device architecture also enabled the deposition of an mp-TiO2 scaffold layer on any substrate through a low temperature process.

The PSCs based on TiO2 nanowires and TiO2 nanorods have several resemblances in the aspects of perovskite material infiltration and the electron transporting properties, but the structure of the nanowire differs from the nanorod in terms of the ratio between the length and diameter. A typical nanorod has shorter length between the tens to hundreds of nanometres and relatively thicker diameter as compared to its length. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 10b, nanowires may has much greater length in the range of hundreds of nanometres to microns or they sometimes reach millimetres, whereas the diameter of the nanowire is insignificant to its length. Until now, the application of the TiO2 nanowire in PSC devices is very scarce. In the early stage of TiO2 nanowire based-PSCs, perovskite sensitized solar cells based on ca. 1.5 μm long TiO2 nanowire arrays without any HBL attained a device efficiency of up to 4.9%. Later, Jiang and his team fabricated PSCs that employed 900 nm long TiO2-nanowire and obtained a PCE of 11.7%.

TiO2 nanowire-based PSCs displayed similar behaviour to TiO2 nanorod based devices where the JSC and PCE values are improved as the TiO2 nanowire length was elongated up to a certain optimum value followed by a performance drop. The elongation of the nanowire length represented an increment of the mesoporous thickness, which in turn allowed greater perovskite formation and increased photon absorption. Again, as the nanowire thickness reached the optimum, further elongation of the nanowire resulted in greater series resistance, owing to the enlargement of the charge carrier transport distance that subsequently lowered the JSC. In this case, the charge recombination rate also rose because of the limitation of the diffusion length of the photogenerated holes in the perovskite, which deteriorated the VOC.
Moreover, there are two other parameters that can influence the device performance in relation to the thickness of the scaffold, which are the density and diameter of the TiO2 nanowires. The low density of the TiO2 nanowire created broader opening of the voids between the nanowires and thus enabled more infiltration of the perovskite materials and formed a mesoporous layer with minimized dead volumes. Meanwhile, a large diameter of TiO2 nanowire reduced the contact area between the nanowire/perovskite interfaces and consequently minimized the PSC performance.

In contrast to the conventional TiO2 nanoparticle based-ETL, TiO2 nanotube based-devices exhibited not only substantially larger light absorption over the whole spectrum, due to the improved light trapping properties, but also possessed large surface-to volume ratio, which increased electron extraction. Nevertheless, the fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes is more complicated than TiO2 nanoparticles or nanorods and hence, nanotube-based PSCs are rarely studied. As a consequence, little information is available about the impact of the morphological parameters of the nanotubes, such as the length, diameter, thickness and density, on the performance of the PSC. At this point, it is known that the increment of the nanotube length enabled larger perovskite loading, but the charge recombination rate also increased with length, which negatively affected the VOC and JSC of the device.

Zhang and co-workers fabricated PSCs with 1.1 μm long TiO2 nanotube arrays using ZnO nanowires as templates and treated them with ammonium hexafluorotitanate, (NH4)2TiF6 (Fig. 10c). The devices showed reduction of the hysteresis index and obtained a device efficiency of 9.3%. On the other hand, Gao et al. fabricated PSCs with freestanding TiO2 nanotubes via two-step electrochemical anodization, but due to restriction of this synthesis method, their best performing devices with a PCE of 6.5% consisted of 2.3 μm long tubes, which were the shortest nanotubes produced during the study. Besides, the TiO2 nanotube arrays caused variations in the deposition of the perovskite and HTL. Hence, Gao et al. improvised their fabrication technique by splitting the bundled nanotube arrays into separated nanotubes and achieved a PCE of 13.8% which is the highest PCE for TiO2 nanotube-based PSCs to date.
TiO2 nanotube arrays as an ETL can also be deposited on flexible substrates, as reported by Wang and colleagues,via an electrochemical anodization technique. A PSC based on TiO2 nanotube arrays ca. 300 nm long and 60 nm thick obtained a PCE of 8.3%. Here, it is worth mentioning that Salazar et al. obtained a device efficiency of 5.0% for PSCs employing 0.4 μm long TiO2 nanotubes as an ETL. The much lower PCE gained for shorter TiO2 nanotubes is likely due to the adoption of one-step solution coating of the perovskite layer that results in poor infiltration of the perovskite materials, where an identical phenomena occurred in the TiO2 nanorod-based PSCs.

In the efforts to improve the performance and stability of the PSC devices, other nanostructures of ETL also have been developed. As shown in Fig. 10d, Lee et al. successfully fabricated PSCs based on mesoporous TiO2 nanohelices with different pitchs and radii through an oblique-angle electron beam evaporation technique where their best devices demonstrated a PCE of 12.1%. The TiO2 nanohelices possessed greater electron transporting properties due to the larger grain size and their device did not exhibit any hysteresis behaviour due to the immediate dissipation of the capacitive charges.

Meanwhile, Zhong et al. and Peng et al. synthesized TiO2 nanocones as an ETL (Fig. 10e) and recorded a PCE enhancement of 18% and 36% in relation to their TiO2-nanorod based-devices. It was found that the TiO2 nanocones had larger surface-to-volume-ratio, which allowed a greater amount of perovskite loading and thus, enhanced the light harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, the gradually shrunken TiO2 nanocone structure helps the formation of bottom fusion, which prevents direct contact between the perovskite and FTO substrate, especially for HBL-free TiO2 nanocone-based PSCs. The electron transfer rate in the TiO2 nanocones was found to be 2–3 times faster than TiO2 nanorods. The electrostatic potential in the TiO2 nanocone varied across the axial direction, creating an electric field along the Z axis, which helped to minimize electron trapping and improved the electron injection as well as transport ability of the TiO2 nanocone.

Two-dimensional (2D) TiO2 as an ETL is typically referred to as TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. 10f). Currently, research on the TiO2 nanosheet-based ETL is very scarce. Rong et al. showed that TiO2 nanosheet-based PSCs achieved a PCE of 10.6% which is 43% higher in relation to the TiO2 nanoparticle-based PSC counterpart. This is attributed to the higher recombination resistance and electron injection efficiency, owing to the greater concentration of the ionic charge of the exposed (001) facet of the TiO2 nanosheets as compared to the (101) facet of the TiO2 nanoparticles. This characteristic allows the TiO2 nanosheets to strengthen the adhesion of the perovskite absorber on the ETL surface and screen the electron injection from the CBM of the electron collector, and thus leads to higher charge injection efficiency and lower recombination, which in turn improved the JSC and VOC of the devices.


Recently, three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 as an ETL has become an interesting study in PSCs in order to create an ETL with much better optical, electrical, and morphological properties. 3D TiO2 nanostructures possess several merits over flat film or low dimensional-based TiO2 nanostructures. These nanostructures have (i) larger surface area for faster charge transfer, (ii) greater nucleation sites for perovskite formation, (iii) better electron transport ability, and (iv) increased optical pathways in the perovskite layer due to light scattering effect. These properties of the 3D TiO2 nanostructures lead to reduction of the charge recombination in the device, improvement of the light harvesting ability, and a boost in the JSC and efficiency of the PSC.

Up to now, several 3D TiO2 nanostructures have been employed in PSC devices. Jaramillo-Quintero et al. developed PSCs based on 3D hierarchical TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 11a) via two-step hydrothermal methods at low temperature. The device showed a PCE increment of about 40% and 5% compared to the planar heterojunction and 1D TiO2-based PSC, respectively. Meanwhile, devices fabricated by Dharani et al. using electrospun TiO2 fibres as the ETL (Fig. 11b) achieved a device efficiency of as high as 9.8%. However, since the development of a homogeneous layer thinner than 413 nm was limited by the processing method and diameter of the TiO2 nanofibers thus, the PCE enhancement for this device is very difficult. This is due to the fact that thick and large diameter TiO2 nanofibers prevented the complete infiltration of the perovskite materials and reduced light absorption.
Other than this, 3D TiO2 nanowires were successfully synthesized by means of a surface-reaction-limited pulsed chemical vapour deposition (SPCVD) technique and in situ hydrothermal method. The former technique was optimized to create 600 nm long nanowires with branched structure (Fig. 11c) whereas the latter technique formed a 3D network with a thickness of 300 nm (Fig. 11d). Both PSC devices demonstrated PCE values of 9.0% and 9.2%, respectively, which were comparable to the leading nanoparticle-based device of the time. Another 3D TiO2 nanostructure worth mentioning here is the TiO2 nanoflower, which had shown device efficiency of 15.7% (Fig. 11e). Interestingly, this type of nanostructure was simply developed through a low temperature processing route, which was a rarely observed phenomenon for a high performance PSC based on mesoporous-TiO2.

Each TiO2 nanostructure that has been described previously had its own advantages and drawbacks for being applied as an ETL in PSCs. Therefore, scientists and researchers have come out with a new idea to combine different TiO2 nanostructures into a single ETL in order to minimize the shortages of some of the TiO2 nanostructures while sustaining their strengths. This approach enlarges the total surface area, increases the available sites for perovskite formation, and magnifies the light scattering as well as absorption properties, which contributes to enhancement of the overall performance of the PSC device.

As shown in Fig. 11f, TiO2 nanorods that possessed large feature size were blended with TiO2 nanoparticles. The introduction of 10% TiO2 nanorods into the TiO2 nanoparticle scaffold improved the PCE from 11.9% to 15.2%. The TiO2 nanorods alleviated the labyrinthine connectivity, widened the pore volumes of the nanoparticles, resulting in greater perovskite infiltration, and improved the perovskite crystalline and network formation with fairly uniform morphology. A combination of TiO2 nanofibers and nanorods based on anatase TiO2, which is known as a 3D hyperbranched ETL, has been successfully developed by Mahmood and co-workers (Fig. 11g). The device efficiency grew by 29% in relation to the conventional TiO2 nanofiber-based counterpart. In addition to reasonably low hysteresis, less charge recombination is also observed as a result of reduced surface trap density and improved electron lifetime via the interconnecting networks of the hyperbranches. Table 4 compiles the device performances of the PSCs according to their TiO2 nanostructures as ETLs.

Employing TiO2 as an ETL in a PSC has several drawbacks. For instance, TiO2-based PSCs degrade rapidly when exposed to UV illumination. Leijtens et al. suggested using an UV filter to inhibit the UV light from reaching the TiO2 layer or stably pacifying the surface of the TiO2. Moreover, pristine TiO2 still has relatively low electron mobility. At the same time, TiO2 typically requires a high-temperature sintering of about 500 °C, which increases the energy pay-back time and restricts the production of solar cells on flexible substrates. Hence, scientists and researchers are looking for other types of inorganic material to substitute TiO2 as an ETL in PSCs, including metal oxides such as ZnO, SnO2, tungsten trioxide (WO3), indium(III) oxide (In2O3), etc., as well as metal sulfides like zinc sulfide (ZnS), cadmium sulfide (CdS), and indium sulphide (In2S3). Some of the materials, for instance Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2, which have non-electron transporting properties, are simply used as a scaffold as they have higher CBM than that of the perovskite materials.


ZnO has a band gap similar to TiO2 of 3.2 eV. Its CBM is relatively higher than TiO2, but still lower than that of a perovskite light absorber. Nevertheless, the electron mobility of ZnO, which is nearly 200 cm2 V−1 s−1, is found to be two orders of magnitude higher than that of TiO2. Therefore, a high efficiency of electron extraction and electron transport is expected for a ZnO based ETL in a PSC. Moreover, high crystallinity of ZnO could also be acquired without a sintering process, which can significantly reduce the production cost. The low temperature processability of ZnO enables this layer to be employed as an ETL in regular and inverted architectures of PSCs as well as on rigid or flexible substrates. Here, it is noteworthy to mention that PSCs based on a flexible substrate usually have lower device performances than rigid PSCs, mainly due to the properties of the substrate, such as low light transmittance and inherent sheet resistance, rather than the ETL itself.


As it is identical to compact TiO2, ZnO is employed to increase the shunt resistance (Rsh) and suppress charge recombination at the TCO surface. The optimization of the ZnO thickness layer is also important where a very thin layer of compact ZnO could cause higher recombination at the ZnO/perovskite interfaces, while a thicker film could result in larger series resistance and increase the recombination rate in the device. Liu et al. prepared a ZnO compact layer using a spin coating method without further sintering or calcination processes. Their best device, with a PCE of 15.7%, was achieved with a 25 nm thick ZnO layer as an ETL, which is thinner than the solution processed TiO2 compact layer (ca. 60 nm). However, the stability of this device is quite poor. This is because the surface of the unannealed ZnO layer possessed some chemisorbed oxygen species like hydroxide, which may cause degradation of the perovskite nanocrystals. This issue can be overcome by either annealing the ZnO layer beforehand or introducing a buffer layer in between the ZnO and perovskite active layer. In the meantime, Heo and co-workers employed spin coated nano-sol ZnO as an ETL, and the fabricated devices obtained maximum PCE values of 17.7% and 15.6% for the rigid and flexible PSCs, respectively. Their rigid devices had slightly better efficiency and less hysteresis effect than the TiO2-based counterparts (PCE 17.3%), which was ascribed to the longer charge carrier lifetime and higher electron conductivity.

Several techniques also have been applied to fabricate a ZnO compact layer. A PSC based on a ZnO compact layer prepared by ALD method demonstrated a PCE of 13.1%. The ALD technique forms a more condense layer in comparison to the solution processed method and hence, it will inhibit charge recombination effectively. On the other hand, the magnetron sputtering technique enables the fabrication of a compact ZnO layer based on a highly dense nanorod array. Since the c-axis oriented ZnO nanorods were perpendicular to the ITO substrate, electron transport was promoted, as indicated by the high JSC value of 22.4 mA cm−2. An intrinsic ZnO compact layer has also been developed through electrochemical deposition and sputtering methods where PCE values of 10.9% and 14.2% were recorded for the respective devices. Nevertheless, the PSC based on the former method displayed less hysteresis behaviour in comparison to the latter device as a result of the different morphological properties of the resultant ZnO compact layer.
As mentioned before, the long term stability and hysteresis effect of the ZnO-based PSCs could be improved by the inclusion of a passivation layer, such as PbI2, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and poly(ethyleneimine) PEI, between ZnO and the perovskite light absorber. The addition of a passivation layer helps to enhance the VOC, and subsequently the PCE, as it provides larger energy-level offset between the quasi-Fermi levels of the ETL and HTM. Moreover, trap-assisted charge recombination at the ZnO interface and in the bulk of the perovskite was substantially reduced. In order to effectively prevent direct contact between the perovskite absorber and ZnO layer, a more robust material, such as PEI, is favourable for the passivation layer compared to a less robust material like PCBM, which could undergo aggregation and diffusion during the annealing process.

The mesoporous ZnO layer is usually based on ZnO nanorods (Fig. 12a), which provide larger spaces for perovskite infiltration and a better light scattering effect. This structure could improve the light absorption ability of the perovskite absorber and subsequently improve the JSC value. However, ZnO nanorod-based PSCs suffered slightly lower VOC values than planar heterojunction devices as a consequence of increased charge recombination owing to the larger interfacial area. Kumar and colleagues obtained efficiencies of 8.9% and 2.6% for ZnO nanorod-based PSCs on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively.

Other than that, Son et al. explained that the diameter and length of the ZnO nanorods can be controlled through modifying the precursor concentration and immersion time during the growing process of the ZnO nanorods. They also observed that ZnO nanorod-based PSCs performed better than TiO2 nanorod-based devices with PCE differences of 1.1%, due to a faster charge collection rate in ZnO-based PSCs. A larger diameter of nanorod is beneficial for improving the light scattering effect in PSCs. The light scattering effect is an essential factor because it will lengthen the paths of the light in the perovskite absorber, leading to higher absorption probability and lower transmission. However, the electron transport properties may be negatively affected by the increasing diameter. The increment of the ZnO nanorod diameter will result in reduction of the perovskite/ETL interface areas and decrease in the interface defect density.
Other types of ZnO nanostructure have also been constructed to improve the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. Tang et al. synthesized ZnO nanowalls through a low temperature chemical bath method and obtained a device efficiency of 13.6% (Fig. 12b). The employment of the ZnO nanowalls encouraged electron transfer from the perovskite layer, which subsequently led to substantial increment in the FF. As shown in Fig. 12c and d, Mahmood and his team successfully deposited horizontal ZnO nanorods on top of the ZnO nanosheet arrays to create a double-layer of ZnO nanostructure based PSCs. The ZnO nanorods possessed high charge transport properties while the ZnO nanosheet arrays provided better penetration and contact with the perovskite nanocrystals. As a result, the PSCs employing ZnO nanorods with diameters of 800 nm as the ETLs had a certified PCE of 10.4%. The device performances of the PSCs that employed ZnO as the ETLs are summarized in Table 5.

ZnO is not the ideal material to substitute TiO2 as the ETL in PSC devices due to several factors. For instance, ZnO is hygroscopic in nature, which could cause perovskite decomposition under ambient air. ZnO also has poor chemical stability as it easily reacts with weak bases or acids. Furthermore, PSCs based on low-temperature processed ZnO as an ETL were environmentally unstable because the remaining hydroxyl residues on the ETL surface could accelerate decomposition of the perovskite structure.

Therefore, scientists and researchers have started to change their research interest to using SnO2 as an ETL in PSCs, due to the unique properties of this material. Several groups reported that SnO2 displayed a band gap of 3.8 eV and electron mobility of 250 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of the TiO2 or ZnO counterparts. Faster electron mobility could enhance the electron transport ability of the ETL whereas a wider band gap could avoid absorption of high energy photons by the ETL, which could lead to small current loss. In addition, SnO2 nanoparticles have the advantages of possessing good anti-reflective properties and thermal stability. In comparison to TiO2, SnO2 is less hygroscopic in nature, has better UV stability and lower photocatalytic activity. These properties of SnO2 hinder the degradation of the perovskite layer and ensure long term stability of the device. Since the TCO used in the fabrication of the perovskite solar cells is typically based on doped-tin oxide (e.g. FTO and ITO), thus the employment of SnO2 as an ETL could lead to zero lattice mismatch and defect reduction.

The performance of PSC devices based on a SnO2 compact layer depends on several parameters including the fabrication technique, type of precursor and solvent, as well as the temperature of deposition. A number of fabrication methods have been adopted to deposit a SnO2 compact layer in PSCs, such as spin coating, atomic layer deposition (ALD), plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD), chemical bath deposition, pulse laser deposition (PLD), and electron beam (E-beam) evaporation. In order to prepare a SnO2 thin film, chloride-based precursors such as tin dichloride (SnCl2) and tin tetrachloride (SnCl4) are usually selected because the cost is cheaper and easy to handle. Moreover, alcohols are typically used to dissolve the precursors instead of water since employing water as a solvent may increase the amount of Sn(OH)2 nanoparticle in solution, which would lead to the inhomogeneous formation of a SnO2 layer and subsequently an increased recombination rate. This was proven by Murugadoss et al. whose PSC devices demonstrated a PCE enhancement of 27% when ethanol was used instead of water as solvent to prepare SnCl2 precursors.

Previously, the fabrication of a SnO2 compact layer involved high temperature annealing. However, high temperature annealing resulted in an increased of charge recombination and lower CBM of SnO2 (about 0.1 eV relatively lower than that of TiO2). The lower CBM caused a reduction in the VOC value since the build-up potential of the PSC device is partially determined by the difference between the conduction band edge of ETL and valence band edge of HTL. Various countermeasures have been used to solve these problems including the introduction of a passivation layer, the development of mesoporous PSC, and doping with other metals.
Rao et al. discovered that the PCE greatly increased from 6.5% to 14.7% after treating the compact SnO2 with TiCl4 solution twice. In addition to surface passivation, the TiCl4 treatment also enhanced the wettability of the ETL, which enabled smoother formation of the perovskite layer. Dong and co-workers reported that the utilization of a mesoporous TiO2 layer on a high temperature processed SnO2 compact layer demonstrated a device efficiency of 10.3%. However, the PCE varied greatly if a mask was used during the J–V measurement. Here, it is worth mentioning that doping high temperature processed SnO2 with 7.5% magnesium reduced the charge recombination rate and increased the electron mobility of SnO2, but the device efficiency still did not exceed 15%.
Ke et al. discovered that PSCs that employed low temperature processed compact SnO2 displayed superior performances than high temperature processed SnO2 and TiO2-based devices with PCE offsets of 5% (Fig. 13a) and 2%, respectively. This was ascribed to the improved properties of the SnO2 compact layer including: (i) the better surface coverage, which annihilated pin-hole formation, (ii) the wider band gap and improved light scattering property, which increased the light transmittance (FTO coated with a SnO2 layer had higher light transmittance than bare FTO, as depicted in Fig. 13b), (iii) the lower free electron density and greater electron mobility, which reduced the recombination rate, and (iv) the higher conduction band edge, which ensured high build-up potential and high VOC value.
The devices based on low temperature processed SnO2 also indicated a reduced hysteresis effect, which means that the recorded performance was more reliable. This was proven by Baena and co-workers as they fabricated a PSC based on SnO2 as an ETL with a certified PCE of 18.4% using a low temperature ALD method. The dependence of the SnO2-based device on the scan rate of the J–V measurement was less pronounced in comparison to the TiO2-based device counterpart (Fig. 13c and d). This was mainly attributed to the excellent electron extraction of the low temperature processed SnO2 thin film.
The deposition temperature of the SnO2 compact layer was further reduced to 100 °C through the adoption of a PEALD method. A stable device with PCE of 19.0% and negligible hysteresis was observed after the SnO2 layer was passivated with a C60-self-assembled-monolayer. Recently, Chen et al. adopted a PLD method that completely removed the annealing procedure for the deposition of a very thin SnO2 layer with a thickness of 8 nm. This enabled the fabrication of both rigid and flexible devices with PCE values up to 17.3% and 14.0%, respectively. Until now, several groups managed to prepare planar PSCs based on SnO2 as an ETL with PCE values greater than 20%. The impressive performance was not solely contributed to by the SnO2 compact ETL, but also by the perovskite layer and HTL. However, an appropriate energy band alignment between SnO2 and the perovskite materials, along with the excellent morphological property, were found to be the major factors that contributed to the enhancement of the device efficiency.
In order to allow PSC technology to enter the photovoltaic market in the near future, a fabrication technique for vast production is absolutely necessary. Hence, an E-beam evaporation method that can manufacture hundreds of SnO2 thin films at once was developed. Under optimal conditions, an impressive device PCE of 18.2% was attained, while the performance reduced by merely 3% after over a month of storage, indicating that this technique holds good prospect for commercialization.

To date, SnO2 scaffolds that have been developed for PSC applications comprise of nanoparticle, nanorod, nanowire, and nanosheet based mesoporous SnO2. For nanoparticle-based devices, a PCE of 6.5% was achieved by employing a 200 nm thick mesoporous SnO2 layer. Similar to the planar based devices discussed previously, treating the SnO2 mesoporous layer with TiCl4 significantly improved the VOC, due to the enhancement of charge transfer and the recombination resistance properties, which subsequently increased the PCE to 10.2%. TiCl4 treatment also improved the PCE values of the devices based on single crystal SnO2 nanorods from 3.8% to 8.5% as reported by Zhu and co-workers. Han et al. observed a better PCE (14.2%) for PSCs based on single-crystalline SnO2 nanowires as the cores and the epitaxial rutile TiO2 nanolayers as shells in comparison to the PSC devices based on the mp-TiO2 nanoparticles (PCE = 12.3%). Like TiO2 and ZnO, the one dimensional SnO2 nanostructures also exhibited faster electron transport property which was the key factor that contributed to the higher PCE of the PSCs.

Nevertheless, the relatively poor PCE suffering from the use of a mesoporous SnO2-based PSC might be related to the high temperature process that was applied during the fabrication of the SnO2 layer. Therefore, a low temperature (100 °C) hydrothermal method was adopted to grow compact and nanosheet SnO2 simultaneously, breaking the 15% efficiency threshold. Here, it is important to note that most mesoporous SnO2-based devices can provide better protection for the perovskite against UV light and moisture induced degradation, even without a UV-filter or encapsulation, in comparison to a mesoporous TiO2 layer (Fig. 13e), owing to the unique properties of SnO2 as described earlier.Table 6 compares the device performances of both planar and mesoporous PSCs based on SnO2 as an ETL with TiO2-based PSC counterparts where possible.

Other types of transition metal oxide have also been utilized as ETLs in PSCs, including WO3, In2O3, niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), and cerium oxide (CeO). These materials were chosen mainly because of their excellent electron mobility and appropriate energy band alignment. Wang et al. showed that the WO3 compact layer can be fabricated through a low temperature processing technique where the corresponding device demonstrated substantially larger JSC due to better charge extraction and light transmitting properties. In addition, the insertion of mixed fullerene functionalized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on the WO3 compact layer to passivate the surface defects and reduce ion migration produced a hysteresis-free device with PCE of 14.9%. Mahmood et al. recorded a maximum PCE of 11.2% for the PSC that employed mesoporous WO3 nanosheets, which was higher than WO3 nanorods and nanoparticle-based devices. As they are identical to TiO2, WO3 nanosheets provided faster electron transporting characteristics, formed better porous structures for perovskite infiltration, improved the electron lifetime, and eliminated the existence of lattice defects and grain boundaries in the device. Nonetheless, the stability of the WO3-based device under UV light was poorer than TiO2-based devices as a consequence of the presence of oxygen vacancies in the WO3 layer.

In contrast, In2O3 is more stable under UV illumination in comparison to TiO2. However, the fabrication of an In2O3 compact layer with uniform structure is a challenging task. With very good control of the morphology of the ETL, Dong et al. showed that the application of an In2O3 compact layer in PSC could lead to device efficiency of 9.9%. At the same time, Qin and colleagues showed that a high temperature process is unfavourable for the deposition of an In2O3 compact layer due to the formation of larger grain sizes, which increased the film roughness. Thus, the introduction of PCBM as a passivation layer on the In2O3 film improved the device efficiency to 14.8% and reduced the hysteresis effect.
Meanwhile, Kogo et al. proved that the employment of Nb2O5 as an ETL could lead to a larger VOC value compared to the TiO2-based ETL owing to the stronger blocking effect of Nb2O5. Nevertheless, the hysteresis behaviour is severe in a Nb2O5-based PSC, which is caused by the high interfacial resistance, where this effect could be eliminated by introducing mesoporous TiO2 on compact Nb2O5. Very recently, it was found that a room temperature processed Nb2O5 ETL (PCE = 17.1%) can work as efficiently as its high temperature annealed counterpart (PCE = 17.2%). The former device exhibited slight VOC reduction owing to the decrement in the Fermi level but this issue was compensated with the increment in JSC as a result of the higher transmittance and smoother surface.
Nowadays, PSCs that use an alpha phase Fe2O3 (α-Fe2O3) or so-called hematite show very stable performance mainly because α-Fe2O3 promotes the formation of larger perovskite grains. The device also showed hysteresis but the effect is less severe than the TiO2-based counterpart as a result of the stronger driving force for charge injection at the perovskite/ETL interface. Nonetheless, compact α-Fe2O3 suffers from parasitic light absorption owing to the narrow band gap of α-Fe2O3 (ca. 2.2 eV). Thus, a nano-island structure was developed on compact α-Fe2O3 to improve the light transmittance and scattering properties, which enhanced the device PCE by 3.4% (absolute value) while further reducing the hysteresis behaviour. Another potential candidate to replace TiO2 as an ETL is CeO2 where the corresponding PSC has exhibited a PCE of 17.0% in the presence of a PCBM passivation layer.
The potential of some ternary oxides, such as strontium titanate (SrTiO3), zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) and barium tin oxide (BaSnO3), as ETLs in PSC applications has also raised the interest among scientists. SrTiO3 has been applied as a mesoporous ETL by Bera et al. and the fabricated devices exhibited a maximum PCE of 7.6%. The low device performance was attributed to poor contact surface area between SrTiO3 and the perovskite layer as a consequence of the large particle size of SrTiO3. On the other hand, the PSC device consisted of a 100 nm thick layer of compact Zn2SnO4 and 300 nm thick layer of mesoporous Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles and displayed a PCE of up to 7.0%. It was found that a PSC based on Zn2SnO4 had better charge-collecting property than its TiO2-based counterpart, but the overall performance of a Zn2SnO4-based cell was still poor mainly because of the low JSC generated owing to the high charge recombination.
Mali and co-workers synthesized Zn2SnO4 nanofiber-based PSCs and attained a PCE of 7.4%. The hysteresis effect was observed in this type of PSC, which was related to the thickness and random deposition of the nanofibers. However, it is believed that the optimization of the thickness and diameter of the Zn2SnO4 nanofibers could solve this issue. Meanwhile, Zhu and colleagues reported that an optimized mesoporous BaSnO3-based PSC had better performance than its mp-TiO2-based PSC counterpart with PCE offset of 1.2%. BaSnO3 not only has higher electron mobility (320 cm2 V−1 s−1) than TiO2, but it also displayed a similar perovskite structure to the perovskite light absorber, which reduced the crystal boundaries and enabled homogeneous formation of the photoactive material.
The ability of some metal sulphides like ZnS, CdS and In2S3 to work as an ETL had also been explored. It was discovered that CdS could work well as an ETL in planar PSCs where it delivered device efficiency as high as 11.2%, which was comparable to its TiO2-based PSC counterpart. Moreover, the application of CdS as an ETL is advantageous in terms of the capability of low temperature processing. On the other hand, ZnS-based planar PSCs showed extremely low PCE as a consequence of a higher CBM of ZnS in relation to the CBM of the perovskite, which retarded the electron transfer process. However, ZnS, which is less toxic than CdS, has great potential as an ETL in a tin-based PSC (e.g. FASnI3) due to the appropriate energy level alignment. Meanwhile, PSCs employing In2S3 nanoflakes demonstrated 16% PCE enhancement and lower hysteresis with respect to the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles. While showing high stability and non-toxic property, In2S3 can be processed at low temperature and possesses high carrier mobility (more than 17 cm2 V−1 s−1), which promotes electron injection. Another alternative for the substitution of TiO2 as an ETL is CdSe, which can be fabricated via a low temperature solution process. Optimized PSCs with a CdSe compact layer gave a PCE of 11.7%.

Non-ETLs, such as Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2, have also been selected for the construction of mesoporous PSCs. These materials can act purely as a scaffold for perovskite material loading but are unable to further transport electrons from a perovskite light harvester due to the inappropriate energy band alignment. The employment of non-ETLs as a scaffold layer usually enhances the VOC of PSC, which in turn increases the PCE. The generated VOC in a PSC is in part determined by the difference between the quasi Fermi level of the electrons in an n-type material and the quasi Fermi level of the holes in a p-type material.

Since electron transfer from the perovskite through Al2O3, ZrO2 or SiO2 is impossible due to the higher conduction band level, the photoexcited electrons remained in and diffused through the perovskite, making the perovskite itself an n-type material (Fig. 14). This mechanism is similar to the electron transport process in a planar heterojunction PSC. The higher CBM of the perovskite compared to TiO2 enables a higher generation of VOC. The higher VOC value also partially originated from the significant reduction of the chemical capacitance of the solar cells. Other than that, the electron extraction rate in a non-ETL-based PSC was found to be ten times faster than the TiO2-based PSC counterpart since electron diffusion through the perovskite layer is faster than through mesoporous TiO2. The high concentration of low energy electrons in the CBM of TiO2 may also induce charge recombination. Another advantage of using non-ETL as a scaffold is that the electron–hole recombination will not be aggravated, although the HTM is in contact with the exposed scaffold.
Some groups recorded higher PCE for non-ETL-based PSCs in comparison to devices that applied mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles. Lee et al. found that Al2O3-based PSCs showed higher PCE of 10.9% as compared to TiO2-based devices. ZrO2-based PSCs also displayed a higher PCE of 10.8% relative to PSCs using a TiO2 mesoporous layer (PCE = 9.5%). Likewise, Hwang et al. recorded a PCE enhancement of 12% for PSCs employing mesoporous SiO2 with respect to mesoporous TiO2-based PSCs. In spite of the positive achievements mentioned above, a PSC based on a non-ETL typically suffered from a severe hysteresis effect and poor stability, as explained in the earlier section of this review.
The investigations on non-ETL-based PSCs still need further exploration in order to gather more information on the properties and behaviour of this type of device. Currently, it was known that low temperature annealing at 150 °C was sufficient to fabricate an Al2O3 scaffold with a comparable PCE of 12.3%. Since high temperature annealing is unnecessary, the fabrication of Al2O3-based PSCs can be further simplified by co-depositing a mixture of Al2O3 nanoparticles and perovskite precursors, followed by low temperature heating. However, a decreased JSC was observed, which led to a low PCE of 7.2%. So far, a detailed study on the temperature effect of other non-ETL scaffolds, such as ZrO2 and SiO2, is not available. Fig. 15 summarizes the energy levels and electron mobility, as well as the preferable temperature processing, of various inorganic materials as ETLs in current PSCs.
The infiltration of perovskite materials into the scaffold framework is very important to obtain a high performance PSC and it can be optimized by tailoring the size of the mesoporous nanoparticles. Hence, Hwang et al. showed that SiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 50 nm delivered the best device efficiency. The optimum size of the SiO2 nanoparticles was actually similar to the optimum size of TiO2 as described in the previous section. Smaller SiO2 nanoparticles inhibited perovskite penetration, which caused low light absorption, while larger nanoparticles resulted in a complex scattering effect. Later, it was discovered that replacing SiO2 nanoparticles with SiO2 nanorods could improve the PCE by 13% from an initial value of 12.3% with the SiO2 nanorods providing a larger permeable space for the perovskite layer. A SiO2-based PSC also showed less hysteresis behaviour than its Al2O3-based device counterpart, owing to the low defect density in the mesoporous SiO2 layer, which inhibited charge trapping/detrapping in the device.Table 7 shows the device performances of PSCs according to their electron transporting materials.

It is worth mentioning in this review that, since PSCs appear to be the most promising candidates for future flexible solar cells, low temperature processable ETL-like organic materials are highly desirable. Nevertheless, organic semiconductors have been applied usually in an inverted p–i–n configuration since the fabrication of a pinhole-free film using an organic-based ETL in a conventional n–i–p type device is rather difficult. Fullerene-based molecules, for instance C60 and PCBM, are organic materials that have gained broad attention in this field as they were found to minimize the density of defects at the perovskite/ETL interface, which is responsible for charge recombination. In an n–i–p type PSC, the C60 thin layer has been successfully deposited using spin coating and vacuum thermal evaporation technique. C60 has a relatively low band gap around 1.7 eV, which can cause parasitic light absorption and hence, achieving a very thin layer of C60 is of great importance. Ke et al. reported that vacuum processed C60 with a thickness of 7.5 nm could push the JSC and FF values of PSC to the maximum, leading to a PCE of 15.1%. On the other hand, the employment of C60 as an ETL helped to avoid trapped charge-induced degradation in the presence of moisture. As represented in Fig. 16a, the degradation of the perovskite film based on a C60 ETL started from the HTL-side, while the perovskite degraded faster at the ETL-side in a TiO2-based device. This is due to the fact that moisture could react with the perovskite and caused irreversible degradation only at the region where trapped charges exist. Since C60 can extract photoexcited electrons more effectively than TiO2, it hindered electron accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface and consequently ensured good stability of the perovskite.

Meanwhile, PCBM was applied as a single ETL because it can be processed at low temperature, has compatible energy level alignment with respect to the perovskite, and possesses very good electron extraction property. Nevertheless, the fabrication of PCBM in a n–i–p type PSC requires meticulous control. This is due to the fact that PCBM is easily dissolved in a non-polar solvent like chlorobenzene or toluene. In PSC fabrication, where solvent-engineering technique is adopted, the non-polar solvent is dropped onto the perovskite layer during spin coating to produce a uniform and dense perovskite film. Moreover, the commonly used HTL (e.g. spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA) is also dissolved in the mentioned solvent. The involvement of a non-polar solvent for the fabrication of perovskite and/or HTL layers is too risky as it can wash away or partially dissolve the PCBM underlayer, which leads to poor hole blocking ability and eventually deteriorates the device performance. Therefore, a 100% perfect surface coverage of a perovskite film is absolutely necessary for the use of PCBM in an n–i–p type device. For conventional planar PSC, Ryu et al. obtained a PCE of 15.3% by employing a 55 nm thick PCBM layer as a single ETL. On top of that, the use of PC71BM instead of PC61BM appeared to result in superior device efficiency. Upama et al. explained that PC71BM ETL gave a major boost to the VOC of PSC due to the formation of a larger grain size of perovskite film (Fig. 16b). This was attributed to the reduced surface wettability of PC71BM compared to PC61BM, which reduced the surface tension dragging force and assisted the growth of larger perovskite grains. The lower charge transfer resistance at perovskite/PC71BM completely removed the hysteresis effect that was observed in the PC61BM-based PSC.
As described in the previous section, PCBM was widely utilized as a passivation layer for an inorganic-based ETL including TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, WO3, and In2O3. All the PSC devices demonstrated performance enhancement, particularly in the FF value, and significant reduction of the hysteresis effect. For instance, the device PCE increased from 14.4% to 17.9% when the TiO2 ETL was passivated with PCBM. A similar phenomenon was observed by Ke et al. where a PSC based on SnO2/PCBM ETLs exhibited 31% and 16% higher efficiency, respectively, in comparison to devices with single PCBM or single SnO2. This was ascribed to the cooperative function of both the metal oxide and PCBM as an ETL. PCBM has better charge extraction properties than metal oxide, which reduced the charge accumulation and recombination at the perovskite/ETL interface. In addition, PCBM could diffuse along the perovskite grain boundaries, subsequently passivating further defects and ion migration. However, the diffusion of PCBM created pinholes and PCBM itself could not effectively block the injection of holes owing to its smaller band gap. So, the metal oxide layer compensated these drawbacks by hindering the direct contact between the perovskite and TCO while improving the hole blocking ability.
Another organic material that attracts scientific attention is graphene and the first attempt to employ graphene as an independent ETL in PSC was reported by Wang et al. The device showed only 2.2% higher PCE than the ETL-free device but 4.1% lower PCE than the TiO2-based counterpart. Since graphene has no charge selective property and extremely high conductivity (as high as 200000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is ascribed to its low intrinsic charge carrier concentration), the use of pristine graphene as an ETL was postulated to introduce new recombination centers and deteriorated the VOC and JSC value. However, coupling graphene with TiO2 significantly increased the overall performance up to 15.6%.Fig. 16c shows that the graphene/TiO2 composite provided a higher device performance than the single graphene or single TiO2 counterparts. Nowadays, graphene and reduced graphene oxide are mostly blended together with other inorganic materials to form a nanocomposite ETL to boost the electron collection efficiency in the PSC. On top of that, Tavakoli and his team synthesized a 3D reduced-graphene scaffold that has porous structure, large surface area, improved light trapping properties, high conductivity, and suitable Fermi level with respect to perovskite and TiO2. The employment of the scaffold between the compact TiO2 and perovskite layer led to a device efficiency of 17.2%.
Several groups have also studied ionic liquids as a replacement for TiO2 ETL. For instance, Yang et al. employed 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BenMeIM-Cl), which has an electron mobility of up to 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, as an ETL in flexible PSCs. Impressive PCE values of 15.0% and 16.1% were recorded for devices based on a standard CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and mixed perovskite, respectively. The same group also reported on the employment of TiO2/1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]BF4) as an ETL and attained a certified PCE of over 19%. Other than that, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([EMIM]PF6) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide ([EMIM]I) were also tested as single ETLs, which gave PCE values of 14.2% and 9.2%, respectively. Nonetheless, the PCE values of the respective devices were enhanced to 18.5% and 17.2% when a TiO2/ionic liquid double ETL was utilized. From the studies, the modification of the work function of the TCO or TiO2 underlayer and substantial reduction of hysteresis were observed when ionic liquids were employed as ETLs, but the effect was sensitively dependent on the nature of the cation and anion of the material. The anion part tends to attach to the FTO surface as a consequence of existing oxygen vacancies, whereas the cation has higher affinity to the perovskite because of its organic–inorganic nature, which induced a spontaneous dipolar polarization at the interfaces and modified the work function of the underlayer (Fig. 16d). The binding energy between the component of the ionic liquid and the corresponding layers determined the performance of the device. The photovoltaic parameters of the PSC with an organic-based and double ETL are tabulated in Table 8.

The general overview on the device architectures and photovoltaic properties of PSCs with regards to the presence and structure configuration of ETLs is elaborated in the early section of this review. Two different approaches have been highlighted to optimize the performance of the ETL in order to enhance the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs. The first approach is through the structural modification of the ETL into a nanostructure where nanostructure based-TiO2 has been chosen as the main subject of discussion. The second approach is via the substitution of TiO2 with other types of inorganic materials, such as ZnO, SnO2, CdS, CdSe, Al2O3 and ZrO2, as a compact ETL or scaffold layer. The properties of these materials and their impact towards the device performances of PSCs are discussed accordingly.

It is confirmed that the ETL is a crucial component in a PSC in the efforts to fabricate devices with high efficiency that are on par with their silicon and thin film counterparts. The presence of an ETL facilitates efficient electron extraction and smooth electron transporting in the PSC device, which eventually promotes a high JSC, improves the FF, and contributes to better device efficiency. The simplest architecture of PSC, which is referred to as a planar heterojunction device and is based on a compact ETL, exhibited high PCE but suffered from poor device stability and hysteresis behaviour.
The fabrication of a thin and pinhole-free compact ETL is essential as it refers to the fundaments of both planar and mesoporous PSC devices. Studies found that a standard planar device based on conventional spin-coated TiO2 as an ETL requires a compact layer with a thickness of about 60 nm. In order to further improve the performance of the ETL, it is wise to use other deposition techniques, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), potentiostatic anodization, or thermal oxidation, in contrast to conventional solution process techniques (i.e. spin coating, spray pyrolysis, or dip coating), where these techniques have the advantages of yielding homogeneous and pinhole-free layers at very low thicknesses of about 10 to 15 nm. A thinner compact ETL will reduce the series resistance and subsequently improve the JSC and PCE of the device. However, further investigations are necessary for those methods to reduce fabrication costs, simplify the process protocols, and optimize the properties of ETL.
It is widely known that the major issues that restrained the PSC from commercialization are the long-term stability and hysteresis behaviour. Fortunately, the presence of an ETL in the PSC could alleviate these problems. As stated previously, planar PSC still demonstrates inferior stability in comparison to the mesoporous device counterpart. However, planar PSC is advantageous in terms of the simplicity of fabrication and low production cost. To minimize the hysteresis effects in planar PSCs, the employment of double ETL compact layers or a passivation layer on top of the ETL is a good countermeasure because such a layer can improve interface and junction formation. Thus, future research should focus on improving the interface between the perovskite and ETL in order to solve this issue.
Meanwhile, most highly efficient and stable PSC devices are based on a mesoporous nanostructure where a number of morphological parameters of ETL, such as structure or configuration, thickness or length, size or diameter, and density, played vital roles in determining the efficiency of the PSC. A few groups have confirmed the superiority of mesoporous ETLs compared to compact ETL structures in the viewpoints of device performance, stability and hysteresis. Modifying the structural properties of ETL majorly improved the JSC and FF values of the devices. For commercial application in the near future, the production of mesoporous PSCs is highly recommended.
In a standard mesoporous PSC, the use of spherical TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 50 nm and layer thickness of 220 nm is needed in addition to the previously mentioned compact ETL layer. As discussed in this review, a higher dimensionality of mesoporous nanostructure based ETL has been observed in yielding a better device performance. Therefore, the future work on the enhancement of device efficiency should be focused on the 3D types of ETL nanostructure and multi-structured mesoporous ETL. Since all of these nanostructures have their own advantages and weaknesses, it is too early to make a thorough conclusion regarding the dimensionality of the ETL nanostructures. Even one of the best performing PSC devices with an efficiency of more than 20% is simply based on a 150 nm thick layer of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles with a merely 60 nm thick HBL. This indicates that there are large pools of other parameters that need to be optimized during the fabrication of PSCs to attain high power conversion efficiency devices.
For instance, most of the research works that have investigated TiO2 nanorod-based PSCs nowadays are still mainly focused on the effect of nanorod length rather than the diameter, density or orientation. That is why the current PCE achievement for nanorod-based devices still does not yet exceed 20%. In spite of this, several studies have proven the better long-term stability of nanorod-based PSCs in relation to the nanoparticle-based counterparts, owing to the thermodynamic stability of the nanorods. Therefore, it is believed that nanorod-based PSCs are a good alternative to obtain highly efficient and stable PSCs for commercialization in the near future. To achieve this goal, the morphological parameters of the nanorods should be explored further in order to have deep understanding of the tailoring of the properties and the effect of the TiO2 nanorod structure on the device performance.
On top of this, the long term stability of the PSCs based on 2D, 3D, and multi-structured mesoporous ETLs must also be investigated further due to the lack of information regarding this matter. Besides, there are vast nanostructures of mesoporous ETL that have been developed for DSSCs, but have not yet been applied in PSCs, such as TiO2 nanobelts, nanocoral, etc. Each of these structures has its unique properties, which might be found suitable for producing high performance and long-term stability of the PSCs. The structural optimization of an ETL is an effective way to enhance the device performance of the PSC.
Moreover, the material selection for an ETL is another vital aspect that determines the high efficiency and long-term stability of the PSC devices. In general, ETLs with higher electron mobility are favourable as they could enhance the electron transport properties and increase the JSC value. Nonetheless, since each material has unique charge transfer properties and CBM value, the VOC of the device could be negatively affected due to electron–hole recombination and loss in build-up potential. This effect could be alleviated through structural modification, layer passivation, and band alignment engineering. The application of non-ETLs in PSCs has the potential to increase the VOC, but hysteresis behaviour is still a major issue for this type of device.
To date, TiO2 appears to be the most employed inorganic material as an ETL in PSCs. Thus, the fabrication methods of TiO2 as ETLs have matured within a short period of time and its properties are well studied, which enables scientists to fabricate highly efficient PSCs based on this material. However, TiO2 requires high temperature sintering to form nanocrystallites, which inhibits or limits its application on flexible substrates and increases production costs. Other metal oxides including WO3, In2O3, and Nb2O5, ternary metal oxides such as Zn2SnO4, SrTiO3 and BaSnO3, as well as other inorganic materials like CdS and CdSe, have also shown interesting properties as electron transporting materials. Meanwhile, non-ETLs, such as Al2O3, ZrO2 and SiO2, which purely act as a scaffold could increase the VOC of PSC. However, more studies have to be conducted on utilizing these materials as a potential ETL, so that a variety of PSCs for different applications can be explored.
ZnO and SnO2, which have higher electron mobilities than TiO2, could enhance the JSC of solar cells. Processing at a low temperature is also preferable for these materials in order to function well as an ETL. Although the VOC and FF values of devices based on these materials are averagely lower than those of TiO2-based PSCs, they can be enhance through band alignment engineering, such as doping, surface passivation and structural modification. Currently, the efficiencies of PSC devices based on ZnO or SnO2 as the ETLs have achieved up to 17.7% and 20.7%, respectively, while their applications on flexible substrates have also shown promising results. In terms of the long term stability and hysteresis effect, SnO2-based PSCs in particular have shown extraordinary device performances, despite less studies on this material having been conducted. Unlike TiO2, which is relatively unstable under UV-light, and ZnO, which is chemically unstable, SnO2 is seen as good candidate for use as an ETL, due to its excellent optical and electrical properties, that should be investigated profoundly in future work.
In the meantime, scientific interest in organic-based semiconductors as ETLs has started to gain momentum due to the impressive electron extraction properties and low temperature processability of organic materials. The remarkable reduction of the hysteresis effect was recognized by researchers when organic-based ETLs, such as C60, PCBM and ionic liquids, were adopted in PSCs. In spite of this, the exploitation of organic materials in n–i–p type PSCs is still lagging behind those of inorganic materials, most probably as a consequence of the lack of an acceptable deposition technique to acquire a uniform and dense perovskite film on organic-based ETLs. Yet, the incorporation of an inorganic–organic double ETL alleviated the hysteresis issue and fostered the overall performance, which may open up a new direction for future PSC research.
