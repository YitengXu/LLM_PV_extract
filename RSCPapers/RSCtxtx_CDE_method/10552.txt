Templating effects on the growth of lead phthalocyanine (PbPc) and the performance of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have been investigated by using three copper halogen compounds (CuCl, CuBr, CuI), possessing different lattice parameters, as templating layers. The crystallinity of the PbPc films was highest on CuI followed by CuBr and CuCl, resulting in the broadening of the Q-band absorption in the same order. The templating effects were described by heteroepitaxial growth of organic molecules on the templating layers. The dimensionless potential calculated using a lattice model for the overlayer–substrate systems showed good correlation between the degree of epitaxy and the crystallinity of the PbPc overlayers. Furthermore, the performance of the OPVs was consistent with both the prediction from the calculation results and the observation from the optical and structural analyses.

Control of crystal structure and the orientation of molecules is an important research topic for organic electronics, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), because the optical and electrical properties of the films strongly depend on them. One of the methods to control the crystal structure of molecules is to use a templating layer. Organic templating layers, such as 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), 2,5-bis(4-biphenylyl)-bithiophene (BP2T), oxovanadium phthalocyanine (VOPc), sexithiophene (6T), para-sexiphenylene (p-6P), diindenoperylene (DIP) and pentacene, have been used to control the crystal structure and/or the crystallinity of organic donor materials, such as metal phthalocyanines. Recently, CuI has been introduced as an effective templating material to control the crystal structure or the molecular orientation of copper phthalocyanine, zinc phthalocyanine and lead phthalocyanine (PbPc) molecules. The OPVs showed nearly a twofold enhancement in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) by inserting a CuI templating layer. However, there are few reports on the mechanism of the templating effect of the CuI layer therefore it is not clearly understood yet.

In this work, we report that the templating effects originate from the epitaxial growth of organic molecules. CuCl, CuBr and CuI, possessing different lattice spacings, were selected as the templating layers. In addition, PbPc was used as the organic donor material to analyse the templating effect because the increase in the crystallinity of a PbPc film is easily monitored through changes in the absorption peaks at wavelengths of 740 nm and 900 nm. These wavelengths are related to the amorphous or the monoclinic phases and the triclinic phases, respectively. The dimensionless potential between the copper halogen compound substrate and the PbPc overlayer, calculated using a lattice model, showed that the degree of epitaxy increases in the order CuCl, CuBr and CuI. This is consistent with the experimental results of the crystallinity, the absorption of the PbPc films on the templating layers and the resulting device performance.

The control device had the following planar heterojunction structure: indium tin oxide (ITO) (150 nm)/PbPc (20 nm)/C60 (40 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO-coated glass substrate was successively cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The substrate was exposed to UV–O3 for 10 min before use. All of the organic layers were deposited using thermal evaporation at a base pressure of ca. 10−7 Torr at a rate of 1 Å s−1, without breaking the vacuum. CuCl, CuBr and CuI layers were also thermally deposited onto the substrate at a rate of 0.2 Å s−1. The devices had an active area of 2 × 2 mm2. A patterned insulator on the ITO and the top cathode, deposited through a shadow mask, defined the cell area. After fabrication, the devices were encapsulated, using an epoxy resin, within glass cans under an N2 atmosphere. More than 8 cells for each device structure were fabricated and the mean values of the photovoltaic performances and standard deviations were obtained. The photovoltaic properties of the devices were measured with an AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 solar simulator (300 W Oriel 69911A) light source and a source measurement unit (Keithley 237). The measurement set up was calibrated with a National Renewable Energy Laboratory-certified reference Si-solar cell covered with a KG-5 filter before every measurement. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the films were recorded with a VARIAN Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The crystal structures of films were investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 5 A X-ray scattering beamline for materials science of Pohang Light Source II (PLS-II). The X-ray wavelength was 1.071 Å (11.58 keV). The films were deposited on ITO substrates. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images of the films were taken using a PSIA XE-100 scanning probe microscope in the non-contact mode.


The templating effect of the copper halogen compounds on the absorption of the PbPc films is shown in Fig. 1. The 20 nm-thick PbPc film was deposited on 3 nm-thick CuCl, CuBr and CuI coated ITO substrates. The intensity of the absorption peak at 740 nm, in the Q-band absorption of PbPc, gradually decreased in the order CuCl, CuBr and CuI. The peak at 900 nm gradually developed in the same order resulting in a twofold enhancement after inserting the CuI layer. The broadened Q-band absorption of the PbPc film can be attributed to the increase of the monoclinic phase in the film. Grazing incident angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was performed, with an incident angle of 0.2°, to investigate the crystalline properties of the PbPc films and the GIXD patterns of the samples are depicted in Fig. 2(a). The pristine 20 nm-thick PbPc film on ITO, without the templating layers, presents diffraction peaks at Q = 8.89 nm−1 and Q = 11.72 nm−1 which are assigned as the (320) plane of the monoclinic PbPc phase and the (10) plane of the triclinic phase, respectively. The diffraction peak of the (11) plane of the triclinic phase is seen at Q = 9.15 nm−1. The intensity of the (320) plane diffraction peak of the monoclinic PbPc phase gradually increased in the order of CuCl, CuBr and CuI, which is the same trend as the broadening of the Q-band absorption peak.

The diffraction patterns of the same samples after the deposition of a 40 nm-thick C60 layer on top of the PbPc layer are shown in Fig. 2(b). The diffraction peaks at Q = 7.69 nm−1, Q = 12.64 nm−1 and Q = 14.87 nm−1 are assigned to the (111) plane, (220) plane and (311) plane of the face centered cubic (FCC) phase of C60, respectively. The diffraction peaks of the (320) plane of the monoclinic PbPc phase and the (11) plane of the triclinic PbPc phase disappeared after the deposition of the C60 layer. This indicates that the crystal structure is demolished by the deposition of the C60 molecules due to the interaction with C60 at the interface or the diffusion of C60 molecules into the organic layer. This can take place because large portions of the PbPc crystal structure are located near the surface, exhibiting this thickness dependent phase transition. However, the diffraction peaks of PbPc grown on the copper halogen compounds are retained after the deposition of the C60 layer. This indicates that the crystalline PbPc in the film, grown on the copper halogen compounds, is less affected by the deposition of a C60 layer. This is due to the fact that the crystalline PbPc locates near the interface between the copper halogen compounds and the PbPc or are distributed across the whole layer.
The templating effect was analysed based on the concept of heteroepitaxy where the molecule–substrate bonding, due to electrostatic interactions between the molecules and the anion in the ionic compounds, is considered as the driving force that controls the crystal structure and the molecular orientation of the organic molecules. The dimensionless potential V/V0 has been calculated by a simple analytic method to evaluate the heteroepitaxial system by considering the geometrical lattice mismatch. This approach can be used to analyse the phase coherence between overlayer and substrate unit cells and describe their potential energy as simple plane waves which are modelled by cosine functions. The value of V/V0 is determined by the degree of epitaxy between the overlayer and the substrate in the range −0.5 < V/V0 < 1 where V/V0 = 1 for incommensurism, V/V0 = 0.5 for coincidence, V/V0 = 0 and V/V0 = −0.5 for commensurism on a nonhexagonal and hexagonal substrate, respectively. First of all, we calculated the potential energy of a PbPc 55 × 55 overlayer on the series of copper halogen compounds, with the lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 14 Å, with a 0.001 Å grid. The copper halogen compounds have the zinc blende (111) structure on ITO substrates as shown in Fig. S1 and PbPc molecules are assumed to dominantly grow with the monoclinic (320) structure on the copper halogen compounds. The lattice parameters of the PbPc monoclinic phase and the copper halogen compounds used for the calculation are summarized in Table 1, which were taken from the literature. The schematic representation of the PbPc monoclinic (320) overlayer and zinc blende (111) ionic compound substrate is displayed, and the seven parameters, a1, a2, α′ and b1, b2, β′ representing the unit cells and the azimuthal angle θ between the overlayer and the substrate unit cells used in the calculations, are defined in Fig. 3(a). The dependence of the potential, V/V0, on the azimuthal angle, θ, of the PbPc 55 × 55 overlayer and CuCl, CuBr and CuI substrates used in this work is presented in Fig. 3(b). The calculation results predict the degree of epitaxy at specific angles. The minimum potential occurs when using CuCl and CuBr which possess potential values of 0.81 (25.7°), 0.74 (20.0°), respectively. CuI showed the smallest potential value of 0.63 at θ of 2.3°. This indicates that the PbPc monoclinic phase, with the (320) orientation, forms the coincidence epitaxy most favourably using CuI as the templating layer. The analysis predicts that the larger monoclinic crystals, with better crystallinity, are formed using the CuI templating layer, followed by CuBr and CuCl. This is in good agreement with the experimental results. The consistency between the experimental results and the theoretical analysis suggests that the templating effects originate from the heteroepitaxial growth of the PbPc films on the copper halogen compounds. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the organic thin films is closely related to the lattice parameters of the ionic compounds. In other words, the organic thin film is grown in a way that minimizes the strain energy between the molecule–substrate lattice mismatch. Growth of organic molecules on ionic compounds such as KBr, KCl and NaCl was previously explained by heteroepitaxy.

The AFM images in Fig. 4 illustrate the variation of the surface morphology of the 5 nm-thick PbPc films on the different copper halogen compound substrates. The initial growth of the PbPc monolayer molecules shows the Stranski–Krastanov (SK) mode on the CuI substrate and the Volmer–Weber (VW) mode on pristine ITO substrate due to the increase of the lattice mismatch. The surface coverage is largest on the CuI substrate and a large island of PbPc with a smaller coverage is formed on the pristine ITO substrate. The coverage of the PbPc films becomes larger with the increase in the thickness of the PbPc films.
The templating effects manifest in the performance of the OPVs. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices formed on different templating layers are represented in Fig. 5(a). The photovoltaic parameters, the parallel resistance (RP) and the series resistance (RS) extracted from the dark J–V curves, with the equivalent Shockley diode equation, are summarized in Table 2. The control device showed a PCE of 1.53% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 5.26 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.52 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.57. Insertion of CuCl, CuBr and CuI templating layers enhanced the JSC to 7.67, 7.60, 7.89 mA cm−2, and the PCE to 1.82, 1.97, 2.10%, respectively. The low FF of the device with CuCl is reflected in a high RS of 13.84 Ω cm2. This might be related to its deep valence band energy level (CuCl; 6.9 eV, CuBr; 5.6 eV, CuI; 5.0 eV) working as a potential barrier for hole-transport at the interface between ITO and the active layer. The increase in JSC originates from the enhancement of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the PbPc molecules (Fig. 5(b)). In our previous work, the exciton diffusion length (LD) increased with the enhancement of the crystallinity from the insertion of a templating layer. The GIXD results in Fig. 2(b) indicate that the copper halogen compounds prevent the PbPc film from losing the crystallinity after the deposition of C60. This is the origin of the higher LD and IPCE of the devices with the copper halogen compounds. In addition, decrease of the VOC from 0.52 V to 0.47 (CuCl), 0.47 (CuBr), 0.45 V (CuI) can be explained by the reduced band gap of the PbPc film due to the intermolecular interactions between molecules. This manifests as a red-shift in the absorption spectra of the PbPc films and IPCE spectra of the devices with the copper halogen compounds. Since VOC of the OPVs is related to the energy level difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor material, the change in VOC can be explained by the shift of the energy levels of the PbPc film.

We have investigated the templating effect of copper halogen compounds on PbPc films using the theory of heteroepitaxy. Simple lattice modelling predicted that the PbPc monoclinic phase, with the (320) orientation, forms the coincidence epitaxy most favourably using CuI as the templating layer. This minimizes the potential energy due to the smallest lattice mismatch between the organic crystal and the templating layer, followed by CuBr and CuCl. The change of phase and the enhancement in crystallinity of the PbPc film on the copper halogen compounds are consistent with our calculation; that the formation of the PbPc monoclinic phase with the (320) orientation is more pronounced and the crystallinity is enhanced in the sequence of CuI > CuBr > CuCl. In addition, the initial growth modes of the PbPc films are influenced by the degree of lattice mismatch between the organic crystal and the templating layer. A large mismatch (PbPc on ITO) resulted in the island (VW) growth mode with a low surface coverage, however a small mismatch (PbPc on CuI) resulted in the SK growth mode with a much better surface coverage. The different growth modes on the different templates apparently influences the performance of the PbPc based OPV; the templating layer with a small lattice mismatch resulted in higher PCEs in the sequence of CuI > CuBr > CuCl > none on ITO. We believe that the application of the concept of heteroepitaxy is not limited to our specific system but can be a general phenomenon in organic–organic and organic–inorganic multilayer systems. The degree of heteroepitaxy depends on the interaction energy between the templating layer and the overlayer. This heteroepitaxy has important applications not only in OPVs and OTFTs but also in every area where organic crystalline structures play important roles.
