We report the fabrication of a solution-processed cadmium sulfide (CdS) film and its application in inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). The CdS film is formed by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) process and exhibits an n-type semiconducting property. An efficient inverted PSC is fabricated using a CBD-grown CdS film as the electron collecting layer (ECL), which is inserted between the indium tin oxide (ITO) cathode and the polymer bulk heterojunction active layer. The experimental results reveal that the cell response parameters depend critically on the deposition procedures in terms of bath temperature, deposition time and annealing temperature. A two-fold increase in the overall power conversion efficiency of inverted PSCs is realized with the optimization of CBD-grown CdS film properties through the deposition for 2 h at 50 °C and the annealing treatment at 200 °C. The simple and low-cost deposition method of CdS films is promising for the fabrication of hybrid PSCs.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on conjugated polymers and fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composites are drawing much attention because of their potential as renewable energy sources with low cost, easy processing of large-area fabrication, and compatibility with flexible substrates. Although significant progress on PSCs has been made in the past decade, further improvement in efficiency and stability is required for practical applications as a cost-competitive and sustainable technology. Recently, the inverted-structure PSCs with transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) used as the bottom cathode have been proposed as a promising alternative for obtaining high device performance, which can satisfy the vertical phase separation in polymer BHJ and avoid the degradation induced by the oxidation of the reactive metal cathode in the regular structure.

The key to achieve high efficiency in the inverted PSCs is the selection of an electron collecting layer (ECL) between the ITO cathode and the electron acceptor layer, which can provide a low resistive pathway for efficient electron extraction and the sufficient hole blocking capability. Some n-type semiconductors, including titanium oxide (TiOx), zinc oxide (ZnO), LiF, cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3), small molecules, or self-propagating molecule-based assemblies, have been applied as an ECL in inverted PSCs because of their excellent electron extraction property.
Recently, we have demonstrated the utilization of atomic layer deposited cadmium sulfide (CdS) film as an ECL in the inverted PSC because of its high electron mobility, wide direct band gap and environmental stability. According to the energy level alignment, the insertion of a CdS layer between the ITO cathode and the polymer active layer could provide a good energy level matching due to the well-aligned conduction band of CdS film with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the electron acceptor. However, for the low-cost fabrication of PSCs, it is highly desirable to prepare the functional layers in a solution-processed manner. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method for the preparation of CdS film as an ECL in inverted PSCs. Compared with other methods, including thermal deposition, chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, and atomic layer deposition, the CBD method is a convenient and low cost technique for growing thin films, and is compatible with the large-area fabrication at low processing temperature. A correlation between cell response parameters and the film properties of CBD-grown CdS layer is investigated, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted device is optimized by controlling the deposition procedures in terms of bath temperature, deposition time and annealing temperature.

The ITO glass substrates were pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner with acetone, ethanol and de-ionized (DI) water in sequence. After drying with nitrogen, the CBD process was carried out by vertically immersing the ITO glass substrates inside a beaker under different temperature conditions. Although many different variations exist for the growth of CdS by the CBD method, the precursor solutions used in this work were prepared by mixing 0.025 mol L−1 Cd(NO3)2, 0.15 mol L−1 sodium citrate, 0.05 mol L−1 thiourea and DI water, with concentrated ammonia of volume ratio of 2% to adjust the pH value. In the CBD process, the bath was covered for stabilizing the temperature and reducing the loss of ammonia. After deposition, the substrates were dried by flowing N2, and annealed on a hot plate at a certain temperature for different times in air. The film thickness of CBD-grown CdS was controlled by the deposition parameters. During the CBD process, the bare side of the ITO glass substrates was covered with tape to prohibit the growth of CdS films.


The device structure of the inverted PSCs is schematically shown in Fig. 1. All the process parameters for device fabrication were fixed except for the deposition parameters of the CdS layer. Details of the device fabrication are as following: the samples with CDB-grown CdS films were transferred into a N2-filled glove box to prepare a poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) photoactive layer, which was spin-coated from a 1:1 weight-ratio solution in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 40 mg mL−1, followed by annealing on a hot plate at 130 °C for 20 min in a glove box. The thickness of the resulting P3HT:PCBM blend film was determined to be approximately 125 nm. Then, the samples were transferred into a high vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr to complete the PSC device, where a 1.5 nm-thick MoO3 hole collecting layer and a 100 nm-thick Al anode were thermally evaporated through shadow masks. As shown in Fig. 1, the device area, as defined by the overlap between the ITO and Al electrodes, was 0.1 cm2. For comparison, the inverted devices employing CdS films under different deposition conditions were fabricated with the identical process parameters during the same batch processing.


The thickness of CdS and P3HT:PCBM films was calibrated by an alpha-SE™ Spectroscopic Ellipsometer. The UV-vis absorption and transmission measurements of the samples were employed at room temperature with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 750 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded by an FEI Quanta 200 FEG. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed in a Kratos AXIS Ultra-DLD ultrahigh vacuum system (a base pressure of 3 × 10−10 Torr) with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV).

Photovoltaic measurements were conducted without any device encapsulation. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the inverted PSC devices were examined with a programmable Keithley 2612 source meter under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination (Newport-Oriel solar simulators) with integrated intensity 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated with a silicon photodiode.

The surface morphologies of CBD-grown CdS films on ITO glass surfaces were investigated by SEM. Fig. 2a illustrates the representative SEM micrograph of a CBD-grown CdS film deposited at a bath temperature of 50 °C for 2 h. It is found that only some CdS nanoparticles were randomly grown on the substrate surface for a short deposition time (i.e., 0.5 h), which indicates that the reaction is still in the adsorption and nucleation state. However, the CdS film becomes thicker and denser with respect to the increase of the deposition time, and large CdS nanoparticles appear on the films with the continuous nucleation in the solution by a certain deposition time (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI).

The micrograph shown in Fig. 2b reveals that deposition temperature affects the surface morphology of CdS films. The increase of the deposition temperature from 50 °C to 80 °C results in an increase in growth rate and grain size, and a decrease in voids, which is consistent with the previous report that the deposition temperature in the CBD process plays a significant role in the film structure and properties of CdS films. Nevertheless, the film morphologies shown in Fig. 2a and 2b indicate that the CBD-grown CdS films could form an integrated and relatively flat thin film, which was supposed to be beneficial to the fabrication of PSCs.

Fig. 2c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CdS films deposited at different temperatures. It is evident that the CBD-grown CdS films at different deposition temperatures show a similar degree of crystallinity to the mixture of CdS and CdO. According to the XRD pattern, the CdS film predominantly exhibits the hexagonal structure. However, it is difficult to distinguish the crystallographic structure and exclude the existence of cubic CdS structure, since the peak at 2θ = 26.8° and 43.9° can be assigned to the (002) and (110) planes of hexagonal or the (111) and (220) planes of cubic CdS structure. As reported in the literature, the polycrystalline CdS film is the mixture of zinc blende (cubic) and wurtzite (hexagonal) crystals, which strongly depends upon factors such as deposition method, temperature, and time.
The optical absorption of the CBD-grown CdS films on ITO glass was examined with UV-vis spectroscopy. Fig. 2d shows the absorption spectra of the CdS films deposited at 50 °C and 80 °C, where an increase in the optical absorption below 500 nm is obvious due to the strong absorption near the band gap edge of CdS. In addition, it is noted that the deposition temperature has no impact on the bandgap except for the morphology of CBD-grown CdS films.
Thermal annealing treatment with several temperatures (i.e., 100 °C, 200 °C, and 300 °C) was utilized to optimize the crystallinity of CBD-grown CdS films. The surface morphologies of these CBD-grown CdS films with various annealing temperatures were examined by SEM measurement. As shown in Fig. 3, there is negligible change in morphology when the CBD-grown CdS films were treated below 200 °C. However, large CdS clusters on the film surface can be observed when the temperature was up to 300 °C. The XPS measurement was carried out to characterize the composition of CdS films with various annealing treatment.Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra for the CBD-grown CdS films deposited at 50 °C and 80 °C, where the Cd3d and S2p XPS core level spectra exhibit symmetric line shapes. According to the quantitative analysis of the Cd3d and S2p core level spectra, the atomic Cd/S ratios were determined as listed in Table 1. It is noted that the CBD-grown CdS films exhibit a non-stoichiometric structure within the error of the XPS characterization due to sulfur vacancies, and the Cd/S ratio increases with respect to the annealing temperature. Meanwhile, the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the annealing treatment results in the slight decrease of the band gap, which is consistent with the previous reports.

It has been demonstrated that the insertion of a CdS thin film between ITO glass and the active layer of P3HT:PCBM can provide a better energy level matching due to the well-aligned conduction band minimum of the CdS film with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the electron acceptor PCBM. The feasibility of CBD-grown CdS films as an ECL in inverted PSCs is thus investigated. Fig. 6 plots the J–V characteristics of inverted PSCs employing CdS films as an ECL under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar illumination, in which the CdS films deposited at 50 °C and 80 °C were thermally annealed at 100, 200, and 300 °C, respectively. Reasonable photovoltaic effect was observed with the incorporation of CdS film. Table 1 summarizes the device parameters. Note that the devices with CdS film annealed at 100 °C show poor short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF), implying that they provide an inferior function in terms of electron extraction and transport to the ITO cathode. In contrast, when the annealing temperature increases from 100 °C to 200 °C, the inverted PSC exhibits a remarkable improvement in the device performance. For example, JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE of the PSC with CdS deposited at 50 °C and annealed at 200 °C are 5.33 mA cm−2, 0.62 V, 42.97%, and 1.42%, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the CBD-grown CdS can act as an efficient ECL to enhance the efficiency of inverted PSCs. It is also noted that further increase of the annealing temperature to 300 °C will lead to the decrease of the device performance with lower JSC, VOC, and FF. For instance, the inverted device with CdS film deposited at 80 °C and annealed at 300 °C exhibits an antidiode behavior with a poor performance. The reduction in device performance is because higher annealing temperature induces the change of the film morphology and the Cd/S ratio, which is disadvantageous for photocurrent transport.

To further examine the key factors of CBD-grown CdS films affecting the device performance, two series of inverted PSCs incorporating CdS as an ECL were fabricated as a function of the film thickness of CdS deposited at 50 °C and 80 °C but annealed at 200 °C, respectively. To minimize effects due to different processing conditions, all the devices in each series were fabricated during the same batch processing. Fig. 7 plots the J–V characteristics of inverted PSCs incorporating CdS ECLs deposited at 50 °C with different CdS thickness under AM 1.5 G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark. According to the ellipsometer measurements, the resulting thicknesses of CdS films with the deposition time of 1, 2 and 3 h correspond to 10.9, 21.3 and 55.4 nm, respectively. Fig. 8 plots the corresponding J–V characteristics of inverted PSCs for different CdS films deposited at 80 °C. The corresponding CdS thicknesses are 29.1, 67.0, and 107.6 nm, respectively. The extracted device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The results in Fig. 7 and 8 clearly show the thickness dependence of inverted PSCs, and the photovoltaic parameters of JSC, VOC and FF increase significantly with an overall increase in PCE when the CdS deposition time increases. As shown in Table 2, the device incorporating CdS deposited at 50 °C with a deposition time of 2 h yields the best performance. In addition, the further increase of CdS deposition time or the film thickness leads to a reduction in JSC and VOC. A similar trend can be observed in the inverted PSCs with the CdS ECL deposited at 80 °C. However, it should be emphasized that the high deposition temperature will lead to the formation of large particles on the surface of CdS films (see Fig. S2 in the ESI), which increases short-circuit defects.

To understand the influence of CBD-grown CdS films with different thicknesses on the device performance, the optical property of CdS films with various deposition time on ITO glass substrates was performed with UV-vis spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of CdS films shown in Fig. 9 indicate the thickness-dependent absorbance in the range below 500 nm, although the absorption cutoff edge remains at an almost identical value. Therefore, the variation of inverted PSCs with CdS ECLs deposited under different conditions is associated with the balance between the film morphology and the optical properties.

In summary, the solution-processed CdS thin film by the chemical bath deposition method was used as an ECL in inverted PSCs. The growth conditions of CdS films, including bath temperature, growth duration, and annealing temperature have a significant impact on the device performance of PSCs. The overall power conversion efficiency of inverted PSCs was enhanced with the optimum of CBD-grown CdS film properties through the deposition for 2 h at 50 °C and the annealing treatment at 200 °C. The simple and low-cost deposition method of CdS films is promising for the hybrid PSC fabrication.
