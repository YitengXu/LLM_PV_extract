A series of organic dyes containing a phenothiazine central unit were synthesized and were used effectively in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A cyanoacrylate moiety was added at the C(3) position of the phenothiazine as an electron acceptor, and a triarylamine moiety was attached at the C(7) position as an electron donor. The DSSCs made with these dyes displayed remarkable quantum efficiency, ranging from 4.2–6.2% under an AM 1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2). A variety of substituents, i.e., methyl, hexyl and triphenylamino groups, were added at the N(10) of phenothiazine in order to optimize the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency. Along the main chromophore a thiophenylene group was inserted at different positions to examine its influence on the properties of devices. The best performance was found in compound NSPt-C6, in which a hexyl group was attached at the N(10) of phenothiazine and a thiophenylene at the C(7) position. It displayed a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 14.42 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.63, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.22%. Their photophysical properties were analyzed with the aid of a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) model with the B3LYP functional. Their photovoltaic behavior was further elucidated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as a promising alternative energy source to solve the crisis of energy as well as environmental issues. The ruthenium-based complexes, i.e., N3, N719, and black dye reported by Michael Grätzel, have achieved maximal power conversion efficiencies over 11%. Compared with metal complexes, organic dyes have the advantages of environmental friendliness, higher structural flexibility, lower cost, easier preparation and purification, etc. The reports on organic dyes are abundant, most of which exhibited energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency in the range of 5–9%. In our previous works we have developed a series of organic dipolar dyes composed of an aromatic amine donor (D) and a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor (A), while the two were separated by a linearly connected triarylene bridge to form a D–π–A system. The performance of DSSCs made with these dyes can achieve a maximal quantum efficiency of 7%, considerably close to that of N719. To explore the possibility of extending to other types of structures, we designed a new group of compounds consisting a phenothiazine as the major bridging unit, onto which a variety of substituents were attached. The structure of phenothiazine possesses some unique features different from that of a typical triarylamine. The two phenyl groups of phenothiazine are arranged nearly coplanar, so that a π-delocalization can be extended over the entire chromophore.

The electron rich nature of a phenothiazine moiety provides a good relay for the electron migration from D to A. In this work, a series of phenothiazine derivatives are prepared, and the DSSCs made with them are examined.
Eight derivatives are designed, i.e., NPt-C1, NPt-C6, NPtS-C6, NSPt-C6, NPt-T, NPtS-T, NSPt-T and Pt-C6 as shown in Fig. 1, where the letters N, Pt, S, C1, C6, and T denote triarylamine, phenothiazine, thiophenyl, methyl, hexyl, and phenylditolylamine moieties, respectively. To each phenothiazine a cyanoacrylic acid group was attached at the C(3) position as an electron acceptor, and a triarylamine moiety was attached at the C(7) position as an electron donor. The phenothiazine moiety acts as a spacer, although it is not fully π-conjugated in a classical sense. The addition of a thiophene unit in some of the structures extends the range of π-electron delocalization, therefore red-shifts the absorption wavelength and increases the molar absorptivity of the materials. An alkyl chain was linked at the N(10) of phenothiazine to help reducing the leakage of dark current, which usually appears while the surface of TiO2 is not completely shielded from the I−/I3− electrolyte. The same effect may be achieved by substituting the nitrogen atom with another triphenylamine group, such as the structures of NPt-T, NPtS-T, and NSPt-T. According to a few recent reports by Tian et al., inserting an extra arylamine group can stabilize the charge separated state and therefore enhance the value of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc). It is therefore anticipated that the Voc values of the T-series compounds can be improved.

All reactions and manipulations were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were distilled freshly according to standard procedures. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker (AV 400/AV 500 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3, and DMSO-d6 as a solvent. Chemical shifts are reported in the δ scale downfield from the peak for tetramethylsilane. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Jasco-550 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were obtained from a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter. The emission spectra in solutions were measured in spectral grade solvent by a 90° angle detection. The redox potentials were measured by using cyclic voltammetry on a CHI 620 analyzer. All measurements were carried out in THF solutions containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte under ambient conditions after purging for 10 minutes with N2. The conventional three electrode configuration was employed, which consists of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal reference. Mass spectra were recorded on a VG70-250S mass spectrometer.

The chemicals, i.e., phenothiazine, iodomethane, 1-bromohexane, butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane), trans-dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (PdCl2(PPh3)2), N,N-dimethylformamide, palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene (dppf), phosphoryl chloride (POCl3), cyanoacetic acid, ammonium acetate, and acetic acid, were purchased from ACROS, Alfa, Merck, Lancaster, TCI, Showa, and Sigma-Aldrich, separately. Chromatographic separations were carried out by using silica gel from Merck, Kieselgel si 60 (40–63 μm). Synthetic procedures for compounds 1-X, 2-X, and Pt-C6 are shown in the ESI.

The FTO conducting glass (FTO glass, fluorine doped tin oxide over-layer, transmission > 90% in the visible, sheet resistance 8 Ω square−1), titania-oxide pastes of Ti-nanoxide T/SP and Ti-nanoxide R/SP were purchased from Solaronix. A thin film of TiO2 (16–18 μm) was coated on a 0.25 cm2 FTO glass substrate. It was immersed in a THF solution containing 3 × 10−4 M dye sensitizers for at least 12 h, then rinsed with anhydrous acetonitrile and dried. Another piece of FTO with sputtering 100 nm thick Pt was used as a counter electrode. The active area was controlled at a dimension of 0.25 cm2 by adhering 60 μm thick polyester tape on the Pt electrode. The photocathode was placed on top of the counter electrode and was tightly clipped together to form a cell. Electrolyte was then injected into the seam between two electrodes. An acetonitrile solution containing LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) was used as the electrolyte. Devices made of a commercial dye N719 under the same condition (3 × 10−4 M, Solaronix S.A., Switzerland) was used as a reference. The cell parameters were obtained under an incident light with intensity 100 mW cm−2 measured by a thermopile probe (Oriel 71964), which was generated by a 300 W Oriel Class A Solar Simulator 91160A-1000 (Newport) passing through a AM 1.5 filter (Oriel 74110). The light intensity was further calibrated by an Oriel reference solar cell (Oriel 91150) and adjusted to be 1.0 sun. The monochromatic quantum efficiency was recorded through a monochromator (Oriel 74100) under short circuit conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectra of DSSCs were recorded by an Impedance/Gain-Phase analyzer (SI 1260, Solartron).

The structure of dyes was optimized by using the B3LYP/6-31G* hybrid functional. For the excited states, a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the B3LYP functional was employed. All analyses were performed using Q-Chem 3.0 software. The frontier orbital plots of HOMO and LUMO were drawn by using Gaussian 03.


The synthetic sequence of eight dyes, i.e., NPt-C1, NPt-C6, NPtS-C6, NSPt-C6, NPt-T, NPtS-T, NSPt-T, and Pt-C6 is shown in Scheme 1 (also Scheme S1 in the ESI). The key intermediates in all syntheses were 7-bromopheno derivatives, i.e., compounds 1-X and 2-X. N-substituted 7-bromophenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde (1-X) was prepared from 10H-phenothiazine by a sequence of N-alkylation, bromination, followed by formylation to give a total yield of 31–55%. The presence of an aldehyde group was verified by an absorption at δ 9.7–9.8 ppm in 1H NMR. Compound 3-X was made from p-(tributylstannyl)phenylnaphthylphenylamine and 1-X by a Stille coupling reaction catalyzed by PdCl2(PPh3)2. The same procedure was used for the preparation of 4-X from a reaction of 1-X and p-(5-(tributylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)phenylnaphthylphenylamine, as well as the preparation of 5-X from p-(tributylstannyl)phenylnaphthylphenylamine and 2-X. The final step was a Knoevenagel condensation between carbaldehyde and cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate. The synthesis of Pt-C6 followed a standard procedure in a previous report, and is described in the ESI. The structures of all new compounds were characterized by their spectroscopic data.


The UV-Vis absorption spectra of organic dyes in THF solution are displayed in Fig. 2 and the parameters are listed in Table 1. Each of these compounds exhibited two major absorption bands at 313–334 nm and 437–480 nm, along with a minor one at 381–384 nm. The two shorter wavelength bands were assigned to the localized aromatic π–π* transitions, and the long wavelength one to a charge-transfer (CT) transition. The intensity of π–π* transitions is higher than that of the charge-transfer transitions (Fig. 2). The compound with a long alkyl chain or a triphenylamine (TPA) substituent on the nitrogen atom of phenothiazine displayed a red-shift with an increased absorptivity, i.e., 1.82 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for NPt-C6 (453 nm) and 1.78 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for NPt-T (474 nm) compared to 1.71 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for NPt-C1 (437 nm). It is known that a wider absorption range is favorable to the performance of DSSCs, as more photons can be harvested. Compounds with a thiophene group, i.e., NSPt-C6 and NSPt-T, also displayed a more extended absorption than those without.

The absorption spectra of all dyes absorbed on the surface of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3. The film absorption band displayed a blue-shift with respect to those in solutions. It appears to be a common phenomenon for such types of most organic dyes, which has been ascribed to the deprotonation of carboxylic acid, as well as to the formation of H-aggregation on the semiconductor surface. In particular, larger blue-shifts are observed in the spectra of NPt-C1 (31 nm) and Pt-C6 (46 nm) compared with others (3–15 nm). The reason can be explained by the compact geometry of Pt-C6 or the absence of a large substituent on the nitrogen atom of NPt-C1 that enables the molecules to pack together more easily on the surface of TiO2.

The oxidation potentials (Eox), corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of dyes, were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in THF solutions (Fig. 4), and the results are listed in Table 1. Each compound displayed two major semi-reversible waves: the lower voltage one is derived from the oxidation of the triarylamine donor and the higher one from the phenothiazine moiety. The introduction of an electron-donating substituent on the phenothiazine π-bridge elevated the HOMO level, thus decreasing the oxidation potential. The ionization energy decreased gradually in the order of Pt-C6 (0.73) > NPt-C1 (0.67) ≈ NSPt-C6 (0.67) ≈ NSPt-T (0.67) > NPt-C6 (0.65) > NPt-T (0.63) > NPtS-C6 (0.55) > NPtS-T (0.52). It is noteworthy that inserting a thiophene unit close to the acceptor group promotes the HOMO level, such as NPtS-C6 and NPtS-T. Suitable HOMO and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels are necessary to match the conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE) of the TiO2 electrode and the redox potential (0.4 V vs. NHE) of the iodine/iodide electrolyte. The estimated HOMO levels were within the range of 0.73–0.52 eV, sufficiently lower than that of the electrolyte pair I−/I3−, thus ensuring a smooth electron flow from the electrolyte to the dyes. The LUMO levels were obtained by the values of Eox and the 0–0 band gaps, which was measured at the onset of absorption spectra in Fig. 2. All levels were considerably higher than the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore the electron injection from the excited state of dyes into the conduction band of TiO2 is also feasible.


The structure of dyes was analyzed by using the B3LYP/6-31G* hybrid functional for full geometrical optimization (Fig. 5). In the ground state the geometry of phenothiazine is not totally planar, but rather slightly bent in the middle forming the shape of a butterfly. The two π-chromophores, i.e., the triarylamine donor and the cyanoacrylate acceptor, are located at different sides of a phenothiazine and are π-conjugated with the two phenyl rings. The side chain attached at N(10) of phenothiazine increases the bulkiness of the molecules, therefore preventing the formation of excimer and/or aggregates. The charge distribution in the frontier molecular orbitals can be depicted in Fig. 6. As shown in the graphs, the HOMO level is localized mostly on the triarylamine (D) moiety, while the LUMO on the cyanoacrylic acid (A). The non-planar shape of the phenothiazine reveals the non-aromatic character of the central heterocycle, which may reduce the degree of electronic resonance between D and A. In the process of photoexcitation, a key issue of increasing the quantum efficiency is to reduce the rate of internal charge recombination. The non-planar geometry between D and A may help to slow down the rate, thus increasing the efficiency of solar cells.

The non-planar geometry of phenothiazine may have a significant influence on the transition probability of photo-excitation. The transition probability was estimated by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the B3LYP functional and the calculated oscillator strength (f) is shown in Table 1. The calculated potential energy levels of HOMOs and LUMOs comply well with the experimental values of EHOMO and ELUMO estimated by CV. The f values of CT transitions are all quite low, ranging 0.14–0.40. The f values of compounds NPt-T, NPtS-T and NSPt-T with a TPA substituent at N(10) show slightly higher f values than others. The results are consistent with the absorptivity measured in solutions.

The parameters of DSSCs fabricated with these dyes, i.e., short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and total power conversion efficiency (η), measured under AM 1.5 solar light (100 mW cm−2) are summarized in Table 2, and the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) plots are shown in Fig. 7. There are two major structural factors worthy of attention: (1) the effect of inserting a thiophenylene group to the major chromophore near the phenothiazine moiety and (2) the influence induced by the substituent at the N(10) of phenothiazine.

The addition of a thiophene in the main chain seems to have exhibited two opposite effects, i.e., it enhanced the DSSC efficiency when the thiophene was located on the side of phenothiazine to the donor group, yet it reduced the DSSC efficiency when it was located on the other side to the acceptor group. The most apparent difference was observed in the Jsc values of NPtS-C6 (5.99) and NSPt-C6 (14.42). In both the C6 and T series compounds, this trend can be clearly identified (Table 2). The difference may be resulted from the relatively low loading amounts of NPtS-C6 and NPtS-T on the TiO2 surface, compared with the corresponding NSPt-C6 and NSPt-T (ESI). A reason for low loading capacity can be explained by examining the shape of a thiophene. A thiophene substituted at 2,5-positions tends to bend the molecule to an angular shape, which makes the whole molecule to occupy a larger surface area than a molecule of linear shape. Such an effect is more pronounced when a thiophene unit is located close to the cyanoacrylate anchoring group, therefore leading to the reduction of loading capacity (ESI, Fig. S32). This kind of influence may be diminished by the addition of a co-absorbent CDCA during film preparation, while the Jsc was recovered to 6.20 mA cm−2 (ESI).
The effect of adding a substituent at the N(10) of phenothiazine seems to be beneficial. The Jsc values of N-hexyl derivatives (C6 series, 13.66–14.42) were better than those of N-TPA derivatives (T series, 11.12–11.65), while both were significantly better than that with a smaller size substituent, i.e., N-methyl compound NPt-C1 (11.12). The higher Jsc values of C6 and T series derivatives consequently led to a better quantum efficiency of DSSCs.
Dyes with long alkyl chain have been known to be capable of reducing dark current by decreasing the rate of charge recombination, and therefore increase the open current voltage (Voc) of the solar cells. The effect was explicitly displayed by the following order of dark current, i.e., NPtS-C6 > NPtS-T > Pt-C6 > NPt-C1 > NPt-C6 > NSPt-C6 > NPt-T ≈ NSPt-T (ESI, Fig. S34). The order of open current voltages matched well with the trend of relative dark current, i.e., NPtS-C6 (0.57) < NPtS-T (0.63) < Pt-C6 (0.65) < NPt-C1 (0.66) < NPt-C6 (0.67) < NSPt-C6 (0.69) < NPt-T ≈ NSPt-T (0.71). The values of fill factor (ff) of all dyes ranged 0.60–0.64, yet did not show much difference among each other. The performances of all dyes, except NPtS-C6 and NPtS-T, are better than that of Pt-C6. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of all dyes displays a broad band in the region of 350–545 nm with values mostly >70 to 80% (Fig. 8). The best performance was observed in the device of NSPt-C6, which exhibited a Jsc value of 14.42 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.69 V, and a ff value of 0.63. The total power conversion efficiency (η) was estimated to be 6.22%. The IPCE was higher than 80% in the wavelength region of 350–510 nm. Compared with recent reports on analogous D–D–π–A systems, this result is superior based on relatively lower loading amounts.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to further elucidate the photovoltaic property. In Fig. 9 the electrochemical impedance spectra are shown for the DSSCs under a forward bias of −0.73 V in the dark. In the Nyquist plots a major semicircle was observed for each dye, which is related to the transport process at the interfaces between TiO2 and the electrolyte/dye. The charge recombination resistance at the TiO2 surface (Rrec) can be deduced by fitting the curves using Z-view software. This value is related to the charge recombination rate, e.g., a smaller Rrec indicates a faster charge recombination and therefore a larger dark current (ESI, Fig. S34). The radius of the semicircles increases in the order NPtS-C6 (43 ohm) < NPtS-T (50) < Pt-C6 (56) < NPt-C1 (71) < NPt-C6 (74) < NSPt-C6 (80) < NPt-T (108) < NSPt-T (112). This trend appears to be consistent with the values of open circuit voltage. The electron lifetime (τ) can also be estimated in a Bode phase graph (ESI, Fig. 33), while a shift to low-frequency corresponds to a longer electron lifetime. The values, which were obtained by fitting the middle-frequency of the Bode phase plot into the equation τ = 1/(2πf), are given in Table 2. A longer electron lifetime corresponds to a larger value of Voc, while the longest electron lifetime was found in NPt-T (5.04 ms).


In this work we have demonstrated the use of phenothiazine derivatives as organic sensitizers for the fabrication of solar cells. These dyes, while they had been absorbed onto the surface of nanocrystalline anatase TiO2, showed remarkable quantum efficiencies in DSSCs. Certain structural features were found to be related to the performance of devices: (i) adding a triarylamine donor moiety at the C(7) position of phenothiazine extends the π-conjugation of the chromophore, therefore enhancing the performance of solar cells. For example, the Jsc value of NPt-C6 (13.66 mA cm−2) is substantially higher than that of Pt-C6 (10.73 mA cm−2). (ii) Compounds containing a hexyl substituent at the N(10) perform better than those possessing a TPA substituent. The latter then perform better than that with a methyl substituent. For example, the trend of quantum efficiency is in the order of NPt-C6 (5.60%) > NPt-T (5.22%) > NPt-C1 (4.60%). (iii) Inserting a thiophene moiety between the phenothiazine and the acceptor group reduces the device efficiency. Yet when a thiophene moiety is inserted in between the phenothiazine and the triarylamine donor group, the quantum efficiency is enhanced. For example, the quantum efficiency of compounds with and without a thiophene moiety is in the order of NSPt-C6 (6.22%) > NPt-C6 (5.60%) > NPtS-C6 (2.40%).

The above phenomena were rationalized by the following factors: (a) the presence of a hexyl or a TPA substituent at the N(10) can improve the film morphology, therefore reducing the dark current and increasing the Voc of the devices and (b) inserting a thiophene between the phenothiazine and the cyanoacrylate anchoring group reduces the loading amount of dyes, as well as the morphology of films. Therefore both the Jsc and Voc values are reduced compared with those without a thiophene moiety.
Considering all the above factors, the best performance of DSSCs can be achieved by using compound NSPt-C6, which possesses a triaryl group at the C(7) position and a hexyl chain at the N(10). It displayed a Jsc value of 14.42 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.69 V, and a ff value of 0.63, leading to an overall quantum efficiency of 6.22%.
