Recently, flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) have attracted extensive attention as an essential element for future organic electronics (OEs), i.e. solution-processable, scalable and flexible organic electronics (FOEs). Although the traditional transparent electrode indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used in OEs, its brittleness and high cost significantly limit its application in the next generation of devices, typically flexible electronics. Thus, many alternatives, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, conductive polymers, metal nanowires, metal grids and electrospun metallic nanofibers, have arisen at the forefront of FTEs. Among them, silver nanowire (AgNW) networks have attracted particular attention due to their excellent electrical conductivity and high transmittance, as well as facile availability and low cost. Since many studies on AgNWs have been published, a comprehensive review highlighting the advantages of AgNWs in FOEs is highly required. In this review, the synthesis and film fabrication of AgNWs have been firstly summarized, focusing especially on the properties of conductivity and light transmittance. Next, post treatments with different approaches to improve the conductivity of AgNWs have been included. And then, characterization of FTEs has been introduced with details on key parameters for FOEs. Furthermore, AgNW-based FOEs have been summarized to demonstrate the recent progress, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), organic memory devices (OMDs), etc. Finally, perspectives for AgNWs in FOEs have been discussed and concluded as well. It is expected that AgNWs could be the focus of future FOEs compared with other alternatives in terms of their advantages of optoelectronic properties, film-formation, solution-processability and flexibility.

Prof. Silva has published over 550 journal papers with 18000 + citations (Google Scholar), and has a Google H-factor of 66. His research interest encompasses a wide range of activities. Nanotechnology and renewables are two underlying themes that thread through a plethora of fields that include solar cells, energy materials, carbon electronics, transistor designs and simulations, OSCs, OLEDs, CNTs, graphene, SGT, CFRP, DLC, nanobiotechnology, nanocarbons, nanotechnology, water technology, large area electronics, and electronic and photonic devices.

Transparent electrodes (TEs) are crucial for various optoelectronic devices including liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), touch screens, smart cards, e-papers, wearable electronics, etc. Currently, the mainstream of TEs relies on the techniques of high vacuum processes, which are considered to be well compatible with the existing silicon-based device fabrication, and the materials of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), including indium tin oxide (ITO), fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO). With the development of the next generation of optoelectronic devices, there is an increased and huge demand for the function of flexibility. As a necessary component, flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) have thus shown potential and fascinating applications in future flexible optoelectronics due to the advantages of flexibility, low-cost, and large-scale manufacturing.


Fig. 1a shows the publications on FTEs from Web of Science during the past few decades. Before 2009, there were very few reports on FTEs, and there has been a significant increase in the number of publications since 2011. A similar publication trend of FTEs in organic electronics (OEs) can also be seen from Fig. 1b. To some extent, Fig. 1 indicates that the development of FTEs is closely related to that of OEs. Nowadays, FTEs are already one of the research focuses in FOEs. However, the development of FOEs still lags far behind that of OEs due to the absence of ideal FTEs, which require excellent electrical conductivity, high transmittance, good mechanical flexibility, long-term stability, etc.
As is well known, ITO has been most widely used as a TE due to its excellent electrical conductivity (∼10 Ω sq−1) and light transmittance (>90% at 550 nm). However, ITO exhibits several critical drawbacks, such as poor mechanical stability, poor chemical stability and high cost. Furthermore, ITO films are generally fabricated by magnetron sputtering, which is not compatible with the mild process of FOEs, especially the potential printing processes in the future. In this case, ITO may not be an appropriate choice for FTEs although there are many reports on ITO grown on flexible substrates. To overcome these limitations, several alternative materials as FTEs have been developed, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), conductive polymers, metal nanowires, metal grids or mesh, and electrospun metallic nanofibers.
Among them, carbon-based materials including graphene and CNTs have shown the characteristics of high transmittance and excellent flexibility. In addition, carbon-based FTEs can be prepared by a solution process, which allows for high speed, low cost and roll-to-roll techniques. However, carbon-based materials are generally limited by low conductivity (CNTs: 100–1000 Ω sq−1 and graphene: 100–10000 Ω sq−1) and lack of uniformity in large-scale films.
Conducting polymers have been used as electrodes to improve the optical, mechanical and ambient stability; furthermore, polymer-based electrodes can realize full flexibility, which is one of the key issues that FTEs should make a breakthrough in to push the development of future flexible devices. However, the relatively low conductivity of conducting polymers has still been the main problem.
In recent years, metallic nanowires with a one-dimension structure have attracted more and more attention due to their high transparency (>80%), excellent conductivity (10–100 Ω sq−1) and considerable mechanical stability. Furthermore, metallic nanowires, with a high aspect ratio (diameter in the nanoscale and no limitation in length), can be solution processed to reduce the production cost and simplify the fabrication process. Among the reported various metallic nanowires, silver nanowires (AgNWs) have attracted particular attention due to their superior electrical conductivity and high transmittance compared with other metallic NWs, such as AuNWs and CuNWs. As indicated in Fig. 2, AgNWs exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with low sheet resistance and high transmittance at 550 nm. As one of the best potential replacements of ITO, AgNWs are considered to be the most promising FTEs in the future FOEs.
In order to evaluate the properties of different TEs, the figure of merit (FOM) has been introduced to characterize the relationship between light transmittance and sheet resistance. One is defined by the ratio of direct-current (DC) conductivity to optical conductivity, σDC/σOP(λ).
(1)
In this case,

(2)
where
σOP(λ), σDC, Rsh, and T(λ) are the optical conductivity, DC conductivity, sheet resistance and optical transmittance (λ = 550 nm) of the electrode, respectively. The higher the σDC/σOP(λ), the better the TEs. It is generally agreed that TEs need to have σDC/σOP of at least 35 for use in practical devices, which corresponds to an Rsh < 100 Ω sq−1 with a T > 90%.

Another FOM expression ϕTC is determined by Haacke:
(3)
where
T and Rsh are the optical transmittance (λ =550 nm) and the sheet resistance. In this case, the higher the ϕTC, the better the TEs.

The FOM expression σDC/σOP(λ) is more widely used to compare the properties of different TEs, although ϕTC has also been used. Here we give a full comparison of FOM values in Fig. 3 (a) σDC/σOP(λ) and (b) ϕTC according to the above two FOM expressions for typical TEs, including ITO, PEDOT:PSS, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), CuNWs, and AgNWs.Table 1 lists the key parameters for different TEs for reference. From Fig. 3, it is easy to find that both FOM expressions can give a similar evaluation on the properties of TEs, and they show nearly the same trend of FOM versus sheet resistance. However, it should be indicated that for the transmittance it is better to use the same or a similar value for a reliable comparison between the two FOM expressions.

From Fig. 3 and Table 1, if we use ITO as the benchmark, TEs such as graphene, CNTs, PEDOT:PSS and CuNWs generally show a relatively lower FOM. Although solution-sheared PEDOT:PSS has been recently reported to show excellent electrical conductivity and high transmittance over 96%, it still can’t compete with ITO. On the other hand, TEs based on Ag nanostructures, such as AgNWs, mesh or Ag grids, demonstrate much lower sheet resistance and higher FOM values. Recent attempts using Ag nanotroughs have resulted in superior optoelectronic properties with a sheet resistance of 2 Ω sq−1 at 90% transmittance, and the related σDC/σOP(λ) and ϕTC values are 1742.4 and 17.43 × 10−2 respectively. In addition, Ag nanorings are reported to be the next generation transparent conductive films with a better transmittance and lower haze compared with AgNWs. Although various Ag nanostructures have been developed, AgNWs probably have the most potential to be an alternative for ITO. Furthermore, AgNWs are known to exhibit excellent mechanical stability due to the network structure which may provide an advantageous geometry and limit the dislocation activity in a nanoscale volume. In this case, the combination of AgNWs and OEs may promise potential FOEs in the near future.
Although AgNWs have shown excellent properties as FTEs, there are still several key issues which should be addressed in the near future. For example, in order to further improve the light transmittance of FTEs based on AgNWs, one feasible way is to reduce the film thickness, but as a result, the conductivity will be reduced as well. To fix the problem, hybrid electrodes which combine more than two materials such as graphene and AgNWs have been reported recently, achieving both excellent conductivity and high transmittance. The second issue of AgNWs is the relatively poor thermal and ambient stability. The AgNW film may become unstable under thermal treatment even at temperatures much lower than the melting point (962 °C) of bulk Ag, as the surface diffusion of Ag atoms can be accelerated due to its high surface-to-volume ratio. In addition, Ag nanowires can be easily oxidized when exposed to a humid environment for a long time, which thus causes significant degradation in their electrical conductivity. It has been reported that buried AgNWs in metal oxides or a transparent polymer can improve the thermal, chemical and ambient stability by getting rid of the exposure to the environment.
In view of the promising and potential applications of AgNWs, we will discuss the recent progress in AgNW-based FOEs. Firstly, we will give a brief introduction on various methods of AgNW synthesis and film fabrication. Next, post treatments with different approaches to improve the conductivity of AgNWs are provided. And then, the characterization of FTEs is introduced with details on key parameters for FOE devices. Finally, we will review the existing results of FOE devices to demonstrate the recent progress, and we present conclusions and perspectives for future efforts on AgNWs in FOEs.

Due to the fascinating properties and potential applications of AgNWs, various methods for the synthesis of AgNWs have been proposed, which are originally derived from the strategy to prepare metal nanoparticles (NPs). At the early stages, AgNWs were mainly prepared via electrochemical methods with low yield and non-uniform size. Later on, other methods including photochemical reduction, hydrothermal methods, and template techniques were developed. Among them, template techniques, including hard-template and soft-template techniques, are most popular as AgNWs were provided with uniform size and morphology and high yield.


Photochemical reduction can be performed at room temperature for the synthesis of AgNWs. Cheap chemical reagents, a green chemical process and a local reduction approach are the main merits of photochemical reduction. In the case of photochemical reduction, light irradiation, such as ultraviolet and laser irradiation, has been used to produce hydration electrons and reduce radicals, that is, Ag is reduced in the solution, and correspondingly AgNWs are formed in the rod micelles composed of the surfactant molecules or templates. To some extent, photochemical reduction can be merged with template techniques when various templates are used in the system.

AgNWs with very small diameters (below 7 nm) and lengths of more than a micrometer have been synthesized in solution using photochemically active templates, i.e. supramolecular nanotubes formed through J-aggregation of an amphiphilic cyanine dye. The template allows photoinitiation of nanowire growth, defines the diameter, and provides solubility. Moreover, it provides the potential for controlled synthesis of AgNWs under specific conditions, typically, by selectively exciting the inner or outer wall of the nanotubular template, as their optical properties are different.
A method for rapidly fabricating dense and high-aspect-ratio AgNWs, with a diameter of 200 nm and a length of more than 30 μm, has been reported. The fabrication process simply involves filling the Ag nitrate solution into the pores of an anodic-aluminum-oxide (AAO) membrane through capillary attraction and irradiating the dried template AAO membrane with a pulsed ArF excimer laser. All fabrication processes can be executed in an ambient environment and at room temperature, and this method demonstrates potential as an alternative for growing patterned Ag nanostructures on a flexible substrate.
Hong et al. reported a simple electro-/photochemical redox reaction for the synthesis of AgNWs inside the pores of self-assembled calix[4]hydroquinone (CHQ) nanotubes in an ambient aqueous phase. The self-assembled organic nanotube arrays were firstly formed in the aqueous phase by CHQ, which is an electrochemically active calixarene derivative with four hydroquinone (HQ) subunits. Then the CHQ nanotubes were soaked in 1 M AgNO3 aqueous solution for a few minutes followed by ultraviolet irradiation for 30 s to accelerate the redox process. The resulting products were filtered and washed with distilled water. All the processes were carried out in the solution phase at standard temperature and pressure, whereas most of the previous methods involved extreme conditions such as high temperature, high pressure, or high vacuum.
Besides the application of templates, AgNWs have also been fabricated by an ultraviolet (UV) irradiation technique without any templates in the presence of phosphomolybdic acid (PMo) acting as a catalyst and stabilizing agent. In this case, the morphology of AgNWs was found to be closely related to the initial concentrations of reactants, AgNO3:PMo ratios, UV irradiation time, and temperature. In this case, well-defined Ag nanowires can be obtained when the concentration of AgNO3 is between 0.25 and 0.5 mmol L−1, and the AgNO3:PMo ratio ranged from 0.5 to 2. Additionally, low temperature and short irradiation time are beneficial to the formation of AgNWs.

Hydrothermal synthesis refers to the use of water as the reaction and recrystallization medium resulting in the formation of AgNWs with a uniform structure and promising yield, and in the absence of organic solvents and toxic reagents. The hydrothermal reaction is mostly carried out at temperature between 100 and 1000 °C and pressure between 1 MPa and 1 GPa. With the advantages of a facile process, good crystal shape and easy control of particle size, hydrothermal synthesis is considered to be a promising method for AgNW preparation.

Wang et al. successfully synthesized AgNWs with a diameter of around 100 nm and a length of up to 500 μm in a large scale via a simple hydrothermal process without using any surfactants or polymers. Although a small quantity of NPs coexisted, the as-prepared AgNWs exhibited very narrow diameter distribution (Fig. 4). As no organic solvents or toxic reagents were used, the synthetic strategy demonstrates a simple and environment-friendly method to grow other nanowires. The reaction is realized by reducing freshly prepared silver chloride (AgCl) with glucose at 180 °C for 18 hours, which is shown in eqn (4):
CH2OH–(CHOH)4–CHO + 2AgCl + H2O → CH2OH–(CHOH)4–COOH + 2Ag + 2HCl
(4)
Xu et al. synthesized AgNWs from silver nitrate (AgNO3) in an aqueous solution of gemini surfactant 1,3-bis(cetyldimethylammonium) propane dibromide at a relatively low temperature. In this system, methenamine acts as a reducing agent, and the gemini surfactant is used as an assistant agent. AgNWs can be formed gradually with the help of the gemini surfactant by which a slow reaction rate is favorable for the anisotropic growth of AgNWs. The reaction process can be formulated as shown in the following equations:
Ag+ + Br− → AgBr
(5)
C6H12N4 + 6H2O  6HCHO + 4NH3
(6)
AgBr + 2NH3  [Ag(NH3)2]+ + Br−
(7)
HCHO + 2[Ag(NH3)2]+ + H2O → HCOO− + 2Ag + 3NH4+ + NH3
(8)

The template technique can avoid the disadvantages of electrochemical methods, and AgNWs synthesized by this method are uniform with a relatively high yield. The template method can be divided into hard-template and soft-template methods based on the nature of the template. In general, the hard template method is more controllable, but the purification is complicated. In contrast, the purification in the soft process is very convenient, but it is difficult to control the morphology of products.

In the past decade, the template technique has been modified by many researchers, and more simple and efficient methods have been developed, among which the polyol method is a prominent example of the soft-template technique, and has been widely used.

Porous solid materials such as nanoporous membranes, anodic aluminum oxide, mesoporous oxides, CNTs and DNA have been used as hard templates. Since AgNWs can be grown within the nanopores of the membrane or the channel of CNTs, the diameter of AgNWs can be rationally controlled by tuning the size of the nanopores and the tubes.

Martin et al. firstly used nanoporous membranes as hard templates to prepare metals, semiconductors and other materials in the nanoscale. Porous alumina, nanochannel glasses, mesoporous silica and porous polycarbonate were extensively investigated for the preparation of metal nanostructures. By using these hard templates, the nanostructures can be generated within the nanopores by either the electrochemical or chemical reduction of metal ions. The advantage of hard templates is that the resultant AgNWs are highly ordered and with well-defined morphologies. However, complex procedures are required for the subsequent removal of these templates, which may damage the nanowires, especially those with high aspect ratios.
Mesoporous silica has been used as a hard template for the preparation of AgNWs in the tubular pores. Isolated nanowires can be easily obtained by treating the mesoporous silicates with HF. However, the smaller pore size results in the incomplete filling of template pores by vapor-phase epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition, and photochemical deposition.
CNTs provide an ideal host matrix for AgNWs, as was first demonstrated by Ajayan et al. They filled CNTs with molten lead and thus utilized these materials as templates for the fabrication of nanowires. Subsequently, Ugarte and coworkers developed a new approach to fill CNTs with AgNO3. The AgNO3 was subsequently converted to metallic Ag and thus AgNWs via irradiation with an electron beam produced by an electron microscope. This process was attributed to thermolysis, where the AgNO3 underwent the following reaction:
2AgNO3 → 2Ag + 2NO2 + O2
(9)
In addition, DNA has been recognized as a useful building material in the field of nanotechnology, due partially to its ability to participate in supramolecular interactions and its unique structure. Braun et al. were the first to construct AgNWs by using DNA as a template. A key feature facilitating this protocol is the attractive interactions between the DNA template and Ag cations, the latter of which can be subsequently reduced in the presence of the template with a reducing agent or via photoreduction to yield the desired AgNWs. As in the case with other hard template methods, the subsequent removal of these templates is problematic, and the yield of AgNWs is very low. In general, hard template methods are not scalable, which limits their industrial applicability.

Considering the drawbacks of the hard template method, scientists have also focused on strategies that rely on soft templates, such as various surfactants, micelles and polymers. A key feature of these soft templates is that they can be easily dissolved or well dispersed in the solvent employed for the synthesis of AgNWs, and thus the soft template method can be conducted in the solution phase, with great potential for scalable production and application in industry.

Surfactants were first chosen as soft templates for the synthesis of AgNWs. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) has been extensively studied in the last decade, and it was first used as a capping agent in the synthesis of other inorganic nanorods and nanowires. This strategy can also be employed for the fabrication of Ag nanorods and nanowires, that is, Ag nanorods and nanowires were successfully synthesized by using rod-shaped micelles of CTAB as templates. Murphy et al. noted that rod-like micelles, microemulsions, and surfactants in solution had been used to direct the growth of anisotropic nanomaterials. These methods are usually conducted in water, with ascorbic acid or NaBH4 used as a reductant. The surfactants, micelles or polymers are chemically absorbed onto the growing crystals and kinetically control the growth rates through their adsorption and desorption from the crystal surface. The capping agent along with nanospherical side-products can be isolated from the targeted AgNWs via centrifugation. Fig. 5 illustrates the example of TEM images of Ag nanorods and AgNWs synthesized by the soft template method. Ag nanorods have a uniform length of 42 ± 3 nm and an aspect ratio of 3.5, and AgNWs are 1–4 μm in length with an aspect ratio of 50–350. Other soluble polymers have also been used as capping agents or soft templates. For example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and hydrophilic block copolymers have been used as soft templates for the synthesis of AgNWs. However, the products synthesized by these soft template methods are frequently plagued by low yields, irregular morphologies, polycrystallinity, and low aspect ratios, which may limit their applications in a large scale.

The polyol method has been the most successful route for the preparation of high quality AgNWs in a large scale. In this method, ethylene glycol (EG) and AgNO3 are generally used as the polyol and Ag source respectively. In addition, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) is used both as a capping agent and a dispersant to prevent the aggregation of Ag NPs, which thus can control the growth rate of AgNWs in the solution. In many cases, the nucleating agents are used as well. The basic principle of the polyol method is that polyols reduce Ag ions to Ag atoms which gradually grow to form nanoscale Ag in the solution. It is worth mentioning that the polyol method is usually used along with the above-mentioned methods.

In fact, the polyol process was developed by Fievet et al. for the preparation of monodisperse metal powders in micrometer and sub-micrometer sizes at the earliest stage. And it was extended to the synthesis of AgNWs by Xia et al. by employing ethylene glycol as the polyol, which fulfilled a dual role as both a reducing agent and a solvent. At the beginning, they used Pt NPs, which were synthesized via the reduction of PtCl2 with ethylene glycol as seeds, and the reduction of Ag salts was performed in the second step. The advantage of this method is that both the steps were realized under similar conditions. In the solution, Pt seeds became separated as the Ag underwent subsequent nucleation and growth steps, while PVP promoted the anisotropic growth by selectively binding to certain facets of the growing crystal. Both Pt seeds and PVP played critical roles in the formation of AgNWs. However, the expensive Pt and the complex two-step approach limited the commercial viability.
Later, they developed a self-seeding process which did not require external seeds. In this case, the molecular weight of PVP and the PVP:AgNO3 molar ratio had an important effect on the preparation of uniform AgNWs. Therefore, the injection rate of AgNO3 should be precisely controlled for the production of uniform AgNWs, which makes it difficult for large scale synthesis.
Inspired by the idea of the importance of the balance of reduced Pt(0) and oxidized Pt(II) to prepare Pt nanowires by use of FeCl3 as the etchant, Xia et al. applied FeCl3 in the synthesis of AgNWs, and they found that the presence of Fe(III) helped to remove oxygen atoms from the surfaces of Ag NPs, and thus protected them against oxidative etching. The results showed that FeCl3 can effectively facilitate the growth of AgNWs.
Furthermore, Xia et al. used copper salts as the etchant, and found that the introduction of either CuCl or CuCl2 in the polyol reduction of AgNO3 in the presence of PVP greatly facilitated the growth of AgNWs, which is quite similar to that observed in the presence of FeCl3. Fig. 6 gives the schematic illustration depicting the role of copper salts in the polyol process for the synthesis of AgNWs. In this method, both the Cu(I) cation and chloride anion are necessary for the growth of AgNWs. Cu(I) ions served to scavenge adsorbed atomic oxygen from the surface of Ag seeds. Cl− can not only stabilize the initially formed Ag seeds by electrostatic interactions, but can also reduce the concentration of free Ag+ ions and subsequently Ag seeds in the solution through the formation of poorly soluble AgCl nanocrystallites. Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of AgNWs prepared by the polyol reduction of AgNO3 in the presence of CuCl2 and PVP. Due to the absence of a syringe pump, it could provide a viable strategy for the large scale fabrication of AgNWs.
Based on the application of oxygen scavengers in the polyol process, a standard procedure for the preparation of AgNWs has been gradually modified and developed, and it has been extensively investigated by most researchers. For this procedure, ethylene glycol was preheated for 1 h before adding NaCl, metal salts, PVP and AgNO3 in sequence. This method has been scaled up by a factor of ten for the production of nanowires over a range of different sizes, without adding any reagents through a syringe pump. For example, AgNWs with a length of 100 μm and a diameter of 100 nm were obtained through this method, as well as AgNWs with a much smaller size, typically with a length of 10 μm and a diameter of 40 nm.
Despite considerable progress in the synthesis of AgNWs, it still remains a challenging task to produce high-aspect-ratio AgNWs via a facile and rapid process. In general, high-aspect-ratio AgNWs are desirable for the fabrication of FTEs with excellent electrical conductivity, high optical transmittance and good flexibility, as they can form a percolation network with a relatively lower density and less junctions. Therefore, it is very important to develop effective strategies to synthesize high-aspect-ratio AgNWs.

A variety of solution-processing methods, such as spin coating, drop casting, spray deposition, doctor blade coating and roll-to-roll, have been employed to fabricate AgNW based FTEs due to their advantages of moderate temperature, environment-friendliness, low energy consumption and cost. Furthermore, the solution-processing techniques can proceed on arbitrary surfaces and large-size substrates, which may promise flexible and large-area applications in the future.


Spin coating is probably the most common solution-processing method in the formation of FTEs based on AgNWs. The process of spin coating can be described as follows: the droplets of conductive ink are deposited on a flat substrate sucked by vacuum, and then the dispersion is evenly spread into a film under centrifugal force by high speed rotation. The film thickness thus can be adjusted by varying the spin rate and the concentration of AgNWs. In general, an annealing process is applied after the spin coating to improve the film quality, resulting in better performance with lower sheet resistance and higher light transmittance. Kou et al. deposited AgNWs with a length of 15 μm and a diameter of 60 nm on polyethylene by spin coating, and then used sunlight illumination to improve the electrical conductivity. As a result, AgNW-based FTEs with a sheet resistance of <20 Ω sq−1 and a light transmittance of ∼87% were obtained. In addition, the facile process of spin coating is convenient for quickly checking a sample in a laboratory setting, but is obviously not appropriate for large scale processing.


Drop casting involves dropping and drying a volume of AgNW dispersion on a substrate that is agitated on a shaker. Although the resulting nanowire mesh can be randomly dispersed in the center of the droplet, a coffee ring consisting of denser nanowires is often formed around the edge of the droplet, leading to a rough surface. More uniform nanowire films can be formed on a filter membrane using vacuum filtration. This film can then be transferred to various substrates including glass, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Basically, the film thickness depends on the volume of the dispersion and the material concentration. This method is particularly good for producing films with a known area fraction of nanowires. For example, Tokuno et al. prepared a Ag nanowire network on glass and PET substrates by drop casting a known amount of AgNW (8 mm length and 80 nm diameter) suspension. Either annealing at 200 °C or mechanical pressing at 25 MPa was carried out as a means of post-treatment. Compared to annealing, mechanical pressing provided similar sheet resistance (8.6 Ω sq−1) and light transmittance (80%). Besides, pressed samples exhibited less surface roughness than the thermally annealed ones, which is a critical factor affecting the electrode performance. In addition, mechanical pressing was also reported to be a unique approach for heat sensitive polymer substrates. However, drop casting is not scalable, and it is challenging to completely transfer the nanowires from the filter to substrate.


Random networks of AgNWs can also be sprayed from dilute suspensions using an airbrush or electrostatic sprayer. Spray coating depends on passing compressed air through a nozzle, which converts the solution into very fine droplets and sprays them onto a surface (Fig. 8a). There are various process parameters to be controlled such as the scan speed, flow rate, spraying pressure, spraying distance and substrate temperature. This method sometimes requires the substrate to be heated to evaporate the solvent, especially when the solvent is water. The spray pressure can be adjusted to produce small droplets to improve the film uniformity. Song et al. fabricated AgNWs on a PET substrate through spray coating, which provided a sheet resistance of 50 Ω sq−1 with a light transmittance of 90% by simply optimizing the spraying parameters. Spraying pressure was found to be the most critical parameter, which controlled the size of droplets and thus the uniformity of the networks. Yang et al. prepared Ag nanowire electrodes on glass and PET substrates for the purpose of flexible polymer solar cells. The nanowires used for the electrode were about 60 nm in diameter and 20 mm in length. The conducting film was pressed with 1000 psi pressure at RT for 10 s after spraying the nanowire solution (spray rate of 0.05–0.09 mL s−1) on the substrate held on a heated pad (100 °C). The electrode demonstrated a sheet resistance of 33.2 Ω sq−1 and 30.8 Ω sq−1 on glass and PET substrates, respectively. Both conducting films (either on glass or on PET) exhibited a light transmittance of 80%. Spray coating is particularly well-suited for applying nanowires to curved and irregularly shaped surfaces.


Doctor blade is one of the widely used techniques for producing thin films on large area surfaces in terms of cost and simplicity. Briefly, the ink is put in front of the fixed blade which forces the ink to spread on the moving substrate (Fig. 8b). The final thickness is determined by the distance between the blade and the substrate. It gives precise and very good quality thin film coating. Hwang et al. used a simple and cost-effective doctor blade method to prepare AgNW (a length of 25 μm and a diameter of 30 nm) films on glass and PET substrates. The blade was fixed at a height of 30 μm above the glass and PET, and the speed of the blade movement was 10 mm s−1. Then the Al2O3 layer was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The resulting electrode exhibited low sheet resistance, high transmittance, excellent mechanical stability, superior thermal stability and good ambient stability. Furthermore, both electron and hole collecting electrodes were fabricated via doctor blade coating of AgNWs with the best results of 9 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance and 90% transmittance. The doctor blade coating can operate at a speed of up to several meters per minute and it is suitable to coat a substrate with a very wide range of wet films with thicknesses ranging from 20 to several hundred microns.


Meyer rod coating is a simple and scalable method to fabricate FTEs from AgNWs, and it is suitable for the roll-to-roll process. The basic principle is to disperse a solution of conductive inks onto a substrate, and then use a Meyer bar to spread the solution into a film (Fig. 8c). Meyer rod coating can control the film performance by changing the line diameter and distance of the Meyer rod. It has been widely used for preparing transparent conductive films due to high accuracy, good uniformity and low cost. Lee et al. designed a TE based on a dual-scale AgNW percolation network embedded in a flexible substrate, which demonstrated a significant improvement in the conductivity by filling the large percolative voids in a long/thick AgNW network with short/thin AgNWs. The dual-scale electrodes were fabricated on a heated glass substrate by Meyer rod coating and then transferred to a flexible substrate. The electrode exhibited a sheet resistance less than 50 Ω sq−1 and a light transmittance of 90% at 550 nm. Furthermore, OLEDs based on the dual-scale AgNWs showed much better performance than those on single scaled AgNWs. Moreover, oxidation and mechanical stability were increased by using the dual-scale AgNWs. Compared with the above described spray and doctor blade coating, Meyer rod coating is more scalable as it enables faster deposition of nanowires to the film.


Roll-to-roll slot die coating is one of the many methods that can be used to deposit a thin liquid film onto the surface of a substrate. Unlike traditional coating techniques, this method can be easily integrated into scale-up processes. The technique itself offers high levels of coating uniformity across the length/width of the coating surface, and can also deposit thin-films with thicknesses ranging from a few nanometers to many microns. Roll-to-roll slot die coating has been reported to create highly transparent conducting films consisting of AgNWs on plastic substrates. A conceptual schematic of the production process is shown in Fig. 9. An aqueous dispersion of AgNWs is coated and dried on a PET substrate, followed by a thin, transparent, UV-curable polymer overcoat. The purpose of the overcoat layer is to impart mechanical strength to the coating and protect the nanowire layer from direct environmental exposure. All processing steps can be performed at low temperatures (<120 °C) and are thus compatible with most types of optical grade plastic film such as PET, polycarbonate, or cellulose. The wet-film thickness, and thus the conductivity and transmittance, can be tuned by adjusting the roll-to-roll coating parameters or the concentration of the nanowire ink without compromising the coating throughout. Recently, Kim et al. reported the fabrication of large-area (400 mm wide) AgNW films by use of a continuous roll-to-roll slot die coater. By optimizing the flow rate of the shear-thinning AgNW ink in the slot die, AgNW percolating network films were obtained with a sheet resistance of 50 Ω sq−1, a light transmittance of 90% and a haze of 0.5–1%, and they showed much better mechanical flexibility than the conventional ITO films. The successful application of the slot-die-coated large-area AgNW films demonstrated their great potential for cost-effective and large-area flexible touch screen panels.


As is well known, the majority of the sheet resistance of the Ag nanowire network arises from the contact resistance between nanowires, and it is necessary to minimize the contact resistance in order to reduce the sheet resistance of the nanowire network. To reduce the contact resistance between nanowires, various approaches have been developed, such as thermal annealing, mechanical pressing or light-induced plasmonic nanowelding.


As one of the simple, efficient and feasible approaches, thermal annealing has been widely employed. D. P. Langley et al. systematically investigated the effects of thermal annealing on the electrical conductivity of AgNWs. According to the dependence of resistance on the annealing temperature and the corresponding SEM images in Fig. 10, four physical mechanisms have been proposed for the origin of this resistance variation with temperature: desorption of organic residues, desorption/degradation of PVP, local sintering and Rayleigh instability of AgNWs. Higher temperatures accelerate the annealing process, but result in equal conductivity values. However, if the annealing duration is too long, the nanowire network is destabilized and the resistance increases due to more and more network interruptions. In this case, there are optimal parameters for annealing temperature and duration. The optimization of annealing parameters led to specimens with a transmittance of 90% (at 550 nm) and a sheet resistance of 9.5 Ω sq−1. In addition, the optimized annealing temperature depends on the nanowire diameter due to the Rayleigh instability, which should be underlined as AgNWs with a small diameter and a large aspect ratio are often preferred as TEs.

In general, thermal annealing at about or even more than 200 °C is needed to realize well connected junctions between AgNWs. However, such a heating process is one of the drawbacks for AgNW electrodes on heat-sensitive substrates. Weiß et al. reduced the annealing temperature by well controlling the humidity, and found that the absorption of moisture by PVP led to a dramatic decrease in the glass transition temperature, thus resulting in softening effects. In this case, the sheet resistance of the as-prepared AgNW films, which were 90 nm thick after annealing at 60 °C or 35 nm thick after annealing at 45 °C, was equal to that of the film annealed at 140–250 °C without controlling humidity. This humidity assisted low temperature approach is especially advantageous for OEs and for fabricating devices on thermally sensitive transparent flexible foils.

The sheet resistance of AgNW electrodes can also be improved by mechanical pressing. With mechanical pressing, the annealing temperature can be significantly reduced, and the dual-treatment has been found to efficiently improve the conductivity of AgNW networks. Tokuno et al. demonstrated that mechanical pressing at 25 MPa for 5 s at RT resulted in a low sheet resistance of 8.6 Ω sq−1 and a light transmittance of 80.0%, equivalent to those of the samples annealed at 200 °C (Fig. 11), which made it possible to fabricate nanowire-based TEs on heat-sensitive substrates. Hu et al. found that the sheet resistance of the AgNW electrode decreased from hundreds of Ω sq−1 to tens of Ω sq−1 by sandwiching AgNW networks between two rigid substrates and applying 81 GPa pressure for 50 s, and in addition, the surface roughness was decreased from 110 to 47 nm after pressing.


Light-induced plasmonic nanowelding techniques have also been developed to quickly reduce the sheet resistance of AgNWs. Exposure of an AgNW film to a tungsten-halogen lamp at a power density of 30 W cm−2 for 1 minute welds AgNWs together and decreases the resistance of the film by three orders of magnitude as shown in Fig. 12. It is thought that the intensity of the incident electromagnetic field in the nanoscale gaps between AgNWs results in heating only at the point where nanowires need to be joined, preventing damage to the substrate. Other authors have demonstrated that a high intensity pulsed light source, such as 230 W xenon lamps, can reduce the sheet resistance of a film in 50 μs. Such fast processing time may be useful for high-speed roll-to-roll processing.

Recently, Kou et al. demonstrated the improvement of the sheet resistance of AgNW-based FTEs by means of simple sunlight illumination.Fig. 13 shows the sheet resistance and transmittance as a function of treatment time of sunlight illumination or thermal annealing at 200 °C. The sunlight illumination exhibited comparable effects to annealing at 200 °C on the sheet resistance and transmittance of AgNWs. The sheet resistance of AgNWs with sunlight illumination is even lower than that with thermal annealing at 200 °C, and with increasing treatment time, the sheet resistance becomes much lower. For the transmittance, it is more constant during the treatment with sunlight illumination than that during thermal annealing. Since sunlight is easily available, this method is economical and convenient, showing potential outdoor applications.
There are also approaches to reduce the sheet resistance of AgNW networks by the introduction or combination with other materials. Exfoliated clay platelets have been reported to work as a key element to improve the solution and coating properties of AgNW inks, resulting in uniformly interconnected AgNW networks. The introduction of Au nanoparticles into AgNWs by in situ galvanic displacement was demonstrated to improve the conductivity by forming a network of gold-coated AgNWs. However, the additives may affect the morphology of the AgNW film, and thus reduce the light transmittance. The combination of AgNWs with carbon-based materials has been shown to improve both the conductivity and transmittance, which demonstrates great potential in device applications. Dong et al. designed hybrid FTEs with a sandwich structure of graphene/AgNW/polymer. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was firstly used as the bottom substrate to finish the transfer of monolayer graphene, and then the AgNWs were spin-coated on the graphene/PTFE surface. In the next step, the AgNW/graphene/PTFE film was subjected to a pressure of 10 MPa for 10 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 15 min. As a result, the conductivity was greatly improved due to the compact connection of different layers. Finally, the hybrid film was underwent the spin-coating of a mixed polymer and the peeling-off process, which resulted in FTEs with a sheet resistance of 8.06 Ω sq−1 at a light transmittance of 88.3%.

Metal grid electrodes have exhibited low sheet resistance and good light transmittance compared to other TEs. Unlike random metal nanowire networks, controlled network geometries allow engineered spectral transmission by optimizing the trench width. However, considerable surface roughness accompanying metal grid electrodes has been the root cause of electrical short circuit for organic electronics including OLEDs and OSCs. To date, different approaches have been successfully demonstrated for the fabrication of Ag grids, such as thermal evaporation, screen printing, inkjet printing, and nanolithography.

Although Ag grid electrodes have been reported to be fabricated by thermal evaporation, and the sheet resistance can be reduced from hundreds to several Ω □−1 depending on the thickness of Ag grids, the light transmittance was generally less than 70%, and the formation of silver sulfide during the thermal evaporation will degrade the properties of Ag grids.
Ag grids with accurate line patterns of 160 μm width have been realized with a sheet resistance of 1 Ω □−1 by screen printing from Ag nanoparticle ink, which is much lower than that of ITO. Furthermore, the printed Ag grids were used as the current collecting electrode in combination with high conducting PEDOT:PSS to replace ITO in OSCs to yield an efficiency increase by a factor of two. As the fabrication of Ag grids is done with a solution process and does not require high temperature annealing or lithography steps, it can reduce the manufacturing cost and contribute towards low-cost fully printed devices, such as in roll-to-roll manufacturing. The problem for screen printing is that over-coating of these relatively high grid lines with PEDOT:PSS and an active layer is very difficult, and the devices are easily shorted. Such grids can only be used when they are embedded into a substrate. An interesting alternative for screen-printed metal grids is ink-jet printing. With ink-jet printing the amount of printed metal ink can be accurately controlled, and therefore, very thin lines with a typical resolution of 30–50 μm can be printed. The problem is that increasing the height of the grid lines automatically leads to increased line widths, and therefore to enhanced shadow losses.
Nanoimprint lithography can be used to fabricate various metal grid electrodes including Au, Cu and Ag to replace conventional ITO for OSCs. The nanopatterned metal electrodes showed high light transmittance in the visible range as well as high electrical conductivity. OSCs based on nanopatterned Ag grid electrodes of optimum geometry showed essentially the same performance as devices made with high quality ITO electrodes. However, their light transmittance was still lower than that of ITO electrodes at 500 nm, and the technique became complicated with a gentle transfer process when used for the fabrication of flexible devices.
The combination of inkjet printing and reverse nanoimprinting transfer has been used to fabricate Ag grids embedded within the substrate as front electrode structures for OSCs. The smooth interface between Ag grids and PEDOT:PSS improved the topology of the successive layers, resulting in reduced current leakage. As a result, an enhancement in the fill factor (FF > 60%) of ITO-free OSCs was observed, which can be compared to that based on the ITO electrode.
Recently, a combination of nanoimprinting and electrodeposition was developed to fabricate metal grid electrodes. For example, the fabricated Ag/Ni metal-mesh had a surface roughness of 0.17 nm, a low sheet resistance of 2.1 Ω □−1, and a high transmittance of 88.6%. The FOM was 1450, which was 30 times better than that of ITO. In addition, the hybrid electrode showed outstanding mechanical durability and environmental stability at high temperature and humidity. As a result, a flexible quantum dot LED was fabricated with an efficiency of 10.4 cd A−1 and 3.2 lm W−1 at 1000 cd m−2. A Ag/Cu composite grid electrode with a sheet resistance of <1 Ω □−1 and a light transmittance of 84% was produced for flexible OSCs. As a result, large-area flexible OSCs were demonstrated with high efficiencies of 12.26% (1 cm2), 7.79% (4 cm2) and 7.35% (9 cm2), respectively, which were much higher than those with conventional ITO electrodes. In addition, the flexible OSCs showed excellent mechanical durability and long-term stability. However, the fabrication of composite grid electrodes was quite complicated with several steps.

The sheet resistance and light transmittance have been the focus of many endeavors of FTEs based on AgNWs. However, they are not sufficient for evaluating the performance of FTEs, and several other properties should also be considered for the evaluation of FTEs depending on the application.


Mechanical flexibility, such as bending, stretching, folding and twisting, is one of the featured characteristics of FTEs based on AgNWs, paving the way for flexible electronics. However, most of the endeavors in FOEs were focused on bending, which caused only small strains far less than 10%, and folding as the final goal in the long term. Stretching may be the most demanding as it directly gives the value of strain. It is therefore more critical and more scientific to use stretching as a standard test. In this case, two aspects are critical: the change of resistance (R/R0) for one-time stretching and for strain cycling. Unlike ITO and many other TEs, the conductivity of FTEs can withstand bending tests, and they also show good responses in the case of stretching. For instance, the GO-soldered AgNW network on flexible substrates such as PET and poly(urethane acrylate) (PUA) has been reported to show only 2–3% increase in sheet resistance after 12000 bending cycles, and GO solder can also improve the stretchability of the AgNW network with a R/R0 of 20 at a strain of 100% (Fig. 14). AgNWs on a PDMS substrate have been reported to withstand up to 76% tensile strain and 250 bending cycles of 15% strain with a negligible increase in electrical resistance. Another very significant advantage of AgNW networks is their ability to conform to non-planar surfaces. This may be useful in various applications involving highly roughened surfaces.


Haze, defined by the ratio of scattered light to transmitted light, is also a critical property of FTEs. However, the impact of haze has been overlooked based on the current FOM models in which conductivity and transmittance are considered to evaluate the performance of FTEs. For commercial ITO electrodes, haze is often listed in the product specification as a routine parameter. Some devices such as liquid crystal displays require low haze in order to offer a higher definition, while devices like solar cells do not have a rigid requirement on haze. Preston et al. conducted a theoretical and experimental study on the haze of AgNWs, finding that coarser films of AgNWs with larger diameter gave higher haze. In this case, the haze factors can be much different for the films with different diameters of AgNWs even if they had nearly equal conductivity and transmittance. Niu et al. reported a modified polyol synthesis of AgNWs with average diameters as thin as 13 nm and an aspect ratio of up to 3000. The 13 nm AgNWs demonstrated less than 1% haze, ranking the best as compared to the haze values reported before as shown in Fig. 15. Typically, lower haze is observed for AgNW networks with a larger transmittance over 92% at 550 nm. In addition, haze is expected to be related to the surface roughness of the FTEs. Generally speaking, low haze is desired for many applications. AgNWs with narrower size distribution and less NP contaminants are considered to be beneficial for achieving a low haze factor in FTEs.


The morphology of electrodes plays an important role in the subsequent active layer growth, and thus the roughness of AgNWs is another important parameter of FTEs. Generally, lower surface roughness allows for stronger bonding and easier post processing, and contributes to high performance of the devices. For example, the traditional ITO has a smooth and continuous surface with a RMS roughness of 2.5–3 nm, which makes it compatible with organic devices such as OLEDs and OSCs. However solution processed AgNW networks often exhibit large roughness and a discontinuous surface due to the fact that AgNWs are not strictly in the same film plane when they are randomly scattered on the substrate, and the surface roughness can be at least two nanowire diameters which can be 200–300 nm. Furthermore, the cascading AgNWs can be easily removed from the substrate due to the poor adhesion, which may lead to the problem of short circuit in devices. There are several ways to improve the surface roughness of AgNW networks. Mechanical pressing was reported to improve not only the conductance but also the film morphology, resulting in a decrease in the surface roughness of AgNW electrodes from 110 nm to 47 nm (Fig. 16a and b). Burying the AgNWs into a transparent polymer, such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polyimide (PI) or PET, can reduce the surface roughness from 75 nm to 1.27 nm with high transmittance and low sheet resistance (Fig. 16c and d). Very recently, the doping of AgNWs with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PH1000) resulted in a high-quality FTE of PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000:AgNWs with a smooth surface (RMS = 5.22 nm), low sheet resistance (6 Ω sq−1) and high transmittance (86% at 550 nm), and the flexible OSCs based on PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000:AgNWs demonstrated the highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the flexible ITO-free OSCs to date.


Adhesion between AgNWs and the flexible substrate is also very important for FTEs, as AgNWs can be easily peeled off during the bending process if there is no suitable adhesion. To get good stretchability, suitable adhesion is required for the distributed rupture to occur during the stretching process. The mechanical tape test is commonly used to assess the film adhesion to the substrate. Generally, the bare AgNW electrode on a PET substrate showed poor adhesion with a large resistance increase after the mechanical tape test (3M tape with finger pressure), and the adhesion can be greatly improved by encapsulation with a thin layer of organic materials such as Teflon, resulting in a small sheet resistance increase with the tape test. Embedding AgNWs into the surface of a polymer matrix, which involves the transfer of nanowires from one substrate to another, provides one way to improve adhesion and to decrease surface roughness. Akter et al. demonstrated that the adhesion of AgNWs to PDMS could be improved by coating PDMS with polydopamine prior to spray-coating AgNWs, and the film remained on the substrate after a tape peel test. Jin et al. adapted their approach to mix polydopamine and alginic acid into the AgNWs, and spray-coated this mixture onto a PET substrate. The resultant AgNW network exhibited a sheet resistance of 16.3 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 89% at 550 nm without thermal annealing. Moreover, the AgNW film exhibits strong adhesion to the substrate, maintaining its conductivity after 100 tape tests, and it still resists the tape test even after exposure to solvent for several hours (Fig. 17). Zilberberg et al. deposited a layer of tin oxide (SnOx) via a sol–gel process on top of a spin-coated AgNW film, resulting in the decrease of sheet resistance from 90 to 5.2 Ω sq−1 and light transmittance from 79 to 72 at 632.8 nm. Furthermore, the surface roughness was reduced from 65 to 34 nm after the coating of SnOx, and the sheet resistance remained unchanged after a tape peel test.


Stability including mechanical and ambient stability is a very important issue for practical device applications based on FTEs. Mechanical stability characterizes the dynamic durability or fatigue of FTEs resisting the external strain, such as bending, stretching, folding and twisting. For example, ITO/PET had a poor mechanical stability with the sheet resistance increased by ∼120 times upon the bending 100 times to 5 mm, while the AgNW electrode with a thin encapsulation layer of Teflon showed outstanding robustness with the sheet resistance increased slightly by ∼6%. The mechanical stability is closely related to the property of flexibility, which has been discussed in the previous section. Here we will mainly discuss the ambient stability.

Ambient stability including thermal and chemical stability characterizes the static storage of FTEs, and it is more related to the intrinsic properties of AgNWs. For example, as is well known, thermal annealing is a routine process used to improve the conductivity of AgNWs, but AgNWs cannot withstand very high temperature for a long period due to the coalescence of AgNWs into disconnected droplets. The up limit temperature varied from 200 to 260 °C depending on the diameters of AgNWs, that is, the smaller the diameter of AgNWs, the lower the temperature associated with the thermal stability. Moreover, Ag atoms can react with oxygen and acids, and AgNW based FTEs are not chemically stable when they are exposed to air and acids. It is considered that the atmospheric sulfide will react with Ag, converting it into Ag2S, which is much less conductive and has a greater absorption cross-section. In this case, additional procedures must be performed to enhance the thermal and chemical stability.
It seems that the hybridization of AgNWs with other materials is a promising way to improve the thermal stability. For example, the use of graphene or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with AgNWs had been shown to increase the robustness and stability of the hybrid electrode. In addition, the covering or encapsulation of AgNWs with a thin layer of metal oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2 or Al2O3, was found to significantly improve the thermal and chemical stability by preventing oxidation. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to fabricate the protection layer of Al2O3 on AgNWs in a very conformal and homogeneous way without significantly impacting the transmittance of the resulting FTEs (Fig. 18), while improving the contact between AgNWs and the underlying substrate at the same time; as a result, both the mechanical and ambient stabilities of the electrode were obviously improved.

AgNW-based FTEs have shown potential applications in FOEs, such as OLEDs, OSCs, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic electrical memory devices, due to their unique features such as low-cost, solution-processability, high-performance, flexibility, scalability, portability and wearability. Among these merits, flexibility is considered to be the most fascinating and basic property to the next generation OEs. From the view point of application, hybrid electrodes combining AgNWs with other materials, such as graphene, CNTs, conducting polymers or metal oxides, are more promising than the bare AgNW networks due to the improved performance and stability. Many reports demonstrated the significantly enhanced performance in OEs when hybrid electrodes were used instead of the bare AgNW electrode.


FTEs with good performance and low cost are critical for flexible and large-scale OLEDs, in which AgNWs present several advantages over traditional ITO electrodes. The application of AgNW electrodes can avoid the device degradation induced by indium diffusion from ITO. More importantly, AgNWs are well compatible with flexible plastic substrates and arbitrary surfaces due to their excellent solution-processability. Therefore, the AgNW-based device can be flexible and scalable, which makes it compatible with low-cost, roll-to-roll production.

The low cost and high performance of AgNWs make them a promising alternative to ITO as the FTE for OLEDs, but the surface roughness of AgNW films should be reduced to be comparable to ITO. Yu et al. reported a smooth AgNW surface on a polymer substrate by a transferring technique. Firstly, the AgNW dispersion was drop-cast on a glass substrate to form a conductive AgNW layer, and then a UV-cured polymer was coated on the AgNW layer, and finally the transfer of the AgNW layer from the glass substrate to the polymer was realized by a peel-off process (Fig. 19). With this technique, the AgNW layer demonstrated a very smooth surface compared with that on the glass substrate. The flexible electrodes can be bent up to 16% compressive strain with negligible change in sheet resistance, and the resistance change can be fully recovered when the deformed electrode returned to its undeformed shape. The efficiency of the PLEDs based on AgNW electrodes was as high as 14.0 cd A−1, slightly higher than that of the control devices with the ITO anode, and the device performance exhibited little change after the large angle bending test. This work shows the bright future of large-scale and fully flexible AgNW-based OLEDs. Gaynor et al. made smooth AgNW anodes by coating a transparent substrate with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), spray-coating AgNWs onto the PMMA coated substrate, and then pressing or embedding AgNWs into the surface of PMMA while heating the substrate. The surface roughness can be further reduced by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS onto AgNWs following UV-ozone treatment. As a result, the current efficiency (CE) of white OLEDs fabricated on these electrodes was higher than that on ITO. A power efficiency (PE) of over 30 lm W−1 was achieved with the white OLED at 1000 cd m−2, and this can be further increased to 54 lm W−1 with outcoupling techniques. In addition, the AgNW anode also improved the angular color stability of the OLED relative to ITO due to its relatively greater haze. With similar techniques to those employed by Gaynor, Lian et al. embedded AgNWs into PVA to form a smooth and uniform composite electrode. Mechanical pressing was then applied to weld AgNWs without high-temperature annealing, resulting in a sheet resistance of 3 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 83% with a low surface roughness. Due to the good adhesion and excellent flexibility of the electrode, the OLEDs with the PVA/AgNW anode on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate presented a 27% improvement in CE compared to the controlled ITO device with the same structure. Later, the same group fabricated another hybrid electrode with high conductivity and low roughness by embedding AgNWs into an inorganic layer such as alginate. The hybrid electrode demonstrated a sheet resistance of 2.3 Ω sq−1 with a transmittance of 83% at 550 nm, showing excellent flexibility and great adhesion of AgNWs to the substrate. OLED devices with the alginate/AgNW anode presented comparable performance to that with ITO. In addition, PEDOT:PSS-coated AgNWs demonstrated a low sheet resistance of 12 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 83% at 550 nm with a smooth surface. The improvement in conductivity and roughness is ascribed to the fusion of nanowires resulting from the mechanical hot-pressing. With the hot-pressed AgNW/PEDOT:PSS film as the anode, ITO-free OLEDs have been successfully fabricated with a maximum CE of 58.2 cd A−1, which is higher than that of the device with an ITO anode.
AgNWs were mostly used as anodes in OLEDs due to their relatively high work function or the modified ones, resulting in improved or comparable device performance to that with ITO anodes. Kim et al. developed Au-coated AgNW electrodes with negligible damage to AgNWs by simply applying a diluted solution of HAuCl4, which can enhance hole injection in OLEDs. The work function of the AgNW film increased upon Au coating. The resulting devices based on Au-coated AgNWs showed lower turn-on voltage and higher luminance than pristine AgNW based devices, but poor efficiency and low luminance due to high leakage. On the other hand, AgNWs have also been reported to be used as a cathode in OLEDs, and the interface layer is quite important because of the relatively high work function of AgNWs. For example, Pei et al. demonstrated fully stretchable white OLEDs for the first time by employing the GO-soldered AgNW network as both the anode and the cathode, in which PEDOT:PSS and PEI were used as hole and electron transport layers respectively. When embedded in the surface layer of the elastomeric PUA, the flexible OLED can survive after one-time elongation up to 130%, or 100 stretching cycles between 0 and 40% strain. This result proves that the percolating AgNW can serve as both anode and cathode for stretchable electronics. In addition, dielectric/metal/dielectric multilayers have been well demonstrated as cathodes in OLEDs, and this idea may be transferred to the applications of AgNWs as the cathode in the future. For example, Hong et al. investigated the device performance of top emitting OLEDs based on an FTE cathode with the structure of WO3/Ag/WO3. Compared with that based on the Al cathode, the maximum luminance (J = 220 mA cm−2) increased from 8400 to 11700 cd m−2, and the PE increased nearly 26%.
The mismatch of the refractive index between the substrate, TEs, and organic layers causes a total internal reflection at the interfaces, which significantly limits the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in OLEDs. Therefore, the improvement of light-outcoupling has been considered as a very important approach for high efficiency AgNW-based OLEDs. Kim et al. developed a high-performance internal light-outcoupling system based on the high-refractive index PI and metal oxide NPs for OLEDs with AgNWs. The spontaneously formed nanobump structures, with a high refractive index and light-scattering properties, significantly enhance the light-extraction efficiency of OLEDs. Not only do the outcoupling structures improve the light-extraction efficiency, but also remarkably enhance the electrical properties of OLEDs. The PE of the AgNW-based OLEDs with PI is improved by a factor of 1.31 as compared to that of the reference device with ITO at a luminance of 20000 cd m−2. The efficiency can be further improved by a factor of 1.69 with the incorporation of TiO2 NPs into the PI matrix. In addition, the outcoupling structures are solution processable, thermally stable, and can be scaled up to 200 × 200 mm2 for large-area applications. Huang et al. reported a flexible nanocomposite substrate to enhance the light outcoupling efficiency of white OLEDs. The substrate comprised of AgNWs as the electrode and periodic wrinkles as external structures for light extraction. With the optimized external light extraction structures, white OLEDs based on the nanocomposite substrates showed an EQE enhancement factor of 2.34 as compared to control devices based on ITO, with an EQE of (38.4 ± 2.7)%, a PE of 85.8 ± 2.9 lm W−1, and a CE of 100.3 ± 7.1 cd A−1 at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2. The nanocomposite substrate is fully solution-processed and thus can potentially lower the manufacturing cost of high-efficiency flexible OLEDs. Tong et al. achieved efficient light extraction in OLEDs by using a nanocomposite substrate which was fabricated by embedding AgNWs within a light scattering layer comprising of acrylate admixed with high-index barium strontium titanate (BST) NPs. With an enhanced light outcoupling system, white OLEDs subsequently fabricated on the nanocomposite substrates demonstrated a PE of 107 lm W−1 and an EQE of 49% at 1000 cd m−2. This strategy has shown a comparable or better light enhancement factor in comparison to other outcoupling techniques based on substrate architectures. The nanocomposite substrate was fabricated by solution processes at low temperatures with potentially low manufacturing cost, which can be readily adopted in roll-to-roll technologies for mass production. Recently, a NP-enhanced AgNW plasmonic electrode was fabricated via the decoration of AgNWs with core–shell silver-silica NPs (Ag@SiO2NPs) which played an important role as a nanoantenna, serving to couple incoming light into NW plasmons propagating along NWs. NP-enhanced plasmonic AgNW (Ag@SiO2NP-AgNW) electrodes enabled substantially enhanced radiative emission and light absorption efficiency, leading to improved device performance in OLEDs and OSCs. A CE of 25.33 cd A−1 (at 3.2 V) and a PE of 25.14 lm W−1 (3.0 V) in OLEDs, as well as a PCE value of 9.19% in OSCs were achieved with hybrid Ag@SiO2NP-AgNW as an electrode. The mechanism of the NP-enhanced plasmonic AgNW network and the corresponding device performance are shown in Fig. 20.
The orientation, patterning and distribution of AgNWs have important effects on the performance of the electrode and thus the device based on AgNWs. Triambulo et al. reported highly flexible OLEDs by use of patterned AgNW network TEs. The results demonstrated that the mechanical stability of OLED devices depended on the type of flexible anodes. Although organic active layers are normally considered to have compliant mechanical properties due to their organic composition, they only showed excellent mechanical stability when coated on the AgNW anode, while they showed brittle fractures when coated on the ITO reference anode and the AgNW-ITO hybrid anode with PI as the flexible substrate. The reasons lie in the fact that the residual strain during the bending test resulted in brittle fractures in OLEDs for ITO and AgNW/ITO as anodes. Furthermore, AgNWs with line and serpentine patterns can significantly improve the bending stability of OLEDs due to the reduced residual strain and localized deformation. Orthogonally weaved AgNW networks were found to possess predominant advantages of a lower percolation limit, higher transmittance and lower sheet resistance than the randomly oriented AgNWs. The resulting AgNW electrode exhibited a transmittance of 94% and a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1. The OLED based on AgNWs demonstrated a CE, PE, and EQE of 92 cd A−1, 111 lm W−1, and 26.8%, respectively, which were 10–20% higher than those of ITO-based OLEDs with the same device structure. In addition, although solution processed AgNWs are a potential candidate to replace ITO, their performance is still limited in device applications due to the reduced effective electrical area arising from the dimple structure and percolative voids that single size AgNWs inevitably possess. To solve this problem, Lee et al. presented a TE based on dual-scale AgNWs embedded in a flexible substrate (Fig. 21), which demonstrated a significant enhancement in the effective electrical area by filling the large percolative voids presented in a long/thick AgNW network with short/thin AgNWs. A flexible OLED was demonstrated to improve the device performance with the dual-scale AgNWs compared to the single sized AgNWs, and also mechanical and ambient stabilities were greatly improved.
Although bare AgNWs have been reported as electrodes in OLEDs, the stability is one of the critical issues. Lee et al. applied the electrodes based on bare AgNWs to a flexible phosphorescent OLED, and the maximum EQE and CE of the resulting device were 18.7% and 68.6 cd A−1, respectively. Although a high CE of 68.6 cd A−1 was achieved, the stability of the bare AgNWs should be improved in the future. Hybrid electrodes combining AgNWs with other materials, such as graphene, CNTs, conducting polymers or metal oxides, are more promising than the bare AgNW networks due to the improved performance and stability of FTEs. Xu et al. fabricated the hybrid FTE of AgNW/PEDOT:PSS/graphene with a transmittance and sheet resistance of 88.29% and 30 Ω sq−1, respectively, and when it was used as the anode in OLEDs, all devices demonstrated comparable performance to those based on the ITO anode. These devices with the composite electrode showed a higher turn-on voltage of 4.4 V than those with ITO (3.8 V) and exhibited a CE of 2.68 cd A−1 at 200 mA cm−2. Liang et al. reported AgNWs soldered with GO at room temperature for fully stretchable PLEDs. The GO-soldered AgNWs had a sheet resistance of 14 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 88% at 550 nm, and their storage stability was improved as compared to that of the high-temperature annealed AgNWs. The GO-soldered AgNWs showed excellent bending stability with only 2–3% increase in the sheet resistance after 12000 bending cycles with 4 mm bending radius. GO soldering also improved the stretchability of AgNWs. As a result, fully stretchable white PLEDs were fabricated for the first time with GO-soldered AgNWs on a PET substrate as both the anode and cathode. The PLED can survive after 100 stretching cycles between 0 and 40% strain and can be stretched up to 130% linear strain at room temperature. Li et al. proposed a multifunctional hybrid electrode consisting of AgNWs, ZnO and PEDOT:PSS for high-performance flexible OLEDs (Fig. 22). The trapped light in the waveguide and substrate modes is effectively released by integrating aperiodic nanostructures into high-refractive-index nanopatterned ZnO layers, resulting in a decrease in surface roughness and an increase of the light outcoupling. A maximum EQE of 61.7% and a PE of 126.6 lm W−1 are achieved for the white emission flexible OLEDs with broadband and angle-independent outcoupling enhancement. In addition, the proposed approach allows for excellent flexibility, retaining over 80% of the initial efficiency after 3000 cycles of repeated bending.
Tandem OLEDs have shown potential to realize low-cost full-color displays, in which two or more subdiodes are vertically stacked on top of each other with charge interconnecting layers (CILs). However, most CILs are fabricated by thermal evaporation, resulting in complicated device fabrication; it is important to develop CILs by solution processing to realize low-cost full-color OLEDs. Guo et al. introduced a AgNW layer as the intermediate CIL in a tandem OLED device via solution processing, which allowed the control of the emission spectrum of the tandem device. A color-tunable display was then realized by the fabrication of a 4-by-4 pixelated display from the color-tunable tandem devices. Therefore, full-color OLED devices can be manufactured with such a low-cost and elegant approach.
The large surface roughness of AgNW networks can induce electrical short in devices, and the charge transport can be limited by the porosity of AgNWs. In addition, the interfacial properties are quite different for AgNWs and continuous ITO films formed with organic materials. Therefore, it is very important to understand charge carrier dynamics in such devices from the view of interfaces. Kim et al. systematically studied the effects of charge injection of a hybrid electrode of AgNW/PEDOT:PSS on the device performance of OLEDs by comparison with those of the ITO electrode. It was observed that AgNWs exhibit excellent charge injection properties and that the interfaces between the AgNWs and the HTL have very small charge injection barriers. However, there was a big mismatch in the number of holes and electrons in AgNW-based OLEDs, resulting in a large leakage current of holes which didn’t contribute to the radiative recombination with electrons. To improve the balance of holes and electrons, polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) doped with cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) was used to decrease the electron injection barriers. As a result, the performance of AgNW-based OLEDs was significantly enhanced.

As is well known, the morphology of the electrode plays an important role in the subsequent active layer growth, particularly for the flexible OSCs. Initial attempts to replace ITO in OSCs with AgNW network electrodes resulted in relatively low PCEs ranging from 0.63% to 3.5% mainly due to the large surface roughness of AgNWs. As a result, many OSCs made with bare AgNW electrodes have exhibited a small shunt resistance, and correspondingly a low PCE. Various approaches have been developed to reduce the roughness, and thus to improve device performance. Embedding AgNWs into a polymer surface to give a RMS roughness less than 5 nm resulted in a device efficiency of 3.3%. Lamination of AgNWs into the surface of a PEDOT:PSS layer to give a surface with a RMS roughness of 12 nm resulted in a device efficiency of 4.2%. Song et al. achieved high device efficiency (5.8%) for AgNW electrodes compared with that (6.7%) for ITO, but surprisingly required no additional smoothing procedures to achieve this efficiency. This may be due to the fact that the diameter of nanowires (25 ± 5 nm) and the corresponding RMS roughness of the as-coated AgNW film (13 nm) were small enough that they did not negatively impact the device efficiency. The relatively high efficiency of the device in this case was principally due to the high performance (a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 at a transmittance of 95% at 550 nm) of the AgNW based electrodes. Very recently, AgNWs were reported to dope highly conductive PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) to optimize the optical and electronic properties of the PH1000 film, which is shown in Fig. 23. A flexible composite electrode with a very smooth surface, a low sheet resistance of 6 Ω sq−1 and a high transmittance of 86% at 550 nm was obtained by doping 20 wt% AgNWs to PH1000 (PH1000:AgNW-20). The flexible OSCs based on the PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000:AgNW-20 electrode delivered a PCE of 12.07% with an open circuit voltage (VOC), a short-circuit current density (JSC) and a fill factor (FF) of 0.826 V, 20.90 mA cm−2 and 69.87%, respectively. Note that the PCE is the highest reported value for the flexible ITO-free OSCs. This work demonstrated that the flexible composite electrodes of PET/Ag-mesh/PH1000:AgNWs are promising alternatives for the conventional PET/ITO electrode, and open a new avenue for developing high-performance FTEs for optoelectronic devices.

AgNW networks are mostly used as anodes at the bottom of conventional OSCs or on top of inverted OSCs to replace the ITO electrode; however, AgNWs can also be used as cathodes in OSCs, and thus they can even be used as both anodes and cathodes in a fully solution-processed whole device. Yim et al. reported semitransparent OSCs with AgNWs as the cathode and highly doped PEDO:PSS as the anode. The fully solution-processed semitransparent OSCs had PCEs of 2.3 and 2.0% under cathode- and anode-side illumination, respectively, which were comparable to previously reported semitransparent OSCs with ITO electrodes and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) active layers. Yusoff et al. used laminated AgNWs as the top cathode in semitransparent tandem solar cells. The laminated top electrode can be deposited without causing any damage to the underneath organic solar cells. The PCEs of 8.02% and 6.47% were obtained when the light was projected from the solution-processed graphene mesh and laminated AgNWs, respectively. The performance of the tandem solar cell was found to be comparable to that fabricated with commercial ITO. Guo et al. reported fully solution-processed inverted semitransparent OSCs with a fill factor (FF) as high as 63.0%, which was comparable to that of the ITO based reference device. The high performance was enabled by utilizing AgNWs as both bottom and top electrodes with AZO and PEDOT:PSS as charge extraction layers. Later, the same group reported fully printed tandem OSCs with solution-processed Ag as the reflective bottom electrode and AgNWs as the transparent top electrode (Fig. 24). The ITO-free tandem OSCs were fully printed under ambient conditions without the use of vacuum-based deposition, leading to a PCE of 5.81% (on glass) and 4.85% (on a flexible substrate) without VOC losses. These results indicate important progress for fully printed OSCs. Xie et al. successfully fabricated fully solution-processed semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with AgNWs as the top cathode by the ink-jet printing technique. A thin layer of polyethylenimine (PEI) was introduced between the PC61BM and AgNWs to improve the device performance by decreasing the work function of the AgNW electrode and thus reducing the electron injection barrier, and by preventing the chemical corrosion of AgNWs during the printing process. As a result, a high PCE of 14.17% with an averaged visible transparency of 21.2% was achieved. In addition, improved performance stability was demonstrated.
AgNW composite electrodes or those embedded in polymer substrates, such as PEDOT:PSS/AgNWs, polymer/AgNWs, polyelectrolyte/AgNWs, graphene/AgNWs, GO/AgNWs, CNTs/AgNWs, MXene/AgNWs, and metal oxide/AgNWs, were more extensively studied in solar cells due to the improved device performance and mechanical stability. For example, with a AgNW–polymer composite electrode, the PCE of OSCs based on the P3HT/PCBM bulk heterojunction can be compared to that of the control device with an ITO electrode; more importantly, the devices were much more flexible and can be bent to a maximum 8% strain with negligible damage to device efficiency. Zhou et al. reported a PEDOT:PSS:S/AgNW hybrid electrode via the in situ oxidative polymerization of EDOT in an aqueous solution with PSS and acid-modified AgNWs, resulting in a sheet resistance of 64 Ω sq−1 at a transmittance of 94.8% at 550 nm. Furthermore, the reduced work function (4.78 eV) and hydrophobic characteristics for PEDOT:PSS/AgNWs were beneficial to form an ohmic contact with the ZnO layer and improve the device stability. As a result, the OSCs based on the hybrid electrode displayed a PCE of 10.2% and quite good storage stability. Very recently for the first time, Tang et al. fabricated MXene/AgNW hybrid electrodes via a simple and scalable solution-processed method for flexible OSCs as shown in Fig. 25. AgNWs were firstly coated on a release substrate through a slot-die process, and then a PUA precursor was coated onto the AgNW surface with subsequent polymerization under ultraviolet curing, by which AgNWs were embedded on the surface of the PUA matrix and could be easily peeled off from the release substrate. Finally, the AgNW/PUA films were immersed in a MXene nanosheet dispersion to finish the fabrication of MXene/AgNW flexible electrodes. With this process, the hybrid electrodes demonstrated a low sheet resistance of 26 Ω sq−1, a high transmittance of ∼84% at 550 nm, a low average roughness of 1.52 nm and a high work function of −5.28 eV. The hybrid electrodes were incorporated in flexible OSCs with a fullerene-based PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, a nonfullerene-based PBDB-T:ITIC system, and a ternary structure of PBDB-T:ITIC:PC71BM, achieving the highest PCE of 8.30%. In addition, the flexible device showed robust mechanical performance, retaining 84.6% of its initial PCE after 1000 bending and unbending cycles to a 5 mm bending radius. As exploiting biomass has raised great interest as an alternative to the fossil resources for environmental protection, Lam et al. developed a bio-based flexible, conductive film using a renewable polyethylene furanoate (PEF) substrate and AgNWs.The PEF exhibited a high transmittance of 90% in the visible wavelength and good adhesion to AgNWs. The PEF/AgNW showed only a slight increase in the sheet resistance (<4%) after a 500 cycle bending test, in striking contrast to the case of the PET/AgNW film. The resulting OSCs achieved a PCE of 6.7%, which was superior to that based on the ITO/PEN electrode. Very recently, Sun et al. reported flexible transparent electrodes denoted FlexAgNEs by spin-coating on PET from the mixed suspension of water-processed AgNWs and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) as a polyelectrolyte. Due to ionic electrostatic charge repulsion, the nanowires formed grid-like structures in a single step without any post-treatment, leading to smooth, flexible electrodes with a sheet resistance of around 10 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of around 92%. Flexible OSCs were then fabricated based on FlexAgNEs with different types of donors and acceptors, which exhibited performance comparable to that based on commercial ITO. Furthermore, flexible single-junction and tandem devices achieved PCEs of 13.1% and 16.5%, respectively. Most interestingly, flexible OSCs demonstrated exceptional mechanical bending stability as indicated in Fig. 26. The performance of all the tested cells remained essentially unchanged (>96% PCEs retained) with a bending radius down to 1.5 mm (Fig. 26d) and over 95% of their initial PCEs retained after a 1000-cycle bending test with a bending radius of 5 mm (Fig. 26e).
Patterned or oriented AgNWs have shown special function to improve the surface roughness and light trapping in lightweight and flexible OSCs. Groep et al. demonstrated large-area fabrication of AgNWs using soft-imprint nanolithography. The AgNW network had low sheet resistance (8.7 Ω sq−1) and high transmittance (∼87%) and worked as a light trapping structure in OSCs to enhance light absorption. The devices showed improved performance compared to ITO. Guo et al. first used nanoimprinted metal grids in organic solar cells based on P3HT and PCBM, with efficiency comparable to those using ITO electrodes. However, the flexibility of the solar cells was not studied. The solution processed AgNWs were then applied to replace the metal grids, and the P3HT/PCBM cells with AgNW electrodes demonstrated 19% higher short circuit current, but ∼10% lower efficiency due to the much lower fill factor. Similar results were found for solar cells with mechanically pressed AgNW network electrodes.
The combination of different sizes of AgNWs or AgNWs and Ag NPs has been shown to improve the conductivity and reduce the surface roughness. For example, Lu et al. fabricated a transparent nano-network electrode by integration of Ag NPs on AgNWs under room conditions, in which Ag NPs were selectively grown and chemically integrated in situ at the junction of AgNWs by a plasmon-induced chemical reaction. There was a tremendous conductivity improvement in the Ag nano-network as compared to AgNW electrodes, while the loss in transmittance was negligible. Furthermore, the Ag nano-network electrode exhibited superior electrical stability. OSCs with Ag nano-networks as top electrodes showed comparable device performance to the reference device. Wu et al. demonstrated that multi-length scaled AgNW grids which were fabricated by top-down patterning with a neutral vapor etching process can be a potential replacement for ITO in OSCs (Fig. 27a and b). The patterning of AgNW films into multi-length scale grid structures could improve the light transmittance and absorption. Based on multi-length scale AgNW grids, inverted OSCs with PCE up to 9.02% were realized, which were comparable to that with conventional ITO electrodes.
The tunable and amazing properties of plasmonic nanostructures have received significant attention in the fields of solar energy conversion. Plasmonic electrodes based on AgNWs have been recently reported to improve device performance in both OSCs and OLEDs. AgNWs were found to enhance the light absorption of P3HT by optical spectroscopy, resulting from the plasmon excitation in AgNWs. This finding provided a way towards the improvement of the efficiency of OSCs through the incorporation of plasmonic nanostructures. Liu et al. investigated the origin of performance improvement from a single AgNW in plasmonic OSCs by using spatially resolved spectroscopy, which revealed the complex interplay of photophysical effects (polarization, excitonic and plasmonic) and structural effects influencing the performance of plasmonic solar cells. The processes of design, fabrication, passivation and placement of the metal nanostructures were essential for the activation of polarization dependent surface plasmon modes, which ensured optimal light scattering to the active layers. Yang et al. investigated the plasmonic effects on the properties of photovoltaic materials and the performance of inverted OSCs by introducing AgNWs at different interfaces in the devices, and thus rationally designed efficient plasmonic architecture to enhance the photocurrent. When AgNWs were located at the interface of ITO and ZnO, an increase of PCE from 3.10% to 4.05% and JSC from 8.01 mA cm−2 to 10.32 mA cm−2 was achieved for the inverted OSCs without reducing the VOC and FF. Kim et al. demonstrated a NP-enhanced plasmonic AgNW electrode via strong plasmon-coupling effects generated by aligned AgNWs decorated with core–shell silver-silica NPs (Ag@SiO2). The resulting Ag@SiO2–AgNW electrode enhanced light absorption due to the strong plasmon coupling, leading to an improved PCE of 9.19% in OSCs, which was among the highest values reported to date for OSCs based on AgNW electrodes.
Solution-processed AgNWs have also been used as the interconnecting layer in inverted tandem OSCs, which can further improve device performance as compared to single cells by use of two or more subcells with complementary light absorption. Furthermore, this technique can realize low-cost, fully solution-processed OSCs. Li et al. developed a universal approach to realize a solution-processed interconnecting layer by inserting an ultra-thin AgNW layer between hole and electron transport layers to convert a rectifying interface into an ohmic interface (Fig. 27c and d). The tandem device achieved a VOC of 1.44 V, a JSC of 8.64 mA cm−2, a FF of 58% and a PCE of 7.25%. Raïssi et al. demonstrated the benefit of AgNWs as the cathode and interconnecting layer between two subcells with complementary light absorption in tandem OSCs. The tandem device achieved a high PCE of 9.23%, a VOC of 1.47 V and a JSC of 11.23 mA cm−2. This suggested that AgNWs can be a good alternative as the interconnecting layer as well as the TE in ITO-free tandem devices.

Due to the low sheet resistance, high transmittance, good flexibility, improved surface roughness and the potential low-cost solution-processed techniques, AgNW-based FTEs have been widely applied in other OE devices based on organic semiconductors as active layers, such as light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), OFETs, and organic memory devices (OMDs). Surely there are many reports on AgNW-based FTEs in devices with CNTs or graphene as the active layers, and we will not discuss their progress here.

Miller et al. reported AgNW/optical adhesive (AgNW-OA) coatings on flexible substrates (PET and PDMS) as FTEs in LECs (Fig. 28a and b). The AgNW/OA electrode demonstrated low sheet resistance (<4 Ω sq−1), high transmittance (>80% at 550 nm) and a smooth surface (RMS < 10 nm). As a result, the flexible LECs based on AgNW/OA exhibited lighting performance comparable to those based on ITO electrodes, and these devices continued to emit light even when being bent to a radius as low as 1.5 mm and performed as unstrained devices after 20 bending cycles of 25% tensile strain. Liang et al. fabricated a high-performance, elastomeric LEC with a simple, all-solution process (Fig. 28c and d), in which the electrode comprised of AgNWs embedded in the surface layer of PUA. The AgNW/PUA electrodes were prepared by in situ polymerization and transfer with low sheet resistance (<25 Ω sq−1), light transmittance (>80% at 550 nm), a smooth surface and rubbery elasticity. The resulting LEC emitted light at strains as large as 120%, and showed significantly improved efficiency in the stretchable state. The fabrication was quite facile and scalable with potential applications in fully stretchable electronics. Recently, Liang et al. developed a facile water-assisted transfer printing to fabricate stretchable AgNW/PDMS electrodes, showing a robust approach for AgNW transfer onto arbitrary substrates. The obtained electrodes exhibited a low sheet resistance (9 Ω sq−1), high transmittance (82% at 550 nm), tensile strain (0% to 40%), and flexibility (bending radius of less than 2 mm) without significant loss of conductivity. Furthermore, a novel textile-based flexible LEC based on the AgNW/PDMS electrode was demonstrated, realizing highly stretchable LECs with excellent performance and mechanical robustness. The luminance of the strained device was optimized to 58 cd m−2 at 7 V under 10% linear strain without damaging the electroluminescence properties. The water-assisted transfer method paved the way for practical applications of AgNWs on various arbitrary substrates, thereby the realization of flexible stretchable applications in wearable electronics.
Chen et al. prepared top-gate/bottom-contact OFETs with AgNW/PEDOT:PSS as the OFET source and drain electrodes and Au as the gate electrode, in which the organic semiconductor is solution-processed 5,11-bistriethylsilylethynyl anthradithiophene (TES-ADT). The composite films showed a sheet resistance of 140 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 70%. Furthermore, the low contact resistance (2.7 × 104 Ω cm) and high work function (5.0 eV) afforded good electrical contact and energy-level alignment at the interface, resulting in a high-performance OFET device with a carrier mobility of up to 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results demonstrated the viability of spin-coated conductive films as source and drain electrodes for large area and flexible electronic applications. Kim et al. fabricated high-performance bottom-contact OFETs with AgNW networks as the source and drain electrodes, in which pentacene was used as the active layer via organic molecular beam deposition (Fig. 29). The AgNW network electrodes were deposited by spray coating with a sheet resistance as low as 10 Ω sq−1 and an average transmittance of up to 88%. The resulting bottom-contact OFETs exhibited a high mobility of up to 1.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 which was similar to that of the top-contact Au electrode OFETs with low contact resistance. The high performance was mainly attributed to the continuous morphology of pentacene crystals on AgNWs and the spreading out of individual AgNWs, which improved charge injection. Sanyoto et al. reported solution-processed PEDOT:PSS/AgNWs as source and drain electrodes for printed OFETs. The diketopyrrolopyrrole-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DPPT-TT) semiconducting polymer was used as the active layer. The highest mobility of ∼0.49 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an ON/OFF ratio of ∼103 for OFETs were obtained for PEDOT:PSS/AgNW electrodes due to the lower sheet resistance, and the flexible OFET showed a mobility of ∼0.36 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was slightly reduced to ∼0.19 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a drain voltage of 80 V after 2000 bending cycles. Albano et al. reported low voltage and high frequency vertical OFETs using AgNWs as the source gate through low-cost Meyer rod coating. Cross-linked PVA was used as a gate insulator and C60 as an n-type channel semiconductor. The device showed a high output current density of 2.5 mA cm−2 and an on/off ratio of 5 × 103, and presented a threshold voltage of about 1 V and a good switching performance up to 0.13 MHz. Xu et al. developed a cost-effective process to fabricate a flexible electrolyte-gated organic phototransistor with a AgNW/ionogel nanocomposite as the gate electrode, in which poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-thienothiophene) (PDPP2T) blended with PC61BM was used as the active layer, showing a broad spectral response from the ultraviolet to near-infrared region. The AgNW network was directly embedded into an ionogel dielectric layer with a high capacitance and showed low sheet resistance (<50 Ω sq−1) and ultrahigh optical transparency (>90%). The resulting phototransistor achieved a high responsivity of 1.5 × 103 A W−1, a high sensitivity of 7.5 × 105, and a 3 dB bandwidth of ∼100 Hz at very low voltages. The devices with fast and air-stable operations demonstrated the potential applications for wearable electronics and human–robot interactions in the future. Sarjidan et al. recently fabricated vertical organic light-emitting transistors (VOLETs) with AgNWs as the source electrode by spin coating, in which poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) was used as the organic semiconductor. The current and luminance intensity of the VOLETs can be modulated by a small bias at the gate electrode, and the devices gave a yellowish orange light emission. The maximum current of ∼1200 mA cm−2 and a luminance of ∼50 of cd cm−2 were obtained at Vd = 10 V and Vg = −3 V, respectively. The mobility of the VOLET was in the magnitude of 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. The saturation region was observed in the current and luminance transfer characteristics. Although the device performance is not fully optimized, this is the only example of OLETs with AgNWs reported so far to our knowledge.
Shih et al. used deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as the substrate for AgNW patterning, based on which flexible organic resistive memory devices were fabricated (Fig. 30). Random copolyimide composed of N,N-bis(4-aminophenyl)aminopyrene PI(APAP) was used as the active layer. The memory device exhibited typical write-once-read-many (WORM) memory features with a high ON/OFF ratio (104), long-term retention ability (104 s) and excellent mechanical endurance. Ali et al. reported an ITO-free flexible organic resistive switching device with poly(4-vinylphenol) as the active layer, CNTs/AgNWs as the bottom electrode and Ag dots as the top electrode. The memory device exhibited a slightly low ON/OFF ratio of 100, a retention time of 60 min and electrical endurance for 100 V sweeps without any noticeable decay in performance. In addition, the device can sustain more than 100 bending cycles at a bending diameter of 2 cm. Zhou et al. demonstrated a transient and flexible polymer memristor with full-solution processed polymer nanocomposites, which consisted of a configuration of AgNW/citric acid quantum dot (CA QD)–polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/AgNW. The device showed a volatile memory window spanning more than 105, a retention time of over 104 s, and a low set voltage of below <2 V. Meanwhile, the memristor exhibited high flexibility with stable electrical memory properties within a radius of 15 mm. Moreover, the device can be disintegrated through immersion in water within 30 minutes. These remarkable properties showed that the memristors possessed great potential for use in data storage, transient electronics, data storage security, and printed and flexible electronics.

This review briefly discusses the synthesis of AgNWs, film fabrication, the approaches to improve electrical conductivity, and the characterization of FTEs. Furthermore, the applications of AgNWs as FTEs in FOEs have been summarized as well.

In terms of light transmittance and sheet resistance, AgNW FTEs are comparable to or even better than commercial ITO electrodes, while exhibit much better flexibility and potential large-scale processing. However, the main problems of AgNWs to be overcome in the future lie in their intrinsic properties, such as poor dispersion, large haze, complex post-treatment, and still poor stability under thermal, chemical and ambient conditions. Based on the review of the recent progress in AgNWs as FTEs in OEs, breakthroughs should be made in the following aspects in the near future:
(1) As is well known, there is space between AgNWs, which will increase the sheet resistance and result in surface anisotropy in conductivity. In this case, interconnects inside AgNWs should be improved to have better contacts between nanowires and have uniform conductivity. To adapt to device fabrications, especially printing techniques, mild conditions should be developed to improve the conductivity of AgNWs. For example, it may be made by top-down methods to obtain better overall properties.
(2) Generally, the complicated transfer process of AgNWs is must for the fabrication of FTEs and devices, resulting in low production efficiency, low reproducibility, and poor adaptability to arbitrary substrates. Therefore, simple and highly efficient transfer techniques of AgNW films should be developed to realize low-cost fully solution-processed flexible electrodes and thus functional devices in the future.
(3) Besides the primary optoelectronic properties (sheet resistance and transmittance), more efforts should be focused on other properties depending on device applications, including haze, adhesion, surface roughness, bending, stretchability, and stability (under thermal, ambient and mechanical conditions). For example, optical haze is a property preferably maximized in transparent substrates integrated into solar cells, while other optoelectronic devices such as displays and touch panels require low optical haze. In this case, it is very important to investigate the optical haze of AgNW-based FTEs, although it still has not been intensively investigated. In addition, more attention should be paid to the interface between AgNWs and the above organic active layers, which may explain the imperfect device performance and the device failure during the flexibility test.
(4) The future optoelectronic devices will be revolutionized by the capability to print functional materials. Printed electronics involves the fabrication of devices on flexible substrates and over large areas at relatively low temperatures. New printing techniques should be developed to push flexible and large-scale device fabrication, which can fully utilize the advantages of AgNWs and realize the industrial production. Conductivity and uniformity are two key issues which should be considered during the printing process. In addition, for printed electronics, it would be critically important to print features with high conductivity while minimizing the processing temperature.
(5) AgNWs are known to be very vulnerable to heat, oxygen, moisture and light, and the degradation will be accelerated at elevated temperature. Furthermore, as current only flows through thin nanowire pathways and there are variations in the nanowire density, unlike in a continuous conducting film such as ITO, the surface temperature across AgNW-based FTEs is not uniform. When they are used in real devices, Joule heating will result in local melting and deformation of the plastic substrate leading ultimately to electrode failure. The degradation or failure mechanism of AgNWs is very complicated with different factors and is still not clear, therefore, it should be considered from the aspects of both theory and experiment as well, and new approaches should be developed to improve the stability of AgNWs.
