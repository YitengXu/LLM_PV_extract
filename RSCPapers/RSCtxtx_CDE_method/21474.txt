Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are a promising alternative for low-cost renewable energy due to their solution-process, flexibility and large-area fabrication. To improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC, a hole transport layer (HTL) is usually inserted between anode and active layer to enhance hole carrier collection. In this contribution, the utilization of solution processable self-doped sulfonic acid ring-substituted polyaniline (SPAN) thin film as the HTL in inverted PSC (i-PSC) composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction is demonstrated. The i-PSC with SPAN as the HTL exhibits an improvement over that with PEDOT:PSS (from 3.30 ± 0.14% to 3.54 ± 0.11%) due to higher conductivity and better film quality of SPAN relative to poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), suggesting that SPAN can be a promising alternative to PEDOT:PSS as the effective HTL for i-PSC.

Application of conjugated polymer as solar cells has attracted great attention due to the ease of fabrication, promising flexibility, large scale and low cost. Recently, the efficiencies of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cell (PSC) from 5 to over 7% have been demonstrated using conjugated polymer and fullerene derivatives as donor and acceptor materials, respectively, showing its potential as an active layer for photovoltaic devices.

For a conventional PSC (c-PSC), an active layer composed of polymer donor and acceptor material is sandwiched between transparent conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) and low work function metal electrode, in which ITO and metal collect hole and electron, respectively. However, prolonged exposure of this kind of device to air can lead to oxidation of the air sensitive metal electrode, resulting in degradation of PSC. In order to alleviate this problem, an approach involved the reverse of device architecture, the inverted PSC (i-PSC), is employed, in which a less air-sensitive high work function metal (Ag, Au) can be used as the back hole collecting electrode and ZnO or TiOx can be used as the electron collecting interlayer between ITO and active layer. For both types of PSC, the hole transport layer (HTL), such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) or metal oxide (WO3,VOx,MoO3 and NiO), have been introduced between the active layer and the anode to increase the hole-collecting ability. The metal oxides are deposited using vacuum deposition or pulsed-laser deposition, which are incompatible with the solution processable advantage of PSC. The PEDOT:PSS has the advantage of solution-process deposition, however the conductivity of spin-cast PEDOT:PSS film varies by orders of magnitude over different regions in the film, resulting in inhomogeneous hole collection. From these discussions, it is desirable to find a suitable alternative that is compatible with solution-process fabrication and also has good hole collection property.
In this work, we demonstrate the utilization of solution-processable self-doped sulfonic acid ring-substituted polyaniline (SPAN) as the HTL in the i-PSC composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) BHJ, in which solution-processable SPAN replaces commonly used PEDOT:PSS. In contrast to previous reports employing polyaniline doped with external acid (such as n-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA)) as interfacial layer in heterojunction solar cell (SC), no external protonic acid is needed in SPAN. The i-PSC with SPAN as the HTL exhibits an improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) over that with PEDOT:PSS (from 3.30 ± 0.14% to 3.54 ± 0.11%) due to higher conductivity and better film quality of SPAN relative to PEDOT:PSS, showing SPAN can be a promising alternative to PEDOT:PSS as the effective HTL for i-PSC. However, the transmittance of SPAN thin film is lower than that of PEDOT:PSS, limiting its application in c-PSC.

The SPAN can be converted from the emeraldine base of polyaniline (PAn) by sulfonation, and detailed synthetic procedures for the SPAN can be found in our previous report.Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra were measured using an UV-Vis-Near IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 19). The thickness of polymer film was measured by a Tencor P-10 Surface Profiler. The conductivity of thin film was determined by four-point probe method.


The fabrication procedure for the c-PSC is as follows: ITO glass plates were cleaned sequentially with detergent aqueous solution, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The cleaned ITO glass was then treated with oxygen plasma at a pressure of 193 mTorr for 5 min in a plasma generator chamber of a parallel electrode type. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI4083, 1.5 wt% in water) or SPAN (1.5 wt% in water) was spin-coated on the treated ITO. After drying for 10 min at 140 °C (PEDOT:PSS) or 30 min at 80 °C (SPAN) in vacuum, a thin layer (about 200 nm) of 2 wt% P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8, w/w) was deposited by spin-coating process from its solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene on top of these hole transport layers and dried in covered glass Petri dishes for 1 h. All the processes were carried out in a glove box with argon, except those for ITO cleaning and PEDOT:PSS (or SPAN) coating. Finally, a layer of Ca (about 15 nm) covered with a layer of Al as the cathode were deposited in a vacuum thermal evaporator through a shadow mask at a pressure of less than 2 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of the device is about 6.5 mm2.

For i-PSC, thin film of ZnO was prepared similar to the previously published procedures, in which ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm on top of the cleaned ITO, heating at 200 °C for 10 min in argon atmosphere and then sintering at 450 °C for 1 h in air, resulting in transparent ZnO thin film with the thickness about 60 nm. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2(H2O), 99.5%, Merck, 2 g) and monoethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 98%, Acros, 0.28 g) in anhydrous ethanol (9.1 ml) under stirring for 8 h for hydrolysis reaction and aging. On top of ZnO, a thin layer (about 210 nm) of 2.2 wt% P3HT:PCBM (1:1, w/w) was deposited by spin-casting process from its solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene in argon-filled glove box and dried in covered glass Petri dishes for 1 h. The devices were then moved to atmosphere, in which PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI4083) or SPAN was spin-coated onto the P3HT-PCBM as the HTL (about 60 nm). For both HTLs, surfactant of triton X-100 (laboratory grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to aqueous solution of HTL to improve wetting of HTL on the P3HT:PCBM surface (the weight ratio of solid content of PEDOT:PSS (or SPAN) aqueous solution to triton X-100 is 1.5). After spin-coating, the devices were moved back to glove box, in which these devices were thermal annealed for 10 min. Finally, a layer of Ag (about 100 nm) was grown by thermal evaporation in a vacuum thermal evaporator through a shadow mask at a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 torr. The active area of the device is about 6.5 mm2.
The current density-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the unencapsulated PSCs were measured with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit using an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel 94021A, 150 W) in air. The illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 irradiation was calibrated using a standard Si photodiode detector (Oriel 91150V) to ensure the accurate light source intensity. All the performance data were averaged over 3 devices.

The UPS spectra (obtained by use of a VG Multilab 2000 instrument) were recorded with a sample bias of −2.0 V in order to observe the secondary electron cutoff. The samples for UPS analysis were handled in a glove box with argon and then moved into a desiccator. The whole assembly was taken out from an argon-filled glove box, and the UPS samples were then transferred quickly (in less than 10 s in air) to the sample loading chamber. Such transferring process would minimize possible influence by an exposure to air.


The SPM (Digital Instrument Nanoscope V) was performed under ambient atmosphere. Rectangular Au tips (Multi75GB, Budget Sensors) with an estimated force constant of 3 N m−1 and resonance frequency of 75 kHz were used in tapping mode for phase images.


The UV-vis absorption of SPAN as thin solid film is shown Fig. 1a, in which the chemical structure of SPAN is also provided in the inset. Three absorption bands are observed in the UV-vis spectra, in which absorption peak at 320 nm is due to π–π* transition of the benzenoid ring, and those at 420 nm and 968 nm are due to polaron band transitions, indicating that SPAN is in the doped state. As to be discussed later, different heat treatment on SPAN thin film can affect the intensity and shape of polaron absorption bands in UV-vis spectra, which is related to concentration and degree of localization for polaron in the SPAN and has influence on the performance of PSC.


Fig. 1b shows the UPS of SPAN thin film. The spectrum width is defined as the distance between the sample inelastic cutoff (at high binding energy region) and the Fermi edge (at low binding energy region) and should be equal to the difference between photon energy of UV source (hν) and sample work function (Φ). In our case, the He I discharge (hν = 21.22 eV) is used as the UV source and spectrum width is 16.13 eV, leading to Φ of 5.09 eV for the SPAN and close to the Φ of PEDOT:PSS (5.1 eV). Therefore, when the SPAN is inserted between active layer and ITO, more efficient hole collecting ability and thus higher PCE can be expected relative to that without HTL (bared ITO) since the values of Φ of SPAN is close to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of P3HT (5.2 eV) as compared to that of ITO (5.02 eV, which is also determined from Fig. 1b). However, the hole collecting ability between SPAN and PEDOT:PSS should have no much difference due to similar value in Φ.
The SPM phase contrast image of SPAN thin film is also investigated in Fig. 2a, and that of PEDOT:PSS is shown in Fig. 2b. In the tapping mode of SPM, the phase lag of the cantilever oscillation, relative to the signal sent to the cantilever piezoelectric driver, is related to local hardness of material at the surface. Hence, the large difference in phase contrast can be assigned to the presence of two different phases in thin film investigated. As can be seen in the Fig. 2, the PEDOT:PSS has much stronger phase contrast than SPAN, indicating that an obvious phase separation exists in PEDOT:PSS. This result can lead to inhomogeneous hole collection for PSC as mentioned in the introduction and thus earlier degradation of PSC performance.
Along with the higher conductivity of SPAN (1.1 × 10−1 S cm−1, this value was determined by four-point probe method) relative to that of PEDOT:PSS (7 × 10−3 S cm−1), it suggests that SPAN can be a promising alternative to PEDOT:PSS as the effective HTL for PSCs and thus higher PCE from the above discussions. However, the lower transmittance of SPAN thin film as compared to PEDOT:PSS may limit its application in c-PSC (Fig. 3), in which the part of transmitted light through the ITO is absorbed by SPAN, resulting in fewer electron-hole pairs generated in the active layer and reduction in PSC performance. In order to overcome the light transmission limitation of SPAN thin film in the application of c-PSC as the HTL, the utilization of solution processable SPAN as the HTL in the i-PSC composed of P3HT:PCBM BHJ is demonstrated, in which the decrease in light intensity due to absorption by SPAN thin film is no longer a problem, and higher PCE relative to that using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL can be expected.

The device structure of i-PSC under investigation is ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM(1:1, w/w)/SPAN/Ag, in which ZnO (60 nm) acts as an electron collecting layer, and related energy levels are shown in Fig. 4a. For comparison purpose, typical device with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL is also fabricated. The surfactant of triton X-100 is added into the aqueous solutions of SPAN and PEDOT:PSS to improve wetting of HTL on the P3HT:PCBM surface (the weight ratio of solid content of SPAN (or PEDOT:PSS) aqueous solution to triton X-100 is 1.5). A summary of the device performances using SPAN or PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and different thermal annealing temperatures is given in Table 1. For i-PSC with SPAN as the HTL, the thermal annealing at 100 °C gives best PCE (3.54 ± 0.11%) along with open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of 0.58 V, 10.34 mA cm−2 and 59.37%, respectively, while the highest PCE (3.30 ± 0.14%) occurs at 140 °C for PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, in which Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.57 V, 10.09 mA cm−2 and 57.05%, respectively. The corresponding J–V plots of the i-PSC with different HTLs at best performance are provided in Fig. 4b. The best PCE of the i-PSC with SPAN exhibits an improvement over that with PEDOT:PSS, which can be attributed to higher conductivity of SPAN (1.1 × 10−1 S cm−1) relative to that of PEDOT:PSS (7 × 10−3 S cm−1) reducing the series resistance of PSC (Rs, it can be determined by the inverse of slope of J–V curve at V = 1). Furthermore, larger shunt resistance of i-PSC (Rsh, it can be calculated by the inverse of slope of J–V curve at V = 0) involved SPAN as the HTL suggests that SPAN has better film quality to reduce leakage current through the device in comparison with PEDOT:PSS, as supported by the SPM phase images of SPAN and PEDOT:PSS shown in Fig. 2. The further decrease in Rs and increase in Rsh by introducing SPAN relative to PEDOT:PSS meet the requirements for an ideal photovoltaic device, indicating that SPAN has the potential to replace PEDOT:PSS as an effective HTL in i-PSC.

It has been reported that the PCE of P3HT:PCBM based BHJ c-PSC can be largely increased from 0.82% to 5% after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min due to increase in the charge-carrier transport and absorption in the active layer. However, in the case of our investigated i-PSC, the thermal treatment on i-PSC contributes little to device improvement. This is because the solvent annealing is employed before the thermal annealing, in which the wet film after spin-coating is stored in a covered glass Petri dishes to allow the solvent to evaporate slowly (about 1 h). This approach can also enhance charge-carrier transport and absorption in the active layer. Therefore, it can be expected that further thermal treatment on solvent annealed i-PSC can not have much improvement on performances. This judgment is further supported by the results reported previously, in which the BHJ c-PSC composed of P3HT:PCBM treated by solvent annealing and that by additional thermal annealing give the PCE 3.52% and 4.37%, respectively. The latter is only higher by a factor of 1.24. In the case of i-PSC utilized SPAN as the HTL, thermal annealing at 100 °C yields the highest PCE (3.54 ± 0.11%). The slightly lower PCE (3.38 ± 0.02%) at 80 °C is possibly due to water residue in the SPAN film degrading the i-PSC performance. When the thermal annealing temperature is increased from 100 °C to 140 °C, the PCE of i-PSC is also decreased gradually (from 3.54 ± 0.11% to 3.13 ± 0.07%). This can be possibly due to decrease in conductivity of SPAN as disclosed by our previous study and also as evidenced by decreased absorbance with temperature in the UV-vis spectra as shown in Fig. 4c. As discussed previously, absorption band at 968 nm is due to polaron band transition. When triton X-100 is added into SPAN, this absorption band (968 nm) is blue-shifted to 880 nm. Furthermore, this absorption peak for SPAN mixed with triton X-100 is narrower than that for pure SPAN. This result would indicate that the planarity of SPAN molecule is disrupted because of the triton X-100 addition, along with more localized polaron than that in pure SPAN. The spectrum does not change for the film annealed at 100 °C, while those annealed at 140 °C is red-shifted back to 968 nm accompanying by a decrease in the intensity of absorption band as compared to that at 100 °C. This reduction in absorption peak intensity could possibly be attributed to occurrence of undoping process (and thus lowering in conductivity) upon thermal annealing, leading to lower PCE of i-PSC observed at 140 °C.
As discussed previously, the lower transmittance of SPAN thin film as compared to that of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 3) may limit its application in c-PSC since the transmittance of SPAN is lower. Fig. 5b shows the J–V plots of the c-PSCs under simulated A.M. 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2 in air, in which HTL of 20 nm (SPAN or PEDOT:PSS) is inserted between ITO and P3HT:PCBM active layer with the device structure ITO/HTL/P3HT:PCBM(1:0.8, w/w)/Ca/Al. The energy level diagram of the materials used in the c-PSC is given in Fig. 5a, taking the energy levels of PEDOT:PSS, P3HT, PCBM, Ca and Al from the previous reports. As expected, by introducing SPAN between ITO and P3HT:PCBM in c-PSC, the Jsc and PCE (9.45 mA cm−2 and 3.78 ± 0.098%) is slightly lower than that with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL (10.14 mA cm−2 and 3.85 ± 0.06%). It would be fair to say that a decrease in the intensity of the reflected light due to absorption by the SPAN in the i-PSC could also reduce performances of i-PSC, however, this effect may not be as significant as one would expect in the c-PSC, as supported by the better PCE observed in the SPAN based i-PSC as compared to that in the PEDOT:PSS based i-PSC. The Rs of c-PSC is smaller in the device fabricated with SPAN (2.42 Ω cm2) than that with PEDOT:PSS (6.16 Ω cm2), and the Rsh of c-PSC is larger in device fabricated with SPAN (1418 Ω cm2) than that of PEDOT:PSS (1279 Ω cm2), which also reflect the higher conductivity and better film quality of SPAN relative to PEDOT:PSS.
The influence of SPAN film thickness on c-PSC performance is also investigated and shown in Fig. 5c. A clear trend of decreasing Jsc with increasing SPAN film thickness can be observed, in which PCEs of c-PSC are 3.65 ± 0.11% (20 nm), 3.04 ± 0.07% (40 nm) and 2.74 ± 0.007% (80 nm), respectively. This result can be due to larger Rs and lower transmittance expected for thicker SPAN film.
In a recent report, a graft copolymer, poly(styrene sulfonic acid) grafted with PAN (PSSA-g-PANI), was synthesized and used as the HTL in P3HT:PCBM based c-PSC, giving the best PCE of 3.99%. However, we think that high content of styrenesulfonic acid (SSA) in PSSA-g-PANI will result in inhomogeneous hole collection as reported for PEDOT:PSS due to conductivity variation by orders of magnitude over different film regions, which could lead to degradation of the long-term stability of c-PSC. Besides, SSA tends to absorb the moisture and this will also lead to degradtion of PSC. We believe the SPAN used in our work can improve the long-term stability of PSC as compared to PEDOT:PSS and PSSA-g-PANI. Further works on the lifetime of PSC with SPAN as the HTL are under progress.

In summary, the utilization of solution processable SPAN as the effective HTL in i-PSC composed of P3HT:PCBM is demonstrated. The PCE of 3.54 ± 0.11% for i-PSC with SPAN as the HTL is superior to that with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL (3.30 ± 0.14%) due to higher conductivity and better film quality of SPAN relative to PEDOT:PSS as disclosed by four-point method and SPM phase images, suggesting that SPAN can be a promising alternative to PEDOT:PSS as the effective HTL for i-PSC. However, the lower transmittance of SPAN thin film as compared to PEDOT:PSS may limit its application in c-PSC. Finally, annealing temperature dependent PCE of SPAN based i-PSC is discussed, in which thermal annealing of SPAN thin film at higher temperature can lead to reduction in device performances, which is possibly due to updoping process and degradation of SPAN occurred at higher temperature.
