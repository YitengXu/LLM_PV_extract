Nowadays, constructing ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) and developing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged as two powerful and efficient means to propel the device efficiency further forward. However, the incorporation of NFAs into a fullerene-based binary PSC to form high-performance donor:fullerene:NFA type ternary PSCs with a thick active layer and large area is still a challenge due to their inferior charge transport properties, complicated blend morphology and unclear aggregation behavior. In this contribution, a new low bandgap NFA (DTCFOIC) based on a fused heptacyclic core (dithienocyclopentafluorene) is developed and blended with a medium bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T to form a binary PSC achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.92%. When a small amount of DTCFOIC was employed as the additional acceptor combined with fullerene-based PC71BM to construct the PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC ternary PSCs, an enhanced PCE of 9.40% was obtained after carefully optimizing the blend composition and the amount of the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) with a thin active layer (100 nm) and normal area (0.04 cm2). This could be mainly attributed to the extended absorption range, improved charge transfer, dissociation and collection properties, and suppressed charge recombination as well as optimized blend morphology in the ternary blend after the addition of NFA and DIO. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of the ternary PSCs could be further optimized to achieve a higher PCE of 10.13% with a thicker active layer (160 nm) and eventually the highest PCE of 10.41% can be achieved with a thick active layer of 190 nm and a large area of 0.1 cm2, which is among the highest efficiencies of both thick layer and large area ternary PSCs. Besides, the ternary PSCs preserved a high PCE over 9% even with a larger active area of 1 cm2 using a thick active layer (172 nm). This observation demonstrates that incorporating a NFA to construct donor:fullerene:NFA type ternary PSCs is a feasible and effective approach to significantly enhance the performance of the resulting ternary system. Meanwhile, our results related to the thick active layer and large area suggest that this ternary system has a promising application prospect for mass manufacturing high-performance PSCs with a roll-to-roll process.

High-performance polymer solar cells (PSCs) are usually fabricated with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, in which the active layer comprises a p-type polymer donor and a fullerene-based or non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) to form a bi-continuous interpenetrating network for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The active layer of BHJ PSCs commonly has to be very thin (∼100 nm) to ensure efficient charge collection because both the polymer donor and fullerene-based acceptor or NFA generally possess relatively low charge carrier mobility as compared with Si-based inorganic semiconductors. Such a thin film restricted light absorption and hence limited the photocurrent and overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. Therefore, to overcome the absorption limitation of PSCs, various strategies are currently in the exploration stage. For example, developing tandem solar cells which consist of multiple sub-cells with different bandgaps and complementary absorption in a cascade configuration has been proved to be an effective and potential approach for enhancing the light harvesting ability. Very recently, Forrest's group reported a tandem solar cell with the champion PCE over 15%. Encouragingly, a remarkable PCE of 17.36% was reported for a 2-terminal (2T) monolithic tandem organic solar cell, where NFA incorporated with fullerene-based derivative as acceptors. However, the fabrication cost and difficulty also obviously increase due to its complicated multilayer assembly procedure, which makes its practical application difficult. Inspired by tandem solar cells, introducing some suitable complementary absorbers into typical binary active layers to form ternary PSCs has been emerging as one of the most promising alternatives to propel the PCE forward while maintaining simple device fabrication similar to binary systems. A typical ternary PSC consists of a polymer donor and two electron acceptors. Compared with the corresponding binary counterpart, the second electron acceptor or the additional acceptor is commonly selected to increase or extend the light absorption of its binary host. Elaborately selecting the additional acceptor and tailoring the blend composition as well as optimizing the device fabrication technology allow us to simultaneously increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of ternary PSCs because the additional acceptor plays a key role in improving light harvesting and the blend film morphology, facilitating charge transport and exciton dissociation.

In the past three years, ternary PSCs with two electron acceptors have exhibited great potential for the achievement of high PCE due to the rapid progress in highly efficient NFAs. Compared to fullerene-based acceptors, like phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, Fig. 1a), NFAs have many advantages, such as strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared region, superior morphological stability in blend films, various structural modifications, and easily tunable absorption and electron energy levels. According to the different possible combinations of two electron acceptors in ternary PSCs, we can divide them into three categories: (i) donor:fullerene1:fullerene2; (ii) donor:fullerene:NFA; (iii) donor:NFA1:NFA2. As for donor:NFA1:NFA2 type ternary PSCs, Yan and co-workers lately reported a ternary PSC system with a donor polymer (PM6) and two structurally similar non-fullerene acceptors (ITCPTC and MeIC). As a result, the optimal blend ratio of PM6:ITCPTC:MeIC (1:0.4:0.6) resulted in an impressive FF of 78.2% and PCE of 14.13%, which are the highest values reported for ternary non-fullerene PSCs reported to date. Nevertheless, among these three categories, donor:fullerene:NFA type ternary PSCs are regarded as the most attractive one because they combine many of the advantages of both fullerene-based acceptors and NFAs. Here, we summarized the recent progress in high-performance (PCE > 9%) donor:fullerene:NFA type ternary PSCs as shown in Table 1. In most cases, the improved PCE (PCE*) of ternary PSCs is in the range of 10–30% relative to the corresponding binary PSCs. These results demonstrate that this kind of ternary PSC is effective in further enhancing the photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, there are only two cases where the PCE* of ternary PSCs increased by more than 30%. This means that it needs more effort to remarkably improve the photovoltaic performance of NFA-based ternary PSCs. Besides fine tuning the blend composition of ternary systems, another key issue is to select a suitable NFA for high-performance ternary PSCs. In ternary PSCs, it has been demonstrated that the introduction of NFAs has many advantages, such as tunable absorption, small voltage loss and high Voc, and enhanced stability. Currently, the most popular and effective molecular motif for NFAs possesses an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) skeleton, which consists of a multifused ladder-type electron-donating core (D) and two strong electron-deficient terminal acceptor units (A). A–D–A type NFAs with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as the terminal A unit have exhibited the best performance until now due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the terminal A unit, providing a reduced bandgap and compact structure for molecular packing, and have been widely adopted in developing high-performance PSCs.

Nowadays, with the rapid progress in both new materials (new polymer donors and NFAs) and device engineering (device structure and fabrication technology), PCEs of over 13% have been achieved in PSCs. In 2017, the Hou group reported organic tandem solar cells based on two polymer:NFA subcells with the highest PCE up to 13.8%. Very recently, this group developed a high-performance PSC (PCE > 13%) by enhancing the intramolecular electron push–pull effect of a fluorinated NFA. Nonetheless, most of the champion devices were prepared with an active layer thickness of ≈100 nm because of the relatively low charge mobility of the organic materials in PSCs. Furthermore, it is more difficult to achieve high-performance ternary PSCs with a thick active layer (>200 nm), mainly due to the increased complexity of the active layer morphology by adding the third component. This made it challenging to form effective charge transport paths in ternary blend films. The thin active layer greatly limited not only the utilization of incident light but also the practical application of ternary PSCs in the high-throughput roll-to-roll (R2R) process, where thick active layers beyond 200 nm are usually required to fabricate uniform and pinhole-free large area films at high printing rates. In recent reports, some PSCs employed neat fullerene derivative PC71BM as an acceptor and achieved high PCEs with thick active layers, highlighting its practical application potential in high-performance ternary organic solar cells. Though NFAs show greater potential than fullerene-based acceptors, high-performance ternary PSCs incorporating NFAs with a thick active layer (around 200 nm) have seldom been reported (see Table 1). Apart from the active layer thickness, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is also closely related to the active area. Generally, the PCE is decreased with the increase of the active area. The reasons for the performance drop can be ascribed to the increased sheet resistance of indium tin oxide (ITO) and difficulty in optimizing the morphology of the large-area BHJ film, which lead to the reduction of Jsc and FF of devices. Nevertheless, most of the reported high-performance PSCs achieved their optimal performance with a relatively small active area (∼0.04 cm2). A thick active layer and large active area are highly desired in future large scale R2R fabrication for the practical application of PSCs. Son and Zhang groups recently reported highly efficient fullerene-based and non-fullerene binary PSCs, respectively, with both a thick active layer and large area (>0.2 cm2). However, as far as we know, high-performance ternary PSCs (PCE > 10%) incorporating NFAs with both a thick active layer and large area have never been reported (see Table 1).
New NFA materials need to be further exploited to closely follow well-developed polymer donor materials, causing a continuous improvement in the PCEs of binary non-fullerene PSCs. In this contribution, we firstly developed a novel A–D–A type NFA (DTCFOIC) with ladder-type heptacyclic arene dithienocyclopentafluorene as the central D unit and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as the terminal A unit (Fig. 1a). Then a medium bandgap polymer PBDB-T (Fig. 1a) was selected as the donor combined with the DTCFOIC acceptor to fabricate binary non-fullerene PSCs. The optimized binary PSCs based on PBDB-T:DTCFOIC exhibit a PCE of 6.92%, which is comparable with that of the corresponding fullerene-based binary PSCs with PC71BM as the acceptor (PCE = 6.98%). This result implies that DTCFOIC could be used as a promising NFA for efficient non-fullerene PSCs. At the same time, binary PSCs based on DTCFOIC show a higher Voc of 1 V compared with PC71BM-based binary PSCs (Voc = 0.89 V), due to the slightly higher LUMO energy level of DTCFOIC. On the other hand, PC71BM-based binary PSCs exhibit a relatively high FF of 68.68%. To make full use of the merits of the two acceptors (PC71BM and DTCFOIC), donor:fullerene:NFA type ternary PSCs (see Fig. 1b) were finally prepared with PBDB-T as the donor, and PC71BM and DTCFOIC as the fullerene-based acceptor and NFA, respectively, in view of their stepwise HOMO/LUMO energy level alignments and complementary absorption bands, as shown in Fig. 2. The component proportion and morphology of the ternary blends were finely manipulated to explore the effects of the NFA (DTCFOIC) and the process additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) on the device performance. The optimal ternary PSCs deliver the highest PCEs of 10.13% and 10.41% with an active area of 0.04 cm2 and large area of 0.1 cm2 using thicker active layers, respectively, both of which are remarkably higher than those of binary devices based on both polymer:PC71BM (6.98%) and polymer:DTCFOIC (6.92%). Here, it is worth mentioning that such a large enhancement in PCE compared to the reference binary devices (over 45% higher than both the DTCFOIC-based device and the PC71BM-based device) has seldom been accomplished before. Besides, the ternary PSCs preserved a high PCE over 9% even with a larger active area of 1 cm2 using a thicker active layer (172 nm). On a separate note, high-performance ternary PSCs were achieved with relatively thick active layers (∼200 nm). Our study indicates the feasibility of employing NFAs combined with fullerene-based acceptors to construct high-performance thick layer and large area ternary PSCs for the first time by carefully choosing a perfect combination of the polymer donor and acceptors, finely optimizing the component proportion, and systematically tuning the morphology, which would greatly boost the development of thick layer and large area ternary PSCs to accomplish the requirements of the future R2R process.

The chemical structures of PBDB-T, PC71BM, and DTCFOIC are displayed in Fig. 1. PBDB-T and PC71BM were obtained via a commercial approach. The synthetic route to the novel A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptor DTCFOIC with heptacyclic arene dithienocyclopentafluorene (DTCF) as the D unit and IC as the A unit is depicted in Scheme S1 of the ESI. The experimental details are described in the ESI. The chemical structures of important intermediates and the target molecule were characterized and confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF-MS. DTCFOIC possesses good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene (CB), because of the four 4-hexyloxyphenyl bulky substituents together with two octyl side-chains. Notably, the four 4-hexyloxyphenyl substituents are the big difference between DTCFOIC and other previously reported NFAs based on the DTCF core, which ultimately brings benefits to absorption properties and electronic energy levels, such as a red-shifted absorption spectrum, a reduced optical bandgap, lowered energy levels compared to a similar NFA with hexylphenyl or octyl substituents.

The thermal stability of DTCFOIC was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI, TGA reveals that DTCFOIC has excellent thermal stability with an onset decomposition temperature corresponding to 5% weight loss (Td) as high as 362 °C. At the same time, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, see Fig. S3 in the ESI) was carried out to study the solid-state thermal transition of DTCFOIC. DSC analysis demonstrates that a visible crystallization thermal transition was not observed in the first cooling scan, even when the sample was cooled slowly. However, a clear endothermic peak appears at 192 °C in the second heating scan, corresponding to a cooling crystallization temperature T′c. The phenomenon of cooling crystallization increases the aggregation of both side chains and the molecular backbone, resulting in an obvious endothermic peak at a high temperature of 282 °C (Tm). This result suggests that DTCFOIC has a good tendency to form crystalline aggregates even when the four 4-hexyloxyphenyl bulky groups are spread out of the conjugated plane of the DTCF backbone.

The UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PBDB-T, PC71BM, and DTCFOIC films are shown in Fig. 2a. One can see that DTCFOIC in the film exhibits a strong absorption band mainly located in the low-energy region in the range from 500 to 750 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 684 nm. A low optical bandgap of 1.69 eV can be obtained from the absorption onset (731 nm) of the solid film. The medium bandgap polymer PBDB-T displays a wide photon harvesting range mainly covering the middle-energy region (450–650 nm) with a strong absorption plateau in the range of 550–640 nm. The strong absorption band of the fullerene-based acceptor PC71BM is mainly located in a high-energy region (<500 nm). These results reveal that the polymer donor and the two acceptors have good complementary absorption properties covering the whole UV-vis region, which means great potential for achieving highly efficient ternary PSCs with a high Jsc by finely tailoring the components of the ternary blend system. To further elaborate this issue, we also measured the UV-vis absorption spectra of the two binary systems (PBDB-T:DTCFOIC and PBDB-T:PC71BM) and ternary system (PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC) as shown in Fig. 2b. Clearly, the ternary blend film PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC (1:1.5:0.2, by weight) possesses an obviously broader light-harvesting range than the two binary blend films, which indicates that the ternary PSCs would deliver higher Jsc than the binary ones.

The redox behavior of the NFA DTCFOIC was investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements as shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of DTCFOIC are calculated to be −5.63 and −3.93 eV, respectively, according to the onsets of the oxidation and reduction potentials in CV. Both HOMO and LUMO energy levels are higher-lying than those of PC71BM (−6.10 and −4.20 eV), but lower-lying than those of the polymer donor PBDB-T (−5.33 and −2.92 eV). Meanwhile, these energy levels are slightly lower compared to those of a similar NFA with hexylphenyl or octyl substituents on the central D unit (DTCF), which is consistent with the previously observed results. Obviously, the energy levels of the NFA DTCFOIC are just located between the polymer donor PBDB-T and fullerene-based acceptor PC71BM. It could be possible for these three components to form energy level alignment (see Fig. 2c), which guarantees efficient exciton dissociation and transportation. Moreover, the uplifted LUMO energy level of DTCFOIC relative to PC71BM implies that the binary PBDB-T:DTCFOIC device would exhibit a higher Voc than the PBDB-T:PC71BM device because the Voc of the BHJ device is usually proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the polymer donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.

An inverted BHJ architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al was applied to investigate the photovoltaic performance of both the binary and ternary PSCs under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), where ITO is indium tin oxide, ZnO is zinc oxide and MoO3 is molybdenum oxide. The active layers were fabricated by spin-coating the solution of each D:A (D = PBDB-T, A = PC71BM and/or DTCFOIC) blend in chlorobenzene (CB) with or without additive for binary and ternary systems. At first, we investigated the photovoltaic performance of the binary PSCs and the detailed device performances are collected in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI. The optimal binary PSC based on PBDB-T:PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 6.98% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 11.4 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.7% (see Table 2) with a D:A weight ratio of 1:1.5, which is comparable with the previously reported value. On the other hand, the binary PSC based on PBDB-T:DTCFOIC delivered a comparably high PCE of 6.92% with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 11.93 mA cm−2, and a FF of 57.9% (see Table 2), which was achieved with a D:A weight ratio of 1:1.5 and thermal annealing treatment (130 °C for 10 min) of the active layer. Comparing the two binary PSCs, one can see that fullerene-based devices exhibit a relatively high FF whereas non-fullerene-based devices give a higher Voc. The former can be ascribed to the superior charge carrier properties of the PBDB-T:PC71BM blend and the latter can be attributed to the elevated LUMO energy level of the NFA DTCFOIC with respect to PC71BM.

In view of the good complementary absorption (Fig. 2a) and cascade-like energy levels (Fig. 2c) of the three materials, donor:fullerene:NFA type ternary PSCs (PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC) were constructed in order to take full advantage and overcome the disadvantages of fullerene- and non-fullerene-based binary PSCs. In these ternary PSCs, DTCFOIC was employed to extend the light absorption (Jsc), whereas PC71BM was used to preserve the high FF in ternary blends due to its high electron mobility. The photovoltaic performance of ternary PSCs was systematically optimized by changing the weight ratio of the components and the processing conditions. To find which is the host acceptor in the ternary device, we initially inspect the effect of the different ratio of PC71BM to DTCFOIC on the device performance by fixing the D:A (A = PC71BM + DTFCOIC) ratio at 1:1.6. As shown in Table S3, when the feed ratio of PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC is 1:1.5:0.1, an improved PCE of 7.92% was obtained for the ternary device compared with the corresponding binary device of PBDB-T:PC71BM, whereas, an obviously reduced PCE of 4.58% was achieved relative to the DTCFOIC-based binary system when the feed ratio of PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC is changed to 1:0.1:1.5. These primary results indicate that PC71BM is more suitable as the host acceptor and DTCFOIC can be used as an effective additional acceptor. Next, by fixing the polymer donor to PC71BM ratio at 1:1.5, we carefully screened the variation in ternary device performance along with changing the content of DTCFOIC. As shown in Table S3 in the ESI, when the weight ratio of DTCFOIC in the ternary system was increased from 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.3, the performance of the ternary devices increased (PCE = 8.14%) at first and decreased (PCE = 6.93%) at last. Accordingly, the optimal feed ratio for the ternary system PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC was determined to be 1:1.5:0.2. Since the processing solvent additive, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), has been demonstrated to optimize the morphology of the active layer and the resulting photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we scanned the content of DIO to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the ternary system. From Fig. 3a and Table S3 in the ESI, one can find that the additive DIO has a great effect on the performance of the ternary PSCs. When a small amount (0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3%, by volume) of DIO was added, the Jsc can be improved remarkably, resulting in enhanced PCEs even though the Voc and FF decreased to some extent. Ultimately, when 0.5% (by volume) DIO was added as an additive, a maximum PCE of 9.40% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 15.96 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.0% was obtained for ternary PSCs under the optimized feed ratio and a 100 nm active layer thickness (see Table 2). The improved performance of the ternary PSCs could be mainly attributed to the significantly improved Jsc and preserved high FF. The best current density–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic data of both binary and ternary PSCs with an active area of 0.04 cm2 are displayed in Fig. 3b and Table 2, respectively.
As mentioned earlier, besides high efficiency, a thick active layer and large area are highly desired for large-scale production of PSCs. Therefore, we further explored the relationship between the ternary device performance and different processing conditions such as the active layer thickness and area. Fig. 3c describes the relationship between the performance and active layer thickness and detailed device parameters of the ternary PSCs with difference active layer thicknesses are summarized in Table 2 and Table S4 in the ESI. The active layer thickness was controlled by varying the overall content of the ternary composition with the optimal feed ratio and the active area was first fixed to be 0.04 cm2. The ternary PSCs with the different active layer thicknesses exhibited slightly varied Voc values of 0.86–0.88 V and a big change of both Jsc and FF, which indicate that the active layer thickness has a more significant effect on both Jsc and FF than Voc. Thin active layers of 88 and 100 nm showed the highest FF of 67.0% and a relatively low Jsc of 15.34 and 15.06 mA cm−2, delivering good PCEs of 8.90% and 9.40% (see Fig. 3c), respectively. A thicker active layer of 150 nm could increase Jsc but obviously decrease FF meanwhile, resulting in a comparable PCE of 9.19%. When the active layer thickness was further increased to 160 nm, the highest Jsc of 18.46 mA cm−2 and a good FF of 63.3% could be achieved, affording the best PCE of 10.13%. The improved Jsc and reduced FF for a thicker active layer should be attributed to the enhanced light absorption and the increased complexity of the active layer morphology, respectively, which agrees with other previous observations. The PSC with a 260 nm thick active layer also showed a good PCE of 8.45%, despite the remarkably decreased FF. The result means that the device efficiency for the ternary PSCs is less sensitive to the active layer thickness from 88 to 260 nm (see Fig. 3c).
The fact that the device efficiency for ternary PSCs is slightly sensitive to the active layer thickness inspires us to inspect the photovoltaic performance of larger area ternary PSCs, which were seldom focused in previous reports. Larger area ternary PSCs with active areas of 0.1, 0.2, and 1 cm2 were fabricated with the same device structure and preparation conditions as used for small area (0.04 cm2) devices. The best J–V curve of the ternary PSCs with a relatively thicker active thickness (>160 nm) and different active areas is depicted in Fig. 3d. The detailed device data are also listed in Table 2 and Table S4 in the ESI. With a similar active layer thickness, e.g. ∼100 nm, the Jsc of the ternary PSCs increases first (16.84 mA cm−2) and then decreases slightly (15.07 mA cm−2); the FF is generally decreased, while the Voc is relatively well conserved when the active area is increased from 0.04 to 1.0 cm2. The reduction in FF could be ascribed to the sheet resistance of the ITO film. Additionally, it can be found that the photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs based on thicker active layers (>160 nm) showed a similar trend of change to those based on thinner active layers (∼100 nm). At the same time, we also explored the impact of different active layer thicknesses on the performance of devices with a large active area as shown in Fig. 3c and Table S4 in the ESI. Finally, the ternary PSCs with a larger device area of 0.1 cm2 afforded the best PCE of 10.41% and the highest Jsc of 18.56 mA cm−2 with a thicker active layer (190 nm). Moreover, encouraging PCEs of 9.14% and 9.21% were still achieved with a thicker active layer (>170 nm) when the active area is further increased to 0.2 and 1 cm2, respectively. Notably, the PCEs of the ternary PSCs with different device areas are also slightly sensitive to active layer thicknesses (see Table S4 in the ESI). Overall, with the device area increasing from 0.04 to 1 cm2, the ternary devices based on thinner active layers (∼100 nm) or thicker active layers (>160 nm) exhibited the maximum PCE over 9%. These results related to active layer thickness and area demonstrate that this ternary system is promising for manufacturing large-area devices with a R2R process.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs were recorded to confirm the measured Jsc values from J–V curves. Fig. 3e and S5 in the ESI describe the EQE curves of the corresponding PSCs based on the two binary and ternary systems (PCE = 8.14% and 9.40%) and the best PCEs of ternary systems with different active areas, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3e, compared with PBDB-T:DTCFOIC-based PSCs, PBDB-T:PC71BM-based binary PSCs have higher EQE values in the short-wavelength range of 300–600 nm, while lower EQE values in the long-wavelength range of 600–750 nm. Moreover, PBDB-T:DTCFOIC binary PSCs and all ternary PSCs display obviously broader EQE spectral response ranges than those based on PBDB-T:PC71BM, indicating that the DTCFOIC could significantly extend the photoresponse in the long-wavelength range. These observations are consistent with the absorption spectra (Fig. 2b). Compared with the two binary PSCs, the EQE curves of the ternary PSCs have profiles featuring the combination of the two binary systems, revealing that all of the three compositions have rather contribution to the photocurrent of the ternary PSCs even when there is an obviously small amount of DTCFOIC. For the ternary PSCs, the overall EQE values were substantially higher than those of both PBDB-T:DTCFOIC and PBDB-T:PC71BM, meaning that more photogenerated excitons in the active layer were dissociated to free charges and collected by the electrodes. In addition, for the ternary PSC without DIO, the EQE spectrum exhibits relatively high values over 60% in the region of 400–650 nm. After 0.5% DIO was added as an additive, the EQE values in a wider region of 350–680 nm were over 60% and a maximum value of 75% was recorded at 560 nm. This suggests that the additive of DIO has a great influence on the aggregation state of DTCFOIC in the ternary blend films. The maximum EQE value of the ternary PSCs with or without DIO is higher than those of the two binary PSCs, demonstrating that the photo-electron conversion process is more efficient in the ternary PSCs. Meanwhile, from Fig. S5 in the ESI one can find that the EQE values can be further improved in the whole photoresponse range with the highest value even exceeding 85%, which agrees with the obviously higher Jsc values of ternary PSCs with a thick active layer and different active areas (see Table 2). Overall, the calculated photocurrent densities (Jcal., Table 2) from the integration of the EQE spectra are in good accord with the measured Jsc values from J–V curves within the reasonable error of 5%.

The photoluminescence (PL) quenching spectrum was used to study the photoinduced charge transfer behavior of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PL spectra excited at 680 nm for the pristine DTCFOIC and blend films were recorded to estimate the charge transfer from DTCFOIC to PBDB-T. The pristine DTCFOIC film shows an intense and broad emission band in the region of 700–950 nm with an emission peak at about 780 nm. After fixing with PBDB-T to form a binary system, the PL peak of DTCFOIC was significantly quenched, indicating that there is efficient charge transfer from the polymer donor PBDB-T to the NFA DTCFOIC. The PL peak of DTCFOIC could be further quenched in the ternary blend films, which implies that DTCFOIC also worked well with PBDB-T in the ternary system. Likewise, one can find that more effective quenching occurred in the ternary blend film processed with 0.5% DIO than that without DIO, demonstrating that the ternary system containing two acceptors of DTCFOIC and PC71BM was more favorable to facilitate charge transfer from the polymer donor to the acceptors and sweep out the dissociated charge carriers. A previous report revealed that the distinct domain size of DTCFOIC can be optimized by varying the DIO content, reflecting the variation of emission intensity of DTCFOIC in the ternary films. The strongest quenching for the ternary blend film processed with 0.5% DIO demonstrates that well dispersed DTCFOIC was formed, resulting in an ideal film morphology as discussed in the following section. This benefits the improvement in Jsc, which is in accordance with the increased Jsc in previous ternary PSCs.

Next, in order to investigate the charge transport properties in devices, we measured the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of binary and ternary blend films with the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method by utilizing hole-only and electron-only device structures, respectively (Fig. 4b and c). Hole-only and electron-only devices were prepared with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b and c and Table 3, both the μh and μe values of the binary blend PBDB-T:PC71BM are higher than those of PBDB-T:DTCFOIC, which should be one of the reasons for the higher FF of the former than the latter in PSCs. The μe values of the two binary blends and ternary blend with 0% DIO have the same order of magnitude (PBDB-T:PC71BM: 2.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, PBDB-T:DTCFOIC: 1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC: 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Nevertheless, the μh values of the binary blends (PBDB-T:PC71BM: 6.44 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PBDB-T:DTCFOIC: 6.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) are obviously lower than that of the ternary blend with 0% DIO (PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC: 1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This finding indicates that the hole-transport ability of DTCFOIC is good and the incorporation of some amount of DTCFOIC into the PBDB-T:PC71BM system to form a ternary PSC is an efficient strategy to improve the hole mobility of devices. Moreover, the ratio of electron to hole mobilities of the ternary blend without DIO (μe/μh = 2.15) is smaller than that of the binary PBDB-T:PC71BM blend (μe/μh = 3.23), which implies that the ternary system has relatively balanced charge mobilities, ensuring a relatively high FF and Jsc in the ternary PSCs. Interestingly, from Table 3 one can find that the μh and μe values of the ternary blend processed with 0.5% DIO were calculated to be 1.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are almost 1.5 times and 72% higher than those of the ternary blend without DIO (μh = 1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively. This means that DIO has a greater impact on the electron mobility in contrast to the hole mobility for the ternary system. Meanwhile, the results also indicated that the processing conditions mainly affect the transport properties of the acceptors in the ternary PSCs.

In addition to the charge transfer and transport properties, the Jsc and FF are also closely related to the charge recombination, generation and dissociation in BHJ films. Therefore, we subsequently examined the Voc and Jsc as a function of the natural logarithm of light intensity (Plight) (Fig. 5a and b) to investigate the charge recombination in the fabricated binary and ternary PSCs. Firstly, we explored the dependence of Voc on Plight for the two binary and ternary PSCs with 0.5% DIO as shown in Fig. 5a. The linear relationship of the Voc dependence on Plight can be expressed as: Voc ∝ lnPlight with a slope of nkT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. As we all know, a slope of 1kT/q indicates bimolecular recombination in the active layer, while a slope of 2kT/q indicates that monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination should be the dominant charge loss mechanism. As described in Fig. 5a, the relatively lower slopes of 1.31 and 1.16kT/q were fitted for the binary PBDB-T:PC71BM- and ternary PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC-based PSCs, respectively, compared with the binary PBDB-T:DTCFOIC-based PSCs (slope = 1.42kT/q), suggesting that trap-assisted recombination can be efficiently suppressed in the first two devices, thus resulting in relatively high FF values (see Table 2). The lowest slope of 1.16kT/q for the ternary PSCs with 0.5% reveals that bimolecular recombination should be the main recombination process after the incorporation of a small amount of DTCFOIC as the additional acceptor to form ternary PSCs. To further examine the extent of bimolecular recombination in those devices, we also measured the dependence of Jsc on Plight, described as Jsc ∝ Plightα (Fig. 5b), where α stands for the extent of bimolecular recombination. When all the carriers are swept out before bimolecular recombination, the calculated α value should be equal to 1, while α < 1 represents the existence of charge recombination. According to the fitting results, the two binary and the ternary PSCs with 0.5% DIO exhibited α values of 0.873, 0.867, and 0.924, respectively, which implies that bimolecular recombination is mainly suppressed in the ternary PSCs.

Finally, we measured the plots of the photocurrent density versus the effective voltage (Jph–Veff) of the two binary and ternary PSCs with 0.5% DIO (see Fig. 5c) to study the charge generation, dissociation and charge collection process. Here Jph is described as Jph = JL − JD, where JL stands for the current density under light and JD represents the current density in the dark. Veff is estimated by V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which JL is equal to JD, and V is the applied voltage. One can see from Fig. 5c that Jph reached a saturated state (Jsat) at large reverse bias (Veff = 2 V), at which point all of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs can be effectively dissociated into free charge carriers and collected enough by electrodes. An obviously higher Jsat value of 20.52 mA cm−2 can be obtained for the ternary PSCs based on PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC with 0.5% DIO as compared with the binary PSCs based on PBDB-T:DTCFOIC (14.73 mA cm−2) and PBDB-B:PC71BM (16.09 mA cm−2), agreeing with the Jsc values measured from J–V curves. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs with DTCFOIC as the additional acceptor display a remarkably higher Jsat value than the two binary PSCs, demonstrating more efficient exciton generation and dissociation in the ternary system. The charge dissociation efficiency can be assessed by the charge collection probability [P(E, T)]. The value of [P(E, T)] at any bias is determined from the plot of the normalized photocurrent density (Jph/Jsat) with respect to Veff as shown in Fig. 5c. Under short-circuit conditions, the [P(E, T)] values for the two binary PSCs of PBDB-T:DTCFOIC and PBDB-B:PC71BM were calculated to be 0.814 and 0.827, respectively, while a higher [P(E, T)] value of 0.880 was obtained for the ternary PSCs with 0.5% DIO, meaning the higher charge dissociation efficiency at the donor/acceptor interfaces in the ternary PSCs. The results imply that the minute incorporation of DTCFOIC could also effectively facilitate charge dissociation and collection. All in all, the increased charge dissociation and collection properties as well as suppressed charge recombination can be responsible for the improvement of Jsc, FF, and ultimate PCE for the ternary PSCs with 0.5% DIO.

To further investigate the effects of the additional acceptor DTCFOIC and the additive DIO on the photovoltaic performance, the film morphology of the active layers based on binary and ternary blend films was characterized using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. As described in Fig. 6a and e, the binary blend film of PBDB-T:PC71BM delivered a small-length scale phase separation morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (Rq) of 2.40 nm, while the binary PBDB-T:DTCFOIC blend film showed a relatively large phase-separated domain size with a slightly bigger RMS value of 2.56 nm (Fig. 6b and f). The large phase separation in the blend film affected exciton dissociation and charge transfer and transport and led to a lower FF in the PBDB-T:DTCFOIC-based PSC with respect to the PBDB-T:PC71BM one as recorded in Table 2. After incorporation of a small amount of DTCFOIC into the binary blend system, smaller domain sizes and a relatively uniform surface can be observed in the ternary PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC film (see Fig. 6c and g) relative to both the binary blend films. Smooth surfaces with a reduced RMS roughness value of 1.76 nm were obtained, which is smaller than that of both the PBDB-T:PC71BM and PBDB-T:PC71BM binary blend films. By addition of 0.5% DIO as the additive, more smooth surfaces and a rather uniform film featuring well-distributed nanofibrils were observed for the ternary blend film (see Fig. 6d and h). The RMS roughness value was further decreased to 1.51 nm. The smooth and fibrous morphology in ternary films implies that the minute addition of DTCFOIC and DIO could induce the polymer and acceptors to aggregate in a more appropriate domain size and make the interface between the donor and acceptor more uniform, which is beneficial for facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport as well as restraining charge recombination. The improved film morphology of the ternary blend films without or with 0.5% DIO can well explain their higher Jsc and FF values as discussed before.

The increased molecular ordering of the ternary blend films has been verified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. S6 in the ESI). As seen from the XRD patterns in Fig. S6 in the ESI, visible diffraction peaks located at 2θ of 4.16° and 4.50° are observed for the binary PBDB-T:PC71BM and PBDB-T:DTCFOIC, respectively, corresponding to a d100-spacing of 21.2 Å and 19.6 Å, respectively. Notably, a more distinct and sharper diffraction peak (100) at 2θ = 4.61° with respect to the both binary blend films can still be clearly seen in the ternary PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC blend film. This observation indicated that better structural ordering and well-defined structure have formed in such ternary blend films processed with DIO, which should be beneficial for charge transport, and hence increase carrier mobilities, Jsc, as well as FF in ternary PSCs.

Besides high PCEs, device stability is another key issue for the practical application of high-performance PSCs. However, this is seldom considered in the reported ternary PSCs. Herein, we investigated the thermal stability and long-term stability of the optimized ternary device (0.5% DIO). At first, the thermal stability is assessed by examining the performance at one high annealing temperature (e.g. 120 °C) with different times. As shown in Fig. 7a, the optimized ternary device exhibited relatively good thermal stability. The PCE (4.54%) dropped almost in half of the initial efficiency (9.17%) after annealing for 60 h at 120 °C. Moreover, the PCE retained ∼45% of the initial value even after annealing for 80 h at 120 °C. The photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, FF, and PCE, reduced gradually with increasing thermal treatment time, while the Jsc value first decreased then increased and finally decreased obviously (see Fig. S7 and Table S5 in the ESI).

Then, the thermal stability test is performed at various temperatures ranging from 40 °C to 150 °C for five 5-minute periods in an inert atmosphere. For comparison, this test was carried out on four different devices (devices 1–4) fabricated under the same conditions at the same time. The photovoltaic performances of these four devices are described in Fig. 7b and c and summarized in Table S6 in the ESI. The performance continuously degraded with the increase of heating temperature. In particular, the PCE preserved over 90% of the initial efficiency upon annealing at 100 °C (see Fig. 7b). However, the PCE declined greatly (<80% of the initial value) when the temperature increased up to 120 °C, which mainly results from the severe reduction of both Jsc and FF. Furthermore, the device can retain over 70% of the PCE from the original value even after exposure to elevated temperatures up to 150 °C. For example, device 3 exhibited a PCE as high as 8.17% (91% of the initial value) after annealing at 100 °C. Then the PCE reduced sharply to 6.78% (76% of the initial value) at 120 °C and the device still retained 73% of the PCE (6.57%) from the original value even when the temperature further increased up to 150 °C (see Fig. 7b, c, and Table S6). In addition, as shown in Fig. 7c, the Voc and FF values of this device increased first and then decreased with increasing the annealing temperature, whereas the Jsc value declined continuously. Ultimately, the Voc losses are rather negligible for all four devices (around 2%), while Jsc and FF decreased significantly with 10–15% losses after annealing at 150 °C (see Table S6 in the ESI). To seek the cause of thermally induced degradation of the photovoltaic performance, an investigation of the blend film microstructure with AFM under various thermal treatment conditions (60, 100, and 120 °C) was performed. As shown in Fig. S8a–c in the ESI, compared to the original blend film without thermal-annealing treatment (see Fig. 6d), the blend films displayed a large scale phase separation morphology with increased roughness values of 3.24, 3.35, and 3.54 nm for the annealing temperature of 60, 100, and 120 °C, respectively. This result indicates that the thermally induced coarse film morphology with larger aggregates occurred in the blend film at elevated temperature, and became more serious after processing from 100 °C to 120 °C (Fig. S8d–f in the ESI), which is deleterious for the exciton dissociation and charge transfer in devices and eventually results in greatly reduced Jsc and FF in the blend film treated at 120 °C.
Finally, the long-term stability of the optimized ternary device was also examined at room temperature under inert conditions for 300 h without encapsulation (Fig. 7d and Table S7 in the ESI). The Voc, Jsc, and FF values of the device remained 97%, 89%, and 93%, respectively, from their initial values, even after an extended time of 300 h, maintaining ∼80% of the PCE from the original value, which means that the optimal ternary device possessed good stability after 300 h. Overall, the device stability of ternary PSCs is certainly more subtle than originally expected and should be recommended for more attention and in-depth investigations to develop better detailed insight on the morphological changes during degradation.

In summary, a new A–D–A type small molecule (DTCFOIC) with heptacyclic arene dithienocyclopentafluorene (DTCF) as the D unit was synthesized and characterized for application as a NFA used in BHJ PSCs. DTCFOIC has a broader absorption band, a lower bandgap and deeper-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels as compared with the reported analogues. This new NFA is employed as the additional acceptor combined with a medium bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T (donor) and a fullerene-based acceptor PC71BM to form a donor:fullerene:NFA type ternary PSC due to their complementary absorption and matched HOMO/LUMO energy alignments. The optimized BHJ PSCs with an inverted structure exhibit PCEs of 6.98% and 6.92% for the binary PBDB-T:PC71BM and PBDB-T:DTCFOIC systems, respectively. Based on the efficient binary PSCs, a series of ternary PSCs are fabricated with different active layer thicknesses and areas. By optimizing the content of DTCFOIC and amount of additive DIO, the ternary PSCs deliver an improved PCE of 10.13% with 0.5% DIO using a thicker active layer (160 nm) and a small area (0.04 cm2) when the PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC weight ratio is 1:1.5:0.2. Especially, when the active layer area increased to be 0.1 cm2, a higher PCE of 10.41% can be achieved with an active layer thickness of 190 nm, which is the highest value for single-active layer ternary PSCs based on both a thick active layer and large area. An over 40% PCE improvement is achieved in comparison with PC71BM and DTCFOIC based binary PSCs, mainly due to the significantly increased Jsc and maintained high FF. It has been demonstrated that such a great enhancement in the efficiency of ternary PSCs arises from the improved film morphology, charge transfer, dissociation and collection properties, and suppressed charge combination, as well as balanced electron/hole transport after introducing DTCFOIC and processing with 0.5% DIO of the active layer. In particular, a high PCE over 9% can still be achieved in the ternary PSCs even with a larger active area of 1.0 cm2 using a thicker active layer (172 nm). Apart from the promising device efficiency, the optimal ternary device exhibited both good thermal stability and device stability. Our results indicate that the PBDB-T:PC71BM:DTCFOIC ternary system is a promising candidate for the mass R2R production of thick active layer and large area high-performance PSCs.
