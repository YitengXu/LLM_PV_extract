A new non-fullerene small molecule acceptor IDT2ST-4F bearing a bisalkylthiothiophene unit as the π-bridge was designed and synthesized, which exhibited a low optical bandgap of 1.43 eV. The optimized organic solar cells based on PBDB-T:IDT2ST-4F gave a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.43% with a relatively low energy loss of 0.58 eV.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of a p-type conjugated electron donor and an n-type electron acceptor have been recognized as a very promising platform in solar energy utilization because of their light weight, flexibility, low cost, and large-scale roll-to-roll production. Compared with the traditional fullerene derivative-based acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) possess distinguished advantages including strong absorption in the visible and near infrared regions of the solar spectrum, adjustable electronic energy levels, and good morphological stability, which endow them with great potential for highly efficient OSCs. During the past few years, fullerene-free OSCs have advanced rapidly with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 14%, surpassing fullerene-based OSCs. Among the various NFAs, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type electron acceptors based on fused aromatic cores with strong electron withdrawing groups have become dominant in highly efficient OSCs. Since Zhan's group reported IEIC with indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the core flanked by thiophene π-bridges and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) end-capping groups, considerable research has been devoted to the chemical modifications of the side chain substituents, central-fused cores, π-bridges and end-capping groups, and great progress has been made.

The π-bridges incorporated between the D and A units could essentially extend the effective conjugation length of the central core. Introducing electron-donating π-bridges could elevate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to decrease the bandgap to attain a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc). Besides, it is easier to form a single C–C bond via a coupling reaction relative to the synthesis of a fused-ring extension. Additionally, the side chains installed on the π-bridges have a great influence on the optical, electrochemical and packing properties of the acceptors. For example, Bo et al. reported IDTT2F bearing 1,1-dicyanomethylene-5,6-difluoro-3-indanon (F-IC) end-capping groups and no side chains on the thiophene bridge, which exhibited an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.46 eV. Zhu et al. attached an alkylthio substituent to the inner position of the thiophene bridge and synthesized ACS8, which displayed a relatively lower Eoptg of 1.30 eV. When moving the alkylthio substituent to the outer position of the thiophene bridge, Bo et al. developed IDTCN-S, which showed an Eoptg of 1.48 eV. Besides, they have demonstrated that the side chain at the outer position of the bridge could lock the conformation of the terminal group, which is beneficial for intermolecular interaction.
In this work, we introduced two alkylthio substituents to the thiophene bridge and synthesized a new IDT-based NFA IDT2ST-4F. Its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1a. This acceptor exhibits intense absorption in the region of 600–900 nm with a low Eoptg of 1.43 eV. Poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]-dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) was employed as the electron donor material to fabricate solar cells, which has complementary absorption and matched energy levels with the acceptor materials. The optimized OSCs based on PBDB-T:IDT2ST-4F showed a high PCE of 11.43% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.849 V, a Jsc of 19.44 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor (FF) of 69.3%, which is among the highest values reported in the literature.
The synthetic routes and details of the π bridge and IDT2ST-4F are presented in Scheme S1 and in the ESI. Compounds 2–4 were synthesized according to the reported procedures.Via Stille coupling, the bisalkylthiothiophene 4 was attached to the core 5 to produce the dialdehyde compound 6 in a 70% yield. Finally, the targeted NFA IDT2ST-4F was accessed in a yield of 83% through Knoevenagel condensation between the key dialdehyde and the end-capping group. The chemical structures of the intermediates and IDT2ST-4F were confirmed by NMR spectra and mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S12, ESI). This compound exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene and chlorobenzene. The thermal properties of IDT2ST-4F were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, and the plots are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI). The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of IDT2ST-4F is about 300 °C under an N2 atmosphere, which is adequate to be applied in organic photovoltaics devices. No obvious thermal transitions in the DSC curve are observed.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of IDT2ST-4F in chloroform solution and a neat film are shown in Fig. 1b. In solution, this acceptor exhibits broad absorption in the range of 600–820 nm with the maximum peak (λmax) located at 738 nm and a maximum extinction coefficient (εmax) of 1.25 × 105 M−1 cm−1. From solution to the film state, the absorption spectrum was greatly broadened with the maximum peak red-shifted by 44 nm. Besides, a strong shoulder peak could be observed, suggesting that strong intermolecular packing exists in the IDT2ST-4F film. The Eoptg estimated from the absorption edge of its thin film is 1.43 eV, which is larger than that of IDTCN-S with alkylthio substitution at the outer position of the thiophene bridge, and smaller than that of ACS8 with alkylthio substitution at the inner position of the thiophene bridge as mentioned above. The results demonstrated that the number and the position of the alkylthio substituents could effectively tune their optical properties. From Fig. 1b, the intense absorption of IDT2ST-4F in the wavelength range of 600–900 nm is complementary with the wide-bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T in the visible-near-infrared region, which should be favourable for photon harvesting, and thus achieving high Jsc.
The frontier energy levels of IDT2ST-4F were determined by thin film cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements using a saturated calomel electrode as the reference and Fc/Fc+ (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) as the standard, and the CV curve is presented in Fig. S14 (ESI). According to the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of IDT2ST-4F were calculated to be −5.36 and −3.71 eV, respectively. Fig. 1c displays the energy level diagram for PBDB-T and IDT2ST-4F, which indicates the suitability of using these materials as a donor and acceptor in OSCs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to evaluate the frontier molecular orbitals and the optimized molecular geometries, and the results are shown in Fig. S15 (ESI). From Fig. S15a (ESI), the electron densities of the HOMO level are mainly delocalized over the core, thiophene and the linking double bond, whereas the electron densities of the LUMO level are distributed along the entire backbone. The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of IDT2ST-4F are −5.32 and −3.43 eV, respectively. The optimized geometric structures reveal that the dihedral angles of bisalkylthiothiophene−IDT (θ1) and bisalkylthiothiophene−terminal group (θ2) are 6.2° and 9.3°, respectively, indicating that IDT2ST-4F adopts a nearly flat backbone (Fig. S15b, ESI). The steric hindrance induced by the thioalkyl group may confine the terminal groups to a uniform configuration, which could be conducive to the end-to-end stacking and charge transport.
A series of OSCs were fabricated with a conventional configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-T:IDT2ST-4F/PDINO/Al to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of IDT2ST-4F, where amino N-oxide perylene diimide (PDINO) is a cathode interlayer material (Fig. S16, ESI). The devices were optimized by thermal annealing (TA) at 110 °C for 5 min. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the as-cast and TA-treated devices are shown in Fig. 2a and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1, and the distribution of the PCEs of devices based on IDT2ST-4F is also shown in Fig. S17 (ESI). The as-cast devices showed a PCE of 9.29% with a Voc of 0.854 V, a Jsc of 17.32 mA cm−2 and an FF of 62.6%. After TA treatment, the PCE was dramatically improved to 11.43% due to the increased Jsc of 19.44 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.3%. The Voc displayed a negligible decrease. The PCE was higher than those of the reported control acceptors IDTT2F (8.85%) and IDTCN-S (10.60%) (Table S2, ESI). The photon energy loss (Eloss) is calculated to be 0.58 eV according to the formula Eloss = Eg − eVoc, which is relatively small. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 2b. The devices show a broad photo-response in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm. After TA treatment, the EQE spectrum was broadened, and the EQE values were enhanced across the whole spectrum with values of over 70% in the wavelength range of 500–640 nm, demonstrating an efficient photoelectron conversion process for the TA-treated device. This is consistent with the slightly broadened and enhanced absorption spectra for the TA-treated neat and blend films compared with those of the as-cast films (Fig. S18, ESI). The Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves for the as-cast and TA-treated devices are 16.57 and 18.64 mA cm−2, respectively. The data are within 5% mismatch compared with the values obtained from the J–V curves.

To further probe the physical processes in the devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) of the OSCs is plotted in double logarithmic coordinates as shown in Fig. 3a. Jph is defined as the difference between the current densities under illumination and in the dark. For Veff = Vo − Va, Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage. At a high Veff (≥1 V), Jph of the OSCs reached the saturated state (Jsat). The Jph/Jsat ratio can be employed to evaluate the overall exciton separation and charge collection efficiency. Under short-circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat ratios of the as-cast and TA-treated IDT2ST-4F-based devices are 96.2% and 97.4%, respectively. Under maximal power output conditions, the Jph/Jsat values of the as-cast and TA-treated IDT2ST-4F-based devices are 82.1% and 84.1%, respectively. These results suggest less bimolecular recombination and a more efficient charge collection process for the TA-treated devices, which contributed to the higher Jsc and FF. In addition, Jsc of the as-cast and TA-treated devices under different light intensities (Plight) was also measured to study the charge recombination behaviours (Fig. 3b). According to the equation of Jsc ∝ PSlight, the fitted slope of the TA-treated device is 0.999, which is larger than that of the as-cast device (0.984), indicative of suppressed bimolecular recombination after TA treatment. The relatively low FF for the TA-treated devices may arise from trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination or geminate recombination, which was evidenced by the slope of 1.30 kT/q for the linear fitting curve of Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity (Fig. S19, ESI).
The surface morphologies of the blend films were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the AFM height images reveal that the blend films possess relatively uniform and smooth surfaces without severe donor or acceptor segregation. The as-cast PBDB-T:IDT2ST-4F blend film showed a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) value of 3.53 nm. After TA treatment, Rq slightly decreased to 3.25 nm. The phase image of the annealed blend film exhibited a better fibrous feature and proper phase separation compared with the as-cast blend film, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport. Besides, from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in Fig. S20 (ESI), the as-cast IDT2ST-4F film displayed no obvious diffraction peaks. After TA treatment, diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.50–4.60° derived from the lamella packing of the molecules were found in the in-plane and out-of-plane patterns. A broad π–π stacking diffraction peak at 2θ = 24.2° was observed in the out-of-plane patterns. The results suggest that the crystallinity of IDT2ST-4F was enhanced after annealing, which is favourable for exciton diffusion and charge transport, and thus improved Jsc and FF.
The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the blend films were tested by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S21, ESI). For the as-cast devices, the hole/electron mobilities are 1.47 × 10−4 and 2.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After TA treatment, the devices showed hole and electron mobilities of 2.91 × 10−4 and 3.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After TA treatment, higher mobilities are good for efficient charge transport and thus excellent Jsc and FF.
In summary, a new NFA with a low bandgap by introducing bisalkylthiothiophene π-bridges between the IDT core and the IC-2F end-capping group has been developed. OSCs based on IDT2ST-4F achieved a high PCE of 11.43% with a Voc of 0.849 V, a Jsc of 19.44 mA cm−2 and a relatively high FF of 69.3%. The high performance was attributed to the high crystallinity of IDT2ST-4F, the complementary absorption between IDT2ST-4F and PBDB-T and the better developed blend morphologies. Notably, the device exhibited a relatively low energy loss of <0.6 eV. The PCE of the optimized IDT2ST-4F-based device is higher than those of the reported control devices based on the acceptors with thiophene or alkylthiothiophene π-bridges. These results have illustrated that the incorporation of bisalkylthio-substituted thiophene into A–D–A-type NFAs can enhance the device performance.
