Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their superior power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has recently exceeded 22%. However, some issues remain regarding their use in real-life environments, with the most pressing matter being their long-term stability under humid conditions. Hybrid perovskites are naturally vulnerable to water molecules, which can induce the decomposition of perovskite photoactive chemicals such as MAPbI3 and FAPbI3. Therefore, to achieve commercial-level long-term PSC stability, the adsorption and infiltration of water into the perovskite films must be minimized. Herein, it is demonstrated that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) introduced simultaneously during perovskite spin-coating is highly beneficial to passivate the perovskite grains and adjacent grain boundaries (GBs). This not only promotes the formation of lead oxide (PbO) bonds that prevent a water–perovskite reaction, but also contributes to reducing the Pb defect density related to trap-assisted recombination. The photovoltaic performance of the prepared PDMS-passivated PSC is notably enhanced compared to a reference PSC (without PDMS), and surprisingly, more than 90% of the initial PCE (∼15%) is sustained after laboratory storage for 5000 h under 70% relative humidity. These results will pave the way for developing commercial perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as next-generation photovoltaic cells have attracted significant attention with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) that has recently surpassed 22%. Hybrid perovskite materials consist of an ABX3 structure generally with (i) A: monovalent cations including methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), cesium (Cs+) and rubidium (Rb+), (ii) B: divalent cations such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, and (iii) X: halide anions such as I−, Br− and Cl−. These chemical combinations have notably contributed to high-performance hybrid perovskite optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, plasmonics, and solar cells. In particular, the greatly improved PCEs of PSCs based on different ABX3 combinations have been steadily reported, which is noteworthy considering the short years of perovskite research. The remarkably enhanced PCEs are fundamentally attributed to the strong light–matter interaction and efficient charge extraction based on superior material properties, including their suitable energy bandgap (∼1.55 eV), high extinction coefficient, small exciton binding energy, long exciton diffusion length, and long carrier lifetime.

However, several issues remain to be resolved for practical operation of PSCs in real-life environments. The most urgent issue is the long-term stability of PSCs under humid conditions. Hybrid perovskites are naturally vulnerable to moisture as the perovskite photoactive chemicals such as MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 can easily decompose to PbI2. More specifically, adsorbed H2O molecules are dissociated into hydroxyl ions (OH−) by a catalytic reaction with reduced Pb+ ions. Subsequently, the OH− ions deprotonate methylammonium cations (MA+, CH3NH3+) to form volatile CH3NH2 at room temperature, leading to a severely degraded long-term stability of PSCs.
In this sense, the numerous grain boundaries (GBs) unavoidably formed within a perovskite film represent a starting point to resolve the moisture issue because such GBs containing abundant defects and porosities are highly effective routes for the infiltrating water molecules. Accordingly, researchers have developed direct and indirect solutions to minimize the adsorption and infiltration of water molecules into GBs. A direct solution is to replace the water-vulnerable photoactive organics (MA+ or FA+) with inorganic ions such as Cs+ or Rb+. An indirect solution is to encapsulate the entire PSC or infiltration routes connected to the photoactive organics. All inorganic PSCs employing inorganic cations successfully demonstrated long-term stable photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, the relatively high synthesis temperature required for hybrid perovskites and the reduced PCEs after the encapsulation were significant drawbacks compared to the organic-containing PSCs.
Therefore, recently, indirect solutions have been actively studied because they can be applied to many kinds of hybrid perovskite materials. In this regard, chemical additives such as fullerene-derivative molecules (e.g., PCBM) and salts (e.g., KCl and NaCl) have been used to passivate perovskite films. However, their passivation effects could not be maintained for a sufficient duration due to high volatility and large diffusivity of the additives, demonstrating long-term stability for barely more than 2000 h. Meanwhile, polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyurethane (PU), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) have also been used to passivate perovskite GBs. The polymers are firmly cross-linked around the GBs, inhibiting the adsorption and infiltration of water molecules into the perovskite grains. However, these polymer additives were not effective at a relative humidity (RH) of approximately ≥50%, which is a significant drawback considering the standard stability (that is, a stable PCE at RH > 70% for more than 1000 h) of commercial photovoltaic cells. Furthermore, the relatively high hydrophobicity of such polymer additives interfered with their uniform dispersion onto the perovskite film, resulting in polymer aggregation that may degrade the electrical properties of PSCs.
To date, the passivation and encapsulation methods listed above have hardly demonstrated long-term stability of ≥2000 h at RH > 70%. In this work, we report a facile passivation method using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to achieve unprecedented long-term stability for the longest time ever reported. Perovskite grains and adjacent GBs were simultaneously passivated by simply dropping a volatile PDMS solution during the perovskite spin-coating step. The PDMS not only promotes lead oxide (PbO) bonding formation, which hinders the water–perovskite reaction, but also contributes to decreasing Pb defects related to trap-assisted recombination. The photovoltaic performance of the PDMS-passivated PSC is notably enhanced compared to that of a reference PSC (without PDMS), and surprisingly, ≥90% of the initial PCE (∼15%) is maintained after 5000 h of laboratory storage at RH 70% in an illuminated environment.


Fig. 1a and b show the surface morphology and roughness of the bare perovskite and PDMS (0.03 wt%)-passivated perovskite (FA0.15MA0.85PbI3) films, as measured via tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The bare perovskite film (Fig. 1a) was composed of non-uniform grains with grain sizes ranging from 41 to 244 nm (average size: 122 nm, standard deviation: 51 nm). In contrast, the PDMS-passivated perovskite (hereafter, PDMS-perovskite) film (Fig. 1b) exhibited uniform and more circular grains with size ranging from 62 to 180 nm (average size: 120 nm, standard deviation: 30 nm). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness remarkably decreased from 17.3 nm (bare perovskite) to 7.4 nm (PDMS-perovskite), as shown in the ESI, Fig. S1.

The surface adhesion force between the AFM tip and sample surface of both the bare perovskite and PDMS-perovskite films was measured to further compare the morphological differences (Fig. 1c and d). In principle, the adhesion force is obtained by measuring the retracing force required to return a bent cantilever (after contact) to its original flat state (before contact). The cantilever bends down to a greater extent (contact mode) on a deeper and rougher surface, yielding a higher adhesion force that appears as brighter sections on an adhesion force map. As expected, the bright fields were distributed locally around the GBs of the PDMS-perovskite film, whereas the distribution of bright fields was irregular on the bare perovskite film. This adhesion force analysis indicated that the PDMS remarkably influenced the crystal growth of the perovskite film.

Fig. 1e depicts a series of nucleation, grain growth, and film formation processes. In the case of bare perovskite, nuclei grow by electrostatic attraction of positive or negative charges alternately (e.g., Pb2+, MA+ or I−) to the nuclei surface along a preferential growth direction normal to the (110) planes. Thus, excess precursor ions are attracted to the (110) planes, inducing fast growth with mostly faceted grains with rough surfaces. On the contrary, the added PDMS screens out the electrostatic attraction induced by the charged planes near the GBs, resulting in relatively slow growth. Accordingly, preferential grain growth is subdued and, instead, isotropic grain growth occurs, forming rounded grains with smooth surfaces (Fig. 1e). The perovskite grains became rounder and more uniform with increasing PDMS concentration, as shown in Fig. S2. The XRD peak at 14.01°, corresponding to the charged (110) planes, tended to decrease with increasing PDMS concentration, as shown in Fig. S3, indicating that the PDMS inhibited the grain growth along the (110) plane of perovskite. These results supported our hypothesis regarding the isotropic grain growth by the PDMS additives.
The conductive AFM (c-AFM) technique was performed to measure the surface current along profile line-1 and line-2 (Fig. 1f and g, respectively). The current increased at the GBs of the bare perovskite, whereas it decreased at the GBs of the PDMS-perovskite, as shown in Fig. 1h. The average current of the bare perovskite (∼188.8 pA) was higher than that of the PDMS-perovskite (∼130.4 pA). This is because ultrathin PDMS covered the perovskite surfaces, and filled the GBs. The reduced current of the PDMS-perovskite indicates that electrical leakage paths, especially through the GB regions, can be markedly decreased by PDMS passivation. According to previous reports, the thin insulating layers, which covered the perovskite surfaces and GBs, could successfully suppress charge recombination via such leakage paths and thus enhance carrier transport.
To confirm the differences in crystallinity, molecular bonding, chemical composition, and trap states of both the bare perovskite and PDMS-perovskite (0.03 wt%), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence (PL) were complementarily performed. Fig. 2a shows the XRD spectra of both the bare perovskite (black, top) and PDMS-perovskite (blue, bottom). Characteristic XRD peaks of both perovskites were observed at 14.01°, 28.44°, and 31.80°, corresponding to the typical FAxMA1−xPbIy crystal planes of (110), (220), and (310), respectively. No extraordinary variation that could be associated with a new crystal phase was observed in the spectra. The chemical inertness of PDMS was verified by the FTIR results, as shown in Fig. 2b. The characteristic peaks of the bare perovskite were observed clearly in the spectrum of the PDMS-perovskite. In addition, three new peaks were observed at 1260, 1083 and 800 cm−1 in good agreement with the peak positions of representative functional groups (Si–CH3, Si–O–Si, and Si–(CH3)2) of pure PDMS.

Fig. 2c shows the Pb 4f spectra of both the bare perovskite and PDMS-perovskite. The doublet peaks of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 disassembled into four peaks (P1, P2, P3, and P4). P1 and P3 represent the Pb–I bonds at a binding energy of 138.84 and 143.68 eV, respectively. P2 (at 139.17 eV) and P4 (at 144.07 eV) correspond to PbO bonds associated with Pb2+ cations. The P1 and P2 peaks were shifted by +0.5 eV, signifying a higher oxidation state of Pb2+ due to chemisorbed oxygen atoms. The P2 and P4 peaks were also shifted by +1.1 eV, with new sub-bands of PbO2 bonds appearing at 137.37 and 142.29 eV, indicating a strong interaction between siloxane groups (Si–O–Si) and Pb2+ cations. Fig. 2d shows the steady-state PL spectra of both the bare and PDMS-perovskites, measured at an excitation wavelength of 535 nm. The relative PL intensity of the PDMS-perovskite increased by approximately two-fold compared to that of the bare perovskite (Fig. S4). The increased PL intensity could be attributed to a reduced chance of non-radiative recombination at the GB defects, which can be indirectly proved with the ratio of near-band-edge area (ANBE) to defect-related peak area (ADR). The ANBE/ADR increased from 7.9 to 23.3 after PDMS passivation.


Fig. 3a shows the photovoltaic performance of PSCs prepared with various PDMS concentrations and a comparison to reference PSCs. With increasing PDMS concentration, the electrically insulated PDMS piled up excessively at the GBs and surface, resulting in a reduction in the short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Therefore, the PDMS (0.03 wt%)-PSC exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 21.10 mA cm−2, FF of 0.73, and PCE of 16.16%, as shown in Table 1. In addition, the box charts of the photovoltaic values for 30 devices (Fig. 3b) showed good reproducibility with PCE values of 14.4–16.2% for the PDMS (0.03 wt%)-PSCs. The best average FF was 70% at 0.03 wt% PDMS, and the other average FFs of the 0.045 and 0.06 wt% PDMS-PSCs were 65 and 67%, respectively. The smaller average FF (63%) of the reference PSC (w/o PDMS) is straightforward evidence for the hindered charge transport as well as the high recombination probability at the perovskite domains and GBs. Fig. 3c shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimal PDMS-PSC (0.03 wt%) and reference PSC. Throughout the range of wavelengths under AM 1.5G photon flux, the IPCE of the PDMS-PSC was significantly improved, where the integrated photocurrent increased from 19.88 mA cm−2 to 21.07 mA cm−2.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to unveil underlying reasons for the enhanced photovoltaic parameters of the prepared PDMS-PSC. Fig. 4a shows the Nyquist plots measured at the open-circuit voltage of each PSC under dark conditions. The small semicircle on the left is related to the charge transport resistance, and the large semicircle on the right reflects the charge recombination resistance of the prepared PSCs. The charge transport resistance slightly increased from 29.2 Ω in the reference PSC to 31.4 Ω for the PDMS-PSC, while the charge recombination resistance remarkably increased from 200 Ω (reference PSC) to 345 Ω (PDMS-PSC). This indicates that the PDMS additive is very effective, especially to reduce the recombination probability around the GBs. Additional evidence of the reduced recombination was obtained from the plot of the open-circuit voltage as a function of light intensity as shown in Fig. 4b. In the presence of charge trapping states, the photo-generated electron–hole pairs (EHPs) are prone to recombine through interaction with the traps, resulting in a Voc reduction. According to the Shockley–Read–Hall equation (Fig. S5), the slope (S = kBT/q) in the plot of Voc against the logarithm of light intensity is a direct indicator of the trap density (e.g., higher S values indicate more traps). The reference PSC showed an S = 2.14 kBT/q, remarkably higher than the S = 1.46 kBT/q of the PDMS-PSC (Fig. 4b), demonstrating the reduced chance of trap-assisted recombination.

Long-term stability is critical for developing a commercial PSC. In general, PSCs are highly vulnerable in humid environments because water molecules in the air can readily infiltrate and degrade perovskite photoactive chemicals. Therefore, it is important to protect the perovskite photoactive chemicals from contact with infiltrating water molecules. PDMS with abundant methyl moieties is hydrophobic, effectively limiting water infiltration. Specifically, oxygen atoms in the siloxane groups can prevent deprotonation of MA+ ions by suppressing the catalytic reaction between surface Pb atoms and H2O molecules, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5a. The inhibited water infiltration induced by the hydrophobicity was determined by contact angle measurement, as shown in Fig. 5b. The contact angle noticeably increased to 70°, 78°, and 86° with the PDMS concentration of 0.03, 0.045, and 0.06 wt%, respectively, compared to 40° on the reference perovskite.

The major photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) were repeatedly evaluated up to 5600 h, while being stored under a RH of 70% and the illumination of yellow light. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the initial Voc, Jsc, FF and thus, PCE values of the PDMS-PSC were almost unchanged after 5000 h, which is the longest stability test reported to date. It was revealed that the stability of the PDMS-PSCs had a similar tendency at PDMS concentrations up to 0.06 wt% (Fig. S6). In contrast, both the Jsc and FF of the reference PSC were reduced after approximately 700 h and eventually showed a 40% decrease compared to the initial Jsc and FF after 2000 h, although 90% of the initial Voc was maintained. The severely degraded Jsc and FF of the reference PSC resulted in a steady decay of the PCE, and only 20% of the original PCE was retained after 2000 h. The device edges of the reference PSCs began to discolor and showed a complete color change from dark brown to yellow, 4000 h after fabrication. For the PDMS-PSCs, the surface color hardly changed under the same storage conditions and measurements (Fig. S7). In addition, we conducted a stability test under 1 Sun light soaking conditions. After 50 min of soaking, the PCE of the PDMS-PSC reached a steady and stable value (approximately 85% of the initial value). However, the PCE of the reference PSC started to dramatically decrease after 10 min of soaking and eventually dropped to 50% of the initial PCE after 1 h (inset of Fig. 5d).
The long-term stability results above successfully demonstrated that the PDMS passivation was effective for maintaining the initial photovoltaic parameters for a long time, since the PDMS hindered the infiltration of water molecules into the perovskite photoactive chemicals.

Ti diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA, 75 wt% in isopropanol), TiO2 paste (18-NR), methylammonium iodide (MAI, 98%), spiro-OMeTAD (99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous), dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous), chlorobenzene (CBZ) and 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) were used as purchased from Sigma Aldrich without additional purification. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Mw: 27000) was purchased from Dow Corning. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99%) and formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99%) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry.


An electron transport layer was formed on an FTO substrate by sequentially spin-coating 0.15 M TAA in 1-butanol (2000 rpm for 20 s) and TiO2 paste in 2-ME (1:5 w/w, 4000 rpm for 15 s), and then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. A 1.2 M FAxMA1−xPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2, MAI, FAI, and DMSO (at a molar ratio of 1:0.85:0.15:1) in DMF. A perovskite film was spin-coated with the precursor solution in three steps; (i) 500 rpm for 5 s, (ii) 2000 rpm for 10 s, and (iii) 5000 rpm for 20 s. A 0.3 mL sample of toluene without and with PDMS (0.03, 0.045, and 0.06 wt% of PDMS included in toluene) was dropped onto the substrate during spin-coating step (ii). Then, the as-made films were annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, a 0.06 M spiro-OMeTAD solution in CBZ (additives: 28.8 μL of TBP and 17.5 μL of 1.8 M Li-TFSI in acetonitrile) was spin-coated onto the film. Finally, a gold electrode (75 nm) was deposited using a shadow mask through thermal evaporation. All the processes above were performed in an N2 ambient glove box.


The topography, adhesion force, and local current mapping of the perovskite film were performed using an AFM system (MultiMode 8-HR AFM, Brucker). The crystallographic data were acquired by XRD adopting Cu Kα X-ray radiation (40 kV, 100 mA, Rigaku D/max-2400). The IR spectra were measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR, Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer). The material compositions and electronic states were analyzed by X-ray spectroscopy (XPS, MULTITAB 2000) with a monochromic X-ray source (Al Kα). The optical properties were analyzed via photoluminescence (PL) measurement (Andor Shamrock SR-500i-A spectrometer, Andor Tech) using a 532 nm laser (SDL-532 = 200T, Shanghai Dream Lasers Technology Co., Ltd.).


The photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) curves of the PSCs were measured at an active area of 4.64 mm2 under 100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5G illumination (SANEI solar simulator, Class A). Prior to the illumination, the light intensity was calibrated using a reference silicon photodiode (Ashahi Spectra Co., Ltd.). Electrical properties were evaluated using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The Nyquist plot data were acquired by EIS analysis (FRA2 μAUTOLAB typeIII) over a frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz at the open-circuit voltage of each cell under dark conditions. The acquisition of the IPCE and integrated current density of the PSCs was conducted using an IPCE measurement system (QE-IPCE 3000). The long-term stability test was performed while being stored under a RH of 70% and the illumination of yellow light (∼13 mW cm−2). For the light soaking test, the PSCs were continuously illuminated to 1 Sun spectral light (∼100 mW cm−2).


We successfully demonstrated that PDMS-PSCs possess superior long-term stability for up to 5000 h after PSC fabrication. The PDMS effect, which hinders the infiltration of water molecules into the perovskite, was faithfully evidenced by morphological, spectroscopic, electrical, and electrochemical analysis results. The underlying mechanism of the isotropic grain growth, and thus the formation of rounded grains with smooth surfaces was explained via the charge screening effect of PDMS mainly distributed at the GBs. Owing to the reduced trap-assisted recombination and the enhanced device stability, the best PDMS-PSC exhibited a PCE of 16.16%, FF of 70% and Jsc of 21.10 mA cm−2. This practical and facile PDMS passivation method will contribute to enhancing the long-term stability of other organic–inorganic hybrid materials, and thus, to the development of commercial-level photovoltaic module devices.
