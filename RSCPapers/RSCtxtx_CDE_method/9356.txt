Deploying earth abundant copper as a redox mediator in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has been found to be a very promising strategy to achieve higher photovoltage and power conversion efficiencies in full sun (100 mW cm−2) and in low/diffuse light conditions. Achieving higher photovoltage without compromising photocurrent helped copper electrolyte attract considerable attention among alternate electrolytes currently employed in DSCs. The very small reorganization energy between Cu(I) and Cu(II) and small molecular size helped copper achieve unit regeneration efficiency, with a driving force as low as 100 mV and a high diffusion coefficient (Dn), leading to better diffusion length (Ln) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc). Mass transport issues were also found to be improved for copper electrolytes in comparison with cobalt electrolytes. As it is inert to silver and other electrical contacts used in DSCs and possesses higher mobility even in solid state, copper-based electrolyte is a promising candidate to spearhead the commercialization of dye solar technology. In this regard, a detailed evaluation of internal electron transfer dynamics is highly essential to understand the limiting processes in these devices. In the present study, we performed a comparison between copper, cobalt and iodine electrolytes using the same dye (LEG4), semiconductor (TiO2) and additive concentrations to understand in detail the charge transfer processes leading to higher photoconversion efficiencies and also probe the various deleterious processes taking place in copper devices that provide opportunities to further improve its performance in future.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have allured the photovoltaic community since their invention by Brian O'Regan and Michael Grätzel due to their cost effectiveness, ease of fabrication, and aesthetics. Power conversion efficiencies above 14% have already been achieved under full sun AM 1.5G irradiation using DSCs. Recently, Michael Grätzel and Anders Hagfeldt successfully showcased this solar technology as superior in comparison with all the existing first and second generation technologies for indoor light harvesting applications, delivering an efficiency of 32% (1000 lux, CFL), thus causing a resurgence in efforts of commercializing dye-sensitized solar cells. Semiconductor, dye and electrolyte are the three major components of DSCs. The dye absorbs light and the excited electrons are injected into the semiconductor. Then, the oxidized dye is regenerated by the redox electrolyte. To cater to the needs of industry for commercialization of DSCs, there is a great demand to develop electrolytes that are efficient and non-corrosive towards current collectors used in modules/panels and capable of delivering more voltage, which is a pre-requisite for the smooth functioning of low power energy harvesting circuits used in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte has been the most successful redox electrolyte in DSCs till date. The success of I−/I3− redox couple is mainly attributed to its slow recombination, fast regeneration and high solubility. Unfortunately, the mechanism involving I−/I3− is still unclear, which obscures the understanding of the fundamental processes. Another major drawback of I−/I3− is the requirement of large driving force for regeneration, which prevents attainment of higher photovoltage.

To circumvent the issues related to the conventional I−/I3− electrolyte, metal complex based redox mediators were introduced as a viable option. Among these, cobalt-based redox couples occupy a prominent position. Cobalt electrolyte offers flexibility to precisely tune the redox potential to match the dye energetics by varying the ligands surrounding the metal center and also by introducing electron donating or withdrawing substituents to the ligands. It was successfully proved to be the best electrolyte in combination with organic dyes to achieve higher voltage and efficiency. Although cobalt electrolyte is employed in all the highly efficient DSCs reported in literature, it is prone to high recombination coupled with mass transport issues as a result of bulky polypyridyl ligands, which are not yet completely solved.
Recently, the realization of the potential of using earth abundant copper metal complexes as electrolytes has rejuvenated DSC research. Being a metal complex, it allows fine tuning of the redox potential by judicious substitution of peripheral ligands. In addition, the low cost and low toxicity of these earth abundant materials pave the way for commercialization of DSCs. Copper redox electrolyte [Cu(I)/(II)] was first used by Fukuzumi et al., giving an efficiency of 1.4% using bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) Cu(I)/(II) [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ and N719 dye in 1 sun as well as improved performance of 2.2% in low-light intensities (∼20 mW cm−2). A few years later, in 2011, Wang et al. reported an improved efficiency of 7% at 100 mW cm−2 and 8.3% at 23 mW cm−2 in AM 1.5G light employing [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ with C218 organic dye. This was followed by the breakthrough contribution from Freitag et al. where efficiency of above 10% was reported using new copper based redox shuttle at 100 mW cm−2 in AM 1.5G light. Modified copper electrolytes employing substituted ligands [Cu(I) (II)/bpye and Cu(I) (II)/dmbp] were successfully employed with LEG4 and Y123 dyes, surpassing the record 10% efficiency. By employing a “cocktail” organic dye mixture of D35 and XY1 along with Cu(I) (II)/(tmby) as the redox shuttle, Hagfeldt and Grätzel achieved a very high open circuit photovoltage of 1.1 V, resulting in efficiency of 11.3% in AM 1.5G light and 28.9% under 1000 lux (indoor CFL illumination), corresponding to a power output of 88.5 μW cm−2. Earlier this year, the same group came up with a new modified architecture for copper based electrolyte completely devoid of spacer, leading to a record PCE of 13.1% under standard AM 1.5G simulated light and 32% in artificial indoor light (Osram 1000 lux 930 warm white fluorescent tube light), giving power output of 283 μW cm−2 using an active area of 2.80 cm2. The amount of power generated even in such a small area is sufficient to make electronic devices completely autonomous, thus opening up a wide area of applications in self powered e-readers, tablets and IoT-related applications.
Copper redox mediators are perceived to be responsible for this paradigm shift in DSC research. In the past few years, unprecedented progress in the area of dye cells has been achieved by employing copper electrolytes in full sunlight and indoor/lowlight/diffused light conditions. To further improve the performance of DSCs employing copper-based electrolytes and to sale up such DSCs to commercial manufacturing scale, a more extensive understanding of internal charge transfer dynamics and evaluation of the limiting processes are required. In this regard, the present contribution involves a deeper perception into the influence of copper electrolyte on various charge transfer processes in DSCs in comparison with existing DSCs employing iodide/triiodide and cobalt electrolytes. For direct comparison, we employed the same dye (LEG4), similar electrode materials, identical device architecture and uniform electrolyte composition for all the three electrolytes to achieve uniform diffusion of the oxidized species in all the three systems. Schematic representation of energetics of various components employed in the present study is given in Scheme 1.

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. LEG4, and cobalt and copper electrolytes were obtained from Dyenamo AB (Stockholm, Sweden).


First, the working electrodes of 2 × 2 cm2 FTO (Tec15, GreatCell Solar) glass were cleaned by sonication with soap solution, accompanied by delicate rubbing in running water and followed by sonication in Millipore water and sonication in IPA and acetone for 15 minutes, sequentially, with each step succeeded by UV–O3 treatment. Then, the substrates were immersed in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution for 30 minutes at 70 °C and annealed at 500 °C for 30 minutes. The mesoporous TiO2 (30 nm particles, Dyenamo) layer was deposited by doctor blading using of a 0.3 cm2 gasket on mode using 3M scotch tape followed by 100 °C annealing for 10 minutes. A TiO2 scattering layer (250 nm particles) was coated over the transparent layer, followed by programmed heating at 325 °C for 15 min, 375 °C for 15 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 30 minutes. Thickness of the TiO2 (active layer + scattering layer) film was measured using profilometer and was found to be 12 ± 03 μm. The post-blocking layer was subsequently deposited by heating the electrodes in 40 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C, succeeded by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. Cooling of the sintered photoanodes to 70 °C was accompanied by immersion in LEG4 dye (Dyenamo) solution in 1:1 acetonitrile tert-butanol (0.2 mM) mixture; then, the photoanodes were kept undisturbed overnight at room temperature. The photoanodes were then rinsed in acetonitrile to remove excess dye. Counter electrodes were prepared by drilling FTO (TEC8, GreatCell Solar) glass substrates, which were then cleansed using soap solution, Millipore water, and ethanol, sequentially, for 45 min each, followed by UV–O3 treatment. Preparation of PEDOT electrode involved electropolymerisation of 3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT) from a micellar aqueous solution of 0.1 M sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 0.01 M EDOT. Solar cells were assembled with an electrochemically deposited poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) counter electrode (TEC8, GreatCell Solar) using a 30 μm-thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame. The predrilled holes were sealed using a coverslip immediately after introduction of electrolyte. The I−/I3− electrolyte was obtained from GreatCell Solar and contained 0.1 M lithium iodide and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine with 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate and iodine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile mixed solvent. The composition of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte was 0.22 M [Co(bpy)3(PF6)2], 0.05 M [Co(bpy)3(PF6)3], 0.1 M LiTFSI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte comprised 0.20 M [Cu(dmp)]TFSI, 0.04 M [Cu(dmp)2]TFSI Cl, 0.1 M LiTFSI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile.


Measurements of photocurrent voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were performed using a solar simulator Oriel (Model PVIV-94043A) Class-AAA solar simulator, accompanied by a Keithley E 2400 source meter providing light at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with AM 1.5 G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell. Circular black masks of area 0.18 cm2 (smaller than the active area) were used during J–V measurements to minimize the contribution of light falling outside the active area. Measurements of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of devices were performed under DC mode using a 250 W xenon lamp integrated with a Newport monochromator and a potentiostat, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell. Current transient measurements were performed under AM 1.5G illumination. The lamp was switched on and off manually, and the photocurrent response was recorded using Autolab PGSTAT 302N in potentiostatic mode by applying 0 V across the device.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an Autolab (PGSTAT 302N) workstation equipped with FRA under forward bias in dark. Measurements were conducted in a frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz with perturbation of 10 mV. Forward bias ranges for I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ systems were selected, where almost the same dark current was flowing in all the systems (Fig. S2, ESI). NOVA1.11 interface software was used for performing measurements as well as fitting the impedance plots. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT 302N) equipped with an FRA and LED driver to drive an array of red LEDs (627 nm, Thorlab). The intensity of the LED was varied by providing different currents. LED intensity was measured using a certified photo-detector supplied by ThorLab. Cell responses were analyzed in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Amplitude of sinusoidal modulation for IMVS and IMPS measurements was 10% of the steady light.

Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under 100 mW cm−2 and AM 1.5G illumination for LEG4 sensitized solar cells using I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ redox electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 1; the results are summarized in Table 1. I−/I3− system showed a power conversion efficiency of 5.79% with an open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of 783 ± 26 mV, 12.28 ± 0.71 mA cm−2, and 0.60 ± 0.01, respectively. Under similar conditions, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ delivered a Voc of 868 ± 12 mV, Jsc of 7.42 ± 0.18 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.7 ± 0.02, resulting in power conversion efficiency of 4.52%. Improved power conversion efficiency of 6.82 ± 0.32% was recorded employing [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte, resulting in Voc of 902 ± 10 mV, Jsc of 12.66 ± 0.55 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.6 ± 0.01. An improvement in Voc of 85 mV in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ system and 119 mV for [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ was realized with respect to I−/I3− electrolyte. The more positive redox potentials of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (E0 = 0.56 V vs. NHE) and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ (E0 = 0.94 V vs. NHE) compared with that of I3−/I− (0.4 V vs. NHE) resulted in achieving higher Voc on employing [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+- and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+-based electrolytes. The Nernst potential of the electrolytes was expected to increase by around 540 mV on changing the electrolyte from I−/I3− to [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+, whereas the actual improvement was only 119 mV. Similarly, there should be an improvement of 380 mV on changing the electrolyte from [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ to [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+. However, only 34 mV increase in Voc was achieved. This clearly indicates that it is not merely the redox potential of the electrolyte that determines voltage; there are other parameters, such as position of conduction band (CB) and recombination of electrons, which also contribute towards determining the voltage, current and photovoltaic performance. These will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

While examining the variation in Jsc, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ showed 4.86 mA cm−2 lower Jsc than I−/I3−, whereas [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ exhibited almost the same Jsc as that of I−/I3−. The drop in Jsc for [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ is due to the mass transport limitation of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle, which is elaborated in the following sections. Even with minimal driving force of 100 mV for regeneration, the reaction kinetics are fast enough to render close to 100% regeneration on employing LEG4 and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+, resulting in better current density. [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ outperformed both I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ with respect to Jsc, Voc and overall efficiency. Better FF for [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ could be due to low resistive losses from lower current density. Higher power conversion efficiency using [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte is attributed to its positive redox potential, which improved Voc and faster regeneration, resulting in higher Jsc. IPCE spectra of LEG4 devices employing all three electrolytes are shown in Fig. 1(b). IPCE was found to increase in the order [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ < I−/I3− < [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+, which is in accordance with the J–V results. IPCE is given by the equation
IPCE = LHE × ηinj × ηreg × ηcoll
where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency,
ηinj is the injection efficiency, ηreg corresponds to regeneration efficiency and ηcoll denotes charge collection efficiency. Using the same dye and similar photoanode materials and architecture, LHE and ηinj can be assumed to be unity. Therefore, the difference in IPCE is directly correlated to regeneration and charge collection efficiencies. Copper electrolyte, being the best among the series considering ηreg and ηcoll, exhibited a relatively higher IPCE. Copper electrolyte also proved to be the best among the three for power conversion efficiency in low light. Details are given in Table S1 and Fig. S1, ESI. Since IPCE is measured at low monochromatic light intensities, variation in IPCE between cobalt and copper complexes has a major contribution from regeneration and charge collection, in addition to the mass transport limitation.


Slower mass transport is one of the most challenging issues in alternative redox electrolyte based DSCs. Sluggish mass transport limits regeneration rate, resulting in reduced Jsc. Redox mediators diffuse either in the pores or in the bulk. Diffusion in pores is more mass transport-limited than in bulk. Very often in DSCs, Jsc shows a non-linear relationship with the increase in light irradiance. The variation in Jsc values with light irradiance is shown in Fig. 2. Current density is related to input light irradiance intensity by the relation Jsc ∝ Iα, where α is a constant. I−/I3− system showed an almost linear relationship with Jsc, yielding an α value of 0.93. The [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ system was found to be comparatively more linear than [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte, with α values of 0.85 and 0.53, respectively. The slow response of DSC due to long trapping and de-trapping times of electrons in TiO2 or mass transport limitation of redox mediator in electrolyte are the probable rationales for the non-linear relationship of Jsc with irradiance intensity. Time lag due to trapping and de-trapping can be ruled out, as TiO2 used for I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ systems is identical. Therefore, the non-linear increase in Jsc with light irradiance intensity is due to mass transport limitations associated with the electrolyte. It should be noted that [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte showed better Jsc than I−/I3− until 0.3 sun, but was severely affected by mass transport limitation at illumination intensities >0.3 sun in the present semiconductor configuration. To confirm this, we performed photovoltaic measurements with just one layer of 30 nm TiO2 particles, which resulted in an efficiency of 6% for [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, clearly giving evidence to the mass transport problem with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ in the present architecture. In order to have similar CB position on employing all the three electrolytes for a better comparison of charge transfer phenomena, we employed the same device architecture for all the three electrolytes. Generally, mass transport is delayed by steric bulk of the redox mediator. A six co-ordinate cobalt complex electrolyte with three polypyridyl ligands surrounding the metal centre is bulkier than a four co-ordinate copper complex with only two ligands. In addition, due to its smaller size, copper complexes diffuse through the electrolyte much faster than the counterpart cobalt system.

Furthermore, mass transport was investigated by photocurrent transient measurements. Fig. 3 shows the photocurrent transient measurements for I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ systems. In photocurrent transient measurement, current response of the device is measured by illumination followed by switching off the light. Photocurrent transient measurements were performed under AM 1.5G simulated light from 0.1 sun to 1 sun. With the increase in light illumination, Jsc reaches a peak value (Jmax); then, it either remains plateaued or decays to saturation current (Jsat). As the light is irradiated, electrons from the HOMO of the dye are excited towards the LUMO, leaving behind holes in HOMO. The excited electrons are then injected into the CB of TiO2. For further excitation of electrons, holes in the HOMO need to be regenerated by the reduced species present in the electrolyte. If the regeneration rate is equivalent to the excitation rate, the current density remains constant with time (Jmax = Jsat). If the regeneration rate is slower than the excitation rate, current density decays with time and reaches a saturation value (Jmax > Jsat).
For the device employing I−/I3− electrolyte, peak current was not observed, which confirms that the current is not limited by mass transport. The larger peak in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ compared with that in [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ illustrates higher mass transport limitation in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ than in [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+. At lower intensities, mass transport limitation was scarcely observed, as comparatively fewer electrons were required to be regenerated by the reduced species present in the electrolyte. Slower mass transport limits regeneration efficiency. For a better comparison at various light intensities, the overlapped data was plotted, as shown in Fig. S10, ESI. Furthermore, to investigate the consequences of mass transport limitation, regeneration efficiency is a useful tool. Fig. 3(d) shows the regeneration efficiency at various light intensities. With the assumption of sufficient driving force for regeneration for I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes, regeneration efficiency can be calculated from transient current by the equation (Jsat/Jmax) × 100, where Jsat is saturated Jsc and Jmax is the peak Jsc. For I−/I3−-based devices, regeneration efficiency was found to be 100% regardless of light intensity. For [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes, regeneration efficiency decreased with an increase in light intensity as mass transport issues become more prominent at higher intensities. Regeneration efficiency was superior for the [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+-based device, with regeneration efficiency value of 72% under 1 sun condition, compared with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+-based device, where regeneration efficiency was only 49%. This is interesting as copper electrolyte with only 100 mV driving force for regeneration reduces the ground state of the dye much faster than cobalt electrolyte with 480 mV driving force. High self-exchange rate for electron transfer and low reorganization energy helps copper attain higher regeneration yield even with low driving force. Furthermore, EIS was performed to study diffusion resistance (Rd) associated with I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ redox shuttles. A distinct semicircle at low frequency is observed due to the diffusion of ions in the electrolyte. Rd was calculated from the Nyquist plot fitted with equivalent transmission line model. Fig. 4 shows the plot of Rd against potential corrected for potential drop due to series resistance. Rd of I−/I3− electrolyte was so low that its resultant response in Nyquist plot was not observed. A distinct semicircle at low frequency in the Nyquist plot and Bode plot was clearly noticed for both [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ systems (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI). [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte showed lower Rd than [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte. Higher Rd results in slower diffusion of ions in the electrolyte. Recently, Freitag et al. successfully showed that [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ complex has a diffusion coefficient (Dn) of 25 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, which is double the value of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ complex (9.4 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), which was determined using cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, the smaller size of four co-ordinate copper complex helped achieve faster movement inside the nanoporous network in comparison with the six co-ordinate cobalt complex, achieving higher diffusion coefficient.

Light intensity dependence of Voc for I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes is given in Fig. 5. Voc is related to light intensity by the relation

(1)
where
I is input light intensity, m is the ideality factor, kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. m is calculated from irradiance vs. Voc plot using the standard linear equation.

Non-linear dependence of Voc with input irradiance was observed for I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes. Electron recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface results in non-ideality in DSCs. To block electron recombination at FTO/electrolyte interface, we deposited a compact TiO2 blocking layer, which significantly curbed the back electron transfer. Therefore, non-idealities due to back electron transfer at FTO/electrolyte interface can be ruled out to a certain extent. According to Bisquert et al., non-ideal characteristics arise due to recombination from exponentially distributed surface trap states located over the band gap of TiO2. There is always recombination from surface states, but the rate of recombination from surface states is slower compared with that from the conduction band states; therefore, recombination from surface states and conduction band states are hardly distinguishable experimentally. Recombination from trap states becomes more prominent when the driving force for recombination increases. Hamann et al. have reported significant recombination from surface trap states with reduced species of electrolyte employing [Ru(bpy)2(MeIm)2]2+/3+ redox shuttle based DSC. For I−/I3− system, m was found to be 1.19, which is very near to the ideal value where recombination rate is very low due to lower driving force for recombination from surface states. In [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte-based DSCs, m values were found to be 1.54 and 1.89, respectively, which shows the possibility of higher recombination from surface states in [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ compared with that in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. We strongly believe that with proper surface state passivation using techniques such as ALD where we can precisely control passivating layer thickness, recombination can be controlled/modulated, particularly by employing alternative copper redox mediators to further improve the performance of DSCs.

Furthermore, to investigate in detail the origin of variation in Voc with reference to the shift in CB, recombination, diffusion and transport properties, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in dark. EIS was performed with same device architecture and analyzed using the transmission line model developed by Bisquert et al.Fig. 6 shows the chemical capacitance (Cμ), recombination resistance (Rrec), lifetime (τn) and transport time (τd) for I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes as a function of corrected potential; the equivalent circuit comprising a transmission line model used to fit the data is provided in Fig. S5, ESI. Chemical capacitance (Cμ) is the quantification of the conduction band edge of TiO2. A negative shift in conduction band was observed in [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes with respect to I−/I3− system. The conduction band of [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte was found to be most negatively shifted in comparison with that of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte. Negative shift in CB results in higher Voc if the rate of recombination is unaltered. Again, a more negative shift in CB of TiO2 may lead to injection limitation in DSCs. Herein, injection limitation due to shift in CB can be ruled out as there is ample driving force (close to 600 mV) between the excited state of LEG4 dye and TiO2 conduction band. In addition, by employing [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte, whose CB is more negatively shifted than that of the reference I−/I3− electrolyte, showed similar Jsc, which confirmed that injection has minimal influence in determining the performance in the present case, and is complimented by the fast regeneration prevailing in copper based electrolytes. From the capacitance plot, it is clear that the higher voltage resulting for the copper-based electrolyte is attributed to the negative shift in CB as Voc is the difference between redox potential of the electrolyte and the Fermi level. A similar trend was also observed by Wang et al. in the case of [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ on employing C218 organic dye. Recombination resistance was found to be decreasing in the order [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ > [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ > I−/I3. Recombination resistance is given by the equations

(2)
(3)
(4)
where
β is recombination parameter, kB is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, q is charge and EC corresponds to the conduction band edge. By analyzing eqn (2)–(4), it is evident that a shift in the position of CB brings a change in j0, R0 and hence Rrec. Thus, the difference observed in recombination resistance can be correlated to the difference in position of CB of TiO2 using I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes. The time span for the average number of injected electrons in TiO2 before recombining with the oxidized species in the electrolyte is represented as the lifetime, whereas the average time required for the injected electrons to be collected at the working electrode is denoted as the transport time. Lifetime should be higher than the transport time for attaining efficient charge collection. [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ resulted in a slightly lower lifetime compared to [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3− electrolytes as a result of the negative shift in conduction band coupled with a more positive redox potential, thus leading to higher driving force for recombination from CB and sub band gap states to the oxidized species in electrolyte. In addition, a more porous 30 nm particle allows oxidized Cu2+ species to come closer to FTO, resulting in recombination from the FTO/electrolyte interface. Recombination rate is directly proportional to the driving force for recombination. Hagfeldt et al. had achieved Marcus normal region behavior for recombination using a range of cobalt redox shuttles with various organic dyes as well as a ruthenium sensitizer. Recently, Freiteg et al. also observed Marcus normal region behavior for recombination employing copper redox electrolytes with Y123 dye. In our recent contribution, we also observed Marcus normal region behavior for recombination using two triphenylamine dyes TPAA4 and TPAA5 with cobalt redox shuttles. As [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ has higher driving force for recombination, it is natural to have lower lifetime; interestingly, [Co(bpy)3] 2+/3+ and I−/I3− showed similar lifetime trends, which can be related to the nature of the semiconductor used in the present case. I−/I3− redox electrolyte is well known for its exceptionally slow recombination rate compared with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox electrolyte. However, employing a more porous 30 nm particle network leaves channels for small molecules such as iodine and copper to approach the back contact, resulting in more recombination, whereas for bulky cobalt species, access may be restricted to a certain extent. The above-mentioned behavior resulted in comparable lifetimes for I−/I3− and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolytes. Different blocking materials were tested at the TiO2/electrolyte interface to alleviate this recombination. However, in majority of the cases, the blocking layer not only prevented recombination, but also limited the injection of electrons to the CB of TiO2. The alternative and most promising approach to restrict recombination is to structurally modify the dyes, which prevents the reduced species from approaching TiO2, thus curbing recombination. To control recombination without compromising injection, we employed LEG4 sensitizer in the present study. LEG4 is a structurally modified dye with dicyclopentene spacer grafted with long alkyl chains which prevent the approach of reduced species to the TiO2 surface. In addition, enlarged steric bulk property of redox mediator also reduces the recombination. Hamann et al. observed that bulky [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte acted as an insulating spacer and reduced the electronic coupling due to steric hindrance, thus reducing recombination. Possibly, the suitable structure of LEG4 sensitizer could effectively prevent bulky [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox mediator from approaching TiO2, yielding the comparable lifetimes of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3− electrolytes. It is exciting to note that copper redox mediator gave the shortest transport time among the series of complexes.

Diffusion coefficient (Dn) and diffusion length (Ln) as a function of corrected potential are given in Fig. 7. Dn is inversely proportional to transport time, as given by the equation , where L is the thickness of the semiconductor. Dn decreased in the order [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ > [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ > I−/I3−. Slightly lower lifetime for [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ is compensated by higher Dn and hence, [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ exhibited longer diffusion length (Ln) compared with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3−. Ln is the distance that electrons can travel before recombination. Ln is given by the relation . Longer Ln results in better charge collection efficiency, which in turn results in higher IPCE value. This holds true in the present case, where copper electrolyte with better Ln resulted in better IPCE profile. Higher Dn and Ln obtained for copper might be a result of fast regeneration and slow recombination prevailing in copper compared to cobalt electrolyte.
To examine charge transfer dynamics in the presence of light, we performed photo-modulated perturbation measurements, such as intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). Results are shown in Fig. 8 and the obtained Nyquist and Bode plots are given in Fig. S6–S9 (ESI). For both photo-modulated measurements, monochromatic light (627 nm) was used as the light source for excitation. Electron lifetime (τn) was determined from IMVS by the relation

where
fm is the frequency corresponding to the highest value of the imaginary part (−H′′) in Bode plot. The lifetime was found to decreasing in the following order: I−/I3− > [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ > [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. The observed trend is found to be slightly different than EIS measurements performed in dark. This behavior is conclusive since under illumination, mass transport limitation was visible for both the outer sphere cobalt and copper redox mediators. Mhaisalkar et al. had previously observed the possibility of relatively slow moving bulky redox mediator ions accumulating at the TiO2 surface, thereby increasing recombination. As discussed previously, [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte showed much lower mass transport at higher light intensities, which is reflected in better lifetime for [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ in comparison with [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ in light measurement. Transport lifetime (τd) is determined from IMPS by the relation

where
fm is the frequency corresponding to the highest value of the imaginary part (−H′′) in Bode plot. τd was, in decreasing order, I−/I3− > [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ > [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+, which resembles the τd trend calculated from EIS measurements. From both dark and light measurements, it is clear that lower τd and higher Dn are the two major parameters which allowed copper electrolyte to achieve higher photovoltaic performance.


Redox electrolyte plays a crucial role in determining photovoltaic performance in DSCs. Electrolytes with positive redox potentials can serve as a viable solution to attain higher photovoltage. To study the gain and loss processes associated with changing electrolytes, we performed a detailed interfacial charge transfer dynamics investigation using various perturbation techniques employing I−/I3−, [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolytes. Though conventional I−/I3− based devices were free of mass transport issues, their Nernst potential was less positive in comparison with those of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte-based devices, leading to lower photovoltage. Although [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte is endowed with more positive redox potential in comparison with conventional I−/I3− electrolyte, slow regeneration and higher recombination coupled with mass transport limitations became an obstacle in realizing long term performance and stability in these devices.

Generally, an increase in voltage and decrease in current are indicated by more positive redox potentials as a result of slow regeneration rates and higher recombination, whereas for [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ based electrolytes, a different trend is observed. The simultaneous increase in both voltage and current for [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ based electrolyte is a result of higher regeneration rate and better charge collection efficiency in addition to superior diffusion coefficient and lower mass transport issues endowed by the smaller size of copper in comparison to [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolytes. [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ is placed at a potential of 540 mV more positive than I−/I3− and 380 mV more positive than [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+. In addition, [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte based devices result in a negative shift in conduction band, both conditions which should trigger more recombination for [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+-based devices in comparison with the other two electrolytes. With fast regeneration kinetics and efficiency, [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ was able to manage the recombination reaction to a greater extent. Based on our observations, for [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+-based electrolytes, the interception reaction takes place from the conduction band, sub-band gap states, surface states, and FTO to the oxidized Cu(II) species present in the electrolyte. Employing pre- and post-blocking layers can help prevent this recombination to a greater extent. This points to the need to employ pinhole-free compact blocking layers using techniques such as ALD, which would further improve the performance of the [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+-based devices. In addition, this indicates the requirement for structurally engineered dyes to help effectively prevent recombination. Mass transport is another issue that needs to be addressed for the [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte. The best option is reducing the spacer thickness, as recently shown by Boschloo and Oskam, which is effective in controlling mass transport in [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte based devices. In addition, further tuning of the porosity of the semiconductor is required to achieve the best performance from [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte-based solar cells. In summary, being environmentally friendly with easy synthesis protocols, low cost and earth abundance along with the ability to deliver higher performance in full sun and low light makes [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ based redox electrolyte a promising candidate for future DSC research.
