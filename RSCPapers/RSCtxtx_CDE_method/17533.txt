Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophere):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a common solution-processed electrode for printable organic solar cells. However, the water-dispersed PEDOT:PSS displays de-wetting issues when deposited on an active layer, which limits its application on printable top electrodes. In this work, we report a solvent exchange method to prepare alcohol-processed PEDOT:PSS. Spontaneous exchange of water and alcohol occurs when aqueous PEDOT:PSS in a dialysis membrane is immersed into alcohol. This is probably due to the polarity difference that induces different speeds to pass through the dialysis membrane. The residual PEDOT:PSS was further dispersed in ethanol and ethanol-based PEDOT:PSS (e-PEDOT:PSS) was obtained. The obtained e-PEDOT:PSS has good wetting ability and high electronic conductivity. The work function of e-PEDOT:PSS was tuned from 4.9 to 5.3 eV by adding an alcohol-based fluorinated formulation (PEDOT:F). The obtained formulation e-PEDOT:PSS was blade coated as the top electrode without additional hole-transporting layers (called 2-in-1 electrodes), and the fabricated devices based on e-PEDOT:PSS showed an efficiency of 14.02%.

The goal of organic solar cells (OSCs) commercial application is to achieve the fully printable structures. To further realize OSCs from laboratory research to industrial fabrication, printing is an ideal technology aiming at low-cost and large-scale production. However, the power conversion efficiency of fully printed organic photovoltaic cells (about 11–12%) still lags behind that of reference cells with evaporated metal top electrodes (about 19%) due to the absence of high-performance printable top electrodes (PTEs). Aqueous PEDOT:PSS is a potential candidate for PTEs but shows low efficiency. This is mainly due to existing issues of poor wetting and energy level mismatch between the nonfullerene active layer and the polymer electrode. To solve the issues, alcohol-processed PEDOT:PSS with high conductivity and work function is realized via solvent change. And the all solution-processed organic solar cells based on alcohol-processed PEDOT:PSS show a PCE of 14.02% for small-area devices with a reflector and 10.94% for large-area modules (23.8 cm2).


Organic solar cells (OSCs) are attractive in commercial applications due to solution-processed availability, flexibility and large-area manufacturing. The rapid development of non-fullerene acceptor materials has pushed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs over 19%. However, the performance of printable OSCs still lags. Printable top electrodes (PTEs) are key components for printable OSCs.

PTEs for printable OSCs with high performance require the following characteristics: (1) it should be solution processible, (2) high conductivity is required, (3) a high work function is required to collect holes, and (4) low surface tension is required to prevent the de-wetting issue. So far, the reported PTEs include silver nanowires (AgNWs), silver inks, and liquid metal alloy eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn). But these PTEs cannot simultaneously fulfill all requirements. For example, EGaIn shows a high conductivity (about 3000 S cm−1), but it is challenging to directly deposit EGaIn on active layers due to its low wettability.
Conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophere):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has merits of high conductivity and high transparency and only requires mild post-treatment. A highly conductive PEDOT:PSS formulation combined with silver grids has been used as PTEs in fully printed OSCs. Unlike lamination processing, the devices are generally coated layer by layer from the bottom electrode to the top electrode. Good wetting is important to obtain uniform film layers. PEDOT:PSS is water-dispersed which has high surface tension that causes de-wetting issues when deposited on hydrophobic organic active layers. Surfactants were introduced to improve the wetting properties of PEDOT:PSS, but those surfactants cause work function (WF) reduction and form electrical insulating regions, which will lead to the degradation of device performance. Aside from the issue of de-wetting, aqueous PEDOT:PSS is incompatible with high-performance non-fullerene systems due to physical and chemical interactions. Acid generated from PSS can react with the active layer, and water molecules from PEDOT:PSS can affect device stability. In comparison, alcohol-based formation is preferable for printable electrodes because alcohol can improve wettability and prevent acid dissociation. Recently, we have reported the alcohol-dispersed PEDOT formulation (PEDOT:F). It yields high-performance nonfullerne organic solar cells as the hole transporting layer (HTL) and shows great promise for fabricating fully printable OSCs. However, for PEDOT:F, the conductivity (10−3 to 10−2 S cm−1) is a limitation as an electrode.
In addition, the inherent WF of PEDOT:PSS is not high enough for hole transport and extraction from nonfullerence active layers. Additive HTLs, such as hydrogen molybdenum bronze and PEDOT:F, are generally introduced to solve the mismatched energy level between the active layers and the top electrode. It helps to improve the performance of the devices but enhances the complication of the fabrication processing. PTEs combine the functions of HTLs and top electrodes (2-in-1 PTEs) and show lower efficiency for printable OPVs compared to the bilayer of HTLs and PTEs (Table S1, ESI). 2-in-1 PTEs with high performance are highly desirable.
The PEDOT:PSS PH1000 has high conductivity, but it is water based. It would be an ideal formulation as a 2-in-1 PTE that combines the advantages of PEDOT:F (alcohol based) and PH1000 (high conductivity). Although PSS is only water soluble, a temporal alcohol-based PH1000 formulation for solution processing might be possible. Lee et al. reported an ultrafiltration method to exchange the water with solvent. However, this method is not effective for solvent exchange, where only 50% of water is exchanged for each exchange operation.
In this work, we report an efficient solvent exchange method to obtain alcohol-processed highly conductive PEDOT:PSS PH1000 by using a dialysis membrane. By making use of the polarity difference, water shows much higher speed to pass through the dialysis membrane than alcohols. When an aqueous PEDOT:PSS (denoted as a-PEDOT:PSS) formulation is filled into the dialysis membrane and then immersed in alcohol, water is spontaneously lost in the membrane. Then, alcohol is introduced to redisperse PH1000 and finalize the solvent exchange. The obtained ethanol-processed PEDOT:PSS (e-PEDOT:PSS) shows good wetting on an active layer, and a tuned work function by PEDOT:F enables good electrical contact with the active layer for hole collection. OSCs with these 2-in-1 e-PEDOT:PSS top electrodes showed a PCE of 14.02% for a small-area device with a reflector mirror and 10.94% for a semitransparent module with an active area over 20 cm2.


Fig. 1(a) shows the chemical structure of PEDOT:PSS and the procedures for solvent exchange to prepare the alcohol-processed PEDOT:PSS dispersion. The membrane bag containing aqueous PEDOT:PSS was immersed in ethanol. Then, the membrane shrank gradually because water flowed out into the alcohol from the membrane. The residual PEDOT:PSS in the membrane was taken out and redispersed into ethanol to its original volume before solvent exchange. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the content of ethanol in the e-PEDOT:PSS sharply increased from 14.2% (after 5-min exchange) to 91.7% (after 30-min exchange). When the exchange time was further extended to 50 min, the ratio of ethanol in e-PEDOT:PSS reached over 95%. Fig. 1(c) shows that e-PEDOT:PSS (exchange time: 30 min) presents a low contact angle of 39.5° on the active layer surface, while a-PEDOT:PSS presents a high contact angle of 91.9°. Contact angles for e-PEDOT:PSS with different exchange time are exhibited in Fig. S1 (ESI). The contact angle of e-PEDOT:PSS monotonically decreased from 65.6° to 33.3° as the exchange time increased from 5 to 70 min. To compare the effects of the solvent-exchange method and direct addition of alcohol into a-PEDOT:PSS, we measured the contact angle and solid content of diluted PEDOT:PSS. As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI), the contact angle decreased from 62.6° to 42.0° as the volume ratio of ethanol increased from 50% to 300%. Although a-PEDOT:PSS with 300% ethanol displayed similar wettability to e-PEDOT:PSS, the solid content correspondingly decreased to 0.28 wt% as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI). On the other hand, the solvent-exchange method resulted in a solid content of 1.02 wt% for e-PEDOT:PSS, which is comparable to that for a-PEDOT:PSS (1.10 wt%). Although diluting a-PEDOT:PSS with ethanol improves its wettability, the decreased solid content results in formation of very thin films with high resistance that deteriorates the hole collection. In addition to ethanol, other solvents are also selected to redisperse PEDOT:PSS in membranes. Fig. S3 (ESI) exhibits the graphics of PEDOT:PSS redispersed in ethanol, methanol, isopropanol (IPA), tert-butanol (TBA) and dimethysulfoxide (DMSO). The residual PEDOT:PSS in membranes can be dispersed in different alcohols and also aprotic solvents.

To understand the spontaneous water loss for a-PEDOT:PSS in the dialysis membrane when immersed in ethanol, Eosin Y is used as an indicator to monitor the procedure. The chemical structure of Eosin Y and its solubility in ethanol, methanol and water are shown in Fig. 2(a). Eosin Y is a triarylmethane dye and can be dissolved in alcohols, but it cannot be dissolved in water. Eosin Y exhibited strong orange color in alcohols, but remained colorless in water. As shown in Fig. 2(b), 10 mL of water (without PEDOT:PSS) in the dialysis membrane was immersed in 400 mL of Eosin Y solution in methanol or ethanol at a concentration of 1 mg mL−1. After 40 min of immersion, two observations can be made: (i) colors in the membrane changed from colorless to orange and light red, separately. This shows that alcohol can pass through the membrane. (ii) The volume of the residual liquid in the membrane became less compared to the initial water volume. Similar phenomena were observed when water in the membrane was immersed in Eosin Y solution with IPA and TBA solvents (Fig. S4, ESI). The volumes of the residual liquid are different when processed in different alcohols. This suggests that different alcohol molecules pass through the membrane with different speeds.
To quantify the different speeds of alcohols passing through the membrane, we measured the volumes of the residual liquid in the membrane after immersion in the Eosin Y solution (in methanol, ethanol, IPA and TBA) for different time (Fig. 2(c)). The volume of the residual liquid processed from TBA rapidly decreased from 10 to 0.2 mL after 75 min of immersion, while the residual volumes were 0.4, 2.0 and 6.8 mL when processed from IPA, ethanol, and methanol, respectively, for the same immersion time. The final volumes of residual liquid after 180 min of immersion were 1.8 mL for ethanol and 6.8 mL for methanol. Fig. 2(d)–(g) exhibits the absorbance spectra of residual liquid in the membrane processed from methanol, ethanol, IPA and TBA, respectively. The absorbance spectra for residual liquid processed from 4 different alcohol solvents became broader and stronger with an increase in the immersion time. For the absorbance of Eosin Y (Fig. S5, ESI), a narrower single absorption peak (540 nm) is observed at low concentration (less than 0.05 mg mL−1) and a broad band (from 350 to 550 nm) at higher concentration appears (more than 0.1 mg mL−1). The narrower single peak belongs to the monomers of Eosin Y. Two monomers of Eosin Y stack together forming dimers (known as H-aggregates) with an increasing concentration of Eosin Y, resulting in a broad band in the absorbance spectra. The absorbance intensity of the residual liquid with different immersion time is presented in Fig. 2(h). The absorbance intensity decreases in the order of methanol, ethanol, IPA, and TBA at the same immersion time. The residual solution volumes obtained from IPA and TBA are too small to measure absorbance when the immersion time exceeds 45 min. The spectra became broad more rapidly when processed from methanol than other alcohols. This confirms that the speed of passing through the membrane is in the following order: water > methanol > ethanol > IPA > TBA. With the speed difference, we could perform the solvent exchange for the PEDOT:PSS PH1000 formulation. Cellulose ester dialysis membrane contains large amounts of hydroxyl groups, and the solvent molecules passing through the membrane rely on the compatibility of hydroxyl groups between the cellulose ester and solvent. The relative polarity of water, methanol, ethanol, IPA and TBA is 1.000, 0.762, 0.654, 0.546 and 0.389, respectively. The hydroxyl-containing solvent with higher polarity shows higher speed to penetrate the cellulose ester dialysis membrane.
Electronic and optical properties of the e-PEDOT:PSS films were then characterized. Fig. 3(a) shows that the WF of e-PEDOT:PSS (4.9 eV) is similar to a-PEDOT:PSS (5.0 eV), which has an electrical contact issue with the nonfullerene organic active layer (such as PM6:Y6) that has a high ionization energy. To increase its work function, alcohol-dispersed PEDOT:F was added. The counterions of perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) in PEDOT:F contain C–F bonds that produce dipoles to increase the WF of PEDOT:F to about 5.6 eV. After adding 3 wt% PEDOT:F, the WF of e-PEDOT:PSS film increased to 5.3 eV. The higher WF of e-PEDOT:PSS with the PEDOT:F additive is beneficial to form good electrical contact between the active layer and the electrode. The alcohol-dispersed PEDOT:F additive did not change the wetting properties (Fig. S6, ESI).
Electrical conductivities of a-PEDOT:PSS, e-PEDOT:PSS, and e-PEDOT:PSS(3 wt% PEDOT:F) are 636.1 ± 46.0, 629.2 ± 34.2 and 529.6 ± 16.3 S cm−1, respectively (Fig. 3(b)). The a-PEDOT:PSS and e-PEDOT:PSS showed comparable conductivity suggesting that the processing solvent did not affect the conductivity. After adding 3 wt% PEDOT:F, the conductivity slightly decreased. Fig. 3(c) shows the transmittance spectra of PEDOT:PSS films with the sheet resistance of 100 Ω sq−1. The films of a-PEDOT:PSS and e-PEDOT:PSS showed comparable transmittance (about 85% at 550 nm). The transmittance of e-PEDOT:PSS with 3 wt% PEDOT:F (84.3%) is slightly lower than that of a-PEDOT:PSS and e-PEDOT:PSS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to show the contents of the e-PEDOT:PSS series (Fig. S7a–c, ESI). S (2p) signals are ascribed to thiophene from PEDOT and sulfonate from PSS and PFSA. The molar ratios of thiophene and sulfonate are 1:1.87 for a-PEDOT:PSS, 1:1.90 for e-PEDOT:PSS and 1:2.20 for e-PEDOT:PSS (3 wt% PEDOT:F). The composition of a-PEDOT:PSS and e-PEDOT:PSS is similar. The increasing content of sulfonate in e-PEDOT:PSS (3 wt% PEDOT:F) is derived from PFSA groups in PEDOT:F. In addition, F (1s) signals appear in e-PEDOT:PSS with 3 wt% PEDOT:F (Fig. S7d, ESI).
A combination of high conductivity and high WF enables the e-PEDOT:PSS to work as a HTL and a top electrode simultaneously. Inverted devices with the structure ITO/PEI-Zn/PM6:BTP-eC9:PC71BM/e-PEDOT:PSS are fabricated (Fig. 4(a)). The molecular structures of the active layers are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI). As presented in Fig. 4(b) and Table S2 (ESI), the average PCEs of semitransparent devices with e-PEDOT:PSS and e-PEDOT:PSS (3 wt% PEDOT:F) are 11.83% and 12.80%, respectively. The device with e-PEDOT:PSS (without the PEDOT:F additive) has a lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.77 ± 0.01 V than the devices with e-PEDOT:PSS (containing PEDOT:F additive), which is due to the mismatched energy level between the e-PEDOT:PSS electrode and the active layer. When the silver mirror is put on top of the semitransparent device as the light reflector, the short-circuit current density (JSC) of devices with e-PEDOT:PSS (3 wt% PEDOT:F) enhances from 21.19 ± 0.26 mA cm−2 to 23.31 ± 0.31 mA cm−2, causing PCE to increase from 12.80 ± 0.24% to 14.02 ± 0.35% (Fig. 4(c)). The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) and calculated integrated current density (Jcal) are shown in Fig. 4(d) and Table 1. The EQE spectrum of the device with a reflector has a higher value than the device without a reflector in the wavelength range from 400 to 900 nm. In addition, the J–V curves of devices incorporated with PEDOT:PSS processed from different alcohols (methanol, IPA, and TBA) are displayed in Fig. S9 (ESI). PM6:BTP-eC9:PC71BM serves as the active layer, and the devices are measured without a reflector. The efficiency of devices with PEDOT:PSS electrodes processed from methanol, IPA, and TBA are 12.74% (with VOC of 0.80 V, JSC of 20.95 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.76), 12.36% (with VOC of 0.80 V, JSC of 20.87 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.74), and 12.19% (with VOC of 0.80 V, JSC of 21.47 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.71), respectively. The similar performance of PEDOT:PSS with different alcohols highlights the compatibility of the solvent-exchange method with various solvents and broadens the potential applications of PEDOT:PSS in a range of situations. We further demonstrate the universality of e-PEDOT:PSS with other active layers. Table 1 and Fig. S10 (ESI) demonstrate the photovoltaic parameters, J–V curves and corresponding EQE spectra of devices based on PM6:Y6 and PM6:IT-4F. The devices based on PM6:Y6 show a PCE of 12.61 ± 0.29% (VOC = 0.81 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 21.93 ± 0.29 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.71 ± 0.01). The devices based on PM6:IT-4F show a PCE of 10.15 ± 0.16% (VOC = 0.82 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 17.05 ± 0.20 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.73 ± 0.01). Fig. S11 (ESI) presents the J–V characteristics and photovoltaic parameters of reference devices with evaporated MoO3/Ag and PEDOT:F/Ag electrodes. The efficiencies of the MoO3/Ag-based device for PM6:BTP-eC9:PC71BM, PM6:Y6, and PM6:IT-4F are 16.07%, 15.18%, and 12.38%, respectively. On the other hand, the efficiencies of PM6:BTP-eC9:PC71BM, PM6:Y6, and PM6:IT-4F devices with PEDOT:F/Ag electrodes are 16.05%, 15.45%, and 12.68%, respectively. The lower efficiencies of devices utilizing e-PEDOT:PSS with a reflector can be attributed to the optical loss caused by the absorbance of PEDOT:PSS. In addition, the J–V curves and EQE spectra of light from e-PEDOT:PSS incident directions are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI). The PCEs of devices with the illumination from the e-PEDOT:PSS side are 8.95% for PM6:BTP-eC9:PC71BM, 8.46% for PM6:Y6 and 5.65% for PM6:IT-4F. The absorption of e-PEDOT:PSS in the visible wavelength range leads to the decline of JSC.

Furthermore, large-area organic solar modules with e-PEDOT:PSS (with PEDOT:F additive) were fabricated. Fig. 5(a) exhibits the device structure of the module. P1 and P3 separate the bottom and top electrodes of each subcell, respectively. The generated charge from neighboring subcells entered and combined on the P2 line, resulting in the module in series. Here, the P2 line was filled with silver paste to enhance the ability of charge combination. Fig. 5(b) shows the picture of the semitransparent module with an active area of 23.8 cm2. The J–V characteristics of the e-PEDOT:PSS based modules with different active areas are shown in Fig. 5(c). The PCEs of the 8-subcell module with an active area of 23.8 cm2 is 10.94% (VOC = 6.41 V, JSC = 2.37 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.72). The active area of each subcell for the module is around 2.98 cm2 with a width of 0.56 cm and a length of 5.32 cm. The calculated geometric fill factor (GFF) is 83.1% where the width of the dead area is 0.13 cm between two adjacent subcells. It certifies the potential of e-PEDOT:PSS formulation in printing electronics.

In summary, we have presented a solvent exchange method to prepare a 2-in-1 alcohol-processed PEDOT:PSS formulation as the top electrode for organic solar cells. This method transforms water-based PEDOT:PSS into an alcohol-based solvent to realize good wetting on the active layer. The solvent exchange is based on the understanding that polarity difference enables different speeds of passing through the dialysis membrane.

After adding high work function PEDOT:F, the alcohol-based PEDOT:PSS simultaneously shows high conductivity and a high work function. It simultaneously worked as a transporting layer and as an electrode. The organic solar cells with the developed alcohol-based PEDOT:PSS electrode showed high performance. The formulation showed universality when working with different nonfullerene active layers. 23.8 cm2 organic solar module based on e-PEDOT:PSS with an efficiency of 10.94% is achieved. The presented solvent exchange method is effective for water–alcohol (or other organic solvent) exchange. It provides a way of solvent engineering to improve solution-processed electronics.

Polymer donors (PM6) and non-fullerene acceptors (Y6 and IT-4F) were purchased from Organtec Ltd. BTP-eC9 and fullerene acceptor PC71BM were purchased from Hyper, Inc. Zinc acetate dihydrate, 2-methoxyethanol and ethylene glycol (EG) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) was purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Cellulose ester Dialysis membranes (500 Da) was purchased form Yobios. Ethanol, methanol, IPA, TBA and Eosin Y were purchased from Sinopharm. Alcohol-dispersed PEDOT:F solution was synthesized as previously reported. ITO substrates were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd.


6 mL of water-dispersed PEDOT:PSS was added into the prepared dialysis membrane (500 Da) and immersed in 500 mL of ethanol. After various immersion times, the resulting product was taken out from the dialysis membrane and redispersed in an equal volume (6 mL) of ethanol. The mixture solution was sonicated with an ultrasonic cell grinder for 2 hours to make PEDOT:PSS well dispersed. Then alcohol-processed PEDOT:PSS was mixed with 5 wt% EG for higher conductivity. Alcohol-processed PEDOT:PSS with various work functions was obtained by adjusting the contents of PEDOT:F.


The inverted structure of the small-area device and large-area module was ITO/PEI-Zn/active layer/e-PEDOT:PSS. 200 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in 2 mL of 0.5 wt% PEI solution to prepare a PEI-Zn precursor solution. Then PEI-Zn was spin coated with 3500 rpm on the precleaned ITO substrates and then thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air. In a N2-filled glovebox, different active layers were deposited on the substrates. PM6:BTP-eC9:PC71BM (1:1:0.2, the total concentration of 17.6 mg mL−1) and PM6:IT-4F (1:1, the total concentration of 20 mg mL−1) were dissolved in chlorobenzene with 0.5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctaene (DIO) and then spin coated at 2500 rpm for 50 s. PM6:Y6 (1:1.2, the total concentration of 17.6 mg mL−1) in chloroform with 0.5 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was dynamically spin coated at 2000 rpm for 45 s. All spin-coated active layers were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, e-PEDOT:PSS was coated through the use of a doctor-blade coater with a coating gap of 150 μm and 15 mm s−1 blading speed on a 70 °C hot plate. The doctor-blading process was repeated several times until the sheet resistance of the electrode was around 100 Ω sq−1 for the small-area device and 50 Ω sq−1 for the large-area module. When fabricating the large-area module, ITO was patterned as 8 pieces of 5.7 mm wide strips by laser ablation (KW PIB 20w. Kewei Laser) as the substrate. After depositing PEI-Zn, active layers and e-PEDOT:PSS electrodes, a femtosecond laser (FetoYL-20, Wuhan Yangtze Soton Laser Co., Ltd) with 384 fs pulse was utilized to pattern the line (1 mm) for P2 and P3. Finally, a silver paste was deposited on part of the patterned lines using a brush pen for the connection between adjacent subcells.



J–V curves were measured using a source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments) under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) from the Newport solar simulator in a N2-filled glovebox. The transmittance spectra of the films on glass were tested using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (SolidSpec-2700. Shimadzu). Work functions and sheet resistances (Rsq) of various e-PEDOT:PSS films were measured using a Kelvin probe (KP-020, KP-Technology) and 4-point probes measurement system (RTS-8), separately. Combined with the film thickness tested using a surface profiler (Dektak X-T, Bruker), the electronic conductivity of e-PEDOT:PSS was calculated according to the formula: 1/σ = Rsq × d, where σ is the electronic conductivity and d is the film thickness. The Kino SL200B Contact Angle meter was utilized to determine the contact angles. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out using a spectrometer (AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W, Shimadzu) with an Al Kα source. The external quantum efficiency test was performed using a quantum efficiency measurement instrument QE-R (Enlitech Co., Ltd).
