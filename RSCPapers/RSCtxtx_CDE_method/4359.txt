We present the synthesis and characterization of seven new organic co-poly-ynes P1–P7 incorporating the phenothiazine (PTZ) motif and evaluate their optoelectronic properties and performance in polymer light-emitting diodes and polymer solar cells (PLEDs/PSCs). The co-poly-ynes were obtained in moderate to high yields via Sonogashira coupling reactions and characterized using analytical, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and complementary quantum-chemical modelling. The materials show strong optical absorption in the visible region of the spectrum and most also show strong emission with quantum yields in the range of 13–41% relative to rhodamine 6G (R6G). PLED devices based on the co-poly-ynes were prepared and the most promising was measured to have a brightness of up to 1.10 × 104 cd m−2. PSCs based on donor materials incorporating some of the polymers were prepared and demonstrated power conversion efficiencies of up to 0.24%.

Conjugated polymers are an important class of semiconducting materials that have found application in various types of optoelectronic (OE) devices. These materials show tunable structure-dependent properties, are low cost, flexible, lightweight, and highly transparent, and are amenable to solution processing and roll-to-roll production, all of which lend themselves well to miniaturized OE devices. Among the wide variety of polymeric systems available, π-conjugated poly-ynes, i.e. systems containing alternating and repeating −CC− units, have drawn considerable attention in the last few decades. Various homo-poly-ynes, hetero-copoly-ynes and metalla-polyynes incorporating carbocyclic or heterocyclic π-conjugated spacer groups have been reported in the literaure. It is now unambiguously recognized that the photo-physical properties and structural features, and therefore the potential applications of these materials, are largely governed by the organic spacers. For example, the introduction of electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) spacers into the main chain has been shown to be an excellent strategy for obtaining materials with extended absorption, optically-bright charge-transfer transitions, small frontier energy level differences (i.e. narrow band gaps Eg), and good electrical conductivity.

We previously found that dioctyloxyphenylene-2,3-diphenylthieno[3,4-b]pyrazine-based co-polyynes possess small band gaps (Eg = 1.72 eV) and can be used as donor materials for photo-voltaic applications. Cho and workers demonstrated that the presence of acetylene linkages in the D–A co-polymers not only facilitates favorable orbital overlap but also enables facile transport of excitons (electron–hole pairs). Cheng and coworkers subsequently demonstrated that the insertion of alkynyl units as side chains in a co-polyyne greatly improved their field-effect mobility behavior. Motivated by these primary observations, researchers around the globe have since reported numerous co-polyynes and demonstrated their applications in OE devices, molecular wires, transistors, and sensors, among others.
Among various reported heterocyclic spacers, phenothiazine (PTZ) has emerged as one of the most promising donor cores. The tricyclic chromophore adopts a butterfly-shaped core structure and is well known for its low cost and electroactive and photoactive nature. It has also been demonstrated that the presence of two heteroatoms make this core highly suitable for the construction of D–A materials with enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that the photostability and emission can be controlled by N substitution. We and others previously demonstrated that when PTZ is combined with a suitable acceptor fragment, the resulting materials are highly suitable for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic (BHJ-PV) devices.
However, while several studies have investigated PTZ-based dyads and triads, there are presently no reports of co-poly-ynes incorporating PTZ. Motivated by this, we report herein the design and synthesis of seven new PTZ-based organic co-poly-ynes (P1–P7). We engineer narrow bandgaps by judiciously incorporating fused and non-fused heterocyclic spacer units including thiophene, 2,2′-bithiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene alongside PTZ within the polymer backbone. We report a comprehensive characterization of the optoelectronic and electrochemical properties of the seven co-poly-ynes, including quantum-chemical modelling using density-functional theory, and assess their performance in polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) and polymer solar cell (PSC) devices.

The PTZ-based alkynyl ligand 10-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,7-diethynyl-10H-phenothiazine (1) was prepared in quantitative yield by reacting PTZ with 2-ethylhexyl bromide and tBuOK in THF according to previously reported procedures (Scheme 1). The alkylated PTZ (1) was then brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to obtain 3,7-dibromo-10-(2-ethylhexyl)-10H-phenothiazine (2) according to an adapted literature method. The protected ligand precursor 3,7-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)-N-(2-ethylhexyl)-10H-phenothiazine (3) was obtained by the Pd(II)/Cu(I)-catalyzed cross-coupling of the dibromo-PTZ species (2) and trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) in iPr2NH/THF. The resulting product was deprotected using aqueous KOH in MeOH/THF and purified using silica gel column chromatography, giving 10-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,7-diethynyl-10H-phenothiazine (4) as a light-yellow viscous liquid in 95% yield. Organic co-polyynes P1–P7 were synthesized by Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions between (4) and a range of dibromo aromatic spacers (Br–Ar–Br) using Pd(PPh3)4/CuI in iPr2NH and toluene. The organic co-poly-ynes P1–P7 were obtained in good to moderate yields (28–83%), which were subsequently purified by alumina column chromatography followed by precipitation in CH2Cl2/methanol.

The seven co-poly-ynes were characterized by IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The IR spectra confirmed the presence of the CC bonds from the characteristic peaks around 2079–2210 cm−1. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the compounds showed the expected peaks corresponding to the alkyl, aryl and alkynyl fragments. Polystyrene-equivalent molecular weights (Mn, Mw) and polydispersity indices (PDI = Mw/Mn) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a linear polystyrene standard calibration curve. GPC provides absolute molecular weights for all of the co-poly-ynes apart from P3 and P4, for which the comparatively low molecular weights and the sensitivity of the multi-angle laser light scattering detector meant we could only obtain apparent molecular weights. These measurements give weight-average molecular weights in the range of (4000–50000 g mol−1), corresponding to weight-average degrees of polymerization (Xw) between 13 and 213 (Table 1). The synthesized co-poly-ynes were found to have relatively narrow molecular weight distributions with PDIs between 1.12–1.78. These molecular weights should however be viewed with caution in view of the difficulties of using GPC to characterize rigid-rod polymers.

The absorption spectra of all seven polymers exhibit two absorption bands between 225–325 nm and 360–550 nm (Fig. 1). The former can be assigned to π → π* electronic transitions on the chromophores (Soret bands) while the latter can be attributed to intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor moieties (Q bands). The measurements clearly highlight the sensitivity of the ICT band to the organic spacers. When an alkynyl linker is connected to a strong electron-donating moiety such as PTZ it acts as an electron acceptor, giving rise to donor–acceptor (D–A) interactions, and these can be reinforced by connecting an electron-accepting moiety to the PTZ via the alkynyl linker. It has been shown that the D–A interactions are more prominent in organic polymers than in related metallopolymers.
The trends in the absorption profiles can be understood by considering the electron withdrawing nature and conjugation length of the acceptor spacers connected to the donor PTZ. It is well established that fluorinated aryl, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, and 2,3-diphenylthieno[3,4-b]pyrazine have a strong electron-withdrawing ability and their electron-accepting strength varies in the order of tetrafluoro phenylene < 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole < 2,3-diphenylthieno[3,4-b]pyrazine. We found the same trend in the present systems, with the optical band gap (Eg,opt) of the co-poly-ynes increasing in the order of P4 (1.92 eV) < P1 (2.15 eV) < P3 (2.57 eV). P2, P5 and P7 all have S-containing five-membered heterocyclic spacers but exhibit different Eg,opt due to differences in conjugation length. One of us has previously demonstrated that fused thiophenes are less conjugated while bithiophenes are more so due to different numbers of CC bonds. The same holds true for the PTZ polymers reported in this work, with the Eg,opt falling in the order P5 (2.51 eV) < P7 (2.60 eV) ∼ P2 (2.63 eV). Comparing both sets of co-poly-ynes, we conclude that the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacers induce the strongest D–A interactions when connected to PTZ, followed by the tetrafluorophenyl and S-based heterocycles.

Fig. 2 compares the room-temperature emission spectra of the organic co-poly-ynes. With the exception of P1 and P4, the co-poly-ynes show a single florescence band between 450–600 nm which we assigned to the S1 singlet excited state. Large Stokes shifts of 4278–5544 cm−1 (Table 2) can be attributed to structural changes occurring in this state, with the bent ground-state structure becoming more planar on the S1 potential-energy surface. The nature of the acceptor spacer group can be seen to have a substantial impact on the emission profile, with the emission maxima (λem) varying in the order P3 > P5 > P7 > P2 > P6. As for the absorption spectra, the emission spectrum of P6 was found to be the most blue-shifted, which could be attributed to the biphenyl moieties adopting a more twisted conformation. The quantum yields ϕF of the polymers determined relative to the rhodamine 6G dye (R6G; Table 2) highlight the crucial role of the extent of the conjugation, with P6 and P7 having the highest and lowest values of ϕF = 41 and 13% respectively.

To better understand the optical spectroscopy, we performed quantum-chemical calculations using hybrid density-functional theory (DFT) on the precursor PTZ moiety 4 and a set of model compounds M1–M7 approximating P1–P7. M1–M7 each comprise a chain of three PTZ and two spacer moieties, with the terminal alkyne groups capped by methyl substituents. Images and coordinates of the optimized structures of 4 and M1–M7 can be found in Fig. S1–S8 and Listings S1–S8 (ESI).

The calculated HOMO–LUMO bandgaps Eg are shown in Table 3, and isosurface plots of the frontier orbitals are shown in Fig. S9–S16 (ESI). Qualitatively, the bandgaps fall into a rough grouping of 4 > M2, M3, M5, M6, M7 > M1, M4, where 4 has the widest Eg of 6.25 eV, five of the model compounds have bandgaps in the range of 4.96–5.37 eV, and M1 and M4 have the narrowest Eg of 4.38 and 4.18 eV respectively. The bandgaps in the model compounds are thus reduced by 16–33% relative to the PTZ precursor 4. Inspection of the frontier orbitals shows that M1–M7 have heavily delocalized HOMOs that extend across all three PTZ moieties and both spacer groups. On the other hand, the LUMOs, while also very delocalized, do not extend completely across the two terminal PTZ units. Interestingly, the nodal pattern in the HOMO and LUMO of 4 are reflected in the corresponding frontier orbitals of the model compounds, which may be taken to suggest that the frontier orbitals of the model compounds consist, to first approximation, of combinations of the frontier orbitals on the subunits.

Taking the orbital energies of 4 as a reference point, we find that the HOMOs of the model compounds are raised in energy (i.e. destabilized) by 0.1–0.5 eV while the LUMOs are lowered in energy (i.e. stabilized) by 0.6–1.6 eV. While both will ultimately have an effect on narrowing the bandgap, these numbers suggest that the stabilization of the LUMO in the model compounds has the largest impact on the bandgap. Indeed, the LUMOs of M1 and M4 are calculated to be ∼0.5 eV lower in energy than any of the other model compounds relative to 4, which goes some way to accounting for the narrower bandgaps of these two systems.
The calculated bandgaps are 1.9–2.2 × larger than the measured optical bandgaps in Table 2 and are also larger than the electrochemical bandgaps presented in the following section (see Table 6). Furthermore, they are also considerably larger than the lowest-energy singlet (spin-allowed) optical excitations predicted from time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations (Table 4). This discrepancy may be ascribed to fundamental limitations of ground-state Kohn–Sham DFT, and/or to the truncated model compounds being an approximation to the extended electronic structure of the polymers. The Eg nevertheless correctly predict that P1 and P4 have the lowest Eg,opt while the other systems fall into a similar range, and the 1.2 eV range between M1–M7 is proportionally larger than the 0.71 range between the measured Eg,opt of P1–P7.

Simulated absorption spectra (Fig. 3) reproduce the main qualitative trends in the measured spectra in Fig. 1, and, in particular, correctly predict the longer-wavelength absorption maxima in P1 and P4 and the similar positions of the maxima in the spectra of the other five co-poly-ynes. The simulated spectrum of M7 (Fig. 3h) predicts a split long-wavelength band comprised of two almost equally intense transitions – while this splitting is not clearly visible in the measured spectrum of P7 in Fig. 1, the absorption maximum does have an asymmetric band shape, and the discrepancy may therefore be due simply to our choice of broadening. Quantitatively the absorption maxima are blue shifted by 10–40 nm relative to the measurements, which may be ascribed to solution effects and/or the extended conjugation in the co-poly-ynes compared to the model compounds. While the former could be tested and corrected by performing the calculations using an implicit-solvent model, we opted not to do this in the present calculations as we doubt that a single solvent environment would capture the range of environments in the solution measurements and test devices investigated in this work.

Table 4 lists the brightest 1–2 spin-allowed (singlet) transitions giving rise to the longest-wavelength absorption peaks in each of the simulated spectra. A breakdown of each of the transitions listed in Table 4 into component transitions between pairs of occupied and virtual states is given in Tables S1–S10 (ESI). This data clearly shows that the transitions in the model compounds are significantly red shifted compared to 4 and show a 5–30 × enhancement in the dipole oscillator strengths. The S1 state in 4 can be assigned as a “pure” HOMO → LUMO transition. With the exception of the S2 states in M4 and M7, the HOMO → LUMO transition is the largest component of the brightest transitions in the model compounds, but only accounts for ∼45–60% of the electron-density redistribution based on the sum of squared coefficients. In the S2 state of M4, the HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO account for 51 and 34% of the sum of squared coefficients, respectively. In the S2 state of M7, the dominant components are again the HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO transitions, which account for 38 and 32% of the sum of squared coefficients.
To further investigate the nature of the transitions, we used the method of natural transition orbitals (NTOs) to visualize the occupied particle and virtual hole states associated with each of the transitions listed in Table 4 (Fig. S17–S26, ESI). For the precursor PTZ moiety 4, the NTO analysis yields a single pair of NTOs corresponding to the HOMO and LUMO and the S1 state can be assigned as a π → π* transition. For the model compounds, the NTO analysis yields two pairs of NTOs with >10% contribution to the transition. In most cases, both NTOs closely resemble the delocalized HOMOs and LUMOs, albeit with reduced contributions from the terminal PTZ units. The NTO analyses therefore show that that the transitions involve a redistribution of the electron density across large parts of the molecules, but it is difficult to assign them definitively as ICT or π → π*. Two notable exceptions to this pattern are the S1 state in M5, for which the electron density in the largest contributing transition is concentrated around the central PTZ moiety, and the S2 state in M7, which consists of two component transitions between states partly localized on the two halves of the molecule.
Extrapolating from the model compounds to the polymers, one might anticipate that the extended structure would produce a large number of states that are closely spaced in energy (i.e. a “bandwidth”), which would in turn produce a high density of optically-bright transitions. This supports the hypothesis that, by tuning the bandgap through suitable selection of the spacer group, it should be possible to engineer co-poly-ynes with strong visible absorption, as we demonstrate in this work.
Finally, we note that the simulated spectra in Fig. 3 indicate the presence of spin–forbidden (triplet) states. The energies and wavelengths of the lowest-lying T1 states are collected in Table 5. The T1 states invariably have lower energies than the S1 states, and for some of the model compounds even extend into the infrared part of the spectrum. However, given their nature, it is not clear how accessible these states would be and therefore what role they would play in the optical properties. Discerning this would require further, somewhat involved, excited-state calculations that are beyond the scope of this study.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on the polymer-modified interfaces in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/CH3CN solution using 1.0 mM ferrocene as an internal reference to determine and compare the redox potentials of the co-poly-ynes. All seven co-poly-ynes exhibited quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction features (Fig. 4 and Table 6). The multiple pseudo-reversible oxidations observed for the co-poly-ynes are similar to other reports on oligomers, co-polymers and homopolymers of PTZ. P5 and P6 show two oxidation peaks at the anodic peak potentials Eoxpa = 0.63/0.42 and 0.52/0.39 V vs. Fc+/0, respectively, which were tentatively ascribed to the formation of radical cation and dication species. The first oxidation of the phenothiazine moiety leads to the formation of a radical cation species at the nitrogen center, which is converted to the dication species by further oxidation of the electron pair at the sulfur atom. Upon scanning in the negative region, all the co-poly-ynes exhibited electron acceptor dependent reduction waves (Fig. 4). The measured redox potentials were also used to determine the energy levels of the frontier orbitals (i.e. the HOMO and LUMO) according to:
ELUMO = [(Ered − E1/2(ferrocene)) + 4.8] eV
EHOMO = [(Eox − E1/2(ferrocene)) + 4.8] eV
In current studies, ferrocene was used as an internal standard (see Fig. S27, ESI
). Two peaks at 0.37 and 0.44 V vs. Ag/ACl were observed, hence the E1/2(ferrocene) is equal to approx. 0.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl and employed as a potential reference (see Fig. 4). The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels are presented in Table 6 and give electrochemical band gaps Eg,ele in the range of 1.80–2.09 eV. The electrochemical results are in good agreement with optical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. These are notably smaller than the measured optical band gaps, but this is expected as they refer to distinct processes – the optical bandgaps correspond to the energies required to effect a “vertical” excitation or to form a bound exciton, whereas the electrochemical (transport) band gaps are the energies required to form free carriers.

The redox behavior of the co-poly-ynes suggest that p- and n-type doping of these materials to form conducting states would be feasible, so the systems could be used as electrochemically amphoteric push–pull chromophores that can accept or release electrons at relatively low voltages. They could also be utilized for applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) or organic field-effect transistors as functional hole- and electron-transport layers. Additionally, the highly fluorescent co-poly-ynes P2–P3 and P5–P7 could also potentially serve as redox-switchable emitters in OLED devices. We explore some of these points further in the following subsection.

The strong photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of the polymers in solution suggests potential applications in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs).

We therefore took P7 as a base to optimize electroluminescent devices with single emissive layers, comprising stacks of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/TFB (20 nm)/P7:PVK (30 nm)/TPBi (20 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). (ITO – indium tin oxide; PEDOT:PSS – poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate); TFB – poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenylamine); PVK – poly(9-vinylcarbazole); TPBi – benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene.) Here, PEDOT:PSS and TFB serve as the hole-injection and hole-transporting materials, respectively, TPBi serves as both an electron-transporting and a hole-blocking material, and LiF serves to enhance the electron injection. The P7:PVK layer was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution with a controlled ratio and film thickness.
In order to obtain high-performance devices, different doping concentrations of P7 in the PVK host material were tested. The electroluminescence spectra and current density–voltage–luminance (J–V–L), current efficiency–luminance (CE–L), power efficiency–luminance (PE–L) and external quantum efficiency–luminance (EQE–L) characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. S29–S32 (ESI). These tests indicated that a 30 nm P7:PVK layer containing 10 wt% of the co-poly-yne exhibited the best performance, with a peak emission wavelength of 518 nm, a maximum current efficiency of 3.34 cd A−1, a maximum power efficiency of 3.16 lm W−1, and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.21%. In this device geometry, a brightness of 1.1 × 104 cd m−2 was obtained, which is higher than that reported for other poly-yne based PLEDs. The results are also comparable to or higher than other reported PTZ-based OLED materials. We also noted a clear emission shoulder between 400–500 nm which decreased in intensity with increasing doping concentration, and which may therefore be emission from the PVK host material.
We next proceeded to fabricate devices based on P1–P6 using the optimal configuration identified for P7. Electroluminescent devices based on these polymers exhibited emission ranging from green to deep red and near-infrared (NIR) (Fig. 5). The J–V–L curves of the devices are compared in Fig. S33 (ESI). The maximum emission wavelengths and corresponding Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and the turn-on voltages, maximum luminance, current and power efficiencies, and external quantum efficiencies of the devices are compared in Table 7. Fig. 6 compares the CE–L, PE–L and EQE–L of the devices based on P1, P3, P5, and P7, and the corresponding measurements for devices based on P2, P4, and P6 are shown in Fig. S34 (ESI).

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) using the co-poly-ynes with relatively high absorption coefficients (P5/P7) and with more red-shifted absorption profiles (P1/P4) as electron donors and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron acceptor were fabricated and characterized (Table 8). ITO spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS was used as the hole-collecting electrode, while the electron-collecting electrode was formed from Al/Ca.

Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves of solar cells with 1:1 w/w donor and acceptor active layers under simulated AM1.5 solar irradiation. The power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices increases in the order P5 < P4 < P7 < P1. The best-performing cell is that with P1 as an electron donor, which has an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.46 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.94 mA cm2, and an electrical fill factor (FF) of 27.17%, resulting in an overall PCE of 0.24%. This device shows a markedly better Jsc and PCE compared to devices based on the other co-poly-ynes in the same blend ratio. Efficient conversion depends on both the absorption wavelength and the absorption coefficient, and the enhanced absorption coefficient of P1, obtained by increasing the co-poly-yne conjugation chain length with additional thienyl rings, suggests this represents an effective strategy for optimizing the co-poly-ynes to improve the PSC performance. The requirement for a high absorption coefficient is also seen in the relative performance of P5/P7 (ε = 13.8 × 104/10.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and P4/P1 (10.6 × 104/10.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1).
The best-performing P1 device was further optimized by varying the spin-coating rate from 600–1800 rpm (Fig. S35 and Table S11, ESI), producing film thicknesses from 54–115 nm. We found that a speed of 1200 rpm, which produces a film of ca. 84 nm, gave the optimal device characteristics.
The relatively small electrochemical band gaps of P1, P4, P5 and P7 translate to low Voc values of 0.46, 0.51, 0.43 and 0.17 V, respectively. Moreover, the LUMO level of the PCBM acceptor (−3.41 eV) is higher than the electrochemical LUMO levels of P4 (−3.46 eV), P5 (−3.44 eV) and P7 (−3.46 eV), but lower than that of P1 (−3.20 eV), which explains the low PCE of the devices based on P4, P5 and P7 (cf.Table 8). The design of polymers for photovoltaic applications should therefore consider the optical bandgap, the absorption coefficient, the absolute positions of the energy levels, and optimizing the thickness of the blend films.
The fill factors are not particularly high in our devices because all processing, save for the PEDOT:PSS annealing and electrode deposition, and all measurements were performed in ambient air, which likely results in the formation of trap states. We therefore expect that the fill factors could be improved by fabricating and characterizing the devices under an inert atmosphere. A more comprehensive study of charge transport and the influence of traps is therefore necessary to further improve the overall device performance. Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate that our approach of optimizing the spacer group in PTZ-based co-poly-ynes can potentially serve as a “bottom-up” strategy to designing high-performance PSCs.

We have synthesized and characterized a series of seven acetylide-functionalized phenothiazine-based organic co-poly-ynes. The synthetic procedure we presented affords the co-poly-ynes in moderate to high yields of 28–83%, and the formation of the desired products was confirmed by spectroscopic characterization. GPC indicates molecular weights between 4000–50000 g mol−1, corresponding to degrees of polymerization between 13 and 213, and relatively narrow polydispersity indices of 1.12–1.78.

Optical absorption measurements reveal absorption coefficients in the order of 105 mol−1 cm−1 and optical bandgaps in the range of 1.92–2.63 eV. With the exception of P1 and P4, the materials show emission in solution, with quantum yields in the range of 13–41% relative to rhodamine 6G. Quantum-chemical calculations on the precursor PTZ moiety 4 and model compounds M1–M7 approximating P1–P7 highlight the role of the spacer group and the extended conjugation in the co-poly-ynes on narrowing the bandgap, pushing the absorption into the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum and enhancing the absorption coefficient. The HOMO and LUMO levels were derived from electrochemical measurements of the oxidation and reduction potentials in solution and found to be in the range of 5.26 to 5.44 eV and 3.20 to 3.49 eV, respectively, giving electrochemical band gaps between 1.80–2.09 eV.
Finally, we also assessed the performance of the co-poly-ynes in polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) and bulk heterojunction polymer solar cell (PSC) devices. P7 exhibited the best PLED performance with a peak emission wavelength of 518 nm, maximum current efficiency of 3.34 cd A−1, maximum power efficiency of 3.16 lm W−1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 1.21%. P1 and P4, which did not show emission in solution, were found to show electroluminescent emission at long wavelengths. PSCs fabricated using a 1:1 blend of PCM and P1 exhibited a moderate power conversion efficiency of 0.24%, which might be improved by fabricating and testing devices under an inert atmosphere. The lower PCEs obtained using donors based on the other co-poly-ynes are likely attributable to the LUMO levels being lower than those of the PCBM acceptor (−3.41 eV).
In summary, we find that the extended conjugation in the co-poly-ynes result in strong absorption and emission in the visible region of the spectrum together with a range of electrochemical properties that make these materials suitable for a range of molecular electronic devices. This is confirmed by the demonstration of working PLED devices with green to deep red and near-infrared emission and a functional PSC device that operates with acceptable power-conversion efficiency, obtained without optimization, based on one of the polymers.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of co-poly-ynes incorporating PTZ as the donor molecule for PLED and PSC devices, and our results not only provide a better understanding of the relationship between the structures of the donor–acceptor systems and their optoelectronic properties, but also highlight a flexible route to designing novel PTZ-based co-poly-ynes for organic electronics. Overall, our results shed valuable light on the relationship between the molecular and electronic structure in this family of materials, demonstrating that the optoelectronic properties can be tuned by careful selection of the spacer group for solid-state lighting and solar-energy harvesting.

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to characterize the organic poly-ynes. A Viscotek VE2001 GPCmax instrument equipped with a TDA 305 triple detector array was used, which measures refractive index (RI), light scattering both at right angles and low angles (RALS and LALS respectively) and viscosity. A Viscotek 2600 UV detector was also used. Three Polyanalytik SupeRes™ Series 300 mm × 8 mm linear mixed bed columns with linear polystyrene molar mass ranges of 103 to 106 were used for the analysis. The instrument was operated at 35 °C with a THF flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The absolute number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of the synthesized polymers were obtained by analyzing the chromatograms with the OmniSEC 4.6.1 software. An estimated value of 0.12 for the refractive index increment (dn/dc) was used in all cases.


Molecular quantum-chemical calculations were carried out on the precursor PTZ core 4 and seven finite-chain model compounds M1–M7, approximating P1–P7, each consisting of a chain of three PTZ and two spacer moieties with the terminal alkyne groups capped by methyl substituents. The calculations were performed in the gas phase using the density-functional theory (DFT) formalism implemented in the Gaussian09 software. The calculations used the CAM-B3LYP hybrid functional in conjunction with Pople split-valence basis sets of 6-31g and 6-31g** quality for the H and non-H atoms, respectively. Electronic minimization was performed to tolerances of 10−6 and 10−8 a.u. on the maximum and root-mean-square (RMS) changes in the density matrix, respectively. Geometry optimizations were performed to tolerances of 4.5 × 10−4 and 3 × 10−4 a.u. on the maximum and RMS force and 1.8 × 10−3 and 1.2 × 10−3 a.u. on the maximum and RMS displacements, and the optimized structures were confirmed to be stationary points on the potential-energy surface by the absence of negative eigenvalues in the nuclear hessian matrices. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were performed on the optimized structures to identify the lowest-lying 50 (PTZ) or 150 (M1–M7) singlet and triplet states, and selected states were characterized using the method of natural transition orbitals (NTOs). Visualization of the structures, frontier orbitals and NTOs was performed using the VESTA software.


CV measurements were carried out on the polymer modified GCEs in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/CH3CN solution. For these measurements a standard three-electrode configuration employing a Pt wire counter electrode, a modified GCE working electrode of 3 mm diameter, and an Ag/AgCl non-aqueous reference electrode kit was used (BASi, USA). The Ag/AgCl non-aqueous reference electrode was filled with 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 containing ca. 10 mM AgCl to provide a constant reference potential; this was subsequently corrected using 1.0 mM of the ferrocene/ferrocenium potential in the same electrolyte on the day of use as an internal reference. Measurements were performed at a 100 mV s−1 scan rate at room temperature using a PalmSens3 computer-controlled potentiostat with PSTrace electrochemistry software (PalmSens BV).


Device structures consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/TFB (20 nm)/polymer:PVK (30 nm)/TPBi (20 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated to assess the performance of the co-poly-ynes as PLED emitters. (ITO – indium tin oxide; PEDOT:PSS – poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate); TFB – poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenylamine); PVK – poly(9-vinylcarbazole); TPBi – benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene.) PEDOT:PSS was deposited on the ITO by spin-coating at 3000 rpm under an N2 atmosphere, and the TFB layer was then deposited by spin-coating under the same conditions. Room-temperature solutions of the co-poly-ynes in chlorobenzene were prepared (P1/P3/P5–P7 – 10 mg mL−1, P2/P4 – 5 mg mL−1) and an emissive layer consisting of the polymers in PVK was deposited by spin-coating at 2000 rpm under N2. Concentrations of 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% P7 and 10 wt% P1–P6 in PVK were tested. Finally, a 20 nm TPBi layer, a 1 nm LiF cathode and a 100 nm Al capping layer were deposited on top of the emissive layer through a shadow mask under vacuum (2 × 10−4 Pa). The active area of the devices was 2 mm × 2 mm. The electroluminescence spectra of the devices were measured using an Ocean Optics USB 2000 fiber-optic spectrometer in the normal direction. The J–V–L curves were measured using a dual-channel Keithley 2614B source measure unit and a PIN-25D silicon photodiode. All measurements were conducted at room temperature under ambient conditions.


Device stacks consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/polymer:PCBM (70–110 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated to assess the photovoltaic performance of the co-poly-ynes in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. (ITO – indium tin oxide; PEDOT:PSS – poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate); PCBM – phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester.) [TODO] The active layers were deposited by spin-coating from a 1:1 blend solution (o-dichlorobenzene) of the co-poly-ynes with PCBM with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 at 800–1800 rpm for 60 s, resulting in films with nominal thicknesses of 70–110 nm as determined using a surface profiler (Alfa Step 500, Tencor). After spin-coating, the samples were transferred to an evaporator and the 20 nm Ca and 80 nm Al layers were thermally deposited under vacuum at 10−6 torr to form the top anode. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 236 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 produced by a 91160A-1000 solar simulator (Oriel). The external quantum efficiency was measured at a chopping frequency of 275 Hz using a SR830 lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research) under monochromatic illumination from a xenon lamp.
