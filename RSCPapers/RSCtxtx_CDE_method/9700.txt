A two-dimensional (2D) halogenated thiophene side chain strategy was proposed and two new 2D halogenated electron-rich fused central core units, FBDT and ClBDT, based on linear benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) with fluorinated and chlorinated thiophene side chains have been developed for the first time, respectively. Then, a family of multihalogenated A–D–A structured non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs), namely HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl, based on the same dichlorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) as the terminal group and three different electron-rich central donor cores (a simple thiophene side chain functionalized central donor core HBDT, its fluorinated analogue FBDT, and its chlorinated analogue ClBDT), respectively, were synthesized for high performance organic solar cells. Compared to nonhalogenated analogues, HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibit slightly wider bandgaps and enhanced molar absorption coefficients, slightly down-shifted energy levels, and obviously improved crystallinity in neat thin films. After blending with the polymer donor PBDB-T-2F, the as-cast FBDT-4Cl/PBDB-T-2F blend films show the highest and most balanced hole/electron mobilities, the highest charge dissociation and collection efficiency, and the most proper phase separation feature among these blend films. Thus, the as-cast FBDT-4Cl/PBDB-T-2F based device exhibits the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.36%, which is higher than that of ClBDT-4Cl (11.65%) and HBDT-4Cl (10.35%) based devices owing to the higher Jsc and FF. The PCE of 12.36% is the highest value for fluorinated central core functionalized NF-SMA-based binary organic solar cells. Our results revealed that introduction of halogenated thiophene side chains, especially fluorinated thiophene side chains, in an electron-rich fused central core is an effective strategy to achieve high-performance two-dimensional aromatic side-chain functionalized NF-SMAs.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made great progress owing to their advantageous features such as light weight, low cost, solution-processing ability and large-area fabrication. Recently, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs), especially those having a linear acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone structure, have become the most successful and popular materials for OSCs and have undergone great development due to their merits of easy synthetic accessibility, high intensity and broader absorption, and finely tunable energy levels. So far, the PCE has exceeded 15% for binary bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs and 17% for tandem OSCs, respectively.

Generally, the structure of A–D–A type NF-SMAs can be divided into two parts based on their functions: the central donor core (D) with side chains and electron-withdrawing end groups (A). A number of chemical modifications for these two parts have been adopted to obtain high performance BHJ-OSCs. In principle, no matter how the molecular structure is modified, the key for a high-performance device is to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) through improving the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). Many chemical synthesis strategies have been reported to increase the Jsc through enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect or the light absorption capacity, such as introducing strong electron-withdrawing groups into end groups, introducing strong electron-donating groups into the central donor core and grafting halogen on the molecular skeleton. The improvement of Jsc always occurs along with a sacrifice of Voc. Hence, for high performance of OSCs, it is important to consider the trade-off between the Voc and Jsc. Excitingly, some efforts have been devoted to achieving a balance between Voc and Jsc through modifying the end groups and central donor core. The modifications of end groups include altering the aromatic ring and introducing methyl groups, such as BDCPDT-TTIC and BTTIC-2M. However, methods for improving the Jsc without sacrificing Voc excessively seem to be less common. Therefore, it is important and necessary to find a new chemical modification strategy for the core unit to improve the Jsc without drastic fluctuation of Voc.
On the other hand, halogens, especially fluorine and chlorine, have been widely introduced into end-groups of NF-SMAs owing to the improved absorption ability and the increased crystallinity, which are conducive to achieving higher PCE in comparison with their non-halogenated counterparts. In addition, in the case of modification of the central donor core, Zhu and co-workers reported NF-SMAs (NSTI) with fluorine-substituted bis-silicon-bridged stilbene as a central donor core, which achieved the highest PCE of 10.3%, while Chen, Li and co-workers proposed un-fused NF-SMAs (DF-PCIC) with fluorine-substituted core units, which showed nearly planar geometry through F–H noncovalent interactions, exhibiting a PCE of 10.14%. In fact, grafting halogen on end-group and the central donor core are two different strategies, and they can be selectively employed according to their respective advantages, resulting in further optimization of the efficiency of the device. For example, Chen and co-workers reported NF-SMAs (HF–PCIC) with F atoms at both the core unit and end-groups, achieving a PCE of 11.49%. However, compared to grafting halogen on the end-groups, the strategy of introducing halogen into the central core in NF-SMAs still requires in-depth investigation. Moreover, to date, although halogens can be attached into the end groups and core unit of NF-SMAs, the modified position is still focused on the linear one-dimensional skeleton of NF-SMAs, which might lead to the limitation of the contribution of halogens on improvement of device performance in NF-SMAs.
In 2017, Chen and co-workers reported for the first time the one-dimensional skeleton of NFA (NFBDT) based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) electron-rich unit, which showed an optimized PCE of 10.4%. Subsequently, Zhan and co-workers introduced the two-dimensional (2D) conjugated side-chain moiety into benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-based A–D–A-type NF-SMAs to enhance the absorption and charge transport and obtained an improved PCE of 11%. After that, a series of 2D side chain functionalized NF-SMAs were reported, which explored the influence of various simple 2D side chains on the performance of NF-SMAs, such as NOBDT, BDTThIT-M, FNIC1, FNIC2 and so on. Meanwhile, introducing halogens into the two-dimensional side chains has been widely used in the design of polymer donors and has been a meaningful method to tune the structure–property relationships of polymer donors well and achieve high performance OSCs. For example, the 2D fluorinated thiophene side chain-based polymer PBDB-T-2F (also named PM6) and 2D chlorinated thiophene side chain-based polymer PBDB-T-2Cl (also named PM7) exhibited much better crystallinity and improved electron mobility in comparison with the non-halogenated analogue PBDB-T, leading to a higher FF and PCE. Such features encourage us to design high performance NF-SMAs by using halogenated 2D side chain functionalized core units. Although several 2D halogenated thiophene side chain functionalized donor units have been reported for polymers, to the best of our knowledge, halogenated NF-SMAs with halogenated π-conjugated side chain functionalized central donor cores have never been reported for NFA-based solar cells due to the difficulty of synthesis. Therefore, to extend the scope of the 2D aromatic side-chain concept, it is necessary to synthesize a series of 2D oriented halogenated aromatic side chain functionalized core unit-based NF-SMAs and systematically explore the influence of different halogen substitutions of side chains on the electronic properties of neat films, morphology of blend films, and photovoltaic performance of the 2D aromatic side chain functionalized core unit-based NF-SMAs blended with donor polymers.
Herein, for the first time, we designed and synthesized two 2D electron-rich fused ring core units, FBDT and ClBDT, with fluorinated thiophene side chains and chlorinated thiophene side chains linked to linear benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) electron-rich units, respectively. Then, a series of NF-SMAs based on dichlorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) as end groups, namely HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl, and ClBDT-4Cl (see Fig. 1a), with a distinct 2D oriented nonhalogenated or halogenated aromatic side chain functionalized fused ring unit (HBDT, FBDT, and ClBDT) as the central electron-donating core, are designed and successfully synthesized for use in organic solar cells. We systematically studied the effect of introducing F atoms and Cl atoms into the 2D side chains of NF-SMAs on the absorption spectrum, LUMO/HOMO energy levels, and morphology and device performance of blend films. HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibited a strong and broad absorption (600–870 nm) with narrow optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.43 eV, 1.45 eV and 1.44 eV, respectively. Compared with their counterpart HBDT-4Cl, the fluorinated analogue NF-SMA FBDT-4Cl and chlorinated analogue NF-SMA ClBDT-4Cl exhibited higher intensity of absorbance, a slightly down-shifted HOMO energy level, and obviously improved crystallinity in neat thin films. With the wide bandgap polymer donor PBDB-T-2F, the as-cast devices based on HBDT-4Cl/FBDT-4Cl/ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F exhibited almost the same Voc because of the similar LUMO energy levels of these NF-SMAs. It is noted that the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend film showed not only a higher and more balanced hole/electron mobility but also more suitable morphology for efficient charge transportation, resulting in enhanced Jsc and FF in comparison with HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films. Finally, the device based on FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F achieved a PCE of 12.36%, which is obviously higher than that of the ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F-based device (11.65%) and dramatically higher than that of HBDT-4Cl (10.35%). It is worth noting that the PCE of 12.36% is the highest value for fluorinated central donor core unit modified NF-SMA based binary organic solar cells. Our results demonstrated that the use of a halogenated thiophene side chain functionalized central donor core is an effective strategy for simultaneously enhancing Jsc and FF, shedding light on the further improvement of performance for two-dimensional aromatic side-chain functionalized NF-SMAs.

The synthetic routes of the halogenated cores (FBDT and ClBDT) and nonfullerene acceptors (HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl) are depicted in Scheme 1. Compound 2a (or 2b) was obtained by the Stille coupling reaction between ditin reagent 1a (or 1b) and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate in 81% (or 78%) yield. The halogenated fused central cores FBDT and ClBDT were synthesized via a double nucleophilic addition reaction between (4-hexylphenyl)lithium and compound 2a (or 2b) followed by p-toluenesulfonic acid-catalyzed intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization with a total yield of 67% and 60%, respectively. FBDT-CHO (or ClBDT-CHO) was prepared from FBDT (or ClBDT) with the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction in a high isolated yield of 94%. Finally, the Knoevenagel condensation of dialdehydes FBDT-CHO, ClBDT-CHO and HBDT-CHO with IC-2Cl in chloroform afforded the NF-SMAs HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl in 86%, 86% and 88% yield, respectively. The three NF-SMAs and all the intermediates were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF-MS/ESI-MS (see the ESI). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to investigate their thermal stability under a nitrogen atmosphere and the results are shown in Fig. S1. The TGA plots of HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl indicated decomposition temperatures at 5% weight-loss of 373 °C, 378 °C and 381 °C, respectively, which demonstrated that the thermal stabilities of HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl are suitable for OSC devices.

Density functional theory calculations for HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl were performed using Gaussian at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G (d,p) level to understand the effects of the introduction of F atoms and Cl atoms into 2D side chain functionalized core units on orbital distributions and energy levels of NF-SMAs. The long alkyl chains were changed to methyl groups to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. S2,HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl showed a highly planar structure owing to the planarity of the fused ring core unit. For the three molecules, the LUMO delocalized on the whole backbone and the HOMO localized mainly on the central core units. So when introducing F atoms and Cl atoms into the 2D side chain functionalized core unit, the HOMO energy levels can be changed significantly. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels are −5.71/−3.75 eV for HBDT-4Cl, −5.80/−3.81 eV for FBDT-4Cl, and −5.81/−3.82 eV for ClBDT-4Cl. These results suggest that introducing F atoms and Cl atoms into 2D side chains of NF-SMAs can slightly influence the energy levels and thus slightly increase the bandgap of NF-SMAs.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorptions of HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl in chloroform solutions and thin films were measured for comparison and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. S3a,HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibited broad absorption in the region of 630–780 nm with the maximum absorption peaks at 740, 728 and 728 nm in chloroform solutions, respectively. Compared with HBDT-4Cl (an average extinction coefficient of 1.81 × 105 M−1 cm−1), FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibited a slightly higher average extinction coefficient of 2.13 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 2.22 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively, which might be ascribed to the hyperchromic effect of halogen atoms. These results demonstrated that the introduction of halogen atoms into the 2D side chain functionalized core unit can enhance the absorbance intensity, contributing to the photocurrent. The thin film spectra of these NF-SMAs are shown in Fig. 1b. HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibited obviously redshifted absorption compared to their corresponding diluted solutions with the maximum absorption peak at 798, 788 and 789 nm, respectively. In addition, the optical bandgaps of HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl were estimated from their absorption edge of the thin film to be 1.43, 1.45 and 1.44 eV, respectively. FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibited slightly larger optical band gaps and blue-shifted maximum absorption peaks in comparison with HBDT-4Cl, which is ascribed to weaker intramolecular charge transfer due to the stronger electronegativity of F and Cl atoms on the 2D thiophene side chains of core units compared to simple thiophene side chains.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment was used to investigate the electrochemical properties of HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl in thin films under the same experimental conditions and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1c, HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibited quasi-reversible reduction waves and oxidation waves and the corresponding potentials were calibrated using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using the onset oxidation and reduction potentials (ϕox/red) according to the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e(ϕox/red − ϕferrocene + 4.8) (eV). The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl were calculated to be −5.65 eV/–3.90 eV, −5.70 eV/–3.91 eV, and −5.72 eV/–3.92 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. S3b,HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl showed almost similar LUMO energy levels, while FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl exhibited obviously lower HOMO energy levels than HBDT-4Cl, which is ascribed to the electron withdrawing effect of fluorine and chlorine substitution on the 2D thiophene side chains compared to simple thiophene side chains. When matching NF-SMAs with PBDB-T-2F, FBDT-4Cl/PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl/PBDB-T-2F showed larger energy offsets than HBDT-4Cl/PBDB-T-2F, which contributed to the exciton dissociation and improved Jsc.
The photovoltaic performance of HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl as electron acceptor materials was explored by incorporating polymer PBDB-T-2F as donor materials to fabricate bulk-heterojunction solar cells with a traditional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/acceptor:donor/amino N-oxide perylene diimide (PDINO)/Al, where PDINO was used as the cathode interfacial layer. All active layers were processed using the as-cast chlorobenzene solution by optimizing spin-coating parameters and altering D:A blend ratios (Table S1–S6 in the ESI). The typical current density–voltage characteristic (J–V) curves and photovoltaic parameters of the as-cast blend films are shown in Fig. 2a and Table 2, respectively. We can see that the devices based on HBDT-4Cl/FBDT-4Cl/ClBDT-4Cl exhibit almost similar Voc, but obvious differences in Jsc and FF. Specifically, the HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based devices achieve a PCE of 10.35% with a Jsc of 17.79 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.898 eV and FF of 64.76%. Interestingly, when using the fluorinated analogue FBDT-4Cl or chlorinated analogue ClBDT-4Cl as electron acceptors, the PCEs were improved to 12.36% and 11.65%, with a Jsc of 19.83/19.02 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.19%/69.71%, respectively. The higher PCEs of FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F or ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based devices mainly originate from the improved Jsc and FF compared with that of the non-halogenated 2D side chain analogue HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based device, which might be due to the enhanced molar absorption coefficient, higher HOMO offset and larger driving force for generating charge transfer. Furthermore, on going from the fluorinated analogue FBDT-4Cl to the chlorinated analogue ClBDT-4Cl, the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based device exhibited a higher PCE than the ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based device owing to the higher Jsc and FF, which is mainly ascribed to the better crystallinity of these blend films (discussed below). The PCE of 12.36% is the highest PCE among binary PSCs with fluorinated central fused electron-rich core functionalized non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (see Table S7, Fig. S4, ESI). These results suggest that the introduction of halogen atoms into 2D aromatic side chains in NF-SMAs can improve the Jsc and FF without sacrificing Voc excessively. Meanwhile, energy loss (Eloss) is one of the most important parameters for PSCs. Thus, we calculated the Eloss according to the equation Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc, where Eoptg is the optical band gap of NF-SMAs. Notably, the devices based on HBDT-4Cl/FBDT-4Cl/ClBDT-4Cl exhibit small Eloss values of 0.53, 0.56 and 0.56 eV, respectively. In addition, the devices based on FBDT-4Cl/ClBDT-4Cl show slightly larger Eloss values than the HBDT-4Cl-based device owing to larger energy offsets in HOMO energy levels.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the as-cast devices based on HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F, FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F were measured. As shown in Fig. 2b, the HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based devices displayed a broader but weaker photoresponse from 300–865 nm than the halogenated analogues (FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F, from 300–860 nm), which is consistent with the range of absorption for the three NF-SMAs. For the two halogenated analogues, both devices exhibited similar absorption trends, but a higher EQE value (over 60%) from 440–800 nm was observed in FBDT-4Cl-based devices in comparison with ClBDT-4Cl-based devices. Such a high value of EQE in FBDT-4Cl based devices compared to ClBDT-4Cl based devices may be ascribed to the higher electron mobility (the details are discussed below) in blend films, which is beneficial for charge dissociation and transportation. In addition, as listed in Table 2, the Jsc values for all of these devices calculated by the integration of EQE curves with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum exhibited a good match with the Jsc values measured from the J–V curves within a reasonable mismatch.
To further understand the charge transport ability of these devices, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of these blend films were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5). The HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend film showed a μh of 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 1.22 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend film exhibited a slightly higher μh of 1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an obviously higher μe of 3.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 4.04. In comparison, the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend film exhibited the highest μe of 4.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the most balanced μh/μe ratio of 2.36, which is beneficial for suppressing charge recombination, resulting in a higher FF. These results demonstrated that the introduction of F atoms and Cl atoms into 2D aromatic side chains might promote intermolecular interactions, which leads to the increase of electron mobilities of these blend films.
To examine the influence of the different 2D side chain functionalized electron-rich central core based NF-SMAs on charge generation, transportation, and extraction properties, we plotted the photocurrent (Jph) curves versus the effective applied voltage (Veff) for these as-cast devices, in which Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively; Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the applied voltage when Jph is zero and Va is the applied voltage. From Fig. 2c, we can see that the Jph for all three devices gradually reached saturation at a high Veff, suggesting that the exciton dissociation and charge collection are both efficient. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) was determined using P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit current condition to be 94.3%, 96.3% and 96.1% for HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F, FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F devices, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat ratios of FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based devices suggest that introducing F atoms and Cl atoms into the 2D aromatic side chains may promote exciton dissociation and charge collection, thus leading to higher Jsc and FF of these as-cast devices. The relationship between the Jsc of HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F, FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films and different light intensities (P) was further analyzed to explored the charge recombination properties in these NF-SMA-based devices. The equation Jph ∝ Pα can describe the relationship between Jsc and P, where the exponential factor (α) represents the recombination parameter. Generally, a value of α equal to 1 indicates that all free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes before recombination, while α < 1 indicates that some degree of bimolecular recombination occurs. As shown in Fig. 2d, the values of α for the as-cast HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F, FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F based devices are 0.91, 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. The highest value of 0.95 of the as-cast FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F implied that the weakest bimolecular recombination and effective charge transport occurred in this device, which was consistent with the trend of Jsc and FF.
The morphological features of HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F, FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the AFM height images (Fig. 3a–c), we observed smooth uniform surfaces for all three blend films. The HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend film shows a surface with a relatively small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 2.21 nm, which suggests good miscibility between PBDB-T-2F and HBDT-4Cl when they blend. In contrast, the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films both show relatively larger RMS values, 2.44 and 2.42 nm, respectively, which probably correlate with the enhanced phase separation induced by FBDT-4Cl or ClBDT-4Cl with improved crystallinity. For this reason, the electron mobilities of these two blend films were both larger than that of the PBDB-T-2F:HBDT-4Cl blend film. Meanwhile, along with the variation of the crystalline behavior of FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl during film formation, the aggregation state of polymer donors may also evolve, which can be studied by TEM observation. Fig. 3g–i show the morphological changes in bulk films based on the three blends. Despite the similar fibrous and/or flocculent structures observed within all three blend films, the interpenetrating network forms better in the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend film than in other films, which features very distinct nano-scale fibril-like polymer domains. Such fibril-like polymer domains disperse well in the whole blend film and may reduce the continuity between donor domains due to the isolation of adjacent acceptor domains, which may be the reason for its relatively low μh. We induced crystallinity changes by introducing F atoms and Cl atoms into the 2D aromatic side chains of NF-SMAs and thereby attributed their different performances to the variation of the phase separation state, which was further examined via the crystallography method.
To investigate the effect of introduced F or Cl atoms into the 2D side chains of NF-SMAs on their crystallinity and packing states, two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. S6, the pure HBDT-4Cl film exhibited less-defined diffraction peaks, which reveals its highly amorphous nature and disordered packing. FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl pristine films exhibit similar lamellar packing (100) peaks at ca. 0.28 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction and obvious π–π stacking (010) diffraction peaks at 1.81 Å−1 and 1.80 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, which respectively correspond to π–π stacking distances of 3.47 Å and 3.49 Å. These results indicated that the introduction of halogen atoms into the 2D thiophene side chains of NF-SMAs induces evolution of the packing patterns from amorphous to face-on orientation. As for the polymer donor, the pure PBDB-T-2F film shows a sharp (100) diffraction peak at 0.30 Å−1 and a clear (010) diffraction peak at 1.69 Å−1 in the OOP direction, which also implies a predominant face-on orientation. As shown in Fig. 4, the HBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend film exhibits a moderate (010) diffraction peak at 1.68 Å−1 in the OOP direction, corresponding to a crystal coherence length (CL) of 1.29 nm, which merged with the (010) diffraction peaks of HBDT-4Cl and PBDB-T-2F. These results indicated that the presence of HBDT-4Cl in the blend film might affect the crystallinity of PBDB-T-2F in the “face-on” orientation. In contrast, the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F and ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films show stronger (100) and (010) diffraction peaks, suggesting improved face-on orientation and enhanced molecule packing and crystallization, which also merged with the diffraction peaks of FBDT-4Cl/ClBDT-4Cl and PBDB-T-2F. In detail, the ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films show two diffraction peaks at 1.70 Å−1 and 0.30 Å−1, corresponding to (010) π–π stacking and (100) lamellar packing with d-values of 3.69 Å and 20.8 Å and CL values of 1.41 nm and 11.3 nm, respectively. For FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films, the (010) and (100) diffraction peaks appear at 1.74 Å−1 and 0.31 Å−1, which correspond to a π–π stacking of 3.61 Å and a lamellar distance of 20.1 Å. The CL values for these two peaks are 1.95 nm and 12.0 nm, respectively. Comparatively, the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F blend films show enhanced crystallinity, more favorable face-on orientation, and reduced π–π and lamellar stacking with enlarged coherence length compared to other films, which enhances the charge transfer, suppresses the bimolecular recombination, and results in the highest Jsc and FF. These results demonstrate that introducing halogen atoms into 2D thiophene side chains of NF-SMAs is a promising strategy towards fine-tuned crystallinity and molecular packing.

In conclusion, a series of two-dimensional thiophene side-chain functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-based multihalogenated NF-SMAs, HBDT-4Cl, FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl, were designed and synthesized by employing nonhalogenated or halogenated thiophene side chains attached to linear benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) as electron-rich fused central donor units and dichlorinated IC as end groups. The effect of introducing F atoms and Cl atoms into 2D thiophene side chains on absorption, energy levels and crystallinity of neat films and charge mobilities, morphologies and photovoltaic performance of blend films was systematically investigated. After introducing F atoms and Cl atoms into 2D thiophene side chains, the corresponding FBDT-4Cl and ClBDT-4Cl showed slightly blue-shifted peaks but higher absorption coefficient and obviously improved molecular packing compared with HBDT-4Cl. Our halogenated two-dimensional side-chain design strategy led to a large Jsc and FF while slightly sacrificing the Voc in these blend films. The device based on FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F achieved a PCE of 12.36%, which is distinctly higher than that of the ClBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F-based device (11.65%) and remarkably higher than that of HBDT-4Cl (10.35%), owing to higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities and better phase separation features. This is the first time that hydrogen, fluorine and chlorine substituents have been systematically varied in a family of halogenated 2D thiophene side chain functionalized core unit-based NF-SMAs. It is noted that the best PCE of the FBDT-4Cl:PBDB-T-2F device is the highest value for NF-SMAs with a fluorinated fused central core in binary organic solar cells. Our results demonstrated that halogen-substituted 2D thiophene side chain engineering is a promising method for delicate molecular design and modification of two-dimensional side-chain functionalized NF-SMAs for high performance organic solar cells.
