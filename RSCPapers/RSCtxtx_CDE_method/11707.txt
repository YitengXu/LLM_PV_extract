A new benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) building block with 4,8-disubstitution using 2-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the substituent has been designed and synthesized. The new building block has been copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) and 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (fBT) by Suzuki and Stille coupling polymerization to synthesize donor–acceptor conjugated polymers. The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized copolymers were studied. Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using the donor–acceptor copolymers in conjunction with PC71BM and exhibited up to 4.20% power conversion efficiency.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells consisting of a blend of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene acceptor as the photoactive layer have attracted considerable attention in the last decade. Material innovation, especially the development of the conjugated polymer donor, is one of the major forces that has driven the improvements in device performance achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 9%.

Among various conjugated polymers developed for BHJ solar cells, the two-dimensional conjugated (“2D conjugated”) polymers, in which conjugated side chains are orthogonally attached to the polymer backbone, are particularly interesting due to their superior optical and electrical properties. One of the most successful examples of this concept has been demonstrated on polymers containing the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) building block on their backbone. The “2D conjugated” polymers exhibited red-shifted absorption spectra, significantly higher hole mobility, and greatly improved photovoltaic properties, in comparison with the two alkoxy substituted polymer analogues.
Meanwhile, extending the fused-ring systems along the polymer backbone can also lead to enhancement in the optical absorption profile, charge carrier mobility, and BHJ solar cell performance. In a polymer system containing the dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (Fig. 1) building block, it was hypothesised that the device performance improvement was a result of lower positive charge density and exciton binding energy. In another system, the π-conjugation of the indacenodithiophene unit was extended by incorporating thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units to form the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene donor moiety (Fig. 1) which had longer effective conjugation and better planarity resulting in improved charge mobility. Dithienogermole has also been extended by incorporating thieno[3,2-b]thiophene with the aim of enforcing coplanarity, reducing rotational disorder, lowering reorganization energy and increasing charge carrier mobility (Fig. 1).
In BHJ polymer solar cells, BDT based copolymers are among the most frequently used donor materials. A number of dithienyl-BDT containing polymers have been used in high performance solar cell devices (Fig. 1). In this study, the orthogonal thiophene units on the BDT core were replaced by thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units (Fig. 1). It was envisaged that the introduction of two alkyl chains on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units would provide the solution processability required for material characterisation and device fabrication. Extending the fused ring system in the 2D direction is expected to broaden the light absorption of the material with enhanced high energy absorption bands. In addition, the 2D conjugation would allow the delocalization of holes over the side chain, thus lowering the local charge density and the Coulombic interactions between the hole and the electron in the donor–acceptor interface. Compared with extending the fused-ring systems along the polymer backbone, the extending of a fused ring in the side chains could also maintain the solubility and processability of the conjugated polymers. To achieve a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and thus the high open circuit voltage (Voc), benzothiadiazole (BT) and 5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (fBT) were used as the acceptor units for the synthesis of the donor–acceptor conjugated polymers.

The synthetic route for preparing the 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene) BDT monomers is shown in Scheme 1. 2-(2-Ethylhexyl)-3-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene 7 was obtained by Kumada coupling of 2-bromo-3-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene 6 and 2-ethylhexyl bromide with the catalyst of Pd(dppf)Cl2. After deprotonation with butyl lithium, compound 7 was treated with 4,8-dihydrobenzene[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dione and then reduced with tin(II) chloride to give BDT 8 in 72% yield. Compound 8 was converted into the diiodo monomer 10 or bistrimethylstannyl monomer 9 with n-butyl lithium and then iodine or trimethyltin chloride.

The copolymerization of the diiodo monomer 10 and the BT monomer 11 by Suzuki coupling polymerization was very efficient (Scheme 2). The polymerization time of 0.5 hour was enough for a high MW polymer and further increase of the polymerization time leads to a large quantity of insoluble polymer. The resulting polymer was purified by precipitation from methanol and subsequent Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexane, dichloromethane, and chloroform. The fBT monomer 12 is not stable under the hot basic conditions employed in the Suzuki coupling polymerization, so the fBT monomer 12 was copolymerized with the bistrimethylstannyl monomer 9 by Stille coupling polymerization (Scheme 2). In comparison with the Suzuki coupling polymerization, the Stille coupling polymerization was much slower and took 2 days. The resulting polymer P2 was purified in a similar way to that of the polymer P1. The yields of P1 and P2 were 43% and 39%, respectively. Polymers P1 and P2 were soluble in chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, but not soluble in acetone, toluene, hexane or acetonitrile. The molecular weight and polydispersity (PDI) of the polymers were determined by high temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in trichlorobenzene at 120 °C (Fig. S1 and S2). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P1 and P2 were 28900 and 10500 g mol−1, respectively. Thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). No significant thermal transitions were observed in DSC analysis in the range of 40 to 300 °C for both polymers (Fig. S3).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform are shown in Fig. 2a. Both polymers exhibited broad absorption from 300 nm to 700 nm. The absorption maximum (λmax) of P1 was located at 648 nm and the onset absorption (λonset) was at 731 nm (Table 1). Polymer P2 showed slightly red shifted λonset due to the more electron withdrawing properties of the fBT unit (the λmax and λonset of P2 were at 644 and 740 nm, respectively). The longest wavelength absorption band could be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the acceptor units and the donor BDT units in the main chain. A significant difference of the absorptions of the two polymers was that P2 displayed a stronger absorption peak at 501 nm. P2 had a lower molecular weight and a stronger electron push–pull property between the BDT unit and the difluoro substituted fBT unit, so the peak at 501 nm was more obvious than that of the P1.

P1 and P2 showed solid film absorptions similar to their solution absorptions (Fig. 2b). Compared with the solution absorption, the λmax of the P1 film only red-shifted 4 nm. The relatively low red-shift indicated that the polymers had a rigid-rod confirmation in both solution and solid states. The λmax of the P2 film red-shifted 13 nm suggesting aggregation and higher ordering in the solid state. By extrapolating the absorption edges of the film absorption, the λonset of the P1 and P2 films was determined to be 740 nm and 747 nm, respectively. This corresponds to optical energy gaps of 1.68 eV for P1 and 1.66 eV for P2 (Table 1). P1 and P2 showed solution fluorescence emission maximum at 720 and 707 nm, respectively, when photo-excited at 650 nm. Very weak solid film fluorescence emission was recorded at 725 and 716 nm for P1 and P2 films, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S4).
Electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three-electrode cell with a glass carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ pseudo reference electrode (Fig. 3). Ferrocene was used as the internal reference. The measurements were performed in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Film samples were prepared by drop-casting o-dichlorobenzene solutions of the polymers onto the glass carbon electrode. Polymer P1 showed an irreversible oxidation peak at around 0.98 V, while P2 displayed a slight higher irreversible oxidation peak of 1.02 V (Fig. 3). The onset potentials of the oxidation were used to calculate the HOMO energy levels for the polymers. Using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as the reference (4.8 eV below vacuum), the HOMO energy levels of the P1 and P2 were determined at −5.46 and −5.50 eV, respectively. The onset reduction potentials were used to calculate the LUMO energy levels which were at −3.61 and −3.68 eV for P1 and P2, respectively (Table 1). The HOMO–LUMO energy gap measured from these electrochemical experiments was slightly larger than the optical energy gap (Table 1). From the CV measurement results, both polymers showed low lying HOMO energy levels which is good for achieving high Voc solar cells. The introduction of the fluorine atom only caused a small perturbation in the HOMO energy level of the resulting polymer.

The photovoltaic device performance of polymers P1 and P2 was investigated. A schematic diagram of the solar cells with inverted device architecture [ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag] is shown in Fig. 4a. o-Dichlorobenzene (oDCB) was chosen as the processing solvent due to its good solvent properties and low evaporation rates. An optimized blend ratio of polymer/PC71BM 1:2 was used for spin coating of the active layer. The blend film absorption is shown in Fig. S5. The devices were studied under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The current density to voltage (J–V) curves of the polymer/PC71BM devices are displayed in Fig. 4b and the photovoltaic performance is listed in Table 2. The P1:PC71BM (1:2) devices showed an average PCE of 2.6% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a fill factor (FF) of 42%, and a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.8 mA cm−2. The use of a solvent additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), was found to be very effective in improving the device performance. With 2.5% (volume ratio) of DIO in the processing solvent oDCB, the BHJ solar cell performance increased by 40% with a greatly improved Jsc of 10.2 mA cm−2 leading to PCE of 3.90% (Table S1). The increasing of the Jsc and the FF could be due to the improved morphology as evidenced by morphology studies (vide infra). Thermal annealing of the DIO processed solar cells at 120 °C for 3 minutes further increased the PCE to 4.20% (Table 2).

The P2:PC71BM (1:2) based solar cells showed lower performance compared to the P1 devices with PCE of 1% (Table 2). The introduction of two fluorine atoms to the polymer unit indeed increased the Voc and the results were consistent with the HOMO energy levels obtained by CV studies. However, the Jsc and the FF of the devices were low. Solvent additive (DIO) and thermal annealing were also tested in the P2:PC71BM device (Table 2). However, the influence of the solvent additive was not as significant as in the P1 based solar cells.
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the solar cell devices were also studied. Fig. 4c shows the EQE curves of the solar cells fabricated under the same optimized conditions as those used for the J–V measurements. Clearly, the EQE values for P1 are higher than those of P2 based solar cells, which agree with the higher Jsc values of the devices derived from P1.
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was conducted to study the hole and electron mobility of the polymer/PC71BM blend films (Fig. S7 and S8). Hole only and electron only devices were fabricated (see ESI for details). According to the Mott–Gurney law, SCLC theory can be described as J = 9ε0εrμ(V − Vbi)2/8d3, where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, μ is the mobility, V is the applied voltage, Vbi is the built-in voltage, and d is the thickness of the active film. By this method, the hole mobility of the P1:PC71BM (1:2) blend film was determined to be 1.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 which was higher than that of the P2:PC71BM (1:2) blend film (6.9 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. S7). The electron mobility of the blend films was similar in the 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 range (Fig. S8). This means that the charge transport in the P1:PC71BM film was more balanced than that of the P2:PC71BM film. The result correlated to the higher Jsc obtained from the P1 based solar cell devices.
The surface morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend films was investigated using a tapping mode AFM and the images are shown in Fig. 5. Compared to the blend film of P2:PC71BM which gave lower FF and Jsc, the P1:PC71BM blend film displayed a clear, phase-separated morphology on the nanometre scale. Nanometre phase separation is thought to be good for charge separation and transport as evidenced in many high performance polymers. The blend film of P1:PC71BM with DIO as a solvent additive was also studied which gave even more evident phase separation. The percolated biphasic structure showed domain sizes in several tens of nanometres. Such phase separated film morphology should contain large donor–acceptor interface for exciton dissociation, small-enough domains that ensure all the photogenerated excitons have chances to move to donor–acceptor interface, and effective transportation pathways for both hole and electron carriers. The changes induced by addition of DIO could be due to the preferential interaction of DIO with the alkyl substituents of the benzodithiophene repeat unit which affects the morphology of the blends.

A new BDT unit, 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene) BDT, was designed, synthesized, and applied for the construction of donor–acceptor conjugated copolymers. Compared with the polymers with extended fused-ring systems along the polymer backbone, the newly synthesized polymers featured extending fused-ring systems in a 2D manner by substituting thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene. Copolymerization of the new BDT unit with BT or fBT provided polymers with abroad absorption in the visible light region and low-lying HOMO energy levels. Application of these polymers in BHJ solar cells provided high Voc of 0.90 V and optimization of the solar cells by solvent additives gave PCE of 4.20%. This is close to the performance of the dithienyl-BDT analogue of similar molecular weight range. Compared with the fused dithienobenzodithiophene system, polymer P1 showed reasonable performance indicating that using fused ring units orthogonal to the polymer backbone is a promising strategy for future polymer design.

Polymer solar cells were processed on pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω per square. First a 30 nm thick layer of ZnO nanoparticle was deposited on the ultrasonically cleaned ITO substrates by spin coating (25 mg mL−1 in ethanol, 3000 rpm). ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by a sol–gel method using zinc acetate dihydrate and tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The active layer of the devices was deposited by spin coating oDCB solution containing 10 mg of polymer and 20 mg of PC71BM. The films were then transferred to a metal evaporation chamber and MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were deposited through a shadow mask (active area was 0.1 cm2) at approximately 1 × 10−6 torr. Film thickness was determined by Veeco Dektak 150+ Surface Profiler. The current density–voltage measurements of the devices were carried out using a 1 kW Oriel solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter as the light source in conjunction with a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. Solar measurements were carried out under 1000 W m−2 AM 1.5 G illumination conditions. For accurate measurement, the light intensity was calibrated using a reference silicon solar cell (PV Measurements Inc.) certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
