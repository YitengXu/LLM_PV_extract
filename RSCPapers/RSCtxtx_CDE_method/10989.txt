We designed and synthesized a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) molecule with a fully-planar molecular geometry, 3,6-bis{5-[(ethylfuran-2-carboxylate)-2-yl]thiophene-2-yl}-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP(CF)2), for solution-processable organic solar cells (OSCs). It is theoretically calculated that the dihedral angles between the two furan-2-carboxylate end-groups and the DPP core are both only 0.56°. Due to this negligible steric distortion, the molecular conformation of DPP(CF)2 can be considered fully coplanar, leading to a higher crystallinity for the DPP(CF)2 film. As a result, the hole mobility of DPP(CF)2 is one order of magnitude higher than that of the DPP derivative with thiophene-2-carboxylate as the end-group (DPP(CT)2). DPP(CF)2 exhibits both a low optical band gap (Eg) of 1.60 eV and a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.33 eV, implying that DPP(CF)2 is a promising electron donor for OSCs. OSCs with DPP(CF)2 or DPP(CT)2 as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor were fabricated. It is found that the DPP(CF)2-based devices exhibit much better photovoltaic performance than the DPP(CT)2-based devices, with the highest power conversion efficiency of 5.37% and a short-circuit current density of 11.4 mA cm−2. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the superior charge-transporting ability of DPP(CF)2 due to its fully-planar molecular geometry.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous scientific and industrial interest in recent years due to their promising advantages, such as low-cost, a simple manufacturing process, flexibility, and light weight. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure which involves a blend of an organic electron donor (conjugated polymers or small molecules) and an electron acceptor ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or other fullerene derivatives) has emerged as a robust way to fabricate high-performance OSCs. In the last decade, the PCE of OSCs has rapidly improved, which can be mainly attributed to the development of many high performance polymer donors with near ideal optical and electronic properties. Meanwhile, OSCs with small molecules as electron donors also received increasing attention due to the advantages of easy synthesis and purification, well-defined structures, absence of end group contaminants, high charge carrier mobility, and better batch-to-batch reproducibility. Through persistent investigations by scientists, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8% has been achieved for small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs). For instance, Chen and co-workers have achieved a PCE of 8.12% by developing a series of novel small molecule donors, with a benzodithiophene core, a terthiophene spacer, and a rhodamine end-group. Very recently, Bazan et al. reported an OSC based on the small molecule donor of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 (ref. 21–23) and found that the barium cathode layer can significantly enhance the fill factor (FF) of the device via increasing the charge collection at the cathode. Ultimately the PCE is improved to 9.02% and is the record value for SMOSCs.

Nowadays, several strategies to design organic donors for high-performance OSCs have been established: (1) to form a conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) molecular backbone to achieve broad and strong light absorptions in the visible and near-infrared regions, (2) to incorporate planar molecular structures which are closely packed for crystallization to enhance the charge carrier mobility and yield a large short-circuit current (JSC), and (3) to realize a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to ensure a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and a suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level to provide a sufficient energy offset for efficient exciton dissociation.
Since first reported by Nguyen and co-workers, the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit, with two fused electron-deficient lactams, has been widely used to design D–A polymers and small molecules for applications in the optoelectronic field. The thienyl groups chemically decorated at 3,6-positions of the lactam improve intramolecular π-electron delocalization and π–π intermolecular interactions, leading to intense absorptions in the visible region. In the last few years, significant progress has been made for the application of DPP-containing materials in semiconductors. Liu's group reported two donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole and (E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene (TVT) units for solution-processed field-effect transistors (FETs), with a highest hole mobility of 8.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. A linear solution-processable small molecule based on 5-alkylthiophene-2-yl-substituted benzodithiophene and DPP was reported by two different groups, and the resulting OSCs show PCEs of 5.79% (ref. 31) and 5.29%, respectively. Recently, our group designed a DPP molecule end-capped with two thiophene-2-carboxylate moieties (DPP(CT)2), which owns appropriate energy levels (both a narrow band gap and a low-lying HOMO) as the donor in SMOSCs. The DPP(CT)2-based OSCs gave a PCE of 4.02%. We found that the relatively low hole mobility of DPP(CT)2 is one of the main reasons for the moderate device performance. Nguyen and co-workers presented that changing heteroatom substitutions in the aromatic end-groups may significantly affect their thermal properties, solubility, crystallinity, film morphology, charge carrier mobility, and solar cell performance. Therefore, to obtain high performance SMOSCs, in this work, while retaining the ester functionalization to tune its solubility and energy level, we replace thiophene-2-carboxylate with a furan-2-carboxylate unit to design a new DPP derivative, 3,6-bis{5-[(ethyl furan-2-carboxylate)-2-yl]thiophene-2-yl}-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP(CF)2). It is expected that DPP(CF)2 would exhibit a molecular structure with better planarity than DPP(CT)2 because the oxygen atom in the furan ring is smaller than the sulfur atom in the thiophene ring. We demonstrate that this improved molecular structure decreases the steric hindrance and results in stronger π–π stacking, and the electronegative oxygen atom stabilizes the HOMO energy level. As a result, an improved photovoltaic performance can be expected. Herein, molecular geometries, crystallinities, charge-transporting abilities, and photovoltaic properties of DPP(CF)2 and DPP(CT)2 are investigated and compared, in order to verify the feasibility of the above molecular design strategy.


DPP(CF)2 was synthesized via traditional Pd(0)-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between ethyl-5-bromo-furan-2-carboxylate and the stannyl derivative of DPP, as shown in Scheme 1. The obtained DPP(CF)2, as well as DPP(CT)2, was soluble in either chloroform (more than 20 mg mL−1), chlorobenzene, or dichlorobenzene, due to the alkyl chain in the end heteroatom substitutions. The thermal properties of DPP(CF)2 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 1a) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 1b). The DSC heating trace for DPP(CF)2 shows a melting peak at 198 °C, suggesting that this molecule is crystalline. During the cooling process, a broad exothermic peak with a shoulder is observed from 75 to 130 °C, due to its quite slow crystallization process. From TGA curves, it is found that the decomposition temperature (Td) with 5% weight loss of DPP(CF)2 is 398 °C (39 °C higher than that of DPP(CT)2), indicating better thermal stability. This thermal stability is good enough for the application in optoelectronic devices.


Optical measurements provide essential information on the electronic properties and the ongoing electron-transfer process within materials. UV-vis absorption spectra of DPP(CF)2 and DPP(CT)2 in dilute chloroform (CF) solutions and corresponding thin films are compared in Fig. 2. Two molecules display similar characteristic absorption peaks due to similar molecular structures. However, the absorption of DPP(CF)2 red-shifts by ∼12 nm compared to that of DPP(CT)2 when they exist as monomeric dyes in solutions, implying a stronger conjugation effect between furan rings and the DPP core in DPP(CF)2. The red-shift of the absorption becomes more obvious in their solid films. Compared to the solutions, both films exhibit an additional absorption peak located in the longer wavelength region, which originates from strong intermolecular π–π overlapping in the condensed state. Because of the improved molecular arrangement due to better intramolecular conjugation and more planar molecular geometry, the absorption peak (representing π–π stacking) of the DPP(CF)2 film is more red-shifted and intense. As a result, the band-edge (λonset) of the DPP(CF)2 film extends to 773 nm, whereas that of DPP(CT)2 is 752 nm The optical band gaps (Eoptg) are calculated to be 1.60 eV and 1.65 eV for DPP(CF)2 and DPP(CT)2, respectively.


The electrochemical properties of DPP(CT)2 and DPP(CF)2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms of the two molecules in dichloromethane solutions. The CV curve was recorded versus the potential of a standard calomel electrode (SCE), which was calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). In the positive potential region, the E1/2 values for the first oxidation/reduction waves are calculated as the oxidation potential. From the empirical formula EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) eV, the HOMO energy level of DPP(CF)2 can be calculated to be −5.33 eV. Compared to DPP(CT)2, DPP(CF)2 also presents a slightly lower LUMO energy level of −3.58 eV, due to the increased electron affinity of the furan ring. The increased electron affinity of the furan ring can reduce both the HOMO and LUMO levels of DPP(CF)2 (induction effect). Moreover, the furan ring possesses a conjugation effect with the DPP core, leading to the increase of the HOMO level and the decrease of the LUMO level of DPP(CF)2 (conjugation effect). Therefore, the combination of the above two effects gives an identical HOMO level and a lower LUMO level of DPP(CF)2.


To demonstrate the improved π-conjugation and molecular planarity of DPP(CF)2 ensured by the end-groups of furan-2-yl-carboxylate, the molecular conformation and front orbitals of DPP(CF)2, in the free states, were simulated by theoretical calculations. The simulated front orbitals, energy levels, and dihedral angles between the end-groups and the DPP core are presented in Fig. 4 and Table 1. It is found that the dihedral angle between the DPP core and the end-group is merely 0.56° for DPP(CF)2, which is much smaller than that of DPP(CT)2 (5.27°). Due to this negligible steric distortion, the two furan moieties at end-groups can be considered to show complete coplanarity and excellent conjugation with the DPP core, giving a narrower Eg of 2.05 eV, whereas the Eg of DPP(CT)2 is 2.11 eV. Moreover, it is disclosed that the replacement of thiophene-2-carboxylate with furan-2-carboxylate induces a minor change in the HOMO energy levels of the two DPP molecules, from −5.35 to −5.33 eV, which is in accordance with the data from CV measurements.

Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated to reveal the enhanced charge-transporting properties of DPP(CF)2 due to the molecular planarity. For an average of 15 devices, the transfer curves of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 5. The as-cast films show an average hole mobility of 1.1 ± 0.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPP(CT)2 and 2.0 ± 0.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPP(CF)2, respectively. Through thermal annealing for 10 min at 100 °C, the hole mobility of DPP(CF)2 increases significantly by three orders of magnitude to 5.1 ± 2.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the hole mobility of DPP(CT)2 increases moderately to 3.1 ± 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing. The highest mobilities of the annealed DPP(CF)2 and DPP(CT)2 films are 1.3 × 10−2 and 6.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.


Photovoltaic properties of DPP(CT)2 and DPP(CF)2 were investigated by fabricating OSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DPP molecule:PC71BM/LiF/Al. J–V characteristics of the devices under one sun (simulated AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 6a, with the performance parameters summarized in Table 2. It is found that DPP(CF)2:PC71BM blends with weight ratios of either 2:1, 1:1, or 1:1.5 induce very poor device performances (PCE < 0.5%). The composition ratio of 1.5:1 results in a relatively better PCE of 0.52% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 1.47 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.37 and a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.96 V. This composition ratio is fixed for further device optimization by thermal annealing and incorporating additive. Thermal annealing leads to a decrease in VOC by 0.07–0.10 V. However, an increase in the FF by 0.05–0.15 and a remarkable improvement in JSC by several times are obtained. The devices exhibit the best PCE of 2.86% with a JSC of 6.23 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.89 V, and a FF of 0.52 after annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Incorporation of a 0.2% v/v additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) can only slightly increase the JSC and FF, leading to a PCE of 0.86%. Nevertheless, after combined with annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, the PCE of the device improves tremendously to 4.35%, with a JSC of 8.80 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.89 V, and a FF of 0.56. To further improve the photovoltaic performance of the DPP(CF)2-based OSCs, a Ca layer is used to replace the LiF layer, so that the cathode can collect electrons more efficiently. Thus, the PCE is elevated to 5.37%, with a much larger JSC of 11.40 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.89 V, and a FF of 0.53. This efficiency of 5.37% achieved by DPP(CF)2 is higher than those from most reported DPP-based small molecule donors (4.0–4.8%), and even higher than that from the polymer alternating DPP and furan rings (5.0%). Under the same device conditions, the PCE of the DPP(CT)2-based OSC is 3.89% due to a smaller JSC of 8.89 mA cm−2.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the DPP(CF)2-based OSCs are shown in Fig. 6b. All of the devices show a broad photovoltaic response ranging from 300 to 770 nm. The highest EQE value of the devices without any active layer treatment is only ∼10%. Thermal annealing improves the EQE in the whole spectrum, and the maximum value reaches 35% at 680 nm. Incorporation of additives slightly improves EQEs all over the response range, especially in the absorption range of DPP(CF)2 (500–700 nm). After combining these two treatments, a remarkable increase of EQE values covering the whole absorption range is observed, with the maximum EQE value of 58.9% at 629 nm.
To understand the underlying mechanism for the above improvements of the device performances, the effects of thermal annealing and additive on the morphology of the active layer were investigated. Fig. 7 shows the height and the corresponding phase images obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for DPP(CF)2:PC71BM blended films with different treatments. It is found that the film without treatment shows large domains on a scale of ∼100 nm and thermal annealing cannot alter the phase separation degree of the blended films. After 0.2% v/v DIO is added, the film becomes smoother and large domains disappeared. On further annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, phase separation with very clear boundaries is observed with a domain size of about 40 nm, and domains are much more interconnected. These interpenetrating networks of donors and acceptors not only provide interfaces for exciton dissociations but also percolation pathways for charge carrier transport to corresponding electrodes, responsible for the enhancement of the device performance.

Fig. 8 presents X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the active layers spin-coated on ITO substrates. As shown in Fig. 8a, the as-cast DPP(CF)2:PC71BM film exhibits a broad and weak peak at 2θ = 5.45°, indicating a low degree of crystallinity. This peak becomes much stronger by incorporating 0.2% v/v additive, indicating that DIO can promote the crystallization of DPP(CF)2. The annealed DPP(CF)2:PC71BM film shows a shifted sharp peak at 2θ = 7.25°, indicating higher crystallinity with different molecular arrangement from that in the as-cast film. While the blended film is treated by thermal annealing together with DIO, this sharp peak gets more pronounced, giving the highest crystallinity and ordered molecular packing. In Fig. 8b, it is shown that, under the conditions for best device performances, the obtained DPP(CT)2:PC71BM film exhibits a much weaker peak at 2θ = 6.45°, due to lower cystallinity induced by the less molecular coplanarity of DPP(CT)2.
We further investigated the effect of thermal annealing and additive on charge-transporting properties of the active layers by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. 9 and Table 3, films without annealing exhibit very low hole mobilities and relatively high electron mobilities, no matter they are incorporated with additive or not. The low hole mobilities and the unbalanced electron/hole transport are the main reasons for the poor performance of these two types of devices prepared without annealing. Thermal annealing can significantly enhance the hole mobilities in both types of devices. In addition, the electron mobilities are also improved slightly, and the more balanced electron/hole transport is obtained. Under the same conditions, both hole and electron mobilities of the DPP(CF)2:PC71BM film are much higher than those of DPP(CT)2:PC71BM. Therefore, based on the above analysis, we conclude: (1) the excellent photovoltaic properties of DPP(CF)2 are mainly ascribed to its superior charge-transporting ability. This is because the fully-planar molecular geometry of DPP(CF)2 is in favor of ordered molecular packing in the condensed state, especially after the treatment of thermal annealing; (2) additive improves the photovoltaic performance basically through the reduction of domain size in the active layer.

In summary, a DPP molecule end-capped with two furan-2-carboxylate moieties, DPP(CF)2, is successfully synthesized and demonstrated as a promising donor for solution-processable OSCs. The end-groups of furan-2-carboxylate endow DPP(CF)2 with a narrow Eg of 1.60 eV, a low-lying HOMO energy level of −5.33 eV, and a typically complete planar molecular geometry, which is favorable for ordered molecular packing in the condensed state. Incorporating furan-2-carboxylate can efficiently improve the molecular planarity and crystallinity, resulting in higher charge-transporting properties and photovoltaic performance. As a result, DPP(CF)2 exhibits excellent charge-transporting properties with the highest FET hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a high PCE of 5.37% after the optimization of thermal annealing and additive.


All reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. DPP(CT)2 was synthesized according to our previous published procedures.1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Advance DMX300 (300 MHz) and 600 (600 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscope. UV-visible absorption spectra were taken on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were conducted on a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a WCT-2 thermal balance under protection of nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 differential scanning calorimeter under protection of nitrogen at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was done on a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk, a Pt plate, and a standard calomel electrode (SCE) as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) CH2Cl2 solution. Topographic images of the films were obtained using Veeco Multi Mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode using an etched silicon cantilever at a nominal load of ∼2 nN, and the scanning rate for a 5 μm × 5 μm image size was 1.0 Hz. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bede D1 system high-solution X-ray diffractometer.


Geometry optimizations were carried out by the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Energies of front orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs) were evaluated with the basis set of 6-311+G(d,p). All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program. Model compounds of the two DPP derivatives were simplified by replacing pendant alkyl side chains with methyl groups to save computational time due to the fact that the geometries and energies negligibly depended on the pendant alkyl groups.


Furan-2-carboxylic acid (2.50 g, 22.3 mmol) and 50 mL of glacial acetic acid were poured into a 100 mL three-necked flask. Then, 1.32 mL (22.0 mmol) of bromine was added dropwise to the flask at room temperature. The mixture was warmed and stirred at 60 °C for 1 h. The mixture was poured into 50 mL of cold water and sodium sulfite was added to remove excess bromine. After that, the mixture was filtered, and a white solid was obtained. The crude product was recrystallized from 30 mL of ethanol–water (1:2) to give 3.14 g (yield 78%) of product 1 as white needles. 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO) δ 13.31 (s, 1H), 7.22 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 1H), 6.77 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 1H). 13C NMR (600 MHz, DMSO) δ 167.35, 145.19, 138.93, 127.33, 119.83.


1.2 g (6.51 mmol) compound 1 was soluble in 30 mL ethanol, and 1.24 mL trimethylchlorosilane was added into the solution under nitrogen. After being stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h, the mixture was heated at 65 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed by reduced pressure distillation. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel) with a dichloromethane and petroleum mixture (1:1, v/v) to yield a light yellow liquid 2 (1.48 g, yield 86%).1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.08 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 1H), 6.42 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 1H), 4.36 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H), 1.38 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 3H). 13C NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 157.80, 146.70, 127.46, 120.04, 114.05, 61.39, 14.47.


10 mL dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) was cooled to −10 °C under argon followed by addition of 3.19 mL n-butyllithium (1.6 M in hexane). Then a solution of 0.72 mL diisopropylamine was added slowly and the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min. Then, a freshly prepared solution of lithium diisopropylamine (LDA) in THF was added slowly to a cooled solution (−78 °C) of 3,6-bis(5-thiophene-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (1.07 g, 2.04 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at −78 °C under argon followed by addition of trimethyltin chloride (7.64 mL, 1 M in hexane). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. Water was added to the reaction mixture followed by extraction with ether. The combined organic phase was washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in a vacuum. Compound 3 was obtained as a sticky dark purple oil (1.68 g) with a yield of 97.5% and used without any further purification.


1.42 g (1.32 mmol) compound 3 and compound 2 (1.15 g, 3.31 mmol) were put into a two-neck 100 mL round flask and were purged three times with successive vacuum and nitrogen fill cycles. Then 30 mL of dry degassed toluene was added under the protection of nitrogen and the solution was flushed with nitrogen before the addition of 70 mg of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4). The reaction mixture was further degassed and subsequently sealed before being heated to 110 °C for 48 h. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator afforded the crude product, which was purified using column chromatography (silica gel) with a dichloromethane and petroleum mixture (5:1, v/v) to give a dark blue powder (0.48 g, yield 54%).1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.93 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 7.54 (d, J = 4.2 Hz, 2H), 7.24 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.75 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 4.39 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 4H), 4.12–3.97 (m, 4H), 1.88–1.97 (m, 2H), 1.40 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 6H), 1.40–1.27 (m, 16H), 0.90 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 6H), 0.86 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 161.41, 158.37, 151.45, 144.47, 139.56, 136.62, 136.28, 129.91, 124.59, 119.89, 117.42, 109.00, 61.19, 46.04, 39.23, 30.28, 28.44, 23.66, 23.05, 14.35, 14.03, 10.54.

A heavily doped silicon wafer was used as the gate electrode and the substrate, with a 300 nm thermal oxidation SiO2 layer as the gate insulator covered with divinyltetramethyldisiloxanebis(benzocyclobutene) (BCB). The DPP(CF)2 or DPP(CT)2 film was cast from chloroform (CF) solution and annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were constructed in a bottom-gated configuration by depositing top-contact source and drain electrodes (70 nm Au), with a channel length of 50 μm and a width of 1 mm. Transfer characteristics of the devices were measured in air using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The measured capacitance of the BCB-covered SiO2/Si substrates was 10 nF cm−2, and this value was used for mobility calculation.


Organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated on glass substrates commercially pre-coated with a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). Prior to fabrication, the substrates were cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, isopropanol consecutively for every 15 min, and then treated in an ultraviolet ozone generator for 15 min before being spin-coated with a layer of 35 nm poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). After baking the PEDOT:PSS in air at 140 °C for 15 min, the substrates were transferred to a glove box. A BHJ layer was spin-cast at 2500 rpm from a solution of DPP(CF)2 (or DPP(CT)2) and PC71BM in chloroform with or without 0.2% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) at a total solid concentration of 16 mg mL−1. The thickness of the active layers is 90–100 nm, which was calibrated using an Ambios XP-2 profilometer. Then the samples were loaded into a vacuum deposition chamber (background pressure ≈ 5 × 10−4 Pa) to deposit 0.6 nm thick LiF (or 20 nm thick calcium) and a 100 nm thick aluminum cathode with a shadow mask (device active area of 9 mm2).

The current density–voltage (J–V) curve was measured using Keithley 2400 measurement source units at room temperature in air. The photocurrent was measured under a calibrated solar simulator (Abet 300 W) at 100 mW cm−2, and the light intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon photovoltaic reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured using a Stanford lock-in amplifier 8300 unit.
The hole mobility of the blends was measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated in a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DPP(CF)2 (or DPP(CT)2):PC71BM/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm), electron-only devices were fabricated in a structure of Al(120 nm)/DPP(CF)2 (or DPP(CT)2):PC71BM/Al(100 nm). The device characteristics were extracted by modeling the dark current under forward bias using the SCLC expression described by the Mott-Gurney law:
Here,
εr ≈ 3 is the average dielectric constant of the blended film, ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, μ is the carrier mobility, L ≈ 70 nm is the thickness of the film, and V is the applied voltage.
