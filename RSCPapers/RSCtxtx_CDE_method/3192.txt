A graphene–Bi8La10O27 nanocomposite (GBL) was successfully synthesized by a facile microwave-assisted method, and applied as a counter electrode for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. This allowed the size and distribution of the Bi8La10O27 nanoparticles formed on a flexible graphene sheet to be effectively controlled, which is crucial for achieving high electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. GBL showed the highest catalytic activity and the lowest electrolyte diffusion resistance, mainly due to the homogeneous single-layer immobilization of Bi8La10O27 nanoparticles on a graphene sheet with high density. A dye-sensitized solar cell with GBL as a counter electrode can yield 7.09% photoelectric conversion efficiency, which is comparable to that of the cell with a Pt-film counter electrode (6.23), which demonstrates the application potential of GBL as a low cost non-Pt CE material for DSSCs.

Social progress and economic development are intensifying the human demand for energy. As a result, the three traditional types of nonrenewable fossil energy are increasingly exhausted, thus directly aggravating the energy problem, and highlighting it as an important concern that must urgently be addressed. In response to this issue, researchers have explored the availability of other types of energy, such as wind, water, geothermal, and solar. Among these energy types, solar energy is the best solution for the energy shortage in terms of cost, geographical distribution, and sustainability. Hence, the potential of solar cells has been investigated, particularly that of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

DSSCs have attracted considerable attention, due to their low fabrication cost and decent power conversion efficiency (PCE). A DSSC is a photoelectrochemical device that is composed of a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode anchored with a monolayer of dye molecules, an electrolyte containing redox species (e.g. I−/I3− redox couple), and a catalytic counter electrode. The working principle of a DSSC includes five major steps: (1) photon absorption by the dye molecules and the simultaneous excitation of electrons; (2) electron injection from the excited dye molecules into the TiO2 photoanode; (3) electron transport across the mesoporous TiO2 film to an external circuit; (4) dye regeneration by obtaining electrons from the redox species in the electrolyte; and (5) migration of redox species to the counter electrode, and the regeneration of the redox species on the catalytic counter electrode. Among them, the counter electrode collects electrons from the external circuit to catalyze the reduction of tri-iodide, which makes the whole circuit complete.
The counter electrode, which is considered an important component of the DSSC, has received increasing attention over the past few years. Usually, high electronic conductivity and superior electrocatalytic activity are the prerequisites to assess the excellence of a CE material. Customarily, the CEs of DSSCs are thermally decomposed platinum (Pt) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates, owing to its remarkable electrocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability. However, its relatively high cost and inferior resistance to corrosion in electrolytes have impeded large-scale manufacture. Many attempts have been made to use cheap materials like carbon, conductive polymers, and ceramics as alternative counter electrode materials for DSSCs. However, most of these materials were unable to replace platinum, as they usually achieved a relatively lower power conversion efficiency than the Pt containing devices. As a result, composite counter electrodes have attracted a lot of interest recently, in which some synergetic properties are expected.
Graphene (GR) has a two-dimensional (2D) structure that consists of single-layer carbon atoms, and is considered as the thinnest and toughest material. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, a 2D structure cannot stably exist at a centigrade temperature other than absolute zero. Single-layer GR could not be obtained until Geim and Novoselov successfully isolated it in 2004. GR is nearly transparent and of tight structure, giving rise to its high anti-permeability of gases. Even helium gaseous atoms cannot penetrate through. It exhibits a rather high specific surface area of 2.675 m2 g−1, and can be surface modified and easily dispersed in multifarious polymers and solvents, so it can be applied to fabricate nanocomposite materials. The electron mobility of GR is over 15000 cm2 V s−1, higher than that of carbon nanotubes or silicon-based transistors. Furthermore, it has an extremely low resistivity of only 10−6 Ω cm−1, much lower than that of copper or silver. Consequently, it can be said that GR is one of the materials with the highest conductivity, and can thereby be utilized to develop new-generation devices with thinner structures and faster conduction rates. Because of its superior physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, it is also suitable to be used in touch panels or solar cells.
Recently, Zhuoyin et al. exploited synthesized CuInS2 and reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites as counter electrodes via a facile two-step hydrothermal route, and observed a power conversion efficiency of 6.96%. Jie Ma et al. reported a composite film of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2)/graphene flakes characterized as the counter electrode (CE) for a Pt-free DSSC. It was found that enhanced electrocatalytic activity can be demonstrated when highly conductive graphene flakes were introduced into the MoS2 film.
Microwave techniques are advantageous over other synthesis techniques because less solvent and a clear reaction profile produce little waste. A short reaction time is needed which saves electricity and extra cooling reflux water. Another advantage of closed reaction vessels for short times is the prevention of toxic gases being released into the environment. Microwaves act as high frequency electric fields and will generally heat any material having movable electric charges, such as solid state conducting ions or polar molecules in a solvent. Polar solvents heated as their component molecules are forced to rotate with the field and lose energy in collisions.
Conductors and semiconductor materials produce heat when ions or electrons within them form an electric current, and energy is lost due to the electrical resistance of the material. These high frequency waves generate a localized hot spot with extremely high temperature and pressure and accelerate the nanoparticles, thereby causing simultaneous attachment to occur.
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that graphene-based Bi8La10O27 thin films show a high specific surface area, which is beneficial for the catalytic reaction, and for the solar power conversion efficiency. Bi8La10O27 with a suitable optical band gap energy of 0.75 eV has attracted much interest in both fundamental research and practical applications, due to its inherent advantages, such as excellent photo absorption with large absorption coefficient, environmental friendliness, high electron mobility, non-toxicity, and high quantum efficiency (>80%).
In view of the intrinsic catalytic activity of Bi8La10O27 and the good conductivity of graphene, the enhancement in catalytic capability of GBL is also imaginable. But studies on the photovoltaic application of GBL CEs have not yet been reported, so it is meaningful to shed light on the prospect of this composite in DSSCs. Considering the excellent catalytic activity of pristine graphene and Bi8La10O27, we proposed a nanocomposite of Bi8La10O27 immobilized onto graphene sheets. The immobilization of Bi8La10O27 onto graphene sheets could dramatically improve the catalytic activity, and therefore the photovoltaic performance, due to the synergetic catalysis of Bi8La10O27 and the graphene sheets. This demonstrates that the combination of ternary metal sulfides with graphene is a feasible approach to enhance the performance of DSSCs.

Bismuth(III) nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) as a Bi source for the preparation of graphene–Bi8La10O27 was purchased from Kanto Chemical Company, Japan, while lanthanum(III) nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were purchased from Daejung Chemicals & Metals Co., Ltd, South Korea. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were procured from Samchun Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd, South Korea, while methanol (CH3OH) was purchased from Merck, Germany. Ethyl cellulose 50 Cp was purchased from Dae Jung Chemicals & Metal Co., Ltd, Korea. All chemicals were used without further purification, and all experiments were performed using distilled water.


The Hummers' method was applied for the preparation of graphene oxide. In brief, 20 g of graphite and 460 mL of conc. H2SO4 were mixed in a beaker at 0 °C under vigorous stirring. Then, 60 g of KMnO4 was added to the suspension sample, while maintaining the temperature below 15 °C. After the addition of KMnO4, the increasing temperature was maintained below 35 °C, until the color of the mixture sample changed to brown. The obtained mixture was diluted with 750 mL of deionized (DI) water, then heated to a temperature just below 90 °C. After dilution, the mixture was heated to a temperature just below 100 °C, and vigorously stirred for 30 min. Then, 20% v/v of H2O2 was added to the mixture at 100 °C. The mixture was then washed with 10% HCl, H2O, and CH3COCH3, and the obtained solid was heat treated in a dry oven at 90 °C for 12 h, to obtain graphite oxide. To convert this to graphene oxide (GO), 300 mg of GP and 250 mL of DI water were mixed in a beaker container under vigorous stirring for 30 min. Next, the mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 h. To achieve the GO, the suspension mixture was filtered and washed several times with hot water, and kept in a dry oven for 12 h.


Polycrystalline Bi8La10O27 was made from a stoichiometric mixture of La2O3 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Bi2O3 (99.995%, Alfa-Aesar) by solid-state methods. Prior to weighing, the starting La2O3 oxide was fired at 900 °C to remove absorbed carbon oxide and water. The Bi2O3 oxide was then dried at 400 °C, and the mixture was calcined at 700 °C for 12 h. After grinding, the calcined powder was uniaxially pressed into pellets. The pellets were fired at 1000 °C for 24 h, which produced pellets with about a 60% theoretical density. Although firing the pellets at a higher temperature increased their density by about 5–10%, it resulted in partial decomposition.

For the synthesis of GBL, 0.2 g of GO was dispersed in 100 mL of DI water. After that, for further exfoliation of graphene oxide and to form a homogenous solution, mild ultrasonication was performed for 45 min. Then, 0.136 g of Bi8La10O27 was gradually dissolved in this GO solution with stirring at 80 °C for 1 h, to form a G-Bi8La10O27 (GBL) composite. The GBL nanocomposite solutions then underwent microwave irradiation treatment for 120 s at 450 W. The microwave-irradiated solutions were then transferred to 30 mL general purpose stainless steel and Teflon-lined autoclaves. The autoclaves were kept at 150 °C in a hot air oven for 24 h, and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The products were washed several times with DI water and ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The final product was then dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 90 °C to yield GBL.

To make CEs, each product (GBL1, GBL2, GBL3, GBL 4) was ground with the complementary suitable amount of ethanol and ethyl cellulose to form a paste. The paste was coated onto a clean F-doped tin oxide glass substrate by a traditional doctor-blade method to form a CE film, and the film thickness was controlled to be ca. 10 μm, using adhesive tape as a frame and spacer. The TiO2 photoanode film was fabricated by a similar process. In brief, commercial P25 powder (Degussa) was mixed with ethyl cellulose dissolved in ethanol and a small amount of α-terpineol under vigorous stirring to form a viscous slurry with a TiO2 content of 20 wt%. The paste was spread onto a clean FTO substrate with an exposed area of 0.25 cm2, and then subjected to calcination at 723 K for 30 min. The as-prepared TiO2 photoanode was sensitized by 0.5 mM N719 solution dissolved in ethanol for 24 h. The sandwiched DSSC was fabricated by clamping the dyed TiO2 photoanode with the above-mentioned CEs. An electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-propyl 1-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (Solaronix SA, Switzerland), 0.5 M LiI (Lancaster), 0.05 M I2 (Lancaster), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (NJ, USA) was injected into the cell by capillarity (Scheme 1).


X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadz XD-D1) was used to identify the crystallinity with monochromatic high intensity CuKa radiation (k = 1.5406 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-5600) was used to observe the surface state and structure of the prepared composite using an electron microscope. The element mapping over the desired region of the prepared composite was detected by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis attached to SEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM 2010, Japan) was used to observe the surface state and structure of the photocatalyst composites at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. TEM was also used to examine the size and distribution of the Bi8La10O27 particles deposited on the graphene sheet. Raman spectra of the sample were observed by spectrometry (Jasco Model Name NRS- 3100) with an excitation laser wavelength of 532.06 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on dummy cells with a typical symmetric sandwich-like structure, that is CE/electrolyte/CE using an impedance measurement unit of a workstation in the frequency range of 0–100 kHz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2410 digital source meter under AM 1.5 illumination (continuous solar simulator for PV cells, 100 mW cm−2), which was calibrated by a Si reference cell beforehand. All the measurements were executed at room temperature.



Fig. 1 shows the crystallographic structures of the as-synthesized samples of the graphene, and GBL catalysts, which were characterized by XRD techniques. According to the XRD pattern of graphene, the predominant peak at 2θ = 25.11° corresponds to the (002) plane of graphene, which is characteristic of graphene. The patterns in the XRD spectrum of Bi8La10O27, comprising peaks at the 2θ values of 28.67°, 30.31°, 29.1°, 30.4°, and 54.5°, correspond to the (001), (002), (101), (102), (110), (112), (113), (104), (211), (212), (220), and (310) planes. All the diffraction patterns of Bi8La10O27 matched those of the JCPDS data card No. 89-4388.

The surface morphology of the GBL was investigated by SEM and TEM (Fig. 2 and 3). Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of the as-prepared samples. Fig. 2(a) shows the morphology of Bi8La10O27, where the graphene surface has a flaky texture broken off in various directions, reflecting its layered structure. Fig. 2(b–d) show the micrographs of the nanocomposite of GBL, clearly illustrating the nano-flakes of graphene oxide. The large surface areas of the uniformly distributed GO nanosheets can also be observed. The TEM imagery in Fig. 4 suggests that the fine Bi8La10O27 particles are single-crystalline. The size of the Bi8La10O27 spheres was calculated to be around 10–15 nm. In this work, the graphene sheets are well distributed, and thus provide a large microsheet-type plate structure for Bi8La10O27 deposition, confirming the interactions between the graphene sheet and Bi8La10O27 nanospheres, which may give rise to excellent electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the spectrum shows strong peaks of Bi, and the presence of C, O, La, and Bi in the sample. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show that the graphene was successfully combined with Bi8La10O27. The weight percentages of C, O, Bi, La, and Si in the prepared GBL nanocomposite were 25.40, 21.16, 49.49, and 3.95 w%, respectively.

Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra that were acquired for the four samples of graphene and GBL to characterize their structures. It is expected that the harsh chemical oxidation process will result in predominant structural changes in the graphite lattice, due to the formation of different types of oxygenated functional groups at the basal plane, and also at the edge. Before the reactions occurred, the D band for GBL (1358 cm−1), associated with structural defects and disorder, shifted toward a slightly lower wavenumber for graphene (1350 cm−1). However, the shift of the G band, relative to the formation of new sp3 carbon atoms in the graphite, is from 1596 cm−1 GBL to a higher wavenumber of 1607 cm−1.
The chemical composition of the GBL composites was analyzed by XPS. Fig. 6(a) shows the XPS wide spectrum of the Bi8La10O27/graphene composites. The chemical binding energies located at 284.8, 837.8, and 530.6 eV are assigned to the characteristic peaks of C 1s, La 3d, and O 1s, respectively. The binding energies of La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2 were centered at 837.8 and 855.9 eV, respectively, which concurred with those of LaO (shown in Fig. 6(b)). The C 1s peaks at 162.5 eV were typically assigned to the C–O of graphene (shown in Fig. 6(c)). Moreover, the peak at 168.1 eV is the C 1s peak of Bi–C, which confirms that chemical bonds between graphene and GBL were firmly constructed. This can be ascribed to carbon substituting for oxygen atoms in the lattice of GBL, which resulted in the formation of GBL bonds.
To estimate the band gap energy of the as-synthesized catalysts, the diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were evaluated by Kubelka–Munk transformation of the measured reflectance, according to the following equation:
αhν = A(hν − Eg)1/2
where,
α, ν, Eg, and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy, and a constant, respectively. The estimated band gap energies of Bi8La10O27 and GBL from Fig. 7 were 2.75 and 2.00 eV, respectively. Incorporation of graphene into the Bi8La10O27 lattice has shifted the fundamental absorption edge of the GBL nanocomposite towards a longer wavelength, i.e. red shift, which can be attributed to electronic interactions between graphene and Bi8La10O27. As band gaps in semiconductor materials are closely related to the wavelength range absorbed, the band gap decreases with increasing absorption wavelength. Therefore, the band gap decreases with an increase in graphene concentration, which is analogous to the case of composite materials. Therefore, the introduction of graphene into Bi8La10O27 is able to effectively promote the visible light response of the DSSC. The increased absorption intensity of light for the GBL nanocomposite suggested that they could enhance photocatalytic activity.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms exhibit type IV curves with distinct H2-type hysteresis loops (Fig. 8), indicating the existence of abundant mesopores. The pore size (inset) shows a wide distribution range from 2 to 30 nm. Table 1 shows the BET surface area, pore volume, peak pore size, and average pore diameter of GBL. The samples were analyzed by determining that the BJH cumulative adsorption volume of the pores with diameters of 3.77 nm is 0.06 cm3 g−1 for GBL. Moreover, its specific surface area was 62.71 m2 g−1, with an average pore size of 33.4 Å, and a pore volume of 0.1709 cm3 g−1. Such a high surface area is favorable for sufficient contact between the electrode and the electrolyte, and the enhancement of electrochemical activities. Furthermore, I3− ions with diameters ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 nm can readily get access into pores, and therefore facilitate the charge transfer process for I3− reduction. It should be noted that in comparison to the I−/I3− redox couple, the Co-complex mediator is believed to be the most efficient redox couple for DSSCs, due to the encouraging open circuit voltage (∼1 V). However, the large size of the Co-complex significantly limits its mass transport, thus causing recombination loss. Meanwhile, a recent work reported that a doped graphene nanoplatelet electrocatalyst outperformed the conventional Pt in Co-mediated DSSCs. It is therefore expected that graphene with such a three-dimensionally interconnected mesoporous nanostructure can be applied in Bi8La10O27 DSSCs, with even higher photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 9 and Table 2 show the J–V curves of the DSSCs based on Bi8La10O27 and GBL1, GBL 2, GBL 3, and GBL 4, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The DSSC based on pure Bi8La10O27 CE offered a Jsc of 7.2 mA cm−2, and therefore a lower PCE of 1.86% was achieved, which mainly derives from the low open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.55 V, and low fill factor (FF) of 0.46. In comparison, the GBL CEs exhibit an enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc), due to the outstanding electronic properties of graphene. The Jsc of the DSSC based on the GBL2 CE was enhanced to 16.5 mA cm−2, and the FF also increased to 0.57, which resulted in a PCE of 7.09% that was comparable to that of the Pt electrode (6.23%) obtained by Chih's research group. In this study, the photovoltaic parameters of the Pt electrode show similar results to those of GBL1. The Jsc and Voc increase with greater amounts of graphene from 10 to 40 mg, which can be ascribed to high catalytic activity for I3− reduction and the efficient channels for electrolyte diffusion, thus producing more I− for dye regeneration, and more efficient light harvesting and electron injection. Meanwhile, the FF is also increased for the same reasons. When the amount of graphene increases to 40 mg, it produces a negative effect on the FF and Jsc of the DSSC. This result can be attributed to the lower catalytic activities and the higher Zw for electrolyte diffusion. Furthermore, the less photoelectrons generated by the TiO2 photoanode reduce its quasi-Fermi level, thus decreasing the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the photoanode and the chemical potential of the I3−/I− redox pair, viz. Voc of these two cells.

Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist impedance of symmetric cells fabricated with the TiO2 photoanode and Bi8La10O27 and GBL CEs, in order to elucidate the electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared DSSCs for the reduction of I3−. Generally, in these Nyquist plots of EIS, the CE-related impedance mainly includes intrinsic series resistance of the CE (Rs, located at high frequency of ∼100 kHz), charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface (Rct, intermediate frequency of 1–100 kHz), and Warburg diffusion impedance of the electrolyte (Zw, low frequency range of 0.1–10 Hz). Three typical semicircles are obvious, which are relevant to the porous structures of the materials. By increasing the concentration of Bi from 0.3 to 1 mM, the Rs also increased, which may originate from inferior adhesion between FTO glass and the printed paste film. It should be noted that the second semicircle of the GBL2 DSSC is much smaller than that of the other DSSCs. The redox reaction resistance (Rct) of the counter electrode affects the FF and PCE of cells in a negative way. The graphene sheets reduce the electron transporting resistance from the electrolyte to both the counter electrode materials and substrate. This indicates that the Rct of the DSSC becomes smaller with the incorporation of graphene, which further confirms the excellent conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of the GBL CE with an optimum coated amount of Bi8La10O27.



Fig. 11 shows the variation in the real part of the impedance (Z′) as a function of frequency. It has been observed that Z′ decreases with an increase in frequency for all the nanocomposites (0.5%–2.0% GBL). This is due to an increase in conductivity with frequency, resulting from the hopping phenomenon. It can be observed that in the low frequency region, strong frequency dependence is obtained, as the low frequency region corresponds to high resistivity, due to the effectiveness of resistive grain boundaries in this region. Whereas, in the high frequency region, the sample shows frequency-independent behavior. Moreover, Z′ decreases with a corresponding increase of graphene in percentage.


Fig. 12 shows the variation in the reactive part of the impedance (Z′′) as a function of frequency and composition, which reveals the same trend as that of Z′. The Z′′ decreases with the increase in concentration, due to the decrease in grain boundary capacitance C, which may be explained by the following relation:
Z′′ = 1/jωc
Thus, as the graphene concentration increases, the value of
C increases, which in turn leads to a decrease in Z′′.


The total conductivity is the sum of ac conductivity and dc conductivity, which is given by
σ = σdc + σac
The dc conductivity is independent of frequency, and ac conductivity shows frequency-dependent behavior, which may be due to the electron hopping between the carbon atoms of graphene and Tiþ4 ions, and is calculated using the following relation, as shown in
Fig. 13:
σac = ε′εoωtanδ
where
ω is the angular frequency and εo is the permittivity of free space. It has been observed that ac conductivity gradually increases with the increase in frequency of the applied ac field, because the increase in frequency enhances the electron hopping frequency.


Fig. 13 shows that the ac conductivity of all GBL nanocomposites was increased with an increase in frequency, as well as graphene concentration. In addition, the electrocatalytic properties of these various CE materials are summarized in Table 3.

Fig. 14 shows the energy level diagram and mechanism of the generation of the photocurrent in TiO2 DSSCs with a graphene layer. The work function of a graphene layer is approximately 4.5 eV. Graphene has a work function between that of the FTO (4.8 eV) and the TiO2 photoelectrode. Electrons that were excited from the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) in dye N719 were injected into the FTO film via the TiO2 photoelectrode and the graphene electron transport layer. Then, the electrons generated a photocurrent. Therefore, in this study, the improvement in power conversion efficiency is attributed to electron transport.

In summary, graphene–Bi8La10O27 nanocomposites for DSSC electrodes were synthesized by introducing GO into the formation system toward nanoscale Bi8La10O27via a microwave-assisted method. The composite accommodates high electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction and efficient channels for electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion, which enhance the photovoltaic performance. The TEM imagery shows that nanoscale Bi8La10O27 with a size of 15 nm was attached onto a graphene sheet. Raman spectra show the high value of graphitic crystals present in the graphene–Bi8La10O27 nanocomposites. On the basis of J–V and EIS analysis, the introduction of graphene with Bi8La10O27 nanoparticles did indeed better enhance the electrocatalytic activity for reduction compared to the pure Bi8La10O27-based DSSC. The PCE for the GBL2 CE with 60 mg of graphene reaches 7.09%, which is comparable to that of Pt CE (6.23%), and significantly higher than that of the pristine Bi8La10O27 CE (1.86%). These data suggest that the GBL2 CE is an optional and efficient alternative to Pt electrodes for DSSCs.
