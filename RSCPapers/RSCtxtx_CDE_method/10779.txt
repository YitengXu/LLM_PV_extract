The efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells are strongly impacted by the charge extraction materials. Considering the high density of surface defects at the perovskite/charge transporting interfaces, passivation strategies should be optimized to reduce trap states at the surface of the perovskite. Herein, we investigate the concept of the interfacial layer (IL) at the perovskite/hole transport material (HTM) interface as well as the IL/HTM compatibility. A polymer IL based on poly-N-vinyl (3,6-DMPA-carbazole) (PV(Cz-DMPA)) has been used to engineer the perovskite/HTM interface in conventional perovskite solar cells. The non-conjugated PV(Cz-DMPA) polymer exhibiting suitable energy levels and high hole mobility serves as a functional IL material. Moreover, the IL also shows an efficient passivation effect. It results in lower trap state density, thus reducing interfacial charge recombination pathways. Then, two chemically compatible carbazole-based HTMs, namely Cz-P and Cz-Pyr, containing similar carbazole-based structures have been selected to strengthen IL/HTM interactions. Expectedly, a beneficial IL/HTM compatibility has been evidenced. As a result, the FF values of devices have been significantly improved (>80%), leading to high PCE (>22%) for devices fabricated with PV(Cz-DMPA)/Cz-Pyr as polymer IL/HTM materials, outperforming devices made from PV(Cz-DMPA)/spiro-OMeTAD.

Owing to outstanding opto-electronic properties enabling tunable light-absorption, low exciton binding energy, long charge carrier diffusion length and balanced ambipolar transport, 3D organometal halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention in the field of photovoltaics. The efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has dramatically increased in less than a decade since the first report of a solution-processed solid state PSC, with maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) now reaching 25.5%. Among the components of the PSC, charge extracting materials, which play a critical role in the selective extraction of electrons and holes at the interfaces, are known to strongly impact device efficiency and stability. Huge efforts have been made to replace the costly standard 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) that is used in most efficient PSCs. Moreover, considering the low trap state density in the bulk and high density of surface defects at the perovskite/charge transporting layer interfaces, non-radiative recombination phenomena mostly occur at the perovskite/charge transporting layer interfaces. Hence, those interfacial phenomena, along with energy level alignment and charge transport properties of the HTM, require the consideration of passivation strategies to reduce trap states at the surface of the perovskite.

An additional interfacial layer (IL) at the perovskite/HTM interface is a plausible solution for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells, due to the merits of (i) passivation of surface trap states of the perovskite, (ii) facilizing charge extraction from the perovskite to the HTM, and (iii) preventing interfacial recombination. Decoupling hole extraction and hole transport steps would allow a specific and therefore more appropriate design for each function. So far, thin organic ILs have been successfully integrated in PSCs using a few π-conjugated polymers such as poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT), polytriphenylamine derivatives or donor–acceptor (D–A)-type copolymers, where the improvement in device efficiency could be mainly ascribed to efficient hole extraction due to suitable energy levels and high mobility of the IL polymer films. Passivation of specific sites on the perovskite surface is addressed more easily with small organic molecules than with conjugated polymers, upon the facilitated introduction of a wide variety of available functional groups. Surface defects on metal halide perovskites can be passivated by capping ligands through coordinate or ionic bonding. In particular, molecular surface modifiers acting as Lewis bases or acids have been proposed to target undercoordinated Pb2+ and I− sites, respectively. This surface passivation approach demonstrated reduced non-radiative recombination losses and afforded remarkable device PCE increase, mostly related to improved open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). Following these reports, Park et al. introduced the tetracyano-functionalized F4TCNQ as a thin molecular IL in a PSC with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. Recently, based on spiro-OMeTAD HTM, PSCs with quinacridone, or fluorinated 3,6-bis(4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylaminyl)-carbazole (Cz-DMPA) molecular ILs exhibited significant PCE and stability enhancement, with noticeably high FF values (up to 80%) achieved in both cases.
However, a polymer layer would be mechanically more robust than a molecular one. Although the chemical compatibility has already been used in OPV applications, showing reduced interfacial tension, it is worth noticing that little attention has been paid so far to the IL/HTM chemical compatibility in PSCs, since spiro-OMeTAD was typically used as HTM in IL-related studies. Yet, previous reports on molecular modifiers suggest that a strong interaction with the HTM is highly desirable. Although non-conjugated polymers enable chemical engineering on the pendant groups, this strategy has not been applied to design IL materials so far. While Su et al. reported PSCs incorporating poly-N-vinylcarbazole (PVK) as a protective hydrophobic IL, this conventional polymer did not aim at passivating trap states.
In this work, a functionalized non-conjugated poly-N-vinyl(carbazole-DMPA) polymer (PV(Cz-DMPA)) was selected as the IL material and used in PSCs in combination with two carbazole-based HTMs having a similar chemical structure, namely Cz-P and Cz-Pyr (depicted in Chart 1). The choice of PV(Cz-DMPA), previously reported as a HTM, was guided by its suitable HOMO energy level (−5.24 eV vs vacuum) and high hole mobility due to the presence of the π-conjugated Cz-DMPA pendant groups. Importantly, the methoxy functions on the DMPA units are known to passivate undercoordinated Pb2+ and metal Pb0 sites via Lewis acid/base interactions due to the presence of lone electron pairs on the oxygen atoms. This is expected to be a key merit for a functional IL material since exposed Pb2+ defect sites are understood to play a critical role at the surface of metal halide perovskites. Finally, strong interactions between selected IL materials and HTMs occur due to chemical compatibility, thereby contributing to hole extraction. Also, carbazole-based molecules are currently among the most promising HTMs, and the selected Cz-P and Cz-Pyr HTMs exhibit performances competing and outperforming spiro-OMeTAD.
In order to investigate the outstanding performance of the IL, planar organic–inorganic lead halide PSCs with the n–i–p architecture were built w/o a polymer IL, as well as reference devices with the standard spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report on a dual-function IL material designed to both passivate trap states and exhibit strong compatibility with the HTM layer. The present results not only evidence the passivating effect of the polymer IL, but also benefit IL/HTM compatibility. The performance of perovskite solar cells has enhanced remarkably after combining an IL/HTM, with the best PCE of 22.26% and also a good stability of ∼94.8% of the initial efficiency after 400 h aging.

The poly-N-vinyl(3,6-DMPA-carbazole) polymer PV(Cz-DMPA) was synthesized in three steps, following a modified procedure, as depicted in Scheme 1. The nucleophilic substitution of the commercially available N3, N3, N6, N6-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9-H-carbazole-3,6-diamine (1) with 1,2-dichloroethane, followed by an elimination reaction of the N-alkylated compound 2 with KOH, afforded the functionalized vinyl monomer 3 in fair yield. The polymer was then obtained via a free-radical polymerization of 3 using 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator in anhydrous THF, as adapted from a previously reported procedure. The chemical structures of monomers and PV(Cz-DMPA) were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PV(Cz-DMPA), as determined by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), were approximately 2 × 104 and 2.12, respectively. The syntheses of Cz-Pyr and Cz-P have already been reported elsewhere.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of PV(Cz-DMPA) (−5.24 eV) lies in-between the perovskite (−5.46 eV) and all three considered HTMs Cz-Pyr (−5.18 eV),Cz-P (−5.12 eV) and spiro-OMeTAD (−5.20 eV) energy levels. Thus, PV(Cz-DMPA) appears to be suitable for use as an IL at the perovskite/HTM interface, since this cascade energy levels alignment should allow efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM layer. Together, its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level is sufficiently high to prevent electron transfer from the perovskite to the HTM.
In order to investigate the effect of polymer IL on the photovoltaic properties, planar n–i–p type PSCs were built based on the device structure of fluorine doped tin oxide FTO/SnO2/Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3/HTM/Ag as reference devices. The best PCE, open circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the devices, using spiro-OMeTAD, Cz-Pyr and Cz-P as HTMs, are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI). PSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD, Cz-Pyr and Cz-P HTMs obtained respectively PCEs of 20.25%, 19.27% and 18.75%. As previously described in the literature, Cz-P and Cz-Pyr show similar PCEs compared to spiro-OMeTAD with VOC above 1 V. In these devices, JSC and FF are similar too, showing JSC around 25.2 mA cm−2 and FF of 72.7 to 73.8%.
Planar n–i–p PSCs were also fabricated using the polymer interlayer as FTO/SnO2/Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3/IL/HTM/Ag The cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the complete device can be clearly seen in Fig. 1b. The thickness of SnO2, perovskite film and IL/HTM are respectively around 27 nm, 516 nm and 133 nm. The introduction of the carbazole polymer derivative IL has a strong impact on the PV parameters. The best as well as the average PV parameters (out of 20 independent cells under the same conditions) are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the introduction of the IL improved the fill factor. Indeed, after introduction of the IL, FF of the whole devices increase from 73% to 77–80%. As illustrated from the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing devices in Fig. 1c, higher VOC can be observed too, leading to the improvement of the PCEs as 21.13%, 22.26% and 21.63%, respectively to devices with IL/spiro-OMeTAD, IL/Cz-Pyr and IL/Cz-P (Fig. 1f). Therefore, the insertion of polymer IL has led to improved device performances, especially for the ones fabricated with Cz-Pyr and Cz-P as HTMs. It can be noticed at that point that Cz-Pyr and Cz-P are HTMs should present a stronger chemical compatibility with the polymer IL, assuming a better intermolecular packing. Fig. S3 (ESI) displays the water contact angle results for Cz-P, Cz-Pyr, PV(Cz-DMPA) films on glass substrates. The IL surface shows an angle of 74° whereas the HTMs, Cz-P and Cz-Pyr, show respectively angles of 83° and 80°. The surface hydrophobicity between IL and HTMs is relatively similar, an indication of better compatibility. It can be observed that the value of the angle for Cz-Pyr expects a better compatibility with the IL polymer.

Fig. 1d shows the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) measured on devices with IL/Cz-Pyr, IL/Cz-P and IL/spiro-OMeTAD as the reference. The cells using IL/Cz-Pyr and IL/Cz-P showed higher EQEs compared to the reference device. The integrated JSC were calculated to 22.62, 22.41 and 21.60 mA cm−2, respectively for Cz-Pyr, Cz-P and spiro-OMeTAD. The efficiency of the devices with carbazole derivatives as HTMs is improved in the range of 350–800 nm compared to the reference spiro-OMeTAD, which is consistent with the improvement of the JSC. To further confirm this trend, the steady-state current density and PCE output of the different devices were measured at the maximum output point (0.87 V, 0.93 V, and 0.92 V respectively for IL/spiro-OMeTAD, IL/Cz-Pyr, and IL/Cz-P devices). From Fig. 1e, the steady-state current density outputs were 21.82 mA cm−2, 22.07 mA cm−2, and 22.01 mA cm−2 for PSCs based on IL/spiro-OMeTAD, IL/Cz-Pyr and IL/Cz-P, and the stabilized PCEs were calculated to be 18.98%, 20.44%, and 20.26%, accordingly, which is in agreement with the results of J–V tests and EQE. Meanwhile, the carbazole HTM based devices exhibit a more stable behavior, while the reference device shows a certain degree of decline. These results show that the steady-state output performance and stability of the carbazole HTM based devices are superior to the spiro-OMeTAD reference device.
The morphologies of the IL modified perovskite films were characterized via SEM (Fig. 2). The pure perovskite film exhibits uniform crystallization (crystal size of around 400 nm). In more detail (Fig. S4, ESI), there are clear crystal grain boundaries and few pinholes which may lead to recombination losses as well as moisture penetration into the devices. Such a morphology is a main drawback the fabrication of efficient and stable devices. The deposited IL formed a thin and full coverage at the top of the perovskite layer (Fig. 2a), which favors the further deposition of continuous and flat HTM films, as observed in Fig. 2b–d.
The charge recombination and extraction process of the films based on the device structure of FTO/perovskite and FTO/perovskite/IL/HTM was studied by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL and TRPL). Fig. 3a shows a PL peak at the wavelength of 798 nm ascribed to the perovskite film, which was quenched by depositing a HTM due to the excited hole transfer from perovskite to the HTM layer. Then the PL intensity was further decreased by the introduction of IL. It is noteworthy that perovskite/IL/Cz-Pyr (Cz-P) configurations show a stronger quenching effect than perovskite/IL/spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting a more efficient charge extraction at the perovskite/IL/Cz-Pyr interface.
The corresponding TRPL decay curves, in Fig. 3b, were fitted by a bi-exponential decay function f(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where τ1 is related to the non-radiative recombination caused by defects and τ2 is related to the radiation recombination. The average lifetime value τaverage of the FTO/perovskite is 201.74 ns. After adding the IL/HTM layers, these values decrease to 79.83 ns for IL/spiro-OMeTAD and even more for the carbazole derivatives (45.67 ns for IL/Cz-Pyr; 68.63 ns for IL/Cz-P). The shorter lifetime when introducing the carbazole based HTMs shows the efficient charge extraction and transportation between the perovskite and the IL/Cz-Pyr (IL/Cz-P) layers, which can be explained by the defect passivation by the IL. Both PL and TRPL studies are consistent and illustrate that the carbazole based polymer IL can effectively inhibit the interface-related recombination. Moreover, this effect is comparatively prominent in the combination of IL/Cz-Pyr or Cz-P, which is highly relevant to their chemical compatibility.
Subsequently, the interfacial charge dynamics was examined by electrochemical impedance (EIS) under illumination with a light intensity of 20 mW cm−2. Fitted by an equivalent circuit, the Nyquist curves (Fig. 3c) showed two arcs, produced by the parallel combination of resistance and capacitance while at high frequency and low frequency, the arc is reported corresponding to the transfer resistance (Rtr) and recombination resistance (Rrec) respectively. The Rtr was determined to be 2757 Ω, 2132 Ω, and 1953 Ω for PSCs with IL/spiro-OMeTAD, IL/Cz-Pyr and IL/Cz-P. In contrast, the opposite trend was observed for Rrec, indicating an improved charge transfer process as well as a suppressed carrier recombination.
Furthermore, the relationship between VOC of the device and the logarithmic attenuation of the light intensity is depicted in Fig. 3d. It was linearly fitted according to the formula VOC = nkTln(P)/q + C, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, q is the charge, C is a constant, and n is the ideal factor representing the recombination caused by defects. The ideal factors n are determined to be 1.78, 1.16 and 1.17 for devices based on IL/spiro-OMeTAD, IL/Cz-Pyr and IL/Cz-P. A smaller n value indicates that the defect-assisted recombination or interface recombination loss is effectively suppressed. The results are consistent with EIS which further confirms that recombination losses at the interfaces are suppressed and that the compatibility between IL and HTM enhances this phenomenon.
In the meanwhile, the hole-trap density was measured by space charge limited current (SCLC) method on the hole-only devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/IL/HTM/Ag. In Fig. 3e, the onset voltage (VTFL) of the trap-filled limit region is reported to be linearly proportional to the trap density (ntrap), which is determined to be 1.03 V, 0.89 V and 0.96 V for devices with IL/spiro-OMeTAD, IL/Cz-Pyr and IL/Cz-P composite layer. Accordingly, the hole-trap density was calculated to be 0.97 × 1016 cm−3, 0.84 × 1016 cm−3 and 0.90 × 1016 cm−3, much lower than the device based on spiro-OMeTAD (without IL) which gave the trap density of 1.22 × 1016 cm−3 (Fig. S5, ESI). Therefore, the hole defect density is significantly reduced by introducing the polymer IL layer, then decreased even further by replacing spiro-OMeTAD by Cz-Pyr and Cz-P HTMs. The trap states are strongly reduced by using carbazole based IL/HTM, which is one reason for the enhancement of the device performance.
In addition to the cell efficiency, stability is a fatal limitation factor for commercialization of PSCs. Indeed, the degradation of the perovskite materials is caused by internal and external conditions, including the perovskite film, ionic migration, ambient humidity and oxygen stress. Here, both polymer interlayer and hydrophobic carbazole based HTMs can be used as protective layers. The stability of the unencapsulated PSCs FTO/SnO2/Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag and FTO/SnO2/Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3/IL/HTM/Ag (where HTM is spiro-OMeTAD, Cz-Pyr or Cz-P) were estimated by exposing the device to a relative humidity (of around 35%) in the atmosphere.Fig. 3f shows the normalized PCE of the devices based on IL/spiro-OMeTAD, IL/Cz-Pyr and IL/Cz-P (values calculated out of 3 devices for each IL/HTMs composition) for an exposure time of 400 hours. In contrast to the stability of the spiro-OMeTAD based device (without IL), shown in Fig. S6 (ESI), PSCs allowing an additional IL performed better. Devices with IL show a relatively constant efficiency with a loss of less than 10% after 400 h. This relative stability could be due to the additional carbazole based polymer interfacial layer. By comparing devices with spiro-OMeTAD versusCz-Pyr or Cz-P as HTMs, we can certainly claim that the stabilities of the devices are increased when using carbazole based HTMs (maintained PCE at ∼93.8% and ∼94.3%) instead of spiro-OMeTAD (∼90.5%). Hence, we can assume that the introduction of Cz-Pyr and Cz-P as HTMs when using poly-N-vinyl(3,6-DMPA-carbazole) polymer as the interfacial layer leads to a better stability of PSCs.

In summary, perovskite solar cells have been fabricated using a carbazole based polymer as the interfacial layer between the perovskite layer and the hole transporting layer. This study is a proof of concept that chemical compatibility of IL and HTM is beneficial to reach better performances and outperform the reference spiro-OMeTAD. First, we demonstrate, as in the literature, that the introduction of a polymer IL, like PV(Cz-DMPA), has a beneficial effect on the photovoltaic parameters. Moreover, we fully investigate and demonstrate that the utilization of a polymer IL in association with a chemically compatible HTM allows the increase of the FF, leading to an improved power conversion efficiency. Indeed, the combination of carbazole based polymers PV(Cz-DMPA) and Cz-Pyr or Cz-P, improves the FF to over 80%. PL and TRPL studies showed a more efficient charge extraction and an inhibition of interface recombination when IL/HTM have a similar chemical structure. These conclusions are confirmed by EIS and SCLC, showing an improved charge transfer process and a trap passivation effect. Overall, the chemical compatibility between the IL and the HTM leads to an improvement of the cell efficiencies allowing to outperform the efficiency of the standard HTM spiro-OMeTAD. Both promising carbazole based HTM show better performance compared to spiro-OMeTAD, Cz-Pyr HTM confirms its potential with a PCE of 22.26% (spiro-OMeTAD 21.13%), more than 1% over the reference. Finally, unencapsulated devices using both Cz-Pyr or Cz-P as HTM show an improved stability over 400 hours under 35% humidity (over 94%) demonstrating the long-term relevance of the use of a polymer interfacial layer.

3,6-Bis[N,N′-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9-(2-chloroethyl)-carbazole (2) (1.1 g, 1.6 mmol), KOH (0.36 g, 6.4 mmol), and hydroquinone (0.0088 g, 0.08 mmol) were dissolved in toluene/isopropanol (7:3) under an Ar atmosphere. The solution was stirred at 95 °C for 48 h, and isopropanol was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted with ethyl acetate, the organic phase was washed with distilled water (3 × 60 mL), brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel neutralized with triethylamine, using cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (8:2) as the eluent to afford 3 as a yellow powder. Yield 0.70 g (65%). 1H NMR (Acetone-D6, 300 MHz): δ 7.69 (d, J = 8.9 Hz, 2H), 7.60 (d, J = 2.1 Hz, 2H), 7.48 (dd, J = 15.9, 9.4 Hz, 1H), 7.16 (dd, J = 8.9, 2.3 Hz, 2H), 6.95 (d, J = 9.1, 8H), 6.82 (d, J = 9.1 Hz, 8H), 5.51 (dd, J = 15.9, 0.9 Hz, 1H), 5.05 (dd, J = 9.4, 0.8 Hz, 1H), 3.74 (s, 12H); 13C NMR (Acetone-D6, 75 MHz): δ 156.21, 143.71, 143.18, 136.67, 130.61, 125.77, 125.62, 124.60, 116.14, 115.50, 112.47, 100.17, 55.72.


3,6-Bis[N,N′-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9-vinyl-carbazole (3) (0.65 g, 0.001 mol) and recrystallized AIBN (1.65 mg, 0.01 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous THF (3 mL) under an Ar atmosphere. The solution was stirred at 70 °C for 48 h in the absence of light. The viscous reaction mixture was precipitated in methanol (200 mL). The obtained powder was purified by repeated reprecipitation in methanol (4 × 200 mL). Then, Soxhlet extraction was done with methanol, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, and finally toluene. The toluene fraction was evaporated under reduced pressure, reprecipitated in methanol, filtered and dried under vacuum. The polymer was obtained as a yellow powder. Yield 0.45 g (69%). Mn = 19745, Mw = 41768, PDI = 2.12.
