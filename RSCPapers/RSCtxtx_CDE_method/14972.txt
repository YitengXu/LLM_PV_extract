Over the past decade, two typical device architectures of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been developed as n–i–p regular devices (r-PSCs) and p–i–n inverted cells (i-PSCs). Hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play a vital role in facilitating hole extraction and transport in PSCs. However, a large number of reported HTMs are only applicable for either r-PSCs or i-PSCs owing to the quite different design strategies of the corresponding HTMs. Herein, a spiro-structured configuration was employed to construct lower symmetry molecules. Planar electron-rich carbazole and twisted triphenylamine units as electron donors were incorporated into the spiro-core and denoted as spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA, respectively. The decreased symmetrical conformation contributes to high glass transition temperatures and supports thermally stable amorphous HTM films. Compared with spiro-TPA, spiro-CZ featuring carbazole donors realized more effective capability of hole extraction. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.52% was achieved by n–i–p structured PSCs with spiro-CZ, significantly exceeding that of the reference spiro-TPA (8.47%). However, contrary to expectations, p–i–n structured PSCs with undoped spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA obtained a comparable PCE of 16.06% and 15.79%, respectively. Note that these PCEs were shown to outperform that of commercial dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD (10.48%) and PEDOT:PSS (13.74%) under the same conditions. Moreover, the doped spiro-CZ-based r-PSCs delivered a good long-term device stability under ambient conditions. Overall, seeking lower symmetry molecules endowed with planar electron-rich units is a promising method to support the development of efficient universal HTMs toward i-PSCs and r-PSCs.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising renewable photovoltaic technology by virtue of their simultaneously optimized efficiency and device stability. Two types of PSCs were explored with an n–i–p regular structure (r-PSCs) and p–i–n inverted architecture (i-PSCs). r-PSCs were devised with a typical structure of ITO/electron-transporting layers (ETLs)/perovskite/hole-transporting layers (HTLs)/metal electrode. Within this type of r-PSC, inorganic materials (e.g., TiO2 and SnO2) were adopted to prepare ETLs. The r-PSCs exhibited excellent device stability, which is beneficial for large-scale production. By contrast, i-PSCs were explored as a common architecture of ITO/HTMs/perovskite/ETMs/metal electrode. Here, organic materials were used as HTLs and ETLs ensuring a low-temperature solution-process. Therefore, this type of i-PSC indicates more promising applications in laminated silicon–perovskite and flexible photovoltaic devices. In the mentioned two types of architectures, hole-transporting materials (HTMs) were structured as sandwiched layers in direct contact with perovskites and electrodes, which play a vital role in facilitating hole extraction and transport. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop facile-effective HTMs. Compared with inorganic HTMs, organic HTMs have advantages of easy synthesis and purification, high hole-mobility and various structural patterns.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) are the most commonly reported commercial organic HTMs toward i-PSCs and r-PSCs, respectively. It should be noted that, over the past few years, a large number of effective HTMs reported have been available only for either r-PSCs or i-PSCs (e.g., commercial PEDOT:PSS shows satisfactory photovoltaic properties in i-PSCs, while it cannot be utilized to fabricate r-PSCs because its aqueous solution could degrade the upper layer perovskite materials; in addition, the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD exhibits an outstanding performance in r-PSCs, while a low efficiency is observed in i-PSCs). If a single hole-transporting material could serve both the aforementioned r-PSCs and i-PSCs, the photovoltaic research will be more effective.
However, this goal is very challenging owing to the quite different design strategies of HTMs toward i-PSCs and r-PSCs. In n–i–p structured r-PSCs, the hole mobility and conductivity of HTMs will significantly affect the power conversion efficiency (PCE). In order to facilitate charge-transporting ability, an extended planar π-conjugated backbone was preferred as it favors the formation of ordered intermolecular π–π packing (crystallization). Nevertheless, the aforementioned factor may result in an inferior film-formation of HTMs, which is unacceptable for p–i–n structured i-PSCs. Since the perovskite layers are spin-coated on the top of the HTM film, the film morphology of HTMs evidently affects perovskite crystallization, and further affects the device efficiency and stability. Therefore through molecular design to balance the film morphology and charge mobility, an efficient multirole HTM would be explored and applied to r-PSCs and i-PSCs successfully. Nowadays, only a very few HTMs reported can achieve efficient performance in regular n–i–p and inverted p–i–n PVSCs.
According to reports, an orthogonal spiro-core can make for lower symmetry molecules. This conformation confers a high glass transition temperature (Tg) favourable for a highly uniform organic thin film. However, these symmetric structural HTMs suffer from the drawbacks of low hole mobility derived from weak intermolecular electronic coupling. Therefore, it is necessary to make up for the weakened hole mobility via an effective molecular design strategy. Studies have revealed that the incorporation of planar electron-rich units is beneficial for hole extraction and transportation. Thus, seeking lower symmetry molecules endowed with electron-rich ability is a promising method for achieving efficient all-round HTMs.
Inspired by the above studies, in this work, an orthogonal molecular conformation with central spiro-carbon was employed to construct lower symmetry molecules. Planar carbazole units as electron-rich fused heterocycles were assembled with the spiro-core and denoted as spiro-CZ. Triphenylamine moieties as electron donors were also introduced into the molecule as a reference HTM and denoted as spiro-TPA. Commercialized HTMs spiro-OMeTAD and PEDOT:PSS were used as controls to evaluate the advantages of the two new HTMs. The optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance of these HTMs were investigated. Spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA show similar optoelectronic properties, but the photovoltaic performance of HTMs in different structured PSCs is distinct. Density functional theory calculations, scanning electron microscopy, steady-state PL characterization. etc. were also performed to support these results.

Sun reported a fluorene-based molecule HT2 with a two-step reaction. In our work, a new kind of N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine electron donor was incorporated into our molecules. And a new synthetic route of fluorene-based HTMs was introduced as presented in Fig. 1a and Scheme S1, involving only an electrophilic substitution and a Buchwald reaction. The corresponding NMR spectra are presented in Fig. S5–S7. In both the designed HTMs, fluorene-based units play two roles as donors and backbones. Starting from 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone, the cost for spiro-CZ is $26.3 g−1, which is much cheaper than commercial spiro-OMeTAD ($91 g−1) (Tables S1 and S2).


To gain insight into the energy levels of HTMs, the optical characteristics and electrochemical properties of spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA were measured. As shown in Fig. 2a, spiro-CZ exhibits a slight red-shift of 3 nm in comparison with spiro-TPA. Accordingly, the photoluminescence spectrum of spiro-CZ shows a similar red-shift. The optical band gap of HTMs was calculated to be 2.95 eV for spiro-CZ and 2.97 eV for spiro-TPA, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was conducted to estimate the redox potential of HTMs. As depicted in Fig. S1, spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA undergo nearly reversible oxidation processes and present multiple redox peaks. The first couple of redox peaks were used to calculate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Both HTMs display similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels as listed in Table 1, which are well matched with those of MAPbI3 (Fig. 4b).

To confirm the thermal properties of spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out. As depicted in Fig. S2, the decomposition temperatures corresponding to a 5% weight loss are determined to be 457 °C for spiro-CZ and 487 °C for spiro-TPA. In addition, the obtained glass transition temperatures (Tg) are detected to be 154 °C and 142 °C, respectively (Fig. 2b). Encouragingly, these values are much higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (126 °C). The relatively high Tg values are favourable to form a uniform thin HTM film. The aforementioned TGA and DSC results reveal that these new HTMs are thermally stable.
Since the hole transporting behaviour of HTMs is of great importance for the performance of PSCs, a hole only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Ag was used to investigate the hole mobility by using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method. The corresponding results are summarized in Table S3, and I–V curves are plotted in Fig. 2d. The hole mobility of spiro-CZ is 6.65 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is superior to that of spiro-TPA (4.96 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). Similarly, the conductivity of the doped spiro-CZ film is nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of spiro-TPA (8.53 × 10−5vs. 4.83 × 10−5 S cm−1; Fig. 2c and Table S3). Thus, the spiro-CZ film possesses promising hole-transporting ability, allowing it to be an effective HTM.
Recently, Liang et al. reported that there is a direct correlation between molecular geometric configurations and intermolecular interaction. Thus, to understand the difference in conductivity and hole mobility, density functional theory (DFT) based calculations were performed. The optimized ground-state molecular configurations from the side view are depicted in Fig. 3. The carbazole units incorporated into spiro-CZ present a planar rigid structure, which favors effective intermolecular packing as well as enhanced hole mobility. Nevertheless, spiro-TPA bears twisted triphenylamine units, leading to poor intermolecular interaction and considerably decreased hole mobility. Furthermore, as illustrated in the mapped electrostatic potential (ESP) surface (Fig. 1b), more negative charge marked with yellow and red colours is observed in spiro-CZ. This result demonstrates that carbazole units act as electron-rich fused heterocycles in the whole molecule.

Due to the well-matched energy levels of HTMs with the perovskite layer (Fig. 4b), we fabricated p–i–n inverted PSCs (i-PSCs) with a sandwiched architecture of ITO/HTMs/MAPbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag, as shown in Fig. 4a. The details of the i-PSC fabrication processes can be found in the ESI part. All the HTMs were applied in i-PSCs without any dopants. The optimized concentration of HTM precursors was 5 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene. The thickness of the HTM layer was around 40 nm measured by using a DektakXT. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the best-performing devices are plotted in Fig. 4d, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 2. The i-PSCs based on the state-of-the-art HTM spiro-OMeTAD give an inferior PCE of merely 10.48% with a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.75 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.934 V and a fill factor (FF) of 71.2% in reverse scan, accompanied by a serious hysteresis effect. Another commercial HTM PEDOT:PSS offers an unsatisfactory PCE of 13.74% resulting from its poor Jsc and Voc, which arises from the drawback of mismatched frontier energy levels. In contrast, spiro-TPA and spiro-CZ demonstrate better photovoltaic performance in i-PSCs. Spiro-TPA-based i-PSCs exhibit a relatively high PCE of 15.44% with an improved Jsc of 22.67 mA cm−2, an increased Voc of 1.020 V, and a FF of 67.1% (reverse scan). Spiro-CZ-fabricated i-PSCs provide an Jsc of 22.33 mA cm−2, an Voc of 1.021 V, and an enhanced FF of 70.1%, contributing to a slightly high PCE of 15.81% (reverse scan). The devices endowed with spiro-TPA and spiro-CZ give a small hysteresis index (H-index), implying an unapparent hysteresis effect.

The J–V results were not well consistent with the hole mobility and conductivity. Generally speaking, spiro-CZ with high hole mobility should present much favourable performance in comparison with spiro-TPA with lower hole transporting properties. However, the two HTMs have shown nearly the same PCE. It is well known that the quality of polycrystalline perovskite determines the photovoltaic performance of PSC devices. Thus, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite were recorded. As shown in Fig. 4c, the perovskite layer deposited on both HTM films is compact and smooth with a similar grain size. XRD results demonstrated that spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA show a similar perovskite morphology (Fig. S3). As marked in the XRD spectra (Fig. 6b), the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were further recorded to elucidate the J–V results. As depicted in Fig. 4e, compared with pristine ones, both spiro-CZ/spiro-TPA-based perovskite films exhibit sharply quenched PL intensity, which indicates similarly efficient hole transfer at the interface of HTMs/perovskite layer. The above results indicate that the perovskite crystal quality is more important than the hole mobility in p–i–n structured PSCs. According to reports, low symmetry molecular configurations are conducive to preparing thin films with a good morphology. The morphology of the HTM film has an essential effect on the perovskite quality. Therefore, the spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA molecules with the same non-symmetric structure exhibit comparable performance. In addition, the device stability of spiro-CZ based i-PSCs was investigated. PEDOT:PSS was used as a control. The results are plotted in Fig. S4. After storing for 360 h in a dark ambient environment (∼30 °C and RH 40%), the devices based on spiro-CZ retained 71% of the initial PCE, while the devices using PEDOT:PSS retained only 54%. The poor device stability of PEDOT:PSS is ascribed to its acidic and hygroscopic nature, which will corrode conductive glass and decompose the perovskite layer.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of these two molecules as HTMs in n–i–p regular PSCs (r-PSCs), a commonly used r-PSC structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTMs/Ag was adopted as shown in Fig. 5a. The active perovskite layer was prepared as Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 through a one-step antisolvent method, while the optimized concentration of HTMs was 30 mM for spiro-CZ, 30 mM for spiro-TPA and 60 mM for spiro-OMeTAD. The HTM layers were thicker in the regular device in contrast to that in the inverted device due to the increased concentration. The thickness of the HTM layer was around 80 nm for spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA, and 120 nm for spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Fig. 5b shows the J–V curves for the optimized r-PSCs based on HTMs under AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, and the corresponding data are collected in Table 3. The r-PSCs with doped spiro-TPA yield a discouraging PCE of 8.47%, resulting from its poor Jsc of 18.86 mA cm−2, and an awful FF of 42% (reverse scan). Encouragingly, the devices based on doped spiro-CZ achieve a significantly increased Jsc of 22.47 mA cm−2, and an elevated FF of 67.6%, thereby leading to an improved PCE of 16.52% (reverse scan). Furthermore, a small hysteresis is observed. Although spiro-CZ-based r-PSCs exhibit a relatively lower PCE than spiro-OMeTAD-fabricated r-PSCs (18.64%) (reverse scan), they perform obviously well in inverted PSCs. The dual application toward inverted and regular perovskite solar cells not only decreases the waste of materials and research cost of photovoltaic devices, but also manifests the promising prospects of multidomain industrial applications (e.g., facile roll-to-roll technology, large-scale production, and silicon–perovskite laminated devices).

In general, r-PSCs with these two HTMs present comparable Voc due to their similar HOMO energy levels. Therefore, the considerable increase of PCEs for spiro-CZ-based r-PSCs is attributed to the enhanced Jsc and FF, which are thought to be due to the higher hole mobility and conductivity. To investigate the charge transfer dynamics at the interface between the HTMs and perovskite layers, steady-state PL characterization was performed. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, there is an obvious decrease of PL intensity for the HTM-coated perovskite film in contrast to that of pure perovskite. Moreover, compared to the perovskite film with spiro-TPA, the PL intensity of spiro-CZ/perovskite is quenched obviously, which is ascribed to the efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to the HTMs.
The distribution for r-PSCs constructed with different HTMs is displayed in Fig. 5d, and the corresponding data are summarized in Tables S4–S6. The devices show an average PCE of 16.16 ± 0.25% for spiro-CZ, 8.16 ± 0.30% for spiro-TPA and 17.90 ± 0.47% for spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Evidently, the spiro-CZ-based r-PSCs show high reproducibility. Therefore, spiro-CZ demonstrates promising industrial applications.

Device stability is essential to evaluate a promising HTM for PSCs. Thus, a long-term device stability test of spiro-CZ based r-PSCs was performed. Spiro-OMeTAD was used as a control. The corresponding stability data are summarized in Tables S7 and S8. As shown in Fig. 6a, after storing in a RH 40% and 30 °C environment, the unencapsulated devices with spiro-OMeTAD maintain 80% of the initial PCE over 450 h, whereas the r-PSCs with spiro-CZ exhibit superior stability with 80% of the initial efficiency after a long storage time of 1464 h. As reported, moisture-induced decomposition of the perovskite film is an important degradation pathway for r-PSCs. The introduction of methoxy units into triphenylamine increases the hydrophilicity of HTMs, and deleteriously accelerates the decomposition of the perovskite and weakens the device stability. In our design, spiro-CZ has only two donors with methoxy groups, half those of spiro-OMeTAD. Consequently, as depicted in Fig. 6b, a large contact angle of 85° with respect to water droplets is observed for spiro-CZ doped with LiTFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine. The contact angle for doped spiro-OMeTAD is 76° collected from our previous work. This indicates an excellent protection of the perovskite layer from moisture by the hydrophobic spiro-CZ film. It also clarifies that the design of HTMs with methoxy-free or few methoxy-based donors is effective for constructing efficient HTMs for stable PSCs.


In summary, two fluorene-based HTMs (spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA) were for the first time employed in p–i–n inverted and n–i–p regular PSCs. By the introduction of planar carbazole units as electron-rich fused heterocycles, spiro-CZ shows enhanced hole mobility and conductivity. Consequently, a high PCE of 16.52% was achieved for spiro-CZ-based regular PSCs as opposed to that of spiro-TPA with twisted triphenylamine as an electron donor (8.47%). However, contrary to expectations, the optimized PCEs of inverted PSCs with undoped spiro-CZ and spiro-TPA are comparable (16.06% and 15.79%, respectively). The performance of HTMs in regular and inverted PSCs is quite different. We proposed that HTMs containing a spiro-core are a good choice for inverted PSCs. A spiro-structured conformation supports high Tg and favors uniform thin HTM films, which is essential for the formation of high-quality perovskite crystals. However, the incorporation of a spiro-bridge with low symmetrical conjugation decreases the intermolecular interactions. This has a negative effect on the hole mobility and conductivity. Importantly, a photovoltaic test demonstrated that the capability of charge transport plays a crucial role in the efficiency of n–i–p regular PSCs. Therefore, it is better to incorporate spiro-featured HTMs with planar electron-rich donors for regular PSCs. This systematic work not only demonstrates that fluorene-based HTM spiro-CZ is an alternative to PEDOT:PSS but also provides effective design strategies for efficient organic HTMs for p–i–n and n–i–p structured PSCs.
