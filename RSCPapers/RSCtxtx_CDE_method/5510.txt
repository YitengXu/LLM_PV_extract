A novel approach for the synthesis of CoxNiyS nanoparticles on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and nickel-foam (Ni-foam) substrates for methanol oxidation in alkaline media is described. The introduced electrocatalyst was synthesized using different concentrations of cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) via a simple and effective process; the electrochemical properties were assessed by cyclic voltammetry. The Co90%Ni10% catalyst showed a current density of −0.576 and −0.801 mA on FTO and Ni-foam, respectively, which is the best for the oxygen reduction reaction. The observed electrocatalytic activity proves that the Ni content plays a crucial role in the enhanced current density. Co90%Ni10% also showed superior stability; 78.75% of the electroactive area remained compared to 67.31% in the case of Co0%Ni100% on Ni-foam. Moreover, the optimized catalyst was used as a counter electrode (CE) in quantum-dot sensitized solar cells and showed greater catalytic activity in a polysulfide redox electrolyte than CuS and Pt based CEs. As a result, under 1 sun illumination, Co90%Ni10% exhibited a power conversion efficiency of up to 2.89%, which was much higher than that of the Pt (1.32%) and CuS (2.03%) CEs. The power conversion efficiency of Co90%Ni10% was enhanced by the surface morphology, roughness factor, and current density, which permit prompt electron transport and lower the charge transfer resistance rate for the polysulfide redox electrolyte.

The increasing global population and energy demands as well as concerns regarding global warming have led to an increased focus on sustainable energy. In the 21st century, the use of electronic devices and appliances, such as smart phones, sensor nodes, and portable computing tools is doubling every 1.57 years according to Koomey's law, outstripping the growth efficiency of rechargeable energy sources, which is substantially constant. Over the last few years, green technologies implemented for power generation include the use of sun, air, and water as the input source, which have emerged as promising technologies. On the other hand, the development of green technologies thus far has been inadequate to satisfy the existing power requirements in the world. In this scenario, many researchers have focused on finding other alternatives to fulfill the existing power requirements. In recent years, the increased attention on fuel cells technology, is one of the new tools for the generation of clean, high proficient substitute energy for humans.

Fuel cells promise to be the future energy technology for portable and transportation devices. One of the challenges in the development of fuel cells is to maximize the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which allows high catalytic activity and durability. Methanol fuel cell cathodes have tremendous advantages because the energy is easier to supply to the community using existing infrastructure, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, and methanol is a liquid that can be easily managed and reserved. Moreover, methanol eliminates many of the difficulties associated with the use of compressed gases, such as hydrogen, where the infrastructure is inadequate. Methanol is also readily available at a consistent quality as a mass produced commodity that can be produced from agricultural biomass and has been examined as a renewable energy source. Thus far, most researchers are working on two types of fuel cells, direct methanol and ethanol fuel cells. Generally, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) comprise oxygen reduction and methanol oxidation on a precious metal catalyst.
On the other hand, DMFC cathodes have the complication of degradation due to methanol cross over and the requirement for a high cost catalyst. Commercially used effective electrocatalysts for the ORR, such as Pt and its alloys, have a high surface area, reasonably high mass activity, and superb catalytic properties for the ORR. The commercialization of DMFC with Pt as a catalyst is difficult because of the high price and limited reserves of Pt. In conjunction with electrolytes, however, Pt and other metals, such as Au, are not very catalytic, because they can be poisoned easily by CO or HCO species, leading to a rapid deterioration of the catalytic activity. Therefore, efforts have been made to investigate Pt-free electrocatalysts with high durability and activity, high methanol tolerance, simple methodology for deposition, and inexpensive non-metal or metal composite catalysts.
Transition metals have attracted attention as extremely active catalysts for the ORR compared to precious metals because of their abundance, low cost, and simple production. The properties of transition metals can be modified for electrocatalytic applications by modifying their structure, particle size, and profile. The addition of another metal to a catalytically active one to form an alloy can alter the binding strength, electronic and/or strain effect (spectator species), intermediates, and active surface sites (ensemble effect). Among the transition metals investigated, manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and nickel (Ni) have been demonstrated as acceptable candidates in terms of their cost-effectiveness and ORR electrocatalysis. The above transition metals are of significance because of their physical and electronic properties, such as tunable band gap, resistance against corrosion, and redox properties. Fundamental studies of well-defined extended surfaces have reported an increased catalytic activity with cobalt or copper as the main component, which increases the number of active sites usable for molecular oxygen. Limited work has been reported on the use of transition metals in the ORR, such as Co, Cu etc. On the other hand, it is not hypothetical to attain an equal range of activity improvement in nano-catalysts that are prepared by a co-precipitation or impregnation synthesis process due to homogenies, material shape, surface area, roughness, and lack of control over particle size.
The ORR in an aqueous solution occurs mainly by two pathways: 4e− reduction to hydroxide (eqn (1)) or 2e− reduction to peroxide (eqn (2)) followed by either another 2e− reduction of the peroxide (eqn (3)) or catalytic decomposition of the peroxide (eqn (4)). In any kind of fuel cell, the direct four-electron reduction pathway is preferred.
O2(g) + 2H2O(1) + 4e− → 4OH−(aq)
(1)
O2(g) + H2O(1) + 2e− → H2O−(aq) + OH−(aq)
(2)
HO2−(aq) + H2O(1) + 2e− → 3OH−(aq)
(3)
2H2O−(aq) → 2OH−(aq) + O2(g)
(4)
 On the other hand, the design and optimization of the counter electrode (CE) plays a vital role to further enhance the performance of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). However, to date, the currently recorded highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSSCs is typically around 11.6%, which is lower than the theoretical efficiency of QDSSCs (44%).
 The low-performance of QDSSCs is due to charge-recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and low-charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface. In QDSSCs, CuS and Cu2S CEs show relatively high catalytic activity toward the polysulfide redox system. However, Cu2S CEs can poison the photoanode surface when used in conjunction with the polysulfide redox couple, which decreases the photoelectric properties of the device. Therefore, to elevate the efficiency of QDSSCs, it is necessary to develop high-performance and novel electrocatalytic composite CE materials rather than a single CE material.

This paper reports CoXNiYSZ nanoparticles as non-precious electrodes for QDSSCs and methanol air fuel cells (MAFCs). The influence of the surface morphology and/or the Co:Ni composition ratio was examined and their electrocatalytic activity in QDSSCs as the CE was identified. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no reports till date using cobalt as the main component in CoXNiYSZ, composition variations. Moreover, their surface morphology-dependent effective electrocatalytic activity in QDSSCs and MAFCs has not been reported. The results suggest that the catalyst shows encouragingly stable electrochemical properties on voltage cycling and the Ni content in the metal sulfide nanoparticles has a distinct influence on methanol electro-oxidation due to the new electronic structure and synergetic impact. The resulting catalytic materials were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry.

Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate [(CH3COO)2CO·4H2O], urea [CH4N2O], thioacetamide [C2H5NS], nickel chloride hexahydrate [NiCl2·6H2O], zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide [Na2S], selenium [Se], sulfur [S], and cadmium acetate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. TiO2 paste [Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP] was purchased from Solaronix. The FTO conducting glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 14 Ω square−1 to prepare the CEs and photoanodes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.


Prior to CoXNiYSZ and Pt deposition, the FTO substrates were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone and ethanol, rinsed several times with deionized water, and then dried using an air drier. Cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (CoAc) and nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiHh) aqueous solutions were first prepared by dissolving different amounts of CoAc and NiHh (total amount of CoAc and NiHh was 1 g) in 30 mL of deionized water and stirred magnetically for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 0.4 M urea and 0.8 M thioacetamide were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and added slowly to the prepared solution.

The ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO substrates were dipped horizontally in a closed bottle containing the prepared aqueous solution and maintained at a deposition temperature of 90 °C for 120 min. The resulting films were cleaned several times with deionized water and ethanol to remove the unwanted particles and dried using a hair drier. For optimization of the NiHh and CoAc concentration, a 40 mL solution containing 0.4 M urea and 0.8 M thioacetamide was dissolved, in which Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, Co65%Ni35%, and Co0%Ni100%, of CoAc and NiHh was added. Urea was used as a strong stabilizing agent, which plays a more complex role in film preparation than simply adjusting the pH.
For comparison, a commercially available Pt paste (Solaronix, Platinum catalyst T/SP) was applied to the FTO substrate using the doctor-blade method and heat treated at 450 °C for 10 min in air. To prepare CuS CEs, well-cleaned FTO substrates were immersed in the 25 mL aqueous solution containing 0.1 M CuSO4.5H2O, 0.4 M C2H5NS and 0.2 M CH3COOH. The solution was kept in oven at 90 °C for 1 h. After deposition the films were cleaned with water and ethanol and labeled as CuS.

CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using the following procedure. (1) A dense nanosized TiO2 layer was deposited on cleaned FTO glass using the doctor blade technique and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. (2) To deposit rutile TiO2 nano flowers on the TiO2 film, a precursor solution was prepared, which contained 0.7 mL of titanium(IV) n-butoxide and hydrochloric acid (20 mL of 37%), and was added to 20 mL of deionized water and stirred for 30 min. A dense compact layer was deposited on TiO2 by the chemical bath deposition technique (CBD) at 95 °C for 45 min. The QD-sensitized materials were deposited on TiO2 by the successive ionic layer absorption and reaction method (SILAR), which is a simple and low-cost process that can be accomplished in a glass beaker. For the deposition of CdS, TiO2 with a dense compact layer film was dipped into an aqueous 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O solution for 5 min to allow the Cd2+ ions to coat the TiO2 electrode, washed with distilled water and ethanol for 1 min, and dipped into an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ ions react with S2− ions to form CdS. This completes a single SILAR cycle; five such cycles were performed to deposit CdS QDs on the TiO2/TiO2 dense compact layer. The above-mentioned SILAR method was then used to deposit CdSe QDs on the photoanode (8 cycles) with an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.2 M Se as the cation and anion sources, respectively.

The QD-sensitized photoanodes were finally dipped in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min each at room temperature and washed with distilled water and ethanol, and desiccated using a hair dryer. The passivating layer of ZnS may effectively cover the surface of the photoanode, resulting in the strong inhibition of corrosion due to the electrolyte and the prevention of back electron transfer into the polysulfide electrolyte.

The cells were constructed by assembling the anticipated TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanodes and the CEs were sandwiched between a 60 μm hot-melt sealing sheet (SX 1170-25, Solaronix) and filled with a droplet of polysulfide electrolyte. The polysulfide electrolyte aqueous solution consisted of 0.2 M KCl, 2 M S and 1 M Na2S in a mixture containing 3 mL of deionized water and 7 mL of methanol. To prepare the symmetric cells, the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, Co65%Ni35%, and Co0%Ni100%, and Pt films were sandwiched between a 60 μm hot-melt sealing sheet at 100 °C and the internal space was filled with a redox liquid electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S, 0.2 M KCl, and 2 M S with a methanol and deionized water ratio of 7:3.


The phase and crystallinity of the films were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The surface morphology and film thickness were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU-70 and Hitachi) operated at 10.0 kV, whereas the distribution of Co, Ni and S was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG scientific ESCALAB 250) was performed using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The photovoltaic performance (J–V curves) of the constructed solar cells was evaluated using an ABET technology (USA) solar simulator under one-sun illumination. The optical absorption of the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, Co65%Ni35%, and Co0%Ni100% CE films was examined using an OPTIZEN 3220 UV spectrophotometer. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out under light illumination using a Biologic potentiostat (SP-150, France) over the frequency range between 1 mHz and 100 kHz. The Tafel polarization measurements were conducted to identify the catalytic activity of the resulting CEs under dark conditions using symmetric dummy cells. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were obtained using a Biologic potentiostat (SP-150, France) in a conventional three-electrode system (Ag/Ag+, platinum wire and one of the various CEs were used as the reference, counter and working electrodes, respectively) with KOH solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV S−1. Atomic force microscopy was performed on a JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK instruments, Berlin, Germany.


The Co90%Ni10% catalysts were fabricated using a one-step simple chemical bath deposition method and used as an efficient electrode material for QDSSCs and fuel cells. The structure and morphology of the electrodes were investigated by XRD, XPS, EDX and FE-SEM analysis. Fig. 1 presents the XRD pattern of the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10% and Co85%Ni15% thin films on a FTO substrate. XRD peaks were observed at 39.95°, 46.46°, 49.46°, 55.10°, and 57.78° 2θ, which were assigned to the (2 1 1), (2 2 0), (2 2 1), (3 1 1), and (2 2 2) planes of CoS and match well with ICDD file no. 01-089-3056. The XRD peaks of the Co90%Ni10% and Co85%Ni15% films were similar to those of Co100%Ni0%, which might be because the XRD peaks of Co90%Ni10% and Co85%Ni15% are too weak to be detected.

XPS was conducted to determine the chemical composition of the sample surface and the oxidation state of the detected elements; the results are shown in Fig. 2. In the Co90%Ni10% film, the broad peaks of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 were located at 778.6 and 793.5 eV, respectively. The energy difference between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 levels was 15 eV, suggesting the coexistence of Co2+ and Co3+. In the Ni2p XP spectrum of Co90%Ni10%, the Ni2p3/2 components observed at 852.9 and 855.99 eV were attributed to Ni2+ and Ni3+ species, respectively, and the components located at 861.3 eV were related to a shake-up satellite of Ni3+ species. In the S2p spectrum, the binding energy at 162.15 eV was assigned to the sulphion in low coordination at the surface. The binding energy at 169.4 eV was attributed to the shakeup satellite. According to XPS analysis, the near-surface of the Co90%Ni10% film had a composition of Ni2p3, Co2p3, O1s, N1s, C1s, and S2p. The elemental composition was obtained by XPS by applying the relative sensitivity factors (RSFs) to the integrated peak areas, and the atomic ratio of Co/Ni/S was estimated to be 4:2:1, which matched well with the EDS results. Therefore, the XPS results suggest that Co90%Ni10% had been deposited successfully on the FTO surface.
EDX analysis was performed to investigate the elemental composition of the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, Co65%Ni35% and Co0%Ni100% thin films on the FTO substrate; the results are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. Elements in the FTO glass, such as C, O, and Sn, were also detected, which may be due to the low film thickness. Fig. 3A and E show that the atomic percentages of Co:Ni:S were 21.6:0:23.99 for Co100%Ni0% and 0:12.81:14.11 for Co0%Ni100%, respectively. The percentage of S in Co90%Ni10% was 11.08% and it decreased slightly to 6.81% for Co85%Ni15% and again increased from 6.81% to 22.51%, when the Co and Ni content was varied from 90% to 65% (Co) and 10% to 35% (Ni). The percentage of S in Co90%Ni10% and Co65%Ni35% was the highest and the film had a well-arranged coarse-grained and corrugated platelet structure with uniform pores that allow the polysulfide electrolyte to diffuse more freely. In addition to the surface morphology, the increase in the atomic percentage of S in the prepared films plays a crucial role in enhancing the electro-catalytic activity of the counter electrode. As the sulfur atomic percentage increases, the number of Co and/or Ni vacancies increases with increasing conductivity.

Fig. 4 shows top-view high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) images of the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, Co65%Ni35%, and Co0%Ni100% thin films deposited on FTO substrates using the CBD technique. The SEM image in Fig. 4A shows that the Co100%Ni0% film consists of bundles of nanoparticles fused together, leaving a naked conductive surface on the FTO glass. The naked conductive surface-based films in the QDSSCs results in the poor uniformity and low loading of Co and S particles on most of the FTO substrate area. The disadvantage can be overcome by adding a suitable amount of urea and Ni as a precursor and doping material. Urea is a strong reagent that can increase the hydrolysis rate of the prepared solution and rate of thioacetamide decomposition, so it can be spread well over the FTO glass to form a uniform film. SEM analysis of the Co90%Ni10% film revealed two morphologies; coarse-grained and corrugated platelets, which result in an adorned conductive surface on the substrate. The coarse-grained and corrugated platelets exhibited high catalytic activity and the adorned surface of the FTO substrates showed enhanced catalytic activity. At the same time, the densely packed platelets offer a sufficient surface area to allow the polysulfide electrolyte reduction. This is distinctive in structure with an improved surface modification from fused nanoparticles to coarse-grained and corrugated platelets. The surface morphology can be controlled by varying the concentrations of Co and Ni, as shown in Fig. 4. A higher concentration of Ni, such as a Co0%Ni100% atomic ratio of 0:12.81, produces a large spacing on the FTO substrate; light can pass through the empty spaces between the densely packed knit-coir-mat-like structure (Fig. 4F), providing high transparency.
The thicknesses of Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, Co65%Ni35%, and Co0%Ni100% were 876, 583, 833, 880, and 893 nm (Fig. S1, ESI), respectively. The deposition of the material gradually covers the full surface of the FTO substrate, which improves the catalytic activity because the reduction process is solely responsible for the injection of electrons from the counter electrode to the polysulfide electrolyte. From these analyses, it is evident that the different concentrations of Co and Ni do not affect the film thickness.
The presence of particles and surface roughness cannot be distinguished by SEM. To further characterize the above factors, AFM was carried out using a scanning probe atomic force microscope. Fig. 5 and Fig. S2 (ESI) show 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images of Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, Co65%Ni35%, and Co0%Ni100% films. The surface roughness of the Co90%Ni10% film was approximately 40.786 nm, which is larger than that of the Co100%Ni0% (35.240 nm), Co85%Ni15% (37.003 nm), Co65%Ni35% (39.711 nm), and Co0%Ni100% (31.025 nm) films. The rough surface structure of a catalyst has been suggested to be more advantageous for higher electrocatalytic activity and the oxygen reduction reaction. Among all the electrodes, the corrugated platelet structure was observed on the Co90%Ni10% film, which increases the active surface area and provides abundant active sites for the polysulfide electrolyte reduction. AFM indicates that the nickel content has a strong influence on the surface roughness, and nanoparticles having the composition of the Co90%Ni10% film showed distinct high performance; 31.46% higher than that of the Co0%Ni100% films. These results suggest that the variation of the Ni and/or Co concentration offers more electro-catalytic active sites for the reduction of S2−/Sn2−.

To evaluate the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared CEs, sandwich-structure QDSSCs with different CEs and a polysulfide electrolyte were assembled and tested under one sun illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 6A and Table 2 show the resulting J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters, including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and PCE. In our previous reports, the QDSSCs with a Pt CE showed a poor FF of 0.37, a PCE of 1.32%, a Jsc of 5.85 mA cm−2, and a Voc of 0.60 V. The low performance of the Pt CE was attributed to the strong absorption of S2− on the surface, which reduces the surface activity of Pt. Moreover, the QDSSCs with a Pt CE have a very high Warburg-coefficient (ZW), which causes poisoning of the Pt CE with the redox electrolyte, making it unstable. On the other hand, the QDSSC prepared using CuS (2.03%) as the CE performed poorly due to its inability to catalyze the polysulfide reduction (Fig. S3, ESI).

For the Co100%Ni0% CE, the FF and PCE were 0.51 and 1.53%, respectively. As the concentration of Ni was increased from 0% to 5%, the catalytic activity and PCE increased greatly (PCE = 2.89%). With further increases in the concentration of Ni to 15%, the power conversion efficiency was reduced from 2.89% to 1.84% because a higher Ni content in CoS has a strong negative influence on its electrocatalytic activity. The Co0%Ni100% CE has the lowest PCE (1.13%), FF (0.40), and Jsc (6.19 mA cm−2) among the four different samples, this was attributed to (1) the lower exchange current density, (2) the higher anodic slope in the Tafel plot than the cathodic slope, and (3) the negative corrosion potential (−0.024 V in Tafel polarization). Compared to the other CEs, Co90%Ni10% showed enhanced electro-catalytic activity and lower charge transfer resistance due to the very weak van der Waals forces between the S–S layers, which can voluntarily intermingle with anions and cations electrochemically.Fig. 6B presents the dark current-voltage characteristics of the cells. In QDSSCs, the current leakage was elucidated by charge recombination in the space charge region at low voltage biases. The optimized Co90%Ni10% electrode showed the lowest current leakage at low and reverse biases compared to the Co100%Ni0% and Co0%Ni100% processed cells.
To provide further evidence for the better electro-catalytic activity and the interfacial charge transfer properties of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple, Tafel polarization measurements were carried out under dark conditions with the symmetric cells.Fig. 6C presents the Tafel plot for Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co85%Ni15%, and Co0%Ni100%, as a function of the log of the current density vs. the applied potential for oxidation/reduction of the S2−/Sn2− couple. The Tafel polarization measurement is an important characterization technique in QDSSCs to evaluate the catalytic activity of a CE; the exchange current density (Jo) is estimated from the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel curve, which is related to the charge-transfer resistance according to eqn (5):
Jo = RT/nFRct
(5)
Jlim = 2nFCD/l
(6)
where
R is the gas constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of disulfide at the CE, T is the temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday constant, and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance obtained from EIS analysis. The Jo value of Co90%Ni10% is larger than those of Co100%Ni0%, Co85%Ni15%, and Co0%Ni100% CEs. This suggests that Jo for the Co90%Ni10% CE is slightly higher than that of the other electrodes, indicating that Co90%Ni10% CE shows a larger exchange current density. According to eqn (5), the Rct values of Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, and Co0%Ni100%, CEs were calculated to be 1.31, 0.96 and 1.49 Ω, respectively. The larger Rct value of the Pt CE reflects the lower amount of electrons transferred through the interface of the CE/electrolyte, which indicates the lower electron transfer capability of a CE.

The limiting current density (Jlim) can be derived from the curve in the high potential region, and the curves increase in the order of Co100%Ni0% < Co90%Ni10% < Co85%Ni15% < Co0%Ni100%. Jlim depends on the Zw and the diffusion coefficients of the redox couple in the symmetric dummy cell, and can be calculated using eqn (6), where l is the spacer thickness, D is the diffusion coefficient and C is the polysulfide concentration. As shown from Fig. 6C, the Jlim value of the Co90%Ni10% CE is higher than those of Co100%Ni0%, Co85%Ni15%, and Co0%Ni100%, respectively. The results suggest that a high surface roughness, surface area, and Co content in the metallic alloy nanoparticles has a distinct influence on the electrocatalytic activity.
Under open-circuit conditions, transient photo-voltage measurements were conducted by monitoring the photo-voltage decay rate, which is proportional to the rate of charge recombination. Fig. 6D presents the Voc decay curves as a function of time after interrupting light illumination within the QDSSCs based on the aforementioned four types of counter electrodes. The Co90%Ni10%-based cell exhibited a smaller rate of photo-voltage decay than the other three CEs, leading to moderate charge recombination kinetics, which was the best among the experimental results. The QDSSCs based on Co100%Ni0%, Co85%Ni15%, and Co0%Ni100%, exhibited the fastest voltage decay rate, indicating the fastest recombination rate; thus, a shorter electron life time was achieved. This Voc decay result is in accordance with the observed J–V parameters and EIS studies.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to examine the internal resistance, electron transport properties, recombination properties, interfacial charge transfer, and Warburg diffusion resistance in the polysulfide electrolyte. Each of the Nyquist plots consists of three semi-circles. From left to right, the preliminary point of the first semi-circle is the series resistance (RS), which is responsible for the transport resistance of FTO and all resistances outside of the QDSSCs. In the circuit, RCE represents the electron transport resistance at the CE/polysulfide electrolyte interface; RCT represents charge recombination in the conduction band of the photoanode/polysulfide electrolyte interface, which is parallel to the CE capacitance and corresponding photoanode chemical capacitance (Cμ). The right circle at the low frequency signifies the Warburg diffusion coefficient (ZW) in the polysulfide electrolyte. The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset in Fig. 7A and the resulting electrochemical parameters are shown in Table 2. Also, EIS analysis was carried out on the QDSSCs composed of the CuS CE with the polysulfide redox couple, and the Nyquist plot of CuS is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). The corresponding Nyquist plots were obtained over the frequency range of 100 mHz–500 kHz and measured at the open circuit voltage Voc (light condition).
The RS values for the QDSSCs with Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, Co0%Ni100%, and CuS were 7.38, 7.42, 9.39, and 10.02 Ω, respectively. In our previous studies, the QDSSCs with the Pt CE showed the highest RS and lower FF and PCE because the catalytic material is attached less strongly to the FTO substrate and Pt had the lowest conductivity. In contrast to the high RCE (19.04 Ω) of the Pt CE, all the RCE values of the transition metal-based CEs (1.31 Ω for Co100%Ni0%, 0.96 Ω for Co90%Ni10%, 1.49 Ω for Co0%Ni100% and 1.46 for CuS) were lower than that of the Pt CE, suggesting that transition metals have superior electrocatalytic activity to precious metals. In addition, for Co90%Ni10% CEs, the charge transfer resistance decreased obviously with the appropriate elemental composition of Co and Ni to the lowest one of 0.96 Ω, close to those of previous reports. The tendency of RCE for the Co90%Ni10% CE absolutely agrees with the tendencies of the FF and PCE listed in Table 2. The lower RCE value suggests that electrons injected at the CE/electrolyte interface from the external circuit were more efficient in the presence of Ni in CoS. The experimental outcomes showed that the RCE rate can vary as a function of the surface area, particle size, adhesion between the FTO and the material, the loading, and the surface roughness of the electroactive material, and most importantly, compositional variation played a decisive role in the electrocatalytic activity. The Co100%Ni10% film showed a similar response compared to Co90%Ni10% while Co0%Ni100% showed a very high RCE, low current density and FF due to lower surface roughness, greater particle size, less adhesion to FTO, and less collection of photo-excited electrons into the conduction band of the photoanode.
According to the EIS model, the electron lifetime (τe) was also calculated from the mid-frequency value (fmax) agreeing with the following formula (7):
τe = 1/2πfmax

Fig. 7B presents the corresponding Bode plot for the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, and Co0%Ni100% CEs for QDSSCs and Table 2 lists the calculated electron lifetime. The electron lifetimes of the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, and Co0%Ni100% CEs were 0.0020, 0.0023, and 0.0018 ms, respectively. In addition, Co90%Ni10% has a very low ZW (0.43 Ω) and RCT (3.86 Ω) providing its improved electrolyte diffusion and electrocatalytic activity, causing an enhanced chemical capacitance and high FF (0.53) results from the promotion of a large number of photo-excited charge carriers to the conduction band of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode arising from the low recombination rate. The QDSSCs with the Co100%Ni0%, and Co0%Ni100% CEs exhibited a very low electron lifetime due to the higher ZW value. Moreover, its electron lifetime (0.0020 ms for Co100%Ni0% and 0.0018 ms for Co0%Ni100%), which is inversely proportional to the fmax, supports its lower diffusion rate and lifetime enhancing the electron recombination rate, which causes poorer performance resulting in a PCE of 1.53 and 1.13%.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity of Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10% and Co0%Ni100% was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a KOH solution. In contrast to ruthenium, palladium, platinum, and gold, transition metal-based electrocatalysts, such as Co, Ni and Cu, exhibit their catalytic activity from the active layer deposited on the FTO surface. Comparative studies were performed on all catalysts under the same experimental conditions and an active surface area of 0.19 cm2. As shown in Fig. 8A, only one reduction peak was observed in the KOH solution at −0.327 V at a current of −0.225 mA. The magnitudes of the anodic and cathodic peak charge were increased greatly after adding nickel. When the nickel content was introduced, a typical CV of Co90%Ni10% showed two oxidation peaks at −0.32 and −0.202 V, which is associated with the desorption−adsorption of methanol ions on the Co90%Ni10%-based thin films. Only one reduction peak was observed in the Co100%Ni0% based films, whereas in the Co90%Ni10%-based film, there was significant enhancement in the reduction peak at −0.210 V at a current density of −0.576 mA. The appearance of higher redox peaks than Co100%Ni0% and Co0%Ni100% is an important finding because it can be considered an indicator of the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the Co90%Ni10%. Co0%Ni100% showed a reduction peak at −0.26 V at a current density of −0.327 mA, but only low electrocatalytic activity, which might be due to the absence of cobalt. The onset potential is a major indicator among the parameters for studying the ORR because it can provide information on the interaction of the prepared material with oxygen-containing species. The onset potentials of Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10%, and Co0%Ni100% were 0.90, 0.79, and 1.2 V, respectively. Generally in methanol electro-oxidation, lower and/or negative onset potentials show high activity.

The reduction peaks of Co100%Ni0% and Co0%Ni100% decreased gradually with increasing number of potential cycling from 1 to 101 cycles and similar peaks were observed for the Co90%Ni10% based film. The two oxidation and two reduction peaks of the Co90%Ni10% catalyst were still observed, whereas those for the Co0%Ni100% catalyst disappeared. Based on the CV stability test, the degradation of the material on the FTO substrate over the number of cycles was stronger for the Co100%Ni0% and Co0%Ni100% and low for the Co90%Ni10% based film. This was estimated by calculating the current density for the 2nd and 101st cycles. The current density decreased from −0.576 to −0.540 for the Co90%Ni10% catalyst; approximately 98% of the active CoNiS surface area remained after the 101st cycle. These results showed that the durability of the Co90%Ni10% catalyst was higher, which can be explained by both the Co–Ni interaction and optimized Ni composition.
The catalytic response of Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10% and Co0%Ni100% on the Ni foam was examined by CV in a 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1; the results are shown in Fig. 9. In cyclic voltammetry, it was observed that the reduction peaks for Co0%Ni100% on FTO (Fig. 8C) and Ni foam (Fig. 9C) had similar current densities. The ORR current density of Co100%Ni0% was the highest on Ni foam compared to the FTO substrate. Moreover, on FTO, no oxidation peak was observed, whereas on Ni foam, two oxidation peaks were observed at −0.30 and −0.122 V. No anodic peak was observed on FTO, whereas on Ni foam there was a significant enhancement in the anodic peak at −0.26 V at a current of −0.273 mA, indicating the high electrocatalytic activity of Co100%Ni0% on Ni foam as a substrate. Co0%Ni100% also showed two oxidation peaks (−0.431 V and −0.308 V at a current of 0.209 and 0.156 mA) and one strong reduction peak at −0.164 V at a current of −0.465 mA, but only showed low activity compared to Co90%Ni10%, which might be due to the absence of cobalt and insufficient electroactive sites. For CV with Co90%Ni10%, an elaborated peak could be observed for the cathodic peak at −0.141 V at a current of −0.801 mA, which might be due to the positive interactions of the nickel content with cobalt. The Co90%Ni10% thin film was predicted to have a higher electroactive surface area due to their coarse-grained and corrugated platelet-based structure and bundles of tiny small particles. As shown in Fig. 4A, the sample has a naked conductive surface between particles with small cracks that can form a discontinuous film and decrease the electroactive surface area. Table 3 lists the electrochemical parameters for the Co100%Ni0%, Co90%Ni10% and Co0%Ni100%-based films on the FTO and Ni foam substrates. A study of these Co90%Ni10% electrocatalytic nanostructures on the Ni foam substrate for the DMFC cathode is underway.

The optimal methanol concentration in a KOH solution is a necessary process parameter for efficient electrocatalysts.Fig. 9D–F display the influence of the methanol concentration on the oxidation reaction in a 1 M KOH solution with and without methanol at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The current densities of the Co90%Ni10% catalyst were remarkably higher in the presence of methanol than in the bare KOH solution. From the CV curves, the presence of methanol has a great influence on the thin films because methanol in a KOH solution can significantly suppress the hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks and generate a substantial methanol oxidation peak on the catalyst.Fig. 9E shows that this metal sulfide electrocatalyst is highly active towards methanol tolerance and the ORR. Therefore, the Co90%Ni10% catalyst is a promising cathode material for DMFCs.

Fig. 10 displays the sweep cyclic voltammograms in the presence of 1 M KOH at room temperature, which was tested between −1 and +1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1 for 101 cycles. In addition to the desirable higher electrocatalytic performance, the long-term stability of the prepared catalyst is another important parameter for its applications in fuel cells. The Co90%Ni10% electrocatalyst remained the most active and there was a small current drop from −0.830 to −0.65 mA during the stability test before and after 101 potential scans. In this work, only one catalyst was used in all the electrochemical analyses. After multiple electrochemical analyses, the working electrode did not alter its performance, which supports the greater long-term stability of the introduced catalyst. One of the major concerns for the good stability of a catalyst is to ensure the strong adhesion of Co90%Ni10% to the Ni foam. To prove this, the prepared electrode was placed in 40 mL of distilled water and ultrasonicated for 1 h. The Co90%Ni10% electrode showed a strong visible coating on the Ni foam even after 1 h of ultrasonication, suggesting strong adhesion between the active material and the Ni foam.
Considering the results of the EIS and cyclic voltammetry, it is clear that the Co90%Ni10% film displays greater catalytic activity for the ORR in KOH solution. In particular, the ORR performance of the Co90%Ni10% film displays an enhanced current-density of −0.801 mA and a lower onset potential than Co100%Ni0% and Co0%Ni100%. Cyclic voltammetry shows that our Co90%Ni10% catalyst displays greater stability than the other two catalysts. Further, cobalt sulfide and/or nickel sulfide are also not particularly effective ORR catalysts. The observed charge transfer resistance and catalytic activity of the Co90%Ni10% catalyst, thus, suggest a synergy between cobalt and nickel.

Co90%Ni10% catalytic nanostructures were developed successfully on FTO and Ni-foam electrocatalysts by a facile chemical bath deposition technique. Their catalytic activity as a CE and for the oxygen reduction reaction in QDSSCs and fuel cells was examined. FE-SEM images of the Co90%Ni10% film revealed coarse-grained and corrugated platelet structures, which show high catalytic activity and an adorned surface on the FTO surface. The synthesized electrodes exhibited lower charge transfer resistance and enhanced ORR performance, which was attributed to their surface roughness, adhesion, Ni-content, and the substrate. Moreover, the Co90%Ni10% film showed higher long-term stability and methanol tolerance than the Co100%Ni0% and Co0%Ni100%-based electrodes. The long-term stability and electrocatalytic activity toward methanol electroxidation depend mainly on the Co and Ni content on the FTO and/or Ni-foam. The QDSSCs based on Co90%Ni10% display an impressive power conversion efficiency of 2.89% with a Jsc of 6.90 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.55 V. The conductivity is increased with appropriate copper and nickel elements in Co90%Ni10%, which produced very low charge transfer resistance towards the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte than the Pt and CuS CEs. The behavior of this metal sulfide catalyst provides an impetus for further investigations of its use as a cathode in direct methanol fuel cells and as a CE in QDSSCs either alone or in combination with other transition metals.
