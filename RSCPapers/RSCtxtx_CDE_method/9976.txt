The performance of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSC) is restricted due to the insufficient electrocatalytic activity and stability of counter electrodes (CEs), which are critical but challenging issues. The exploration of CE catalysts to match the redox couples has become a feasible route in the pursuit of high power conversion efficiency, stability, and reduction of fabrication costs. Electrodes were made by the deposition of a PbS thin film on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate at various growth times by a facile one-step chemical bath deposition approach. They were used as a highly catalytic CE without any post-treatments for QDSSCs filled with aqueous sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) electrolyte. The morphology, thickness, crystal structure, composition, and optical properties are dependent on the growth time of PbS and were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, EDS, and UV-vis analysis. In addition to surface morphology, the increase in the atomic ratio of S in PbS plays a key role in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the CE. These PbS nano-cubes were used as an effective CE material in QDSSCs to show high electrocatalytic activity for catalyzing the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte, which contributes to significant improvement in the short current density and fill factor. The QDSSC with the optimized PbS CE exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 4.61%, which is much higher than that of Pt CE (1.34%). Furthermore, this PbS CE shows high and consistent electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfide reduction, which was confirmed by electrochemical measurements. This leads to improved photovoltaic performance and superior stability of the QDSSC.

Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are a promising liquid-junction photovoltaic device that could meet the requirements of third-generation solar cells. Quantum dots (QDs) have attracted much attention due to their simple synthetic procedure and high theoretical thermodynamic efficiency (44%), which benefits from a high molar extinction coefficient, multiple exciton generation, hot-carrier transfer, and tunable optical absorption of QDs. The principle of QDSSCs is similar to that of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with inorganic QDs replacing the dye molecules as incident light absorbers. A typical configuration of QDSSC devices includes a nanoporous TiO2 anode sensitized with QDs, an electrolyte containing a redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE). Despite significant strides in QDSSC research, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of state-of-the-art QDSSCs has just recently reached >7% with the optimization and design of QD sensitizers.

Besides photoanodes, careful selection, optimization, and design of the CE and electrolyte are equally important paths to improving the performance of QDSSCs. The CE is responsible for catalysis and reduction of the oxidized redox species. It transfers electrons from the external circuit to the electrolyte and keeps the cell working. Therefore, more active and stable catalysts for efficient CEs are needed to efficiently reduce Sn2− to nS2− for boosting the PCE of QDSSCs, and they should be able to tolerate the electrolyte environment.
The iodide/tri-iodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte used in a DSSC is not a successful candidate for a QDSSC as it causes photocorrosion of the QDs. To date, the optimal redox couple for QDSSCs is the polysulfide electrolyte (S2−/Sn2−), which can efficiently stabilize the cadmium chalcogenide QD sensitizers and provide higher photovoltaic performance. Moreover, platinum (Pt) proves to be a successful candidate as a CE for DSSCs with appreciable electrocatalytic activity for the redox of I−/I3−. However, the Pt electrode is not suitable for QDSSCs because of its strong chemisorption with sulfide ions, which would decrease the surface activity and conductivity of the Pt electrodes and result in poor photovoltaic performance of the resulting cell devices. Therefore, alternative low-cost CE materials with relatively high catalytic activity are needed to improve the performance of QDSSCs.
Researchers have made great effort to develop new materials and novel structures of CEs, such as Cu2S, CuS, CoS, NiS, PbS, and carbon-based CEs. Among them, Cu2S CEs show the highest electrocatalytic activity toward reduction of polysulfide species in QDSSCs. However, it has been reported that Cu2S CEs can poison the photoanode surface through both diffusion- and field-assisted deposition of CuxS, resulting in a gradual decrease of photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, Cu2S CEs suffer from mechanical instability and uncertainty due to the reaction of copper and the electrolyte.
Zaban et al. reported a PbS CE grown directly on Pb foil and achieved a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 130 Ω, efficiency of 3.01%, and quite good stability. Zhang et al. reported a PbS as a CE for CdSe QD-sensitized ZnO (SnO2) thin film and achieved a PCE (η) that was greatly increased from 1.21 to 1.75%. Meng et al. fabricated a PbS/carbon black (CB) composite CE for highly efficient CdS/CdSe QDSSCs and obtained he efficiency of 3.91%. Very recently, Fu et al. reported a highly catalytic PbS CE on FTO substrate using chemical bath deposition (CBD) method for highly efficient CdS QDSSCs. The CdS QDSSC with the PbS CE achieved a power energy conversion efficiency of 2.91% and showed no obvious degradation of the current density over 72 h under ambient conditions.
A PbS CE was prepared by electroplating and showed catalytic activity similar to that of CoS and Cu2S CEs but with inferior long-term stability. These results suggest that PbS is a prospective catalyst that can be applied as a highly efficient CE in QDSSCs. However, some issues of the PbS CE still have to be solved before it becomes competitive enough: (1) the value of Rct is too large compared with the value of ∼10 Ω of other metal sulfides; (2) the stability of the PbS CE is still questioned due to the slow reaction between Pb foil and polysulfide redox couple, and (3) the utilization of metal-foil-based CEs is unsatisfactory, especially for cell sealing and large-scale application. Therefore, it is important to develop new ways to overcome the current challenges of PbS CEs.
We developed a facile one-step strategy to fabricate PbS nanostructure thin films on FTO substrates via CBD. We applied them directly as CEs in QDSSCs without any post-treatments such as annealing or coating with auxiliary materials. We found that the surface morphology and Pb:S ratio are affected by the deposition time. The CE/electrolyte interface plays a major role in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity in QDSSCs. Hence, it is essential to understand whether the surface morphology or Pb:S ratio affect the electrocatalytic activity of PbS film CEs in QDSSCs. A model CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSC constructed with the as-prepared PbS CEs was used to evaluate their performance. Our results show that the cell based on a PbS CE provides a PCE of 4.61% under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which is much higher than that with a Pt CE (1.34%). Furthermore, the QDSSCs based on the PbS CE show outstanding stability in working conditions under continuous illumination for over 100 h without a distinct decrease in PCE.

Lead(II) nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), thioacetamide (C2H5NS), L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S), cadmium acetate dehydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide (Na2S), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), potassium chloride (KCl), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), and TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP) were supplied by Solaronix. All other chemicals were commercially available and of analytical grade.


Nanostructured PbS thin films were deposited on FTO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω cm−2 (Hartford Glass) by CBD. Prior to thin film deposition, FTO substrates were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and distilled (DI) water for 10 min each. The well-cleaned FTO substrates were used to prepare PbS CEs. 0.1 M Pb(NO3)2 and 0.4 M C2H5NS were dissolved in 25 mL of DI water, and vigorously stirred for 30 min. Under constant stirring, 0.02 M of C3H7NO2S was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min. The FTO substrates were immersed into the growth solution horizontally and placed in a hot air oven. The deposition was carried out at different growth times of 45, 60, 90, and 120 min at 80 °C. After the completion of each deposition time, the samples were removed from the oven and cleaned with DI water and ethanol. The PbS films were labeled as PbS45, PbS60, PbS90, and PbS120 according to the growth times.

To fabricate the Pt electrode, a well-cleaned FTO glass substrate was coated with a Pt paste (Pt-catalyst T/SP, Solaronix) using the doctor blade method with an area of ∼0.7 cm2 and sintered at 450 °C in air for 10 min.

Ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO substrates were used for the fabrication of a photoanode. TiO2 paste with a particle size of 20 nm (Ti-Nanoxide HT/TP, Solaronix) was coated on FTO by the doctor blade method with an active area of 0.27 cm2 and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, producing a thickness of 7.5 μm after solvent evaporation. To prepare TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS films, the highly ordered TiO2 films were sequentially sensitized with CdS and CdSe QDs by the SILAR method. First, the TiO2 film was dipped into 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O aqueous solution for 5 min, rinsed with DI water and ethanol, dipped for 5 min in 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution, and rinsed with DI water and ethanol. The two-step dipping procedure corresponded to one SILAR cycle, and the incorporated amount of CdS QDs was increased by repeating the assembly cycles for a total of five cycles.

For the subsequent SILAR process of CdSe QDs, an aqueous Se solution was prepared by mixing 0.2 M Se powder and 0.4 M Na2SO3 in 50 mL of DI water at 120 °C for 4 h. The TiO2/CdS samples were dipped in 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O aqueous solution for 5 min, rinsed with DI water and ethanol, dipped in the Se aqueous solution for 5 min at 50 °C, and rinsed with DI water and ethanol. The two-step dipping procedure corresponds to one SILAR cycle. Repeating the SILAR cycle increases the amount of CdSe QDs (for a total of eight cycles). The SILAR method was also used to deposit the ZnS passivation layer. The TiO2/CdS/CdSe samples were coated with ZnS by alternately dipping the samples in 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S solutions twice for 2 min per dip and rinsing with DI water and ethanol between dips (for a total of two cycles). The as-prepared samples are named as TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS.

The as-prepared TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode and the fabricated PbS CEs were sealed using a sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C. The space between the electrodes was filled with polysulfide electrolyte consisting of 1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.1 M KCl in methanol and water at a ratio of 7:3. The cells were left for a few hours for complete diffusion of the electrolyte within the photoanode and then tested under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2.


Symmetrical PbS and Pt electrodes were sealed using a sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) at 100 °C. The internal space of the symmetrical device was filled with the polysulfide electrolyte. Tafel polarization with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) for the symmetrical dummy cells with PbS/PbS, and Pt/Pt CEs in dark conditions in a frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz.


The surface morphology, thickness, and elemental compositions of the electrodes were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) operated at 15 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a D8 ADVANCE with a DAVINCI diffractometer (Bruker AXS) using Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation of 1486.6 eV and an electron take-off angle of 90°. The surface roughness of the substrates prepared using CBD (NiS and NiS/PbS) was characterized by atomic force microscope (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M S, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a BioLogic electrochemical analyzer. Pt worked as a CE, and Ag/Ag+ worked as a reference electrode. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of QDSSCs were examined under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the QDSSCs using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) under one sun illumination at frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 500 kHz. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set to VOC of the QDSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The electrical impedance was characterized using Nyquist and Bode plots. To perform the stability test, QDSSCs based on PbS and Pt CEs were continuously irradiated with AM 1.5G radiation at 100 mW cm−2 in working conditions, and the J–V curves were tested for 100 h.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of PbS thin films on the FTO substrate at different deposition times. The diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ of 25.9°, 30.0°, 43.0°, 50.9°, 53.4°, 68.9°, and 78.9°, which correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (331), and (422) planes of a PbS cubic structure (ICDD file no. 05-0592). For PbS45, the peak at 25.9° corresponding to the (111) plane has the lowest intensity. The intensity and full width at half-maximum increased upon increasing the deposition time from 60 to 120 min. This suggests that PbS45 is less crystalline, and the crystallinity is improved from PbS45 to PbS120 owing to the increase in the film thickness.

A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the surface morphology of the as-prepared PbS thin films on FTO substrate at different deposition times, as shown in Fig. 2. The surface morphology of the films is greatly influenced by the deposition time. The SEM image of PbS45 showed small nanostructures, and cube-like crystallites started to form on the surface of the FTO. The PbS60 films consisted of distinct cubic crystallites with size ranging from 548 to 962 nm. As the time increased to 90 min (PbS90), the density and size (625–1126 nm) of cubic crystallites increased. As the time increased further (PbS120), there was a corresponding reduction in the density of cubes with increment in the crystallite size leading to more densely packed PbS films.
The thicknesses for the PbS45, PbS60, PbS90, and PbS120 samples were 1.15, 1.42, 1.57, and 1.80 μm, respectively. The measured thickness is the combined thickness of FTO and PbS. The improved surface morphology of PbS material covered the FTO surface would improve catalytic activity because the reduction process is responsible for injection of electrons from the CE to the electrolyte. From these analyses, it is evident that the deposition time has a substantial effect on the growth, crystallization, and thickness of PbS films.
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was used to investigate the elemental compositions of the PbS thin films on the FTO substrates at different amounts of time, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The data show that the atomic percentages of Pb:S were 53.64:46.36, 52.03:47.97, 51.19:48.81, and 52.59:47.41 in the PbS45, PbS60, PbS90 and PbS120 electrodes, respectively. The percentage of S in PbS45 was found to be 46.36%, and it increased to 47.91% and 48.81% when the deposition time was increased to 60 and 90 min. However, upon increasing the growth time to 120 min, the percentage of S is lower and the formation of Pb is much faster than that of S, resulting in less S content (47.41%). The percentage of S in PbS90 is the highest at 48.81%, and the film has well-arranged cubic crystallite structure with uniform pores that allow the electrolyte to diffuse more freely. Apart from the surface morphology, the increase in the atomic ratio of S in Pb:S also plays an important role in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the CE.
AFM technique was further used to examine the surface of the PbS films. To study the surface roughness of the different films, high-resolution tapping-mode AFM was applied. The corresponding 3D images are shown in Fig. 4. The surface roughness of the PbS90 film was around 141.5 nm, which is much larger than that of PbS45 (58.8 nm), PbS60 (130.7 nm), and PbS120 (121.9 nm). It has been suggested that rough surface structure of a CE thin film is advantageous for its electrocatalytic activity. Ordered cubic structures were observed on the PbS90 film, which enlarge the surface area and provide more active sites for the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte. The results confirmed the attractive performance of the PbS90 film as a catalyst on a CE for QDSSCs.
XPS spectra were obtained to study the chemical states of Pb and S, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) shows the XPS survey spectra of the surface of PbS90 film. The characteristic peaks of Pb4f, S2p, C1s, and O1s are all shown in PbS. The two main peaks located at 141.9 eV and 137.0 eV Fig. 5(b) were assigned to Pb4f5/2 and Pb4f7/2, respectively, and are attributed to Pb2+ in PbS. The S2p peaks in Fig. 5(c) at 161.5 eV (S2p3/2) and 160.3 eV (S2p1/2) are both attributed to PbS. Therefore, the XPS results suggest that the PbS was successfully deposited on the surface of FTO.
To further characterize the electrodes, the absorption spectra of PbS CEs fabricated with different growth times were investigated. As observed in Fig. 6, the deposition of PbS on FTO film clearly extends the absorption spectrum to wavelength exceeding 1000 nm. Furthermore, the absorbance increased with the growth time of PbS, indicating that the growth time increased the thickness of the PbS film. The red shift of the absorption spectra is due to the size quantization effects as the growth time increased, indicating sequential growth of the PbS nano-cubes. The advantage of absorbing long-wavelength irradiation makes PbS a suitable CE material for harvesting the residual light that penetrates the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode. Under illumination, PbS may result in a positive shift of the quasi-Fermi level and enhance the open circuit voltage of the QDSSC.
In order to demonstrate the reaction kinetics and electrocatalytic abilities of the CEs in the presence of polysulfide electrolyte, CV measurements were done with a standard three-electrode electrochemical system. The three-electrode system was composed of a working electrode, Pt CE, and SCE reference electrode, while an aqueous solution of 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M S was used as the electrolyte. The corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. 7(A). In QDSSCs, photo-excited electrons from the QDs are injected into the conduction band of TiO2, and the oxidized QDs are reduced by S2− ions in the polysulfide electrolyte. The simultaneous presence of sulfur with S2− results in the formation of polysulfide (Sn2−), and the oxidized species Sn2− has to be reduced to S2− on the CE. The redox reactions at the photoanode and CE are represented by eqn (1) and (2), respectively:

S2− − 2e− → S; S + S2− → Sn2−

(1)

Sn2− + 2e− → Sn−12− + S2−

Compared with PbS CEs, Pt shows very low electrocatalytic activity in polysulfide electrolyte caused by its irreversibility and overpotential due to physisorption. Both PbS60 and PbS120 electrodes show a considerable amount of reversibility with moderate current peaks, which leads to reasonable electrocatalytic activity, but the PbS45 electrode exhibits much less electrocatalytic activity. The PbS90 CE shows a higher current peak relative to that of Pt and other PbS CEs. This is because the reduction rate of Sn2− is higher on the PbS90 CE compared to other CEs, so it tends to have a higher current peak. This result reveals that the PbS90 CE has better electrocatalytic activity in polysulfide electrolyte.
Chemical/electrochemical stability experiments of the Pt and best performing PbS90 CEs were examined by CV for 50 consecutive cycles, and the corresponding CV plots are shown in Fig. 7(B) and (C). Upon repeated cycling, the current of the Pt electrode decayed to its initial value. This observation is in accordance with previous literature and it is believed to be caused by easy adsorption of polysulfide redox species on the Pt surface leading to increased resistance and thus reducing its stability. The PbS90 thin film-based electrode showed much better reproducible cycling behavior, with negligible decay in current over the duration of the measurement. This indicates that PbS90 adhered strongly to the FTO surface and possesses very high electrocatalytic stability. This shows that the PbS90 CE is both highly electrocatalytic and stable.
To interpret the electrocatalytic behaviors of PbS and Pt CEs related to photovoltaic performance, EIS measurements were first carried out using symmetrical cells assembled with two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE). Nyquist plots of dummy cells are presented in Fig. 8 (under dark conditions), which illustrates the impedance characteristics of different CEs in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz. The impedance characteristics of CEs in polysulfide electrolyte are determined by several operational circuit elements, such as series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and Warburg diffusion impedance (ZW). Mainly, Rct is considered as a pivotal parameter in determining the catalytic activity of CE catalysts. According to the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 8, the high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents Rs, and the left arc in the middle-frequency region is assigned to Rct with chemical capacitance Cμ. The EIS curves were well fitted using the equivalent circuit. All the parameters determined from the fitted Nyquist plots in Z-view software are summarized in Table 1.

The Rs values of the PbS45, PbS60, PbS90, and PbS120 electrodes are 8.41, 5.62, 4.22, and 6.61 Ω, respectively, which are much lower than the Rs value of the Pt electrode (13.07 Ω). The smallest Rs value of PbS90 CE shows better conductivity than that of the FTO-glass substrate used in other CEs. This could be attributed to the good bonding strength between the PbS90 film and the FTO substrate, which promotes the collection of more electrons from the external circuit. This is consistent with previous reports. As expected, PbS CEs had a much lower Rct in comparison with the Pt CE (208.92 Ω). Encouragingly, Rct of the PbS90 CE (3.79 Ω) was much lower than that of PbS45 (23.57 Ω), PbS60 (7.12 Ω), PbS120 (9.79 Ω) CEs, which indicates superior catalytic capability of the PbS90 CE for the reduction of Sn2−.
As for the PbS and Pt electrodes, the large Cμ values (PbS45, 296.14 μF; PbS60, 510.62 μF; PbS90, 613.87 μF; PbS120, 485.35 μF; Pt, 7.49 μF) indicate that PbS60 and PbS90 electrodes have a large surface area, which increases their catalytic activity. In addition, the PbS90 CE delivered the smallest ZW of 1.74 Ω, while PbS60 (2.06 Ω) and PbS120 (3.13 Ω) CEs show moderate ZW values. PbS45 and Pt CEs have the highest ZW values of 6.12 and 11.55 Ω, implying much more efficient diffusion of the polysulfide electrolyte at the interface of the PbS90 CE and electrolyte. The decreased ZW and Rs may lead to remarkably increases fill factor (FF) of QDSSCs fabricated with the PbS90 CE. Therefore, all these parameters jointly contribute to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the PbS90 CE, which enhances the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs.
In order to provide further evidence of the better electrocatalytic activity and the interfacial charge transfer property of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple, Tafel polarization measurements were also conducted with the dummy cells (PbS and Pt CEs) used in EIS experiments at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Fig. 9 shows the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of voltage for the oxidation/reduction of Sn2− to nS2−. Tafel polarization measurement is an important characterization method to evaluate the catalytic activity of a CE, as the exchange current density (J0) estimated from the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel polarization curves is related to the charge-transfer resistance according to eqn (3):
(3)
where
R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the polysulfide reduction, F is the Faraday constant, and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance. The slopes for the anodic and cathodic branches are in the order of PbS90 > PbS60 > PbS120 > PbS45 > Pt. It is clearly evident from Fig. 9 that the J0 value of PbS90 is the greatest among the other PbS films (PbS45, PbS60, and PbS120). The J0 values gradually increased with the deposition time from 45 to 90 min and was reduced from 90 to 120 min. This observation implies that the electrocatalytic activity for the polysulfide reduction depends on the deposition time of the PbS films. According to eqn (3), the larger slope for the PbS90 electrode represents larger J0, which is in good agreement with the EIS results.

The limiting current density (Jlim) was determined by the diffusion of ionic carriers between the two electrodes. Jlim is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient (D) of the polysulfide redox couple. The Jlim value of the Pt CE is lower than that of PbS CEs, resulting in lower diffusion coefficient:
(4)
where
D is the diffusion coefficient of the polysulfide, l is the electrolyte thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of disulfide at the CE, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the polysulfide concentration. As shown in Fig. 9, Jlim and D increase in the same order of PbS90 > PbS60 > PbS120 > PbS45 > Pt, which is consistent with the EIS analysis of ZW.

To evaluate the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared PbS CEs, sandwich-structure QDSSCs with PbS CEs and sulfide/polysulfide as the electrolyte were assembled and tested under 1 sun illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 10 shows the J–V characteristics of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS sensitized solar cells fabricated with different CEs (PbS and Pt). The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters including open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE (η) are summarized in Table 2.

Similar to previous reports, the QDSSC based on the Pt CE shows very low photovoltaic performance with η of about 1.34%. The low performance is due to the very low electrocatalytic activity of the Pt CE in polysulfide electrolyte resulting from the strong absorption of S2− ions on the surface of Pt, which reduces the surface activity of Pt. As a result, a relative low FF (0.272) is obtained by the QDSSC based on the Pt CE. A PbS CE is well known to exhibit high electrocatalytic activity in polysulfide solution, which improves the FF and η of the QDSSC.
For the PbS45 CE, FF and η were about 0.566 and 3.39%, respectively. As the deposition time of PbS was increased to 60 min (PbS60), the catalytic activity and performance were greatly enhanced (η = 4.17%). When further increasing the deposition time to 90 min (PbS90), the cell exhibited the highest η of 4.61% with VOC, JSC, and FF values of 0.644 V, 12.17 mA cm−2, and 0.588, respectively. However, increasing the deposition time to 120 min (PbS120 CE) reduced cell performance because JSC and FF were reduced, but the overall η (3.57%) was still much higher than that of the reference Pt and PbS45 CE. The PbS45 electrode has the lowest performance among the PbS samples, which originated from the lack of electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfide reduction due to the insufficient amount of PbS catalyst. Significant improvement in charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface reduces internal resistances, recombination rates, and concentration gradients in the polysulfide electrolyte, which are parameters that strongly affect the photovoltaic performance.
The PbS electrode serves as a CE and photocathode to facilitate electron injection to the polysulfide electrolyte to achieve a higher photovoltaic performance. The fast charge transfer at the PbS CE/electrolyte interface causes a variation in the ion concentration in the solution and influences the recombination rates at the interface of the working electrode and electrolyte. VOC of the cell is the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi levels (qEf) of the anode and cathode. The quasi-Fermi level of either the anode or cathode depends on the equilibration between the electrode and electrolyte solution. The relatively small improvement in VOC seems to be the result of a more positive potential of the catalytic PbS in the electrolyte. Consequently, the measured improvement in all cell parameters upon introduction of the PbS90 CE to the cell is a strong indication for enhanced catalytic activity of the PbS in conjunction with the polysulfide electrolyte.
In a QDSSC, the electron transport, recombination, and lifetime can directly influence the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, EIS was employed to characterize the charge transfer kinetics of CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs-sensitized solar cells, and the obtained Nyquist plots for the frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz are shown in Fig. 11(a). The Nyquist plots were measured at open circuit voltage VOC under illumination of one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 11(a), the Nyquist plots exhibited three semicircles that corresponded to the electron injection at the CE/electrolyte interface and transport in the electrolyte at high frequencies (RCE, first semicircle), the electron transfer at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface and transport in the TiO2 film (Rct, second semicircle), and the Warburg diffusion (ZW) in the electrolyte (third semicircle at low frequency). The starting intersect point of the first semicircle is the series resistance Rs, which is the transport resistance of FTO and all resistances outside of the cell. RCE and Rct are parallel to the corresponding CE capacitance (CCE) and chemical capacitance (Cμ). The equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 11(a) is used to fit the Nyquist plots using Z-view software, and the obtained parameters are summarized in Table 2.
Rct is not discussed since the value is not directly influenced by the choice of CE materials. Rs of the PbS90 CE (7.56 Ω) is lower than that of other CEs (PbS45 = 8.14 Ω; PbS60 = 7.64 Ω; PbS120 = 7.75 Ω; Pt = 13.02 Ω) because the conductivity of FTO is better for PbS90. The charge-transfer resistance (RCE) of the PbS90 CE is much lower than the others, which means lower charge transfer resistance between the surface of CE and the polysulfide electrolyte. Furthermore, the PbS90 CE has the highest Cμ of 672.15 μF, indicating higher charge accumulation, as shown in Fig. 11(a). Moreover, high Cμ of a QDSSC is mainly related to collection of more photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of the photoanode due to low recombination. The low values of RCE and ZW of PbS90-based QDSSCs lead to higher efficiency. The low ZW value of PbS electrodes indicates better electrolyte diffusion, facilitates faster mass transport of electrons, and improves the performance of the QDSSC by increasing JSC and FF.
Fig. 11(b) shows the Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra. The lifetime of electrons (τe) in the PbS-based QDSSC can be estimated from the maximum frequency of the peak:
(5)
The τe value obtained for the PbS45, PbS60, PbS90, PbS120, and Pt CEs in QDSSCs are 0.31, 1.02, 5.01, 0.57, and 0.048 ms, respectively. τe first increased from 0.31 ms to 5.01 ms (PbS45 to PbS90) with the increase of deposition time from 45 min to 90 min and then decreased to 0.57 ms for PbS120. The increase in τe supports the reduction of electron recombination rate with the polysulfide electrolyte. The low τe of the Pt CE is due to the higher recombination of the injected electrons with the polysulfide electrolyte, which tends to reduce τe of the electrons (with fast back reaction with the electrolyte). Among the investigated samples, PbS90 exhibits a lower RCE and higher τe, which contribute to the higher photovoltaic performance of the QDSSCs.
To investigate the CE effect of the PbS films, we measured the VOC decay curves of the QDSSCs with PbS and Pt CEs, as shown in Fig. 12. The VOC decay measurement has been widely used in DSSCs and QDSSCs. Under open-circuit conditions, the equilibrium between electron accumulation and electron loss is established when illuminated, and the concentration of electrons achieves steady state. When the illumination is turned off, VOC begins to decay due to charge recombination and the decrease of electron concentration. Therefore, the measurements can provide some useful information about the electron recombination processes, typically the recombination rate of the photo-generated carriers with oxidized species in the polysulfide electrolyte.
The rate of VOC decay is inversely proportional to the lifetime of photoelectrons in QDSSCs, and the lifetime of electrons is inversely proportional to the recombination rate. A larger VOC decay time thus means that the electrons have a slow recombination rate. The electron lifetime (τe) at different potentials can be determined from the VOC decay spectra according to eqn (6):
(6)
where
kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the electronic charge. The VOC decay of the QDSSC with the PbS90 CE decays more slowly than those of the PbS45, PbS60, PbS120, and Pt devices. This suggests that the PbS90 CE has a low recombination rate and superior electron lifetime in the QDSSC. The slower recombination rate of electrons indicates that a large number of electrons survive from the reverse reaction, which is beneficial for improving QDSSC performance.

Besides η, another important aspect of QDSSCs is their long-term stability. We have investigated the performance of CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs with PbS90 and Pt CEs under continuous light soaking for 100 h with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 13 shows the extracted photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and η) of PbS and Pt CEs. Initially, the cell with the PbS90 CE shows the values VOC, JSC, FF, and η of 0.644 V, 12.17 mA cm−2, 0.588, and 4.61%, respectively. When the illumination is continued to 100 h, the photovoltaic parameters of the QDSSC based on the PbS90 CE slightly increased with time (VOC = 0.653 V; JSC = 12.34 mA cm−2; FF = 0.592, and η = 4.77%). The performance of the QDSSC using the Pt CE appears to decrease at a faster rate compared to that of the cell using the PbS90 CE. The slight increase in FF (0.301 to 0.334) of the Pt CE compensates for the loss of JSC, resulting in a slow reduction of efficiency during illumination (1.52 to 1.25%).

In conclusion, different PbS thin-films have been deposited on FTO glass by an extremely facile CBD method that can be used in large-scale production. We have demonstrated that the films function as highly efficient electrocatalytic CEs for QDSSCs. Increasing the growth time affects the surface morphology, density of nano-cubes, ratio of Pb:S, and thickness. Particularly, the time-dependent PbS nano-cubes prepared with improved morphologies exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than the commonly used Pt CE towards the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte. Still, it is noteworthy that the PbS CE exhibits excellent chemical and electrochemical stability than the Pt CE in the sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte (as demonstrated in 50 consecutive complete cycles of CV measurement).

The CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDSSCs with the optimized PbS CE using methanol/water electrolyte showed the highest PCE of 4.61% under 1 sun illumination, which was better than that of the Pt CE (1.34%). The PbS nano-cubes provide more active sites to catalyze the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte, accelerate electrolyte transport, and promote fast charge transport and diffusion velocity of the redox couple. Considering their easy fabrication, stability, and high energy conversion efficiency, PbS has been demonstrated as a promising CE material for QDSSCs.
