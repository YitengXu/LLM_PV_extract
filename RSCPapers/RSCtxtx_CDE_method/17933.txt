Donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers are widely used in high-performance organic opto-electronic devices. In this work, we develop a series of D–A type conjugated polymers, P-nT (n = 1–5), based on alternating double B←N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit and oligothiophene units of various length. In P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T, the D units are thiophene, bi-thiophene, tri-thiophene, tetra-thiophene and penta-thiophene, respectively. We find that the opto-electronic properties and thin film morphologies of the polymers can be substantially changed by the length of the oligothiophene units. From P-1T to P-5T, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers gradually upshift because of the electron-donating nature of oligothiophene units. P-1T, P-2T and P-3T can be used as electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells, while P-4T and P-5T can work as electron donors in fullerene-based organic solar cells. In addition, with the increasing length of the oligothiophene units, the crystallinity of the polymers increased. P-1T and P-2T are amorphous, while P-3T, P-4T and P-5T show semicrystalline property in solid state. All-polymer solar cell with P-3T as the electron acceptor exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.52% and the fullerene-based organic solar cells with P-5T as the electron donor exhibits a PCE of 5.79%. These results provide a molecular design guideline to rationally tune optical, electronic and crystalline properties of D–A type conjugated polymers.

As electronic materials, conjugated polymers have gained intensive attention for applications in display, lighting, solar energy conversion, sensing and circuits. Device performance of conjugated polymers have reached significant milestones, such as ∼15% solar power conversion efficiency, ∼50 lm W−1 light emission efficiency, ∼5 cm2 V−1 s−1 electron/hole mobilities. The most successful strategy for designing high-performance conjugated polymers is donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymerization. Opto-electronic properties of D–A type polymers can be modulated easily by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating unit (D) to the electron-accepting unit (A). Based on this strategy, numerous D–A combinations have been developed to tune the energy levels and the bandgaps, and device performance of electronic materials have been improved. Compared to a large number of D units, only a few A units have been developed. The majority of the A units have been used to design p-type polymer semiconductors or polymer electron donors, such as isoindigo (IID), benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT), naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT), benzotriazole (TAZ), benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD), pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP), thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT), bithiophene diimide (BTI),etc. A few A units can be used to develop n-type polymer semiconductors or polymer electron acceptors, such as naphthalene diimide (NDI), perylene diimide (PDI), dicyano-substituted benzothiadiazole (DCNBT), fluorinated isoindigo (F-IID), naphthodithiophenediimides (NDTI), triperylene hexaimides (TPH),etc. However, very few A units can work well in both polymer electron donors and polymer electron acceptors.

While most of these A units are based on electron-withdrawing amide, imide or thiadiazole structures, in 2016, our group has reported a new kind of A units based on boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B←N), double B←N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit. D–A type polymers based on BNBP unit can be used as electron acceptors in high-performance organic photovoltaic devices. Their all-polymer solar cell (all-PSC) devices show power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% and their all-polymer indoor photovoltaic devices exhibit PCE of 27%. An important feature of BNBP-based D–A type conjugated polymers is their delocalized lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), which lead to tunable LUMO energy levels (ELUMO). The tunable ELUMO indicates the possibility to develop polymer electron donors based on BNBP unit with careful molecular design.
In this manuscript, we select BNBP as the A unit and oligothiophene of various length as the D unit to design a series of D–A type alternating copolymers. We elucidate how the length of the oligothiophene units dramatically affect the opto-electronic properties, thin film morphology, and organic solar cell device behaviors of the resulting polymers. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of the five polymers, (P-nT, n = 1–5). In P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T, the D units are thiophene, bi-thiophene, tri-thiophene, tetra-thiophene and penta-thiophene, respectively. We have introduced two fluorine substituents to each oligothiophene units for enhanced OPV device performance. With the increasing length of oligothiophene units, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (EHOMO) and ELUMO of the five polymers gradually increase. As the result, while P-1T, P-2T and P-3T work well as polymer electron acceptor in all-PSCs, P-4T and P-5T works well as polymer electron donors in OSCs. Moreover, while P-1T and P-2T are amorphous in solid state, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T are semicrystalline in thin film. These results provide guidelines for molecular design of D–A type conjugated polymers with finely tuned energy levels and crystallinity for improved opto-electronic device performance.

The synthetic routes and synthesis procedures of P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T are shown in the ESI. P-1T, P-2T and P-3T were synthesized by Stille-polymerization of the dibromo monomer of BNBP and the di-tin monomers of fluorinated thiophene (3), di-thiophene (4) and tri-thiophene (5), respectively. P-4T and P-5T was were synthesized by the same polymerization method of the key dibromo monomer 7 and the di-tin monomers 4 and 5, respectively. The monomer 7 was prepared in two steps of Stille coupling reaction and bromination reaction starting from BNBP. Two extra alkyl chains are introduced to thiophene units of the monomer 7 in order to ensure solubility of the polymers P-4T and P-5T. The chemical structures of the monomers and polymers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and elemental analysis (Fig. S14–S22). According to gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the five polymers are in the range of 29.4–49.4 kg mol−1 and the polydispersity index (PDI) are in the range of 1.91–2.46. The similar Mn and PDI of these polymers exclude the influence of molecular weight. All the polymers are well soluble in organic solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB), toluene, chloroform (CF) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S4), all of these polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss of over 340 °C.


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed to investigate the influence of the length of oligothiophene units on the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals of the five polymers. To simplify the DFT calculations, we used methyl groups to replace the long alkyl chains in the model compounds. The optimized molecular geometries of the model compounds of the five polymers are shown in Fig. S2. The oligothiophene units show a planar structure with small dihedral angle between two adjacent thiophene rings. The presence of F⋯S interactions are beneficial to lock the planar conformation of the oligothiophene units. In contrast, the connection between the adjacent thiophene unit and BNBP unit are twisted with the dihedral angle of over 20°. Among the five polymers, P-1T, P-3T and P-5T exhibit wavy backbone configuration while P-2T and P-4T show pseudo-straight backbone configuration.

The frontier molecular orbitals of the model molecules are shown in Fig. 2. For all the five polymers, both the HOMOs and LUMOs are well delocalized on the D units and A units. Therefore, the oligothiophene D units can affect both the LUMO energy levels and the HOMO energy levels of the polymers. Due to the electron-donating nature of thiophene units, as the number of thiophene rings increases in the D units, both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels are predicted to increase. As shown in Fig. S3, along with the increase of the thiophene units from 1 to 5, the calculated EHOMO/ELUMO gradually increase.
Besides the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals, the various length of oligothiophene units in the polymers affect the backbone stiffness or flexibility, which can directly impact the ordered stacking of polymer chains in solid state, e.g. crystallization. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal the influence of length of the oligothiophene units on polymer backbone flexibility. The flexibility of polymer backbones can be quantitatively described by the persistence length (lp). The smaller lp, the larger flexibility. As these polymers strongly absorb visible light and form aggregates in solution, we are not able to experimentally measure their lp. Instead, we have carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the dihedral potential method to estimate the lp of the polymers. The detailed computational procedures of lp calculations are provided in the ESI. The lp values of the five polymers are listed in Table 2 and compared in Fig. 3. The lp of P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T are 8.6 nm, 4.1 nm, 3.9 nm, 2.7 nm and 2.5 nm, respectively. With increased length of the oligothiophene units, the lp of the polymers decrease, indicating improved backbone flexibility.

In order to estimate the energy levels of these polymers, we measured the thin films by the cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 4a, the cyclic voltammograms of the polymers exhibit obvious reduction waves and oxidation waves. The EHOMO/ELUMO of the polymers are estimated from the onset oxidation waves and the onset reduction waves. The EHOMO/ELUMO are −5.86 eV/−3.75 eV for P-1T, −5.93 eV/−3.54 eV for P-2T, −5.75 eV/−3.48 eV for P-3T, −5.55 eV/−3.33 eV for P-4T and −5.45 eV/−3.11 eV for P-5T, respectively. These energy levels of the polymers are compared in Fig. 4b, as the length of the oligothiophene units increases, the EHOMO and ELUMO of the five polymers both increase, which are attributed to the electron-donating nature of thiophene units. Moreover, the delocalization of the HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals in the polymers contribute to the rise of energy levels.


Fig. 4b also presents the energy level alignment for the five polymers P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T, a typical polymer electron donor, poly[4,8-bis(5-(dodecylthio)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole] (J61) and an electron acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Among the five polymers, P-1T, P-2T and P-3T exhibit low-lying EHOMO/ELUMO. They can work as electron acceptors to match with J61 in OSCs. P-4T and P-5T may not be able to work as electron acceptors because their ELUMO are too high. Conversely, they can work as electron donors to match PC71BM.
The absorption spectra of P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T in chlorobenzene solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 5 and the characteristics are listed in Table 1. In solution, all the five polymers exhibit high extinction coefficients with the maximum absorption in the wavelength range of 550–650 nm, suggesting strong sunlight harvesting capability. From in solution to in thin film, P-1T and P-2T display small redshift of absorption maxima by 21 nm and 9 nm, respectively. By contrast, P-4T and P-5T show large redshift of absorption maxima by 68 nm and 72 nm, respectively. The large redshift of P-4T and P-5T are mainly attributed to the more planar conformation of the polymer backbones in thin film than in solution. These results indicate that the polymer backbones of P-1T/P-2T are more rigid than those of P-4T/P-5T, which are consistent with the estimated lp results. According to the onset absorption wavelength, the optical band gap (Eoptg) of P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T are estimated to be 1.94 eV, 1.90 eV, 1.89 eV, 1.83 eV and 1.74 eV, respectively.

The crystallinity of these polymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results are shown in Fig. 6 and the characteristics are listed Table 2. P-1T and P-2T show no phase transition in the wide range from 20 °C to 330 °C, suggesting that the two polymers are amorphous in solid state. P-3T, P-4T and P-5T show distinct melting peaks (Tm = 320 °C for P-3T, Tm = 261 °C for P-4T, Tm = 282 °C for P-5T) and crystallization peaks (Tc = 299 °C for P-3T, Tc = 235 °C for P-4T, Tc = 259 °C for P-5T) during the heating process and the cooling process, respectively, indicating semi-crystalline nature. Compared with P-3T, P-4T and P-5T exhibit lower crystallization temperatures (Tc) and melting temperatures (Tm) due to the extra alkyl side chains on the oligothiophene units. In addition, the crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) of P-3T, P-4T and P-5T are 12.7 J g−1, 13.2 J g−1 and 15.9 J g−1, respectively. These results suggest that crystallinity of the polymers increased with the increasing of the number of thiophene rings.

We estimate the molecular stacking of the thin films of the five polymers using 2-dimensional grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). The results are shown in Fig. 7 and the characteristics are listed in Table S1. P-1T displays negligible (010) π–π stacking diffraction peaks and P-2T only show wide (010) diffraction peaks in the in-plane direction, suggesting very poor stacking of P-1T and P-2T. In comparison, the 2D-GIWAXS patterns of P-3T, P-4T and P-5T all exhibit strong (010) peaks in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Besides the (100) peaks, the (200) peaks can be obviously observed for P-4T and P-5T. These results confirm the semi-crystallinity nature of P-3T, P-4T and P-5T. Using the coherence length (CL) of the (010) peaks in the out-of-plane direction, we analyze the crystalline domain size of the five thin films. As listed in Table 2, the CL values calculated with the Scherrer's equation gradually increases from 18 Å of P-2T to 35 Å of P-5T. Concomitantly, the π–π stacking distance gradually decreases from 3.95 Å of P-2T to 3.72 Å of P-5T. These results support that the crystallinity of the polymers increased with the increasing length of the oligothiophene unit.
From the above results, we can know that the crystallinity of the polymers increase as the number of thiophene increase. For conjugated polymer, segments of polymer chains must change their conformations to form ordered stacking for crystallization. The more flexible the conjugated polymer backbone, the easier for the segments to adapt the conformations, the higher crystallinity of conjugated polymers in solid state. P-1T and P-2T have large lp values and possess stiff backbones, which impede crystallization of the polymers. P-3T, P-4T and P-5T with the long oligothiophene units and small lp values have flexible backbones. Therefore, they are able to crystallize at high temperature. These results suggest that flexible polymer backbone is beneficial for ordered molecular stacking and crystallinity.

The charge carrier mobilities of the five polymers are measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method based on the electron-only device with the device structure of ITO/PEIE/polymer/Ca/Al. As shown in Fig. S5, the electron mobilities (μe) of P-T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T films are estimated to be 9.17 × 10−5, 2.90 × 10−4, 7.70 × 10−4, 2.74 × 10−5 and 9.47 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. From P-T, P-2T to P-3T, the electron mobilities are gradually increased, which may be assigned to the enhanced crystallinity and improved molecular ordering. However, the electron mobilities of P-4T and P-5T are low, which are mainly due to the noneffective electron injection from the electrode caused by the high LUMO energy levels of P-4T and P-5T. As shown in Fig. S6, the hole mobilities (μh) of the polymers were measured. The hole mobilities are increased with the increasing length of the oligothiophene unit, indicating the enhanced hole transport ability.


As electron acceptors, the polymers based on BNBP unit exhibit high performance in organic photovoltaic devices. In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the five polymers as electron acceptors, we select a commercially available polymer J61 (Fig. S8b) as the polymer electron donor to blend with the five polymers to fabricate all-PSCs. The device structure is indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/J61:P-nT (n = 1–5)/Ca/Al (Fig. S8a). The active layers of J61:P-nT (n = 1–5) are prepared by spin-coating with the blend solution in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the all-PSC devices are shown in Fig. 8a and b. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. From P-1T, P-2T to P-3T, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices all increase. The increased VOC are ascribed to the upshifted ELUMO of the polymer acceptors. The improved JSC and FF are may due to the improved electron mobility of the polymer acceptors and the optimal blend morphology. Among the five polymers, P-3T as electron acceptor exhibits the highest PCE of 6.52% with a VOC of 1.22 V, a JSC of 11.15 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.48. The EQE spectrum of this device shows the maximum EQE value of 0.62 at the wavelength of 570 nm. The better all-PSC device performance of P-3T than P-T and P-2T indicate the great impact of polymer crystallinity on photovoltaic device performance. P-4T-based and P-5T-based devices both exhibit inferior PCE values. This is due to the high ELUMO of P-4T and P-5T, which cannot provide adequate driving force for the photo-induced charge separation.

In order to investigate the reason for the different device performance of the five polymer acceptors, we measured the active layer morphology of the blend films by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. S12 presents the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images of the five blend films. For J61:P-1T and J61:P-2T blend films, the TEM images seem to be uniform without distinct white and dark domains, the AFM height images reveal smooth surface. These results suggest that J61 and P-1T/P-2T are well intermixed in the blend films. In comparison, the TEM images of J61:P-3T, J61:P-4T and J61:P-5T show obvious phase separation with some distinguishable dark fiberous structures. As shown in the AFM height images, the surfaces of J61:P-3T, J61:P-4T and J61:P-5T blends are rougher than those of the J61:P-1T and J61:P-2T blends. It is evident that the polymer acceptors crystallize during the film-forming process and lead to obvious phase separation for the J61:P-3T, J61:P-4T and J61:P-5T blend films. These results agree well with the amorphous feature of P-1T and P-2T and the semi-crystalline feature of P-3T, P-4T and P-5T. As shown in Fig. S13, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency of the P-1T, P-2T, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T in the blends are 97.3%, 76.4%, 91.9%, 45.1% and 48.0%, respectively. Compared with J61:P-4T and J61:P-5T, the J61:P-1T, J61:P-2T and J61:P-3T blends exhibit higher PL quenching efficiency, indicating the effective charge transfer in these blends. Notably, J61:P-3T blend film exhibits optimal phase separation morphology with suitable phase-separated domains, which are beneficial for the charge transport and collection, and consequently improved device performance.
The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of these blend films are measured using the SCLC method with the hole-only device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and the electron-only device structure of ITO/PEIE/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. The J–V curves and the SCLC fittings are shown in Fig. S7. The μh/μe are estimated to be 3.10 × 10−4/9.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:P-1T blend, 6.30 × 10−4/2.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:P-2T blend, 6.92 × 10−4/4.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:P-3T blend, 1.68 × 10−4/2.63 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:P-4T blend and 1.05 × 10−4/1.12 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J61:P-5T blend, respectively. The high and balanced charge transport of J61:P-3T blend contributes to the improved device performance.
The high energy levels of P-4T and P-5T imply that they can be used as polymer electron donors. We choose PC71BM as the electron acceptor to blend with P-4T or P-5T as the polymer donor and to fabricate OSC device. The device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P-4T or P-5T:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The J–V and EQE curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 9. The P-4T-based device shows a PCE of 0.77%, with a VOC of 0.77 V, a JSC of 2.07 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.48. The PCE of P-5T:PC71BM blend is 5.79% with a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 11.62 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.62. The decent PSC device performance of P-5T indicate that BNBP unit can be used to design polymer electron donors with high photovoltaic efficiency.

In conclusion, we have developed a series of alternating D–A type conjugated polymers based on BNBP unit and oligothiophene units of various length. As the length of oligothiophene units increase, the polymers exhibit gradually increased EHOMO/ELUMO and improved crystallinity in thin film. As the result, while P-1T, P-2T and P-3T work well as polymer electron acceptors, P-5T is suitable to be used as polymer electron donor in OSCs. P-1T and P-2T are amorphous in solid state. In contrast, P-3T, P-4T and P-5T are semicrystalline in thin film. Owing to the low EHOMO/ELUMO and semicrystalline property, P-3T as an electron acceptor shows the best performance in all-PSC devices. This work discloses the correlation between the chemical structure, opto-electronic properties, thin film morphology and device performance of BNBP-based polymers. These knowledge can be adopted to design high-performance D–A type conjugated polymers for opto-electronic device applications.
