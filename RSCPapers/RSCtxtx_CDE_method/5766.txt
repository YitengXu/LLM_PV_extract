Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have celebrated a decade of investigation as a promising photovoltaic technology. However, they contain lead, so inorganic lead-free PSCs can be designed as green and clean energy sources. To overcome the current obstacles in lead-free PSCs, the stability and performance gap should be minimized. The drift-diffusion simulation model is a conducive way to understand the working mechanism in a thin-film solar cell. Here we adopted a computational approach to design and investigate the performance of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 as a light harvester. We optimize the thickness of the perovskite, for its use in an inverted planar structure (FTO/PCBM/CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au). Furthermore, cerium oxide (CeOx) and PTAA are used as alternative electron and hole transport layers, respectively. We studied the effect of trap density in the bulk CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 and its impact on performance, recombination rate, and diffusion length. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) showed a significant improvement and the correlation with the trap density at the interface layers is established. We noted that the defect density at the perovskite/hole selective layer interface has a profound impact on the performance of lead-free PSCs as compared to the electron selective layer/perovskite interface. After optimizing defect parameters, the lead-free PSC can deliver a PCE of 24.20%, with Voc = 1170 mV, Jsc = 25.80 mA cm−2, and FF = 80.33%. Our findings provide access guidelines and pave the way for lead-free PSCs based on the Sn–Ge combination to approach their limit.

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have established themselves as a “rising star” in thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies. Pb-based PSCs are attracting enormous attention due to their unparalleled electro-optical properties that have led to record performance in thin-film PVs. However, the toxicity of lead (Pb) is considered as an impermeable barrier to its success. According to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, an effective perovskite absorber layer should have a value between 0.8 and 1.0. Tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge) are ideally suited to replace Pb to form a perovskite structure and display higher optical absorption coefficients as compared to Pb. However, due to the low chemical stability of Sn2+ and Ge2+, fewer studies have been reported. Nevertheless, due to the low optical band gaps and high charge carrier mobility, Sn-based perovskites are the preferred choice of the PSC research community. Organic–inorganic Sn-based PSCs were developed, followed by numerous efforts to improve the performance of Sn-based PSCs. However, thermal durability at high temperature, due to the volatile nature of organic elements, is a challenge for organic–inorganic Sn-based PSCs. On the other hand, all-inorganic CsBI3 is one of the promising materials for Sn-based PSCs, where the B site is either Sn or Ge. Upon employing Sn, binary structures, β-γ-CsSnI3, a black orthorhombic phase, and the yellow γ-CsSnI3 phase, are formed which could be suitable for solar application. β-γ-CsSnI3 exhibits a bandgap of ∼1.3 eV, which is close to the ideal value (1.34 eV). Besides, CsSnI3 offers low toxicity and high thermal (450 °C) stability. CsSnI3 can be easily converted to the yellow orthorhombic phase (Pnma, γ) at room temperature upon exposure to air, oxygen, or water vapor. Sn-based perovskite undergoes self-doping through oxidation (Sn2+ to Sn4+), which in turn increases the hole density and leads to a short circuit or low-performance PCE, limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 4.81%. The use of additives such as SnF2, SnCl2, and excess SnI2 can retard the generation of tin vacancies by neutralizing the traps. Moreover, organic additives were also applied, such as piperazine or hydroxybenzene sulfonic acids, to improve the PCE and stability. The competitive performance of the tin–germanium alloy (CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3), with an optical band gap of 1.5 eV, gave a PCE of 7.11% with a stability of over 500 h under continuous operation. The fabrication of the PSC was based on the solid-state reaction between mixed powder precursor CsI:SnI2:GeI2 carried out in evacuated Pyrex tubes with PCBM and Spiro-OMeTAD as the electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL), respectively. The competitive results demonstrated a new pathway to fabricate lead-free PSCs and the impact of interface passivation on the performance of PSCs. Despite such advancement, the performance remains lower as compared to the theoretical values. The stability of PCBM and Spiro-OMeTAD is still unclear. As an alternative, cerium oxide (CeOx) can be applied as an ETL and can be processed at low temperature (<150 °C); it shows a wide bandgap, high thermal and chemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. Polytriarylamine (PTAA) is a promising HTL to fabricate efficient PSCs. We can assume that the low performance reported with CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 based PSCs could be related to the nature of the selective layer and the high recombination in the bulk perovskite or at the interfacial layers. Zhenyi et al. demonstrated the distribution and impact of trap densities in the bulk perovskite layer and its interfaces on the performance of inverted PSCs using drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) and drift-diffusion simulation. The priority of reducing the trap-assisted density either at the perovskite/HTL or the ETL/perovskite interfaces should be clarified as well. The non-radiative recombination is dominant in PSCs, occurring either at the grain boundaries or perovskite/HTL and ETL/perovskite interfaces and it is governed by trap-assisted recombination. A recent report suggests that the synergetic problems of Sn–Ge need to be solved by finding an effective approach to improve the voltage and PV properties. Thus, charge selective materials, the trap density in the bulk of the perovskite, and its interfaces need to be engineered to boost the performance of Sn–Ge-based PSCs. The macroscopic simulation such as the drift diffusion model can be an effective approach to overcome this challenge without sacrificing laboratory consumables, manpower, and time to cut down the cost.

Herein, to figure out the performance limit of using CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 as an absorber layer, we computed (Fig. 1) the n-i-p structure, i.e. FTO/PCBM/CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. By employing the Solar Capacitor Simulator (SCAPS), the first simulation model was compared to the experimental studies reported. We optimized the thickness of the absorber layer by following the performance improvement. Additionally, we employed CeOx and PTAA as the ETL and HTL as charge selective layers. Subsequently, the effects of defect density (Nt) in the absorber layer and ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL were studied.

The simulations were performed using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator SCAPS 3.3.07 software based on the Poisson equation and the continuity equations for electrons and holes.

The adopted device architecture for simulated planar PSCs was FTO/PCBM/interface layer 1(IL1)/CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3/interface layer 2 (IL2)/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Firstly, the defect density (Nt) of the absorber layer, which measures the quality of the crystal, is set to be 1 × 1016 cm−3 and is considered neutral, and the capture cross-section of electrons and holes is 1 × 10−14 cm2. The electron and hole thermal velocity is 107 cm s−1. Taking into account interface recombination, two ultra-thin layers at ETM/absorber (IL1) and absorber/HTM (IL2) with an initial defect density of 1 × 1018 cm−3 were inserted. The other parameters for each layer are shown in Table 1, where NA and ND denote acceptor and donor densities, εr is relative permittivity, χ is electron affinity, Eg is the bandgap energy, μn and μp are the mobilities of electrons and holes, and Nt is defect density. The pre-factor Aα is set to 105 to obtain the absorption coefficient (α) by α = Aα(hνEg)1/2. Metallic gold (Au) is used as the back contact and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as the front contact. The simulations were carried out at AM 1.5G illumination.

The performance of our first model is close to the reported experimental values. We adopted our first model by selecting simulation inputs from the experimental literature before further optimization. The thickness of the perovskite layer was kept at 200 nm, and was deduced from the experimental report suggesting the best performance. Arguably, improving this value will be the first route to enhance the absorption and increase the external quantum efficiency (EQE). Another channel can be the source of recombination (R′), stemming from the mismatch energy level between the light harvester and charge selective layers, which can be described as

R′ = CBO + VBO
(4)
CBO is the conduction band offset between the ETL and the perovskite and VBO is the valence band offset between the perovskite and the HTL. The other parameter that can affect the performance of the PSC is known as the total recombination rate (R′′) related to the trap density and is given by
(5)
where
Rb is the band-to-band recombination rate, and RSRH is the Shockley–Read–Hall trap-assisted recombination. In this study, we considered all of the above-described sources of recombination to design highly efficient lead-free PSCs.


The figure of merit in a solar cell is derived by the parameters, namely the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). Hence, maximizing the value of each parameter is key to achieving high efficiency. The absorber layer thickness significantly influences the microstructure and electro-optical properties as well as the rate of generation and separation of free charges. The best efficiency reported using CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 displays a thickness of 200 nm, we adapted the value to compute our first model. We investigated the effect of absorber layer thickness on the PV parameters to unravel the optimum value.


Fig. 2 illustrates the computed results for the influence of absorber layer thickness (100–900 nm) on PV parameters and external quantum efficiency. The thickness increase in CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 led to an enhancement in PV parameters and the peak value suggests optimized thickness. We noted an increase in VOC with an increase in the thickness up to 400 nm. The VOC can be presented by eqn (6) where n is the diode ideality factor, IO is dark saturation current, IL is light-generated current, and  is thermal voltage:
(6)
A thicker absorber layer increases the carrier's recombination, therefor IO increases more than IL. After a specific value as suggested above, further light absorption and excess carrier concentration enhance the current density Jsc over the range of absorber layer thickness. The maximum PCE attained at 500 nm is 13.57%; arguably, it can be considered as an optimum thickness to fabricate efficient PSCs as compared to the reported 200 nm. The drop in performance for thickness > 500 nm is due to the higher chances of recombination in the bulk of perovskites, and the impeded movement of free charges.

The energy level alignment between the interlayers as well as the stability of selective layers in the PSC architecture is key to minimizing the energy loss. Using CeOx as an ETL can be an effective path to improve the performance in lead-free PSCs. Firstly (Fig. 3a), by employing CeOx as an ETL the FF improved, which suggests a favorable interface. The CeOx possesses attractive optoelectronic properties and low-temperature processing will enhance the stability. The chemical instability and energy level mismatch of Spiro-OMeTAD is an additional challenge for lead-free PSC development. The VBO is a parameter to measure the energy level between the perovskite layer and HTL. We have demonstrated that reducing the VBO will help to improve the Voc in PSCs. Thus, we have employed PTAA (−5.25 eV) as an HTL; it has a deep energy level compared to the perovskite layer (−5.4 eV) in contrast with Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.11 eV) as shown (Fig. 3b).

Substitution of the Spiro-OMeTAD with PTAA will reduce the migration distance of holes toward the back contact; subsequently, performance enhancement can be achieved: PCE ∼ 15.01%, Voc = 847 mV, Jsc ∼ 25.71 mA cm−2, and FF ∼ 69.14%. To understand the influence of selective layers, a Nyquist plot (Fig. 3d) of different configurations was simulated. The arc at the low-frequency region is associated with the recombination resistance (Rrec); higher Rrec values indicate less recombination and efficient separation of free charges at the interfaces. Therefore, it is evident that moving from D1 to D3 PSCs showed less recombination at the interfaces and an enhancement in carrier concentration, suggesting the decisive role of CeOx and PTAA for performance enhancement in lead-free PSCs. However, the performance is far from the theoretical limit of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, and to unravel this ambiguity we focus on other recombination losses.

Apart from the selective layers of PSCs, the absorber layer's trap density is a key element to achieve high performance which measures the quality of the perovskite. The reported defect density for CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 is 1 × 1016 cm−3, which is high as compared to the value in Pb-based perovskites.

To understand the effect of this subtle parameter on the performance of lead-free PSCs and to elucidate the optimum value for CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, we studied the impact of defect density (Nt) of the perovskite layer on the performance. As illustrated (Fig. 4a–c), the Nt is varied from 1 × 1016 to 1 × 1010 cm−3, as the decrease in Nt leads to an increase in PV parameters exponentially up to 1 × 1013; afterward the performance improved gradually and attained maximum values at Nt = 1 × 1011 cm−3, thus yielding a PCE of ∼17.42%, with Voc = 890 mV, Jsc ∼ 25.75 mA cm−2, and FF ∼ 75.45%. We define the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination at the bulk perovskite using the following equation:
(7)
where
σn and σp are the capture cross-sections for electrons and holes, νth is thermal velocity, Nt is defect density, n and p are the concentrations of electrons and holes, ni is the intrinsic density, Ei is the intrinsic energy level, and Et is the energy level of the trap defect.

The drop in performance is due to increasing non-radiative recombination (Fig. 4b and d); to have the vice versa effect, the bulk perovskite layer should be neutralized from defect sites. Decreasing the Nt of the bulk perovskite layer (Fig. 4b and c) reduces the recombination rate by enhancing the lifetime of free charge carriers inside the PSC, thus increasing the probability of the collection of free charges at the bottom and front of the PSC. The diffusion length of electrons and holes (Fig. 4c) is calculated using the following equations:
(8)
(9)
(10)
where
L is the diffusion length, τn,p the charge carrier lifetime, and D is the diffusion coefficient. KB and μ represent Boltzmann's constant and charge carrier mobility, while q and T represent the magnitude of charge and temperature in Kelvin, respectively.

The ideality factor (n) is calculated (Fig. 4e) following eqn (6) as described in Section 3.1 according to the relationship between ln (light intensity) and Voc; from the slope , n showed values > 2 which indicates the dominant nature of both bulk SRH and interface recombination in the PSCs. With a reduction in the defect density, the n values started to approach 2 and saturated at Nt = 1 × 1012 cm−3 with n = 2.51. Furthermore, Fig. 4f illustrates the power law dependence between Jsc and light intensity (J ∝ Iα). Both the PSCs with high and reduced defect densities show similar slopes (α = 0.99) in a double-logarithmic scale, implying that the charge-collection efficiency is independent of light intensity.
To minimize the trap vacancy from the bulk perovskite layer, one approach is to use a doping mechanism with different elements; a combination of layered (2D) and 3D perovskites can be an alternative solution. To overcome the challenge of lead-free PSCs, it is paramount to find a suitable fabrication process as an alternative to spin coating processes, as the spin coating process has a high rate of producing pinholes in the presence of Sn4+ and Ge4+. Fabrication of lead-free perovskites of high quality is a demanding task. Based on the results, our PSC performance is saturated after Nt = 1 × 1011 cm−3; we ascribed this to the high trap density at the interfaces of the perovskite layer. To validate our hypothesis, we will highlight the effect of trap density at the ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL interfaces.

To understand the interface recombination, a modified Shockley–Read–Hall model that explains the effect of defect density is used:

(11)

RIL is the total interface recombination, where nIL and pIL are the electron and hole concentrations at the interfaces. The terms n and p are related to the emission rate from the defect energy state to the corresponding band edges (Ec and Ev) at the interfaces. Sn and Sp are the hole and electron interface recombination velocities which are related to the defect density (Nt), capture cross-sectional area of the trap for electrons as well as holes and the thermal velocity following eqn (11):

Sn,p = Ntσn,pνth
(12)
For highly doped selective layers, the interface recombination rate reduces to RIL = Sp.
Arguably, the interfaces are a source of instability and poor performance in the solar cells. Based on the above eqn (12), the capture cross-area of trap and the thermal velocity are constant the interface recombination is sensitive to the rate of the trap density. PSCs are fabricated with selective layers which increases the chances of forming defects at the interfaces. Therefore, the effect of defect density at the ETL/perovskite (IL1) and the perovskite/HTL (IL2) on the performance of lead-free PSCs was investigated, where the thermal velocity and trap capture cross-sectional area for electrons and holes are kept constant (Fig. 5).
Remarkably, we noted that defect density at the interfaces impacts the performance of PSCs, particularly the PCE, Voc, and FF. Reducing the defect density at both the interfaces leads to an enhancement in the PV parameters (Fig. 5). There is an increment in PCE from 17% to over 24% and similarly the Voc increases from 890 to 1170 mV, and the FF improves from 75 to over 80%, but with minute gains in the Jsc due to similar injection of free charges. The red area represents the highest values that can be attained for each PV parameter; thus, to achieve this value (Fig. 5), an arrangement of defect density at both interfaces is a prerequisite (Table 2). Additionally, we also noted that the defect density at the perovskite/HTL interface is sensitive to the performance and influences the PV properties; by keeping the NtIL2 = 1 × 1018 cm−3 and varying the NtIL1, we noticed that the performance remains constant and the blue area (low performance) dominates. In contrast, when we reduce the NtIL2, the effect of defect density at the ETL/perovskite is observed, conversely to the effect of defect density at the perovskite/HTL; reducing the NtIL2 even if the NtIL1 is high, the performance of the PSC is boosted from the blue area to the green (Fig. 5). This is supported by the hypothesis that the light first strikes through the perovskite/HTL, thus reducing the trap density at the front interface which could help the absorber layer to harvest maximum solar radiation by minimizing the recombination channels. Thus, designing high performance, a low value of NtIL2 is recommended. The defect density at the NtIL2 impacts the performance of the PSCs largely and can be an approach to catalyze the effect of defect density at the ETL/perovskite interface.

Experimentally, such defect density values at interfaces could be achieved by the passivation mechanism especially at the perovskite/HTL interface to suppress the defects. The interface interaction mechanism and with additives for the perovskite layer needs to be studied. The bulk and interfaces are essential to research, to push the performance of lead-free PSCs close to that of Pb-based PSCs. To reduce the recombination rate at interfaces, improving the mobility of free charge carriers of selective layers as well as the use of efficient passivating materials that can reduce the interface carrier density and surface recombination velocities is essential. Furthermore, efficient fabrication methods such as thermal co-evaporation, printing, or large-scale industrial technologies can help to control the defect density inside the perovskite layer. To benchmark this, we tabulated (Table 3) the recent progress in all-inorganic lead-free PSCs with our optimized results by reducing the different discussed recombination channels.

In summary, we presented a computational approach using solar cell capacitance simulator software to unravel the road map for performance enhancement in a lead-free perovskite solar cell based on CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3. We noted an optimized thickness of 500 nm in a configuration of FTO/PCBM/CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au to be the optimum value, while using CeOx and PTAA further enhances the performance as electron and hole selective layers, respectively. The optimized value of the trap density in the bulk of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 is found to be ∼1 × 1011 cm−3, derived from high-quality perovskites that can decrease the total recombination rate. We conclude that reducing the trap density at perovskite interfaces beyond 1 × 1014 cm−3 is key to boosting the performance of Sn–Ge-based PSCs. Furthermore, we observed that the benefit of interface passivation at the perovskite/hole selective interface is higher than that of the electron selective layer/perovskite. This in turn controls the performance improvements in lead-free PSCs based on CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3.
