A novel double cable donor–acceptor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) derivative (PCBM-Ph-P3HT) was successfully synthesized via a facile postpolymerization approach followed by a Steglich esterification reaction, which was doped in a P3HT:PCBM (PCBM = [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) blend solution so as to study its effect on the device performance of P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs). The successful attachment of PCBM as the side chain onto the P3HT backbone via a phenyl group is confirmed by both 1H NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopic studies. The fluorescence intensity of PCBM-Ph-P3HT in chlorobenzene shows ∼63% quenching of the fluorescence of P3HT, indicating a strong intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer between P3HT and PCBM moieties. PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into P3HT:PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios (1, 2 and 5 wt%) and the surface morphology of PCBM-Ph-P3HT-doped film was studied by AFM, indicating that PCBM-Ph-P3HT promotes the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT and PCBM components due to its amphiphilicity toward P3HT and PCBM like a “surfactant”. At the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt%, the P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC devices doped by PCBM-Ph-P3HT show an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE), with the maximum PCE being 3.40% which has ca. 12% enhancement compared to that of the reference P3HT:PCBM device. The enhancement of PCE is evidently attributed to the increase of short-circuit current (Jsc), and proposed enhancement mechanism is that the improvement on the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT and PCBM components upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping leads to the increase of the charge carrier mobility.

Conjugated polymers, especially polythiophenes, have been receiving much attention in the potential application in polymer solar cells (PSCs) which show a bright prospect for inexpensive solar energy conversion. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure comprising an interpenetrating network of a conjugated polymer donor such as poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and a soluble fullerene acceptor which is typically [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the photoactive layer has been demonstrated to be the most popular architecture of PSCs reported so far, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ-PSCs based on solution-processable blends of P3HT and PCBM has reached up to 5%. One of the main problems limiting the device performance of BHJ-PSCs is that usually the conjugated polymer donor and fullerene acceptor species which are blended physically tend to undergo uncontrolled macrophase separation and thus may hinder the photoinduced charge separation and the charge transportation in the composite film. Two major strategies have been taken towards increasing the control of morphology of conjugated polymer donor/fullerene acceptor blends. One is to integrate the donor and acceptor moieties in the same main chain via a π-linking bridge to form donor–π–acceptor double cable conjugated polymers, which help to promote the homogeneous dispersion of the donor/acceptor domains and thus the interface between donor and acceptor counterparts could be improved and even maximized. Another effort has been devoted to use diblock copolymers with two different blocks of conjugated polymers and fullerene as a compatibilizer reducing the interfacial tension between donor and acceptor and consequently decreasing the phase sizes of the components. The latter approach was also reported to be useful for improving the long-term thermal stability of the BHJ-PSC devices. Noteworthy, for both strategies the intramolecular hybrids of donor/acceptor need to be constructed, in which fullerenes are attached to the conjugated polymers either as pendants in the side-chain or as terminal groups. For the former case a much higher substitution ratio of the fullerene moiety can be attained which appears important to tune the electronic and physical properties of the pristine conjugated polymers, hence numerous reports involve the synthesis of donor–π–acceptor double cable conjugated polymers bearing a fullerene pendant.

P3HT and PCBM are the most commonly used donor and acceptor materials in BHJ-PSCs, which may however suffer from considerable phase separation due to their immiscibility. To overcome such a problem, several different PCBM-P3HT intramolecular hybrids were constructed in a few reports. Li et al. synthesized a C60-substituted double cable polythiophene in which C60 was attached to the polythiophene backbone via an alkylphenylene linkage and in that way the C60 pendant mimics the PCBM structure, affording a PCE of 0.52% which is the highest value for the BHJ-PSCs based on the double cable polymers. Holdcroft et al. synthesized P3HT-PCBM donor–acceptor graft copolymers through cycloaddition of PCBM onto an azido substituted chloromethylstyrene-stat-styrene side chain grown on the thiophene backbone, and found that the use of PCBM improved the solubility of the fullerene-grafted copolymers and minimized their aggregation in solution. Wudl et al. synthesized the “donor–acceptor rod–coil” diblock copolymers (P3HT-b-P(SxAy)-C60) by a straightforward synthetic strategy of living polymerization and subsequent cycloaddition, which was added to the P3HT:PCBM layer resulting in about 35% increase in PCE. A similar diblock copolymer of P3HT and PCBM (P3HT-b-C60) was also reported by Jo et al. exhibiting a complete quenching of photoluminescence of P3HT. On the other hand, PCBM end-capped P3HT was also reported by two groups. Jo et al. synthesized a PCBM end-capped P3HT (P3HT-C60) via a Grignard metathesis polymerization method followed by directly linking PCBM to the chain end of P3HT via a Steglich esterification, and used it as a compatibilizer for a P3HT/PCBM composite for the purpose of controlling the morphology of the P3HT/PCBM composite film, and thus improving the long-term thermal stability of solar cell performance. Alternatively, Wudl et al. synthesized a similar PCBM-P3HT dyad through a Steglich reaction of P3HT-Ph-OH with carboxylated PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid, PCBA), which serves as a compatibilizer in P3HT/PCBM BHJ-PSCs and as a “surfactant” to enhance the solubility of fullerenes in poor solvents. Obviously, the reported synthetic methods of P3HT-PCBM donor–acceptor diblock copolymers typically require living polymerization and/or complicated design of the bridging groups, whereas PCBM end-capped P3HT was synthesized via much simpler methods involving the Steglich esterification reaction.
In this paper, we report the facile synthesis of a novel double cable donor–acceptor P3HT derivative (PCBM-Ph-P3HT), in which the PCBM moiety as the side chain is closely linked to the thiophene unit via a phenyl group. In the first two steps hydroxyl-functionalized P3HT is synthesized via postpolymerization following our recent success on the synthesis of a series of soluble donor–π–acceptor double cable P3HT bearing C60 pendant with tunable donor/acceptor ratio and a pyrene-functionalized P3HT derivative, and the last step involves a Steglich esterification reaction popularly employed in the synthesis of PCBM end-capped P3HT, which simplified significantly the synthesis to merely three steps. The polymeric structure and electronic properties of the synthesized PCBM-Ph-P3HT have been investigated by 1H NMR, UV-Vis, and fluorescence spectroscopies. The effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT doped in the P3HT:PCBM blend solution on both the surface morphology of P3HT:PCBM film and device performance of P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSCs is addressed.

All solvents employed (HPLC grade) and other reagents were commercially available, and used without further purification. N-Bromosuccinimide, 4-(hydroxymethyl)-phenylboronic acid, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4), 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. P3HT was purchased from Fusol Material, Ltd. (regioregular, Mn = 40872, Mw/Mn = 2.08).


Column chromatography (CC): SiO2 (200–300 mesh). UV-Vis spectra were measured on a UV-3600 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) using a quartz cell with 10 mm path length and 1 nm resolution. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 NMR instrument using tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. Fluorescence spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were taken using a Nanoscope III (Digital Instruments, USA) operating in both height and phase modes.


The synthetic route of PCBM-Ph-P3HT is shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedures are as follows:


The detailed syntheses of Br-P3HT and HO-Ph-P3HT with different substitution ratios were reported in our previous papers. In brief, Br-P3HT with about 3% bromine substitution was prepared by carefully controlling the quantity of reactants of P3HT and N-bromosuccinimide (see step (i) of Scheme 1). N-Bromosuccinimide (9.5 mg, 0.053 mmol) was added to a flask containing P3HT (300 mg, 1.81 mmol) in chloroform (20 mL). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 h and heated at 50 °C for 1 h and then poured into a saturated NaHCO3 solution (100 mL). The organic layer was washed with water three times and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Precipitation into methanol gave a black solid (86.4 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 6.99 (g, broad, 0.95H), 2.80 (f1, broad, 1.76H), 2.58 (f2, broad, 0.18H), 1.71 (e, broad, 1.89H), 1.39 (b, c, d, broad, 6.06H), 0.96 (a, broad, 3.00H).


Br-P3HT (300 mg, 0.053 mmol Br) and 4-(hydroxymethyl) phenyl-boronic acid (20 mg, 0.132 mmol) were mixed in THF (20 mL) in a 100 mL Schlenk flask under nitrogen. After Br-P3HT was dissolved completely, 2 M Na2CO3 solution (0.99 mL, 1.98 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (40 mg, 0.035 mmol) were added. The mixture was then heated to 80 °C for 48 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform and washed with water three to five times to remove the excess boronic acid. The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, and the polymer was poured into methanol to precipitate. After purification with methanol using a Soxhlet extractor, the polymer was dissolved in chloroform and passed through a silica gel column using chloroform as an eluent to remove the trace catalyst. The as-prepared polymer HO-Ph-P3HT (86 mg) was again precipitated in the methanol and dried under vacuum. 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.32 (h, triplet, 0.05H), 7.23 (i, triplet, 0.05H), 6.98 (g, broad, 0.93H), 4.71 (j, doublet, 0.06H), 2.80 (f1, m, broad, 1.78H), 2.58 (f2, broad, 0.18H), 1.70 (e, broad, 1.88H), 1.34 (b, c, d, broad, 6.37H), 0.91 (a, broad, 3.00H).


HO-Ph-P3HT (70 mg, 0.013 mmol –OH) and PCBA (7.67 mg, 0.0086 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL of CH2Cl2. The mixture was stirred for 10 min at 0 °C (ice/water bath) under N2 atmosphere. Then, 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (40 mg, 0.194 mmol) and 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (20 mg, 0.164 mmol) in 2 mL of CH2Cl2 were added, and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min at 0 °C. The cooling bath was then removed, and the solution was allowed to warm to room temperature. After being stirred for three days under N2, the reaction mixture was washed with water (4–30 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated (26 mg). 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.93–7.62 (n, multiplet, 0.20H), 7.56 (h, multiplet, 0.07H), 7.44 (i, multiplet, 0.06H), 6.98 (g, multiplet, 0.90H), 5.16 (j, multiplet, 0.06H), 2.92 (k, doublet, 0.09H), 2.80 (f1, broad, 1.48H), 2.65 (m, broad, 0.12H), 2.59 (f2, doublet, 0.18H), 2.20 (l, broad, 0.07H), 1.70 (e, doublet, 1.78H), 1.35 (b, c, d, broad, 6.26H), 0.85 (a, broad, 3.00H).


Our detailed fabrication procedure of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC devices has been reported recently. In brief, the ITO-coated glass substrate (8 Ω □−1, purchased from Shenzhen Nan Bo Group, China) was first cleaned with detergent, then ultrasonicated in acetone and isopropanol, and subsequently dried in an oven overnight. A thin film (∼45 nm thick) of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate and then annealed at 120 °C for 30 min. The P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8 w/w) blend was dissolved in chlorobenzene by stirring at 40 °C until all the materials dissolved, and PCBM-Ph-P3HT was added into the blend solution in a certain weight ratio which was variable from 0.009:1:0.8 to 0.036:1:0.8 (PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM), corresponding to the doping ratio of PCBM-Ph-P3HT ranging from 0.5% to 2% (wt%) to P3HT:PCBM blend (see Table 1). Prior to spin-coating, the PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM blend solution was ultrasonicated for 30 seconds to ensure thorough mixing, which was then spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer affording a thin film (∼80 nm thick) of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM active layer. All of the solution processing and film preparation were carried out in air atmosphere. The device was then transferred into a vacuum chamber (∼10−5 Torr), and an Al electrode (∼100 nm thick) was deposited on the top of the active layer through a shadow mask to define the active area of the devices (2 × 5 mm2). Finally, thermal annealing was carried out at 150 °C for 10 min on a digital hot plate under a nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box.

PCE was measured under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a standard xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA), for which the illumination intensity was calibrated by a monocrystalline silicon reference cell (Oriel P/N 91150V, with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter. All the measurements were carried out in air atmosphere and a mask with well-defined area size of 10.0 mm2 was attached onto the cell to define the effective area so as to ensure the accurate measurement.

The postpolymerization approach has been extensively used to functionalize polythiophenes including P3HT and has been demonstrated to simplify considerably the synthetic procedures for the derivatized polymers with versatile functional groups. Synthesis of P3HT-PCBM donor–acceptor diblock copolymers typically require living polymerization and/or complicated design of the bridging groups. Applying the postpolymerization approach, Holdcroft et al. synthesized a nitroxide-functionalized P3HT macroinitiator as the precursor of chloromethylstyrene-stat-styrene-substituted P3HT, affording P3HT-PCBM donor–acceptor graft copolymers. Frisbie and coworkers synthesized C60-end-functionalized P3HT (C60-P3HT-C60) by postpolymerization functionalization where both ends of the P3HT chains were terminated with C60 units. More recently we also employed the postpolymerization approach and synthesized successfully a series of soluble donor–π–acceptor double cable P3HT bearing C60 pendant with tunable donor/acceptor ratio and a pyrene-functionalized P3HT derivative. Thus, in the present work we manage to synthesize the novel PCBM-P3HT double cable donor–acceptor copolymer PCBM-Ph-P3HT by a postpolymerization approach as illustrated in Scheme 1, simplifying the synthesis to merely three steps. The first two-steps, i.e., step (i), bromine-substitution of P3HT and step (ii), HO-substitution of P3HT, follow the same procedures used in our previous works, while the third step involves the Steglich esterification reaction, resulting in the successful grafting of the PCBM moiety in the side chain with tunable substitution ratio (step (iii)). Despite that the substitution ratio of PCBM moiety versus thiophene unit can be tuned by controlling the molar ratio of the P3HT and N-bromosuccinimide in step (i) using our approach, in the present work a relatively low substitution ratio of PCBM moiety (ca. 3%) for PCBM-Ph-P3HT was studied in order to avoid dramatic perturbation of the conjugated structure of P3HT otherwise a higher proportion of PCBM would lead to the twisting of the P3HT backbone. In this way a good stability of PCBM-Ph-P3HT in air is achieved and confirmed experimentally.


Fig. 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of Br-P3HT, HO-Ph-P3HT and PCBM-Ph-P3HT in comparison to that of the pristine P3HT. The confirmation of the successful bromine- and HO-substitutions of P3HT affording Br-P3HT and HO-Ph-P3HT, respectively, was already given in our previous works, and a ca. 3% substitution ratio of bromine and hydroxyl of the P3HT backbone in Br-P3HT and HO-Ph-P3HT is calculated according to the integral ratio of H(f2) to H(f1) (see Fig. 1B and C). In the 1H NMR spectrum of PCBM-Ph-P3HT (Fig. 1D), obviously a new and clear proton signal around 5.16 ppm appears and is attributed to the protons of the methylene (–CH2–, H(j)) group linked to the ester group, indicating the successful grafting of the PCBM moiety at the 4-position of the thienyl ring. Noteworthy, the chemical shift of this methylene (–CH2–, H(j)) group within PCBM-Ph-P3HT is evidently down-field shifted versus that of HO-Ph-P3HT (4.71 ppm, see inset of Fig. 1C), indicating the 100% transformation of HO-Ph-P3HT to PCBM-Ph-P3HTvia the Steglich esterification reaction, which has been demonstrated to be one of the most efficient methods for the ester formation with high conversion rate owing to the catalytic ability of 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine. In the same way used above, the PCBM substitution ratio is determined to be ca. 3% for PCBM-Ph-P3HT based on the integral ratio of H(j) to H(a).
The 1H NMR spectrum of PCBM-Ph-P3HT is further compared to that of PCBA focusing on the proton signals from several methylene (–CH2–) groups between the carbonyl group and three-membered ring (H(k–m), see ESI). Interestingly, the chemical shifts of H(l) and H(m) within PCBM-Ph-P3HT clearly exhibit down-field shifts of about 0.03 ppm relative to those of PCBA, whereas the signal of H(k) remains unchanged. This is presumably because the electron withdrawing ability of C60 within PCBA is weakened due to the intramolecular interaction between P3HT and C60 molecules upon the formation of the donor–acceptor structure of PCBM-Ph-P3HT.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of P3HT, PCBA, Br-P3HT, HO-Ph-P3HT, and PCBM-Ph-P3HT in CHCl3 solution are compared in Fig. 2. The absorption maximum (λmax) of Br-P3HT (446 nm) was only slightly blue-shifted (4 nm) versus that of P3HT (450 nm), indicating that a 3% bromine-substitution of the P3HT backbone does not alter the P3HT backbone structure and the π–π intermolecular interactions among P3HT chains. This result is apparently different to what we observed for Br-P3HT with much higher bromine-substitution ratios (12–20%) reported in our previous works, in which a certain extent of twisting of the P3HT backbone due to the high-ratio of bromine-substitution was deduced from the large blue-shifts (13–23 nm) of λmax of Br-P3HTversus P3HT. For HO-Ph-P3HT, λmax stays almost constant compared to that of Br-P3HT (see inset of Fig. 2), again this phenomena is different to the case of HO-Ph-P3HT with higher HO-substitution ratios.

The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of PCBM-Ph-P3HT exhibits two broad absorption bands between 300 and 600 nm with three λmax observed at 328, 432, and 444 nm (Fig. 2d). Among them, λmax at 328 and 432 nm can be assigned to the absorption of the PCBM moiety according to the two characteristic absorption peaks at 331, 431 nm observed in the absorption spectrum of PCBA which are slightly shifted. In particular, the second λmax at 432 nm is commonly observed in the [6,6]-closed mono-adduct of C60. Another absorption band with λmax at around 444 nm is attributed to the P3HT component on the basis of its similarity with those of Br-P3HT and HO-P3HT, and originates from the π–π* transition of the P3HT backbone. Coincidentally, this λmax is partially overlapped with the second λmax at 432 nm but clearly detectable as a shoulder absorption band (see inset of Fig. 2). Noteworthy, λmax at around 444 nm of PCBM-Ph-P3HT experiences a blue-shift of 6 nm compared to that of P3HT, and this can be interpreted by the weak perturbation of the molecular arrangement of the P3HT backbone upon the grafting of the PCBM pendant. Thus, the successful addition of PCBA onto the HO-Ph-P3HT backbone is confirmed further since the absorption features of PCBM and P3HT components are both retained.
It is known that the fluorescence properties are useful for probing the intramolecular charge transfer dynamics between donor and acceptor specifically for the donor–acceptor systems based on fullerene derivatives.Fig. 3 illustrates the fluorescence spectrum of PCBM-Ph-P3HT in chlorobenzene in comparison with those of P3HT and P3HT/PCBM blend, which are measured under identical spectrophotometric parameters. For the P3HT/PCBM blend, numerous reports revealed that the fluorescence of P3HT can be quenched by PCBM due to intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer, and our measurement on the fluorescence spectrum of P3HT:PCBM (1:0.13) blend indicates a ∼52% quenching of the fluorescence of P3HT (Fig. 3a and b). However, for PCBM-Ph-P3HT, the fluorescence intensity of P3HT is much more quenched compared to that of P3HT/PCBM blend, being ∼63% quenching according to the integral of the fluorescence band (see Fig. 3c). These results indicate that a strong intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer originating from the covalent linkage of PCBM moiety to the P3HT backbone via the phenyl bridge takes place in PCBM-Ph-P3HT upon photoexcitation. Apparently, the intramolecular hybrid structure of PCBM-Ph-P3HT enables closer contact of the PCBM moiety with the thienyl ring via the phenyl bridge, facilitating their π–π interactions. In P3HT/PCBM blend, the π–π interactions between P3HT and PCBM in which P3HT and PCBM are physically mixed can only take place intermolecularly, thus a weaker quenching of the fluorescence of P3HT is achieved.

As mentioned above, P3HT and PCBM as the most commonly used donor and acceptor materials in BHJ-PSCs may suffer from considerable phase separation due to their immiscibility, limiting their PCE below 5%. In order to improve the miscibility of P3HT and PCBM, which is crucial for achieving their increased contact area and better phase separation, several different PCBM-P3HT intramolecular hybrids were doped into P3HT:PCBM blend solutions in a few reports. For instance, Wudl et al. synthesized the “donor–acceptor rod–coil” diblock copolymers (P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60) and found that the phase domains of P3HT and PCBM increased in size upon doping 5 wt% P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60 to the P3HT:PCBM blend mixture. This was explained by the migration of the P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60 block copolymer as a surfactant into the interface between P3HT and PCBM, resulting in the improved miscibility of P3HT and PCBM. Similarly, Jo et al. synthesized PCBM end-capped P3HT (P3HT-C60) and their TEM study revealed that P3HT-C60 doped at the optimized ratio of 2.5 wt% reduced the domain size of the P3HT:PCBM composite film and suppressed the macrophase separation for prolonged thermal annealing as an effective compatibilizer. In a similar way PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into a P3HT:PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios (1, 2, and 5 wt%) and the blend films of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM were prepared by casting from chlorobenzene followed by slow evaporation at room temperature for 10 min. Fig. 4 depicts the surface morphologies of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM blend films with 1, 2 and 5 wt% PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping in comparison with that of undoped P3HT:PCBM film measured by AFM in tapping mode. The surface morphology of the reference P3HT:PCBM film (image a) shows clearly P3HT- and PCBM-rich domains due to their macrophase separation, and the film surface is quite smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of around 0.46 nm. Upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping, different surface morphologies with increased RMS roughnesses (0.50, 0.58 and 0.81 nm for PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratios of 1, 2 and 5 wt%, respectively) are observed (images b–d), and obviously the RMS roughness increases with the increase of the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio. In addition, the phase mode AFM images of P3HT:PCBM film with/without PCBM-Ph-P3HT are also compared, suggesting that 2 and 5 wt% doping of PCBM-Ph-P3HT dramatically increase the phase separation of P3HT and PCBM as evidenced by the increased phase contrast, which seems however somewhat suppressed at 1 wt% doping of PCBM-Ph-P3HT (see images e–h). These results indicate that doping of PCBM-Ph-P3HT affects the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM film and such an influence is sensitively dependent on the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio. Similar to the cases of P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60 and P3HT-C60 reported in ref. 25 and 26, it is reasonable to assume that PCBM-Ph-P3HT promotes the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of P3HT:PCBM due to its amphiphilicity toward P3HT and PCBM components like a “surfactant”, whereas an overdoping of PCBM-Ph-P3HT most probably leads to the phase segregation of P3HT and PCBM components with the further enhancement of their compatibility.


Given that doping of PCBM-Ph-P3HT affects the miscibility of P3HT and PCBM as revealed from the above surface morphology study, we then studied the effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT on the performance of P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC devices which were fabricated in air. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC devices with different PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratios are compared in Fig. 5, and the measured photovoltaic parameters (short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), PCE) are summarized in Table 1. The reference P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC device without PCBM-Ph-P3HT (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al) exhibited a PCE of 3.03%, which is comparable to the reported values with devices fabricated under similar conditions (chlorobenzene as solvent). When PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped in the P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer with very low doping ratios of 0.5 and 1 wt%, obvious enhancements of PCE were observed from 3.13% to 3.40%, respectively. However, with the further increase of PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio to 2 wt%, the PCE of the device decreases to 3.28% (see Table 1). As a result, the PCE of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM device shows the maximum (3.40%) at the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt%, which has ca. 12% enhancement compared to that of reference P3HT:PCBM device.

A careful examination of each photovoltaic parameter is made so as to disclose the factor accounting for the enhancement of the PCE upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping. Clearly, Voc of PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM devices changes very slightly (0.60–0.63 V) compared to that of the reference P3HT:PCBM device. Likewise, FF experiences very subtle variation with and without PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping (see Table 1). Nevertheless, with the increase of the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio to 1 wt%, Jsc of the PCBM-Ph-P3HT:P3HT:PCBM device increases dramatically from 8.93 to 9.92 mA cm−2 (ca. 11% enhancement), and the enhancement ratio is quite comparable to that of the PCE. When the doping ratio of PCBM-Ph-P3HT is further increased to 2 wt%, Jsc decreases to 9.69 mA cm−2. Fig. 6 presents the dependence of the enhancements of Jsc and PCE on the PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio, clearly indicating the maximum enhancement of Jsc (ca. 11% enhancement) and PCE (ca. 12% enhancement) at the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt%. Hence, the enhancement of PCE is evidently attributed to the increase of Jsc. Interestingly, this phenomena is quite similar to the case of P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60 doping in P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC devices reported in ref. 25 in which an enhancement of Jsc leads to an increase in PCE, and the effect of P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60 is proposed to improve the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ composite.
On the basis of the similarity of the effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT on both the surface morphology of P3HT:PCBM film and device performance of P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC to that of P3HT-b-P(S8A2)-C60, the enhancement of Jsc resulting from PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping can be interpreted by a similar mechanism. Since Jsc is dependent on not only the multiplication of the photoinduced charge carrier density and the charge carrier mobility within the active material but also the interface properties between the active layers and the electrodes, presumably the improvement on the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT:PCBM components upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping, as revealed in the above surface morphology study, leads to the increase of the charge carrier mobility. Accordingly the decrease of Jsc with higher doping ratio of PCBM-Ph-P3HT (2 wt%) may be understood by the excessive phase segregation promoted by PCBM-Ph-P3HT which is unfavorable for charge carrier diffusion within the photoactive layer.

In summary, employing a postpolymerization approach followed by a Steglich esterification reaction, we have successfully synthesized a novel double cable donor–acceptor P3HT derivative (PCBM-Ph-P3HT), in which the PCBM moiety as the side chain is closely linked to the thiophene unit via a phenyl group. The Steglich esterification reaction involved in the last step was demonstrated to have a high conversion rate and simplified significantly the synthesis to merely three steps. The successful attachment of PCBM to the P3HT backbone is confirmed by both 1H NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopic studies, and the absorption features of PCBM and P3HT components are both retained in PCBM-Ph-P3HT. A dramatic quenching of the fluorescence of P3HT of ∼63% is observed for PCBM-Ph-P3HT, indicating that a strong intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer originating from the covalent linkage of the PCBM moiety to the P3HT backbone takes place upon photoexcitation.


PCBM-Ph-P3HT was doped into the P3HT:PCBM blend solution with different doping ratios (0.5, 1, 2 and 5 wt%) so as to investigate the effect of PCBM-Ph-P3HT on both the surface morphology of P3HT:PCBM film and device performance of P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSCs. The AFM study on the surface morphology of PCBM-Ph-P3HT doped P3HT:PCBM film reveals that PCBM-Ph-P3HT promotes the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT:PCBM due to its amphiphilicity toward P3HT and PCBM components like a “surfactant”. P3HT:PCBM BHJ-PSC devices doped by PCBM-Ph-P3HT show an enhanced PCE, with the maximum PCE being 3.40% at the optimum PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping ratio of 1 wt%, which has ca. 12% enhancement compared to that of the reference P3HT:PCBM device. The enhancement of PCE is evidently attributed to the increase of Jsc, and the enhancement mechanism proposed is that the improvement on the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the P3HT:PCBM blend upon PCBM-Ph-P3HT doping leads to an increase of the charge carrier mobility. The simplicity of our synthetic approach provides a new avenue for construction of donor–acceptor intramolecular hybrids, which shows advantages on tailoring the morphology of the photoactive layer and consequently the device performances of BHJ-PSCs.
