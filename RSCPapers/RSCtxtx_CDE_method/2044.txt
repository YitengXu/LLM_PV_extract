We synthesized and characterized a new low band-gap copolymer, PBTTFB, incorporating N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) as the acceptor and benzodithiophene (BDT) and (2,5-difluorophenylene)dithiophene as the donor units with S⋯F and S⋯O non-covalent intramolecular interactions. The PBTTFB polymer replaced bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) in P1, a previously reported polymer, with 5-dodecyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione and exhibited improved macromolecular planarity and molecular ordering of the molecular structure. UV-vis absorption, electrochemical properties, bulk-heterojuction (BHJ) film morphology, and molecular ordering as well as photovoltaic charaterization derived from PBTTFB were studied and analyzed to explore the effect of the thienopyrroledione unit instead of the benzodithiophene unit in the molecular backbone of the polymer. From photovoltaic charaterization, we obtained an enhanced Jsc value of 14.51 mA cm−2 from the PBTTFB polymer compared to the Jsc value of 10.54 mA cm−2 from P1 due to improved macromolecular planarity. Furthermore, PBTTFB exhibited the highest PCE of 8.25% by adding DPE as a processing additive due to better interpenetration networks for improving charge transport and collection.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention as renewable energy resources for the future owing to their low cost, light weight, and flexible and large area device fabrication through a solution process at room temperature. Recently, many research groups demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9–12% for single-junction and multi-junction PSCs. For their commercialization, however, improvement of the PCE is still needed, which can be achieved by developing efficient polymer donors for BHJ active materials. One of the most efficient strategies for improvement of the PCE has been developing a broad and low band-gap (LBG) polymer that should have a broad and strong absorption range in visible and near IR regions for harvesting solar radiation. It also has appropriated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels to achieved high open circuit voltage (Voc) and efficient charge separation with a fullerene acceptor in blend systems to form suitable compatibility with the fullerene acceptor for a nanoscale bi-continuous network. These strategies can affect the Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) of PSCs. Most representative approaches to achieve LBG properties are synthesizing materials composed of an electron donor and acceptor (D–A) type structure. The design strategy of D–A type alternative copolymers can induce intra molecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction to tune the optical band gap, improving the electronic and optical properties, charge mobility and crystallinity.

Recently, the N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) unit has emerged as a promising counterpart of the electron deficient moiety for push–pull architecture, due to its compact planar structure that could be beneficial to the electron delocalization into various conjugated polymers, strong electron affinity, resulting in the deep HOMO energy level and a wide absorption region. Moreover, it seems that it should promote intra- and interchain interactions along and between coplanar polymer chains and its strong electron withdrawing effect lead to lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels and desired properties to enhance the stability and the Voc in PSCs. Furthermore, TPD can be easily prepared in a few steps from commercially available compounds. Zou et al. have reported for the first time a new class of copolymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and TPD, and achieved a PCE of 5.5% by using a poly((4,8-diethylhexyloxyl)benzo([1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl)-alt-((5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione)-1,3-diyl) (PBDTTPD)/PC71BM blend for active materials.
Several research groups confirmed that copolymers based on BDT and TPD units can reach high power conversion efficiencies. Jen et al. reported a PCE of 4.1% for PBDTTPD/PC71BM, while Fréchet et al. and Xie et al. reported PCEs ranging from 4.0% to 6.8% for a series of alkylated TPD-based copolymers. McGehee et al. also reported a power conversion efficiency of 7.3% with a high molecular weight of the PBDTTPD polymer.
In this study, a new copolymer, PBTTFB, is designed and synthesized by incorporating TPD as the acceptor and BDT and (2,5-difluorophenylene)dithiophene as the donor units with S⋯F and S⋯O non-covalent intramolecular interactions as shown in Fig. 1a. By replacing the electron deficient bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) in the previously reported polymer (P1) with 5-dodecyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione in PBTTFB (Fig. 1a), improved macromolecular planarity and molecular ordering are achieved due to S⋯F and S⋯O non-covalent intramolecular interactions. These non-covalent intramolecular interactions could influence the chain planarity, interchain organization, film morphology, and electrical and photovoltaic properties significantly. From the photovoltaic measurements, the BHJ PSCs of P1 and PBTTFB showed a PCE of 5.95% and 8.25%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently among the highest PCE values reported so far for TPD based polymers. The higher PCE of the PBTTFB device can improve planarity by replacing the BT unit with the TPD unit while P1 can induce steric hindrance between the bulky BDT and BT to decrese planarity.

All starting materials and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers unless otherwise specified, and used without further purification. In particular, M2 was prepared according to the procedure in the literature. A microwave reactor (Biotage Initiator™) was used to synthesize the polymers. UV-vis spectra were obtained with a Mecasys Optizen Pop spectrophotometer. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with chlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 °C on a Waters 1515 system, relative to polystyrene standards. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed with an AutoLab analyzer. All CV measurements were carried out in 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumtetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) in acetonitrile with platinum as a counter electrode, a 3 mm glassy carbon electrode coated with a thin polymer film as a working electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as a reference electrode.

Polymerization of PBTTFB: M1 (0.475 g, 0.525 mmol), M2 (0.106 g, 0.175 mmol), M3 (0.336 g, 0.700 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (2 mol%), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (8 mol%) and 7 mL degassed chlorobenzene were added into a 10 mL microwave vial. The polymerization reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 10 min, at 150 °C for 20 min, at 170 °C for 30 min and at 180 °C for 10 min in a microwave reactor. After the polymerization, the polymer was end capped with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene and 4-bromobenzotrifluoride at 150 °C for 30 min each. Polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, dichloromethane and chloroform. The extracted compound in chloroform was precipitated with methanol, filtered and dried. Yield = 54%, number average molecular weight (Mn) = 36.8 kDa, and polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.51.

The PSCs with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBTTFB:PC71BM/Al and an inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/PBTTFB:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated by using the following procedure. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were cleaned with detergent and ultra-sonicated in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially and dried into an oven for 12 h. Poly(3,4-ethy lenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron AI4083) solution was spin-cast at 5000 rpm on cleaned ITO substrates after UV-ozone treatment for 15 min and dried at 150 °C for 15 min to remove moisture. In the case of the inverted device, ZnO was used for the ETL layer. ZnO was deposited by spin-coating a solution of diethylzinc (5 wt%) dissolved in a 1:2 mixture of toluene:tetrahydrofuran(THF) at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto cleaned ITO substrates and then dried for 10 min at 110 °C in air. For depositing the active layer, a chlorobenzene solution consisting of PBTTFB and PC71BM with diphenylether (DPE) (3 vol%) was prepared and spin-cast on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Subsequently, the Al (100 nm) electrode was deposited on the active layer under vacuum (<10−6 Torr) by thermal evaporation. The area of the Al electrode defined the active area of the device as 13 mm2. The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured by using a Keithley 2635A source measurement Unit. The solar cell performance was tested with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. EQE measurements were obtained using the PV measurement QE system by applying monochromatic light from a xenon lamp under ambient conditions. The space charge limited-current (SCLC) mobilities were calculated by using the equation:
where
εr is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, L is the distance between the cathode and the anode, which is equivalent to the film thickness, and V is the applied voltage.


We synthesized a new donor random-copolymer, coded PBTTFB, using (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) and 1,4-bis(5-trimethylstannyl)thiophene-2,5-diflurobenzene as electron-donating units and 1,3-dibromo-5-dodecyl-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione as the electron-withdrawing uint, which has a similar backbone structure to previously reported polymer P1 as shown in Fig. 1 and S1. PBTTFB has adopted N-alkyl thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as the electron-withdrawing moiety to replace bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as the electron-withdrawing unit in P1. Polymer P1 has steric hindrance by the collision between the bulky ethylhexyl-thiophene of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and the dodecyloxy side chain of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole to decrease planarity, while PBTTFB can induce non-covalent intramolecular interactions to promote macromolecular planarity without steric hindrance. In order to achieve this approach, first, we had synthesized a random-copolymer consisting of 1,4-bis(5-trimethylstannyl)thiophene-2,5-diflurobenzene and (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) with a ratio of 0.5:0.5. However, unfortunately, this polymer was insoluble in all solvents even at high temperatures. To overcome the solubility problem, we tried to control the ratio of monomers, and finally found the optimized ratio of monomers to be 0.25:0.75. The synthesis of the polymer is outlined in Scheme 1. The monomers, M1 and M3, were purchased from commercial suppliers, and monomer M2 was prepared according to the literature. The PBTTFB was readily synthesized via Stille-coupling polymerization using three monomers in a yield of 54%. The synthetic procedures are described in detail in the Experimental section. After polymerization, the polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, dichloromethane, and chloroform, and then the chloroform fraction was recovered. The polymer possesses good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene.

The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI, Mw/Mn) of the PBTTFB were determined by carrying out gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 80 °C in chlorobenzene as an eluent, relative to polystyrene standards. The Mn value of PBTTFB is 36.8 kDa with a PDI of 1.51. The Mn of PBTTFB is lower than that of P1 (Mn ∼67.8 kDa) indicating improved macromolecular planarity caused by non-covalent intramolecular interactions between oxygen from TPD and the sulfur at proximate BDT.

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of copolymer PBTTFB in chlorobenzene solution and as a thin film are presented in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding optoelectronic properties, including the absorption peak wavelengths, absorption edge wavelengths, and optical band gaps, are summarized in Table 1. The PBTTFB covers the absorption from 300 to 650 nm. The UV spectra of both in solution and in films exhibited a distinct shoulder peak next to the absorption maximum, which is typical of BDT-based copolymers. The corresponding optical band-gap of the PBTTFB solid-state is 1.89 eV, which is slightly higher than that of the P1 polymer. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S1), performed with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. To estimate the HOMO level of PBTTFB from the vacuum energy level, we used the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as a calibration reference. The half-wave potential for oxidation of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple is −4.8 eV, below the vacuum level. The HOMO energy level of PBTTFB was estimated to be −5.58 eV, which is lower than that of the P1 polymer.

To understand the macromolecular conformation of the designed copolymers, the ground state of isolated molecular repeating density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the B3LYP hybrid exchange correlation functional and the 6-31G** basis set. Computational costs of the unit in copolymers were calculated in the gas phase, independently. We obtained calculated torsional profiles by DFT calculations.
As shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S3, the energy minimum torsional angles from P1 were calculated to be 4.42° for thiophene and BT units. However, PBTTFB showed lower torsional angles with 0.24° for thiophene and TPD units, leading to chain planarity and the ordering structure of the polymer in solid films.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the PBTTFB polymer, we fabricated a conventional device structure with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBTTFB:PC71BM/Al. The detailed device fabrication is described in the Experimental section. To optimize the PSC device, the devices were tested by changing the PBTTFB:PC71BM ratio and several processing additives (DPE, DIO, CN), shown in Fig. 3 and S4 and are summarized in Tables 2 and S1.

The BHJ films were fabricated using chlorobenzene as a solvent. As shown in Table S2, the PSCs with the P1 polymer were reported in previous work. The optimized devices were obtained with a donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio of 1:1.5 for the BHJ film using a solvent mixture of chlorobenzene and DPE (97:3 vol%). Fig. 3a shows the J–V characteristics of the optimized device based PBTTFB polymer under illumination of simulated 1.5G condition (100 mW cm−2) and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Without the processing additive condition, the PBTTFB:PC71BM device exhibited a PCE of 6.01% with a Jsc of 10.01 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.87 V and FF of 0.69, whereas PSCs with the P1 polymer showed a PCE of 2.44% with a Jsc of 5.00 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.89 V and FF of 0.55, respectively(Table S3). In particular, we obtained higher Jsc from the PBTTFB polymer due to improved planarity of the molecular backbone. The processing additive enhances the device performance significantly by controlling the nanoscale morphology of the BHJ film.
In particular, the PSC with PBTTFB:PC71BM exhibited the highest PCE of 8.25% by adding DPE as a processing additive due to improved Jsc from 10.01 to 14.51 mA cm−2. We also tested inverted device architecture under the same conditions as those used for the optimized PBTTFB conventional device. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S3, an inverted polymer solar cell (iPSC) with PBTTFB polymer exhibited the PCE of 6.27% with Jsc of 9.35 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.96 V and FF of 0.70, respectively. Interestingly, iPSCs of PBTTFB showed higher Voc and FF compared to the conventional device although PCE of iPSC with PBTTFB showed low PCE. The corresponding IPCE spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3b, showing a broad response from 300 to 700 nm. In particular, the maximum IPCE of 83.1% was measured at 510 nm for PBTTFB:PC71BM with DPE compared to that without the DPE condition. After adding DPE as a processing additive, the IPCE was enhanced 35% in the visible region compared to that without DPE. The calculated Jsc values were obtained by integrating the IPCE spectra with respect to wavelength, consistent with the measured ones within 5% error and are listed in Table 2.

To correlate the morphology of the active layer with device performance caused by the additive, we examined the nanoscale morphology of blend films by tapping mode AFM and two dimensional GIWAXS. The AFM topography and phase images of both BHJ films show a clearly different morphology with and without DPE. As shown in Fig. 4, the blend film of PBTTFB:PC71BM fabricated without DPE had a rough surface morphology with a root mean square (rms) roughness of 3.38 nm with large phase separation. This large phase separation may induce a poor charge carrier mobility and deterioration of exciton dissociation probability by reducing donor/acceptor interfacial areas, causing low Jsc and FF. Here, in accordance with adding DPE, the blend films showed a smooth surface (rms roughness of 1.17 nm) with a finely bicontinuous network. This morphological change created better interpenetration networks for improving the charge transport and collection explained the enhancement in the PCE of the PSC device based on PBTTFB with DPE.

We also examined the correlation of molecular orientation and intermolecular packing structure with device performance by carrying out grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. Fig. 5 and S6 show the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and Table S5 summarizes the extracted packing parameters from GIWAXS profiles. The pristine film of PBTTFB showed a strong (100) lamellar peak and a (010) π–π stacking peak in the in-plane direction and out-of-plane direction.
After blending with PC71BM, the π–π stacking (010) peak remains in the out-of-plane direction. However, the π–π stacking distance decreased slightly 3.53 Å from 3.55 Å with the pristine film. Upon the addition of DPE, it can be noticed that the blend films showed decreased π–π stacking distances (blend: 3.53 Å, and blend with DPE: 3.52 Å), implying a strong interchain packing with DPE.
The strong π–π stacking and pronounced face-on orientation are favorable to charge transport in the vertical direction in BHJ PSCs; the GIWAXS results can be clearly supported the remarkable Jsc enhancement by the introduction of DPE.

To quantify the charge-carrier mobilities, hole (μhole) and electron (μelectron) mobilities of the BHJ PSCs with DPE were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 6a and b, Table S4). The hole-only(ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBTTFB:PC71BM/Al) and electron-only (FTO/PBTTFB:PC71BM/Al) devices were prepared using optimized BHJ films. The average hole and electron mobilities were determined to be μhole = 2.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 6.41 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μelectron = 2.26 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.63 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBTTFB BHJ devices with and without DPE, respectively. In the presence of DPE, PBTTFB polymers showed well balanced ratios of electron/hole mobility due to enhancement of μhole with the BHJ device with DPE, which can be beneficial for reducing charge recombination and enhancing Jsc. We also examined the light intensity dependent J–V characteristics under short circuit conditions. Fig. 6c shows a log–log plot of Jsc as a function of light intensity. The curve was fitted by the power-law dependence of Jsc on the light intensity. The light intensity dependence of Jsc can be used to determine if the Jsc is limited by bimolecular recombination. By fitting the photocurrent plots using the following equation,

Jsc ∝ Iα
(1)
where
I is the light intensity and α is the exponent constant for BHJ PSCs. The value of α was determined to be 0.992 with DPE, indicating weak bimolecular recombination at short circuit compared to the α value of 0.981 in blend without DPE. As shown in Fig. 6d, we studied the photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics. The Jph is defined as the difference between the current density under illumination (JL) and dark conditions (JD) (JL − JD) Veff is the voltage difference between compensation voltage (V0) at Jph = 0 and applied voltage, V (Veff = V0 − V). The saturation Jph suggested the effective charge sweep out and extraction of photo-generated charge carriers with negligible recombination. Upon addition of DPE, it showed higher Jph and saturation of Jph at the lower Veff = 0.5 V. These results are consistent with the device performance and other results. To achieve high performance photovoltaic devices, high charge-carrier mobility and balanced carrier transport are important prerequisite conditions.


In summary, we synthesized and characterized a new random copolymer, PBTTFB, which can induce non-covalent intramolecular interactions to promote macromolecular planarity without steric hindrance. Replacing the electron deficient BT unit in the P1 polymer with the TPD unit in PBTTFB promoted the crystallinity and planarity of the polymer backbone leading to enhancement of the PSC performance of the PBTTFB polymer. A PCE of 8.25% was obtained with PBTTFB with Jsc of 14.25 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.88 V and FF of 0.65. To date, this is currently among the highest PCE values reported for TPD based polymers. In addition, the PBTTFB polymer showed a good candidate as a non-fullerene BHJ PSC such as ITIC materials, ternary PSCs and a front subcell in tandem PSCs.
