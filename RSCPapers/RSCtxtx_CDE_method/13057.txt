Inorganic and organic solar cells always operate at a temperature lower than 100 °C and are not suitable for operating at high temperature. In this work, using blends of a small molecule donor and a polymer acceptor (MD/PA-type) as the active layers, we develop efficient and stable organic solar cells (OSCs), which can operate at a temperature of up to 150 °C. The device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.51%, which is the highest value reported to date for MD/PA-type OSCs. After thermal treatment at 150 °C for 72 hours, the device can retain 84% of its initial PCE value. This superior device stability at high temperature is attributed to the high phase transition temperatures of the two materials in the MD/PA-type active layer. This work suggests a new advantage of high-temperature tolerance for OSCs.

Solar cells are an endless clean energy technology and their thermal stability is an important issue. The temperature of solar cells can be 70 °C under solar irradiation on earth and can be even higher in outer space. For instance, the temperature of solar cells of a satellite under solar irradiation can reach 150 °C, and the temperature on the moon’s surface can reach 200 °C. However, typical solar cells are not suitable for working at high temperature. Inorganic solar cells, e.g. silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells, exhibit greatly decreased power conversion efficiency (PCE) at high temperature because the much increased charge carrier density at high temperature leads to serious charge recombination and consequently a low fill factor (FF) and low open-circuit voltage (VOC). For dye-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells, the electrolyte or the active materials cannot tolerate such high temperature. OSCs have the great advantage of flexibility and light weight. Recently the PCE of OSCs has been enhanced dramatically to over 17%. However, owing to the insufficient thermal stability of the active layer, typical OSCs cannot operate at high temperature, either.

High-efficiency OSCs use blends of polymer donors and small molecule acceptors (PD/MA-type) as the active layers. As small molecule acceptors always exhibit relatively low phase transition temperature and low crystallinity, they tend to self-aggregate or crystallize at high temperature. Therefore, active layers of polymer donor/small molecule acceptor blends suffer from moderate morphological stability at high temperature. An alternative kind of OSC is to use the combination of polymer acceptors and small molecule donors (MD/PA-type), which has been reported to show excellent thermal stability. This is due to the high phase transition temperature and high crystallinity of small molecule donors. However, compared with other types of OSCs, MD/PA-type OSCs are rarely studied and they generally suffer from low PCEs. Recently, our group has reported MD/PA-type OSCs with a PCE of 8.0% based on a small molecule donor with weak π–π stacking and a polymer acceptor containing a boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B←N).
In this manuscript, using a new combination of small molecule donors and polymer acceptors, we demonstrate MD/PA-type OSCs with superior thermal stability and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). As shown in Fig. 1a, the small molecule donor, (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-(((4,8-bis(9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(3′,3′′-dioctyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5′′,5-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (BD3T), has carbazolyl substituted benzodithiophene as the core unit, 3,4′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3T) as the bridge unit and 3-ethylrhodanine as the terminal group. Owing to its high crystallinity and high crystallization temperature (Tc), BD3T exhibits excellent phase stability and leads to the superior thermal stability of the OSC devices. The polymer acceptor, poly[4-(5-(5,10-bis(2-dodecylhexadecyl)-4,4,9,9-tetrafluoro-7-methyl-4,5,9,10-tetrahydro-3a,5,8a,10-tetraaza-4,9-diborapyren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (PBN-15) (see Fig. 1a), exhibits strong aggregation tendency in solution, resulting in an excellent active layer morphology and consequently high device efficiency. As a result, the OSC device of BD3T:PBN-15 exhibits a PCE of 9.5% and can retain 84% of its initial PCE value after thermal treatment at 150 °C for 3 days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OSC operating at a temperature higher than 100 °C and its PCE is the highest value reported so far for MD/PA-type OSCs.

To investigate the effect of polymer acceptors on the device efficiency of MD/PA-type OSCs, we select two polymer acceptors containing the B←N unit, poly[4-(5-(5,10-bis(2-dodecylhexadecyl)-4,4,9,9-tetrafluoro-7-methyl-4,5,9,10-tetrahydro-3a,5,8,10-tetraaza-4,9-diborapyren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole] (PBN-14) and PBN-15. Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of PBN-14 and PBN-15. Compared with PBN-14, PBN-15 possesses two extra fluorine substituents on the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit, which are expected to affect the active layer morphology of OSCs. PBN-14 and PBN-15 were synthesized following our previous method. The number-average molecular weight (Mn)/polydispersity index (PDI) are 72.4 kDa/1.71 for PBN-14 and 80.7 kDa/2.44 for PBN-15. The synthetic route of the small molecule donor, BD3T, is illustrated in Fig. S1. BD3T was readily prepared by two-step reactions in high yield. The chemical structure of BD3T is confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (MS) and elemental analysis (Fig. S2 and S3). According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S4), BD3T exhibits good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 390 °C.


The phase transition behaviors of the small molecule donor and the two polymer acceptors are studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. 1c, both the polymer acceptors show no phase transitions in a wide range from 30 to 300 °C. BD3T exhibits a melting/crystallization temperature (Tm/Tc) of as high as 273.4 °C/243.4 °C with an enthalpy change (ΔHm/ΔHc) of 54.9 J g−1/52.6 J g−1. For the BD3T:PBN-14 blend and the BD3T:PBN-15 blend, the melting/crystallization behavior of BD3T is almost unaffected (Fig. S5 and Table S1). Both the blends exhibit no phase transition behaviors in a wide range from 30 to 220 °C, indicating superior phase stability at high temperature.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of BD3T, PBN-14 and PBN-15 in solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. S6 and 2a, respectively. The characteristics are listed in Table 1. In chlorobenzene (CB) solution, BD3T shows an absorption maximum (λmax) at 518 nm with a high extinction coefficient (εmax) of 1.05 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In the thin film, BD3T exhibits the maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 583 nm with a shoulder at 633 nm. The redshifted absorption peak from the solution to the thin film suggests strong intermolecular interaction of BD3T in the solid state. The wide absorption spectrum of BD3T indicates great sunlight harvesting capability for OSC applications. According to the onset absorption wavelength, the optical band gap (Eoptg) of BD3T, PBN-14 and PBN-15 is estimated to be 1.76 eV, 1.77 eV and 1.82 eV, respectively. Fig. S7 shows the temperature-dependent absorption spectra of PBN-14 and PBN-15 in CB solution. As the temperature increases from 30 to 110 °C, the long-wavelength absorption peaks gradually decrease and blueshift due to the dis-aggregation of the polymer chains in solution. The relative intensity of the long-wavelength absorption peak at 110 °C is stronger for PBN-15 than for PBN-14, suggesting that PBN-15 has stronger aggregation tendency in solution than PBN-14. This aggregation tendency in solution of PBN-14 and PBN-15 is expected to affect their molecular stacking and phase separation morphology in thin films.

The molecule stacking properties of BD3T, PBN-14 and PBN-15 in thin films were examined using the two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) method. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns are shown in Fig. S8. The neat BD3T film exhibits multiple order reflections at 3.2 nm−1, 6.4 nm−1 and 9.5 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction and a reflection at 16.4 nm−1 in the in-plane direction. The crystalline coherence length (CCL) of the (100) reflection in the out-of-plane direction is estimated to be 21.3 nm. This suggests that BD3T is highly crystalline and adopts an edge-on orientation in the thin film. Both the neat PBN-14 and PBN-15 films exhibit the (010) reflection in the out-of-plane direction and the (100) reflection in the in-plane direction, indicating a dominant face-on orientation. The (010) reflection peaks in the out-of-plane direction of the PBN-14 film and PBN-15 film are at 17.1 nm−1 and 16.7 nm−1, respectively. Compared with the PBN-14 film, the PBN-15 film shows a relatively larger CCL of the (010) reflection in the out-of-plane direction, indicating strong π–π stacking of PBN-15. The strong π–π stacking of PBN-15 in the thin film is probably attributed to the strong aggregation tendency of polymer chains in solution.
We employed cyclic voltammetry to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the three materials. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels (EHOMO/ELUMO) of BD3T (−5.11 eV/−3.23 eV) are higher than those of PBN-14 (−5.58 eV/−3.53 eV) and PBN-15 (−5.78 eV/−3.65 eV) (Fig. 2b). The offsets of HOMO and LUMO energy levels between them are sufficient for efficient photo-induced hole and electron transfer. The charge transport properties of the three materials were investigated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S16). The hole mobility (μh) of the small molecule donor BD3T is estimated to be 4.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high hole mobility is consistent with the high crystallinity of BD3T. The electron mobilities (μe) of the polymer acceptors PBN-14 and PBN-15 are estimated to be 1.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobility of PBN-15 is higher than that of PBN-14 possibly due to the improved crystallinity in thin films.

The MD/PA-type OSCs were fabricated using BD3T as the electron donor and PBN-14 or PBN-15 as the electron acceptor with an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/BD3T:PBN-14 or PBN-15/MoO3/Al. The detailed device fabrication is described in the ESI. After device optimization (Fig. S9–S14 and Tables S3–S8), the donor:acceptor weight ratios for the active layers are 2.5:1, and thermal annealing of the active layers at 180 °C for 10 min is applied. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 3a and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The BD3T:PBN-14 based device shows a PCE of 5.06%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 7.16 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63. The BD3T:PBN-15 based device exhibits a PCE of 9.51%, with a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 13.82 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.66. It is worth noting that the PCE of the BD3T:PBN-15 based device is the highest value reported to date for MD/PA-type OSCs. Compared with the PBN-14-based device, the PBN-15-based device exhibits a lower VOC value, which is ascribed to the lower LUMO energy level of PBN-15 than PBN-14. The increased JSC and FF of the PBN-15-based device are due to the improved phase separation morphology of the active layer (vide infra). Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices. The maximum EQE values reach 42% at 660 nm for the BD3T:PBN-14 based device and reach 74% at 560 nm for the BD3T:PBN-15 based device. The JSC values calculated by the integration of the EQE spectra are 6.84 mA cm−2 for BD3T:PBN-14 and 12.85 mA cm−2 for BD3T:PBN-15, which are consistent with the measured JSC values by J–V measurements.

To investigate the reason behind the different device performances of the two polymer acceptors, we studied the active layer morphology by 2D-GIWAXS and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The 2D-GIWAXS patterns of the blend films are shown in Fig. 4a and b and the corresponding scattering profiles in the out-of-plane/in-plane directions are shown in Fig. 4c. For the BD3T:PBN-14 blend, the (100) lamellar stacking peak at 3.2 nm−1 in the in-plane direction and the (010) peak at 16.5 nm−1 in the out-of-plane are attributed to BD3T. The diffraction signals of PBN-14 are negligible, indicating that only BD3T crystallizes and that the crystallization of PBN-14 is suppressed. The BD3T:PBN-15 blend shows a sharp (010) peak at 16.5 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction, which is attributed to the signal superposition of both BD3T and PBN-15. This indicates that both BD3T and PBN-15 crystallize during the film-forming process. The CCL of the BD3T:PBN-15 blend is smaller than that of the BD3T:PBN-14 blend, suggesting weaker crystallinity in the BD3T:PBN-15 blend than the BD3T:PBN-14 blend. The AFM height images of the two blends are shown in Fig. 4d and e. The surface of the BD3T:PBN-14 blend is rougher than the surface of BD3T:PBN-15, indicating small-size aggregates in the latter case. As shown in Fig. S18, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiency of the donor for the BD3T:PBN-14 blend and BD3T:PBN-15 blend is 85.1% and 92.1%, respectively. The high PL quenching efficiency for the BD3T:PBN-15 blend also suggests small-size phase separation. The smaller phase separation size contributes to the higher JSC and PCE of the BD3T:PBN-15 based device than the BD3T:PBN-14 based device. In the BD3T:PBN-14 blend, BD3T probably over-crystallizes and leads to large-size phase separation. In contrast, for the BD3T:PBN-15 blend, the crystallization of BD3T is suppressed by the aggregation and crystallization of PBN-15, resulting in small-size phase separation. These results indicate the important role of the polymer acceptors in the active layer morphology and photovoltaic performance of MD/PA-type OSCs.


The hole mobility and electron mobility of the two active layers were measured using the SCLC method with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/PEIE/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. The J–V curves and the SCLC fittings are presented in Fig. S17. The BD3T:PBN-14 blend shows a hole mobility (μh) of 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe of 1.68. The BD3T:PBN-15 blend shows a μh of 3.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 2.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe of 1.01. The higher and more balanced charge transport of the BD3T:PBN-15 blend is consistent with the higher FF of the corresponding OSC device.


To investigate the charge generation, collection and recombination behaviors of the two blends, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) and the dependence of JSC on the light density (P) of the OSC devices. As shown in Fig. S19a,Jph increases with Veff increasing in a low Veff region and then becomes saturated at a high Veff (>3 V). Jph,SC is the Jph under short circuit conditions and Jph,sat is the Jph at saturation. The Jph,sat of the BD3T:PBN-15 based device (14.59 mA cm−2) is higher than that of the BD3T:PBN-14 based device (9.26 mA cm−2), which may be due to the small-size phase separation in the former case. The Jph,SC/Jph,sat values of the BD3T:PBN-15 device and the BD3T:PBN-14 device are 0.94 and 0.77, respectively. This suggests that the charge collection is more efficient in the former case than in the latter case. The relationship between JSC and light intensity (P) is represented by the power-law equation JSC ∝ Pα while the α value close to 1 indicates negligible bimolecular recombination, and α < 1 indicates some extent of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. S19b, the α values of BD3T:PBN-14 and BD3T:PBN-15 based devices are 0.92 and 0.96, respectively, which indicate that the bimolecular recombination is more suppressed in the BD3T:PBN-15 based device. The efficient charge generation and collection, and the suppressed charge recombination contribute to the high JSC and FF of the BD3T:PBN-15 based device.


We investigated the thermal stability of the MD/PA-type OSCs using the inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/BD3T:PBN-15/PEDOT:PSS/Ag (Fig. 1b). PEDOT:PSS instead of MoO3 was used as the hole transport layer to avoid the insufficient thermal stability of MoO3.Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the device at different temperatures. With the temperature increase from 25 °C to 150 °C, the VOC decreases slightly from 1.01 V to 0.98 V, the JSC increases slightly from 12.85 mA cm−2 to 13.59 mA cm−2 and FF decreases slightly from 0.62 to 0.59. As a result, the PCE decreased very slightly from 8.05% to 7.85% (Tables S10 and S11). The slightly decreased VOC and FF at high temperature are due to the increased bimolecular charge recombination because the charge carrier density becomes higher at increased temperature. Inorganic solar cells, such as Si, CIGS and CdTe solar cells, exhibit greatly decreased VOC and FF at high temperature due to the high charge recombination rate. The dependence of VOC and FF on operating temperature of the BD3T:PBN-15 based OSCs is much weaker than those of inorganic solar cells. In addition, we also fabricated a control OSC device of the conventional PD/MA type with poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate)-4,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th):(5E,5′E)-5,5′-((7,7′-(4,4,9,9-tetrakis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-7,4-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) (EH-IDTBR) as the active layer. It is worth noting that the PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR active layer is among the most stable PD/MA-type OSCs reported so far. We thermally treated the BD3T:PBN-15 based device and the PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR based device at 150 °C for 72 hours. Fig. 5b shows the dependence of the PCE of the two devices on the thermal treatment time. The PCE of the BD3T:PBN-15 device retains 84% of its initial value after thermal treatment at 150 °C for 72 hours (Table S12). In comparison, the device of PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR exhibits a large PCE decrease and retains only 62% of the initial PCE value (Table S13). These results prove the excellent thermal stability of the BD3T:PBN-15 based device. These results also indicate that MD/PA-type OSCs are suitable for high temperature photovoltaic applications.

We monitored the morphology of BD3T:PBN-15 and PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR active layers during the thermal treatment at 150 °C using polarized optical microscopy (POM) and AFM (Fig. S20 and S21). As shown in Fig. 6, the POM images of the BD3T:PBN-15 active layer remain almost unchanged during the thermal treatment. In contrast, for the PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR active layer, lots of clusters emerge after thermal treatment for 24 hours and become larger during the thermal treatment process. The clusters are probably attributed to the crystalline small molecule acceptor EH-IDTBR. These results indicate that the morphological instability leads to the decreased PCE of the PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR based device during thermal treatment at high temperature. The high phase transition temperatures of BD3T and PBN-15 lead to the excellent blend morphological stability and contribute to the superior device thermal stability of the BD3T:PBN-15 active layer.

In conclusion, we have developed an efficient and stable MD/PA-type OSC device with BD3T as the small molecule donor and PBN-15 as the polymer acceptor. The device exhibits not only a high PCE of 9.5%, but also superior thermal stability, i.e. operating at 150 °C. The strong aggregation tendency in solution of the polymer acceptor PBN-15 leads to the small-size phase separation in the active layer and consequently the high PCE of the OSC device. The high phase transition temperatures of BD3T and PBN-15 result in the excellent blend morphology stability and consequently superior device stability at high temperature. This work suggests a new advantage of high-temperature tolerance for organic solar cells.
