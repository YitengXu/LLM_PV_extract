In order to search for new wide band gap materials, vertical benzodithiophene (BDT) is designed as an electron donating unit to construct D–A type conjugated polymers. Two polymers PVB1 and PVB2 were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction with benzothiadiazole (BT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) as the accepting moieties, respectively. These polymers show wide optical band gaps of over 2.0 eV and low HOMO energy levels of below −5.5 eV. Polymer solar cell (PSC) devices were fabricated using the above polymers as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors. PSCs based on PVB1 and PC71BM showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.84% with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 6.80 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.42. And PSCs based on PVB2 and PC71BM showed a PCE of 2.05% with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 5.33 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.35. Both polymers showed a high Voc of over 1.0 V, which should be attributed to the deep-lying HOMO levels of the polymers. They would be potential candidates as wide band gap components to construct tandem solar cells.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention in the past few decades due to the advantages of light weight, low cost and flexibility. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs have been proven to be the most successful device architecture with a conjugated polymer as an electron donor (D) and a fullerene-based [6,6]-phenyl-(C61 or C71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM) derivative as an acceptor (A), respectively. This structure dramatically enlarges the D/A interface area, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% in a single junction device have been achieved in recent years.

As is well known, the PCE value is determined by open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). In order to improve the performance, low band gap (LBG) polymers were usually designed to expand optical absorption. However, this strategy could usually result in the increase of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the Voc could be reduced thereof. Comparatively, wide band gap (WBG) polymers (Eg > 1.8 eV) could induce high Voc due to their deep HOMO level, thus attracting much attention in recent years. A carbazole-based polymer is a widely investigated wide band gap material for PSCs. Tao et al. achieved a PCE of 7.1% using PCDTBT:PC71BM as the active layer with a large Voc of 0.92 V. Leclerc et al. reported a carbazole-based polymer with thieno-[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) as the acceptor unit and a large Voc of 1.07 V was obtained with a PCE of 1.8%. Sun et al. developed another WBG polymer PDBT-T1 (Eoptg = 1.85 eV), which shows a high PCE of 9.74% with a Voc of 0.92 V. The wide band gap polymer can also be applied in tandem solar cells or ternary solar cells, which include two or more stacking layers to absorb different parts of sun light and have made great achievements in recent years. The exploration of new kinds of wide band gap polymers also facilitates the improvement of tandem solar cells.
The benzodithiophene (BDT) unit has emerged as an effective building block for the construction of organic photovoltaic materials due to its ideal planar conjugated structure. It is usually incorporated into the conjugated main chain from α-positions of thiophenes fused to the phenyl core. There are only limited reports which incorporated the BDT unit from 4,8-positions on benzene. We have firstly incorporated the BDT unit from 4,8-positions to construct poly(aryleneethynylene) (PAE) type polymers. However, these materials exhibit poor solubility and blend film morphology due to the rigid triple-bond bridged backbone, which encumber their solar cell performance. In this work, we therefore replaced the triple-bond by the thiophene unit to construct D–π–A type conjugated polymers (Scheme 1), which is expected to improve the solubility and blend film morphology. The vertical BDT is used as the donating moiety and benzothiadiazole (BT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) are used as the accepting moieties, respectively. Two polymers PVB1 and PVB2 were synthesized and exhibited large band gaps and low HOMO energy levels. A high Voc of 1.09 V was obtained for PVB2 with a PCE of 2.05%. These results indicate that the vertical BDT unit is a potential building block for the construction of wide band gap polymers with high open circuit voltage in PSC devices.

All reactions and manipulations were carried out under Ar. Solvents were dried by standard procedures. The reagents were used directly unless otherwise noted. All column chromatography was performed with the use of silica gel 200–300 mesh. Monomer 5 and polymers were synthesized according to the reported procedures.



1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AVANCE-III 600 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Lambda25 spectrophotometer. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by GPC using THF as the solvent and polystyrene as the standard at 40 °C. TGA was performed on a SDT Q600 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation in a solution of tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The three-electrode system was composed of a glass carbon electrode coated with the sample film as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Potentials were referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple by using ferrocene as a standard. Atomic Force Microscope measurements were performed using an Agilent 5400 in the tapping mode under ambient conditions. The X-ray diffraction spectra were taken on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer.


Conventional BHJ-PSC devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The ITO-coated glasses with a nominal sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, ultrapure water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol subsequently. After a 10 min oxygen plasma treatment, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO anode and then dried at 160 °C for 20 min. The polymer and PC71BM were dissolved in chlorobenzene with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1. The solution was stirred overnight and spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the active layer was ∼90 nm. Finally, 10 nm Ca and 100 nm Al layers were successively thermally evaporated onto the active layer at a pressure of 4.0 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device in this work was 0.1 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley2420 source measurement under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) from a Newport solar simulator. A standard silicon solar cell was used to calibrate the light intensity. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the PSCs were measured using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.


Under an atmosphere of argon, n-butyllithium (3.1 mL, 1.6 M in hexane, 5.0 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of thiophene (347 μL, 4.4 mmol) in THF (20 mL) at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred at rt for 2 h. Compound 3 (888 mg, 2.0 mmol) was added and the reaction was kept at 50 °C for 1 h. Then the mixture was cooled to rt and a solution of tin(II) chloride dihydrate (1.8 g) in 10% of HCl (2.5 mL) was added. This mixture was stirred at rt for another 1.5 h and quenched by ice water. The mixture was then extracted with petroleum ether, dried by Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give compound 4 as a white solid (633 mg, 60.6%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.50 (d, 2H, J = 6 Hz), 7.43 (d, 2H, J = 6 Hz), 7.24–7.23 (m, 2H), 7.20 (s, 2H), 2.84 (t, 4H, J = 9 Hz), 1.70 (m, 4H), 1.37–1.23 (m, 20H), 0.86 (t, 6H, J = 9 Hz).


To a mixture of compound 4 (653 mg, 1.25 mmol) and anhydrous THF (15 mL), n-butyllithium (1.95 mL, 3.13 mmol, 1.6 M in hexane) was added slowly at −78 °C under an argon atmosphere. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and cooled to −78 °C. Trimethyltin chloride (3.8 mL, 3.8 mmol, 1.0 M in THF) was added dropwise. Then the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was poured into 100 mL of cold water and extracted three times with diethyl ether. The organic layer was separated and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed, and the crude product was purified by recrystallization from isopropanol to obtain the product as a light yellow solid (0.75 g, 66%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.56 (d, 2H, J = 6 Hz), 7.31 (d, 2H, J = 6 Hz), 7.24 (s, 2H), 2.84 (t, 4H, J = 6 Hz), 1.70 (m, 4H), 1.37–1.20 (m, 20H), 0.86 (t, 6H, J = 9 Hz), 0.44 (t, 18H, J = 30 Hz). 13C NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 147.2, 145.9, 138.6, 138.2, 136.2, 128.9, 122.6, 119.9, 31.8, 31.2, 31.1, 29.3, 29.2, 29.1, 22.6, 14.1, −8.0.

To a 25 mL round-bottom flask was added compound 5 (135.6 mg, 0.15 mmol), 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (82.5 mg, 0.15 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (4.1 mg, 0.0045 mmol), P(o-tol)3 (12.3 mg, 0.040 mmol) and anhydrous toluene (5 mL). The mixture was then degassed by argon for 30 min at room temperature. Then the solution was heated to reflux and stirred for 48 h under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was added dropwise into methanol. The precipitate was purified by the Soxhlet extraction method using methanol, hexane, acetone, and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was evaporated to obtain PVB1. Yield: 75%. Mn = 23.7 K, PDI = 1.53. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.79 (br, 2H), 7.63 (br, 2H), 7.44 (br, 2H), 4.30 (br, 4H), 2.91 (br, 4H), 2.08 (br, 4H), 1.76 (br, 4H), 1.54–1.25 (br, 44H), 0.85 (br, 12H).


The same procedure as PVB1 with compound 5 and 1,3-dibromo-5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione as the monomers. Yield: 83%. Mn = 28.5 K, PDI = 1.82. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.21 (br, 2H), 7.39 (br, 4H), 3.64 (br, 2H), 2.71 (br, 4H), 1.92 (br, 1H), 1.75 (br, 4H), 1.55–1.28 (br, 28H), 1.01–0.86 (br, 12H).


The synthetic route for monomer 5 is illustrated in Scheme 2. The three-component reaction of aldehyde, ethyl cyanacetate and sulphur yields compound 1, which is transferred to 2 by deamination and ester–amide transformation. The following procedures are similar to the synthesis of a normal BDT compound. Organotin compound 5 was purified by recrystallization from iso-propanol solution. The polymers of PVB1 and PVB2 were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling polymerization of 5 with alkoxyl substituted benzothiadiazole (BT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) dibromide, respectively. They are easily soluble in the solvents of chloroform, THF, chlorobenzene (CB). The molecular weights (Mn) of PVB1 and PVB2 are 23.7 K and 28.5 K, respectively, which are determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in THF relative to polystyrene standards (Table 1).

Thermal stability of the two polymers was investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI). The decomposition temperatures of PVB1 and PVB2 for a 5% weight loss are 336 and 451 °C, respectively (Table 1), indicating sufficient thermal stability for application in optoelectronic devices.

The absorption spectra of PVB1 and PVB2 are shown in Fig. 1 and the optical data are summarized in Table 2. PVB1 displays two absorption peaks at 375 nm and 517 nm in CHCl3 solution, which are red shifted to 386 nm and 539 nm in film. The optical band gap calculated from the film absorption onset is 1.99 eV. PVB2 shows the absorption peak at 488 nm in CHCl3 solution and 499 nm in film. The optical band gap is calculated to be 2.10 eV. These data show that PVB1 and PVB2 are typically wide band gap materials. There are only small red-shifts in films compared to in solutions (9 and 22 nm) and the absorption shapes are similar, which indicate that π–π stacking is very weak in solid states for both polymers.

Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of PVB1 and PVB2 as thin films with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. A ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system was used as the internal standard. The HOMO energy level was calculated from the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.41) eV, where the Eox is the onset of oxidation potential. According to the calculation, the HOMO levels of PVB1 and PVB2 are −5.51 eV and −5.64 eV, respectively. The low HOMO levels are in favor of achieving high Voc for devices. And these polymers should be stable under ambient air conditions. The LUMO level was estimated by the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg. So the LUMO levels of PVB1 and PVB2 are −3.52 eV and −3.54 eV, respectively, which can guarantee the charge separation between the polymer and the PC71BM. Compared to the formal BDT-TPD alternating copolymer, PVB2 exhibits a lower HOMO level and a large optical bandgap, which indicates the reduced electron donating ability of the vertical BDT unit. These data are also summarized in Table 2.


Photovoltaic performances of PVB1 and PVB2 were investigated in bulky heterojunction devices using PC71BM as the electron-acceptor material with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The active layers were prepared from chlorobenzene solutions of the polymer and PC71BM with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1. Spin-coating speed, thermal treatment parameters, the polymer/PC71BM ratio and the amount of of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive were evaluated to optimize the photovoltaic performance (Fig. S2, ESI). The efficiencies of both polymers increased with the reduction of polymer ratio in blend films. As a result, a blend ratio of polymer/PC71BM (1:4, w/w) shows the best performance (Fig. 3) and the data are summarized in Table 3. Under the illumination of AM1.5G, the devices of PVB1 showed a PCE of 2.84% with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 6.80 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.42. Annealing treatment of the active layer slightly improved the FF to 0.45, but the PCE was decreased to 2.64%. PVB2 showed a PCE of 2.05% with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 5.33 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.35 without using additive and annealing treatment. Comparatively, PVB2 exhibits a higher Voc than PVB1, which is ascribed to its deeper HOMO energy level (−5.64 eV vs. −5.51 eV).

External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of optimized devices based on PVB1 and PVB2 were measured and are shown in Fig. 4. The maximum EQEs are 46% and 40% for the devices based on PVB1 and PVB2, respectively. The current density obtained by the integration of EQE curves are well consistent with the Jsc recorded by J–V measurements.

The morphology of the active layer is very important for the efficiency of PSCs because it can greatly influence charge separation and transport. Atom force microscopy (AFM) was carried out in the tapping mode to study the blend film morphology. Fig. 5 shows the AFM images of optimized devices of PVB1:PC71BM and PVB2:PC71BM. The images showed a very smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.40 nm and 0.35 nm for PVB1 and PVB2, respectively. No distinct phase separation was observed for both films, which shows weak interchain interactions in the polymers and good miscibility between the donor and the acceptor, as indicated by the optical properties. This incomplete phase separation could not create a good percolating pathway for carrier transport, which is probably the result of low Jsc and FF in the PSC devices. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate the arrangement of molecules in solid films. No obvious diffraction signal was detected in the spectrum (Fig. S4, ESI), which indicates the amorphous structure of these polymers.


A vertical benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit was synthesized and applied to construct the donor–acceptor (D–A) type polymers PVB1 and PVB2 with 5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzothiadiazole and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as the acceptor unit, respectively. These polymers show a wide band gap of over 2.0 eV and a low HOMO level of below −5.5 eV, which is beneficial to increase open circuit voltage. The polymer solar cell (PSC) devices based on PVB1/PC71BM and PVB2/PC71BM showed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 2.84% and 2.05% with large open circuit voltages (Vocs) of 1.0 V and 1.09 V, respectively. The results indicate that the vertical BDT unit might be a promising building block for the construction of conjugated polymers with high open circuit voltage in PSC devices.
