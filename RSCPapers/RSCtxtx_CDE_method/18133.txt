MXenes, a class of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides, have a wide range of potential applications due to their unique electronic, optical, plasmonic, and other properties. Herein, we explore the use of the Ti3C2 MXene in organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). SnO2–Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposites with different contents of Ti3C2 (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 wt‰) were used as electron transport layers (ETLs) in low-temperature processed planar-structured PSCs. Mixing SnO2 with 1.0 wt‰ Ti3C2 effectively increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.23% to 18.34%, whereas the device prepared with pristine Ti3C2 as the ETL achieves a PCE of 5.28%. Photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results reveal that metallic Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets provide superior charge transfer paths, enhancing electron extraction, electron mobility, and decreasing the electron transfer resistance at the ETL/perovskite interface, and thus leading to higher photocurrents. This work proposes a new field of application for MXenes and a promising method to increase the efficiency of solar cells.

Since methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) was first reported as a light absorbing material by Miyasaka et al. in 2009, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received widespread attention. Owing to their appropriate bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, high charge carrier mobility, and low trap density, hybrid perovskites have great potential as efficient, low cost, large-scale, and flexible materials for photovoltaic technology. In less than a decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been improved from 3.8% to above 23%, making them competitive with other solar cells that have been developed for decades, and approaching the theoretical efficiency of 33.5%. Despite the high PCE, a number of challenges still remain, such as the limited electron extraction ability of the electron transport layer (ETL), the intrinsic instability of perovskites against the environment (e.g., moisture, air, heat and light), low-temperature processability, mass production, etc. To solve these issues and progress toward the practical application of PSCs, further research is needed.

In the architecture of PSCs, the ETL plays a significant role in suppressing charge recombination and rectifying the photocurrent. Many PSCs are based on meso-superstructures with mesoporous TiO2 as the ETL, which requires a high-temperature sintering process (>450 °C) and restricts its applications in large-area, flexible or wearable devices in spite of the high PCE. In contrast, PSCs with a planar-heterojunction configuration have more potential owing to their relatively easy and low cost fabrication resulting from the lack of a mesoporous TiO2 layer, where the perovskite layer is sandwiched between an ETL and hole transport layer (HTL). Recently, SnO2 has emerged as a commonly used ETL in planar PSCs due to its low-temperature processability (≤200 °C), superior electron mobility, and good optical transparency. SnO2-based PSCs also exhibit good stability in an ambient environment. Moreover, combining SnO2 with n-type semiconductors or high-conductivity materials has proven to be an effective way to further improve the ETL's electrical conductivity and electron mobility, and thus improve the PCE, highlighting that the SnO2-based ETL shows great potential for use in high-efficiency PSCs.
In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially graphene, have attracted great attention and have been used in PSCs due to their unique optical and electronic properties. To date, CH3NH3PbI3-based regular (n–i–p type) and inverted (p–i–n type) PSCs containing graphene oxide (GO) as the charge transport layer were reported to achieve PCEs of 18.19% and 13.8%, respectively. Reducing GO has proven to be an effective method to improve the conductivity of GO, and Yeo et al. reported the first reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based inverted CH3NH3PbI3 PSC, which reached a PCE of 10.8%. Recently, Jokar et al. further improved this system to exceed 16%. Therefore, it can be seen that conductive 2D materials have great potential for use in PSCs.
2D materials called MXenes offer a higher conductivity than rGO, while absorbing less light in the visible range. MXenes are 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides with a composition of Mn+1XnTx, where M is an early transition metal, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and Tx indicates the surface termination (usually oxygen- and/or fluorine-containing species). MXenes have shown outstanding performance when applied in supercapacitors, catalysis, conducting thin films, sensors, and antennas due to their high electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity, which enables processing from aqueous solutions. Interestingly, MXene-based electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells and MXenes as additives in the perovskite layer for PSCs were recently proposed. However, the applications of MXenes in solar cells still remain largely unexplored. Furthermore, MXenes have been reported to enhance the electrical conductivity of semiconductors. All this aroused our interest in applying MXenes as additives in the ETL to enhance electron collection in PSCs.
Herein, Ti3C2 (the most widely studied MXene) nanosheets were used as a conductive additive in the SnO2 ETL for low-temperature-processed planar CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. ETL films of SnO2 with different Ti3C2 contents (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 wt‰) were prepared by spin-coating the aqueous mixed SnO2–Ti3C2 colloidal solutions onto indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an ITO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag configuration. The results reveal that proper addition of Ti3C2 to the SnO2 layer can increase ETL conductivity, which is beneficial for higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) values. Compared with the pristine SnO2, the PCE of the SnO2–Ti3C2-based PSC was improved from 17.23% to 18.34%, achieved by addition of 1.0 wt‰ Ti3C2 to the SnO2 layer, under standard AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight illumination. The improvement of the PCE can be attributed to faster electron extraction, higher electrical conductivity and electron mobility in the ETL. In the meantime, the pristine Ti3C2-based PSC can also achieve a PCE of 5.28%.

SnO2 colloid (15 wt%, ∼5 nm) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, >99.5%), lead iodide (PbI2, >99.99%), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, >99.8%) and lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, >99%) were obtained from Xian Polymer Light Technology Corp. 4-tert-Butyl pyridine (tBP, 96%) was purchased from Macklin. Ultradry anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%) were obtained from Beijing Infinity Scientific (INFI). For the MAX phase synthesis, titanium powder and aluminum powder were purchased from Aladdin. Graphite was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.


First, the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase was prepared by mixing 7.368 g of titanium powder, 1.523 g of aluminum powder and 1.109 g of graphite together, and then sintering at 1650 °C for 2 hours under argon. The Ti3C2 MXene was prepared by etching Ti3AlC2 powder (≈400 mesh) in 12 M LiF/9 M HCl solution at room temperature, as described elsewhere. Briefly, 0.8 g of LiF was added to 10 mL of 9 M HCl under continuous stirring for several minutes. Then 0.5 g Ti3AlC2 powder was gradually added (over 5 min) to the etchant solution and continuously reacted for 24 h at room temperature. After that, the acidic mixture was washed with deionized water by repeated centrifugation (5 min per cycle at 8000 rpm). After each cycle, the supernatant was poured out and replaced with new deionized water until its pH > 5. Finally, the slurry was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 1 h. A dark-green colloid supernatant solution containing Ti3C2 nanosheets was obtained. To confirm the concentration of Ti3C2 dispersion, 10 mL of Ti3C2 dispersion was filtered over a cellulose membrane (0.22 μm pore size). After drying and weighing the peeled-off Ti3C2 film, the concentration of Ti3C2 was then calculated to be 3 mg mL−1.


The SnO2 hydrocolloid was diluted to the concentration of 3 wt% (30 mg mL−1) from 15 wt% by adding deionized water. Then the Ti3C2 dispersion was directly mixed with the SnO2 hydrocolloid according to the experimental ratios (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 wt‰), and was stirred for 5 min before use. SnO2–Ti3C2 MXene films were prepared by spin-coating 70 μL of colloids at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the ITO substrates in air.


The pre-patterned ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, alcohol, and isopropanol in a ultrasonic bath for 30 min in sequence, and then treated with UV ozone for 30 min. The ETL was prepared via spin-coating SnO2 or SnO2–Ti3C2 nanocomposites or Ti3C2 hydrocolloids onto the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s in air, followed by thermal annealing on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min in air and UV ozone treatment for 30 min. The samples were then moved into a glovebox filled with nitrogen, where a perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.3 M (242 mg) PbI2 and 1.3 M (83 mg) MAI in 408 μL DMF/DMSO (4:1 volume ratio) for 60 min. The perovskite layer was prepared by spin-coating its precursor solution (40 μL) at 5000 rpm for 30 s onto the ETL, and injecting chlorobenzene (350 μL) quickly onto the spinning film for 5 s during the spin-coating process. The obtained film was then heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The hole transport material, Spiro-OMeTAD, was dissolved in chlorobenzene (80 mg mL−1). Then, 10.5 mL of tBP and 15.5 mL of a Li-TFSI solution (510 mg Li-TFSI/1 mL acetonitrile) were added into the Spiro-OMeTAD solution. After 5 minutes of stirring, 25 μL of the solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The samples were left in the dark at room temperature overnight in dry air. Finally, a 60 nm thick Ag electrode was thermally evaporated on the top of Spiro-OMeTAD to assemble a complete PSC device.


UV/Vis absorption spectra of ETLs on the ITO were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer over the 300–900 nm wavelength range. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was measured on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrophotometer with excitation at 403 nm and the light from the perovskite surface. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained on a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 920). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 25 °C. The data were collected with a 0.02° step size (2θ) for 0.2 s. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of SnO2 and SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) were measured using an integrated ultrahigh vacuum system equipped with a multi-technique surface analysis system (VG Scienta R3000) with an excitation energy of 21.218 eV, and were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). A field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU8000) was used to acquire top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) nanocomposite was recorded using a JEM-2200FS (JEOL).


The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter measurement system with an AM 1.5G filter at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as calibrated using a reference monocrystalline silicon solar cell (91150 V Oriel Instruments). The effective area of the cell was defined to be 0.04 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured in air under short-circuit conditions using a Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, a filter wheel, and a monochromator. Monochromated light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and the photocurrents were measured using a lock-in amplifier. The setup was calibrated using a certified silicon reference diode of a known spectral response. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on the devices were carried out using a VSP multi-channel potentiostat (Biologic, France), under the standard AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight illumination at open-circuit potential with the frequency ranging between 1 MHz and 10 Hz. Z-View Analyst software was used to model the Nyquist plots obtained from the impedance measurements.


The Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets were synthesized by etching the Al layers from the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, as represented in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of Ti3AlC2 before and after 24 hours of etching. The most intense peak of Ti3AlC2 (104) at 38.9° 2θ disappeared, furthermore the (002) peak at 9.5° shifted to about 7°, confirming the topochemical synthesis of Ti3C2. Etching of Al layers and delamination leads to formation of Ti3C2 2D nanosheets, as shown in SEM and TEM images in Fig. 1c and d, respectively.

SnO2 hydrocolloids containing different amounts of Ti3C2 and pristine Ti3C2 dispersions are shown in Fig. 2a. Because the surfaces of both Ti3C2 nanosheets and SnO2 nanoparticles are negatively charged, they do not interact or self-assemble during mixing, and hence, the mixture forms a colloidal suspension in the aqueous medium. Obviously, the color of the colloids became darker along with increasing the concentration of Ti3C2 although the amount of Ti3C2 is very low (0.5–2.5 wt‰). For device fabrication, each suspension was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto ITO-coated glass substrates, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air to obtain ETLs. To investigate the crystal structures, XRD patterns of films spin-coated from SnO2, SnO2–Ti3C2 and Ti3C2 suspensions on the glass were collected (Fig. 2b). Because the concentrations of Ti3C2 in the nanocomposite samples were too low (1.0 wt‰) to expect visible peaks, the concentration of Ti3C2 was increased 30 times to increase the signal. As shown in Fig. 2b, Ti3C2 presents a peak at about 7°, corresponding to the (002) diffraction plane. This peak appeared in the SnO2–Ti3C2 diffraction pattern along with all peaks attributed to SnO2, confirming that the crystal structures of both Ti3C2 and SnO2, were maintained. This evidenced that the two materials do not undergo any chemical or structural change in the process and coexist in the composite film. Moreover, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image of SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) nanocomposites was shown in Fig. S1. SnO2 nanoparticles can easily be observed on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets, indicating successful mixing of SnO2 and Ti3C2.

In order to determine the potential of Ti3C2 to improve the performance of PSCs, devices with the architecture of ITO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag were fabricated, as presented in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the PSC device with the planar architecture. Fig. 3c provides a schematic energy-level diagram of each layer, where the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of SnO2 and SnO2–Ti3C2 nanocomposites are determined by UPS and UV-vis absorption data (see Fig. S2 and Table S1). Fig. 4a displays the J–V curves obtained for PSCs with SnO2, SnO2–Ti3C2, or Ti3C2 as ETLs. Table 1 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Fig. S3 shows the PCE histograms of SnO2-based and SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰)-based cells, where J–V parameters display a small standard deviation, indicating good reproducibility of devices. It is clear that, with the increase of Ti3C2 loading, the Jsc value continuously increases from 22.83 to 23.56 mA cm−2, accompanied by a positive effect on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and FF in some cases. The optimum performance was obtained with the Ti3C2 concentration of 1.0 wt‰, where Voc and FF reached a maximum, and the PCE went above 18%. We think that metallic Ti3C2 flakes function like conductive wires in the composite ETL and offer better electron transport paths, giving rise to more efficient electron collection. As a result, the Jsc increases continuously. However, despite the increasing Jsc value, the PCE dropped for a higher concentration of Ti3C2 (>1.0 wt‰), which was apparently due to reduced Voc and FF. In addition, the device with pristine Ti3C2 as the ETL demonstrated only 5.28% PCE.

The EQE spectra and integrated currents calculated from them for various ETLs (Fig. 4b) are in line with the changes in Jsc. The integrated current density from EQE curves for the pristine SnO2-based cell is 19.62 mA cm−2, and it is increased to 20.2 mA cm−2 for the device containing 1.0 wt‰ Ti3C2. The deviation between the integrated current from EQE and the actual measured Jsc values (Table 1) is about 10%, indicating good accuracy of our J–V measured values. Besides, the hysteresis of the reverse and forward scans of J–V curves is reduced from 17.4% for the device based on pristine SnO2 to 8.4% for that based on SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) (Fig. S4).
To gain insight into the possible reasons for the improvement of the PCE upon adding a little amount of Ti3C2, CH3NH3PbI3 films or devices based on SnO2, SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰), and Ti3C2 were selected and further investigated. The XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films were recorded and shown in Fig. S5a. Here, the CH3NH3PbI3 films were prepared on ETL films according to the previously reported one-step deposition method, as detailed in the Experimental section. The XRD result is similar to that previously reported. Fig. S5b–d show the SEM images of the perovskite layer based on ITO/SnO2, ITO/SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰), and ITO/Ti3C2, respectively. All the films were pinhole-free with a smooth surface and large grains, which is the basis for good device performance. Indeed, this implied that there was no significant effect of the perovskite layer on the difference in device performance. The enhancement in cell performance must be related to the ETL instead of the perovskite.
Fig. S6a displays photographs of SnO2, SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) and Ti3C2 films fabricated by spin-coating onto ITO. Both films of SnO2 and SnO2–Ti3C2 are transparent and there is little change in color between them. The film of Ti3C2 obviously became darker compared to that of SnO2 and SnO2–Ti3C2, as expected from the color of their suspensions. Fig. S6b–d show their magnified SEM images. The morphologies of the SnO2–Ti3C2 are similar to that of SnO2, both films are flat, uniform, and pinhole-free, suggesting that the corresponding PSCs are likely of the planar-heterojunction configuration. The results are in coherence with the UV-vis absorption spectra of the various films shown in Fig. 5a. Precisely, the curves of SnO2 and SnO2–Ti3C2 films are almost the same, while the Ti3C2 curve has slightly stronger absorption in the UV region (λ = 330 nm), indicating that the addition of Ti3C2 to the SnO2 layer does not affect the transmission of light.
To investigate the electron extraction abilities of different ETLs, the PL spectra of the perovskite absorber layer spin-coated onto ITO/SnO2, ITO/SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) and ITO/Ti3C2 substrates were measured, as shown in Fig. 5b. The PL quenching originated from electron extraction across the interface of CH3NH3PbI3/ETL. The PL signal at about 780 nm is assigned to the emission from CH3NH3PbI3. The ITO/Ti3C2/perovskite shows the highest PL intensity, indicating that the hole blocking ability of Ti3C2 is less effective, thus there is more carrier recombination occurring in this device. This can be attributed to the metallic nature of Ti3C2 whose work function is higher than the valence band edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 3c), the lowest PL intensity is obtained with the ITO/SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰)/perovskite sample. It is lower than that of the ITO/SnO2/perovskite, indicating that the addition of Ti3C2 successfully enhanced electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL and suppressed carrier recombination. Fig. 5c gives the TRPL spectra of perovskites based on different ETLs. The lifetimes of PL decay of SnO2, SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) and Ti3C2-based perovskites are 40.3 ns, 33.8 ns, and 42.7 ns, respectively. This is consistent with the steady-state PL results, further supporting the results from J–V curves and EQE spectra, and demonstrating that the addition of Ti3C2 to SnO2 significantly enhances the Jsc.
To investigate the changes in FF, which is related to charge collection and conductivity, determined by interfacial charge transfer, EIS characterization was done on the devices with the architecture of ITO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, where the ETL is either SnO2, SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) or Ti3C2, under the standard AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight illumination at 0 V relative to the open-circuit potential with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 10 Hz. Fig. 5d shows the Nyquist plots of the three devices which present semi-circles corresponding to the equivalent circuit model proposed. Here, Rs is the series resistance largely associated with wires and the ITO substrate. The observed major semi-circle represents the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) and interfacial capacitance (C) at the ETL/perovskite interface.Rrec is inversely proportional to charge recombination, in other words, a higher Rrec suggests lower carrier recombination (better hole blocking ability). The values fitted to the equivalent circuit are tabulated in Table S2. The value of Rrec follows the order SnO2 > SnO2–Ti3C2 > Ti3C2, where the larger resistance is favorable to higher electron collection. The Ti3C2-based PSC has the lowest Rrec, indicating that the most charge recombination occurred at the interface, and thus resulting in the lowest FF. This is consistent with J–V results. Despite that the PSC based on SnO2–Ti3C2 has a lower charge recombination resistance compared to SnO2, its Jsc and FF are larger than the SnO2-based device. This can be partly attributed to the better electron extraction due to the addition of Ti3C2, as reflected in the steady-state PL spectra.
Electron mobility of the ETL was evaluated by the method of space charge-limited current (SCLC) on electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/TiO2/ETL/BCP/Ag under dark conditions (Fig. S7). The highest electron mobility among the three ETLs was determined to be 2.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Ti3C2, almost triple that of SnO2 (7.52 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). Despite the high electron mobility of Ti3C2, it showed the least efficient electron extraction and the most charge recombination, as demonstrated by the steady-state PL and EIS results, resulting in its lowest Jsc and FF, and thus the lowest PCE. As Ti3C2 nanosheets have good conductivity, it is coherent that after introducing Ti3C2 in the SnO2 layer, the electron mobility was increased to 1.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the SnO2–Ti3C2 sample, which is about ten times higher than that of TiO2. The mobility results also effectively explain the increase in Jsc and FF values in the device based on SnO2–Ti3C2 compared to the one based on SnO2.
Apart from the increase of the PCE, the effects of adding Ti3C2 to the SnO2 ETL on device stability were also studied. Fig. S8 shows the stability results of PSCs based on SnO2, SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) and Ti3C2 as ETLs in ambient air (relative humidity ≈ 20%) without encapsulation at 25 °C, which were tested under the standard AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight illumination. Despite the pristine Ti3C2-based PSC showing a good stability within the first 192 h, an obvious reduction of the PCE occurred after 192 h. In contrast, PSCs based on SnO2–Ti3C2 and SnO2 exhibited similar good stability trends for 768 h. The SnO2–Ti3C2-based PSC just showed slightly increased and less fluctuating stability compared to the SnO2-based one, indicating that the addition of Ti3C2 had no negative impact on the device's stability. Moreover, after 700 h of storage, the SnO2–Ti3C2-based PSC retained about 80% of the initial PCE, demonstrating the excellent stability of this device.

Conductive Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets were prepared and nanocomposites of Ti3C2 and SnO2 were used as the electron transport layers for perovskite solar cells. Flat, uniform and pinhole-free films of SnO2 containing different amounts of Ti3C2 (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 wt‰) were prepared by spin-coating. A relatively high PCE of 18.34% was achieved using SnO2–Ti3C2 (1.0 wt‰) as the ETL with a device architecture of ITO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The variation of efficiency from cell to cell is smaller than that of graphene-based CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs with a regular configuration (15.42 ± 0.54%), highlighting the potential application of MXenes toward the development of low-cost solar cells. This high efficiency originated from excellent electron extraction, electron mobility and low interfacial charge transfer resistance of the SnO2–Ti3C2 layer, thanks to the high conductivity of the Ti3C2 MXene which provides charge transfer paths, as evidenced by the steady-state PL spectra, SCLC and EIS results. A PCE of only 5.28% was achieved using pristine Ti3C2 as the ETL. This work sets a milestone for incorporation of 2D MXenes into solar cells. Moreover, the fabrication of the low-temperature and solution-processed ETL offers prospective applications for flexible photovoltaic devices.
