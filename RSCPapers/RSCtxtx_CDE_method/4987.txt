In the past few years, the emergence of nonfullerene (n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS)) acceptors combining with the rational design of conjugated polymer donor materials has dominated the rapid development of highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). Relative to the traditional fullerene derivative acceptors, narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors with a fused ring core possess the advantages of strong absorption in the visible-near infrared region and tunable electronic energy levels. On the other hand, the anisotropic conjugated structures of n-OS acceptors make it more challenging to match them with conjugated polymer donors. Therefore, it is critical to rationally design conjugated polymer donors with complementary absorption and matching electronic energy levels with nonfullerene acceptors for realizing high performance PSCs. Here we review the recent development of state-of-the-art wide-bandgap conjugated polymer donor materials, including D–A copolymers with BDT (benzodithiophene) as the D-unit and BDD (1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione), FBTA (fluorinated benzotriazole) or quinoxaline as the A-unit, etc., for efficient PSCs based on narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. Our focus is mainly on the design strategies, chemical structure–property relationships, and photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors. We hope that this review article could contribute to better understanding of the design strategies of high-performance conjugated polymer donors for nonfullerene PSCs.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs), which have unique features of simple device structure, easy fabrication by solution-processing, and capability to be fabricated into flexible and semi-transparent devices, offer a promising renewable energy technology. Photovoltaic materials are the key components determining the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Recently, the development of narrow bandgap n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) nonfullerene acceptors has significantly boosted the efficiency of PSCs to over 15%. To match well with the merits of n-OS nonfullerene acceptors, rational optimization of polymer donor materials via molecular design, including complementary absorption and matching electronic energy levels etc., is critical for achieving high performance PSCs. This review article summarizes and discusses the recent research progress in high-performance conjugated polymer donor materials for PSCs with narrow-bandgap n-OS acceptors.


Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention as a renewable photovoltaic technology due to their unique advantages of easy fabrication by low cost solution-processing, light weight, and capability to be fabricated into flexible and semitransparent devices. Typically, PSCs are composed of a blend active layer of a p-type conjugated polymer as a donor and an n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as an acceptor, sandwiched between a positive electrode and a negative electrode, among which at least one electrode should be transparent (as shown in Fig. 1). The power conversion efficiency (PCE), device stability, and cost are the three critical factors determining the industrial application of PSCs. Currently, achieving high efficiency is the top priority for the research field of PSCs. The PCE of PSCs is proportional to the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) of the devices. Hence, building efficient PSCs should simultaneously maximize these three key parameters. From the view point of photovoltaic materials, Voc is positively correlated with the energy level difference between the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the acceptor material and the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) of the donor material, as shown in Fig. 1; Jsc is dependent on the light-harvesting capability of the photoactive layer, efficient exciton dissociation, which is driven by the offset of ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO (Fig. 1), and the charge carrier mobility; and the FF is determined by the charge transportation, which depends on the morphology of the blend film. Therefore, the high-performance photovoltaic materials of PSCs should possess the following properties: (1) broad absorption in the visible-near infrared (NIR) region (complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor materials in the visible-NIR region); (2) higher hole mobility for the donor materials and higher electron mobility for the acceptor materials; (3) matching energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials: the LUMO and HOMO levels of the donor should be higher than the corresponding LUMO and HOMO levels of the acceptor with energy differences (ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO) larger than the binding energy of the excitons, and the polymer donor should have a relatively lower-lying HOMO energy level for higher Voc; (4) suitable solubility of the donor and acceptor materials for solution-processing; and (5) suitable aggregation properties of the donor and acceptor materials to form nanoscale phase separation donor/acceptor interpenetrating networks. In addition, the molecular backbones of the photovoltaic materials should be co-planar with close π–π stacking (which refers to high crystallinity) in the active layer, for promoting efficient charge carrier transport. On the other hand, since PSC devices require out-of-plane transport, the active layer should form ordered π–π stacking with face-on orientation to achieve high charge carrier mobility. Besides, an appropriate domain size and purity within the exciton diffusion length scale are crucial factors to ensure efficient charge separation and suppress recombination in the active layer.

Since the publication of bulk-heterojunction PSCs based on a conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative PCBM acceptor in 1995, fullerene derivatives have been the most popular acceptors, and dominated PSC research for 20 years until 2015. Nevertheless, fullerene derivatives, mainly PCBM and PC71BM, have significant drawbacks of narrow and weak absorption in the visible region and difficulty of tuning the absorption and electronic energy levels. In recent years, fused ring core based n-OS acceptors have demonstrated great advantages over fullerene acceptors in easy tuning of their absorption and electronic energy levels, and the PCE of the PSCs based on narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors rapidly increased to 13–15% with the development of new conjugated polymer donor and n-OS acceptor materials.
To match well with the merits of n-OS acceptors, rational molecular optimization of polymer donor materials is highly desirable. For instance, wide bandgap polymer donor materials are demanded to complement the broad and strong absorption of narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors for realizing good photon-harvesting capability of the blend film in the visible and near-infrared region. In addition, considering the fact that only a small driving force (ca. 0.1 eV, even negligible in some cases) is needed for efficient charge separation in PSCs with nonfullerene acceptors, while the driving force is larger than 0.3 eV for efficient charge separation in fullerene based PSCs, the HOMO level of the polymer donor can be down-shifted more deeply in nonfullerene acceptor-based PSCs to get higher Voc. It should be mentioned that the reason why the charge transfer can be efficient in the n-OS acceptor system with negligible driving force is unclear at present. Hou et al. provided a reasonable explanation for the efficient charge generation for PDCBT-2F:IT-4F-based PSCs by taking the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) into consideration, that is, the intermolecular electric field between the donor with a negative ESP value and the acceptor with a positive ESP value is favorable for exciton dissociation, facilitating electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor. Besides, a favorable well-defined fibrillar network and face-on molecular packing orientation in the active layer are essential for efficient charge transfer (CT) and transportation in PSCs. Nevertheless, the anisotropic charge transfer characteristic of n-OS acceptors (in comparison with the ball-like fullerene derivatives with isotropic charge transfer) will bring a challenge for designing donor materials with appropriate molecular packing properties and crystallinity to achieve a favorable morphology of the blend film. Furthermore, it is critical to rationally adjust the energy offsets between the donor and the acceptor for reducing the energy loss (Eloss) of PSCs. Currently, most of the state-of-the-art PSCs still suffer from an obviously excessive amount of Eloss compared to high-performance inorganic semiconductor and perovskite solar cells, limiting the further improvement of PCEs. The minimum Eloss in PSCs is defined as Eloss = Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the lowest optical bandgap of the donor or acceptor materials in the blend film of PSCs (commonly it is the Eg of the narrow bandgap n-OS acceptor in nonfullerene PSCs). In PSCs, Eloss can be separated into two parts including the energy loss in charge generation (Eg − ECT) and that in charge recombination (ECT − eVoc), where ECT is the energy of the charge transfer state (Fig. 2). Therefore, minimizing the Eg − ECT offset is an effective approach to reduce the Eloss of PSCs. According to the classical Mulliken theory,ECT is close to the gap between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. Due to the easily tunable energy levels of nonfullerene acceptors combining with the small necessary ΔEHOMO for efficient charge separation in nonfullerene based PSCs, Eloss can be minimized by straightforward tuning of the value of ΔEHOMOvia chemical structure modification. It is worth noting that a negligible ΔEHOMO between the donor and the acceptor does not guarantee a small Eloss, as the energy loss in PSCs also includes charge recombination energy loss (ECT − eVoc) resulting from both radiative and non-radiative charge transfer state decay (Fig. 2). In the Shockley–Queisser theory, the maximum achievable Voc is limited by the unavoidable radiative recombination. The additional voltage (energy) loss by non-radiative recombination can be minimized for the active layer with CT states possessing significantly weaker non-radiative decay pathways. One possible way to reduce the non-radiative recombination is to develop photovoltaic materials with high electroluminescence quantum efficiencies.
In this review, we summarize and discuss the state-of-the-art conjugated polymer donor materials for high-performance PSCs based on narrow bandgap nonfullerene n-OS acceptors (the molecular structures of representative n-OS acceptors are shown in Fig. 3), aiming to provide a better understanding of the rational molecular design strategies to well address the above mentioned issues for high-performance PSCs. In the molecular design of high performance conjugated polymer donor materials, D (electron-donating unit)–A (electron-accepting unit) copolymerization (main chain engineering) and side chain engineering are the most important and efficient strategies. The absorption spectra, electronic energy levels and hole mobility (μh, related to the planarity and interchain interaction of the polymer main chains) of D–A copolymers can be tuned by selecting different electron-donating and electron-accepting units. Benzodithophene (BDT) is the most important electron-donating (D) unit in constructing high efficiency D–A copolymer donor materials with different electron-accepting (A) units. Therefore, we will introduce the polymer donor materials according to their A-units in the following. In addition, the electronic energy levels and interchain interaction of the polymer donors can also be tuned by side chain engineering such as with thiophene conjugated side chains, electron-withdrawing substituents (especially fluorine substitution) and alkylthio or alkylsilyl substitution, so the effect of side chain engineering will also be discussed in reviewing conjugated polymer donor materials.

In the molecular design of wide bandgap conjugated D–A copolymer donor materials to match with the narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors, weak electron-accepting units are preferred to copolymerize with the BDT electron-donating unit. BDD (1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione) is a relatively weak electron-accepting (A) unit, and the D–A copolymers based on bithienyl-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) and BDD demonstrated excellent photovoltaic performance in PSCs with narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors.

Hou et al. first designed and synthesized a BDTT–BDD copolymer PBDB-T (Fig. 4) for application as a donor material in PSCs in 2012. PBDB-T showed a strong temperature dependent aggregation effect with a reversible thermochromic property in solution. In 2016, Hou et al. used PBDB-T as a donor in PSCs with narrow bandgap n-OS ITIC (Fig. 3) as an acceptor. In comparison with the PBDB-T:PC71BM blend film, the PBDB-T:ITIC blend film showed a much broader absorption spectrum and more appropriate electronic energy levels with smaller ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO, which are beneficial to enhance the photon-harvesting capability and increase Voc or reduce Eloss of the devices. As a result, a higher ECT value of 1.50 eV (Eg − ECT = 0.09 eV) was found for the PBDB-T:ITIC blend, resulting in a lower Eloss. In addition, more balanced charge transport and granular aggregates of appropriate domain sizes were observed in the PBDB-T:ITIC blend. Benefitting from these advantages, the PSCs based on PBDB-T:ITIC demonstrated an outstanding PCE of 11.21% (Table 1), which is significantly higher than that of the PBDB-T:PC71BM based device (PCE = 7.45%) and was the highest PCE for PSCs at that time. Later on, PBDB-T was widely used as a donor material to blend with different narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors, and its photovoltaic performance was further exploited by the rational design of new n-OS acceptors. For example, Bo et al. developed an acceptor (namely IDTOT2F, Fig. 3) with two alkoxyl side chains at the central unit to blend with PBDB-T. The introduction of two alkoxyl chains on IDTOT2F can effectively achieve improved solubility and enhanced crystallinity with dominant face-on molecular orientation. Besides, the PBDB-T:IDTOT2F blend also showed ordered lamellar packing and appropriate domain sizes, enabling a promising PCE of 12.79% without any extra treatment (Table 1). Tang et al. reported an n-OS acceptor INPIC-4F (Fig. 3) which possesses strong near-infrared absorption, high crystallinity, and high electron mobility. The PBDB-T:INPIC-4F blend film exhibited strong face-on orientation with suitable phase separation, and high and balanced hole and electron mobilities, contributing to the high PCE of 13.13% for the PSC based on it (Table 1) with a Voc of 0.85 V and a low Eloss of 0.54 eV. The extremely low Eloss of the PBDB-T:INPIC-4F based device can be ascribed to the narrow bandgap of INPIC-4F (Eg = 1.39 eV) and the small ΔEHOMO (ΔEHOMO = 0.09 eV) between INPIC-4F and PBDB-T. Yang et al. designed a near-infrared absorption n-OS BTTIC (Fig. 3) with a narrow bandgap of 1.47 eV, a higher LUMO level, and a relatively low ΔEHOMO of 0.26 eV with PBDB-T. The blend film of PBDB-T as a donor and BTTIC as an acceptor exhibited high and balanced charge mobilities (μh = 8.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 5.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and favorable morphology with appropriate phase separation due to the weak crystallization of BTTIC. Thus, the PBDB-T:BTTIC based device achieved a high PCE of 13.18%, with a remarkable Voc of 0.904 V and a low Eloss of 0.57 eV (Table 1). Interestingly, replacing the conjugated thiophene side chains in the fused ring of BTTIC with stronger electron-donating oxyalkyl (BTOIC, Fig. 3) led to a narrower bandgap of 1.39 eV and an up-shifted HOMO level (the ΔEHOMO between BTOIC and PBDB-T was minimized to 0.09 eV), resulting in a lower Eloss of 0.53 eV for the PBDB-T:BTOIC based device. Due to the excessive crystallization propensity of BTOIC, the device based on PBDB-T:BTOIC showed a lower PCE of 10.96% compared to the PBDB-T:BTOIC based device, with a lower Voc of 0.862 V. Zhu et al. developed a new fused-ring n-OS ZITI (Fig. 3), and the blend of PBDB-T:ZITI also exhibited high and balanced charge mobilities (μh = 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.139 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the PBDB-T:ZITI blend showed favorable face-on intermolecular packing, which is beneficial for efficient charge dissociation and transport. As a result, a high PCE of 13.03% was obtained from the PBDB-T:ZITI based PSCs.

Side chain engineering was applied on PBDB-T for further tuning the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymer donor material. Owing to the d-electron accepting ability of the sulfur atom, the alkylthio chain shows a unique effect in down-shifting the HOMO level of the resulting polymers. The authors of this article introduced the alkylthio substituent on the thiophene conjugated side chain of PBDB-T and synthesized a D–A copolymer PBDB-TS (Fig. 4). PBDB-TS possesses a lower HOMO level than its alkyl chain counterpart PBDB-T, leading to a higher Voc of 0.92 V for the PBDB-TS:ITIC-based PSCs. Nevertheless, due to the lower FF of 0.647, the PBDB-TS based device showed a lower PCE of 9.85% (Table 1). Hou et al. attached a fluorine atom and alkylthio chains on the BDTT unit of PBDB-T to develop a new conjugated polymer donor PBDB-T-SF (Fig. 4), and they attached a fluorine atom on the terminal groups of ITIC to synthesize a new n-OS acceptor IT-4F (Fig. 3). The engineering of fluorine atom substitution in photovoltaic materials can simultaneously down-shift their HOMO and LUMO levels and enhance their inter/intramolecular interactions, which leads to improved crystallinity and hence improved charge transport. Due to the effect of fluorine substitution, PBDB-T-SF and IT-4F exhibited higher absorption coefficients and more ordered intermolecular arrangements than their counterparts PBDB-T and ITIC, respectively. By using PBDB-T-SF as a donor and IT-4F as an acceptor to fabricate PSC devices, a remarkable PCE of 13.1% was achieved, with Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 20.88 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.713 (Table 1). The results demonstrate the great potential in improving the efficiency of PSCs by rational molecular optimization of donor and acceptor materials.
Hou et al. introduced fluorine substitution on the alkyl-thiophene conjugated side chain of PBDB-T to synthesize a new polymer donor PM6 (Fig. 4) in 2015. PM6 showed a similar optical bandgap but a stronger π–π* transition peak and a deeper HOMO level than PBDB-T, ascribed to the fluorine substituent effect on the BDTT unit. In addition, the neat PM6 film exhibited strong π–π interaction and dominant face-on molecular orientation. In 2018, Zhang et al. used PM6 as a donor in PSCs with IT-4F as an acceptor to fabricate PSC devices. The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurement results revealed that IT-4F favored the crystalline order of PM6, leading to stronger π–π stacking diffraction of the blend film compared to the neat PM6 film. Besides, high and balanced hole and electron mobilities were observed in the PM6:IT-4F blend. As a result, the PM6:IT-4F based device demonstrated a high PCE of 13.5%, with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 22.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.725 (Table 1). PM6 also exhibited superior photovoltaic performance when blended with other narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. For instance, by using IDIC (Fig. 3) as an acceptor, which possesses higher conjugated planarity and electron mobility (μe = 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the analogue acceptor ITIC (μe = 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the PM6:IDIC blend showed high charge carrier mobilities and favorable phase separation morphology, leading to an encouraging PCE of 11.9% for the corresponding PSC without any extra treatment (Table 1). The GIXD measurement results indicate that the extra-treatment for the PM6:IDIC blend film with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) significantly enhanced the crystallization of IDIC to form an oversize domain size, resulting in poorer photovoltaic performance compared to the as-cast device. Moreover, a PCE of 11.3% can still be achieved from the device with an active layer thickness of 255 nm, suggesting its promising potential in practical application of the PSCs. Wang et al. reported a selenopheno[3,2-b]thiophene-based narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor SeTIC4Cl (Fig. 3) to blend with PM6. Benefitting from the matching absorption and energy levels, as well as the ordered lamellar molecular stacking with face-on orientation of the PM6:SeTIC4Cl blend film, an excellent PCE of 13.32% was achieved (Table 1). It is worth noting that recently Zou et al. designed and synthesized a narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor Y6 (Fig. 3) to blend with PM6; a champion PCE of 15.7% was obtained with a high Jsc exceeding 25 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 0.761 (Table 1).
A chlorine substituted analogue of PM6, PBDB-T-2Cl (Fig. 4), was reported with the merits of easier synthesis and higher efficiency. In comparison with the fluorine atom, the chlorine atom has a larger atomic radius and weaker electronegativity. On the other hand, since the chlorine atom has empty d-orbitals available for π electron delocalization, which can increase the electron density over the chlorine atom compared to the fluorine atom, chlorinated polymers show even deeper HOMO levels than those of the fluorinated counterparts. Theoretical calculation revealed that the replacement of fluorine with chlorine not only affects the molecular backbone conformation but also effectively down-shifts the HOMO level of the polymer. The lower HOMO level of PBDB-T-2Cl led to a higher Voc of 0.86 V of the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F based device compared to the device based on PM6:IT-4F (Voc = 0.84 V). On the other hand, although the PBDB-T-2Cl:IT-4F and PM6:IT-4F blends exhibited similar phase separation morphologies, higher Jsc and FF were achieved from the devices based on PBDB-T-2Cl (Table 1), delivering a higher PCE of 14.4%. In addition to the better photovoltaic performance, PBDB-T-2Cl also shows unique advantages of a simpler synthetic procedure and high product yield over its corresponding fluorinated polymer PM6. As shown in Fig. 4, the chlorinated compound 1 can be easily synthesized with a product yield of over 75% from 3-chlorothiophene, while the fluorinated compound 2 is prepared in four steps with an overall product yield of less than 15%. The results indicate that chlorination should be a promising molecular design strategy to reduce the material cost for scale-up synthesis of high performance photovoltaic materials.
The modification of the thiophene π-bridge in the main chain of PBDB-T is another effective method to tune its photovoltaic performance. For instance, Heeney et al. introduced fluorine substituents on the thiophene π-bridge of PBDB-T to develop a polymer PFBDB-T (Fig. 4). The fluorination on the thiophene π-bridge has a negligible effect on the extinction coefficient, while it leads to ∼20 nm red-shifted film absorption and a 0.14 eV down-shifted HOMO level of PFBDB-T compared to PBDB-T. As a result, a higher PCE of 11.71% with higher Voc and Jsc values (Table 1) was achieved from the PFBDB-T:ITIC based PSCs compared to the PBDB-T based devices. By replacing ITIC with C8-ITIC (Fig. 3), which has higher absorptivity and increased crystallinity as an acceptor, a notable PCE of 13.2% was realized in the PFBDB-T based PSCs (Table 1). The grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results revealed that the crystallization of both ITIC and C8-ITIC was weakened by PFBDB-T in their blend films, while the relatively better crystallinity of C8-ITIC (compared to ITIC) enabled improved molecular packing of the PFBDB-T:C8-ITIC blend compared to the PFBDB-T:ITIC blend, contributing to the improved Jsc and FF of the PFBDB-T:C8-ITIC based device. Interestingly, enhancing the crystallinity of C8-ITIC compared to ITIC favors the as-cast PBDB-T:C8-ITIC and PFBDB-T:C8-ITIC blends to realize an optimized bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology, so that the addition of a processing additive or thermal annealing did not further improve the PCE of the PSCs based on PBDB-T:C8-ITIC and PFBDB-T:C8-ITIC. Besides, the PSCs based on PFBDB-T:C8-ITIC exhibited a lower Eloss of 0.60 eV than the PBDB-T:ITIC based device (Eloss = 0.68 eV), which is mainly due to the smaller HOMO offset (ΔEHOMO = 0.16 eV) of the PFBDB-T:C8-ITIC blend compared to the PBDB-T:ITIC blend (ΔEHOMO = 0.31 eV). The results provide a promising strategy to design high-performance photovoltaic materials for as-cast PSCs by manipulating the crystallinity of the polymer donor and n-OS acceptor. Hou et al. introduced chlorine substituents on the thiophene π-bridge of PBDB-T with different chlorine orientation and synthesized two new BDD-based copolymer donors PCl(3)BDB-T and PCl(4)BDB-T (Fig. 4). The minor difference of the chlorine orientation in the thiophene π-bridges in the two polymers dramatically affects their absorption features and molecular aggregation. In comparison with PCl(4)BDB-T, PCl(3)BDB-T had a highly twisted conjugated backbone and lower crystallization, resulting in very poor intramolecular and intermolecular charge transfer and poor BHJ morphology in the PCl(3)BDB-T:IT-4F blend, which result in the extremely low PCE of 0.18% for the PCl(3)BDB-T:IT-4F based device. By contrast, due to the planar conjugated backbone of PCl(4)BDB-T, in combination with the well-balanced charge carrier mobilities and good phase separation morphology of the PCl(4)BDB-T:ITIC blend, the PCl(4)BDB-T:ITIC based PSC yielded a significantly higher PCE of 12.33% (Table 1).
In addition to the PBDB-T derivatives with thienyl-BDT as the D-unit, BDD based D–A copolymers with phenyl substituted BDT (BDTP) as the D-unit also showed good photovoltaic properties in PSCs with narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. Especially, there are five loci in the phenyl ring of BDTP for functionalization to manipulate the photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers. Zhang et al. introduced alkoxyphenyl or fluorinated-alkoxyphenyl on the BDTP unit to develop two wide bandgap BDD-based copolymers POPB and PFOPB (Fig. 4). Relative to POPB, PFOPB possesses a lower HOMO level, higher extinction coefficient, and higher hole mobility. GIWAXS measurements revealed that the two pure polymer films both displayed obvious lamellar peaks (100) in the in-plane direction and a strong π–π stacking peak (010) in the out-of-plane direction, while PFOPB showed a stronger π–π stacking peak (010) than POPB, indicating that fluorination in the meta position of the phenyl ring can enhance the crystallinity of the polymer. Moreover, the PFOPB:IT-4F blend exhibited better nanoscale phase separation, more appropriate domain size, and more preferred face-on molecular orientation than the POPB:IT-4F blend. The combined advantages of the PFOPB:IT-4F blend over the POPB:IT-4F blend led to a significantly higher PCE of 11.7% for the PSCs based on PFOPB:IT-4F (Table 1), while POPB:IT-4F only gave a moderate PCE of 6.2%. The results indicate the positive effect of fluorine substitution in improving the photovoltaic performance of polymer donors. An analogue of POPB, PBPD-Th (Fig. 4), with alkoxy chains on the meta-position of the phenyl side chain exhibited a larger optical bandgap (Eg = 1.91 eV) and slightly lower HOMO level (HOMO = −5.42 eV) than POPB (Eg = 1.81 eV, HOMO = −5.38 eV). The pristine PBPD-Th film showed strong crystallinity with predominant face-on orientation molecular packing, leading to a higher hole mobility of 1.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (higher than that of POPB, μh = 3.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). By using ITIC as an acceptor to blend with PBPD-Th, the PSC demonstrated a notable Voc of 1.01 V and a high PCE of 10.8% (Table 1), with a low energy loss of 0.54 eV. Huo et al. designed and synthesized three BDD-based D–A copolymers PTBB-o, PTBB-m, and PTBB-p with alkylthio substitution on different positions of the phenyl conjugated side chain of BDT as the D-unit (Fig. 4) for investigating the steric effect of alkylthio side chains on their optoelectronic properties and the balance between crystallinity and miscibility. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the steric structure in BDT of the polymers can be tuned by simply changing the orientation of the alkylthio side chains: PTBB-o has the larger steric structure, while PTBB-m has the middle and PTBB-p has the smaller one. Such steric structure influences the energy levels and polymer aggregation properties. Among the three polymers, the PTBB-o film showed the smallest bathochromic shift and the deepest HOMO level, while PTBB-p exhibited the largest bathochromic shift coupled with the sharpest shoulder peak and the highest HOMO level. The three polymer films exhibited preferential face-on molecular orientation but different crystallinity properties: PTBB-p had the highest crystallinity due to the weakest steric property, while PTBB-o with the most twisted backbone showed the weakest crystallinity. The different physicochemical properties of the three polymers result in significantly different photovoltaic performance when blended with ITCPTC (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Yang et al. reported two BDD-based D–A copolymers with alkylthio naphthyl or alkoxyl naphthyl substitution on BDT as the D-unit (PBDTNS-BDD and PBDTNO-BDD, Fig. 4). The alkylthio side chains play a critical role in tuning the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the polymer donors. As expected, the PBDTNS-BDD based PSCs demonstrated better photovoltaic performance over the devices based on PBDTNO-BDD (Table 1). Hou et al. proposed a molecular design strategy to develop polymer donors for high-performance PSCs processed by green solvent, that is, manipulating the flexible and conjugated side-chains of PBDB-T to improve the solubility and fine-tune the aggregation property of the target polymers (PBDB-T-BO and PBDB-BzT, Fig. 4) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). They found that the aggregation effect of PBDB-T in solution can be significantly weakened by extending the alkyl side-chains, and PBDB-T-BO exhibited little aggregation effect in chlorobenzene or THF. By enlarging the conjugated side groups of PBDB-T-BO, PBDB-BzT showed an enhanced aggregation effect in both chlorobenzene and THF. Thus, the PBDB-BzT:IT-M blend showed appropriate phase separation morphology in THF, resulting in a notable PCE of 12.10% for the PSC (Table 1). The results demonstrate a promising approach to manipulate the aggregation of polymers by molecular design.
BDD-based D–A copolymers with other D-units have also attracted attention for application as donor materials in PSCs with narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. Zhan et al. used BDD-based D–A copolymer PDBT-T1 (Fig. 4), which has an extended conjugated backbone compared to PBDB-T, to blend with IDIC, and the PSCs demonstrated a PCE of 10.37% with a notable FF of 0.732. Hou et al. synthesized two BDD-based D–A copolymer donors PBDD4T and PBDD4T-2F (Fig. 4) with bithiophene or fluorinated bithiophene as the D-unit, respectively. In comparison with PBDD4T, PBDD4T-2F with fluorination on the bithiophene unit showed a lower-lying HOMO level, stronger aggregation in solution and stronger π–π stacking in thin film, as well as higher hole mobility. By using ITIC as an acceptor to blend with PBDD4F-2F, the device yielded a PCE of 8.69%, which is significantly higher than that of the PBDD4T based device (PCE = 0.45%, Table 1). Such different photovoltaic properties between these two polymers are mainly due to the difference of the morphology and crystalline structures of the blends: poor morphology was observed from the PBDD4T:ITIC blend film, while the PBDD4T-2F:ITIC blend film showed clear and nanoscale fibrils, along with stronger and more compact π–π stacking, which is beneficial for facilitating intermolecular charge transport. The results demonstrate a feasible approach to tune the torsional barrier of the molecular plane and enhance the interchain π–π interaction of the polymers by fluorine substitution on the main chains.
An analogue weak A-unit of BDD, the naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione (NTDO) unit, also deserves attention for constructing high performance D–A copolymer donor materials. NTDO was firstly used as the A-unit for synthesizing D–A copolymer donor materials by the authors of this article in 2011. The NTDO unit possesses good planar structure and more loci in its top phenyl ring than the top thiophene ring of BDD for structure optimization. The substitutions on the NTDO unit show critical impact on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting polymers. Generally, the introduction of an electron-rich alkoxy substituent on the NTDO unit effectively weakens its electron-accepting nature, resulting in an up-shifted HOMO level and blue-shifted absorption spectra of the resulting polymers, while an electron-withdrawing substituent (such as fluorine atoms) on the top phenyl of NTDO strengthens the electron-accepting nature, and thus a lower HOMO and red-shifted absorption spectrum can be expected. Hou et al. reported two NTDO based polymer donors which have no substitutions on the top phenyl ring of the NTDO unit (PBDT-DTN and PIDT-DTN, Fig. 4). The two polymers have planar conjugated backbones, similar absorption spectra and similar energy levels. Due to the lower steric hindrance of the side group of PBDT-DTN compared to PIDT-DTN, PBDT-DTN showed enhanced intermolecular interaction, leading to different phase separation when blended with ITIC. The PBDT-DTN:ITIC blend formed a suitable nanoscale morphology for charge separation and transportation, while the PIDT-DTN:ITIC blend exhibited unclear phase separation. As a result, the PBDT-DTN:ITIC based PSCs showed a PCE of 8.3%, while the PIDT-DTN:ITIC based devices only gave a low PCE of 1.1% (Table 1). This example indicates that the aggregation of polymer donors significantly affects their photovoltaic performance. Very recently, our group attached alkylthio chains on the NTDO unit and synthesized a dialkylthio-substituted NTDO based polymer (PBN-S, Fig. 4) as a donor material for PSCs with narrow bandgap n-OS IT-4F as an acceptor. From the material synthesis point of view, using electron-withdrawing substitutions to functionalize the NTDO unit will lead to a very low product yield, since the NTDO unit is prepared by a Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction. Using alkylthio chains is a promising strategy to tune the physicochemical properties of NTDO based polymers in terms of easy synthesis and strengthening the electron-accepting nature of the NTDO unit. Hence, PBN-S possesses a low-lying HOMO level and strong absorption which match well with IT-4F. PBN-S exhibits great potential in high-performance PSC application; a PCE of 13.10% was realized in the PBN-S:IT-4F based PSCs, with a high Voc of 0.891 V, Jsc of 21.03 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.699 (Table 1). In addition, the PBN-S based device with an active area of 100 mm2 still demonstrated a notable PCE of 10.69%. The results indicate the great potential of PBN-S as a donor material for future PSC application.
In short, the D–A copolymer donors based on BDTT and BDD backbones exhibit unique features of complementary absorption and appropriate molecular packing and aggregation with various narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. Molecular modification (such as alkylthio chain engineering, fluorination, and chlorination) on the BDTT unit and thiophene π-bridge can potentially fine-tune their energy levels and crystallinity properties to well match with narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors for achieving superior photovoltaic performance. Among the D–A copolymers of BDTT and BDD, PM6 (or PBDB-TF) and PBDB-T are representative high performance polymer donors for PSCs with a narrow bandgap n-OS as an acceptor.

The fluorinated benzotriazole unit (FBTA) is another relatively weak A-unit for constructing wide bandgap conjugated D–A copolymer donors. In 2012, Min et al. designed and synthesized a FBTA based conjugated D–A copolymer donor with BDTT as the D-unit (J51, Fig. 5) which shows strong absorption in the wavelength range of 500–600 nm. Such an absorption feature of J51 is well matched with the absorption profile of the narrow bandgap n-OS acceptor ITIC in the visible and near-infrared region. In addition, in comparison with J50 without fluorine substitution, the incorporation of the fluorine atom in J51 effectively down-shifts the HOMO energy level of the polymer donor due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atoms, and enhances its interchain π–π interaction (strong intermolecular F⋯H hydrogen bonding and intramolecular F⋯S interactions), which increases the crystallization of J51 and thus strongly influences the BHJ phase separation in the blend active layers of the PSCs. Therefore, the J51:ITIC blend realized a better nanoscale-phase-separated interpenetrating network and more appropriate domain sizes compared to the J50:ITIC blend, resulting in a higher PCE of 9.26% for the PSCs based on J51:ITIC (Table 2). The results reveal that fluorine substitution is an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of polymer donor materials. Then, Li's group further tuned the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of J51 by side chain engineering, and synthesized a series of J51 analogues (J-series polymers) with different substituents on the thiophene conjugated side chain of the BDTT unit or on the BDT unit (from J52 to J91, Fig. 5), for studying the structure–property relationship of this series of D–A copolymers. Attributed to the electron-donating and d-electron-accepting ability of alkylthio chains, J60 and J61 showed ca. 10 nm red-shifted absorption spectra and 0.11 eV lower HOMO levels than J52. Although J60 and J61 displayed the same optical and electronic properties, pristine J61 and the J61:ITIC blend showed stronger interchain interactions and a shorter π–π stacking distance than J60 and the J60:ITIC blend, respectively, which are desirable for obtaining higher charge carrier mobility. The GIWAXS results reveal that the introduction of the alkylthio substituent enhanced the molecular π–π stacking interaction, while the linear alkylthio chains can reduce the steric hindrance and thus show tighter π–π stacking compared to the branched ones. The PSCs based on J52:ITIC only exhibited a PCE of 5.51%, while the J60:ITIC based device demonstrated a higher PCE of 8.97%, with a higher Voc of 0.91 V and a higher Jsc of 16.33 mA cm−2 (Table 2). Notably, an increased PCE of 9.53% was achieved from the PSCs based on J61:ITIC with an increased Jsc of 17.43 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.615 (Table 2). The replacement of ITIC with its isomer m-ITIC (Fig. 3) as an acceptor led to a higher PCE of 11.77% for the J61 based PSCs (Table 2), mainly due to the higher film absorption coefficient, large crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility of m-ITIC compared to ITIC. Yan et al. reported a new J-series polymer J61-F by replacing the thiophene π-bridge of J61 with a furan π-bridge. J61-F possesses a deeper HOMO level at −5.45 eV in comparison with that (−5.32 eV) of J61. The non-fullerene PSCs based on J61-F:ITIC exhibited a PCE of 8.24% with a higher Voc of 0.95 V, which benefitted from the lower-lying HOMO energy level of the J61-F donor material.

The introduction of trialkylsilyl substituent on the thiophene conjugated side chains of the BDTT unit is another effective approach to manipulate the photovoltaic properties (J71, Fig. 5). The silicon atom has unique potential in improving the planarity of the conjugated backbone, lowering the HOMO level, and enhancing the π–π stacking of conjugated polymers. As expected, J71 exhibited a lower HOMO level than its corresponding polymers with alkyl or alkylthio substituents (J52, J60, and J61), which is desirable for obtaining a higher Voc value. Strong diffraction peaks of the neat J71 film obtained from GIWAXS measurements indicate the semicrystalline structure and preferred face-on orientation of the J71 film. Importantly, the J71:ITIC blend also exhibited dominant face-on orientation and tight π–π molecular stacking. The PSCs based on J71:ITIC demonstrated a PCE of 11.41% with a higher Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 17.32 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.698. The very small ΔEHOMO of 0.11 eV between J71 and ITIC and high Voc of 0.94 V resulted in a relatively low Eloss of 0.63–0.65 eV. J71 also showed good photovoltaic performance when blended with other narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. For example, the PCE of the PSCs based on J71:MeIC (Fig. 3) reached 12.54% (Table 2). In comparison with the PSCs based on J71:ITIC (μh = 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 3.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the improved Jsc and FF values obtained from the J71:MeIC based device can be ascribed to their higher charge carrier mobilities (μh = 8.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 7.39 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the well-developed domain purity. The J71-based PSCs with n-OS SBT-IC as an acceptor also showed a higher PCE of 11.28%. The effect of the alkyl chain length and configuration of the trialkylsilyl substituents on the photovoltaic properties of J71 was systematically investigated. Bin et al. designed and synthesized four analogues of J71 with different alkyl chains in the trialkylsilyl substituents (J70, J72, J73, and J74, Fig. 5). The length and branched configuration of the alkyl substituents of trialkylsilyl significantly impact the film absorption coefficients, HOMO energy levels, and hole mobility of the polymers. Among the five polymers (J70–J74), J71 has the highest film absorption coefficient, while J74 showed the lowest one. Due to the hindrance effect of the large side chains on the polymeric backbone, the HOMO level down-shifted from J70 to J74 in the order of increasing the bulk size of the alkylsilyl chains, resulting in increased Voc of the PSCs. GIWAXS measurements indicate that the increase of the bulk of the alkylsilyl chains weakened the interchain interaction and enlarged the π–π stacking distance. The photovoltaic performance of the polymer donors was investigated by using m-ITIC as an acceptor. The J71 based PSCs showed the highest PCE of 12.05%, with the highest Jsc and FF values (Table 2). The higher Jsc and FF of the devices can be ascribed to the ordered molecular packing and stronger π–π interaction, higher absorption coefficient, and higher charge carrier mobility of the polymer with appropriate shorter and linear alkyl substituents in the trialkylsilyl groups. The results demonstrate the important effect of side chain engineering on the photovoltaic properties of polymer donors. Introducing two fluorine substituents on the thiophene conjugated side chains of the BDTT unit of J52 results in a new polymer donor J91 (Fig. 5). The fluorine substitution further down-shifted the HOMO energy level of J91 to −5.50 eV. Therefore, the Voc of the PSCs based on J91:m-ITIC reached 0.984 V, leading to a higher PCE of 11.63% (Table 2).
The replacement of the BDT unit of J71 with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]difuran gives a new D–A copolymer J81 (Fig. 5), which shows a slightly red-shifted absorption spectrum and slightly deeper HOMO level in comparison with J71. The J81 based devices with ITIC or m-ITIC as an acceptor afforded PCE values of 10.60% and 11.05% and a higher Voc of 0.95 V and 0.96 V, respectively (Table 2). Peng et al. reported two FBTA-based D–A copolymer donors PBDT-Se-TAZ and PBDTS-Se-TAZ (Fig. 5) with selenophene substituted BDT as the D-unit, which exhibited good complementary absorption with ITIC. Relative to PBDT-Se-TAZ, PBDTS-Se-TAZ showed higher crystallinity and a smaller π–π stacking distance, which should favor the charge carrier transport. The device based on PBDT-Se-TAZ:ITIC exhibited a PCE of 10.07%, with a Jsc of 17.52 mA cm−2 (Table 2). The positive effect of the alkylthio chains on PBDTS-Se-TAZ simultaneously improved the Voc, Jsc, and FF values of the PBDTS-Se-TAZ-based PSCs, delivering a significantly higher PCE of 12.31% (Table 2). In comparison with PBDT-Se-TAZ:ITIC, the PBDTS-Se-TAZ:ITIC blend exhibited a more uniform and bicontinuous network with well-developed nanoscale phase separation, which should favor more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in devices, and thus give rise to better Jsc and FF values. A wide bandgap polymer PBFZ-OP (Fig. 5), which was synthesized by copolymerization of the FBTA and meta-alkoxy-phenyl-substituted BDT units, showed complementary absorption and matched energy levels with n-OS ITIC. Importantly, the pure PBFZ-OP film and PBFZ-OP:ITIC blend both showed dominant face-on molecular orientation and strong face-on π–π packing. As expected, a higher PCE of 10.5% was achieved from the PSC device based on PBFZ-OP:ITIC (Table 2). An analogue polymer PBZ-m-CF3 (Fig. 5) with meta-trifluoromethyl-p-alkoxyphenyl substitution on the BDT unit showed a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum but higher extinction coefficient, lower HOMO level, and slightly lower hole mobility than PBFZ-OP, suggesting the positive effect of trifluoromethyl substitution in molecular optimization for donor materials. By using PBZ-m-CF3 to blend with ITIC as an acceptor, the PSC device yielded a PCE of 10.4%, with a high Voc of 0.94 V (Table 2). A successful molecular optimization conducted on a phenyl substituted BDT and FBTA based polymer is using the synergistic effect of fluorine and sulfur substitutions on the phenyl side chains of BDT to beneficially modulate the energy levels, charge transport, and molecular packing of the resulting polymer PBTA-PSF (Fig. 5), and a PCE as high as 13.91% was achieved in the PBTA-PSF:ITIC based device, with a remarkable Voc of 1.01 V (Table 2). Yang et al. reported a series of FBTA based polymers with asymmetric substitutions on BDT units (P1–P6, Fig. 5). They found that the different substitution on the asymmetric BDT unit barely affects the absorption profiles and slightly influences the energy levels of the polymers, while they showed significant impact on the bulk-heterojunction morphology. Compared to P1 and P2, the longer and more twisted rigid biphenyl side chains of P3 led to ITIC over aggregation in the P3:ITIC blend, resulting in a relatively lower Jsc and FF (Table 2). Furthermore, the three as-cast blend films (P1:ITIC, P2:ITIC, and P3:ITIC) trended to optimized phase separation and showed almost the same morphologies of the blend films with thermal annealing or additive treatment. The results indicate the importance of appropriate rigid conjugated side chains for forming a preferable morphology without any post-treatments. On the contrary, the films of the three analogous polymers P4–P6 formed large-size domains and need post-treatment to tune the morphologies of the blend active layers. The results provide a possible strategy to design polymer donors for highly efficient as-cast PSCs.
You et al. designed and synthesized a FBTA based medium-bandgap D–A copolymer donor FTAZ (Fig. 5) with alkyl-substituted BDT as the D-unit in 2014, which showed good photovoltaic performance when blended with PC71BM. In 2017, Zhan et al. used FTAZ as a polymer donor to fabricate PSCs with their n-OS acceptor INIC3 (Fig. 3), which shows complementary absorption, matched energy levels and matched mobility with FTAZ. Importantly, the FTAZ:INIC3 blend exhibited face-on oriented domains with favorable nanoscale phase separation and appropriate aggregation sizes, delivering a high PCE of 11.5% for the PSC based on FTAZ:INIC3 (Table 2). By using IDIC (Fig. 3) as an acceptor to blend with FTAZ, complementary absorption, matched energy levels, and pure phase separation on the exciton diffusion length scale were observed in the blend, leading to a higher PCE of 12.5% (Table 2). Bin et al. reported a FBTA based D–A copolymer J40 (Fig. 4) with alkoxy substituted BDT as the D-unit, and a moderate PCE of 6.48% was obtained from the device using J40 as a donor and ITIC as an acceptor (Table 2). In 2017, Yan et al. synthesized a wide bandgap FBTA-based D–A copolymer PvBDTTAZ (Fig. 5) with BDT as the D-unit copolymerized on its central benzene position for application as a donor in PSCs. Although the neat PvBDTTAZ polymer and n-OS acceptor O-IDTBR (Fig. 3) both showed high crystallinity, the PvBDTTAZ:O-IDTBR blend can maintain their own lamellar and π–π stacking within small domains, enabling high charge carrier mobilities (μh = 7.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). As a result, a PCE as high as 11.6% was obtained from the PvBDTTAZ:O-IDTBR based PSCs, with a notable Voc of 1.08 V (Table 2). Thanks to the high Voc of 1.08 V and the very low ΔEHOMO of 0.04 eV between PvBDTTAZ and O-IDTBR, an extremely low Eloss of 0.55 eV was observed in the PvBDTTAZ:O-IDTBR based device.
In addition to the BDT D-unit mentioned above, other D-units were also used in fabricating FBTA-based D–A copolymer donors for PSCs with a narrow bandgap n-OS as an acceptor. Yan et al. designed and synthesized two FBTA-based D–A copolymers PTFB-P and PTFB-O (Fig. 5) with thiophene–bifluorophenylene–thiophene as the D-unit, and the two polymers showed strong temperature-dependent aggregation. PTFB-P and PTFB-O have nearly identical chemical structures except for a minor difference in the fluorination position on the central phenyl unit. Nevertheless, significantly different morphologies were observed in the PTFB-P:ITIC and PTFB-O:ITIC blends. PTFB-P with stronger crystalline characteristics cannot maintain its crystallinity in the PTFB-P:ITIC blend, while the less crystalline polymer PTFB-O formed smaller domains and higher photoluminescence quenching when blended with ITIC. Therefore, the devices based on PTFB-P and PTFB-O exhibited very different photovoltaic performance (Table 2). Yan et al. synthesized another two FBTA-based D–A copolymers PT4FB and PTT4FB (Fig. 5) with tetrafluorobenzene as the D-unit. PT4FB and PTT4FB have similar absorption profiles and energy levels, but significantly different polymer aggregation properties: PT4FB exhibited excessive aggregation and thus the PT4FB:IDIC blend formed large fiber-like domains, resulting in a moderate PCE of 9.81% (Table 2), while PTT4FB exhibited reduced molecular packing and crystallinity, and the PTT4FB:IDIC blend formed significantly smaller domain sizes, contributing to a higher PCE of 10.60% (Table 2). Chen et al. designed and synthesized two FBTA based D–A copolymers PB24-3TDC and PB68-3TDC (Fig. 5) with ester-substituted trithiophene as the D-unit and different length alkyl side chains on the FBTA unit. The chain length of the alkyl substituents on the FBTA unit effectively influenced the HOMO levels and crystallization of the polymers. The polymer PB24-3TDC with the shorter alkyl substituent possessed a higher HOMO level while higher crystallinity than the PB68-3TDC counterpart. In addition, the PB24-3TDC:ITIC blend exhibited more ordered intermolecular π–π stacking than PB68-3TDC:ITIC, which is beneficial for efficient charge transfer. Hence, very different photovoltaic performance was obtained from the PSCs based on these two polymers: the PSCs based on PB24-3TDC yielded a higher PCE of 10.3%, with a higher Jsc of 16.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.68, while the PB68-3TDC based device showed a lower PCE of 7.88% but a higher Voc of 0.994 V (Table 2).
Huang et al. developed an imide-functionalized benzotriazole as the A-unit, which was motivated by the fact that imide-functionalized units can potentially lead to preferable charge carrier mobility. By copolymerizing the imide-functionalized benzotriazole unit with the BDTT or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit, two wide-bandgap polymers PTzBI and PTzBI-DT were obtained, respectively (Fig. 5). PTzBI and PTzBI-DT showed complementary absorption and appropriate energy levels matching with the ITIC acceptor. Compared to PTzBI, PTzBI-DT with extended conjugation shows a slightly down-shifted HOMO level and enhanced crystallinity. Although the PTzBI-DT:ITIC blend film exhibited both higher hole and electron mobility (μh = 3.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the PTzBI:ITIC blend (μh = 0.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 0.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), dramatically increased aggregation was observed in the PTzBI-DT:ITIC blend, which is unfavorable for the photovoltaic performance. As a result, the PSC based on PTzBI-DT:ITIC demonstrated a higher PCE of 10.24% than the device based on PTzBI:ITIC (PCE = 9.43%, Table 2). The results suggest the potential of imide-functionalized units in designing wide bandgap polymer donor materials to match with narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptors for high performance PSCs. Guo et al. reported two polymers which feature a D–A1–D–A2 type backbone (PhI-ffBT and ffPhI-ffBT, Fig. 5) as donor materials. Due to the planar backbones and intense intermolecular attraction, the two polymers both showed strong aggregation properties. The ffPhI-ffBT neat film displayed a predominant edge-on orientation, while the neat PhI-ffBT polymer adopted both face-on and edge-on orientation, indicating that the introduction of fluorine atoms into the polymeric backbones led to increased edge-on orientation in this case. Relative to the ffPhI-ffBT:IT-4F blend, the PhI-ffBT:IT-4F blend film exhibited tighter π–π stacking, which is beneficial for obtaining high charge transport, and higher FF and Jsc values of the devices. Notably, the PhI-ffBT based PSC device yielded a remarkable PCE of 13.31% with a promising FF of 0.76 (Table 2). The results indicate that the D–A1–D–A2 strategy could be an effective way to design highly efficient polymer donors for PSCs.

Quinoxaline with an N-heterocycle is another moderate electron-accepting (A) unit that is widely used in constructing wide bandgap conjugated D–A copolymer donor materials for PSCs. Recently, many state-of-the-art quinoxaline based polymer donors have been developed for nonfullerene PSCs. An exciting example of a high-performance and low cost polymer donor material is the development of PTQ10 (Fig. 6). PTQ10 has a simple molecular structure with D–A copolymerization of a fluorine substituted quinoxaline A-unit and a thiophene D-unit, and a high overall product yield of 87.4% with only two synthetic steps from the commercial intermediate (Fig. 6). PTQ10 possesses a deep HOMO energy level of −5.54 eV and complementary absorption with narrow bandgap n-OS acceptor IDIC. Furthermore, the PTQ10:IDIC blend favors formation of face-on orientation, close π–π stacking, and high crystallinity after optimization. As a result, a high PCE of 12.70% was realized from the PSCs with PTQ10 as a donor and IDIC as an acceptor, along with a high Voc of 0.969 V (Table 3), benefitting from the deep HOMO level of PTQ10. In addition, the PTQ10 based PSCs exhibited insensitivity to the active layer thickness; a PCE as high as 11.59% can still be obtained even if the active layer thickness is 210 nm. In addition, PTQ10 also shows high photovoltaic performance in PSCs with other narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors, for example, the PCE reached 13.46% with MO-IDIC-2F as an acceptor (Table 3). The notable advantages of high photovoltaic performance and low cost of PTQ10 indicate the great potential for commercial application in PSCs.

Hou et al. developed three quinoxaline based D–A copolymers PQ-0F, PQ-QF, and PQ-4F with BDTT as the D-unit (Fig. 6). By introducing fluorine substituents on the BDTT and quinoxaline units, the energy levels of the polymers were effectively manipulated: PBQ-0F without fluorine substitution has the highest LUMO and HOMO levels, while PBQ-4F with fluorine substitution both on BDTT and quinoxaline possesses the lowest LUMO and HOMO levels. Regarding the molecular packing, the three neat polymers showed similar scattering profiles with preferred face-on packing and nearly identical laminar and π–π stacking peaks, indicating that the fluorine substituents on the BDTT and the quinoxaline unit barely affect the molecular packing of these polymers, while different molecular packing was observed when blended with ITIC, that is, PBQ-4F:ITIC exhibited larger integrated π–π intensity and thus has the most beneficial packing for obtaining high photovoltaic performance than the other two blends. Furthermore, both higher hole and electron mobilities were observed in the PBQ-4F:ITIC blend than in the PBQ-0F:ITIC and PBQ-QF:ITIC blends. Among the three polymers, the PBQ-4F:ITIC based PSCs yielded the highest PCE of 11.34%, resulting from the overall improved Voc, Jsc, and FF values (Table 3). It is worth noting that a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PQ-4F:ITIC device was achieved, in spite of the fact that the HOMO energy level offset between PQ-4F and ITIC is only 0.04 eV. The side chain substitution on the quinoxaline unit plays an important role in tuning the photovoltaic performance of the resulting polymers. For instance, the device based on PffQx-T (Fig. 6) exhibited a moderate PCE of 8.47%. By replacing the alkoxy substituted fluorobenzene on the quinoxaline of PffQx-T with alkyl substituted fluorothiophene, the PCE of the polymer TTFQx-T1 (Fig. 6) based device was improved to 10.52%, with overall higher Voc, Jsc, and FF values (Table 3). HFQx-T (Fig. 6), which has two additional fluorine substituents on the phenyl side chains compared to PffQx-T (HOMO = −5.36 eV), exhibited nearly the same optical bandgap but a lower HOMO of −5.45 eV. As expected, a higher Voc of 0.92 V was obtained from the HFQx-T based device, along with a higher PCE of 9.40% compared to the device based on PffQx-T (Table 3). Guo et al. designed and synthesized a series of quinoxaline based D–A copolymers with various numbers of fluorine substituents on their phenylene D-unit (P7–P10, Fig. 6). They found that the fluorination on phenylene significantly affected the energy levels, molecular packing, and film morphology of the polymers. The HOMO levels of P7–P10 were effectively down-shifted from −5.17 to −5.68 eV with increasing the fluorine atoms on phenylene. On the other hand, the conjugated backbone tended to better planarity with an increasing number of fluorine substituents on the phenylene moiety from P7 to P9, enabled by the F⋯H and F⋯S interactions. Relative to the P7:IDIC blend, the introduction of one or two fluorine atoms in the polymeric backbones substantially enhanced the hole and electron mobilities of the P8:IDIC and P9:IDIC blends. The backbone planarity variation is in accordance with the crystallinity of the polymers. Among the four polymers, P9 exhibited the more suitable energy levels with the IDIC acceptor and more planar backbone, contributing to the highest PCE of 9.70%, with a notable Voc of 1.00 V (Table 3). Peng et al. developed two D–A copolymers PBDT-NQx and PBDTS-NQx (Fig. 6) with fused quinoxaline as the A-unit and BDTT as the D-unit. The two polymer donors exhibited good photovoltaic performance when blended with the ITIC acceptor. In particular, the PSCs based on PBDTS-NQx with alkylthio substituents yielded a higher PCE of 11.47% than the PBDT-NQx based device, resulting from the overall higher Voc, Jsc, and FF values (Table 3).
As discussed above, the quinoxaline unit with moderate electron-deficiency is a good candidate as the A-unit in designing high performance D–A copolymer donor materials for nonfullerene PSCs. In particular, quinoxaline can provide four positions on its top and bottom phenylene ring for side chain substitution, which enriches the ways to modify the molecular structure for further improving the photovoltaic performance of the resulting polymer donors.

Fluorine substituted benzothiadiazole (BTF) is a strong electron-deficient unit for constructing low bandgap polymer donors with deep HOMO levels. The D–A copolymers based on BTF or benzothiadiazole (BT) as the A-unit are widely used as donor materials in PSCs with fullerene derivatives as an acceptor, while some BTF-based D–A copolymers also show good photovoltaic performance in nonfullerene PSCs, benefitting from their lower HOMO energy levels. In 2014, Yan et al. synthesized a BTF-based D–A copolymer PffBT4T-2OD (Fig. 7a) with oligothiophene as the D-unit. PffBT4T-2OD exhibited a strong temperature dependent aggregation property (Fig. 7a), which offered the possibility to control its crystallization and π–π stacked polymer domains during the solution processing step (Fig. 7a). In 2016, McCulloch et al. used PffBT4T-2OD as a donor and n-OS acceptor O-IDTBR (Fig. 3) as an acceptor to fabricate nonfullerene PSCs, and a high PCE of 9.95% was achieved, along with a remarkably high Voc of 1.07 V (Table 3). The high Voc is closely related with the low non-geminate and non-radiative recombination losses in the devices. They also synthesized a polymer donor PffBT4T-2DT (Fig. 7b), which is an analogue of PffBT4T-2OD, and the PSCs based on PffBT4T-2DT as a donor and narrow-bandgap n-OS EH-IDTBR (Fig. 3) as an acceptor demonstrated a higher PCE of 11.1% (Table 4). In particular, the PffBT4T-2DT:EH-IDTBR based PSCs processed with non-halogen solvent mesitylene exhibited better and more reproducible photovoltaic performance than the devices processed with chlorobenzene, due to a hot solution and substrate being required to ensure the crystallinity of the polymer lamellar stacking for the chlorobenzene-processed PffBT4T-2DT:EH-IDTBR blend. Yan et al. further optimized the molecular structure of PffBT4T-2DT by inserting benzene units into the backbone to develop an analogue polymer PffBT4T-B (Fig. 7b). Generally, inserting a benzene ring into the backbone of thiophene-based polymers would significantly twist the conjugated backbone, resulting in poorer photovoltaic performance, while, in this case, the PffBT4T-B based device yielded dramatically improved photovoltaic performance over the PffBT4T-2DT based device (Table 4), benefitting from the deeper HOMO level of PffBT4T-B and the more favorable morphology of PffBT4T-B:ITIC-Th. A BTF-based polymer PffBT4T-TT (Fig. 7b) was also developed as a donor to blend with O-IDTBR. PffBT4T-TT showed the same optical bandgap as and similar energy levels to O-IDTBR, indicating that the driving forces for hole and electron transfer are very small for the PSCs based on PffBT4T-TT:O-IDTBR. Even so, a high external quantum efficiency of 67% can still be achieved in the PffBT4T-TT:O-IDTBR based PSC. The device exhibited an encouraging PCE of 10.4% with a high Voc of 1.08 V (Table 4) and a small energy loss (Eloss) of 0.55 eV. The low Eloss of the device is mainly due to the negligible Eg − ECT value and a minimized non-radiative energy loss. The results indicate that efficient charge generation with small LUMO and HOMO energy offsets can be realized in nonfullerene PSCs.

Apart from the D–A copolymers mentioned above, conjugated polymers with electron-donating backbones and electron-withdrawing substituents can also be used as a donor in PSCs with narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors, because these polymers generally exhibit large optical bandgaps with strong absorption in the wavelength region of 500–600 nm, which is matched with the absorption feature of narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors. In addition, the HOMO energy level of the polymers can be downshifted by attaching electron-withdrawing substituents. Considering the fact that polythiophene derivatives have unique merits of a simple molecular structure and easy synthesis, polythiophene derivatives should be regarded as promising low-cost materials for PSCs. Hou et al. used an alkoxycarbonyl-substituted polythiophene derivative PDCBT (Fig. 8) as a polymer donor to fabricate PSCs with ITIC as an acceptor, and an impressive PCE of 10.16% was realized (Table 5). The good photovoltaic performance results from the complementary absorption, well-matched energy levels, and suitable nanoscale morphology of the PDCBT:ITIC blend.

A variety of copolymers based on the BDTT or BDT unit and the thiophene or oligothiophene unit with electron-withdrawing substituents were also synthesized for application as donor materials in nonfullerene PSCs. Park et al. copolymerized alkoxycarbonyl-substituted thiophene with the BDTT unit to develop a wide bandgap copolymer 3MT-Th (Fig. 8), which exhibited good photovoltaic performance when blended with ITIC (Table 5). Chen et al. reported two copolymers PBDT-2TC and PBDT-S-2TC based on BDTT and bithiophene with an alkoxycarbonyl substituent (Fig. 8), which have an extended thiophene unit in the conjugated backbone compared to 3MT-Th. The two polymers show slightly red-shifted absorption spectra compared to 3MT-Th, due to the extended thiophene unit in their polymer backbone. On the other hand, the alkylthio side chain on the BDTT unit of PBDT-S-2TC effectively down-shifted the HOMO energy level and improved its photovoltaic performance compared to the alkyl chain based analogue PBDT-2TC (Table 5). Hou et al. modified the molecular structure of PBDT-S-2TC by attaching two alkoxycarbonyl substituents on its bithiophene unit and synthesized two polymers of PB3T and PB2T (Fig. 8). PB3T shows a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum and downshifted HOMO energy level compared to that of PBDT-S-2TC. Interestingly, the orientation of the two alkoxycarbonyl substituents played a critical role in determining the backbone conformation, energy levels, molecular packing, and thus the photovoltaic performance of the resulting polymers. PB2T has a highly twisted backbone conformation, resulting in blue-shifted absorption and a lower HOMO level than PB3T. The PB3T:IT-M (Fig. 3) blend exhibited a similar hole mobility to neat PB3T, while the hole mobility of the PB2T:IT-M blend is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of the pristine PB2T film. The results suggest that blending with IT-M barely disrupts the crystallinity or interchain packing of PB3T but substantially distorts that of PB2T. The GIWAXS results further confirmed that the PB3T:IT-M blend exhibited higher crystallinity, more ordered molecular packing and predominant face-on orientation compared to the PB2T:IT-M blend. The PSCs based on PB3T:IT-M demonstrated a higher PCE of 11.7%, while the PB2T based device exhibited very poor photovoltaic performance (Table 5). Hou et al. further optimized the molecular structure of PB3T by synergistically fluorinating on the BDTT unit and tuning the alkyl chains of the ester, and synthesized three new polymers P11, P12 and P13 (Fig. 8). The fluorine substitution on the BDTT unit can guarantee the deep HOMO levels of the polymers, and the different alkyl chains of the ester group can modulate the aggregation and molecular packing properties of the polymers. The three polymers exhibited identical absorption spectra and similar energy levels, while P12 with a linear decyl alkyl chain showed stronger interchain π–π interaction. The GIWAXS results reveal that the linear side-chain substituted polymer was more favorable for forming close packing when blended with IT-4F, and the P12:IT-4F blend exhibited the highest π–π stacking among the three blends, indicating the higher ordering of aggregates in the blend. Therefore, the P12:IT-4F based PSCs demonstrated the highest PCE of 14.2% with a notable FF of 0.76 (Table 5).
Other than the carboxylate substituents, fluorine was also used as an electron-withdrawing substituent on the thiophene unit to construct copolymers based on BDTT and the thiophene or bithiophene unit. Beaujuge et al. developed three copolymers of BDT or BDTT and thiophene without or with bifluorine substitution (P14, P15, and P16, Fig. 8). They found that the fluorine substitution on the thiophene unit significantly affected the photovoltaic properties of the polymers: the PSCs based on P15 with fluorine substitution as a donor and ITIC as an acceptor exhibited overall improved photovoltaic performance (PCE = 5.8%) compared to that (PCE = 2.5%) of the PSCs based on P14 without fluorine substitution (Table 5), which results from the improved charge generation and collection efficiency, as well as reduced geminate recombination and bimolecular recombination of the fluorinated P15 system. Notably, replacing the BDT of P15 with the BDTT unit in P16 led to a significantly improved PCE of 9.8%, with a higher Jsc of 16.9 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.62 (Table 5). Li et al. synthesized three copolymers of BDTT and bithiophene with different alkyl or fluorine substitution, P17, P18, and P19 (Fig. 8), for application as donor materials in nonfullerene PSCs. Among the three polymers, the P17 film has the highest hole mobility of 0.79 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the P19 film exhibits the lowest one of 0.022 cm2 V−1 s−1. The low hole mobility of P18 and P19 with longer side-chains may originate from a change of molecular packing from edge-on to face-on orientation. As a result, the P17:ITIC based PSCs afforded the highest PCE of 8.7% among the three polymer donors (Table 5).

In summary, we have summarized and discussed several kinds of conjugated polymer donor materials for nonfullerene PSCs based on narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors, to provide a guideline to understand the relationship between the molecular structures and photovoltaic properties. In the past few years, the emergence of narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors combining with matching polymer donor material innovation has significantly promoted the development of PSCs. Several molecular design strategies (such as fluorination, chlorination, and alkylthio side chain engineering) have been successfully developed to precisely optimize the molecular structures of the polymer donors for achieving high power conversion efficiency. It can be expected that the efficiency of PSCs will be further boosted by simultaneously optimizing the molecular structures of the polymer donors and the n-OS acceptors.

In spite of the great achievements, challenges still remain for the practical application of PSCs, which needs further improved PCEs, reduced cost of the photovoltaic materials and increased stability of the devices. For further increasing the PCE, it is crucial to understand more in-depth the correlation between Eloss and the molecular structures of the photovoltaic materials, for instance, we need to understand what are the key properties of the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer that can give low non-radiative recombination rates and can realize low Eloss. On the other hand, although relatively lower Eloss values have been reported in some cases as mentioned above, the low Eloss devices often show lower Jsc or lower FF values. Thus, it is critical to design photovoltaic materials which can simultaneously realize high Jsc, high FF and high Voc values with low Eloss, affording high PCEs. In addition, morphology control plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. To realize high efficiencies, most of the state-of-the-art PSCs currently rely heavily on extra treatments of their active layers with solvent additives, solvent annealing and temperature annealing etc., which will lead to serious challenges in the fabrication of large-area PSCs. The morphology of the active layer is affected by various factors, such as the solubility, crystallinity, and miscibility of the donor and acceptor materials and the film formation conditions, etc. Therefore, understanding the inherent properties of the donor and acceptor materials is helpful in designing well-matched donor and acceptor materials which form good molecular stacking, a proper domain size, high domain purity, and suitable vertical phase separation in their blend films without the need for extra treatment, for future large-area fabrication of PSCs. Furthermore, a photoactive layer with tolerance of thickness variation in a wide range (such as 100–300 nm) is also essential for large-scale manufacture of PSCs, since thickness fluctuation is unavoidable in the high-speed manufacturing of the active layers. Developing photovoltaic materials with highly efficient charge transport and with suppressed charge recombination in thicker films is critical to address this issue.
Materials cost and scale-up synthesis are also important issues that should be considered when designing photovoltaic materials for future commercialization of PSCs. Nowadays most of the reported high-performance photovoltaic materials have rather complicated molecular structures, and the synthesis of the photovoltaic materials needs multiple steps with low yield and high cost. Thus, photovoltaic materials with simple molecular structure and fewer synthetic steps from low cost raw chemicals are desirable to meet the requirements of scale-up synthesis and low cost.
In addition, device stability is another key issue for the commercial application of PSCs. The device stability is related to the chemical stability of the photovoltaic, interfacial, and electrode materials, the morphology stability of the active layers, and the environmental stability of the devices. The environmental stability can be solved by suitable encapsulation. The reported high performance photovoltaic materials for nonfullerene PSCs possess good thermal stability at temperatures lower than 200 °C, but their photo-stability, especially under UV light irradiation, should be investigated and clearly understood. The glass transition temperature, purity and crystalline property of the photovoltaic materials will influence the morphology stability and the device performance of PSCs.
In general, complementary absorption, a relatively lower HOMO energy level, high hole mobility and suitable intermolecular interaction in matching with narrow bandgap n-OS acceptors are the key issues for the molecular design of conjugated polymer donors of nonfullerene PSCs. In the next step, research efforts should also be devoted to low cost and scale-up synthesis of high-performance photovoltaic materials with good photo-stability for commercial application of PSCs.
