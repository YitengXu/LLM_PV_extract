With the growing need for cost-effective and sustainable Internet of things (IoT) technologies, kesterite-based solar cells are gaining popularity. We report the fabrication of an efficient CZTSSe absorber layer with improved Voc loss and its possible use in indoor photovoltaic applications. The double cation incorporation (co-doping) approach is employed with Ag and Ge to achieve this. The devices fabricated and tested under standard illumination (1 sun) and low light intensity conditions showed enhanced device performances and lower Voc losses after co-doping. Under indoor light conditions, Voc of 290 mV with white LED (WLED) and 310 mV with fluorescent lamp (FL-4000K) was achieved at the lowest intensity of 400 lux, while a value exceeding 350 mV was obtained at 1200 lux with FL-4000K for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device. Voc recoveries of >60% under all intensity conditions and >70% at 1200 lux with both WLED and FL-4000K were achieved. Moreover, the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device showed efficiencies of 4.95% and 5.85% under WLED and FL-4000K at 1200 lux, respectively. The prototype device also demonstrated successful test results under indoor conditions. These achievements are attributed to the enhanced carrier density, reduced density of defects, and low carrier recombinations.

The growing cutting-edge technologies and human technological needs have completely changed the relationship between smart devices and human beings. These smart devices, which are also called the Internet of things (IoT), include smart meters, transport systems, industrial monitoring systems, traffic safety systems, environmental monitoring systems, and smart building-integrated devices. According to recent reports, it is expected that their numbers could exceed 100 billion by 2030 in the private and commercial sectors. Most of these devices are powered and rely mainly on battery or energy storage systems. However, energy storage devices such as batteries or supercapacitors have several limitations; they require timely maintenance, which creates excess waste, additional replacement costs, complexity when used with small devices and in remote areas, and limited long-term operational capabilities.

Thin film-based photovoltaic (PV) devices can be an alternative and efficient option to overcome these aforementioned difficulties. Their ability to generate power upon illumination and under low light intensity conditions, i.e., under fluorescent lamps and white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), makes them more suited for empowering IoTs. Therefore, different photo absorber materials such as perovskites, Si, GaAs, kesterites, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), CdTe, and chalcopyrite (CuInGaS2)-based thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) have been tested for indoor PV (IPV) applications. Apparently, the working principles of a PV device under indoor light and standard illumination conditions (outdoor) differ vastly owing to differences in the (i) source of light (outdoor: sun, indoor: LEDs, fluorescent tube lights, bulbs, etc.), (ii) irradiance intensity (outdoor: 100 mW cm−2, indoor: variable about 10–1000 times lower than outdoor), and (iii) incident spectral power density/irradiance spectral region of the lamp (outdoor: 300–2500 nm, indoor: 300–1000 nm). Therefore, to achieve maximum IPV performance and minimize the unfavorable light absorption losses, wide bandgap (Eg) materials are generally preferred over the narrow-bandgap ones.
Accordingly, Si solar cells, which exhibit over 25% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under 1 sun illumination, do not perform well under indoor light conditions. Their narrow Eg, spectral response mismatches, and unoptimized device configurations limit their IPV performances. On the other hand, DSSCs show excellent performance under indoor conditions owing to their unique absorption spectral regions. However, DSSCs comprising expensive ruthenium (Ru)-based dyes and platinum (Pt)-catalyzed counter electrodes generate material cost concerns in IPV applications. The IPV performances of organic PV (OPV) devices are limited by active layer degradation owing to the high moisture sensitivity, oxygen, and UV light. The inorganic wide-Eg materials in the 1.4–1.9 eV range, such as InGaP, GaAs, CIGS, and CdTe, also exhibit excellent IPV performances. But, the toxicity of Cd and low elemental Earth abundances of Ga and In have motivated scientists to seek alternative materials. To overcome the shortcomings of the traditionally tested IPV materials, we systematically noted a comparative study of the different kesterite-based devices in our previous report. During the primary screening, the CZTSSe device showed a maximum power output even with narrow Eg compared to the wide-Eg CZTS device. At present, kesterite-based device performances largely suffer from the large open-circuit voltage (Voc) deficit (Eg/q − Voc, where Eg is the bandgap of the device and q is the elemental charge). This large Voc deficit originates from the electrostatic potential and Eg fluctuations generated by the compositional inhomogeneities, in addition to the high density of various shallow- and deep-level defects. The limited success of kesterites under low light intensity conditions can also be ascribed to the inadequate density of carriers generated under very low light intensities (200–1000 lux) and their subsequent recombinations assisted by the trap states under indoor conditions.
The abovementioned issues can be systematically solved by doping or alloying the cations. Recently, Ag and Ge single-cation incorporation studies have shown promising results and achieved more than 12% PCE, along with a record PCE of 13% for Ag alloying. However, incorporating a single cation can cure only one type of defect; for example, Ag can mitigate only shallow-level Cu-related defects or Ge can cure only deep-level Sn-related defects. Thus, in recent times, double-cation incorporation such as Ag–Cd, Ag–Mn, Cd–Ge, Ag–Ge and alkali elements such as Ag–K and Ge–Na, have been reported in kesterites to improve the device PCEs. Qiu et al. reported Ag and Mn co-doping in CZTS thin films; they realized reduced defects and nonradiative recombinations by Ag and Mn co-doping to provide enhanced photoluminescence (PL). He et al. reported small amounts of Ge and Cd incorporation into the CZTSSe absorber layer; the Ge incorporation improved the p-type doping bulk conductance, resulting in reduced recombination in the quasi neutral region (QNR) via enhanced quasi-Fermi-level splitting, whereas Cd reduced the defect density near the space-charge region (SCR), providing a larger depletion region width (Wd). Fu et al. reported solution processed Ag–Ge doping in the CZTSSe absorber layer with dual-gradient absorber architecture and achieved 12.3% PCE; in their study, Ag doping near the front interface assisted the downshifting of the valence band (VB) maxima at the front contact, and Ge doping near the back interface provided upshifting of the conduction band (CB) minima near the back contact.
The successes of previous single- and double-cation incorporation studies have encouraged researchers to improve and modify the device performances of CZTSSe solar cells. Thus, inspired by these previous studies, we adopted Ag and Ge as the double-cation candidates to be incorporated in the CZTSSe absorber layer. Most importantly, although Fu et al. had already reported Ag–Ge co-doping in the CZTSSe absorber layer by solution process, the present work involves all the physical techniques processed double-cation incorporation and device fabrication. Moreover, this work focuses mainly on developing an efficient photo-absorber layer for IPV applications. The scope of this work does not include achieving a band-gradient architecture in the absorber layer, comparative co-doping study, or detailed investigation of the effects of double cations.
We increased the kesterite device performance under indoor light conditions by improving the Voc loss through suppressing the intrinsic kesterite defect density. To achieve this, we used individually optimized doping conditions such as thickness and position for the Ag and Ge cations. The deposition of Ag and Ge at the top and bottom of the precursor, respectively, improved the device performance under standard test conditions more than the undoped CZTSSe device. Further, a similar device tested under different light intensity conditions of white LED (WLED) and fluorescent lamps (4000 K) (FL-4000K) revealed improved Voc losses with higher PCE outputs for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device. The enhanced carrier density, grain size, and suppressed defect density mainly show synergy toward boosting device performance under IPV conditions.

The kesterite CZTSSe absorber layers were prepared in three steps (precursor preparation, soft-annealing, and sulfo-selenization process) on molybdenum (Mo)-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates. Precursors were deposited from individual metallic targets in stacked layers, i.e., Zn (bottom)/Sn/Cu(top), using the direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering method. For double-cation doping, i.e., Ag (8 nm) and Ge (10 nm), ultrathin layers were deposited individually at different stages (Ge at the bottom and Ag at the top of the precursor) using the thermal evaporation method. The precursors and Ag–Ge-doped samples were then soft annealed at 300 °C for 60 min in an Ar atmosphere at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 to achieve Cu–Zn and Cu–Sn alloys with smooth morphologies. The soft-annealed samples were placed in a graphite box with about 0.2 g of S/Se (1:100) powder for the sulfo-selenization process in the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) system. The RTA chamber was first preheated with a ramping rate of 10 °C s−1 in 2.30 min to reach the annealing temperature of 520 °C and maintained for 7.5 min to obtain the kesterite CZTSSe absorbers. Thereafter, potassium cyanide (KCN) etching was performed on all the samples (CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge) before depositing the CdS thin layer to eliminate the Cu-based secondary phases. The ultrathin CdS buffer layer of about 50 nm was deposited by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) layer of about 60 nm and a transparent conductive oxide layer, i.e., aluminum-doped ZnO (Al:ZnO), of 600 nm were deposited through the radio frequency (RF) sputtering method. Finally, ∼1 μm thick aluminum top contacts were prepared by the shadow-masking DC sputtering method. The fabricated devices were mechanically scribed and defined with an active cell area of 0.30 cm2. Further, details of the characterization technique used in this study and the methodology for IPV performance measurement (Fig. S1) can be found in the ESI.


Fig. S2(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the undoped CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge thin films. Both samples (CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge) show characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 27.27°, 45.3°, and 53.6°, corresponding to the (112), (204), and (312) lattice planes of the kesterite structure, respectively. Slight changes in the XRD peak positions toward lower 2θ values were also observed, as shown in Fig. S2(b). The shift in the XRD peak position corresponding to the (112) plane indicates that Ag–Ge was successfully incorporated in the CZTSSe crystal structure, which is attributed to the substitution of the larger-sized atoms that change the CZTSSe unit cell volume. Additionally, a small peak related to the Sn(S,Se)2 secondary phase was observed in the undoped CZTSSe sample, while no strong peak for Sn(S,Se)2 phase was found in the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample, as shown in Fig. S2(a). Hence, it can be said that the introduction of Ag and Ge minimize these phases further, as they are already minimized through optimization of the different process conditions in the undoped CZTSSe absorber layer. Fig. S3 shows the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) surface and cross-sectional images of the CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge thin films. The undoped CZTSSe sample has relatively sharp grain edges with few voids, while the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample has a more compact morphology with large grains and improved crystal quality (Fig. S3(a) and (b)). The cross-sectional views of the corresponding samples also show that the densities of the smaller grains and voids decrease near the back interface, and nearly micron-sized grains were formed after Ag and Ge co-doping (Fig. S3(c) and (d)). Further, the doping concentrations of Ag and Ge in the co-doped CZTSSe:Ag–Ge absorber thin film were estimated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), as shown in Fig. S4, and the extracted values are tabulated in Table S1. The Ag element was found to be around ∼0.95% and 0.67% (wt% and at%), respectively, while Ge was ∼0.06% (wt% and at%). Since we deposited Ag at the top and Ge at the bottom of the precursor layer with very low thickness (8–10 nm), it was difficult to detect them after the sulfo-selenization process. To further determine the elemental distributions of Ag and Ge in the CZTSSe absorber layer, the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM analyses were performed. The EDS mapping acquired for the co-doped sample showed a compact absorber morphology with few voids near the Mo/absorber back interface. The elemental mapping revealed uniform distribution of Ag, while a weak signal (noisy) was noted for Ge owing to the low doping percentage. In addition, no strong signals were detected for formation of the secondary phases in the bulk of the absorber layer under the measured conditions owing to the detection limit of the technique (Fig. S5). Similarly, the ToF-SIMS profile shows a nearly uniform distribution of Ag throughout the absorber layer, while Ge is found abundantly near the back interface. The other constituent kesterite elements, such as Cu, Zn, Sn, S, and Se, exhibit uniform distributions, consistent with the STEM analysis (Fig. S6).

It has been shown that Ag and Ge can efficiently modify the densities of defect states and their energy levels after successful doping into the kesterite crystal system. To confirm the changes in the energy levels and defect densities, admittance spectroscopy (AS) was carried out on the CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge devices. We analyzed the changes in the defect density via temperature-dependent capacitance–frequency (C–f–T) measurements for the undoped-CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge devices, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The inflection points were traced over the C–f–T spectra and used to construct the Arrhenius plots (Fig. 1(c) and (d)). Further, to deduce the defect activation energy levels, the slopes of the Arrhenius plots of ln(ω0/T2) vs. 1/KT were used, according to eqn (1),
(1)
where
ω0 is the inflection point of the C–f–T spectra, Ea is the trap activation energy, and ν0 is the emission factor. Further, the defect densities were determined from eqn (2) and (3),

(2)
(3)
where
E is the energy between the trap states and Ev, i.e., (E − Ev), Vbi is the built-in voltage of the p–n junction that can be derived from the C–V measurement, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The corresponding plots for the defect densities are shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f)). In the present work, only one defect energy level was observed in both samples (CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge). The calculated defect energy level in the undoped CZTSSe device was ∼198 meV, while that for CZTSSe:Ag–Ge was ∼96 meV. We compared the estimated activation energy levels with a previous first-principle calculation study and experimental works from literature. Accordingly, the estimated defect energy level in the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample (i.e., 96 meV) was assigned to the shallow acceptor ZnSn− and CuZn− antisite defects that are closer to Ev, while the deeper energy level in the undoped CZTSSe device (i.e., 198 meV) can be assumed to be deep acceptor ZnSn2− and CuSn− antisite defects. The estimated defect density of the undoped CZTSSe samples was ∼5.21 × 1015 cm−3, while that of the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample was ∼2.23 × 1015 cm−3, as shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f). We compared the defect energy levels and defect densities of the undoped CZTSSe, single-cation (Ag and Ge) incorporated, and double-cation (Ag–Ge) incorporated CZTSSe samples (Table S2); it is seen that doping with Ag and Ge simultaneously suppresses the density of defects efficiently.



Fig. 2(a)–(c) shows the statistical box plots of the device parameters, light current–voltage (J–V) characteristics, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge solar cells, respectively. The average and most efficient device performances under standard test conditions (STC) are given in Table S3. It is seen that the overall average device performance increases after double-cation (Ag–Ge) incorporation in the CZTSSe absorber layer (Fig. 2(a)). In particular, the average Voc and fill factor (FF) of the device improved by nearly 20 mV and 5%, respectively, delivering an enhanced average PCE of 9.83% in the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device. However, no large differences were observed in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) values of both devices. The most-efficient undoped CZTSSe device exhibited a PCE of 9.32%; in comparison, the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device showed a PCE of 10.17% owing to the significantly improved Voc from 477 to 510 mV (Fig. 2(b)). Moreover, a slight improvement in the FF from 60 to 63% and decrease in series resistance (Rs) from 11.75 to 10.24 Ω were observed. The EQEs measured for the most-efficient undoped CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge devices showed nearly similar spectral responses over the entire spectral region (Fig. 2(c)). Further, to precisely estimate the device Eg and Voc deficit, we determined the Eg values from dEQE/dλ by considering the EQE curves with a Gaussian fit and utmost fitting accuracy of R2 > 0.984. The estimated Eg values and their deviations are shown in Fig. S7 and Table S3. The CZTSSe sample exhibits an Eg of about 1.138 ± 0.002 eV, which improved by ∼8 meV to 1.146 ± 0.001 eV after co-doping. The Voc deficit estimated for the CZTSSe device was around 661 mV, which decreased by almost 25 mV to 636 mV for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device.

Fig. S8(a) and (b) shows the capacitance–voltage characteristics of the CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge devices. Fig. S8(b) depicts a typical “U” shaped carrier concentration profile with respect to the Wd of the kesterite solar cells. This profile was primarily observed because of the contributions of the deep-level defects and interface defect states. The Wd and carrier density (Na) have an inverse correlation; at a smaller Wd, a higher Na is observed, and a wider Wd is observed at lower Na. Similarly, the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device shows slightly higher Na and lower Wd (73 nm) values than the undoped CZTSSe device (95 nm) (Table S3). This shortened Wd of the SCR for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge solar cell was accompanied by an increase in Na, which is consistent with the observation in a previous report. This enhanced free Na is crucial for IPV devices as the increased Na assists the quasi-Fermi-level splitting by pushing the quasi-Fermi-level of the holes (Efp) toward the Ev of the absorber layer. Consequently, it improves the carrier separation process and Voc of the device, thereby improving the PCE upon ambient illumination conditions.

Before the IPV study, the irradiance spectra and integral power density of indoor illumination sources used in this work (WLED and FL-4000K) were measured, and their responses are shown in Fig. 3. The WLED shows intense irradiance shows peaks at 450, 520, and 630 nm (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the FL-4000K lamp shows 430, 550, and 610 nm (Fig. 3(b)). Further, to visualize the irradiance differences between indoor and outdoor conditions, the spectra were compared, as shown in Fig. 3(c), where limited photons are observed to be available for absorption under indoor conditions. To study the potential applications of kesterite-based solar cells under indoor conditions, the performances of the undoped (CZTSSe) and co-doped CZTSSe (CZTSSe:Ag–Ge) devices were measured under low light intensity conditions. Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics under WLED and FL-4000K for different illumination intensities (400, 800, and 1200 lux). The fabricated CZTSSe:Ag–Ge solar cell exhibited significant improvement in device performance under low light intensity conditions with the WLED and FL-4000K compared to the undoped CZTSSe solar cell (Table 1).

The PCE of the undoped CZTSSe device at 400 lux under WLED illumination was around 1.53%, which improved by more than two times after co-doping with Ag–Ge to reach 3.82%. At relatively higher illumination intensities of 800 and 1200 lux, the PCE was boosted from ∼3.2% to ∼4.9% for the WLED. Similarly, in the case of the FL-4000K lamp at 400 lux, the PCE of the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device improved nearly two times than the undoped CZTSSe device. Moreover, at 800 and 1200 lux, the PCEs improved from 3.71% to 4.99% and 4.72% to 5.85%, respectively. Thus, the PCE of 5.85% for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device was achieved with an FL-4000K lamp at 1200 lux illumination intensity. Following the same trend, the power outputs improved significantly for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device at 400, 800, and 1200 lux under illumination with WLED (9.08, 22.58, and 35.06 μW cm−2) and FL-4000K lamp (5.14, 13.94, and 23.99 μW cm−2), respectively. The power outputs were found to be more than two times higher under the WLED and FL-4000K lamp at 400 lux conditions for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device than the undoped CZTSSe device. Thus, a power output of 35 μW cm−2 was achieved with the WLED at 1200 lux.
From the obtained results under low light intensity measurements with the WLED and FL-4000K lamp, it is clear that the Ag–Ge doping effectively reduces Voc loss as the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device exhibits a Voc of ∼300 mV under WLED and FL-4000K lamp at the lowest intensity of 400 lux and values greater than 350 mV at 1200 lux intensity than the undoped CZTSSe device; this is the highest ever Voc reported under WLED and FL-4000K at the lowest intensities of 400 and 1200 lux for single-cell kesterite devices with an active area of 0.3 cm2. A detailed comparison between the device PCE and Voc under indoor light conditions is given in Table S4. It is known that the Jsc of the solar cell has a linear relation, while the Voc has a logarithmic relationship with incident light intensity. Therefore, rapid loss in the Voc of the CZTSSe device with respect to the decrease in illumination intensities can be attributed to the deep-level defect-assisted carrier recombinations under low light intensity conditions. The relative Voc recovery was calculated to compare the performance difference, and the detailed calculations and extracted values are given in the ESI and Table S5. This report shows a subsequent Voc recovery of 56.86% at 400 lux under the WLED and more than 64.0% under 800 and 1200 lux for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device than the undoped CZTSSe device. In addition, under the FL-4000K lamp, a maximum recovery of up to 70.59% at 1200 lux was observed, while 60.78% and 67.67% were observed at 400 and 800 lux, respectively. After Ag–Ge doping of the CZTSSe absorber layer, the FF improved significantly because of the reduced Rs and enhanced bulk conductivity of the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device under low light intensity conditions. The reduced density of the shallow-level defects, enhanced carrier density, and reduced carrier recombination within the SCR are the major factors that drive efficient carrier generation and separation in the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device under low light intensity conditions.
We performed Kelvin probe-force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate the local surface potential to determine the electrical properties of the CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge devices in the dark and under light intensities of 400, 800, and 1200 lux. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the contact potential difference (CPD) maps of the undoped CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge obtained in the dark; Fig. 5(c)–(h) represents the CPD maps measured under 400, 800, and 1200 lux, with the WLED as the illumination source. The surface topography images of the corresponding CPD maps are shown in Fig. S9.
The CPD is measured as the difference in the work function between the sample and the tip, where the work function of the used tip is −4.93 eV. Accordingly, the work functions of CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge are calculated, which were found to be around −4.39 and −4.55 eV, respectively. This implies that the work function of the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample reduces after co-doping Ag–Ge in the CZTSSe absorber layer. The CPD distribution curves of the maps obtained in the dark condition show that the undoped CZTSSe has a relatively higher CPD (0.54 V) than the co-doped CZTSSe:Ag–Ge (0.38 V) absorber layer (Fig. 5(i) and (j)). Under 400 lux, the curves shifted to lower CPDs for both samples; this lower CPD shift in the samples was mainly attributed to the accumulation of excess minority carriers toward the top of the surface of the absorber layer under illumination conditions. Further, the curves remained unchanged for the undoped CZTSSe sample even when the light intensity increased from 400 lux to 800 and 1200 lux. This indicates the occurrence of significant dominant carrier recombination among the charged carriers, limiting the excess carriers from reaching the top surface of the absorber layer. On the other hand, the curves continuously shifted to lower CPDs from 0.38 to 0.30 V for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample with increase in the light intensity, indicating that improved charge separation possibly resulted from the reduced shallower trap states than the undoped CZTSSe sample. We then conducted illumination on and off (light chopping) KPFM measurements, as shown in Fig. S10, to confirm whether the CPD remained unchanged for the CZTSSe sample as the light intensity increased from 400 lux to 800 and 1200 lux. These results are in good agreement and support the CPD distribution curves shown in Fig. 5(i) and (j) that the CPD for only the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample decreased moderately. Further, the average CPD values of the CZTSSe and CZTSSe:Ag–Ge samples at the grain interiors (GIs) and grain boundaries (GBs) obtained in the dark and under different light intensities are shown in Fig. 5(k) and (l). To calculate average CPD values at the GIs and GBs, 10 individual points were chosen from the topography image shown in Fig. S9, and the corresponding CPD values were obtained. Alternatively, the CPD values were obtained by drawing the line profiles to accurately find the point either at the GI or GB, as shown in Fig. S11. The CPD values of the GIs and GBs in the dark for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample are lower than those of the undoped CZTSSe sample. It is plausible that after co-doping, significant band bending occurs at the GBs, possibly due to the selective formation of shallow-level defects near the GBs. Interestingly, when the light intensity increased from 400 lux to 800 and 1200 lux, the CPDs of the GIs and GBs for the undoped CZTSSe sample remained the same (Fig. 5(k)). On the other hand, the CPDs of the GIs and GBs for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample decreased gradually upon illumination (Fig. 5(l)), suggesting that the charge separation at the GIs and GBs improved. In addition, from dark to 1200 lux, the CPD variations of the GBs and GIs for the undoped CZTSSe sample remained in the range of 0.01 V and 0.03 V, while these variations significantly increased to 0.09 V and 0.12 V for the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge sample, respectively. This efficient separation of the charge carriers and reduced recombinations at the GBs enhanced the device performance under low light intensity conditions.

Fig. 6(a) shows the block diagram of a power conversion system (PCS) for IPV application. The IPV module is connected to the PCS, where a rechargeable battery is considered for power storage, and different IoT sensors are included as the load. The features of PCS are as follows: (1) tracking the maximum power point of the IPV, (2) charging the battery with under- and over-voltage protection, (3) generating suitable voltage for IoT sensors, and (4) sending measured information from the IoT sensor to a smartphone using an integrated bluetooth module. Based on energy balance calculations, the IoT sensors were set to operate every 2 min for 1 s and in the sleep mode for the remaining time. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the size of the PCS is similar to that of a credit card and can be reduced further. Different IoT sensors are implemented to measure the indoor atmospheric conditions, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Moreover, we initially fabricated the CZTSSe:Ag–Ge module (5 × 5 cm2). Subsequently, we divided it into four sub-cells and connected them in series to boost the power output linked to the IoT booster. We also used a lux meter to monitor the real-time illumination conditions, revealing that the indoor light condition has an illumination intensity of ∼230 lux.

Fig. 7(a) shows the experimental setup of the IoT sensor powered by the CZTSSe IPV module. A smartphone application was developed to display the information from the IoT sensors. A light intensity of around ∼230 lux gives nearly 0.75 V of output voltage and current of around 49 mA. No information is displayed before the application is connected to the PCS (Fig. 7(b)), and once the application communicates with the PCS, it shows real-time indoor atmospheric conditions, such as temperature (21 °C), humidity (46%), and CO concentration (800 ppm) (Fig. 7(c)). A video of the real-time working model is given in the ESI Movie S1.

The present work successfully demonstrates the improvement in the Voc values of CZTSSe devices through Ag and Ge co-doping for promising IPV applications. The Ag and Ge co-doping enhances the quality of the CZTSSe absorber layer while suppressing the density of detrimental defects. The corresponding devices fabricated and tested under STC (1 sun) and low light intensity conditions showed significantly improved device performances and low Voc losses after co-doping. The CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device showed PCE and Voc enhancements from 9.32 to 10.17% and 477 to 510 mV, respectively, under STC. At the same time, under indoor light conditions, the device showed Voc values of 290 and 310 mV with WLED and FL-4000K lamp at the lowest intensity of 400 lux, respectively. Moreover, Voc recovery of >60% under all intensity conditions and up to >70% at 1200 lux with FL-4000K were achieved. With the improved Voc, enhanced carrier density, suppressed defect density, and reduced carrier recombinations, a power output of 35 μW cm−2 was attained with the WLED at 1200 lux intensity. The CZTSSe:Ag–Ge device showed PCEs of 4.95% and 5.85% with WLED and FL-4000K illumination at 1200 lux, respectively. These investigations and prototype module demonstration are expected to help the PV community and IoT sectors in developing a path toward economical and Earth-abundant-element-based ecofriendly IPV technologies for self-powered IoT sensors.
