Vertically aligned zinc oxide nanorod arrays (ZnO NRAs) are expected to provide a direct and stable electron transport pathway in polymer solar cells (PSCs) so as to enhance charge carrier collection and transport. However, the electrical coupling of ZnO NRAs/active layer and the surface defects limit the improvement of device performance. The modification of the surface of ZnO NRAs is an effective way to solve this problem. In this paper, we report the enhanced performance of inverted polymer solar cells (IPSCs) composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends by using bismuth oxysulfide (Bi2O2S) nanoparticle modified ZnO NRAs as an efficient electron transport layer (ETL). It is found that the modification of the ZnO NRA surface with Bi2O2S nanoparticles can effectively passivate the surface traps, reduce the series resistance, improve the electrical coupling of ZnO NRAs/active layer, and enhance the crystallinity of the active layer. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) of the PSCs are considerably improved. The resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved to 3.61% as compared to 2.47% for the reference device without Bi2O2S modification. Moreover, this approach can also successfully improve the performance of other IPSCs composed of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T):3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) blends. The PCE of the device based on the Bi2O2S-modified ZnO NRAs is improved to 9.89% from 7.76% for the reference device without Bi2O2S nanoparticle modification. This work not only provides an effective means of surface modification of ZnO NRAs, but also demonstrates that the Bi2O2S material has potential for application in photovoltaic devices.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive interest as a promising alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells due to their inherent advantages such as low cost, flexibility and easy-processing. Currently, the major challenges are achieving competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term stability in the atmosphere. The device architecture of conventional PSCs consists of a BHJ active layer sandwiched between a transparent conducting electrode (e.g. indium tin oxide, ITO) and a low-work-function metal electrode (e.g. Al or Ca). The BHJ active layer is usually achieved with a blend of the p-type polymer donor and n-type acceptor dissolved in a common solvent. The BHJ layer and cathode dramatically affect the stability. In particular, the low-work-function cathode is susceptible to degradation by oxygen and water vapor. In addition, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is often used as an anode buffer layer in devices, and the long-term stability becomes a big problem due to the hygroscopic and acidic properties of PEDOT:PSS. To overcome these problems, inverted polymer solar cells (IPSCs) have been developed. Here, Al for the top electrode adopted in conventional PSCs is replaced with an air stable high-work-function metal (e.g. Au or Ag). Meanwhile, PEDOT:PSS is removed from the device structure, and contact between ITO and PEDOT:PSS can be avoided.

One of the key factors limiting the performance of IPSCs is the electron transport layer (ETL). N-type metal oxides, such as titanium oxide (TiOx), zinc oxide (ZnO) and tin oxide (SnO2) have been developed as ETLs. Among them, ZnO is a very promising candidate due to its high electron mobility, good transparency, environmental stability, easy synthesis and low cost. IPSCs based on ZnO nanoparticles have shown better performance and long-term stability than conventional PSCs, and PCEs exceeding 14% have been reported. Vertically aligned one-dimensional ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) are currently attracting a great deal of attention. Besides similar advantages of ZnO nanoparticles, ZnO NRAs can provide direct and stable pathways for the transport of photogenerated electrons to the collecting electrode, and thus it's possible to increase the effective thickness of the active layer to enhance optical absorption. However, IPSCs based on ZnO NRAs have not demonstrated any significant improvement in device performance; the PCE is still not satisfactory, and the reported PCE of most devices is less than 6%. Surface defects of ZnO NRAs from the hydrothermal process can act as recombination centers to trap electrons. In addition, the poor electrical coupling of ZnO NRAs/active layer will impede charge transfer in devices. Furthermore, the energy level mismatch between ZnO NRAs and the active layer is harmful to the separation of electron–hole pairs and charge transport in IPSCs. Coating a thin self-assembled layer of small molecules can restrain surface traps to some extent, which improves the electrical coupling between ZnO NRAs and the active layer, and consequently improves the device performance. Several narrow band-gap nanomaterials, such as CdS, Sb2S3 (ref. 33) and CuInS2, have also been used to modify the surface of ZnO NRAs, and they can passivate the surface of ZnO NRAs and reduce charge recombination. Furthermore, from the industrial point of view, the nanomaterials should be environmentally friendly and low-cost, and further understanding of the interface of ZnO NRAs/active layer is required for better device performance.
Recently, bismuth compounds (Bi2O2S, Bi2O2Se, Bi2O2Te, etc.) have attracted enormous attention in pollutant purification, photocatalysis and photodetection due to their nontoxicity, ultrahigh Hall mobility, layered structure and narrow band gap. Among them, bismuth oxysulfide (Bi2O2S) not only exhibits a fast photoelectric response under visible light, but also shows high-intensity absorption of visible light. Moreover, Bi2O2S shows efficient charge dissociation, high charge carrier transport and long carrier lifetime. The material has a loosely packed structure with a crystal packing factor (PF) of 0.66, which approximates to a MAPbI3 PF value of 0.65. The PF is an important parameter to evaluate the charge dissociation and carrier transport abilities of materials. A lower PF value of materials indicates that they possess higher internal electric field and lower elastic stiffness, resulting in more efficient charge dissociation, higher carrier mobility and longer carrier lifetime. Few research studies, however, have been performed on applying Bi2O2S to solar cells.
Herein, ZnO NRAs were in situ synthesized on ITO substrates by a hydrothermal method at low temperature and were modified with different concentrations of Bi2O2S nanoparticles by a very simple method, and then IPSCs with efficient ETLs (ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S) were fabricated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on ZnO NRAs modified by Bi2O2S nanoparticles and on ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites as the ETL in IPSCs. The active layer used is composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))](PBDB-T):3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) blends, and both IPSCs show considerably improved device performance by using the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S ETL. In this regard, the PCE of the device based on the P3HT:PCBM blend system is improved to 3.61% as compared to 2.47% for the reference device without Bi2O2S modification. The PCE of the device based on PBDB-T:ITIC with the Bi2O2S-modified ZnO NRAs is also obviously improved to 9.89% from 7.76% for the reference device without Bi2O2S modification. It should be noted that the PCE of 9.89% is the state-of-the-art value so far for IPSCs with ZnO NRAs as the ETL. Bi2O2S nanoparticles are found to effectively passivate the surface defects of ZnO NRAs, and improve the electrical coupling of ZnO NRAs/active layer. More interestingly, Bi2O2S can improve the crystallinity of both ZnO NRAs and the active layer to provide higher charge transfer and stronger optical absorption in devices.

Fig. S1(a) shows that our synthetic Bi2O2S material comprises nanoparticles with diameter of more than 10 nanometers, and the clear lattice fringe of an individual Bi2O2S nanoparticle in Fig. S1(a) indicates that the prepared Bi2O2S nanoparticles have good crystallinity. The XRD spectrum in Fig. S1(b) confirms that the Bi2O2S particles have crystallized in the high purity orthorhombic phase (JCPDS no. 34-1493), which is indexed to the Pnnm space group. From Fig. S2(a) and (b), we calculated the Eg of Bi2O2S to be about 1.31 eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of Bi2O2S to be −5.54 eV. Therefore, the corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of Bi2O2S is calculated to be −4.23 eV. Fig. S2(c) and (d) reveal that ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites possess high transmittance in the visible light region, which indicates that more incident light can enter the active layer of the solar cells through the ETL material. Fig. 1(a) shows the inverted device structure used here, where MoO3 was deposited on top of the active layer as the hole transport layer (HTL), and various Bi2O2S-modified ZnO NRAs served as the ETLs. Fig. 1(b) shows the energy level diagram with all component materials used in the IPSCs, and it reveals that this energy cascade structure facilitates the transmission of charge in the solar cells.


Fig. 2(a–c) show the full scan XPS spectra, and O 1s and Zn 2p XPS spectra of the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composite films with various concentrations of Bi2O2S. From Fig. 2(a), the strong peaks of Zn, O, S and Bi atoms can be found. Fig. 2(b) shows that the O 1s spectra of the bare ZnO NRAs can be divided into three peaks at 530.2 eV, 531.5 eV and 532.6 eV, respectively. The strong peak at a binding energy of 530.2 eV is associated with the lattice oxygen of ZnO (Zn–O), the middle peak at 531.5 eV corresponds to the oxygen vacancies (VO) and the higher binding peak at 532.6 eV is attributed to the presence of loosely bound oxygen on the surface of ZnO (O-L). The lower binding energy component, centered at 530.0 eV, is associated with the Bi–O bond. Moreover, the intensity ratios of the peak at 530.2 eV to that at 531.5 eV are 1:0.769, 1:0.637 (1%), 1:0.615 (2%) and 1:0.736 (3%), respectively, which demonstrates that the oxygen vacancies of ZnO NRAs are effectively reduced after the surface modification with Bi2O2S nanoparticles, and ZnO NRAs modified by 2% Bi2O2S have the lowest number of oxygen vacancies. However, modification with excess Bi2O2S can result in an increase in the VO (3%). Therefore, the optimum concentration of Bi2O2S for surface modification of ZnO NRAs is 2%. Fig. 2(c) shows that the two strong peaks at 1021.9 and 1045.1 eV correspond to the XPS spectra of Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the Zn2+ state of ZnO NRAs. It is also observed that the binding energy of ZnO shifts towards a higher value of 0.2 eV with a relatively lower intensity. The shift implies that Zn atoms bound to O atoms are reduced and they probably form Zn–S bonds between ZnO NRAs and Bi2O2S nanoparticles. Through Zn–S bonding, Bi2O2S can form a well-ordered monolayer on ZnO NRAs. From Fig. S3, we can see that the intensity of S peaks becomes stronger with the increase of the Bi2O2S concentration, further demonstrating the formation of Zn–S bonds on the ZnO surface. It has been reported that electrons can be rapidly transferred across the Bi2O2S layer due to the static electric field established by the Zn–S bonding. So the surface modification with 2% Bi2O2S can effectively reduce the oxygen vacancies of ZnO NRAs, and improve the electron transport through Zn–S bonding, which helps to increase the FF and Jsc of PSCs.
From SEM analysis, the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S films were also found to demonstrate very good perpendicularity and a good compact surface. Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM image of bare ZnO NRAs on ITO, which indicates the successful growth of nanorods, but the diameter of the nanorods is not uniform with a distribution from 41 to 65 nm. After the surface modification with Bi2O2S, the surface of ZnO NRAs becomes more and more uniform, and the nanorods grow larger and more compact (Fig. 3(b)–(c)), while the surface becomes coarse with some small precipitates when ZnO NRAs are covered with excess Bi2O2S (3%) (Fig. 3(d)). Furthermore, from the cross-sectional images, nanorods in ZnO NRAs are shown to align vertically on the ITO surface with a length of about 250.3 nm (Fig. 3(e)). Upon surface modification with Bi2O2S, they grow longer to over 265.8 nm (from Fig. 3(f)–(h)). Furthermore, the TEM results indicate that ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S is a core–shell structure with a combination of polycrystalline ZnO and single crystalline Bi2O2S (Fig. S4). Here, the ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S film demonstrates a uniform and compact surface with fewer defects, which may hold promise for efficient charge transport in devices.

Fig. 4(a) shows the PL spectra recorded for various ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S thin films. As can be seen, there are two emission peaks. The near-band-edge emission in the UV range is attributed to exciton recombination, while the broad visible-range emission occurs as a result of surface defects. The electron transfer between deep levels and the oxygen dangling bonds associated with zinc vacancies are the most commonly reported defects responsible for the defect emission. The results clearly show that the defect emission is considerably restrained by surface modification of ZnO NRAs with Bi2O2S, indicating reduced surface defects on ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S. Besides, the intensity ratio of near-band-edge to defect emission is one of the most important factors for comparing the optical properties. The high intensity ratio indicates the high crystalline quality of ZnO NRAs due to the effective passivation of surface defects. From Fig. 4(a), the intensity ratio for bare ZnO is found to be 0.132, and it increases to 0.186, 0.276 and 0.213 for Bi2O2S concentrations of 1%, 2% and 3%, respectively. The highest ratio with the concentration of 2% corresponds to the good crystalline quality of ZnO NRAs induced by Bi2O2S, which is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. S5). XRD measurements in Fig. S5 show that the surface modification with Bi2O2S improves the crystallinity of ZnO NRAs, and the best crystallinity is observed when a Bi2O2S concentration of 2% is used.
The reduction of surface defects can also be detected by X-band EPR measurement, shown in Fig. 4(b). Inspection of Fig. 4(b) reveals that all ZnO NRA samples exhibit the same types of paramagnetic defect centers at g = 1.960, which has already been reported in the literature. The signal at g = 1.960 is widely assigned to the core defects, for example the shallow donor/deep acceptor states in the band gap of ZnO. Besides, there is an additional signal at g = 2.004, which is attributed to the surface defects. Obviously, the surface signal is much more affected by the Bi2O2S modification than the core signal. From Fig. 4(b), we can see that Bi2O2S modification can lower the surface defect signal and the signal of ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S is greatly suppressed, which is consistent with the previous XPS (Fig. 2(b)) and PL results (Fig. 4(a)). Therefore, we can be sure that the Bi2O2S modification can suppress the surface defects and 2% Bi2O2S is the most useful.
It is clear from the CV measurements in Fig. 4(c) that all ZnO NRAs and ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites show two redox peaks, and the left negative peak represents the reduction peak and the right positive peak represents the oxidation peak, respectively (Fig. 4(c)). The peak-to-peak separation (Epp) is calculated from the voltage value difference between the reduction peak (ERE) and oxidation peak (EOX) (Epp = EOX − ERE). After Bi2O2S coating, both redox peaks show a positive shift. The ERE of ZnO NRAs is −0.107 V and the EOX is 0.327 V, while the ERE of ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S is 0.267 V and the EOX is 0.399 V. Therefore, Epp of bare ZnO NRAs is 0.434 V and the Epp of ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S is 0.132 V. Theoretically, Epp differs inversely with the charge-transfer rate, and thus, the smaller Epp of ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S implies a higher charge-transfer rate. Besides, the intensity of the reduction peaks decreases after Bi2O2S coating, indicating the suppression of recombination. When electrons inject into ZnO NRAs, they will either be trapped by the surface defects where they will undergo charge recombination or inject into the ZnO NRAs where they will undergo charge transfer. The injecting into ZnO NRAs will inevitably increase the electron mobility (μe) whereas the recombination will decrease μe.
The passivation of surface defects and good crystalline quality may contribute to high conductivity and carrier mobility in ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S thin films. Fig. 4(d) shows the J–V curves of the electron-only devices in the dark, with the device structure of ITO/ZnO NRAs (or ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S)/Ca/Al. The electron mobility (μe) is then characterized by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method based on the model
(1)
where
d is the thickness of the active layer, ε0 is the permittivity of free space and εr is the relative permittivity of the materials. The results show that Bi2O2S coating leads to a larger μe compared to that of bare ZnO NRAs (2.67 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1). The highest μe value is obtained after 2% Bi2O2S coating (9.96 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1) and μe values are 7.87 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1 and 7.16 × 10−4 cm2 v−1 s−1 for 1% Bi2O2S and 3% Bi2O2S, respectively. There is a good crystalline quality and reduced oxygen vacancies in the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites and the formation of Zn–S bonds at the interface, which improves the conductivity of ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S thin films. The rapid transfer across ETLs will prevent charge carrier recombination in the photovoltaic devices.

To investigate the effect of ZnO NRAs modified by Bi2O2S on the crystallinity of the active layer, we investigated the crystallinity of P3HT using UV-vis and XRD spectra. Fig. 5(a) presents the XRD measurements of ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S/P3HT:PCBM with ITO as the substrate. The P3HT crystalline lamellae with a (100) peak located at a small angle of 5.3° is shown, corresponding to the interlamellar distances of ∼1.6 nm in P3HT crystallites. It is interesting to find that the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites can influence the self-assembly of the active layer. The (100) peak increases gradually in intensity with Bi2O2S modification on ZnO NRAs, and the peak of 2% Bi2O2S is sharper and stronger, indicating the best crystallinity of P3HT with the ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S layer. In addition, the corresponding UV-vis spectra show a similar trend to XRD (Fig. 5(b)). With the increase of Bi2O2S concentration on the surface of ZnO NRAs, the UV-vis spectral intensity of P3HT:PCBM increases as well. The films show the main absorption peak at ∼510 nm with two shoulder peaks at 550 nm and 605 nm. The main peak depends on the spin-coating parameters and hence the crystallinity of P3HT, while the 605 nm peak corresponds to the interchain excitation. When a Bi2O2S concentration of 2% is adopted, the P3HT:PCBM film shows the strongest absorption, and the peak at 605 nm has high intensity, corresponding to a vibronic feature, indicating an orderly chain stacking in P3HT. When the Bi2O2S concentration is increased to 3%, the absorption peaks decrease. These results further show that the Bi2O2S modification on ZnO NRAs improves the chain stacking and crystallinity of P3HT, and Bi2O2S with a concentration of 2% has the best result. The better crystallinity of P3HT may contribute to the higher optical absorption and thus to the enhancement of Jsc and FF of IPSCs.
To investigate the compatibility between ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S and the active layer, the water contact angles (WCAs) of ZnO NRAs before and after Bi2O2S coating were measured and the results are presented in Fig. 6(a–d). The WCA increases from 88.37° for bare ZnO NRAs (Fig. 6(a)) to 93.71° (Fig. 6(b)), 98.31° (Fig. 6(c)) and 98.29° (Fig. 6(d)) after coating with 1%, 2% and 3% Bi2O2S, respectively. There is a subtle increase (5–10%) in the WCA after Bi2O2S coating, which indicates that the ZnO NRA surface turns slightly more hydrophobic upon modification with Bi2O2S. So modifying the ZnO NRAs with Bi2O2S enhances the compatibility between the polymer active layer and metal oxide. Moreover, the increased WCAs may cause a decrease in surface energy, resulting in greater crystallinity of segregated P3HT materials. ZnO NRAs coated with 2% Bi2O2S possess the largest WCA of 98.31°, so this produces the best compatibility between the polymer active layer and ZnO NRAs, and the most ordered crystallinity in the active layer. These findings are in good agreement with the above results of XRD spectra (Fig. 5(a)) and UV-vis absorbance (Fig. 5(b)).
Fig. S6 shows the WCAs of the ZnO NRAs/(Bi2O2S)/P3HT:PCBM, ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S/PCBM and ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S/P3HT. The results indicate that the vertical phase separation in the active layer mainly occurs near the Bi2O2S side due to the improved compatibility between ZnO NRAs and the active layer resulting from Bi2O2S modification, and near the ZnO NRA side will be the PCBM rich region, and P3HT will be gathered at the top of the active layer. Vertical phase separation in the active layer helps in the transport of charge in the device. Consequently, efficient charge transfer will be induced, increasing the Jsc of the devices.
To investigate the function of bare ZnO NRAs and ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites in PSCs, we selected two types of PSCs based on P3HT:PCBM and PBDB-T:ITIC as light-absorbing layers, and bare ZnO NRAs and ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites as the cathode. The device structure is ITO/ZnO NRAs (or ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites)/P3HT:PCBM (or PBDB-T:ITIC)/MoO3/Ag. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the illuminated and dark J–V curves of the solar cells under 100 mW cm−2, for which the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) of IPSCs based on P3HT:PCBM incorporating ZnO NRAs with Bi2O2S modification as the ETL are shown in Fig. 7(a). The corresponding device parameters are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, the reference device with bare ZnO NRAs (device A) shows a Voc of 0.57 V, a Jsc of 8.49 mA cm−2, a FF of 51.1%, and a PCE of 2.47%. The device performance is considerably improved when Bi2O2S is introduced on top of ZnO NRAs. The optimum device performance is achieved when using ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S (device C) as the ETL, and it displays a Voc of 0.61 V, a Jsc of 9.98 mA cm−2, a FF of 59.3%, and a PCE of 3.61%. However, as the concentration of Bi2O2S further increases, the device performance starts to decrease. When the concentration of Bi2O2S increases to over 3% (device D), the device shows a smaller Voc of 0.60 V, a lower Jsc of 9.55 mA cm−2, and a reduced FF of 57.0%, giving a final PCE of 3.27%. Surface modification with Bi2O2S effectively reduces surface defects of ZnO NRAs (Fig. 2(b), 4(a) and S5) and increases the optical absorption of the active layer (Fig. 5). Enhanced electronic coupling (Fig. 6) also makes the electron injection from the polymer active layer to the ZnO NRAs become more efficient. All of this helps to increase the Jsc and FF of the devices.

The sheet resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the IPSCs were extracted from the illuminated J–V characteristics and the results are summarized in Table 1. Rs reflects the ohmic loss in the entire device structure including contact resistance at the interface and the bulk resistance of the interfacial layers and the active layer. Rsh reflects the loss of charge carriers due to the current leakage pathways and charge recombination in the bulk or at the interface. Device A shows a Rs of 7.99 Ω cm2 and a Rsh of 63.65 Ω cm2, respectively. Device C shows the smallest Rs of 1.04 Ω cm2 and the highest Rsh of 84.64 Ω cm2. The reduced Rs is favorable for charge collection, and the increased Rsh indicates reduced leakage current as well as restrained recombination loss of carriers, which explains the improved Jsc and FF. When the Bi2O2S concentration is increased up to 3% (device D), the Rs of the device is increased to 5.48 Ω cm2, which creates a large energy barrier for charge collection. In this case, many carriers recombine before they are collected at the electrodes. Therefore, a small Jsc and FF can be expected when charge collection is inefficient due to a large Rs. Fig. 7(b) shows the dark J–V curves on a logarithmic scale of the reference device and devices with the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S ETL. As the Bi2O2S concentration increases, the leakage current is considerably restrained, while the operating current displays an incremental trend. In this case, the rectification ratio of devices with the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S ETL is greatly increased, among which the 2% Bi2O2S-modified device shows the best rectification ratio. These results further confirm that the Bi2O2S species can effectively passivate the traps of ZnO NRAs, leading to improved electrical coupling with the active layer. Fig. 7(c) shows the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of IPSCs with bare ZnO NRAs and ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S as ETLs. The whole EQE considerably increases with the introduction of Bi2O2S, which is similar to the trend observed for Jsc (Fig. 7(a)), further confirming the improved photoelectron conversion efficiency. Stability is also an important characteristic of the devices, and it can be affected by the surface defects in ZnO NRA-based IPSCs.Fig. 7(d) displays the device PCEs of P3HT:PCBM devices with and without Bi2O2S coverage as a function of aging time. All of these devices are stored in a glovebox filled with nitrogen (O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm) without encapsulation. The PCEs decrease sharply for device A and only ∼18.2% of its initial efficiency (from 2.47 to 0.45%) is retained after 44 days. In comparison, device C retains ∼54.0% of its initial efficiency, reaching 1.95% after storage for 44 days. The oxygen vacancies of ZnO NRAs are dramatically reduced by Bi2O2S coverage, where degradation of the devices efficiency becomes slow, so the stability of devices increases after Bi2O2S coverage.
The Voc is also considerably improved with the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S ETL in P3HT:PCBM IPSCs. The WF of different ETLs is thus measured (Table 2). The WF of bare ZnO NRAs is −4.42 eV, similar to what has been reported before. As the Bi2O2S concentration increases, the WF shifts upward and reaches a stable value of −4.32 eV for ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S. As is shown in Fig. 1(b), with 2% Bi2O2S modification, the WF of the ETL shows a perfect energy level alignment and ohmic contact can be formed at the interface of the ETL/active layer, which is beneficial for improving Voc. The deep Fermi level of ZnO NRAs leads to a mismatch of the energy level with PCBM, resulting in a lower Voc of 0.57 V. With Bi2O2S modification on ZnO NRAs, the Zn–S bonds formed between ZnO NRAs and Bi2O2S can result in the formation of a bond dipole on the ZnO NRA surface with an electric field pointing toward the active layer. This electric field can not only rapidly transfer electrons from Bi2O2S to the ZnO NRAs, hence preventing charge carrier recombination, but also enhances the Voc of the devices due to the electric field resulting from Zn–S bonding. Moreover, the recombination centers of surface defects cause free carrier loss and internal voltage drop. As illustrated in the PL spectra, the surface defect reduction can be detected clearly, which will reduce the trapped charges, and lower the free carrier loss and internal voltage drop. As a result, the Voc is considerably improved from 0.57 V for the reference device to 0.61 V for the device with the 0.2% Bi2O2S modified ETL.

Then the dependences of Jsc and Voc on incident light intensity were measured to verify the effect of Bi2O2S coverage on the photogenerated charge carrier recombination process. In the ZnO NRA based IPSCs, the photogenerated charge carriers will recombine both in the photoactive layer and the surface defects.Fig. 7(e) shows that the Voc of the IPSCs varies logarithmically with light intensity (lnP0), which is used to define the charge carrier recombination. In principle, the charge carrier recombination is measured using the relationship
where
k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute thermodynamic temperature. It has been documented that the slope of Vocversus lnP0 will be equal to kT/q if the bimolecular recombination governs while the slope will be equal to 2kT/q if monomolecular recombination is dominant. As is shown in Fig. 7(e), all devices possess a Voc dependence on lnP0 with a slope smaller than 2kT/q and after Bi2O2S coverage, the slope draws closer to 1kT/q. The pristine ZnO NRA-based device exhibits a slope of 1.33kT/q, demonstrating the existence of defect-assisted recombination in the device. The ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S-based devices show smaller slopes of 1.27kT/q, 1.19kT/q and 1.23kT/q for ZnO NRAs/1% Bi2O2S, ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S and ZnO NRAs/3% Bi2O2S, respectively. This result clearly verifies the earlier results that the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S ETLs can effectively reduce interfacial defect-assisted recombination in devices.

The variations of Jsc as a function of P0 were also studied and modeled with the equation
Jsc ∝ P0α
where
α is the exponential factor. When all the generated excitons are swept out and collected at the electrodes, α will be close to 1. Fig. 7(f) shows the dependence of Jsc on P0 of the devices, in which the fitted slope (α) is 0.904, 0.947, 0.981 and 0.978 for the ZnO NRAs, ZnO NRAs/1% Bi2O2S, ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S and ZnO NRAs/3% Bi2O2S devices, respectively. This result confirms that the Bi2O2S coverage can enhance charge extraction across the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S/BHJ interface.

To gain more insight into the exciton dissociation process, we measured the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves under short circuit and maximum power point conditions in Fig. 7(g). Jph, Veff and Jsat are defined as follows:
Jph = JL − JD
Veff = V0 − Va
Jsat = qLGmax
where
JL is the photocurrent density, JD is the dark current density, V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0, Va is the applied voltage, q is elementary charge, L is the thickness of the active layer, and Gmax is the maximum amount of absorbed photons. We can see from Fig. 7(g) that Jph is almost linearly related to the Veff when the voltage is at a low value, and it reaches a saturated state especially when Veff is higher than 2 V. So Jsat can be obtained at a Veff higher than 2 V, and the Jph, Jsat, Gmax, and Jph/Jsat values under short circuit and maximum power point conditions were calculated and the results are listed in Table 2. For P3HT:PCBM based IPSCs with ZnO NRAs, ZnO NRAs/1% Bi2O2S, ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S and ZnO NRAs/3% Bi2O2S as ETLs, the Jph values are 8.49, 9.34, 9.98 and 9.55 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding Jsat values at Veff = 2 V are calculated to be 9.78, 10.41, 11.01 and 10.58 mA cm−2, respectively. Therefore, Jph/Jsat values under short circuit current conditions are 86.81%, 89.72%, 90.65% and 90.26%, respectively, while the respective values are 75.56%, 79.35%, 81.38% and 80.44% under maximum power-point conditions. The higher Jph/Jsat value for ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S based IPSCs under short circuit current and maximum power point conditions demonstrates the efficient dissociation of photogenerated excitons into free charge carriers and a weaker bimolecular recombination. A weaker recombination corresponds to efficient charge carrier transport and collection at the individual electrodes, which will result in high Jsc and FF. However, the lowest Jph/Jsat value of bare ZnO NRA-based IPSCs is attributed to the lower charge carrier mobility (Fig. 4(c)) and poor crystallinity (Fig. 5(a)) of the P3HT:PCBM layer without Bi2O2S coverage. The Gmax values for different concentrations of Bi2O2S are 6.11 × 1027 (ZnO NRAs), 6.51 × 1027 (ZnO NRAs/1% Bi2O2S), 6.88 × 1027 (ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S) and 6.61 × 1027 m−3 s−1 (ZnO NRAs/3% Bi2O2S), respectively. The IPSCs with ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S as the ETL possess the highest Gmax value, which means that more photons can be harvested by the P3HT:PCBM layers and thus a higher photogenerated exciton generation rate can be achieved. This result further confirms the results of the absorption spectra and EQE spectra of the corresponding IPSCs.

It is worth mentioning that this approach can be also successfully applied in other well-studied material systems of PBDB-T:ITIC. Fig. 8(a)–(c) show the illuminated and dark J–V curves and EQE spectra of devices based on PBDB-T:ITIC using ZnO NRAs and ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S as ETLs. The observed variation in the device performance of the PBDB-T:ITIC-based devices is similar to that of previous P3HT:PCBM-based devices. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. Device E based on PBDB-T:ITIC with bare ZnO NRAs exhibits a Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 14.37 mA cm−2, and FF of 62.1%, while device F based on PBDB-T:ITIC with ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S exhibits a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 15.89 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.4%. Consequently, device F with a ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S layer shows a considerably improved PCE of 9.89% as compared to 7.76% for the reference device E. The EQE spectra shown in Fig. 8(c) confirm the improved Jsc of the device with the ZnO NRAs/2% Bi2O2S ETL. These results demonstrate a generally applicable approach to improve the performance of IPSCs.

In order to evaluate the effect of Bi2O2S material modifying ZnO nanoparticles (NPs), IPSCs using ZnO NPs as the ETL were fabricated. The P3HT:PCBM blend system serves as the active layer, and the structure of the device is ITO/ZnO NPs (ZnO NPs/2% Bi2O2S)/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Al. The illuminated and dark J–V characteristics and EQE characteristics of IPSCs based on ZnO NPs and ZnO NPs/2% Bi2O2S are shown in Fig. 8(d)–(f), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 4. We can see from Table 4 that Bi2O2S modification can also exert great influence on solar cells based on ZnO NP ETLs. The reference device with bare ZnO NPs (device G) shows a Voc of 0.59 V, a Jsc of 8.89 mA cm−2, a FF of 61.0%, and a PCE of 3.20%. The device performance is considerably improved with 2% Bi2O2S modifying the surface of ZnO NRAs. Device H displays a Voc of 0.62 V, a Jsc of 10.18 mA cm−2, a FF of 65.0%, and a PCE of 4.10%. This result shows that modification with the Bi2O2S material is also suitable for ZnO NPs.

In summary, for the first time, we have successfully fabricated ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S as an electron transport layer in IPSCs. It is demonstrated that the Bi2O2S modification of the ZnO NRA surface can effectively passivate its surface defects, improve electrical coupling and compatibility of the ZnO NRAs/active layer and reduce the series resistance. Consequently, Jsc, Voc, and FF of the inverted polymer solar cells are considerably improved. For P3HT:PCBM and PBDB-T:ITIC based IPSCs, the PCEs are significantly improved from the original 2.47 and 7.76% to 3.61 and 9.89%, respectively. Moreover, it is interesting to find that the ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S layer can induce the crystallinity of the active layer, which is beneficial for improving the optical absorption properties of the active layer. Therefore, the recombination can be effectively reduced, efficient charge extraction can be induced and longer stability is obtained. These results indicate a generally applicable electron transport layer for ambient, stable and high-efficiency IPSCs. This work demonstrates the great potential for use of bismuth compounds in photovoltaic device fields. Our work paves a way to unfold the potential of bismuth compounds for application in photovoltaic devices.


P3HT, PBDB-T, ITIC and PCBM were purchased from Rieke Metals and other reagents from Sigma-Aldrich. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Distilled water was used throughout the experiment.


Firstly, 3 mM CH4N2S was dissolved in 60 ml of NaOH (0.3 M) solution and then 0.3 mM Bi2O3 powder was added with frequent stirring. Next, the mixture (white) was transferred into a 100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) lined pressure autoclave, and then it was annealed and stirred at 180 °C for 40 h. Finally, Bi2O2S was obtained by centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol respectively several times. The as-prepared Bi2O2S powders (black) were then dispersed in distilled water by sonication, and Bi2O2S aqueous solutions (1%, 2% and 3%) were ready for use.


ITO-coated substrates were cleaned by sonication for 15 min each with acetone, isopropyl alcohol and ethanol, respectively, followed by O2 plasma treatment. ZnO seed layers were prepared on ITO by spin-coating from zinc acetate and equivalent molar ethanolamine in ethanol, and then rinsed in a thermal bath solution at 90 °C for 50 min. The thermal bath solution consisted of 5 mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) (4 ml) and 5 mM hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) (4 ml). ZnO NRAs were then successfully grown on the ITO surface. ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S composites were prepared by dropping Bi2O2S aqueous solution (0%, 1%, 2% and 3%) onto ZnO NRAs, followed by rinsing in distilled water. For convenience, composites with different concentrations of Bi2O2S (0%, 1%, 2% and 3%) were termed A, B, C and D, respectively. All films were dried in an oven at 80 °C and they were ready for use.


Zinc oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by the Heeger method. 1 g zinc acetate were dissolved in 10 ml 2-methoxyethanol with strong stirring, and then 280 μl 2-methoxyethanol were added into the mixed solution. After stirring for 12 h, the ZnO NP precursor was fully prepared. The ZnO NP precursor was spin-coated on a cleaned ITO substrate and annealed at 200 °C for 1 hour, after which ZnO NP ETLs were fabricated. ZnO NPs/2% Bi2O2S was prepared by dropping 2% Bi2O2S aqueous solution onto ZnO NPs, followed by rinsing in distilled water.


Both solutions of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 by weight) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1 by weight) in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (97:3, v/v) were stirred overnight at 50 °C in a glovebox. Before spin-coating, they were filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter. ITO/ZnO NRAs and ITO/ZnO NRAs/Bi2O2S were transferred into the glovebox where P3HT:PCBM (or PBDB-T:ITIC) solution was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 40 s. The thickness of P3HT:PCBM and PBDB-T:ITIC were about 200 nm and 100 nm, respectively. Prior to the final cathode deposition (Ag, 100 nm), a 7 nm molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) interlayer was evaporated in a vacuum of about 3.0 × 10−4 Pa. The active area was defined as 0.15 cm2. J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source unit. Solar cell performance was measured using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) at room temperature.


The UV-vis spectra were recorded with an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected using a SPEX 1681. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a ZEISS Merlin, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with a JEOL-2100. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Bruker Discovery 08 diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with an Axis Ultra DLD using a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source. For XPS data, curve fitting and linear background subtraction were done using CASA XPS software. The work function (WF) was measured with a KP Technology SKP5050. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on an ECO Chemie. Contact angle measurements were performed using a DSA100 equipped with a video capture device using 5 μl of water as the probe liquid at room temperature.
