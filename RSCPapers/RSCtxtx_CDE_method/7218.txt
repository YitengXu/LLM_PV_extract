The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) is closely associated with the conduction band energy, conductivity and coverage of the compact layer. However, as the most widely used compact layer material, TiO2 has unfavorable electrical properties such as low electron mobility and conductivity; as a result, modifications such as elemental doping are of paramount importance. In this study, Nb-doped TiO2 with improved carrier density and conductivity was prepared via a facile one-pot solution process and applied successfully as a high-quality compact layer for planar PSCs. A positive shift in the flat-band potential (Vfb) and increased conductivity after Nb doping efficiently facilitated photogenerated electron injection and charge extraction from the perovskite film to the 2% Nb-doped TiO2 compact layer, contributing to impressive advances in photovoltaic performance compared with pristine TiO2. Ultimately, a PSC assembled using optimized 2% Nb-doped TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 yielded a power conversion efficiency of up to 16.3%.

In the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have shown striking potential in applications of photovoltaic cells, sensors, light-emitting diodes, lasers, and photodetectors. In the field of organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells, breakthroughs and progress have already been witnessed owing to the intriguing photoactive properties of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) such as a wide absorption range, high extinction coefficient, and long electron–hole diffusion length. Currently, the efficiencies of PSC devices are still constantly increasing, one of which has already risen to the incredible rate of 21.0%.

In general, PSCs have three main types of device architecture: (1) mesoscopic structures using mesoporous semiconducting materials as electron transport layers (ETLs) (e.g. TiO2, WO3, SrTiO3, ZnO, Zn2SnO4 (ref. 17) and SnO2 (ref. 18)), (2) mesosuperstructures employing mesoporous insulators such as Al2O3 (ref. 19) and ZrO2 (ref. 20) as scaffolds while perovskite itself acts as an ETL, and (3) planar structures using ultra-thin compact layer materials (e.g. TiO2, modified TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 (ref. 24 and 25) and WO3 (ref. 26)) for both hole-blocking and electron-conducting purposes. Among these types, planar PSCs are preferred for reasons of a simpler process and lower cost for future applications. In planar PSC devices, the compact layer extracts and transports photogenerated electrons from the perovskite absorber to the FTO (F: SnO2) glass substrate and prevents contact between the FTO and the hole transport layer (HTM). Therefore, high-quality film, appropriate conduction band, and superior electron mobility and conductivity of the compact layer material are responsible for high efficiency in planar PSC devices by reducing excessive charge accumulation and guaranteeing effective electron injection at the compact layer/perovskite interface, which can be achieved by modification of TiO2 such as doping. For instance, Y-doped TiO2 (ref. 4) was utilized as an effective compact layer in a planar PSC device with a high PCE of 19.3% (without a mask). Niobium-doped TiO2, which has been used as a potential transparent conducting oxide (TCO) and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) photoanode, has proved its ability to accelerate electron extraction as an electron mediator in PSCs. Niobium-doped TiO2 for mesoscopic PSC applications has not achieved satisfying PCEs so far; the highest efficiency has been 13.4%. Furthermore, devices assembled using a Nb-doped TiO2 compact layer and mesoporous TiO2 film merely attained a maximum PCE of 10.26%, which was possibly due to the quality of the compact layer and perovskite material.
Here, for the first time, a homogeneous Nb-doped TiO2 nanocolloidal solution was developed to form a high-quality compact layer for efficient perovskite solar devices. Nb doping led to a positive shift in Vfb and a conspicuous improvement in conductivity compared with pristine TiO2. Thus, as expected, electron injection and extraction were substantially enhanced and a significant improvement in PCE (from 14.9% to 16.3%) was witnessed with the optimized 2% Nb doping. Further characterization, such as Mott–Schottky analysis, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), was also carried out to reveal the mechanism behind the enhancement caused by Nb doping.

A Nb-doped TiO2 colloidal solution was prepared according to a modification of the method used for a pristine TiO2 colloidal solution in our previous reports. First, the correct amount of niobium chloride (0.284 mmol, 0.568 mmol, 0.852 mmol, and 1.42 mmol) was added to 10 mL titanium butoxide in different molar ratios (1%, 2%, 3%, and 5%). The dissolution process lasted for a few minutes in a sonication bath until a homogeneous solution was formed. Following that, the uniform solution was added dropwise with stirring to a flask containing acetylacetone (3.41 mL), n-butanol (12.54 mL), para-toluenesulfonic acid (1.27 g) and deionized water before being refluxed at 60 °C for 12 h. A TiO2 colloidal solution was obtained by a similar approach but excluding the addition of niobium chloride.


CH3NH3I was synthesized by blending methylamine (33 wt% in methanol) and hydroiodic acid (57 wt% aqueous) in a molar ratio of 1.5:1 in an ice-water bath with stirring for 2 h, then crystallized by rotary evaporation and purified by recrystallization from diethyl ether before being dried in a vacuum and stored in a N2 atmosphere.


FTO glass (8 Ω square−1) was pretreated with 4 M HCl and zinc powder. The etched substrates were then cleaned with deionized water, alcohol and acetone via an ultrasonic process. The Nb-doped TiO2 compact layer was formed by spin-coating the obtained colloidal solution diluted threefold in anhydrous ethanol at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h in ambient air. A similar approach was used for the pristine TiO2 compact layer. The annealed TiO2 and Nb-doped TiO2 compact layers were immersed in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 minutes before being sintered at 520 °C for 30 minutes. The fabrication of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer on the compact layer was carried out by spin-coating a precursor solution containing 0.88 M PbCl2 and 2.64 M CH3NH3I dissolved in DMF at 5000 rpm for 60 s and annealing at 95 °C for 2 h. An HTM solution comprising 73.2 mg mL−1 spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)/chlorobenzene with the addition of 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) and 17.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSi) solution (520 mg in acetonitrile) was then deposited by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the metal electrode was deposited by magnetron sputtering of gold.


The phase structure was characterized using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (FE-SEM and EDS, JSM-6330F) were utilized to investigate the morphology of PSC devices and the amount of niobium dopants. The morphologies of the surfaces of pristine TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 deposited on FTO glass substrates were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension FastScan). Mott–Schottky plots were obtained using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium) in a standard three-electrode configuration with Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and Pt mesh as the counter electrode in 0.1 M NaCl electrolyte. The frequency was 80 mHz, whereas the amplitude potential was 10 mV. The photovoltaic performance of PSCs was recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a delay time of 100 ms under one-sun AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192), which was calibrated using a NREL standard Si solar cell. The active areas of all solar cells were defined by a 12.56 mm2 metal mask. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained on a Keithley 2000 multimeter as a function of the wavelength from 380 to 850 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. Photoluminescence (PL) (excitation at 406.2 nm) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (excitation at 406.2 nm and emission at 760 nm) spectra were obtained with an Edinburgh Instruments Ltd FLSP920 spectrometer. EIS spectra were also acquired using the electrochemical workstation in the frequency range from 100 mHz to 4 MHz, applying the open-circuit voltage derived from the J–V test and under illumination conditions of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G).


The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine TiO2 and Nb-doped TiO2 with different Nb contents are shown in Fig. 1a and b. It is obvious that the anatase phase is retained in all the samples irrespective of the increase in niobium concentration, whereas the (101) anatase peaks are shifted towards lower values of 2θ (Fig. 1b), which is ascribed to the ionic radius of Nb5+ (0.64 Å) being larger than that of Ti4+ (0.61 Å), according to the Bragg equation 2dsinθ = λ. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S1) demonstrates the presence of Nb in 2% Nb-doped TiO2 film. The XPS spectra of pristine TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 (Fig. 1c) clearly show that the Ti4+ states with a binding energy (BE) of 459.1 eV (pristine TiO2) for the Ti 2p3/2 peak are shifted to 458.9 eV upon Nb doping. Moreover, the Nb5+ state with a BE of 207.2 eV for the 3d5/2 transition is also confirmed, as shown in Fig. 1d. Quantitative analysis of the Nb concentration was performed via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), of which the results (Fig. S2) are in agreement with the theoretical values.

To investigate the changes in electrical properties caused by the introduction of niobium, Mott–Schottky analyses and current–voltage (I–V) measurements were carried out, the results of which are shown in Fig. 2. The carrier density (Nd) can be calculated by fitting a Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. 2a) according to eqn (1) as follows:
Nd = −(2/eε0ε)(d(1/C2)/dV)−1
(1)
where
ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), ε is the dielectric constant of anatase (55 F m−1), and e is the elementary charge. As a result, the obtained values of Nd are displayed in Table 1. It is concluded that the carrier density increases with an increase in the Nb content.

To determine the direct-current conductivity (σ0) of various Nb-doped TiO2 materials, devices composed of ITO/Nb-doped TiO2/Au were fabricated and the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 2b. From eqn (2),
I = σ0AD−1V
(2)
where
A is the area (16 mm2) and D is the thickness (100 nm) of the sample; the calculated values of the direct-current conductivity are summarized in Table 1 and exhibit approximately the same trend as the changes in Nd with different Nb concentrations.

In other words, both Nd and σ0 increase with an increase in the Nb dopant concentration.


Fig. 3a shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a sandwich-like planar PSC device with thicknesses of the compact layer (2% Nb-doped TiO2), perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3), HTM (spiro-OMeTAD), and Au cathode of approximately 80 nm, 250 nm, 150 nm, and 80 nm, respectively. Fig. 3b and S3 present top-view SEM images of perovskite layers deposited on Nb-doped TiO2 compact layers with various dopant contents from 0% to 5%. In comparison with an SEM image of perovskite deposited on pristine TiO2 (ESI, Fig. S3a), it is obvious that even though the pristine TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 compact layers have similar roughnesses (ESI, Fig. S4), perovskite deposited on the 2% Nb-doped TiO2 layer has fewer pinholes. The XRD pattern of perovskite deposited on FTO glass is shown in Fig. S5. The four characteristic peaks identified at 14.5°, 28.5°, 43.2°, and 58.8° are assigned to the (110), (220), (330), and (440) planes of the CH3NH3PbI3 phase, whereas the other four characteristic peaks marked with star symbols are indexed to the (110), (101), (200), and (211) planes of FTO.


The average photovoltaic performance parameters of PSC devices based on Nb-doped TiO2 with various dopant contents are shown in Fig. S6. There is a pronounced increase in Jsc for PSCs based on Nb-doped TiO2 compact layers from 18.8 mA cm−2 (pristine TiO2) to 20.8 mA cm−2 (5%), which can be attributed to the increased carrier density and conductivity upon Nb doping. Nevertheless, the coverage of perovskite deposited on the compact layer is regarded as another factor that influences the entire photovoltaic performance of PSCs. According to the variation in the number of pinholes in Nb-doped TiO2 films at different dopant contents (shown in Fig. 3b and S3), the coverage of perovskite substantially increased from 0% to 2% Nb content, remained nearly the same at 3%, but significantly decreased from 3% to 5%. These findings indicate the variation in FF values from 0% to 5% Nb content. Eventually, 2% Nb-doped TiO2 was selected as an ideal compact layer for planar PSC devices.


Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performing PSC devices based on pristine TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 compact layers, of which the derived performance parameters are shown in Table 2. Thus, the PSC based on 2% Nb-doped TiO2 has an average short-circuit photocurrent density of 20.0 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 999 mV and a fill factor of 0.76, yielding an average efficiency of 15.3%, whereas the PCE of the best-performing device is 16.3%. In the same batch, the PSC based on pristine TiO2 has an average short-circuit photocurrent density of 18.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 987 mV and a fill factor of 0.71, yielding an average PCE of 13.3%, whereas the PCE of the champion cell is 14.9%. It is apparent that the significant increase in PCE relies more on increases in the short-circuit current density and fill factor upon doping with 2% Nb, in contrast to pristine TiO2. Such a variation in Jsc is likely to stem from two effects caused by doping with niobium cations. One is the improvement in the electron injection efficiency resulting from the positive shift in Vfb upon Nb doping, as shown in the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 2a). The other is the increased charge transfer ability due to the increases in carrier density and electron conductivity for 2% Nb-doped TiO2, as displayed in Table 1.

The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) or external quantum efficiency of the planar perovskite solar cells based on TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 compact layers are shown in Fig. 4b, which exhibits an obvious onset of the generation of photocurrent at 780 nm, in accordance with the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3. The corresponding results have revealed high IPCE values along the entire range of wavelengths from 400 nm to 780 nm at 2% Nb content. The integrated current densities from IPCE spectra for TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 are 18.4 mA cm−2 and 19.2 mA cm−2, which are in reasonable agreement with the measured values of Jsc.
To explain the variations in fill factor, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were derived from the J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. It is notable that devices based on a 2% Nb-doped TiO2 ETL have lower values of Rs, which is consistent with the higher FF. Moreover, the Rsh values of these two types of cells are of the same order of magnitude, but a little higher for 2% Nb-doped TiO2. Hence, it is concluded that the Nb-doped TiO2 layer functions well as an electron-transporting layer and a hole-blocking layer owing to its increased carrier density, enhanced electron conductivity and dense morphology.
Both forward and reverse-bias sweeps were used to determine the hysteresis behaviour of PSCs. The hysteresis behaviour is possibly caused by ion migration, ferroelectricity, and imbalances in charge transportation or extraction. According to the J–V curves (Fig. 5a) recorded from forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC) and from short circuit to forward bias (SC-FB), as well as the specific photovoltaic parameters (Table S1) of typical perovskite solar cells based on different compact layers, the PCE for SC-FB is 90.0% of that for FB-SC for the device based on 2% Nb-doped TiO2, but only 81% for that based on pristine TiO2. This result is ascribed to the enhanced charge extraction at the compact layer/perovskite interface as a result of niobium doping. Owing to the efficient charge extraction, the accumulation of charge at the interface was substantially reduced, finally resulting in the reduction in hysteresis of the device based on 2% Nb-doped TiO2.
Stabilized power output under applied bias at the maximum power point is deemed to be another significant parameter that reflects the real sustainable power conversion efficiency of solar cells. Here, by subjecting the best-performing device based on 2% Nb-doped TiO2 to measurements of steady-state current and maximum power output at a forward bias of 800 mV under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight of 100 mW cm−2, a maximum PCE of 15.8% (shown in Fig. 4b) was obtained. However, in the same batch, the device based on pristine TiO2 merely yielded a maximum PCE of 12.0% at a forward bias of 760 mV.

Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out to determine whether or not the photogenerated electrons were efficiently injected from the perovskite film into the compact layer.Fig. 6a shows the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite, TiO2/perovskite and 2% Nb-doped TiO2/perovskite deposited on a blank glass. From the intensity of the photoluminescence peak at 780 nm, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film deposited on 2% Nb-doped TiO2 shows more evident PL quenching compared with pristine TiO2 film, which proves that Nb doping has successfully increased the rate of carrier extraction at the compact layer/perovskite interface. Furthermore, time constants τe were obtained by fitting TRPL curves (Fig. 6b) to determine the exciton lifetime of perovskite on different electrodes. As a result, the fitted time constants τe of perovskite film, TiO2/perovskite and 2% Nb-doped TiO2/perovskite are calculated to be 18.7, 2.42 and 1.96 ns, respectively. Thus, compared with pristine TiO2, the PL decay of 2% Nb-doped TiO2 is approximately 19% faster, which indicates that the time needed for electron injection from perovskite film into 2% Nb-doped TiO2 is shorter than that into pristine TiO2. The enhanced electron injection, which is possibly ascribed to the positive shift in Vfb upon Nb doping, contributes to more efficient extraction of photogenerated carriers at the compact layer/perovskite interface, resulting in the increased PCE.

EIS measurements were also carried out to acquire a better understanding of the interfacial charge transport processes and recombination dynamics of PSC devices based on pristine TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2. Fig. S7 displays Nyquist plots for these two cells measured at their own open-circuit potential under one-sun AM 1.5G illumination. According to the Nyquist plots, two distinct RC arcs are observed; the small semicircle in the high-frequency range (left) is assigned to hole diffusion in the HTM layer, whereas the large semicircle at low frequency (right) is attributed to the recombination process. A traditional simplest equivalent circuit (shown inside Fig. S7) is used to fit the data in the Nyquist plots. The fitted values of Rseries and the recombination resistance (Rrec) are tabulated in Table S2. The values of Rseries of the devices based on TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 compact layers measured by EIS are 17.8 and 8.7 Ω cm2, respectively. Because the FTO layer, perovskite film, HTM layer and Au film of both devices were fabricated in the same process, the decrease in Rseries is primarily attributed to the increased conductivity upon doping with 2% Nb. This decreased value of Rseries for 2% Nb-doped TiO2 contributes to the increase in the FF compared with that of pristine TiO2. In addition, the calculated values of Rrec for PSCs based on TiO2 and 2% Nb-doped TiO2 films are 610.1 and 691.5 Ω cm2, respectively, which indicates a reduction in recombination for the latter owing to the increased charge transfer rate. These findings can be ascribed to the positive shift in the conduction band, which reduces energy loss and facilitates the injection of photogenerated electrons. Because the open-circuit voltage of a planar perovskite solar device has been discovered to rely more on perovskite itself rather than the conduction band energy of the metal oxide compact layer, it is reasonable that devices based on 2% Nb-doped TiO2 should achieve a higher open-circuit voltage as a result of reduced recombination, regardless of the small variation in potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the compact layer and the HTM, which is slightly different from DSSCs. In conclusion, niobium doping leads to an increase in film conductivity and a reduction in recombination resistance, which contribute to substantial increases in FF, Jsc and Voc.

In summary, a simple, low-cost, homogeneous Nb-doped TiO2 nanocolloidal solution has been developed for forming a high-quality compact layer for efficient perovskite solar devices. Upon optimization of the Nb dopant content, the optimal 2% Nb-doped TiO2 compact layer has demonstrated a PCE of as high as 16.3% (Jsc = 20.4 mA cm−2, Voc = 1036 mV, and FF = 0.77) measured with a stabilized maximum power output at an efficiency of 15.8%, which is a record for PSCs based on a Nb-doped TiO2 compact layer at present. Niobium doping leads to impressive increases in carrier density and film conductivity and a positive shift in Vfb. Such improvements lend crucial support to the enhanced injection and extraction of photogenerated electrons at the compact layer/perovskite interface, which sequentially trigger remarkable increases in Jsc and FF. Niobium doping also contributes to enhanced PL quenching and a faster PL decay time owing to the improved extraction of photogenerated electrons. In general, the fabrication and optimization of Nb-doped TiO2 offer significant potential in the search for alternative compact layers that possess matching band gaps and enhanced conductivity with prospects for high-performance PSC devices.
