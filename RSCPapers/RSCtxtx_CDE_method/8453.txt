Herein, we demonstrate a kind of high performance semi-transparent polymer solar cell (STPSC) with a significantly improved color rendering index (CRI) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) by introducing one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs), which are intentionally designed to strongly reflect the pristine weak absorbed light to flatten the concavo-convex transmittance spectrum of STPSCs. The transmitted light from the STPSC device with 4 pairs of 1DPCs under AM 1.5G illumination shows extraordinary color rendering capacities, which contribute an increased CRI from 79 to 91, combined with an enhanced PCE from 4.14% to 5.01% compared to devices without 1DPCs. The simultaneously improved optical and electrical performance suggests that STPSCs can provide a unique feature, which is suitable for building integrated photovoltaic applications.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted more and more attention due to their potential advantages over inorganic solar cells, such as low cost, lightweight, easy fabrication and flexibility. To realize commercialization and industrialization, PSCs need to exhibit high efficiency and unique applications in contrast to inorganic solar cells. In order to achieve high efficiency, some strategies have been adopted to overcome the narrow absorption and low drift mobility shortcomings of polymers. For example, low bandgap polymer synthesis, interface engineering and tandem structure design have been developed to increase light utilization and improve charge transportation. Recent developments in tandem structures led to promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 10%.

At the same time, the unique applications of PSCs have also been investigated. Due to advantages such as the ability to be fabricated with two transparent electrodes and controllable transmittance, semitransparent PSCs (STPSCs) have become some of the most promising candidates for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). BIPVs are a novel application of solar energy, which has been considered as an attractive research area based on the combination of large area building and huge photovoltaic market. In the past few decades, the investigation of STPSCs has been focused on seeking different light trapping structures and active layer materials to optimize the efficiency and transmittance simultaneously, which are often contradictory to each other due to the different thickness requirements of the active layer. However, STPSCs with high efficiency and transmittance cannot meet BIPV application requirements, such as building aesthetics and natural transmitted light. The most desired feature of STPSCs for BIPV applications is their capability to provide neutral colour light for everyday lighting needs. This means that the light transmitted through the STPSC window should retain the neutral color properties of the incident light source, such as the Sun or a lamp. Hence, the color feature of STPSCs has been considered in recently reported papers. The first study on the color feature of a STPSC was published in 2010, which simply depicted the color coordination of the device in color space. Then, in order to express the variation degree between transmitted light and incident light, the color rendering index (CRI) concept was introduced into STPSC representation. The neutral color degree of transmitted light is dependent on the calculated value of the CRI. In order to achieve a higher CRI, some strategies have been reported, such as the utilization of low bandgap absorbers, the utilization of tandem structures with complementary absorbers, and the incorporation of dyes in STPSCs. However, the obtained higher CRI was always accompanied by lower PCE. For example, by incorporating dyes as complementary absorbing materials with an active layer polymer, the CRI value of 95 was achieved. But the PCE is too low (1.86%) for applications owing to the reduction in the work function of PEDOT:PSS and corresponding decreased Voc. The reduction in the work function of PEDOT:PSS is attributed to the fact that the dye is an ionic organic complex comprising sodium. On the other hand, though the CRIs of these reported devices are improved, the chromaticity difference (DC) is still higher than the tolerance of CRI calculations. According to the CRI definition, the calculated CRI will become less accurate if the DC is larger than 0.0054. Consequently, achieving a high CRI combined with a DC lower than 0.0054 for STPSCs is a challenge for BIPV application.
As we all know, the most widely used polymer in bulk-heterojunction PSCs is poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT). But for STPSCs, P3HT is not an excellent absorber due to its narrow absorption, which is induced by the wide bandgap of about 2.0 eV. Because of the strong absorption of the green light wavelength, the P3HT-based STPSC exhibits a crimson color, which results in a low CRI, thus limiting the BIPV application. In this paper, we demonstrate a neutral colour P3HT-based STPSC with a simultaneously improved CRI and PCE by introducing one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) as Bragg reflectors ([WO3/LiF]pairs) on top of the STPSC. The indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) is used as an electron acceptor which has a higher LUMO energy level of −3.74 eV than that of PCBM (−3.91 eV). 1DPCs are used to level the concavo-convex transmittance spectrum induced by the absorption of P3HT:ICBA. The photonic bandgap center is designed as 680 nm, which is just in accordance with the weak absorption region of P3HT:ICBA. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the CRI is increased from 78 to 91 and the DC is decreased from 0.0270 to 0.0035, which is lower than 0.0054, and PCE is enhanced from 4.14% to 5.01% with 4 pairs of 1DPCs. This work shows the potential of the STPSC technology to provide a neutral uniform color for BIPV applications.

The device structure is shown in Fig. 1 and the preparation process is described as follows. The reference STPSC structure is Glass/ITO(150 nm)/PEI(5 nm)/P3HT:ICBA(80 nm)/WO3(10 nm)/Ag(15 nm). The 1DPC-based STPSC structure is the reference STPSC/[WO3/LiF]pairs. Firstly, the ITO glass substrate was cleaned with acetone, ethanol and de-ionized water for 30 min respectively. Then, a 5 nm-thick PEI (Aladdin Industrial Corporation) layer was spun coated on top of the ITO glass substrate, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min under continuous nitrogen flow. P3HT (Lumtec Corp) and ICBA (Lumtec Corp) were dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene to produce 20 mg ml−1 solution in a 1:1 weight ratio and stirred for two days in a glove box. P3HT:ICBA thin film was prepared by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in a glove box. Then, 10 nm WO3 and 15 nm Ag were deposited in sequence under 5 × 10−4 Pa vacuum. In order to define the active area of the STPSC, the Ag top electrode was deposited through a shadow mask. The dimension of the STPSC was 0.064 cm2. For the STPSC with 1DPCs, the different pairs of WO3 (81.7 nm)/LiF (118.1 nm) were alternately evaporated under vacuum (5 × 10−4 Pa) and the rate of deposition was about 1 nm s−1. The pairs of 1DPCs are 2, 3, 4, and 5. 1 pair of 1DPCs is not considered here because there are only two layers with 1 pair of 1DPCs. It cannot be recognized as the multilayer 1DPCs.

The absorption, transmittance and reflectance spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet/visible spectrometer (UV1700, Shimadzu). J –V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2601 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination with an Oriel 300 W solar simulator intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Light source intensity was measured using a photometer (International light, IL1400). IPCE was measured using a Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD. The calculation of device color perception is compiled using Spectra Win software by our team.

Firstly, the absorption spectrum of P3HT:ICBA and the reflectance spectra of 1DPCs are recorded and shown in Fig. 2a. It can be seen that the absorption cutoff of P3HT:ICBA film is 650 nm, which reveals that STPSCs with the P3HT:ICBA active layer always exhibit the crimson color. In order to tune the color of P3HT:ICBA-based STPSCs towards a neutral color (no special color) to satisfy the application requirements, 1DPCs, which are known to be multilayer reflectors, are introduced on top of pristine STPSCs as wavelength-dependent filters. As a matter of fact, 1DPCs exhibit a photonic bandgap with an infinite period if there is a great difference in the refractive indices of the constituent materials. The photonic bandgap means photons with energies lying in the bandgap cannot propagate through the 1DPCs and will be reflected back. Here, WO3 and LiF were chosen as the constituent materials due to their different refractive index. We define the thickness and the refractive index of these two materials as d1, d2, n1 and n2 respectively. The relationship between n1, n2, d1 and d2 for a 1DPC is given as n1d1 = n2d2 = λ0/4, where λ0 is the center wavelength of the 1DPC photonic bandgap and set as λ0 = 680 nm here. The refractive index of WO3 and LiF is 2.08(n1) and 1.44(n2), respectively. According to the above relationship, the thickness of WO3 and LiF is 81.7 nm and 118.1 nm respectively. For the application of STPSCs, the photonic bandgap of 1DPCs used here is intentionally not completely formed in order to keep specific light transmitting. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the reflectance of 1DPCs increases gradually and the corresponding transmittance decreases as the number of pairs of WO3/LiF increases. The boundary between the reflectance region and the transmittance region gradually becomes distinct. It is clearly seen that the reflectance range of 1DPCs corresponds to the weak absorption range of P3HT. This suggests that 1DPCs with a complementary reflectance spectrum can balance the transmittance spectrum and improve the CRI of STPSCs by reflecting the light which cannot be absorbed by P3HT.

To determine the effect of 1DPCs on the transmittance balance, the total device transmittance spectra of corresponding STPSCs with different pairs of 1DPCs are illustrated in Fig. 3. Owing to the narrow absorption band of the active layer, the transmittance spectrum shape of the control device without 1DPCs is concavo-convex. For devices with different pairs of 1DPCs, the shapes of the spectra changed remarkably, showing the tuneable transparency using the 1DPC reflector. In perceptual intuition, the transmittance of the wavelength higher than 580 nm is changed obviously. For the device without 1DPCs, the transmittance of the wavelength higher than 580 nm presents an increasing trend combined with a peak at 650 nm. With 2 pairs of 1DPCs, the peak is levelled up, because the photonic bandgap is not formed, and they only act as anti-reflection layers. The transmittance is enlarged by the anti-reflection effect. With more than 3 pairs of 1DPCs, the peak height of the wavelength higher than 580 nm in the transmittance curve is levelled down because the light within the peak of the transmittance curve is partly reflected and partly transmitted by 1DPCs because the photonic bandgap of 1DPCs is gradually formed. As seen in Fig. 2a, the distinction and boundary between the transmittance region and the reflectance region appear. For the transmittance of the wavelength lower than 580 nm, the value changed a little for the device with 1DPCs though the shape is varied by 1DPCs. Hence, the amplitude of the transmittance spectra is decreased and becomes more uniform with more than 3 pairs of 1DPCs. The average transmittance (AVT) in the visible region (380–780 nm) is presented in Table 1. It can be seen that the AVT is improved for the device with 2 pairs of 1DPC anti-reflection films and decreased for the device with more than 3 pairs of 1DPCs. However, the lowest AVT for 5 pairs of 1DPCs still meets the application requirements for transmittance.

Such variation in the transmittance spectra shows that the color perception of transmitted light will be changed. The color perception can be expressed using the CRI. To determine the CRI of the device quantitatively, we calculate the color coordinates (x and y) on CIE 1931 color space and (u, v) on CIE 1960 uniform color space from the transmittance spectra (Fig. 4). In the calculations, the light source chosen is the AM 1.5G illumination light source and the standard illuminant D65 light source. The transmitted light is represented by the product of the transmittance spectrum of each STPSC and an AM 1.5G illumination light source and a standard illuminant D65 light source. Fig. 4a represents the position of color coordinates of each device illuminated by the AM 1.5G illumination light source on CIE 1931 color space and it is magnified in Fig. 4b. When the light of AM 1.5G illumination is transmitted through the STPSC device without 1DPCs (0 pair), the color of transmitted light is located on the CIE 1931 color space (0.3317, 0.2926), which is far away from the Planckian locus (black body locus). With 2 pairs of 1DPCs, the color coordinate shifted away to the Planckian locus due to the anti-reflection effect. With more pairs of 1DPCs, the color coordinate is closer to the Planckian locus. Because of the uniform color of CIE 1931 color space, the same distance on the CIE 1931 color space does not mean the same color change. So, in order to illustrate the color change, the color coordinates (u, v) and the Planckian locus on the CIE 1960 uniform color space are also given in Fig. 4c for an AM 1.5G illumination light source. In Fig. 4c, the color coordinates of devices are similar to those in Fig. 4b. But the distance between the color coordinate and the Planckian locus can express the transmitted light color change intuitively. For the device without 1DPCs, the color coordinate is far away from the Planckian locus. But for the device with 3, 4, and 5 pairs of 1DPCs, the color coordinates are located more closely to the Planckian locus. The color coordinates of devices under the illumination of a standard illuminant D65 light source are also given in Fig. 4d and e on CIE 1931 color space. The CIE 1960 uniform color space (Fig. 4f) is also given in order to prove the same result that the color coordinate is changed by 1DPCs and it is also closer to the Planckian locus. We can see that the relative position of the color coordinate is all the same for both CIE 1960 and CIE 1931 color space.
Only when the color coordinate is near to the Planckian locus, the discussion of the CRI of transmitted light is meaningful. Hence, before CRI discussion, the DC calculation is significant because the CRI is considered to be meaningful only if the color coordinates lie within a chromaticity difference DC of < 0.0054 from the reference illuminant as recommended by Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE, in French). According to the CRI calculation of the CIE definition, we use the black body radiator (BBR) on the Planckian locus with the same correlated color temperature (CCT) as the reference illuminant. CCT is the color temperature of the nearest point on the Planckian locus, whose color most closely resembles that of a given stimulus under specified viewing conditions and at the same brightness. The calculated DCs are listed in Table 1 under the illumination of both an AM 1.5G illumination light source and a standard illuminant D65 light source. As shown in Fig. 5a, for the device without 1DPCs under AM 1.5G illumination, the DC reaches up to 0.0270, which is much higher than 0.0054, hence the CRI is less meaningful. With 3, 4 and 5 pairs of 1DPCs, the DCs are all lower than 0.0054, indicating that the transmitted light approaches the BBR.
The decline of DCs means an improved CRI. The CRI is an effective measurement of the ability of a light source to reveal the colors of various objects compared to an ideal or a natural light source, which is defined by the CIE. Here, the CRI accounts for the transmitted light color perception of STPSCs. STPSCs with a high CRI are desirable for window integration applications. Here, the test sample method (TSM) is used to analyse CRI perception. Firstly, we calculated the CRIi of eight test color samples (TCSs) (1–8), whose CRI is the average of CRIi. The CRIi values of 8 TCSs of different devices illuminated by an AM 1.5G illumination light source are shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that the CRIi values of devices with 3, 4, and 5 pairs of 1DPCs are higher than devices without 1DPCs and with 2 pairs of 1DPCs. Correspondingly, an improved CRI is expected. The average CRI of all devices are calculated and shown in Fig. 5a and Table 1. It is obvious that the CRI is improved by 1DPCs from 78 to 90, 91 and 89 corresponding to 3, 4, and 5 pairs of 1DPCs. Hence, the optimal CRI of 91 with a DC of 0.0035 is achieved by STPSCs with 4 pairs of 1DPCs. The total transmittance of the wavelength higher than 600 nm is gradually decreased with 3, 4, and 5 pairs of 1DPCs. With 3 pairs of 1DPCs, the decline of transmittance is not enough to level the total transmittance spectrum. With 5 pairs of 1DPCs, the CRI decreased slightly because too many pairs of 1DPCs induced transmittance decline, which brought down the total transmittance. The optimal pair of 1DCP is 4 because of the best level of the transmittance spectrum. For a standard illuminant D65 light source, the DC, CRI and CRIi are illustrated in Fig. 5c and d. The results obtained show that the optimal pairs are 4, which are consistent with the AM 1.5G illumination light source. For the device with 4 pairs of 1DPCs, the DC is decreased from 0.0250 to 0.0052, and the CRI is increased from 78 to 92. Overall, the CRIi for 4 pairs of 1DPCs is higher than devices without 1DPCs.
To understand the CRI calculation process, TCS color coordinates on CIE 1931 color space and on CIE 1960 uniform color space of the transmitted light under AM 1.5G illumination for devices without 1DPCs and with 4 pairs of 1DPCs are shown in Fig. 6a and b. Along the anticlockwise start point of the TCS circle, the one by one point represents TCS1–TCS8. Accordingly, we calculated the values of CCT to be 5519 K for the device without 1DPCs and 6902 K for the device with 4 pairs of 1DPCs. So, according to the CCT of the device, different reference BBR sources to illuminate the TCS presumptively are chosen and the color coordinates of the corresponding BBR reflected by each TCS are also calculated. We can visually determine the CRI by comparing the color coordinate distance of the same TCS of the device and the BBR. It is obvious that the TCS color coordinates on both the CIE 1931 color space and the CIE 1960 uniform color space of the device without 1DPCs are far away from the TCSs illuminated by the reference 5519 BBR source both in the two color space, which indicates the poor CRI of about 78. As implied by the excellent CRI of 91, the color coordinates of TCSs illuminated by the transmitted light of the device with 4 pairs of 1DPCs are close to the TCSs illuminated by the reference 6902 K BBR both on the CIE 1931 color space and the CIE 1960 uniform color space, clearly demonstrating the superior color perception of STPSCs with 4 pairs of 1DPCs.


Fig. 7a shows the J–V characteristics of STPSC devices with different pairs of 1DPCs. The detailed data are shown in Table 1 and the errors are calculated for 100 devices. The device without 1DPCs typically exhibits a PCE of 4.14% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.15 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.5%. The device with 4 pairs of 1DPCs exhibits an improved PCE of 5.01% with a Jsc of 8.62 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and a FF of 66.8%. By continuously increasing the number of pairs of 1DPCs, the PCE of 5.12% is obtained, with a Jsc of 8.79 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and a FF of 67.0%. The highest PCE is caused by the lowest transmittance, which means more light can be absorbed by the active layer. It is clearly observed that the Voc and FF of the devices are almost the same, which implies that they are independent of 1DPCs. Meanwhile, the Jsc is remarkably improved by 1DPCs, which is attributed to absorption enhancement. It has been shown that the improvement of Jsc is induced by varied transmittance spectra of devices. Hence, the IPCE spectra of devices are also recorded to determine the photocurrent variation trend with increasing pairs of 1DPCs, which are shown in Fig. 7b. Compared to the total transmittance of devices, the IPCE shapes of different devices are in line with the transmittance spectra of 1DPCs. When the transmittance is higher, the IPCE is lower at the corresponding wavelength. The IPCE spectra of devices with 4 and 5 pairs of 1DPCs show obvious enhancements compared to the device without 1DPCs. The improvement of IPCE is attributed to the second round light absorption caused by the reflectance of 1DPCs. Hence, the improvement of device electrical performance is owing to the reflectance of 1DPCs. In other words, it is clearly shown that the STPSC device with intentionally designed 1DPCs can achieve not only an excellent CRI and a low DC, but also an increased PCE.


The optical electric field distribution (|E(x)|2), which is calculated using the transferred matrix method (TMM), is shown in Fig. 8 to investigate photocurrent improvement resulting from 1DPCs. In optical simulations, each layer of PSCs is represented by its complex refractive index (n + ik). n and k denote the refractive index and the extinction coefficient, which are acquired by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE). All layers are assumed to be planar and isotropic. The absorption in the active layer is neglected. As shown in Fig. 8, the |E(x)|2 in the active layer of the device with 4 pairs of 1DPCs (Fig. 8b) is much higher than that of the device without 1DPCs (Fig. 8a), especially at wavelengths above 580 nm. Since the reflectance of 1DPCs was strengthened in the wavelength range of 580–780 nm as the number of pairs of 1DPCs increased, a stronger optical electric field is expected, which is caused by the light reflected by 1DPCs. The stronger optical electric field can improve the absorption of the device at the corresponding wavelength. Hence, the IPCE spectra of STPSCs are gradually enhanced and an improvement in Jsc can also be achieved. In addition, the optical electric field of the device with 5 pairs of 1DPCs is also shown in Fig. 8c. The strongest optical electric field suggests the highest PCE, which is in accordance with the J–V measurement results.


In conclusion, we demonstrate an excellent STPSC with simultaneously improved PCE and CRI by introducing one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs). To purposefully design the centre wavelength of 1DPCs, the concavo-convex transmittance spectrum caused by active layer absorption was filled and almost levelled up. To determine the 1DPC induced CRI enhancement, the AM 1.5G illumination light source and the standard illuminant D65 light source are utilized for CRI calculations. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the CRI is significantly improved from 79 to 91, and the PCE is enhanced from 4.14% to 5.01%. The IPCE and optical electric field distribution provide direct evidence that the PCE enhancement results from enhanced absorption. In other words, 1DPCs can improve not only optical but also electrical performance of STPCSs. This method holds great promise for future BIPV applications.
