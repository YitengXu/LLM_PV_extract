Two triphenylamine-based homopolymers PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2, comprising diethyl phosphonate and sodium phosphonate end groups on side chains, respectively, were synthesized. The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2 are mainly determined by the conjugated poly(triphenylamine) main chain. The PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2 possess comparable HOMO levels of around −5.03 eV. The PTPA-EP, with better solubility than PTPA-PO3Na2 in hydrophilic solvents, was utilized as cathode interlayer to construct efficient bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic cells with a low bandgap poly(2,7-carbazole) (PCDTBT) as the polymer donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor. The work function of ITO was shifted to −4.3 eV by PTPA-EP, which matches well with the LUMO level of PC71BM for good electron extraction. Inverted solar cells with a device configuration of ITO/PTPA-EP/active layer/MoO3/Al exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.59%, which is a good efficiency among inverted solar cells with an organic interlayer on an ITO cathode. The PCE shows a 79% increase in comparison to that of a bare ITO cathode, though the efficiency is lower than 5.13% for an inverted solar cell with an inorganic ZnO interlayer on ITO. Moreover, a conventional solar cell with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PTPA-EP/Al could show a better PCE of 5.27%. The results indicate that PTPA-EP is a promising new cathode interlayer for high efficiency inverted and conventional solar cells.

Conjugated polyelectrolytes or hydrophilic conjugated polymers comprise an electronically delocalized backbone with surfactant-like pendant groups. Their delocalized electronic backbones inherit the common semiconducting properties of conjugated polymers. The pendant side chains with hydrophilic groups can make the conjugated polymers exhibit some unique and interesting properties. Particularly, these conjugated polymers can be dissolved in many hydrophilic solvents. Some pendant groups have chemical or biological interactions with specific target molecules. Meanwhile, the conjugated backbones can exhibit quick and efficient intra-chain and/or inter-chain energy transfer, which make them new fluorescent materials with good sensitivities for chemical and biological detection. Moreover, it is also possible to deposit the hydrophilic conjugated polymers on an organic active layer to fabricate multilayer optoelectronic devices, which function as a solution-processed electrode interlayer.

Excellent electron injections by hydrophilic conjugated polymers as the interlayer, in combinations with high work-function Al, Ag, and Au as the cathode in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), have been extensively investigated. In some cases, higher efficiency with the interlayer/metal as the bilayer cathode than that of low work function metals could be achieved. So far, alcohol/water-soluble polyfluorenes, with ammonium,diethanolamino, and phosphonate pendants, are the early and widely introduced examples of PLEDs. Recently, bilayer cathodes were introduced to improve bulk-heterojunction solar cells with a conventional device configuration. Largely elevated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to ∼80% and high efficiency solar cells with PCEs over 6% have been demonstrated. Simultaneous improvements of open-circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), in comparison with those of Al or Ca/Al cathodes, could be achieved. It was proposed that the modified contacts by the hydrophilic interlayer polymer, through enhanced interactions with the active layer and the metal cathode, would recover the existed Voc loss and enhance the electron extraction from the acceptor phase to the metal cathode (with the possibility to decrease hole–electron recombination in the active layer). Thus a bilayer cathode would be highly valuable for device configuration to achieve a target PCE of 8–10% by judicious selection of a high performance polymer donor and a polymer interlayer.
It is of interest for polymer chemists to develop new hydrophilic conjugated polymers. Very recently, hydrophilic polythiophenes and polycarbazoles were synthesized as cathode interlayer for PLEDs and solar cells. Relatively, hydrophilic poly(triphenylamines) (PTPA) received much less attention. In a previous report, PTPA copolymers with sodium sulfonate as the hydrophilic group displayed good hole injection from the ITO anode to the emissive layer in PLEDs. However, to the best of our knowledge, a PTPA-based interlayer for solar cells was not reported.
In this work, we designed and synthesized PTPA homopolymers toward photovoltaic applications. As shown in Scheme 1, PTPA-EP comprising diethyl phosphonate was obtained by a Suzuki coupling reaction of monomers 5 and 6. Furthermore, PTPA-EP could be transferred to PTPA-PO3Na2, a new anionic polyelectrolyte. UV-vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and electrochemical properties of the polymers were characterized. Although our attempt to spin-coat a smooth film of a PTPA-PO3Na2 solution failed because of its very limited solubility in hydrophilic solvents, the solubility of PTPA-EP was enough to form a cathode interlayer to construct efficient polymer solar cells with inverted and conventional device configurations. The active layer of the solar cells was based on a low bandgap poly(2,7-carbazole-alt-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) as the polymer donor and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor with a 1:4 blend ratio. It is expected that the hydrophilic ethyl phosphonate groups on the side chains of PTPA-EP may establish good interfacial contacts with the inorganic ITO cathode in inverted solar cells as well as the Al cathode in conventional solar cells. Indeed, using PTPA-EP as the interlayer on an ITO cathode, the inverted solar cell (ITO/PTPA-EP/active layer/MoO3/Al) showed a PCE of 4.59%, a good efficiency among inverted solar cells with an organic interlayer on the ITO cathode. The conventional solar cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PTPA-EP/Al) could display a higher PCE of 5.27%. The results suggest that PTPA-EP is a promising new cathode interlayer for both inverted and conventional solar cells.

All reagents and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Aldrich, Acros, and TCI Chemical Co. and were used as received. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was distilled over sodium/benzophenone under N2 prior to use. All manipulations involving air-sensitive reagents were performed under an atmosphere of dry argon. N,N-Bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-methoxyphenylamine (1),N,N-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-hydroxyphenylamine (2), and PCDTBT were prepared according to the literature.



Potassium hydroxide (0.67 g, 12.0 mmol) in 30 mL of methanol was added dropwise to N,N-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-hydroxyphenylamine (2) (4.19 g, 10.0 mmol) in 30 mL of methanol under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and then added to 1,6-dibromohexane (7.32 g, 30.0 mmol) in 60 mL of ethanol. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The organic phase was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL), washed successively with water, and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removal of the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography (dichloromethane/petroleum ether = 1:8 as the eluent) to give the title compound as a colorless liquid (4.54 g, 78%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.30 (d, 4H), 7.02 (d, 2H), 6.91–6.82 (m, 6H), 3.96 (t, 2H), 3.43 (t, 2H), 1.90 (m, 2H), 1.81 (m, 2H), 1.55–1.50 (m, 4H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz), δ (ppm): 156.3, 146.8, 139.6, 132.2, 127.4, 124.3, 115.6, 114.5, 68.0, 33.7, 32.7, 29.1, 27.9, 25.3.

The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C for 8 h under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the organic layer was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL), washed successively with water, and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The residue was purified by column chromatography (dichloromethane/petroleum ether = 1:2 as the eluent) and recrystallized from THF/ethanol to give the final compound as a white solid (2.74 g, 81%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.65 (d, 4H), 7.07–7.01 (m, 6H), 6.83 (d, 2H), 3.95 (t, 2H), 3.3 (t, 2H), 1.90 (m, 2H), 1.81 (m, 2H), 1.55–1.50 (m, 4H), 1.33 (s, 24H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz), δ (ppm): 156.3, 150.3, 139.8, 135.8, 128.0, 121.7, 115.4, 83.6, 68.0, 33.7, 32.7, 29.2, 27.9, 25.3, 24.9.

A solution of N,N-bis-(4-bromophenyl)-4-(6-bromohexyloxy)-phenylamine (3) (1.75 g, 3.0 mmol), in triethyl phosphite was heated to 140 °C under an argon atmosphere for 24 h. Then the excess triethyl phosphite was distilled in a vacuum, and the crude product was purified by silica chromatography (ethyl acetate/ether = 1:2) to give the title compound as a colorless liquid (1.78 g, 93%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.29 (d, 4H), 6.99 (d, 2H), 6.90–6.80 (m, 6H), 4.14–4.03 (m, 4H), 3.92 (t, 2H), 1.80–1.64 (m, 6H), 1.48–1.47 (m, 4H), 1.32 (t, 6H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz), δ (ppm): 156.3, 146.8, 139.6, 132.1, 127.4, 124.3, 115.6, 114.5, 68.0, 61.5, 30.4, 29.0, 26.6, 25.6, 22.4, 16.5.

The mixture was refluxed with vigorous stirring for 3 days under an argon atmosphere. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, the organic layer was extracted with toluene (50 mL), washed successively with water, and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solution was filtered through a funnel and then precipitated into 250 mL of hexane. The resulting solid material was washed successively with hexane for 24 h and dried in vacuum to afford the title polymer as a light green solid (419 mg, 61%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3), δ (ppm): 7.47–7.41 (br, 4H), 7.16–7.09 (br, 6H), 6.87–6.84 (br, 2H), 4.15–4.03 (m, 4H), 3.96–3.92 (br, 2H), 1.78–1.65 (m, 6H), 1.48–1.47 (br, 4H), 1.34–1.30 (t, 6H).

The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 5 h and then quenched by 5.0 mL of methanol and 5.0 mL of 2 M NaOH in methanol. A precipitate was formed and collected by filtration. The polymer was dialyzed using a membrane with a 7500 molecular weight cutoff for 3 days. The final product was obtained after drying in vacuum as a light green solid (126 mg, 86%). Anal. Calcd (%) for (C24H24NNa2O4P)n: C, 61.67; H, 5.14; N, 3.00. Found: C, 61.51; H, 5.29; N, 2.92.



1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 300 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL elemental analysis instrument (Elementar Co.). Molecular weights of the polymers were obtained on a Waters GPC 2410 using a calibration curve of polystyrene standards, with tetrahydrofuran as the eluent. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The PL spectra of the copolymer were obtained on a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a CHI 660A electrochemical workstation with platinum electrodes at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 against a saturated calomel reference electrode with a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile (CH3CN). The deposition of a copolymer on the electrode was done by the evaporation of a dilute THF solution. The work function was determined using a scanning Kelvin probe system SKP 5050 (KP Technology).


Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 15–20 ohm/square was cleaned by a surfactant scrub, then underwent a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with deionized water, followed by acetone and isopropanol. For the fabrication of the inverted solar cells, DMF solution of PTPA-EP was spin-coated on the top of the ITO substrate and dried at 120 °C for 10 min to form a thin interlayer of 10 nm. Determination of the thickness of the interlayer followed a previously published paper. The active layer (PCDTBT:PC71BM = 1:4), with a thickness of 65 nm, was then deposited on top of the interlayer, by casting from a solution with a mixed solvent of dichlorobenzene:chlorobenzene = 3:1, and drying at 60 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the active layer was verified by a surface profilometer (Tencor, Alpha-500). At a base pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa, a 10 nm MoO3 layer was thermally evaporated at an evaporation rate of 0.1 Å s−1. Finally, a 100 nm aluminum layer was evaporated with a shadow mask. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined a pixel size of 0.16 cm2. The thickness values of the evaporated MoO3 and Al were monitored by a quartz crystal thickness/ratio monitor (Model: STM-100/MF, Sycon). The conventional solar cell with PTPA-EP as the cathode interlayer was fabricated according to a previous report, in which the PTPA-EP interlayer was spin-coated from a methanol solution, on top of the active layer. All the fabrication processes were carried out inside a controlled atmosphere of a nitrogen dry-box (Vacuum Atmosphere Co.) containing less than 10 ppm oxygen and moisture. The power conversion efficiencies of the resulting inverted solar cells were measured under illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light (Oriel model 91192) at 80 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2410 source unit. The external quantum efficiencies of the inverted PVCs were measured with a commercial photomodulation spectroscopic setup, including a xenon lamp, an optical chopper, a monochromator, and a lock-in amplifier operated by a PC computer, and a calibrated Si photodiode was used as a standard.


The synthetic routes for monomers are shown in Scheme 1. Intermediates 1 and 2 were prepared according to a previous report. In the presence of an excess amount of 1,6-dibromohexane, N,N-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-hydroxyphenylamine 2 could be transformed to the triphenylamine derivative 3 with a 6-bromohexyloxy group in 78% yield. The diboronic ester compound 4 with a total yield of 81% after recrystallization in THF/ethanol mixture was synthesized by Miyaura coupling of 3 and bis(pinacolato)diboron with PdCl2(dppf) as the catalyst. A heating reaction of 3 and 4 in triethyl phosphite at 140 °C readily afforded 5 and 6 with diethyl phosphonate end group in high yields of 93% and 90%, respectively. The chemical structures of intermediates 3 and 4 as well as monomers 5 and 6 were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis (see the Experimental section for details).


Scheme 1 also shows the polymerization of PTPA-EP. The preparation of PTPA-EP was accomplished viaPd(PPh3)4-catalyzed Suzuki reaction of the corresponding monomers 5 and 6. PTPA-EP can be dissolved in hydrophilic solvents such as THF, DMF, DMSO, and methanol. Measured by GPC with calibration of polystyrene standards and THF as the eluent, the number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) of PTPA-EP was 11900, with polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 1.5. The chemical structure of PTPA-EP was confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis.

Hydrolysis of the diethyl phosphonate polymer PTPA-EP with trimethylsilyl bromide and NaOH in methanol solution afforded the desired anionic polymer PTPA-PO3Na2. The final product was obtained by dialyzing in a membrane with a 7500 cutoff. The molecular weight of PTPA-PO3Na2 should be comparable with its precursor due to a high transformation yield of 86%. However, the transformation reaction greatly changed the solubility of the polymer. PTPA-PO3Na2 was insoluble in most organic solvents like THF, toluene, DMF, and DMSO. The polymer was partially soluble in water and methanol, with limited solubility. 1H NMR measurement of PTPA-PO3Na2 in D2O only showed broad signals, indicating that the polymer chains form aggregates in water. Our attempt to spin-coat a smooth film with a PTPA-PO3Na2 “solution” thus failed. Maybe, a copolymer design or a decreased molecular weight of the precursor PTPA-EP would be necessary so as to modify the solubility.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2 in methanol solution and in their film states are shown in Fig. 1. The PTPA-EP solution showed an absorption maximum (λabs) at 375 nm (Table 1). The λabs for its thin film slightly red-shifted to 380 nm. The absorption edges of the solution and the film of PTPA-EP were at 430 and 445 nm, respectively. The polymer chain aggregates of PTPA-EP in film state slightly enhanced the conjugation length of the triphenylamine backbone. The film absorption behaviour of PTPA-EP is very similar to that of a PTPA copolymer with sodium sulfonate on the side chains in a previous report. Approximately, the absorption behaviour of PTPA is determined by the polymer backbone, despite the side chain differences.

The λabs for the “solution” and the film of PTPA-PO3Na2 were at 375 and 385 nm, respectively, comparable with those of PTPA-EP. The absorbance at longer wavelengths of the PTPA-PO3Na2 “solution” probably due to light scattering, also confirmed that its polymer chains in methanol would exist in aggregate form. The light-scattering induced film absorbance at longer wavelengths (440–600 nm) of PTPA-PO3Na2 indicated that the film was of poor quality.
The PL spectra of PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2 in methanol solutions and in their film states, under 350 nm excitation, are also shown in Fig. 1. The solution and film of PTPA-EP showed emission maxima (λem) at 428 and 442 nm, respectively (Table 1). The red-shifted λem of the film is a contribution from chain aggregation. The λem values of PTPA-PO3Na2 “solution” and film were at 441 and 446 nm, respectively. The small red-shift of λem of the film relative to its “solution” also suggests that PTPA-PO3Na2 could not form a true solution.

The optical band gap (Eg), estimated with the absorption edge of the thin solid film, is also listed in Table 1. The Eg of PTPA-EP was 2.79 eV. But the Eg for PTPA-PO3Na2 could not be accurately obtained due to strong light-scattering of its film. The HOMO levels of the polymers were obtained from the onsets of oxidation potential (Eox) during cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 2) with a saturated calomel reference electrode and an energy level of ferrocene of −4.80 eV as the internal standard. The HOMO levels of PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2 were −5.01 and −5.05 eV, according to their Eox values of 0.21 and 0.25 V, respectively. The HOMO levels of the polymers are quite close to most triphenylamine molecules. Thus the oxidation processes of the polymers exhibited negligible influences of their pendant groups, which were determined by their backbones. The LUMO level was calculated from the HOMO level and resulting Eg. The deduced LUMO level of PTPA-EP was −2.22 eV while no LUMO for PTPA-PO3Na2 could be obtained due to no reliable Eg.


Compared with using hydrophilic conjugated polymers as the cathode interlayer in conventional solar cells, introducing a hydrophilic conjugated polymer as the cathode interlayer in inverted solar cells receives much less attention. For the fabrication of inverted solar cells, an ideal organic interlayer needs a good adhesion capability to both ITO and the subsequently deposited active layer. Also the erosion of the organic interlayer by the solvent for deposition of the active layer should be greatly suppressed. An ideal organic interlayer should realize ohmic contact between the ITO cathode and the active layer.

Inverted solar cells with a device configuration of ITO/PTPA-EP (10 nm)/PCDTBT:PC71BM = 1:4 (65 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated (Fig. 3a). The PTPA-EP interlayer on ITO was deposited by spin-coating from its DMF solution. Then the interlayer was dried at 120 °C for 10 min. Spin-coating chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene on a PTPA-EP interlayer with a quartz substrate showed no decrease of the absorbance of PTPA-EP. The spin-coating of a mixed solvent based on dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene with a ratio of 3:1 (the solvent for the active layer) on the PTPA-EP interlayer indicated that the interlayer could retain 93% of its initial absorbance. Thus the thin film of PTPA-EP on ITO is fairly robust to endure solvent erosion during further spin-coating of the active layer. It should be noted that chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene are common solvents for deposition of various active layers of solar cells.

MoO3 possesses HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.6 and −2.6 eV, respectively, which had shown good hole extraction abilities in combination with Al, Ag, and Au as the top anode in inverted solar cells. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PCDTBT are −5.5 and −3.6 eV, respectively. Thus the HOMO level of PCDTBT is well aligned to the HOMO level of MoO3, which can benefit the hole extraction process. It should be noted that the LUMO level of PTPA-EP may not block the electron extraction from the PC71BM phase. For example, a hydrophilic polyfluorene copolymer as cathode interlayer in conventional solar cells could display very efficient extractions for electrons, from which higher Jsc and FF were achieved. This had been attributed to the modified interface contact between the active layer and the metal cathode by the hydrophilic interlayer polymer. The work function of ITO could be shifted by a thin interlayer of PTPA-EP. As measured by a Kelvin probe, the work function of ITO was shifted from the initial value of −4.7 eV to −4.3 eV by PTPA-EP (Fig. 3b). The decreased work function of ITO caused by the interlayer polymer matches well with the LUMO level of PC71BM and supplies good capability for electron extraction.
An inverted solar cell without the PTPA-EP interlayer on ITO was also fabricated for a comparison study to find the potential of the PTPA-EP interlayer in the photovoltaic device modifications. The measurements of the photovoltaic performances of the inverted solar cells were carried out under illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light at 80 mW cm−2.

Fig. 4 shows J–V characteristics of the solar cells. Their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. For the inverted solar cell without the PTPA-EP interlayer on ITO, the device showed Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.55 V, 7.77 mA cm−2, and 48%, respectively. The PCE of the solar cell was 2.57%. Inserting PTPA-EP as the cathode interlayer could largely improve the photovoltaic performance, and the inverted solar cell displayed Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.86 V, 7.96 mA cm−2, and 54.2%, respectively. The calculated PCE for the device was 4.59%, showing an increase of 79% in comparison with that of the bare ITO cathode. The PCE value is good among inverted solar cells with an organic interlayer on an ITO cathode. The Voc of 0.86 V is very close to 0.88 V of the same active layer in conventional solar cells. In general, the inverted solar cell with PTPA-EP as the interlayer on the ITO substrate can not only recover the existing Voc loss of the bare ITO cathode but also enhance the electron extraction. This should be attributed to the decreased work functions of ITO by PTPA-EP, which may supply efficient electron collection and decrease electron–hole recombination. In order to find out whether DMF, the solvent for PTPA-EP, plays some role in the improvement of device efficiency upon spin-coating from PTPA-EP DMF solution, a control device was fabricated in the same batch by spin-coating of DMF (without PTPA-EP) at the same spin speed and duration (2000 rpm for 20 s) and drying under the same conditions for PTPA-EP (120 °C for 10 min). The DMF pre-treated device also showed low Voc and FF, giving a PCE of 2.62%. Compared with the PCE increase of 79% by PTPA-EP, the limited change of PCE by the DMF treatment indicates that the interlayer polymer plays a crucial role in the large interfacial modification of the ITO cathode.

ZnO is a well-known inorganic interlayer on ITO cathode for inverted solar cells. Here a ZnO-based inverted solar cell was also fabricated for comparison to the PTPA-EP interlayer polymer. The ZnO interlayer on ITO was prepared with a thickness of 30 nm, according to a report by Yang et al. The solar cell showed a comparable Voc of 0.87 V. But Jsc of 8.04 mA cm−2 and FF of 59.3% of the ZnO-based solar cell were slightly higher than those of the solar cell with PTPA-EP as the interlayer. The calculated PCE of the ZnO-based solar cell was 5.13%.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the inverted solar cells are shown in Fig. 5. The solar cells with bare ITO and ITO/PTPA-EP showed similar photosensitivity style, despite the slightly higher EQE of PTPA-EP in the wavelength range between 380 and 600 nm. The maximum EQE values for the solar cells with bare ITO and ITO/PTPA-EP are 62 and 65%, respectively. ZnO-based solar cells could show enhanced photosensitivity in the wavelength range between 395 and 475 nm. Its maximum EQE of 67% existed at 420 nm.
We followed our previously reported procedures to fabricate a conventional solar cell with PTPA-EP as the interlayer in combination with an Al cathode, with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/PCDTBT:PC71BM = 1:4 (65 nm)/PTPA-EP (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The solar cell displayed Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.90 V, 8.18 mA cm−2, and 57.3%, respectively. The calculated PCE for the device was 5.27%, which was higher than that of a ZnO-based inverted solar cell. The results suggest that PTPA-EP is a promising new cathode interlayer for both inverted and conventional solar cells.
For the contact of PTPA-EP to the Al cathode in the conventional solar cell, measurement by Kelvin probe indicated that the work function of Al was moved from an initial value of −4.3 eV to −3.9 eV by PTPA-EP. This could be attributed to dipole formation at the interface between PTPA-EP and Al. The decreased work function of Al by PTPA-EP could enhance the built-in potential across the device, which was beneficial for charge separation and transport.
The relative stability of the solar cells was evaluated. In order to exclude the influence of deterioration of the Al electrode of the inverted and conventional solar cells on the device stability, all the solar cells were kept in a nitrogen dry-box. After storage for 40 days, the inverted solar cells with ITO/PTPA-EP and ITO/ZnO cathodes showed comparable stability. The PCEs of the inverted solar cells retained 96.3% and 96.7% of the initial values for ITO/PTPA-EP and ITO/ZnO, respectively. During the same period, the PCE of the conventional solar cell only retained 83% of its initial value.


Homopolymers PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2, comprising diethyl phosphonate and sodium phosphonate end groups on side chains, respectively, were synthesized. The absorption and PL properties of the two polymers are mainly determined by the poly(triphenylamine) main chain. The PTPA-EP and PTPA-PO3Na2 possess comparable HOMO levels of around −5.03 eV. The PTPA-EP, with better solubility than PTPA-PO3Na2 in hydrophilic solvents, was utilized as a cathode interlayer to construct efficient solar cells. The work function of ITO could be shifted to −4.3 eV by PTPA-EP, which matches well the LUMO level of PC71BM for good electron extraction. Inverted solar cells with PTPA-EP on an ITO cathode exhibited a PCE of 4.59%, which is a good efficiency among inverted solar cells with an organic interlayer on an ITO cathode. The PCE shows a 79% increase in comparison to that of a bare ITO cathode, though the efficiency is lower than the value of 5.13% for an inverted solar cell with a ZnO interlayer on ITO. Furthermore, a conventional solar cell with PTPA-EP/Al as the cathode could show a better PCE of 5.27%. The results indicate that PTPA-EP is a promising new cathode interlayer for high efficiency inverted and conventional solar cells.
