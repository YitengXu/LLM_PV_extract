A cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystal was used as an electron transport/extraction layer for perovskite solar cells due to its high electron mobility and solution-processability at low temperatures. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.7% was achieved under standard AM1.5G conditions in air.

Since T. Miyasaka and co-workers reported the first perovskite-sensitized solar cell in 2009, perovskite has become one of the hottest solar cell materials. Over the last few years, we have witnessed an unexpected breakthrough and rapid evolution in the field of emerging photovoltaics, with the realization of highly efficient solid-state hybrid solar cells based on organometal trihalide perovskite absorbers. It is likely that the solar research in the coming years will advance this technology to the highest efficiencies while retaining the lowest cost and embodied energy.

At present, most of the highly efficient perovskite-based devices utilize a mesoporous metal-oxide scaffold on which the perovskite crystal grows, while acting as an electron-transport/extraction layer at the same time. However, mesoporous films such as TiO2 always require sintering at high temperatures (450–550 °C) prior to use, rendering them incompatible with flexible substrates and easy fabrication. Since the pronounced work by Snaith et al., who demonstrated that a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 15%, many highly efficient planar heterojunction perovskite-based devices have been demonstrated. Subsequently, motivated by the desire to further simplify the processing method, low-temperature solution processed planar heterojunction solar cells were achieved by several groups. Kelly et al. reported a PCE of 15.7% by using a layer of ZnO nanoparticles as an electron-transport layer in CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells, where the CH3NH3PbI3 layer was grown by a two-step process. Another promising type of low temperature solution processed perovskite solar cell with an ‘inverted’ device structure of Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT-PSS)/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/Al has also achieved a high PCE up to 15.4%.
The CdSe nanocrystal has been one of the most successful n-type materials for polymer/nanocrystal hybrid solar cells due to its high electron mobility, mature synthesis and tunable band gap. Here we investigated the use of CdSe nanoparticles replacing the widely used TiO2 as the electron transport/extraction layer for conventional planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Compared to TiO2 (4–20 cm2 V−1 s−1), the much higher electron mobility of CdSe (450–900 cm2 V−1 s−1) makes it an ideal choice for an electron-selective contact. In addition, the CdSe nanocrystal films can be solution processed and only low temperature annealing (<150 °C) is needed, which renders it possible for deposition on flexible substrates. Devices with CdSe nanoparticles acting as an electron transport/extraction layer performed well, with the highest PCE reaching 11.7% when illuminated and tested under standard AM1.5G conditions in air.
The CdSe nanoparticles were prepared by a hot-injection method followed by the ligand exchange with pyridine reported previously. The pyridine exchange process was demonstrated to replace the long chain surfactant on the surface of CdSe (Fig. S1) and thus can enhance the electron mobility of the CdSe film. The as-prepared CdSe nanoparticles are approximately 6 nm in diameter, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S2). The CdSe nanoparticles are dispersed in a chlorobenzene–pyridine mixed solvent. After being spin coated onto the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, a relatively compact layer was formed (Fig. 1c, also Fig. 1b). The work function of the CdSe nanocrystal film is about 4.6 eV, which was determined by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and is shown in Fig. 1d. The suitable energy level is favorable for electron extraction. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber film was formed on the top of the CdSe layer by spin coating a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of CH3NH3I and PbI2 and then annealed at 90 °C for 30 min. Spin-coating of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) acting as the hole-transport layer and thermal evaporation of the Ag top electrode completes the device fabrication (Fig. 1a and b). The corresponding energy level alignment is shown in Fig. 1e. Free charges generated in CH3NH3PbI3 are supposed to be extracted by transferring electrons to the underlying CdSe layer and holes to the spiro-OMeTAD.
To optimize the performance of perovskite solar cells, devices were prepared by spin coating one, two, or three layers of CdSe nanoparticles and annealed at different temperatures (Fig. 2a and b and Table 1). As can be seen from Table 1, incorporating a layer of a 50 nm CdSe nanocrystal and annealing at 140 °C lead to the best performance, with an average PCE nearly 11%. Thermal annealing can efficiently reduce the traps and enhance the electron mobility of CdSe films, which contributes to the improvement of devices when increasing the annealing temperature from 100 to 140 °C. However, further increasing the temperature cannot result in any improvement in device performance. Effects of the CdSe nanocrystal thickness were also investigated. As we can see, incorporating a thin layer of CdSe (25 nm) into the device significantly improves the performance. When the thickness of the CdSe layer is 50 nm, PCEs in excess of 11% were obtained. Further increasing the thickness was harmful to the devices. A thick CdSe film absorbs much incident light but contributes little to the current, and it may also introduce a large series resistance, thus reducing Jsc and FF.

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the best device is shown in Fig. 2c and d. From the J–V curve measured under standard AM1.5G illumination, the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE were determined to be 17.4 mA cm−2, 0.99 V, 67.9% and 11.7%, respectively. A histogram of efficiencies measured from 50 devices shows an average PCE of 10.7%, which is much higher than that (9.0%) of the devices with TiO2 as an electron transport/extraction layer. The improvement mainly by FF can be attributed to the excellent electron transport/extraction ability of CdSe. These encouraging results demonstrate that CdSe is an efficient electron transport/extraction material to obtain a reproducible high-performance perovskite solar cell. In Fig. 2d, the EQE spectrum is shown for the best device, exhibiting spectral sensitivity spanning from the visible to the near-IR region (400 to 800 nm) with a peak IPCE of >70%. However, there is an obvious EQE loss below 550 nm as we can see from the EQE spectrum due to the low transmittance of CdSe below 650 nm compared to anatase TiO2. The low EQE values in this range result in low current for CdSe based devices. The hysteresis issue when changing the electron transport layer from TiO2 to CdSe was studied, and the preliminary results showed no obvious difference for the two electron transport layers. They both showed obvious hysteresis (Fig. S3).
The origin of the high performance observed in the perovskite solar cells with CdSe nanocrystals as the electron transport/extraction material was investigated further by studying the electron mobility of CdSe and TiO2 films, the morphology of perovskite and the electron transfer process between perovskite and the CdSe nanocrystal. First, the electron mobilities of CdSe nanoparticles and TiO2 were studied by a space charged limited current (SCLC) method using electron-only devices: ITO/CdSe/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)](PFN)/Al or FTO/TiO2/PFN/Al. The electron mobility of 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.1 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been determined for the devices with the CdSe nanoparticle or the TiO2 film, respectively (Fig. S4). Obviously, the electron mobility in the CdSe nanoparticle film is much higher than that in the TiO2 film, which indicates that the electrons can be effectively transported into the CdSe nanoparticle films. Then, we studied the surface coverage of the crystallized perovskite that was previously proved to significantly affect the device performance. To investigate the surface morphology of the perovskite film on different substrates, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted. The images are shown in Fig. 3. CdSe and TiO2 obviously improve the formation and growth of the perovskite film, leading to homogeneous and nearly full surface coverage, compared to bare ITO. However, there are still some voids observed in the films, which need to be further tuned to achieve higher performance.
CdSe nanocrystals and spiro-OMeTAD are supposed to act as the electron transport layer and the hole transport layer, respectively. We measured the charge generation of the perovskite solar cells using photoluminescence (PL) characterization. The PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3, CdSe/CH3NH3PbI3, and CdSe/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD films on glass substrates were measured. The excitation light of 600 nm entered the sample from the glass substrate side, and the PL emission was collected. As shown in Fig. 4, when CH3NH3PbI3 was deposited onto the inert glass substrate, strong PL emission was observed centered at around 780 nm. In contrast, we observed a significant PL quenching effect when the perovskite layer established contact with the CdSe nanocrystals. After spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated on the CdSe/CH3NH3PbI3 layer, the PL was completely quenched. These results indicate that electrons/holes can be efficiently extracted by CdSe and spiro-OMeTAD respectively, which is a prerequisite for highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated the ITO/CdSe/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag planar heterojunction solar cell with CdSe nanocrystals as the electron transport/extraction layer. A high power conversion efficiency of 11.7% was achieved through low temperature solution processing. The results indicate that the CdSe nanocrystal is an efficient electron transport/extraction material, which provides varieties for perovskite-based solar cell design.
