By mixing perovskite MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+) with LiCl, an effective one-step drop-coating approach was developed to improve the performance of hole-conductor-free printable perovskite solar cells. The LiCl-mixed perovskite exhibited superior electronic properties because of the improved conductivity of the perovskite layer enabling faster electron transport. LiCl-mixing also improved the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer. As a consequence, perovskite solar cells prepared using the LiCl-mixed perovskite as the light harvester produced higher performances compared with the unmixed perovskite, improving the power conversion efficiency from 10.0% to 14.5%.

Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention due to the dramatic increase in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the last few years. To date, a certified efficiency of 22.1% has been obtained. In particular, MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) have emerged as the most extensively used light harvesting materials because of their small exciton binding energy, high absorption coefficient, and high charge carrier mobility. With the demand for a low-cost and scale-up process, hole-conductor-free fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (MPSCs) using a carbon counter electrode were developed by our group and a certified PCE of 12.8% was achieved with good stability when MAPbI3 was mixed with 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI). However, this kind of hole-conductor-free MPSC suffers from a problem of charge transport due to the micrometer-thick ZrO2 layer (∼2 μm) between the TiO2 layer and carbon layer. As a result, the MPSCs typically encounter a low open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). In order to achieve high-performance devices, additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), MACl, NH4Cl and KCl have been introduced into the pristine precursor solution in the conventional structure perovskite solar cells. The role of these additives is mainly to improve the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer, leading to efficient charge transfer within the device. In the meantime, Kim et al. found that the bulk conductivity of the polymers can be significantly increased by p-doping and Bradley et al. reported that the improvement of the conductivity depended on the doping ratio. Such merits of additives prompted us to investigate the influence of mixed MAPbI3 on its electronic properties and on the photovoltaic behaviour when employed in hole-conductor-free printable MPSCs.

In this report, by incorporating LiCl into the pristine perovskite precursor solution, we developed a simple and effective method to fabricate high performance perovskite solar cells. It was found that the additive not only reduced the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the perovskite and carbon counter electrode, but also improved the conductivity of the perovskite. Moreover, the additive helped to improve the morphology of the perovskite film, as well as the optical and electrical properties, as evidenced from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis absorption spectra, Hall-effect measurements, time-resolved fluorescence (PL) decay spectra, and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared with the control device, the photovoltaic performance of the LiCl-mixed device was dramatically improved from 10% up to 14.5%. A champion device, with a PCE of 14.5% with a VOC of 927 mV, a JSC of 20.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.77, was achieved by utilizing a perovskite precursor solution containing 30% LiCl.

Lead iodide (PbI2) and anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized according to the literature. To prepare the pristine perovskite precursor solution, MAI and PbI2 powder were mixed in anhydrous DMF with a molar ratio of 1:1. The LiCl-mixed perovskite solution was prepared via adding different molar ratios of LiCl and perovskite into the precursor solutions. The solutions were stirred overnight at 50 °C before device fabrication.


The FTO conducting glass was etched with a laser to form desired electrode patterns before being ultrasonically cleaned with detergent solution, deionized water and ethanol for 15 min, respectively. A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO-coated glass by spray pyrolysis deposition at 450 °C with a 2-propanol solution containing di-isopropoxytitanium bis(acetylacetonate). And then a 500 nm mesoporous TiO2 layer, a 2 μm ZrO2 spacer layer, and a 10 μm carbon layer were subsequently screen-printed on the glass. The TiO2 layer and ZrO2 layer were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, and the carbon layer was sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the films were infiltrated with perovskite solution via drop coating and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. All the above procedures were completed in air atmosphere.


Photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley Model 2400 digital source meter and an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) giving an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. A black mask with a circular aperture (0.10 cm2), smaller than the size of the device active area (0.50 cm2), was applied on top of the cell. The scan rate was 0.25 V s−1 and the scan directions were both forward (short-circuit to open-circuit) and backward (open-circuit to short-circuit). The distributions of photovoltaic parameters of 15 devices are presented in Fig. 5 and S2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source.


The XRD spectra were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The UV-visible spectra of the perovskite films on the TiO2/FTO-coated glass were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a field emission SEM (FEI Nova Nano SEM 450).

The steady-state photoluminescence was measured on a LabRAM HR800 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The samples used for the steady-state were prepared by spin coating on the glass.
Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay transients were measured at 780 nm using excitation with a 478 nm light pulse from a HORIBA Scientific DeltaPro fluorimeter. The samples used for time-resolved PL measurements were prepared by infiltrating the perovskite into the ZrO2 films. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on a ZAHNER Zennium Electrochemical Workstation in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 4 MHz under dark conditions. Hall-effect measurements were performed at room temperature on a 4-probe sample holder placed between the plates of an electromagnet, where a magnetic field of 0.55 T and a current of 5–50 nA were applied.

The perovskite solar cell was constructed with the configuration of FTO/(TiO2/ZrO2/carbon)/perovskite. The thicknesses of the mesoporous TiO2, ZrO2 and carbon layers were about 0.5, 2 and 10 μm, respectively. To explore the extent of pore filling within the device, we performed SEM on the device using the LiCl-mixed perovskite as the light harvester. The result is shown in Fig. 1a with the elemental mapping on the rectangular area shown in Fig. 1b. The EDS elemental mapping confirms the presence of LiCl in the final film. To investigate whether the chloride ions are just trapped within the mesoporous film (the film thickness is over 12 microns) or not, we performed another EDS measurement using a pure perovskite/LiCl film in Fig. S1. The result also reveals that the chloride was present in the film. In addition, we investigated the XPS (Table S2) ultimate analysis of Cl, Pb and I. The quantitative analysis results show that the atomic concentration ratio of Pb/I and Pb/Cl is about 1:3 and 1:0.06, respectively. There is about 1/5 chloride within the final perovskite film. It should be noted that the device used for cross-sectional imaging only includes FTO/TiO2/ZrO2 films filled with the perovskite. It could be observed that most of the mesopores of the TiO2/ZrO2 double layer were fully infiltrated with the perovskite crystal. In addition, we recorded SEM images of the top views of the perovskite films deposited by the spin coating process on the mesoporous TiO2 films in Fig. 2. Images a–d correspond to the perovskite films mixed with 0%, 15%, 30% and 50% LiCl, respectively. For the control perovskite film, some large crystal plates (more than 40 μm) were observed as shown in Fig. 2a. For the 15% LiCl-based films, the large crystal plates partially disappeared and some small crystals started to form, as shown in Fig. 2b. When 30% LiCl was mixed, the large crystal plates totally disappeared and the substrate was coated with small islands. Finally, when 50% LiCl was mixed, the islands were replaced by the uniform and small crystals, leading to enhanced surface coverage of the perovskite. Although the perovskite shows a slightly different appearance on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 films, the perovskite incorporated into the triple mesoporous films of the device displays a similar appearance. The significant effect on the morphology of the perovskite films may be attributed to the interactions between Pb2+ and Cl− during the drying and annealing of the perovskite film, which correspondingly slow down the perovskite formation process.

To investigate the structural characteristics of the different components, we spin-coated the precursor solutions containing different concentrations of LiCl on FTO substrates and carried out a series of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The results are shown in Fig. 3a. The XRD spectra of all perovskite films exhibited identical characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 14.03°, 28.30°, 31.78°, 40.55°, and 43.08°, representing the (110), (220), (310), (224), and (314) crystal planes, respectively. In addition, no peak was observed at ∼15.57° which represented CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. This suggests that the CH3NH3PbI3 with and without mixing LiCl possesses identical crystal lattices and the additive does not appear to be present in the perovskite crystal after annealing. On the other hand, the intensity of the (110) peak and (220) peak increased as a function of the LiCl concentration, indicating a stronger preferred orientation on these facets.
UV-vis absorption measurements were performed for the perovskite films prepared from the different perovskite precursor solutions on mesoporous TiO2, as shown in Fig. 3b. With increasing concentration of LiCl, the perovskite films processed with LiCl-mixed solutions exhibited enhanced light absorption, reaching their maximum value with 30% concentration. A plausible explanation for these results is the improved crystal quality in the device. The concentration of LiCl that was higher than 30% resulted in a sharp decrease of absorbance.
The photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite films was also investigated. Fig. 3c shows the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films without and with LiCl on the glass. Both films displayed a PL emission peak at ∼780 nm, but the intensity of the perovskite film mixed with LiCl is higher than that of the control, indicating fewer defects within the 30% LiCl-mixed film. The time-resolved PL decay of both films on the mesoscopic ZrO2 is presented in Fig. 3d. The PL lifetime of the films fitted well with a bi-exponential decay function, corresponding to a fast decay process from the quenching of free carriers in the perovskite material, and a slow decay process from the radiative decay, respectively. For the MAPbI3 film, the PL decay lifetime for the two decay processes is 12.9 ns and 2.3 ns, with the weight fractions 42% and 58%, respectively. But for the 30% LiCl-based film, the PL decay lifetime is 7.5 ns and 60.4 ns, with weight fractions of 58% and 42%, respectively. As a result, the average PL decay lifetime of the 30% LiCl-mixed film is determined to be 29.72 ns, more than four times longer than that of the control (6.75 ns), confirming again that mixing the perovskite precursor solution with LiCl led to fewer defects in the film. As stated above, we can make a conclusion that the LiCl rich environment in the perovskite precursor solution is beneficial to form a high quality film.
To show the effect of LiCl on the properties and performance of the perovskite solar cells, the photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and IPCE measurements were performed and are illustrated in Fig. 4. The J–V curves were scanned both forward (short-circuit to open-circuit) and backward (open-circuit to short-circuit) at a rate of 0.25 V s−1. The concentration of 30% was found to be the optimum molar concentration of LiCl in the mixed perovskite precursor solution. Fig. 4a shows the J–V characteristic of the champion device using mixed perovskite and the one without mixing is shown in Fig. 4b as a reference. The open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices are listed in Table 1. The champion solar cell prepared using the perovskite precursor solution containing 30% LiCl gave a VOC of 927 mV, a JSC of 20.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.77 to yield a PCE of 14.5%. By contrast, the control device fabricated with the pristine precursor exhibited a PCE of 10.0% with a VOC of 869 mV, a JSC of 17.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.65. The enhancement of JSC could be attributed to the increased IPCE in the range of 400–750 nm, as shown in Fig. 4c. The IPCE spectra were measured under no bias light. The JSC integrated from the IPCE spectra for the control and 30% LiCl-mixed devices is about 16.5 and 19 mA cm−2, respectively, which are comparable to the ones measured from the J–V curve and slightly lower (about 1 mA cm−2) than the stabilized current density output for the 30% device at 0.72 V bias (in Fig. 4d).

Fig. 5 shows the histograms of PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF of the control and 30% LiCl devices. The efficiencies of the control devices are mostly in the range of 9–10%, with the VOC and FF of devices being around 870 mV and 0.68, respectively. After mixing the perovskite precursor with LiCl, a significant improvement in all photovoltaic parameters was observed. As a result, the PCE of 30% LiCl devices is mainly distributed in the range of 13–14% with the VOC and FF of the devices being about 920–940 mV and 0.76–0.8, respectively. In addition, it was found that the FF of the devices increased with increasing the concentration of LiCl, as shown in Fig. S2. Particularly, an average FF of 0.77 and 0.80 was obtained by using the 30% and 50% LiCl-based perovskite precursor solution, respectively (Table S1). The histograms of all parameters of the devices fabricated from the four precursor solutions (the control, 15%, 30%, and 50%) are shown in Fig. S2.
To further examine the origin of the improved device characteristics, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized and the corresponding Nyquist plots at different negative bias voltages are displayed in Fig. 6 and S3. The plots were fitted according to the transmission line model with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S4. There are mainly two interfaces of TiO2/perovskite and perovskite/carbon electrodes, corresponding to two RC elements in the equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. S4.

Fig. 6a shows typical Nyquist plots at bias −0.60 V of the control and 30% LiCl-based devices in the dark. The parameters extracted from EIS images are shown in Fig. 6b–d. It is clearly seen that there are two well-defined semicircles in the range of 100 mHz to 4 MHz. According to the previous work, the first semicircle stands for charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the perovskite/carbon electrode interface and the second semicircle represents the recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Fig. 6b displays the series resistance (Rs) as a function of VOC. The Rs values of the 30% device are slightly larger than those of the control. Fig. 6c shows the charge transfer resistance (Rct) as a function of voltage. The Rct values of the 30% LiCl-mixed devices are generally 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those of the control devices. The dramatically reduced Rct leads to a significant increase of FF in the LiCl-mixed devices. The VOC can be affected by the charge recombination rate. Charge recombination resistance (Rrec) as a function of voltage is shown in Fig. 6d. In contrast to the control device, the 30% LiCl-mixed device shows a larger Rrec, suggesting a significant effect on alleviating the carrier recombination rate upon addition of LiCl in the MPSCs. As a result, the 30% LiCl-mixed device yielded a higher VOC.
Finally, Hall-effect measurements were performed at room temperature on a 4-probe sample holder placed between the plates of an electromagnet. The sample was measured under an excitation of 40 nA with a constant magnetic field of 0.55 T and the results are shown in Table 2. It has been reported that the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film has high resistivity and low carrier concentration, which is typically below the sensitivity of the Hall-effect measurement system. In our case, no signal was observed with the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film, which was in agreement with the previous observation. However, the LiCl-mixed perovskite gave negative signs, indicating the n-type nature of the carriers. Meanwhile, the bulk carrier concentration is in the order of 1015 cm−3 and the electron mobility is ∼63 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the carrier concentration of the pure CH3NH3PbI3 film is 1.5 × 109 cm−3 and the electron mobility is ∼66 cm2 V−1 s−1. In addition, the sample was measured under a variable excitation of 5–50 nA with a constant magnetic field of 0.55 T and the results are shown in Table S3. The addition of the LiCl sharply increased the bulk carrier concentration. In addition, the resistivity value of the 30% LiCl film is in the order of ∼101 Ω cm, which is 5 orders of magnitude lower than the previously reported value (6.6 MΩ cm) obtained for a polycrystalline sample, leading to a high conductivity for the perovskite film and contributes to a low charge transfer resistance of the device. The significantly enhanced conductivity is partly due to the improved morphology of the perovskite film. On the other hand, we speculate that this improvement may also be ascribed to the Li+ within the perovskite film.

In summary, we demonstrated a one-step mixing approach that allowed preparing a perovskite layer with superior electronic properties. Compared with the control device, the PCE of the 30% LiCl-mixed device significantly improved from 10% to 14.5% with a VOC of 927 mV, a JSC of 20.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.77. It was found that upon mixing, the conductivity of the perovskite was improved. The additive also has an effect on the degree of crystallinity and morphology, which was confirmed by EIS, PL, Hall-effect measurements and SEM. As a result, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the device that used the LiCl mixed perovskite instead of the unmixed one was reduced dramatically and thus gave a better performance. These results suggest that mixing CH3NH3PbI3 with additives such as LiCl is a promising method to fabricate high performance hole-conductor-free printable perovskite solar cells.
