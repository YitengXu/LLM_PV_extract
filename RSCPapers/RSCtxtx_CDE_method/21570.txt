Quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D) perovskites ((RNH3)2MAn−1PbnI3n+1, RNH3 represents the organic spacer (mostly phenethylammonium (PEA) and n-butylammonium (BA)) and MA = methylammonium) have shown great potential for application in solar cells due to their intrinsic stability, where the organic spacer dominantly determines the Q-2D perovskite ambient stability and device performance. Current studies merely concentrate on unary organic spacer Q-2D perovskites, either using BA or PEA. Herein, for the first time, we have successfully designed and fabricated (PEA1−xBAx)2MA3Pb4I13 binary spacer-based Q-2D perovskite films, and demonstrated that the device using binary organic spacer-based Q-2D perovskite films has substantially better performance than that using either of the unary organic spacer-based Q-2D perovskite films. The (PEA0.8BA0.2)2MA3Pb4I13 binary spacer device yields a maximum power conversion efficiency of 15.7%, which outperforms the efficiency record (12–14%) for unary spacer (PEA or BA) Q-2D perovskite devices. In particular, a peak open-circuit voltage of 1.21 V is achieved due to a non-radiative recombination loss of ∼100 mV, the lowest reported loss value for Q-2D perovskite devices. The high device performance results from binary-spacer-induced intensified film surface quality, preferable vertical orientation of crystals and improved film optoelectronic properties as well as obviously decreased device recombination losses. These findings open up a new avenue for the rational design of Q-2D perovskite materials with polynary organic spacer.

Solar cells based on three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have shown promise as next-generation solution-processed photovoltaic devices due to their low-cost fabrication and rapidly increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 23%. However, 3D perovskite solar cells commonly suffer from inherent instabilities with respect to humidity, illumination and heat, which significantly hinders the realization of commercial applications. In order to search for novel intrinsically stable perovskite materials, Ruddlesden–Popper layered quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D) perovskites with a general formula of (RNH3)2An−1MnX3n+1 are developed, where RNH3 represents the bulky organic spacer and the perovskite frame consists of a small cation (A), divalent metal (M) and halide anion (X). Compared with their 3D counterparts, Q-2D perovskites exhibit better ambient stability owing to the stronger interaction between the organic spacer and the perovskite frame and the more hydrophobic property of the organic spacer, but much lower PCEs are obtained in Q-2D perovskite devices because of the poor charge transport and large exciton binding energy. The intrinsic insulating organic spacer layer of Q-2D perovskites is considered to mainly block the vertical charge carrier transport, and thus significantly decreases the PCE of Q-2D perovskite devices. Promoting the vertical orientation of Q-2D perovskite films on substrates can effectively reduce the hindering effect of the organic spacer and achieve efficient charge transport, and therefore becomes an effective strategy to boost the PCE of Q-2D perovskite devices.

Currently, several approaches including the hot-casting method, the mixed-cation strategy, additive assistance and organic spacer design are reported to effectively improve the vertical alignment of Q-2D perovskite films (n ≤ 5) on substrates. Mohite and co-workers introduced a hot-casting technique to realize the preparation of vertically oriented BA2MA3Pb4I13 (BA+ = CH3CH2CH2CH2NH3+) films, giving a high PCE of 12.51%. On this basis, a higher PCE of 13.7% was achieved by designing a novel mixed-cation composition of BA2(MA0.95Cs0.05)3Pb4I13. Moreover, a combination of NH4SCN and NH4Cl additives was employed to fabricate vertically ordered PEA2MA4Pb5I16 (PEA+ = C6H5CH2CH2NH3+) films, delivering an average PCE of 12.9%. Despite these significant advances toward highly efficient Q-2D perovskite devices, current studies merely focus on the optimization of unary organic spacer (mostly either BA or PEA) Q-2D perovskite materials. So far, there is still no report about the vertically oriented growth of binary organic spacer Q-2D perovskites. Inspired by the compositional engineering of three-dimensional perovskites, binary organic spacer Q-2D perovskites are promising to achieve more efficient charge transport and better device performance compared with their unary spacer counterparts. However, the realization of the vertical orientation of binary spacer Q-2D perovskites still remains challenging since each type of unary spacer Q-2D perovskite has obviously different fabrication conditions. Therefore, developing binary spacer Q-2D perovskites requires enormous work to explore the effects of a binary spacer on the crystal orientation, charge transport and device performance, which eventually promotes the development of Q-2D perovskite optoelectronics.
Compared to their 3D counterparts, Q-2D perovskite devices usually suffer from a much lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) due to the existence of an insulating organic spacer, and thus the corresponding PCE is severely limited. At present, this limiting factor can be greatly overcome by the realization of the vertical orientation of perovskite crystals, which is well supported by a high Jsc of ∼20 mA cm−2 in BA2MA3Pb4I13 solar cells. Naturally, a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of Q-2D perovskite devices will play a dominant role in further improvements of device efficiency. So far, most of the reported Voc values of Q-2D perovskite (n = 4 and 5 with a bandgap of ∼1.60 eV) devices are much smaller than 1.20 V. Therefore, a higher Voc close to 1.2 V is urgently required in Q-2D perovskite devices in order to further boost the PCE.
In this work, we have prepared vertically oriented (PEA1−xBAx)2MA3Pb4I13 (x ≤ 0.3) binary spacer Q-2D perovskite films for the first time, and the effects of binary spacer PEA–BA on the film phase, film morphology and crystal orientation as well as optical properties are investigated in detail. Furthermore, we systematically compare the optoelectronic properties of unary (PEA) and binary (PEA–BA) spacer perovskite films, such as charge transfer dynamics, trap density and hole mobility. We have found that the introduction of a binary spacer causes improved film surface quality, preferable vertical orientation of crystals and enhanced optoelectronic properties. Accordingly, the (PEA0.8BA0.2)2MA3Pb4I13 binary spacer device yields a peak PCE of 15.7%, and more importantly, a maximum Voc of 1.21 V is also achieved due to an extremely small non-radiative recombination loss of ∼100 mV.

For the sake of simplicity, we utilize BA0, BA0.1, BA0.2, BA0.3 and BA1 to represent the chemical formula (PEA1−xBAx)2MA3Pb4I13 with x = 0, x = 0.1, x = 0.2, x = 0.3 and x = 1, respectively. The crystal phase of (PEA1−xBAx)2MA3Pb4I13 binary spacer perovskite films is investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S1). Obviously, two dominant diffraction peaks are located at the 2θ of 14.21° and 28.52° for the BA0 unary spacer film, corresponding to the (111) and (202) lattice planes. No additional diffraction peaks appear when the BA organic spacer is incorporated into PEA2MA3Pb4I13 structure. With the increase of the BA spacer concentration from 0% to 30%, the main diffraction peak (111) experiences a slight shift from 14.21° to 14.35° in the magnified XRD region (Fig. S1b). This gradual shift in the main peak could be ascribed to the smaller spacer size of BA than that of PEA. In order to further verify the BA spacer concentration in the final films, perovskite films deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates are dissolved in the solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) and the resulting solution is examined via proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). It is found that the experimentally measured BA spacer concentrations are quite close to BA ratios in the starting materials (Fig. S3).

Then, the effects of BA contents on the morphology of (PEA1−xBAx)2MA3Pb4I13 binary spacer films are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 1, uniform morphologies along with full coverage are observed for all perovskite films. Without a BA spacer, the BA0 unary spacer film exhibits a comparably bumpy surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 26.9 nm as well as a considerably vertical orientation tendency of perovskite crystals. Interestingly, the introduction of 10% BA spacer enables small dents on the film surface to become much smaller and greatly promotes the formation of a smooth film, yielding a significantly decreased RMS roughness of 11.2 nm. When substituting PEA with 20% BA spacer, further fusion and disappearance of small dents on the film surface generate a very smooth film with a minimum RMS roughness of 8.07 nm. However, a further increase to 30% BA spacer causes a deteriorated surface with evident cracks and convexities, corresponding to an increased RMS roughness of 14.0 nm. It is clear that the binary spacer perovskite film with 20% BA displays the best surface quality among all samples. In addition, the comparison of cross-sectional SEM images suggests that the vertical orientation of perovskite crystals is notably strengthened with the addition of a BA organic spacer, which is favourable for charge transport along the vertical direction.
In order to further probe the crystal orientation of unary (PEA) and binary (PEA–BA) spacer Q-2D perovskite films, two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (2D-XRD) measurements are implemented. The BA0 unary spacer film exhibits two sharp and discrete Bragg spots corresponding to the lattice planes of (111) and (202) rather than diffraction rings (Fig. 2a), indicating the formation of highly oriented crystal grains. Strikingly, this oriented alignment of crystal domains is further strengthened in the BA0.2 binary spacer film, where the two Bragg spots are more focused (Fig. 2b), consistent with the enhanced vertical alignment of crystals as observed in the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1a). Moreover, we employ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements to further verify the enhanced vertical orientation of Q-2D perovskite films with BA spacer addition. Both the films without and with a BA spacer show discrete Bragg spots (Fig. S4), indicative of the highly oriented crystal grains. However, the Bragg spots become more focused in the BA0.2 binary spacer film compared to the BA0 unary spacer film, indicating that the addition of a BA spacer can further strengthen the vertical alignment of crystals. Such a vertical orientation enables the perovskite inorganic layers to be perpendicular to the substrate (Fig. 2c) and therefore ensures the formation of efficient charge transport pathways in Q-2D perovskite films.
Absorbance and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements are performed to examine the absorption and emission properties of Q-2D perovskite films. Apparently, except the absorption onset (∼800 nm), additional absorbance peaks at around 524, 570, 612 and 642 nm exist in all samples, which can be ascribed to the excitonic absorption of Q-2D perovskite phases with n = 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (Fig. 3a). This result indicates that Q-2D perovskite films (nominally prepared with“n = 4”) consist of multiple perovskite phases with different n values, which is highly consistent with previous reports. In order to further confirm the mixed phases of our samples, we compare the PL signal of the BA0.2 film excited from both the front side (perovskite film) and back side (glass substrate). Both excitations exhibit a dominant emission peak at 774 nm, which is ascribed to the emission from the large-n (close to ∞) phases (Fig. S8a); however additional weak multiple peaks at higher energy (attributed to small-n phases) appear when excited from the back side (Fig. S8b). Such a difference in PL spectra between front and back excitations suggests that the large-n (close to ∞) phases locate at the upper surface of the film whereas the small-n phases are situated at the bottom of the film near the substrate, which is also reported in previous studies. This analysis further supports the notion that Q-2D perovskite films are a mixture of multiple phases with different n values. The absorbance onset of these films is located at ∼800 nm and undergoes a blue shift at a higher BA spacer concentration (Fig. S9a). Similarly, the BA0 unary spacer film shows a PL peak at 779 nm, and the PL peak gradually shifts to 773 nm when the BA spacer content is increased to 30% (Fig. 3b). This blue shift can be possibly attributed to a slightly larger bandgap of the BA2MA3Pb4I13 film than that of its PEA counterpart (Fig. S9b). In the steady-state PL spectra, the BA0 unary spacer film presents the strongest PL signal among all samples and the introduction of a BA spacer significantly lowers PL intensities, indicating a BA-doping-induced more efficient charge transfer process from Q-2D perovskites to poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA). In order to further quantitatively compare the charge transfer dynamics, the time-resolved PL spectra of these films are recorded and fitted to a bi-exponential function in Fig. 3c, and the corresponding fitting parameters are summarized in Table S1. A fast decay lifetime (τ1 = 7.29 ns) and a slow one (τ2 = 432 ns) are obtained in the case of the BA0 unary spacer film, yielding an average lifetime (τave) of 283 ns. As expected, the incorporation of a BA spacer from 0% to 30% leads to a continuous decrease of τave from 283 to 50.4 ns, further underpinning the notion that the addition of a BA spacer facilitates the transfer of photo-induce carriers from Q-2D perovskites into PTAA. Such a faster charge-transfer process is helpful for suppression of charge recombination at the perovskite/PTAA interface.
According to the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model, the trap density and hole mobility of (PEA1−xBAx)2MA3Pb4I13 binary spacer films with the structure of ITO/PTAA/Q-2D perovskite/Au are calculated (details in the ESI) from the dark current–voltage characteristics in Fig. S10, where we observe an ohmic response (red line) and a SCLC response (green line) as well as a trap-filled limited region in between. With the addition of the BA spacer, the trap density undergoes a slight decrease from 3.25 × 1015 to 2.90 × 1015 cm−3 with the lowest value at x = 0.2 (Fig. 3d), which is comparable to the excellent reported values of 1.31 to 2.78 × 1015 cm−3 in unary BA counterparts. Furthermore, the incorporation of a BA spacer enables the hole mobility to increase to a peak value of 4.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0.2 from 3.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at x = 0. Evidently, the binary spacer film with 20% BA displays the lowest trap density and highest hole mobility among all samples, which is ascribed to the superior surface morphology and preferable vertical orientation of crystals.
The photovoltaic performance of these binary spacer Q-2D perovskite films is investigated in the following architecture ITO/PTAA/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag (Fig. S11), and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the most representative devices (close to average results) measured under AM 1.5 illumination conditions are depicted in Fig. 4a. Photovoltaic parameters and the corresponding statistical distributions are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S12, respectively. BA0 based unary spacer devices exhibit a Jsc of 13.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.13 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 60.5%, yielding a PCE of 9.37%. Obviously, the introduction of a BA spacer significantly improves the device performance parameters, and a peak PCE of 15.1% along with a Jsc of 18.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.19 V and an FF of 68.8% is achieved in BA0.2 based binary spacer cells. Further increasing the BA spacer concentration to 30% results in reduced performance parameters (Jsc = 15.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.14 V, FF = 62.1% and PCE = 10.8%), which still outperform those of BA0 based unary spacer cells. The significant enhancement in BA-containing binary spacer device performance parameters can be attributed to the superior film surface quality and preferable vertical orientation of crystals as well as improved optoelectronic properties with regard to charge transfer dynamics, trap density and hole mobility.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves and integrated Jsc of solar cells with different active layers are illustrated in Fig. 4b. The integrated Jsc is determined to be 13.4, 15.4, 18.3 and 15.1 mA cm−2 for BA0, BA0.1, BA0.2 and BA0.3 based devices, respectively, in good accordance with that obtained from J–V curves. According to statistical analysis of PCE (Fig. S12d), the BA0.2 binary spacer champion device yields a Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.20 V, an FF of 70.0% and a PCE of 15.7%, which are extracted from Fig. 4c. This efficiency value significantly outperforms the PCE record (12–14%) for unary spacer (PEA or BA) Q-2D perovskite (n ≤ 5) devices. It is also notable that no evident hysteresis of J–V characteristics is viewed for the BA0.2 device in the forward and reverse scan directions (Fig. S13). In addition, we also record the stabilized photocurrent and efficiency at the maximum power output point (Fig. 4d), and the photocurrent maintains constant under continuous illumination, producing a stable PCE of 15.2%.
Moreover, BA0.2 based binary spacer devices demonstrate a high Voc with an average value of 1.19 V as shown in Fig. S12b, and the peak value approaches 1.21 V as extracted from the J–V curve in Fig. 5a. This value is among the highest reported Voc obtained for Q-2D perovskite solar cells and is comparable to the 1.21–1.24 V record for 3D perovskite (with a bandgap of ∼1.6 eV) devices. Surprisingly, the loss-in-potential (difference between the bandgap and Voc) is merely 0.39 V, implying extremely small non-radiative recombination losses in BA0.2 binary spacer cells. The non-radiative recombination losses (ΔVoc) can be related to the EQE of a light-emitting diode (LED) employing the following equation ΔVoc = −kT × ln(EQE)/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T denotes the temperature, and q represents the elementary charge. When the BA0.2 based binary spacer device is operated as an LED at an input bias of 2 V, the corresponding bright red emission is observed (inset of Fig. 5a). Moreover, we achieve an EQE value of 2.4% at an injected current density equal to Jsc (Fig. S14b), leading to a ΔVoc of ∼100 mV, which is the smallest reported ΔVoc for Q-2D perovskite cells.
In order to better comprehend the charge recombination process of devices with unary or binary spacers, we chose BA0 and BA0.2 based devices for comparison and then carried out several kinds of characterization including light dependent Voc and Jsc measurements, transient photovoltage measurement (TPV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5b depicts a power-law relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Jsc ∝ Iα), where α close to 1 expresses a solar cell without space charge limit effects, whereas α = 0.75 implies that the device is space charge limited owing to a carrier imbalance. A similar α value of 0.958 and 0.970 is acquired for BA0 and BA0.2 based devices, respectively, manifesting that both devices suffer from negligible space charge limit effects. Furthermore, light dependent Voc can provide important information on the recombination mechanism of devices. The dominant occurrence of trap-assisted recombination predicts that the natural logarithmic relationship between light intensity and Voc has a slope of 2kT/q, while a trap-free relationship delivers a slope of kT/q. Clearly, the slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of light intensity decreases from 1.63kT/q to 1.33kT/q when 20% BA organic spacer is introduced into the PEA2MA3Pb4I13 structure (Fig. 5c). This result indicates that trap-assisted charge recombination can be more effectively suppressed with the addition of a BA spacer, in good agreement with the lower trap density of the BA0.2 binary spacer film as observed in Fig. 3d.
Besides, the charge recombination lifetime can be extracted from the transient photovoltage decay curves, and the comparison of photovoltage transients of BA0 and BA0.2 based devices is shown in Fig. 5d. The BA0 unary spacer device demonstrates a charge recombination lifetime of 363 μs, which increases ∼4 fold in the BA0.2 based binary spacer cell, suggesting lower charge recombination losses in binary spacer devices. To further evaluate the charge recombination dynamics, we compare the EIS results of unary and binary spacer devices. Fig. 5e presents the Nyquist plots of devices measured in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz in the dark. Generally, the small arc in the high-frequency region is mainly attributed to the charge transfer process between perovskites and select contacts with two typical impedance parameters of charge contact resistance (Rcon) and capacitance (C1), while the large arc in the low-frequency range corresponds to the recombination process described by the recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (C2). Obviously, the BA0.2 binary spacer device has a larger Rrec than the BA0 unary spacer cell, manifesting that a stronger recombination process exists in the BA0 based device. Overall, we observe significantly decreased charge recombination losses in BA-containing binary spacer devices according to the light dependent Voc, TPV and EIS results, and such low charge recombination losses can certainly contribute to significant improvements of BA-containing binary spacer device performance.
Additionally, we investigate the stability of BA0 and BA0.2 based devices in ambient air with 40–50% relative humidity, and the corresponding normalized PCEs are shown in Fig. 5f. After storing for 30 days, both unsealed BA0 and BA0.2 based cells show excellent ambient stability, retaining 81% and 88% of their initial efficiency, respectively. These results are close to the recent stability measurements reported in Q-2D perovskite solar cells, supporting the excellent environmental tolerance of Q-2D perovskite devices.

In summary, for the first time, we have successfully designed and fabricated vertically oriented (PEA1−xBAx)2MA3Pb4I13 (x ≤ 0.3) binary organic spacer Q-2D perovskite thin films, and we find that both the surface quality of the perovskite film and the vertical orientation of crystals are significantly enhanced by the incorporation of binary organic spacer PEA–BA. Meanwhile, the binary spacer perovskite films exhibit remarkable improvements of optoelectronic properties with respect to charge transfer dynamics, trap density and hole mobility. The excellent film quality and optoelectronic properties lead to an average PCE of 15.1% in (PEA0.8BA0.2)2MA3Pb4I13 binary spacer devices with a maximum value of 15.7%. This value exceeds the efficiency record (12–14%) for unary spacer (PEA or BA) Q-2D perovskite devices. More importantly, a peak Voc of 1.21 V corresponding to a loss-in-potential of 0.39 V is also obtained, yielding a non-radiative recombination loss of ∼100 mV, which is the smallest reported loss value for Q-2D perovskite devices. In addition, the introduction of binary spacer PEA–BA effectively decreases the device recombination losses, further supporting significant enhancements of binary spacer device performance. Our findings provide an effective organic spacer design strategy which is promising to develop stable and efficient Q-2D perovskite materials and devices.
