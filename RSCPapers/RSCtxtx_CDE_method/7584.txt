Nowadays, organic solar cells (OSCs) with efficiencies over 10% have been achieved through the elaborate design of electron donors and fullerene acceptors. However, the drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, like poor absorption, limited chemical and energetic tunabilities, high-cost purification and morphological instability, have become the bottlenecks for the further improvement of OSCs. To overcome the mentioned shortages from fullerene, research studies on non-fullerene electron acceptors have boomed. To date, the highest efficiency of fullerene-free OSCs has been pushed to be 12%, which surpasses that of fullerene-based OSCs. In this perspective, we focus on summarizing the development of small molecule electron acceptors designed to replace the fullerene derivatives. Since it has been revealed that the search for matched donor:acceptor pairs is important for accomplishing high efficiencies, we therefore divide electron acceptors into several categories according to the donors used in fullerene-free OSCs. After the introduction of these acceptors, we outline the designing rules as well as perspectives for the development of non-fullerene acceptors. We believe that the development of non-fullerene electron acceptors will make organic photovoltaics closer to practical applications.

As one promising sustainable power source, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) with the advantages of light weight, flexibility, low-cost and large-scale production have achieved huge progress in efficiency with values over 10% during recent years. The typical combinations of the active layers are polymer or small molecule donors and fullerene derivatives, e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM). However, the drawbacks of fullerene derivatives (Scheme 1), like poor light absorption, limited chemical and energetic tunabilities, high-cost purification and morphology instability, have become the restricting factors in further breakthrough of efficiency and practical applications. Therefore, many efforts have also been devoted to developing non-fullerene electron acceptors, and efficiencies over 12% have been achieved for fullerene-free OSCs.

Non-fullerene electron acceptors can be divided into two categories, small molecules and polymer acceptors. It is worth noting that the efficient polymer acceptors, such as aromatic imide, and emerging B ← N moiety based polymers have largely improved the performance of those OSCs consisting of both polymeric donors and acceptors. Compared with polymer acceptors, small molecule electron acceptors own additional merits: flexibility in the design of molecular structures and good repeatability in batch to batch production. So at present, much more effort is devoted to developing small molecule electron acceptors.
In fact, the first reported planar heterojunction OSCs by Tang employed a perylene diimide (PDI) derivative as the electron acceptor. Later, Heeger and co-workers developed a fullerene derivative (PC61BM) with the advantages of high electron mobility, isotropic electron transport and fine phase separation, which showed great performance in BHJ OSCs. Since then, fullerene derivatives owned a dominant position as electron acceptors in BHJ OSCs for decades, and researchers paid attention to developing donors for fullerene derivatives. However, non-fullerene electron acceptors started attracting the researchers' attention again in recent years. It began with the modification of the donors by introducing some electron-withdrawing groups, like fluorine, cyanogroups and formyl groups, to lower the energy levels. Later, researchers began to design non-fullerene electron acceptors independently by using some promising building blocks, like diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), PDI, benzothiadiazole and rhodanine. And the geometries of these acceptors were also varying from twisted structures to planar structures. Through many years of exploration, we are getting closer to the successful design of non-fullerene electron acceptors year by year (Scheme 2).
To better use solar photons, a donor–acceptor pair with complementary absorption is needed which is beneficial for achieving high photocurrent. In other words, if the acceptors have a wide band-gap, they can pair with narrow band-gap donors, and vice versa. Absorption properties are some of the key factors for the newly developed non-fullerene electron acceptors, which affect the choice of the corresponding donor to pair with.
Besides the absorption, the energy level is another key factor. Because the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is proportional to the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor, Voc can be increased by lifting the LUMO of the acceptor or using a donor with a deep HOMO. For fullerene-based OSCs, the driving force or the LUMO–LUMO offset should be larger than 0.3 eV; for fullerene-free OSCs, more and more results reveal that the LUMO–LUMO offset or the HOMO–HOMO offset can be smaller than 0.3 eV, which is beneficial for high voltage.
To achieve high efficiencies, the third key factor is the morphology of the active layers, which is related to the geometries of the molecules. Twisted and planar geometries are two dominant designing strategies for non-fullerene electron acceptors. The twisted geometry of the molecules can help suppress the formation of large aggregates and mimic fullerene multi-dimensional charge transfer behaviour, while planar geometry can fulfil high electron mobility and effective π–π stacking. So suitable geometries should be designed to solve both the problems of large domains and π–π stacking.
If high efficiencies can be achieved, then the cost and the stability of the devices become the next issues of concern for practical applications. The drawbacks derived from fullerene acceptors, like high-cost in production and morphological instability, limit this development. However, it can be addressed through non-fullerene electron acceptors.
In this review, we will discuss the small molecule electron acceptors developed for OSC applications in recent years. Owing to the importance of choosing suitable donors for fullerene-free OSCs, the small molecule electron acceptors will be introduced in the following three situations: (1) for commonly used wide bandgap donors of P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)), (2) for typical narrow bandgap donors of PTB7-Th (poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl]), and (3) for other donors. Then, we will outline some design rules as well as perspectives for non-fullerene electron acceptors.

As one of the most studied polymers, P3HT with the features of simple structure, easy-processing and low-cost is a good choice as the donor for practical OSC applications. As a wide bandgap polymer, P3HT shows absorption of around 300–600 nm and energy levels of around −3.0 eV and −5.0 eV. Besides, P3HT shows good crystallinity after thermal annealing. However, the efficiencies of P3HT and PCBM based OSCs can only be 3–5%. Of course, a higher efficiency of 7.4% can be achieved for P3HT based OSCs by using indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA) as the acceptor, but IC70BA is a material with a higher price than PCBM. So, developing non-fullerene electron acceptors with high efficiencies and better stability for P3HT is meaningful.


DPP is a building block with good planarity, good absorption, tunable energy levels and outstanding stability. Owing to the bipolar properties of the DPP unit, its energy levels may not be low enough to pair with narrow band-gap polymers, but low enough to pair with wide band-gap polymers, like P3HT.

What is more, the absorption of P3HT mainly lies in the range of 300–600 nm, while the absorption of DPP derivatives can be red-shifted to more than 600 nm. Therefore, the absorption of P3HT and DPP derivatives can be complementary. In other words, DPP derivatives can be good candidates as non-fullerene electron acceptors for P3HT.
For DPP monomers, the designing strategy is introducing electron-withdrawing groups at the end of the DPP unit to lower the energy levels. For example, Sonar et al. introduced two trifluoromethylphenyl groups to lower the energy levels and extend the absorption to 700 nm (see SM-1 in Fig. 1). After blending with P3HT, the resultant devices could exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1%. But there is still a large part of overlap in the absorption of P3HT and SM-1, so if the absorption can be further red-shifted to longer wavelength, a higher current may be possible. Later, Cabanetos et al. reported an acetylene-bridged DPP derivative end-capped with two phthalimide groups (SM-2). The absorption of SM-2 was red-shifted to 751 nm and the LUMO level was lowered to be −4.13 eV. As a result, a high efficiency of 3.28% was obtained for P3HT:SM-2 based OSCs. However, the extremely low LUMO level can cause the loss of voltage. To broaden the absorption of DPP derivatives, two or more DPP units are used in one molecule. For DPP dimers, the traditional molecular design is connecting two DPP units with an electron-donating or electron-withdrawing central core. For example, Zhan et al. reported a DPP dimer using dibenzosilole as the core (SM-3), and the OSCs based on P3HT:SM-3 blended films could exhibit an efficiency of 2.05% with a high Voc of 0.97 V, which is partly attributed to the high-lying LUMO level (−3.28 eV). When the central core was replaced by fluorene, the efficiency of SM-4 was lowered to 1.20% with a higher voltage of 1.10 V. The loss of efficiency was mainly caused by the loss of current. Comparing the electron mobility, we can find that the electron mobility of SM-4 is only 8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the electron mobility of SM-3 can be as high as 3.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which can explain the difference in current. Later, Bhosale et al. changed the central core into carbazole (SM-5), which could show a higher efficiency of 2.30% and a higher voltage of 1.17 V. Impressively, the fill factor (FF) could also be as high as 0.62, although the current was not outstanding. Other central cores, like indacenodithiophene (IDT) (SM-6, 0.83%) and benzothiadiazole (SM-7, 1.16%), were also tried, but the performances were not better. Furthermore, it is reasonable to modify at the end of the molecules. We reported a benzene end-capped DPP dimer with fluorene as the central core (SM-8). The benzene groups can extend the absorption and adjust the geometry of SM-8. As a result, SM-8 could exhibit a good efficiency of 3.17% and a high voltage of 1.18 V, when blended with P3HT. And the electron mobility of SM-8 was also good with the value of 2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Later on, we reported a DPP dimer with fluorene as the central core and thiophene-2-carbonitrile as the terminal units (SM-9). The introduction of thiophene-2-carbonitrile units lowered the LUMO of SM-9 to −3.65 eV and extended the absorption of SM-9 to be near 800 nm. More impressively, the electron mobility of the blended film was as high as 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. When SM-9 was blended with P3HT, the OSCs could show a PCE of 2.37% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.39. Obviously, Jsc and FF were supposed to be higher. Through mobility characterization, we can find that the hole and electron mobilities are not balanced; and through resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements, we can find that large domains are formed owing to the good planarity of SM-9.
These two reasons should be responsible for the moderate performances.
If more than two DPP units are used in one molecule, then the molecules will have quasi-3D or 3D configurations. As shown in Fig. 1, Zhan et al. reported a star-shaped non-fullerene acceptor, SM-10, with triphenylamine as the core and three DPP units as the arms. The sp3 hybrid orbital of the nitrogen atom could make SM-10 have a propeller-like molecular structure. When blended with P3HT, SM-10 could exhibit an efficiency of 1.20% and an extremely high voltage of 1.18 V. The main factor which limits the efficiency is the current. Through the mobility, we can find that the hole mobility and electron mobility in the blended films are 2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, the mobilities are not balanced and the electron mobility is a bit low, which may be the reason for the limited current and FF. Later, Wan et al. replaced the triphenylamine with spirobifluorene and obtained a DPP tetramer, SM-11. Owing to the optimized molecular geometry and charge transport, the current was improved for P3HT:SM-11 based OSCs when compared with SM-10, thus leading to an improved efficiency of 3.63% with a high voltage of 1.10 V. Besides, Bhosale et al. demonstrated another four-armed DPP derivative, SM-12, with tetraphenylethylene as the core. The optimized devices based on P3HT and SM-12 could show an efficiency of 3.86% with a high voltage of 1.18 V. For such kinds of DPP derivatives with quasi-3D or 3D geometry, one of the common features is high voltage. So if the current can be further improved, then the efficiency can be further enhanced.
Recently, we reported a spirobifluorene and benzene end-capped DPP moiety based acceptor, SM-13.SM-13 possesses a cross-shaped geometry, which can help suppress the formation of large aggregates. The attached benzene groups at the end of the molecule can further adjust the molecular configuration and extend the absorption. As a result, the OSCs based on P3HT:SM-13 blended films could exhibit a PCE of 5.16% with a Voc of 1.14 V, a Jsc of 8.29 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.55 (Table 1). This efficiency is one of the highest efficiencies for P3HT-based fullerene-free OSCs and the highest efficiency for DPP-based acceptors. Under the optimized conditions, the hole and electron mobilities in the blended films are 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Without doubt, the mobilities are balanced and the electron mobility is also high. More impressively, good morphological and device stabilities were observed for P3HT:SM-13 based OSCs, which is very meaningful for future practical applications.

Through the above mentioned results, efficiencies can be improved by designing new small molecule electron acceptors. Another factor which can influence the efficiencies is the device structure. The device structure mainly includes the following two types: the conventional device structure and the inverted device structure. Taking SF(DPPB)4 as an example, the efficiency of 5.16% was achieved with the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:SF(DPPB)4/PFN/Al (shown in Fig. 2a). Recently, we also used the inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PFN/P3HT:SF(DPPB)4/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 2b) to test the device performance (Fig. 2).Fig. 2c shows the J–V curves of the P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 based OSCs with the conventional and inverted device structures. A higher PCE of 6.09% was obtained for the inverted device structure with a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 10.23 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.54. Obviously, the inverted device structure can exhibit higher current, thus leading to the improvement of PCE. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 based OSCs are displayed in Fig. 2d. In the range of 430–650 nm, the EQE values of the inverted device structure are higher than those of the conventional device structure, which means that currents from both the donor and the acceptor are enhanced. This example clearly shows how the device structure affects the device performance of the OSCs.

Besides DPP derivatives, there are also many other small molecule electron acceptors that show good performances by blending with P3HT (see Fig. 3 and Table 2). In 2011, Sellinger et al. reported a benzothiadiazole centered electron acceptor, SM-14, with n-hexyl-phthalimide as the end group.SM-14 possesses a planar geometry, which may be beneficial for π–π stacking. When blended with P3HT, an efficiency of 2.54% was obtained with a moderate current of 4.7 mA cm−2. Comparing the absorption of SM-14 with that of P3HT, we can find that the absorption of SM-14 is overlapped with that of P3HT. In other words, the absorptions of SM-14 and P3HT are not complementary, which may limit the current. In the same year, Wang et al. reported a di-cyano substituted quinacridone derivative, SM-15. Using SM-15 as the electron acceptor, a moderate efficiency of 1.57% was achieved. Owing to the low-lying LUMO of −4.1 eV, the voltage was really low with the value of 0.48 V. In fact, such a low LUMO level is not necessary for electron acceptors when using P3HT as the donor. In 2012, Pei et al. developed a series of new fluoranthene-fused imide (FFI) derivatives, and by introducing electron-withdrawing groups on two sites of the FFI skeleton, the energy levels and the molecular geometries could be tuned. SM-16 was developed by introducing two thiophene groups and one cyano substituent to FFI. The thiophene groups can tune the molecular geometry and the cyano substituent can tune the energy levels. However, the efficiency is only 1.86%. When the thiophene groups are replaced with o-methylphenyl groups, the resultant molecule (SM-17) could show better performance than SM-16 with a higher efficiency of 2.90%. The improvement of efficiency is mainly attributed to the increase of the current and voltage. By keeping the thiophene groups but replacing the cyano substituent with a p-formylphenyl group, the resultant molecule (SM-18) showed a lifted LUMO but a low electron mobility of 2.00 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, SM-18 could exhibit an efficiency of 2.40%, which was higher than that of SM-16 but lower than that of SM-17, with a high voltage of 1.03 V.

In 2013, Hwang et al. synthesized a non-fullerene acceptor with 9,9′-bifluorenylidene as the core and four 9,9-diethyl-9H-fluorene as the arms (SM-19). Unfortunately, the performance was not good, and the efficiency was only 0.26%. But, if only using the core of 9,9′-bifluorenylidene as the electron acceptor (SM-20), the performance is much better than that of SM-19.SM-20 could show an efficiency of 2.28% with a high voltage of 1.07 V. Although SM-20 owns a planar geometry, but once an electron is captured by SM-20, the carbon–carbon double bond connecting two fluorene groups will transform into a carbon–carbon single bond and the molecule will be twisted. This may influence the morphology of the active layer. In 2014, Thayumanavan et al. used 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) as the accepting moiety to construct the molecule SM-21. The efficiency of SM-21 is moderate with the value of 1.51%. In the same year, Chabinyc et al. produced a novel non-fullerene acceptor, SM-22. It has a planar geometry, which may have the problem of aggregation. As a result, the efficiency of SM-22 is only 1.45%. Later, Sauve et al. reported an azadipyrromethene-based Zn(II) complex, SM-23, with a twisted geometry. What is more, the absorption of SM-23 mainly lies in the range of 600–800 nm, which is complementary to that of P3HT. Thus, a high efficiency of 4.1% was obtained with a good current of 9.1 mA cm−2. The hole and electron mobilities were found to be 2.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The balanced mobilities are beneficial for the achievement of high efficiency.
In 2013, Winzenberg et al. reported a linear small molecule acceptor with fluorene as the core and indan-1,3-dione as the terminal, SM-24. The introduction of indan-1,3-dione greatly lowered the LUMO to −3.95 eV. After blending with P3HT, SM-24 could show an efficiency of 2.43%. In 2014, Lim et al. modified SM-24 by replacing the ethylhexyl alkyl chain with an octyl alkyl chain and changing indan-1,3-dione to rhodanine, yielding the molecule SM-25. As a result, the LUMO of SM-25 was lifted to −3.53 eV. As expected, SM-25 could show better performance than SM-24 with a higher efficiency of 3.08%, a higher voltage of 1.03 V and a higher current of 5.70 mA cm−2. Based on the previous works, McCulloch et al. further adjusted SM-25 by replacing the thiophene groups with benzothiadiazole, yielding the molecule SM-26. Surprisingly, though the voltage was lowered, the current and FF were improved, thus leading to a good efficiency of 4.11% for SM-26. What is more, the P3HT:SM-26 blended films could exhibit better morphological stability than the P3HT:PC61BM blended films after thermal treatment at 140 °C for 60 min, which was meaningful for the future practical applications. Furthermore, Zhan et al. continued to modify SM-26 to SM-27 by replacing the fluorene core with the indacenodithiophene (IDT) core. The substituents on the IDT were four hexylphenyl groups which could help prevent the formation of large aggregates. With the extended conjugated length and improved planarity, the electron mobility of P3HT:SM-27 blended films was improved to 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. So the efficiency of SM-27 was further enhanced to 5.12% with an improved current of 8.91 mA cm−2. Very recently, McCulloch et al. made a change on SM-27 by replacing the hexylphenyl substituents with octyl alkyl chains, yielding the molecule SM-28. Thus, SM-28 owned better π–π stacking property. After annealing, the absorption of the SM-28 thin film could even red-shift to more than 800 nm, leading to a broader absorption for the P3HT:SM-28 blended films. Therefore, a high efficiency of 6.40% was achieved with a high current of 14.10 mA cm−2. Besides, the authors also tried another alkyl chain of ethylhexyl, which showed inferior performance to that of octyl alkyl chains. The solar cell stability of P3HT:SM-28 based OSCs was also tested and 73% of the initial PCE was remained after putting the devices in air for 1200 h.

PTB7-Th is another widely used and studied narrow bandgap polymer donor with the onset absorption edge of around 800 nm. Its LUMO and HOMO levels are around −3.64 eV and −5.22 eV, respectively. PTB7-Th is also crystalline, but not as strong as P3HT does, with desired face-on orientation. Through the optimization of the devices, the efficiencies of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based OSCs have been over 10%. So, PTB7-Th is a promising material to pair with non-fullerene acceptors. Depending on the absorption and energy levels of PTB7-Th, the non-fullerene acceptors used to pair with had better have their own better absorption in the short-wavelength region and relatively low-lying energy levels.


PDI units are promising building blocks for non-fullerene acceptors with the advantages of suitable absorption, low-lying energy levels and high electron mobility. The main problem for PDI derivatives is the strong tendency of aggregation, which limits the performances of devices using PDI derivatives as electron acceptors. So it is necessary to design suitable geometries for PDI derivatives in order to avoid the formation of large aggregates (see Fig. 4 and Table 3).

For the PDI monomer, Sun et al. introduced four phenyl groups at the bay position of the PDI chromophore, obtaining the molecule SM-29. Owing to the steric hindrance effect, four phenyl groups are twisted and the PDI plane itself is also non-planar, which can help prevent the formation of large aggregates. Therefore, a good efficiency of 4.10% was obtained when blended with PTB7-Th. If two PDI units are connected directly, twisted geometry can also be formed owing to the large conjugated planes of the PDI units in the limited spaces. According to the different connecting position, PDI derivatives can be divided into bay to bay type and head to head type, which are shown in Fig. 4 (SM-30 and SM-31). For SM-30, the torsion angle was found to be 70°, while the torsion angle for SM-31 was calculated to be 90°.
After blending with PTB7-Th, SM-30 could show an efficiency of 5.56%, while SM-31 could show a better efficiency of 6.41%. The better efficiency of SM-31 is mainly from the increased current and FF when compared with those of SM-30. After recording the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching spectra, it could be found that the PL quenching was more efficient for PTB7-Th:SM-31 blended films than for PTB7-Th:SM-30 blended films, indicating that the exciton dissociation was more efficient in PTB7-Th:SM-31 blended films. Besides, SCLC measurements showed that the electron mobility of PTB7-Th:SM-31 blended films was higher than that of PTB7-Th:SM-30 blended films. These reasons should be responsible for the higher performance of the PTB7-Th:SM-31 blended films. If more than two PDI units are used, some cores with 3D geometry could be applied. For example, Jen et al. used tetraphenylsilane as the core to couple four PDI units, thus forming a sphere-like PDI derivative (SM-32). When SM-32 was used as an electron acceptor, it could exhibit an efficiency of 3.54%. As a comparison, Yan et al. used tetraphenylethylene as the core to couple four PDI units, thus forming a four-wing propeller-shape PDI derivative (SM-33). Even when SM-33 was used as an electron acceptor, it could exhibit a higher efficiency of 5.53%. Obviously, SM-33 can have more efficient π–π stacking than SM-32, which can lead to a higher current. And the high-lying LUMO of SM-33 is beneficial for the achievement of high voltage. These reasons lead to the accomplishment of a higher efficiency. When using spirobifluorene as the core to couple four PDI units, the resultant molecule (SM-34) could also show a good efficiency of 5.34%. Recently, we just used benzene as the core to connect three PDI units, as a result, a simple PDI derivative (SM-35) with a highly twisted geometry was obtained. This highly twisted geometry breaks the molecular coplanarity and symmetry, thus suppressing the strong crystallization tendency of PDI chromophores. So, SM-35 could exhibit a good efficiency of 5.65% when blended with PTB7-Th.
Without doubts, creating twisted geometry is a successful designing strategy for PDI derivatives to solve the problem of large aggregates. But it also needs to be admitted that twisted geometry will hinder efficient π–π stacking. Thus, some researchers started to design PDI derivatives with fused structures. In 2014, Nuckolls et al. fused two PDI units with the ethylene group to get the molecule SM-36. Though it is fully fused, its geometry is still non-planar with a helical configuration. Finally, SM-36 could exhibit a good efficiency of 6.05% when used as an electron acceptor. Later, Jen et al. fused two PDI units with the thiophene group to get the molecule SM-37. Through comparison, it could be found that the LUMO of SM-37 was lifted relative to that of the unfused analogue, which could be beneficial for obtaining high voltage. As a result, SM-37 could exhibit a good efficiency of 6.72% with a high voltage of 0.94 V. To further extend the conjugated length, Nuckolls et al. fused four PDI units with three ethylene groups to obtain the molecule SM-38. Surprisingly, both current and FF were improved, thus SM-38 could show a high efficiency of 8.30% with a high current of 15.20 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 0.68. Through above mentioned three examples, we can conclude that fused PDI derivatives with non-planar geometries can be good candidates of non-fullerene electron acceptors.
In 2016, Marder et al. used 9,9′-bifluorenylidene as the core to couple four PDI units, giving SM-39. But the efficiency was moderate with a value of 3.64%. In most situations, the bay position of the PDI unit is used to connect. Less attention has been paid to the headland position of the PDI units. Yu et al. compared these two positions by designing two PDI dimers with benzodithiophene as the core (see SM-40 and SM-41 in Fig. 4).SM-40 and SM-41 have similar energy levels and absorption, but different geometries. For SM-41, the connection at the headland position will allow more stretched configuration. So SM-41 could have higher electron mobility and current than SM-40. Thus, the efficiency was 4.92% for SM-41, but 3.53% for SM-40. Later, Yu et al. coupled four PDI units at the headland position to get the molecule SM-42.
The performance of SM-42 was very outstanding with the best efficiency of 8.47% and a high current of 18.20 mA cm−2. The SCLC measurement showed that the electron mobility of PTB7-Th:SM-42 blended films was a bit low, but the hole/electron mobilities were balanced. This indicates that balanced mobilities are important.

To pair with PTB7-Th, small molecule electron acceptors should have low-lying energy levels. To lower the energy levels, some groups with strong electron-withdrawing ability should be used, like benzothiadiazole and malononitrile (see Fig. 5 and Table 4). Recently, Beaujuge et al. used 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)malononitrile as the electron-accepting moiety to construct three small molecule electron acceptors by changing the π-bridge groups. The three π-bridge groups used are fluorene (SM-43), carbazole (SM-44) and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (SM-45). SM-43 and SM-44 have similar energy levels and absorptions, while SM-45 has a deep LUMO and red-shifted absorption. As a result, SM-45 could exhibit a higher current but lower voltage than SM-43 and SM-44. However, the efficiencies of these three molecules were similar with the values of 5.10% for SM-43, 5.30% for SM-44 and 5.00% for SM-45.

IDT and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) have fused-ring backbones with four hexylphenyl substituents. These kinds of structures can have efficient π–π stacking while the domains can be tuned by the substituents. Previously, IDT and IDTT groups were successfully used in the donors. Later, Zhan's group tried to use IDT and IDTT to construct small molecule electron acceptors, and excellent performances were achieved. In 2015, Zhan et al. synthesized an electron acceptor with IDT as the core, two thiophenes as the π-bridges, and two 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (IC) groups as the terminals, SM-46. Impressively, the absorption of SM-46 was red-shifted to 800 nm and the LUMO was lowered to −4.04 eV. Besides, SM-46 showed a high electron mobility of 2.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, a good efficiency of 6.31% was achieved when using SM-46 as the electron acceptor. In the same year, Zhan et al. reported another similar molecule by using IDTT as the core and two IC groups as the terminals, SM-47. This molecule had similar absorption to SM-46, but higher electron mobility than SM-46. Therefore, SM-47 could exhibit a higher current and a higher efficiency of 6.80%. After much thought we found that the absorptions of SM-46 and SM-47 are overlapping with that of PTB7-Th. If they can be blended with other polymer donors with complementary absorptions, then maybe higher currents and efficiencies can be obtained. Anyway, these two molecules inspire researchers that fused-ring structures coupling with IC groups can make the molecules good electron acceptors. Thus, other researchers also started to design non-fullerene acceptors using the abovementioned strategy. In 2016, Liao et al. used five-ring fused IDT and ten-ring fused IDTIDT as the cores to couple with the IC group, and obtained the molecules SM-48 and SM-49.SM-49 possessed a higher LUMO, red-shifted absorption and higher electron mobility than SM-48, and thus SM-49 showed better performance with an efficiency of 6.48% than SM-48 with an efficiency of 3.16%. The authors also studied the energy loss for the PTB7-Th:SM-49 based devices and found that it was as low as 0.59 eV, which was responsible for the high voltage. Also in 2016, Chen et al. designed a simple molecule, SM-50, by using fluorene as the core, two thiophene as the π-bridges and two IC groups as the terminals. Its absorption could only be red-shifted to around 700 nm, but this absorption was complementary to that of PTB7-Th. As a result, SM-50 could exhibit a high current more than 16 mA cm−2 and a high efficiency of 7.93%. This example clearly shows that complementary absorption is beneficial for the achievement of high current.

PDBT-T1 (the molecular structure is shown in Fig. 6) was firstly reported by Sun's group in 2015, which could show a high efficiency of 9.7% with a high FF of 0.75 when blended with PC71BM. Compared with PTB7-Th, PDBT-T1 is a medium band-gap polymer donor with the onset absorption edge of around 700 nm. Therefore, PDBT-T1 has higher LUMO (−3.43 eV) and deeper HOMO (−5.36 eV) levels than PTB7-Th (−3.66 eV and −5.22 eV) does. So, high voltage and FF can be expected when using PDBT-T1 as the donor in fullerene-free OSCs. Besides, PDBT-T1 possesses strong crystallinity, which can help form good phase separation when blended with electron acceptors.

Also in 2015, Wang et al. synthesized a novel PDI dimer, SM-51, by inserting two thiophene units in the bay positions. This fused and extended heteroarene can lead to a more twisted geometry and lift the LUMO of SM-51. Then SM-51 was used as an electron acceptor to blend with PDBT-T1, and a good efficiency of 7.16% was achieved with a high voltage of 0.90 V and a high FF of 0.66, but the current was moderate. Later in 2016, Wang et al. synthesized an analogue of SM-51 by replacing the thiophene rings with selenophene rings and obtained the molecule SM-52.SM-52 has similar absorption and energy levels to SM-51, but the selenium atoms can increase the charge carrier mobilities and intermolecular interactions, and thus, SM-52 could exhibit a higher efficiency of 8.42% with a higher voltage of 0.96 V, a higher current of 12.49 mA cm−2 and a higher FF of 0.70 (see Table 5).

It has been proved that the coupling of IDT or IDTT with IC groups can lead to good electron acceptors. Later in 2016, Zhan et al. further modified their previously reported molecules to get some electron acceptors with higher performances. Firstly, they only kept one IDT unit and two IC groups as the main backbone and replaced four hexylphenyl substituents with four linear hexyl alkyl chains, giving SM-53. As a result, SM-53 owns a high electron mobility of 1.10 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and efficient π–π stacking. Because of the narrow band-gap of SM-53, PDBT-T1 was used as the donor in order to have complementary absorptions. Thus, a high efficiency of 8.71% was obtained with a high current of 15.05 mA cm−2 for as-cast OSCs. Then, they modified SM-47 by replacing four hexylphenyl substituents with four hexylthienyl substituents and obtained the molecule SM-54.SM-54 shows lower energy levels and higher electron mobility than SM-47. Therefore, when blended with PDBT-T1, SM-54 could exhibit a high efficiency of 9.60% with a high current of 16.24 mA cm−2.

PBDTTT-C-T (the molecular structure is shown in Fig. 7) was firstly reported by Hou's group in 2011, which was an analogue of PTB7-Th, with the lack of the fluorine atom and by changing the substituent on the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) group. Compared with PTB7-Th, PBDTTT-C-T has high-lying LUMO and HOMO (−3.25 eV and −5.11 eV) levels and a similar absorption range (500–800 nm). As for crystallinity, PBDTTT-C-T and PTB7-Th are close to each other. So, PBDTTT-C-T can pair with some electron acceptors with high-lying energy levels.

In 2013, Yao et al. reported a PDI dimer, SM-55, by using thiophene as the spacer. The insertion of thiophene could not only help adjust the geometry, but also extend the absorption of SM-55. When blended with PBDTTT-C-T, SM-55 could show an efficiency of 4.03%, which was impressive at that time. After this, researchers got the idea of obtaining high-performance PDI derivatives, namely creating twisted geometries. In the next year, Zhan et al. used triphenylamine as the core to construct a quasi-3D PDI derivative, SM-56.
Owing to the twisted geometry, the electron mobility of SM-56 was not high with the value of 3.00 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and thus a moderate efficiency of 3.32% was obtained. There was also an attempt to replace the PDI of SM-55 with NDI to get the molecule SM-57, but the performance was not good. In 2015, Zhan et al. reported two small molecule electron acceptors with 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)-malononitrile (BM) as the electron-withdrawing units and IDT or IDTT as the electron-donating units, SM-58 and SM-59. Obviously, SM-59 exhibited a bit more red-shifted absorption and higher electron mobility than SM-58. As a result, SM-59 showed a bit higher efficiency of 4.81% than that (4.26%) of SM-58 (Table 6).

Yan's group developed a series of polymer donors based on 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole and four thiophene units, which could show high efficiencies over 10%. PffBT4T-2DT (the molecular structure is shown in Fig. 8) was one of them. These kinds of polymer donors have high crystallinity and preferential face-on orientation, thus leading to high hole mobilities. The absorption of PffBT4T-2DT can also be near 800 nm but a little blue-shifted when compared with that of PTB7-Th. Besides, PffBT4T-2DT owns deeper LUMO (−3.71 eV) and HOMO (−5.36 eV) levels than PTB7-Th (−3.66 eV and −5.22 eV).

In 2015, Yan et al. used PffBT4T-2DT as the donor to pair with a PDI dimer (SM-60) with spirobifluorene as the spacer. The complementary absorption and the small driving force led to the achievement of a high efficiency of 6.30% and a high voltage of 0.98 V. Also in the same year, Yan et al. developed two PDI derivatives by using bithiophene as the spacer, SM-61 and SM-62. The different positions of the methyl groups on the bithiophene units cause the differences in the geometries. SM-61 has a bigger dihedral angle between the two thiophene rings, but a smaller dihedral angle between the two PDI planes than SM-62. Finally, SM-61 could exhibit a bit higher efficiency of 4.10% than that (3.10%) of SM-62. Besides, Yan et al. synthesized three PDI derivatives, SM-63, SM-64 and SM-65, with 3D geometries by using tetraphenylmethane, tetraphenylsilane and tetraphenylgermane as the core, respectively. These three molecules have similar energy levels and absorption, but the electron mobility of SM-65 is lower than those of SM-63 and SM-64. Therefore, when blended with PffBT4T-2DT, SM-65 showed lower current and FF than SM-63 and SM-64. So the efficiency was only 1.60% for SM-65, while the efficiencies were 4.30% for SM-63 and 4.20% for SM-64, respectively (Table 7).

In 2013, Jenekhe et al. designed and synthesized a new building block, tetraazabenzodifluoranthene diimide, which could be used as an electron-withdrawing group. In molecular structures, this new building block is the extension of the PDI unit. So the problem of forming large aggregates also exists for this new building block. To solve this problem, they introduced one thiophene as the spacer to connect two of this new building block and two phenyl groups at the left and right sides of the resultant molecule, SM-66 (see Fig. 9). This arrangement of molecular structures leads to a twisted configuration with a dihedral angle of 33° between these two new building blocks. To pair with SM-66, a new polymer donor was synthesized and used, which was named as PSEHTT. PSEHTT is a medium band-gap polymer with the LUMO of −3.30 eV, the HOMO of −5.10 eV and the onset absorption edge of around 700 nm. After blending PSEHTT with SM-66, an efficiency of 5.04% was achieved. Later, they further modified SM-66 by replacing the thiophene with selenophene, 3,4-dimethylthiophene and 3,6-dimethylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene to adjust the twisted angles and geometries, thus getting three molecules, SM-67, SM-68 and SM-69. As a result, the dihedral angles between these two new building blocks were calculated to be 40° for SM-67, 62° for SM-68 and 53° for SM-69, respectively. When blended with PSEHTT, SM-68 could show a better efficiency of 6.37% than SM-67 (2.61%) and SM-69 (3.94%). In 2016, they used 2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine as the spacer to get a new molecule SM-70, and the dihedral angle was further increased to 76°. Still using PSEHTT as the donor, a high efficiency of 8.10% was obtained. The authors also compared the results of SM-66–SM-70, and found a relationship between the dihedral angles and the efficiencies. It seems to be that the bigger the dihedral angles are, the higher the efficiencies will be, except SM-66 (Table 8).

As we know, PCE is decided by three factors: Jsc, Voc and FF. For fullerene-based OSCs, current and FF can be obtained with high values, but the voltage is relatively not high with the limit that the driving forces between the donors and the acceptors should be larger than 0.3 eV. However, for fullerene-free OSCs, this rule is not applicative. This means that the voltage loss can be small, and high voltage can be obtained easily for fullerene-free OSCs.

To have the properties of small driving forces and fast charge separation, both the donors and the acceptors should be selected carefully. The miscibility and compatibility of the blends will make a big difference in the performances. For the same non-fullerene acceptor, the different choices of the donors may lead to different results. For example, ITIC was firstly developed to blend with PTB7-Th, and an efficiency of 6.80% was achieved. However, the blends of ITIC and PTB7-Th have the problems of overlapped absorption and high voltage loss, and thus the current and voltage are moderate. Later, Hou's group used another polymer donor, PBDB-T, to blend with ITIC (Fig. 10). PBDB-T is a wide band-gap polymer donor with the onset absorption edge of around 700 nm. Compared with PTB7-Th, PBDB-T has a deeper HOMO and blue-shifted absorption. So, the absorption of PBDB-T is complementary to that of ITIC, which is beneficial for obtaining high current. Besides, the deeper HOMO of PBDB-T makes the DHOMO (the difference between the HOMO of PBDB-T and the HOMO of ITIC) become smaller than 0.3 eV with the value of 0.18 eV. Though the DHOMO is as small as 0.18 eV, efficient exciton dissociation can still be accomplished. Therefore, higher current and higher voltage were obtained for the blends of ITIC and PBDB-T than those for the blends of ITIC and PTB7-Th. Finally, an excellent efficiency of 11.21% was achieved with a current of 16.81 mA cm−2, a voltage of 0.90 V and a FF of 0.74 for PBDB-T:ITIC based OSCs. This example shows that the DHOMO can be smaller than 0.3 eV for fullerene-free OSCs.
Then, how about the DLUMO (the difference between the LUMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor)? As shown above, Yan's group once used PffBT4T-2DT as the donor to pair with SF-PDI2 and an efficiency of 6.30% was obtained. Later, Yan's group developed another polymer donor, P3TEA, to pair with SF-PDI2 (Fig. 11). Certainly, the absorption of P3TEA is complementary to that of SF-PDI2.
More importantly, the DLUMO is so small with the value of 0.05 eV. This means that the LUMO of P3TEA and the LUMO of SF-PDI2 are nearly the same. Through such a small DLUMO, fast charge separation can still be achieved for the blends of SF-PDI2 and P3TEA. Finally, a good efficiency of 9.50% was obtained with a current of 13.27 mA cm−2, a high voltage of 1.11 V and a FF of 0.64 for P3TEA:SF-PDI2 based OSCs. This example shows that the DLUMO can be smaller than 0.3 eV for fullerene-free OSCs.
What if both the DHOMO and the DLUMO are smaller than 0.3 eV? Very recently, we reported a new non-fullerene acceptor, FITP, by fusing two PDI units with the IDTT core (Fig. 12). This fully fused backbone makes FITP possess superior charge carrier transport properties and an elevated LUMO. When FITP was blended with PTB7-Th, the DHOMO and the DLUMO were found to be 0.26 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively, both of which were smaller than 0.3 eV. However, a high efficiency of 7.33% was still obtained. And another impressive performance was the high voltage with the value of 0.99 eV, especially for such narrow band-gap polymer donor (PTB7-Th) based OSCs. Clearly, this example shows that both the DHOMO and the DLUMO can be smaller than 0.3 eV at the same time for fullerene-free OSCs, which is a big difference from that of fullerene-based OSCs.

In summary, through the development of numerous non-fullerene acceptors in recent years, the superiorities of fullerene-free OSCs, like broader cover of the absorption, lower energy loss for high voltage, and better stability for practical applications, have become more and more obvious. Based on these, the efficiencies of fullerene-free OSCs have also caught up with the pace of fullerene-based OSCs.

To design suitable non-fullerene acceptors, the three main factors to be considered are absorption, energy levels and geometry. The controlled absorption can be tuned by the design of chemical structures and the absorption ranges can be guessed after the design of chemical structures. Nowadays, different kinds of non-fullerene acceptors with a wide band-gap (onset absorption edge: ∼600 nm), a medium band-gap (onset absorption edge: ∼700 nm) or a narrow band-gap (onset absorption edge: ∼800 nm) have been designed and obtained. Once the non-fullerene acceptors have been established, the donors used to pair with them should have complementary absorption with those of non-fullerene acceptors.
For fullerene-free OSCs, the voltages can benefit from two aspects: (1) tunable energy levels of non-fullerene acceptors will allow larger differences between the HOMOs of the donors and the LUMOs of the acceptors, while the HOMO–LUMO differences are in proportion to the voltages; (2) low energy loss will allow the voltages to be closer to the HOMO–LUMO differences, thus leading to higher voltages. Similarly, the energy levels can also be controlled by the design of the chemical structures.
As the third factor, geometry is inconceivable and what kinds of geometries are the best choice is not predictable. But two things are certain: (1) large domains should be avoided since the length of charge carrier transport is limited; (2) efficient π–π stacking should be maintained in order to have good performances. If these two things are achieved by suitable design of geometries, then good performances can be expected.
Since the BHJ active layers are composed of donors and acceptors, the morphologies of the BHJ active layers are decided by both these two components. When the acceptors are carefully designed, the donors also need to be selected carefully. Besides complementary absorption and matched energy levels, the packing behaviour of the donors also matters. Since non-fullerene electron acceptors are somehow analogues of the donors, if the donors chosen have the self-assembly phenomenon even in solution, then the packing of the donors will influence that of the acceptors, thus leading to good phase separation in the blended films. To make donors possess such a property, the donors should have strong crystallinity. Of course, further exploration needs to be made and more and more researchers need to design different kinds of donors for the non-fullerene electron acceptors.
What is more, the charge separation mechanism of fullerene-free OSCs would be different from that of fullerene-based OSCs. And the reasons why the driving forces can be smaller than 0.3 eV and why the voltage can be so high for fullerene-free OSCs still remain mysteries. So, the research of the mechanism is also important for the understanding of fullerene-free OSCs.
At present, the efficiencies of fullerene-free OSCs have been over 12%. Then what can we expect in the future? Are efficiencies of 15% possible? If the voltage is 1 V, the current is 20 mA cm−2 and the FF is 0.75, then the efficiency is 15%. As we know, a voltage of 1 V is accessible for fullerene-free OSCs, and a FF of 0.75 is also possible. As for the current, the value of 20 mA cm−2 has been reported for fullerene-based OSCs. But for fullerene-free OSCs, considering the broad and strong absorption of non-fullerene active blends, the improvement of device current for fullerene-free OSCs still has much scope for exploration. The central problem is how one can obtain high voltage, current and FF simultaneously in one device with the unique material combination. These problems need to be studied and solved in the future. Nevertheless, the exciting progress made for fullerene-free OSCs pushes organic photovoltaics closer to practical considerations and we believe that there is a promising future for organic photovoltaics.
