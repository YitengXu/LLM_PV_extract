The fundamental principles of how a third component influences morphology evolution in ternary solar cells remains poorly understood. Here, P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT with different side chain lengths were incorporated into a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system to investigate the morphology evolution of films from a single component to binary blend films and from binary to ternary blend films. The compatibility between different components determined the final morphology of active layers during film formation, which could be described by Flory–Huggins parameters calculated through a melting point depression method. P3BT could promote crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in ternary blends to afford an optimized morphology, reaching a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.3% after further annealing treatment.

Great efforts, including synthesizing novel donor or acceptor materials, optimizing device structures, and carefully controlling active layer morphology, have been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades, and PCEs of over 13% based on single bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices have been recorded. However, due to traditional binary active layers containing one donor and one acceptor material lacking the ability for sufficient photon harvesting, further improvement in the performance of single-junction OSCs remains limited. To address the optical limitations, tandem and ternary OSCs are utilized to generate high current through multiple organic materials that harvest light energy. Of these, ternary OSCs exhibit great potential to achieve high photocurrent generation while maintaining the simple fabrication conditions that are used to create single bulk heterojunction solar cells.

In order to achieve a better performance with ternary OSCs than those of their corresponding binary OSCs, the optoelectronic properties of the third component should be carefully selected. The light absorption of the third component is usually required to complement that of the binary active layer to increase the short-circuit current (Jsc). In addition, an appropriate energy level can help to reduce energy loss and increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Unfortunately, many third components with excellent optical and electronic matches prove unsuccessful due to an unfavorable morphology resulting in an undesirable device performance. As well as changing the optical and electrical properties, the introduction of a third component with dissimilar optoelectronic and chemical characteristics compared to the binary matrix may simultaneously change the morphology of the active layer, for example by affecting the crystallization of the donor, the aggregation of fullerenes, and the extent of phase separation, and by introducing recombination centers or morphological traps for charge carriers, thereby affecting the fill factor (FF) and the Jsc. The sensitive active layer morphology often makes it challenging to translate a potential sensitization effect into a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Thus, to further improve the device efficiencies in ternary OSCs, accurate prediction of ternary active layer morphology evolution is needed, and a basic understanding of the factors governing morphology evolution in ternary OSCs in order to select the optimal third component is urgently required.
The surface energy of substrates, crystallization, and compatibility between donor and acceptor are generally considered to be driving forces that determine the active layer morphology in binary OSCs. Unlike binary blend films, a ternary blend system composed of multiple components generally affords a complex morphology containing multiple phase structures with different sizes, such as a crystalline donor phase, an acceptor phase, a third component phase, a blending phase of donor and acceptor, and free molecules. Theories for binary systems often conflict when applied in ternary systems. In addition, characterizing the morphology of an active layer film with a thickness of only 100 nm is a challenging task. For example, in binary OSCs, the compatibility of components drives phase separation in the active layer, playing a vital role in exciton separation and charge transport, which could be defined by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ). The relatively small χ value indicates strong attractive interactions between the two components in mixtures, leading to less obvious phase separation between donor and acceptor, and vice versa. So far, χ measurements in this field are rare, especially for ternary OSCs. Gomez et al. calculated the χ between P3HT and PCBM by measuring the melting point depression of P3HT in P3HT:PCBM mixtures. They believed that the partial compatibility drives P3HT to form crystals and leads to phase separation between P3HT and PCBM. Brabec et al. calculated the χ of mixtures by measuring the solubility parameters of PTB7-Th and fullerene derivatives to demonstrate that better compatibility between PTB7-Th and two novel fullerenes led to reduced phase separation as well as a thermodynamic steady state to improve thermal stability. In ternary OSCs, some researchers believed that good compatibility between a third component and a donor (or acceptor) improved the device performance. Controversially, Ade et al. found that good compatibility between two donor polymers with a tendency to alloy is unfavorable to the device performance. Moreover, Ameri et al. suggested that crystallization of Si-PCPDTBT drives the nanostructural evolution in P3HT:ICBA ternary systems, while the driving force is absent in ternary blends, despite excellent miscibility/compatibility between the two sensitizers and ICBA as well as P3HT. Therefore, the role of compatibility between the three components in the morphology of the active layer needs to be clarified for further investigation, as there is no clear set of structure–function relationships to aid component selection and determine the operating mechanism of ternary solar cells.
Here, in order to investigate the mechanism by which the third component and its chemical structure influence the active layer morphology, three ternary inverted OSCs are designed and fabricated by incorporating poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) into a host binary blended p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system. The p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 is chosen due to its relatively high crystallinity; thus, the change in crystallization will be observed more easily in ternary blends. Poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) are widely studied p-type semiconducting conjugated polymer donors, while poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT) are selected as the third component, having the same main chain but different side chain lengths. The influence of the three polymers on light absorption, crystallization of small molecules, aggregation of fullerene, phase separation between donor and acceptor, and photovoltaic performance was investigated systematically. We also investigated the film formation of the ternary active layer through carefully observing changes in morphology in the active layer from single component to binary blends, and from binary blends to ternary blends. It is found that the final morphology of ternary blends is determined by compatibility between the polymer, small molecule, and fullerene. The side chain lengths of the polymer influence the compatibility between the polymer and the small molecule, and the polymer and fullerene, thus affecting the morphology of the ternary blends and the performance of ternary solar cells. Through calculating the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters between the different components via the melting point depression method, P3BT is found to be more compatible with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM, affording a maximum PCE of 7.3% due to increased crystallization as well as optimized phase separation.

The p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech Inc. PC71BM was purchased from Nano-C Inc. P3BT (Mw = 15000 g mol−1, head-to-tail regioregularity of 97%), P3HT (Mw = 48300 g mol−1, head-to-tail regioregularity of 95%), and P3OT (Mw = 32013 g mol−1, head-to-tail regioregularity of 95%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, ≥99.0%, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.28 g of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, ≥99.0%, Sigma Aldrich) in 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, ≥99.8%, Sigma Aldrich). Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was purchased from Delta Technologies Limited, whereas chlorobenzene (CB) was purchased from Aldrich. All the reagents were used directly as received without further purification.


Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were ultrasonically and sequentially washed with acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol for 15 min each and dried in a nitrogen flow. After UV treatment for 20 min, a ZnO electron transport layer was prepared from a ZnO precursor solution through spin coating at 4000 rpm. The ZnO substrates were then baked in air at 205 °C for 1 h. Active layer solutions (D/A ratio 3:2) with an overall concentration of 35 mg mL−1 were prepared in CB. The prepared solutions were annealed at 90 °C before film casting for 15 min. Active layers were spin coated at 1750 rpm for 45 s on top of the ZnO layer under a nitrogen atmosphere (the film thickness was about 120 nm). At a pressure of approximately 10−6 Torr, 7 nm of MoO3 was deposited as the anode interlayer, and 90 nm of Ag was deposited as the top electrode.


Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed with PerkinElmer Lambda 750 and Shimadzu IR Prestige-21 spectrophotometers, respectively. Polarizing optical microscopy (POM) images were obtained with a NIKON E600 POL instrument equipped with a camera. To study the morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed with a Nanoscope III A scanning probe microscope and a JEM-2010 HR microscope, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a TA DSC Q2000 differential scanning calorimeter, with the samples being heated to 300 °C and then cooled to 40 °C at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. Photocurrent/voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G irradiation (Abet Solar Simulator Sun 2000) with an OSC device area of 4 mm2. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, USA. The incident angle was 0.14°, which maximized the scattering intensity from the samples. The scattered X-rays were detected with a Dectris Pilatus 2 M photon counting detector.


The chemical structures of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, PC71BM, P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT as well as the corresponding energy levels are given in Fig. 1a and b. It is worth noting that the energy levels of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, the three polymers, and PC71BM are not in accordance with the cascade energy level, which could facilitate charge collection to improve the Jsc. Three inverted ternary OSCs (Fig. 1c) were designed and fabricated by incorporating P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT into p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM systems. As described in the Experimental section, in order to avoid the influence of solvent additives and processing technology, all the samples used for investigations were fabricated without additives or annealing treatment. Besides, to exclude the effects of the weight ratios of the three polymers on the morphology of the active layers and the corresponding device performance, we selected weight ratios of 10 wt% P3ATs (the best performance) in the donor. In this case, the weight ratios of P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM were maintained at 3:27:20.


To study the effect of P3ATs on the absorption behavior of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM, the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra were examined. Fig. 2a shows the solid-state film absorption of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, P3BT, P3HT, P3OT, and PC71BM. It is observed that P3ATs show an apparent absorption spectral complementation with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM, which enhances the photon harvesting of the active layer. After incorporation of 10 wt% P3ATs into p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, the binary blend films exhibit significant absorption between 400 and 700 nm as shown in Fig. 2b, which is ascribed to the complementary absorption of the polymer and small molecule. In the normalized absorption spectra (Fig. 2c), the shoulder peak at about 678 nm in binary blend films is apparently reduced as compared with the pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film, indicating that π–π stacking of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules is weakened by P3ATs. It is believed that the polymers disturbed the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in binary blends. In Fig. 2d, due to the complementary light absorption of P3ATs and PC71BM, the three binary blends show higher absorption intensity between 400 and 500 nm as compared with pristine PC71BM film. Unlike p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and its blends with P3ATs, the amount of PC71BM remains constant after mixing with P3ATs. However, the absorption intensity between 500 and 670 nm of the three binary blends was seriously reduced in contrast to that of pristine PC71BM film, suggesting that aggregation of PC71BM might be inhibited upon incorporation of P3ATs.

The effect of P3ATs on the crystallization behavior of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM was further analyzed by DSC, and the sample powders were prepared by dissolving and drying. As shown in Fig. 2e, the pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 shows a melting temperature (Tm) and a crystallization temperature (Tc) at 207.7 °C and 172.0 °C, respectively. The corresponding melting enthalpy (ΔHm) and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) were determined as 74.9 J g−1 and 72.5 J g−1, respectively. Concerning the P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 blends, no melting or crystallization peaks of P3ATs could be observed, and Tm and Tc for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 gradually increased with the polymer side chain length. Besides, the ΔHm and ΔHc values of the P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 blends significantly decreased as compared to those of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, while both ΔHm and ΔHc increased slightly with the polymer side chain length. No melting peak could be observed for pristine PC71BM or P3ATs:PC71BM blends as illustrated in Fig. 2f. It is noted that PC71BM exhibits a crystallization peak at 277.0 °C with a ΔHc of 10.9 J g−1. In addition, no crystallization peak was observed for the P3BT:PC71BM binary blend. For the P3HT:PC71BM binary blend, two crystallization peaks were observed. The peak at 156.3 °C was assigned to P3HT crystallization, while that at 276.6 °C with a ΔHc of 5.1 J g−1 was assigned to PC71BM crystallization. For the P3OT:PC71BM binary blends, two crystallization peaks were also noticed. The peak at 129.7 °C was assigned to P3OT crystallization, while that at 272.0 °C with a ΔHc of 7.1 J g−1 was attributed to PC71BM crystallization. It is indicated that P3ATs not only affect the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 but also influence the crystallization of PC71BM. The shorter the side chain length of the P3ATs, the stronger the inhibition of crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM, which is consistent with the polarized optical microscopy (POM) observations (Fig. S1, ESI).
Tapping-mode AFM and TEM were used to further investigate the morphology evolution of films from single component to binary blends (the corresponding AFM phase images are shown in Fig. S2, ESI). As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 (ESI), the surface of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film is relatively homogeneous, having fibers with sizes of hundreds of nanometers that were assigned to p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystals. After blending with P3BT, the quantity of fibers decreased, although their size slightly increased as compared with pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film. Moreover, the quantity of fibers gradually increased with the side chain length of the P3ATs, while their size decreased. In all, the quantity of fibers in binary blends is less than in pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film, showing that crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is restricted by P3ATs. From the TEM observations shown in Fig. 3, the phase separation increased gradually when p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was mixed with P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT. For the PC71BM film, strip aggregates of several microns in length could be seen. When blended with P3BT, the size of the strip aggregates decreased. Additionally, the quantity of strip aggregates continuously decreased, accompanied by the appearance of spherical aggregates after blending with P3HT. In the P3OT:PC71BM blend, the strip aggregates almost disappeared and the spherical aggregates grew to about 200 nm. The phase separation gradually increased with the polymer side chain length when PC71BM was mixed with P3ATs.


Fig. 4a shows of UV-vis absorption spectra of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film without and with 10 wt% P3ATs. Compared to p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film, the three ternary blends show higher absorption intensity between 400 and 550 nm, which is ascribed to P3AT absorption. The enhanced absorption may eventually lead to an increased short-circuit current. The intensity of the shoulder absorption peak at about 678 nm in the ternary blends is different, depending on the side chain length of the P3ATs. By normalizing the absorption spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI), it can be noted that π–π stacking of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is enhanced by incorporating P3BT. However, incorporation of P3HT does not significantly affect the π–π stacking of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, while the π–π stacking of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 deteriorates after mixing with P3OT. The effect of P3ATs on the crystallization behavior of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in ternary blends was then further investigated by DSC. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film exhibits a relatively sharp melting peak at 196.0 °C with a ΔHm of 30.4 J g−1, and a crystallization peak at 127.8 °C with a ΔHc of 28.3 J g−1, attributed to p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. It was found that the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was greatly inhibited in the presence of PC71BM as compared with pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. After blending with 10 wt% P3BT, the crystallization peak shifted to higher temperature at 134.3 °C, accompanied by an increase in ΔHc to 30.1 J g−1. However, when 10 wt% P3HT or 10 wt% P3OT was incorporated, the crystallization peaks shifted to lower temperatures of 125.0 °C and 122.6 °C, and the corresponding ΔHc decreased to 27.5 J g−1 and 25.6 J g−1, respectively. The melting peaks of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 slightly shifted to lower temperatures upon blending with P3ATs. Except for the enhancement of ΔHm induced by P3BT, the other specimens show a reduced ΔHm. The above results indicate that incorporating P3BT into p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM could promote crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, while the addition of P3HT or P3OT significantly inhibits the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Additionally, the inhibition of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization by P3OT is more obvious.

GIWAXS was applied to further probe the molecular stacking and orientation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in ternary blends. Fig. 5 presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns of ternary blends and corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane cuts. The peak at 0.29 A−1 represents the strong lamellar diffraction of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, corresponding to a distance of 2.2 nm. For p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 exhibits a relatively high degree of molecular ordering as evidenced by the strong lamellar (100) diffraction peak at 0.39 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 1.6 nm. A strong π–π stacking (010) peak is seen at q = 1.73 A−1, corresponding to a distance of 0.36 nm. The diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction indicated that p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 tends to form a preferential edge-on orientation in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film. In addition, PC71BM exhibits an ordering peak at q = 1.33 A−1 in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions. After incorporating 10 wt% P3BT, the lamellar (100) diffraction becomes more intense and sharper, thus indicating that crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 is enhanced by P3BT. Besides, the face-on π–π stacking peak (010) becomes more intense in the 2D images and sharper in the in-plane direction, indicating an increased ratio of edge-on oriented molecules. However, when 10 wt% P3HT and P3OT are incorporated, the lamellar (100) diffraction in the out-of-plane direction is weaker than that of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film, indicating that the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 is inhibited by P3HT and P3OT. Furthermore, the inhibition of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization by P3OT is more obvious. Moreover, the slightly stronger face-on π–π stacking peak (010) in the 2D images reveals that the incorporated P3HT and P3OT increase the ratio of face-on oriented molecules.
The effect of P3ATs on the surface and bulk morphology of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 6a, the surface of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film is smooth with a roughness (Rq) of 0.396 nm. After incorporation of P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT, the Rq is slightly increased. It is worth noting that there are some fibrils with lengths of about 15–30 nm, which are attributed to the enhanced p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization induced by P3BT, in the phase images of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P3BT:PC71BM ternary blends (Fig. S4, ESI). As shown in Fig. 6b, the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM films containing 0 wt%, 10 wt% P3BT, and 10 wt% P3HT are highly homogeneous; no significant phase separation could be observed. The p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P3HT:PC71BM ternary blends show almost no discernible structure, while p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P3BT:PC71BM ternary blends show some fibril structure, which is consistent with Fig. S4 (ESI). In addition, the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P3OT:PC71BM ternary blends show significant phase separation; the large black regions are attributed to PC71BM aggregation.

In order to understand the correlation between morphology and device performance, the charge carrier mobility of the ternary active layer was estimated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method according to the Mott–Gurney equation. The thickness of the active layer for SCLC measurement was about 120 nm. The J1/2–V characteristics of hole-only and electron-only devices are plotted in Fig. S5a and b (ESI), respectively. A summary of carrier mobility that was fitted with the SCLC model is given in Table S1 (ESI), and the hole mobility and electron mobility based on a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM device are 2.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.40 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After incorporating 10 wt% P3BT, the hole mobility increases to 2.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to promotion of crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 by P3BT. In addition, the electron mobility is increased to 8.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is attributed to optimized phase separation. The higher carrier mobility improves the charge collection in the electrode, which improves the Jsc value of the device. Besides, the more closely matching hole and electron mobility can reduce bimolecular recombination in order to improve the device's FF. However, the hole mobility was slightly reduced by the addition of P3HT, and the electron mobility decreased significantly. This is due to the inhibition of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization and significant phase separation. Additionally, P3OT inhibited p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization to a greater extent, and the increased phase separation eventually led to a reduction in hole mobility and electron mobility to 5.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film with various weight percentages of P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. Fig. S5c (ESI) presents the illuminated current–voltage (J–V) curve characteristics of the devices under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) light intensity, and the detailed device performance parameters are given in Table S2 (ESI). The active layer was processed from CB without solvent additive or annealing treatment, which resulted in a relatively low PCE. The devices based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 2.0%, with a Jsc of 6.97 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.786 V, and a FF of 35.7%. The best performance was achieved when 10 wt% P3BT was incorporated into p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM, with a Jsc of 8.25 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.812 V, a FF of 50.9%, and a PCE of 3.4%. The increased Voc may be ascribed to the lower HOMO level of P3BT. Besides, the increased Jsc mainly contributes to the enhanced crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, which can lead to more efficient charge transport. The more closely matching holes and electron mobility can reduce bimolecular recombination to improve the FF. After incorporation of 10 wt% P3HT, the improvement in Voc arising from the similar HOMO levels of P3HT and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is limited. In addition, the inhibited crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 affected the charge transfer, resulting in a lower Jsc of 6.80 mA cm−2 and a FF of 35.4%. The PCE of 1.9% indicates that the addition of P3HT does not benefit the device performance. Moreover, the device with the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P3OT:PC71BM blend shows an undesirable PCE of 1.4%. The higher HOMO level of P3OT causes the Voc to decrease to 0.765 V. In the presence of P3OT, the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is weaker. Meanwhile, the large PC71BM aggregates and the increased phase separation depress the charge transfer, and the excitons are more likely to be captured by traps. This resulted in a lower Jsc of 5.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 31.5%. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement is presented in Fig. S5d (ESI); the integrated Jsc is consistent with the J–V measurement within 3% error.
It is worth mentioning that the device performance is not yet optimal due to a lack of alternative treatments. Thermal annealing, solvent annealing, and high boiling solvent annealing were usually used to improve device performance in binary OSCs and were also successfully applied to ternary OSCs. The ternary OSC devices are optimized under the following four conditions: (1) thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 min (A); (2) post-annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (PA); (3) solvent annealing for 30 min (SA); and (4) solvent annealing for 30 min and post-annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (SA + PA). The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters are listed in Fig. S6 (ESI) and Table 1, respectively. For the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM solar cells, the PCE reached 3.0% and 3.8% after thermal annealing and post-annealing due to improvement of the Jsc and FF. Although solvent annealing can significantly improve the Jsc and FF, the Voc is reduced. Through post-annealing, the reduced Voc caused by solvent annealing could be recovered; thus, the PCE increased from 4.3% to 6.6%. It is encouraging that the Jsc, Voc, and FF all improved under the four optimization conditions for ternary OSC devices with 10 wt% P3BT. The PCE of ternary OSCs reached 5.0%, 5.2%, 5.2%, and 7.3%, respectively. The improvement in the device performance may be due to optimized active layer morphology after thermal annealing and solvent annealing. AFM was used to study the effect of thermal annealing and solvent annealing on the active layer morphology. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI), the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is enhanced and phase separation of the active layer increases after thermal annealing and solvent annealing. Compared with thermal annealing, solvent annealing induces increased crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, and the active layer exhibits a more suitable level of phase separation. Besides, the active layer morphology after solvent annealing and post-annealing is similar to that after solvent annealing. Moreover, in contrast to binary films, the presence of P3BT enhances the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in ternary films. However, the ternary OSC devices with 10 wt% P3HT and 10 wt% P3OT show poorer performances as compared with binary OSC devices.

The p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM films tend to form crystals or large aggregates. After incorporating the same weight ratios of P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT into p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 or PC71BM, both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization and PC71BM aggregation are inhibited. The inhibition is more significant and the phase separation decreases as the polymer side chain length is reduced. In the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film, the two components are well mixed, showing minimal phase separation. When 10 wt% P3BT was incorporated into the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system, crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was promoted. After incorporation of 10 wt% P3HT, the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was inhibited. This effect is increased after addition of 10 wt% P3OT, and the phase separation increased on addition of a polymer with longer alkyl side chains. In the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P3OT:PC71BM film, excessive phase separation eventually led to larger PC71BM aggregates.

Many researchers have conducted extensive studies on the influence of the third component on active layer morphology. It was previously revealed that surface energy plays a decisive role in the segregation tendency of each material employed in blends. This tendency has a significant impact on phase separation as well as sensitizer location in ternary blends. The surface energy of materials can be calculated by contact angle measurements, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI). The three polymers, P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT, exhibit similar surface energies (Table S3, ESI); thus, surface energy might not be the main reason for ternary active layer morphology formation. Besides, the location of the third component in the active layer also determines the active layer morphology. As shown in Table S3 (ESI), the location of P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT in ternary blends can be estimated using the wetting coefficient. The calculated values for P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT are between 2.24 and 3.02, indicating that the three polymers are likely to be embedded in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, which could explain the inhibition of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization by the polymers. However, this conflicts with the fact that P3BT could promote crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in ternary blends. The details of the calculation are presented in the ESI. Yang et al. found that supramolecular interaction between the third component and fullerene could alter the aggregation state of fullerene. According to previous reports, the presence of supramolecular interactions can be detected by UV-vis spectroscopy. As illustrated, spectra of P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3ATs:PC71BM blends are depicted in Fig. S9 (ESI), together with spectra of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM for comparison. The absorption of the Soret band is not red-shifted and broadened in P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3ATs:PC71BM blends, indicating that there are no supramolecular interactions between P3ATs, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, and PC71BM. And no new bond formation between P3ATs, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, and PC71BM could be observed in Fig. S10 (ESI). Moreover, Renolds et al. believed that PDMS could function as a nucleating agent in the 1-EtHx small molecule system, increasing the nucleation density of 1-EtHx. Thus, its crystal size was reduced and its crystallinity was improved. However, this theory cannot explain why P3BT inhibited the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in P3BT:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 binary blends, or why P3HT and P3OT cannot function as nucleating agents in ternary blends. Moreover, the dissimilar melting enthalpies of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 blends and ternary blends (Fig. 2e and 4b) indicate that P3ATs and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 do not form a mechanical alloy, thus affecting the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2.
From Fig. 2f, it was found that the crystallization peaks of the three mixtures were significantly different when the polymers were blended with PC71BM. The P3BT:PC71BM blends show no crystallization peak. The P3HT:PC71BM blends exhibit a crystallization peak of PC71BM (Tc = 276.6 °C) and a weak crystallization peak of P3HT (Tc = 156.3 °C). The P3OT:PC71BM blends present an obvious crystallization peak of PC71BM (Tc = 272.0 °C) and a weak crystallization peak of P3OT (Tc = 129.7 °C). This may be due to differences in interactions between the three polymers and PC71BM. In order to understand whether differences in chemical interactions lead to morphology evolution of the ternary active layer, we used DSC to determine χ by measuring the melting point depression of mixtures. This interaction parameter is commonly used to evaluate the compatibility of organic components or diluted solutions. It is calculated according to:
(1)
where subscript 1 identifies with the weaker crystalline material and 2 with the stronger crystalline material.
Tm and T0m are the melting points of the mixture and the pure stronger crystalline material. R is the ideal gas constant, ΔHf is the heat fusion of the stronger crystalline material, v is the molar volume, m is the degree of polymerization, and Φ is the volume fraction. Utilizing χ = Bv1/RT (by neglecting the effects of entropy and Φ2, where B is the interaction energy density characteristic of the polymer pair) substitution into eqn (1), the data can be represented as shown in Fig. 7, and χ can be extracted by a linear fit. The DSC curves for blends with different ratios are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI), and the detailed calculation can be found in the ESI.

In Fig. 7a–c, the excellent fit indicates that χ has a negligible entropic component or ratio dependence. As shown in Fig. 7d, the χ between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM shows the lowest value of 0.50. The low χ indicates strong attractive interactions; thus, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM can form a miscible and thermodynamically stable mixture, which leads to the formation of a uniform p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film and a very low Rq value as well as minimal phase separation. The χ of P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3ATs:PC71BM gradually increases with the polymer side chain length. This indicates that the polymer alkyl side chain affects its compatibility with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM. The longer the alkyl side chain, the poorer the compatibility in P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3ATs:PC71BM systems. A χ value between 0.5 and 1 indicates that P3ATs and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 are partially compatible, and the attractive interactions lead to a reduction in the number of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystals changing into amorphous molecules upon mixing with P3ATs. Similarly, the aggregation of PC71BM is destroyed by P3ATs. The shorter polymer side chain may inhibit crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and aggregation of PC71BM to a greater extent. Besides, the larger χ value results in greater hindrance to polymers approaching p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 or PC71BM, increasing the phase separation of P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3ATs:PC71BM. In addition, the χ between P3ATs and PC71BM is larger than that between P3ATs and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, which is consistent with the theory that the predicted position of P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT is more likely to approach p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 according to Table S3 (ESI). The χ values are 1.19 and 1.37 for P3HT:PC71BM and P3OT:PC71BM, respectively. The poor compatibility led to the emergence of two crystalline peaks when P3HT and P3OT were mixed with PC71BM (see Fig. 2f), even when there were many spherical PC71BM aggregates in the P3OT:PC71BM film (see Fig. 3).
The Flory–Huggins interaction parameters effectively explain the morphology evolution from single component to binary blends, although the situation becomes complicated for ternary blend films. As depicted in Fig. 8, the low χ value indicates excellent compatibility between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM, so the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules and PC71BM molecules are homogeneously mixed, restricting the formation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystals and PC71BM aggregates. The χ values for P3BT:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3BT:PC71BM are close to that of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM. When a small amount of P3BT is added to p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM, the P3BT molecules may be close to the mixed regions of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM, and a few p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules around the PC71BM molecules would be replaced by P3BT molecules, then more amorphous p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules tend to aggregate and form ordered crystals. So P3BT can enhance the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the scale of phase separation is slightly increased, with an improved device performance. However, when a small amount of P3HT or P3OT is added, due to poor compatibility in P3HT:PC71BM and P3OT:PC71BM, it is difficult for the P3HT or P3OT molecules to approach the mixed areas of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM. The P3HT molecules are more inclined to approach the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 phase regions and inhibit the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Meanwhile, due to the poorer compatibility between P3HT and PC71BM, the polymer tends to avoid PC71BM phase regions, leading to larger phase separation between donor and acceptor regions. Therefore, the P3HT and P3OT inhibit the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, while the scale of phase separation is further increased. Moreover, the poorer compatibility between P3OT and PC71BM induces the PC71BM molecules to avoid donor regions and form large aggregates. This is why P3BT can optimize the morphology of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM and improve the device performance while P3HT and P3OT cannot.

In summary, P3BT, P3HT, and P3OT with different alkyl chain lengths were incorporated into the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM system to investigate the morphology evolution from single component to binary blend films and from binary to ternary blend films. It was found that the compatibility between components played a vital role in determining the final morphology formation. In binary blends, polymers with longer side chains led to poorer compatibility in P3ATs:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3ATs:PC71BM; thus, the polymers inhibited the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and aggregation of PC71BM became weaker; meanwhile, phase separation increased. In ternary blends, the polymers had different effects on the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and aggregation of PC71BM. Incorporating P3BT into p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM could promote crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and optimize the morphology, due to the χ value in P3BT:p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P3BT:PC71BM being close to that in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM. However, the poorer compatibility of P3HT and P3OT with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM deteriorates the morphology of the active layer. The relationship between ternary active layer morphology and device performance has been established. Due to the optimized morphology, the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P3BT:PC71BM ternary OSCs achieved a maximum PCE of 3.4% at 10 wt% P3BT without treatment as compared with a PCE of 2.0% for binary OSCs. By further solvent annealing and post-annealing treatment, the PCE reached a maximum of 7.3%. This is the first time that the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters between different components have been calculated and that the mechanism of morphology formation in the ternary active layer has been interpreted. The research results in this article could help to predict the final morphology of ternary blends in organic solar cells through calculating χ values.
