The existence of various detrimental defects inside the absorber layer is a major obstacle limiting the performance of kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells. Cationic substitution is a viable strategy for overcoming this challenge and has drawn tremendous research attention. In this work, a dual-cation substituted CZTSSe involving Ag and Ti to separately occupy partial Cu and Sn lattice sites is proposed. Under 6% Ag and 1% Ti dual-cation substitution, the champion CZTSSe device delivers a highly interesting efficiency of 12.73%, accompanied by an outstanding VOC of 530 mV. Further investigation demonstrates that Ag introduction can improve the density and crystallinity of CZTSSe thin films while decreasing the concentration of CuZn acceptor defects. Further Ti substitution can effectively eliminate fine grains and reduce the defect density of CuSn and [2CuZn + SnZn] defects, as well as the core level defects. This work explores the synergistic effect of Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution in CZTSSe solar cells for the first time, and the clarified device performance improvement mechanism opens up promising possibilities for the bright development of CZTSSe thin-film photovoltaic technology.

Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) is emerging as a promising candidate for thin-film photovoltaic applications owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties, including a suitable bandgap (1.0–1.5 eV, depending on the sulfur to selenium ratio), high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1), and eco-friendly composition. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit, the theoretical efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells is over 30%. However, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CZTSSe solar cells has stagnated at 12.6% for many years, and only exceeded 13% recently. The well-known bottleneck to enhancing the device performance of CZTSSe solar cells consists of a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and low fill factor (FF). For the kesterite structured CZTSSe system, the main reasons accounting for the severe VOC deficit (VOC,def) include the band tail states generated by the high concentration of deep-level defects and defect clusters (e.g., CuZn, CuSn, and [2CuZn + SnZn]), the formation of secondary phases (e.g., CuS, SnS2 and ZnS) during the crystal growth process, and the mismatching energy band alignments between various functional layers. Several approaches have been attempted to mitigate these issues, including cationic substitution, grain growth optimization, heterojunction post-annealing, graded bandgap engineering, and so on.

An effective strategy to suppress the formation of deep-level defects in the CZTSSe lattice is to perform cationic substitution, such as substituting Ag/Li for Cu, Mn/Cd for Zn, and Ga for Sn. Ag substitution is a common strategy to reduce CuZn (copper on zinc antisite) defects in bulk CZTSSe. The similar cationic sizes of Cu and Zn are an important cause of CuZn antisite defects and the band tailing. Substitution of Cu by larger ionic Ag reduces Cu–Zn disorder and improves device VOC. The CZTSSe device with a record PCE of 13.5% was recently prepared by incorporating Ag into the absorber layer. Based on the favourable effect of Ag substitution, adding another element to obtain efficient dual-substitution for CZTSSe has drawn more research attention. For instance, Ag & Li, Ag & Ge, Ag & Mn, Ag & K and Ag & Cd dual-substitutions were introduced to increase the grain size, reduce the defect density, accelerate the charge separation at the interface, suppress the non-radiative recombination loss, and modify the defect characteristics, respectively. This really demonstrates that Ag-involved dual-substitution in CZTSSe is a promising scheme. Despite these endeavors, nonradiative recombination caused by other detrimental deep-level defects (e.g., Sn-related defects of CuSn and [2CuZn + SnZn]) still fundamentally limited the device performance. The large carrier capture area of these defects may instigate recombination centers, thus reducing carrier lifetime and limiting the VOC and FF of the device. To suppress Sn-related defects in CZTSSe thin films, Yuan-Cai Gong et al. proposed that a low Sn content is beneficial to reduce deep-level CuSn defects and constrain the formation of the Sn(S,Se)2 secondary phase. Ya-Chao Du et al. demonstrated that the occupation of Zn and Sn sites by Ga3+ ions could result in inhibited [2CuZn + SnZn] defects and reduced band tailing. Furthermore, Robert B. Wexler et al. eliminated the formation of [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters by completely replacing Sn with Ge. In parallel, Seniha Adiguzel et al. prepared a Cu2ZnTiSe4 kesterite structured semiconductor by completely replacing Sn with Ti, providing a new isoelectronic substitution scenario for Sn. Compared with Ga and Ge, Ti possesses advantages of earth-abundant nature and valence state tolerance regarding Sn substitution. Though the current Cu2ZnTiSe4 device performance is inferior to that of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 or Cu2ZnGeSe4 due to its unstable chemical potential region and worse absorbing film quality, its absorption coefficient is twice that of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, and it has excellent photoelectric performance. Therefore, it is expected that Sn-related detrimental defects, including CuSn antisites and [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters can be suppressed, and superior light absorption can be established by partially replacing Sn with Ti in the CZTSSe absorber layer.
This study demonstrates the beneficial effect of Ag and Ti substitution in the CZTSSe absorber layer. By introducing Ag, the crystallinity of the thin films is greatly optimized, the compactness of the thin films is increased, and the defect density of CuZn is significantly reduced. The addition of a small amount of Ti can further improve the quality of the thin films and inhibit the formation of CuSn antisite defects and [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters. For the first time, we were able to achieve high-efficiency CZTSSe-based solar cells by a simultaneous Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution. The best performing device exhibited lower deep-level defect density (<1012 cm−3) and alleviated VOC,def (0.560 eV), leading to a remarkable increase of PCE from 10.40% to 12.73%. This work will attract more discussions to better understand the role of various substituted cations in modifying CZTSSe, and its photovoltaic performance.

The S-Ref precursor solution was prepared by dissolving cuprous chloride (CuCl, ≥99.5%, Macklin), zinc acetate dihydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2H2O, 99.995%, Aladdin), stannic chloride hydrate (SnCl4·5H2O, 99.995%), and thiourea (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in 2-methoxyethanol (Aladdin), respectively. The concentration ratios of Zn/Sn and Cu/(Zn + Sn) were 1.2 and 0.85 respectively. The Ag solution was prepared by dissolving AgCl powder (99.9%, Aladdin) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and thiourea solution. To prepare the Ti solution, TiCl4 solution (99.9%, Aladdin) was slowly added into ethanol with a 1:9 ratio and shaken for 1 minute. Finally, the S-Ag solution was obtained by uniformly mixing Ag and S-Ref solution. The S-AgTi solution was obtained by uniformly mixing Ti and S-Ag solution. All solutions were stirred at 60 °C for 1 hour and purified through a filter. The as-prepared precursor solution was spun coated 10 times on the Mo-coated soda lime glass (SLG) substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s, followed by heat treatment at 295 °C for 1 min on a hot plate in air. Then the precursor films were selenized with selenium pellets (99.999%, Aladdin) in a graphite square box, and put into a rapid thermal furnace, which was heated to 555 °C with a ramping rate of approximately 4 °C s−1; after 15 min dwell time, the samples cooled down naturally to obtain CZTSSe-based thin films.


To construct solar cells, a cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer with a 50–60 nm thickness was deposited on the Mo/CZTSSe film via a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method, followed by deposition of a 400 nm indium substituted tin oxide (ITO) film as a window layer by the magnetron sputtering method. Finally, a silver (Ag) top grid was deposited by thermal evaporation. The CZTSSe-based thin-film solar cells with the Ag/ITO/CdS/CZTSSe/Mo/glass structure were fabricated, and the active area was fixed at 0.135 cm2. The whole fabrication process and the final device are presented in Fig. 1.


XRD patterns of the CZTSSe-based thin films were recorded using a RigakuUltima IV diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source. Raman spectra were collected using a RenishawinVia spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Zeiss SUPRA 55 system. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NT-MDT instrument under semi-contact mode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using a Thermo Fischer Xi+ system.


Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) of CZTSSe-based devices was performed by Time-of-Flight PHI nanoTOF II SIMS in high mass resolution mode at 30 keV Bi3++ ion. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 microscope. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) characterization was performed on the devices using a FluoTime 300 spectrograph with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Dark and illuminated J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 and a Zolix SS150 solar simulator calibrated under standard test conditions (AM1.5 G). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a Zolix solar cell EQE/IPCE measurement system. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots were used to characterize the carrier transport properties of the device using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The capacitance–voltage profile (C–V) and driver-level capacitance profile (DLCP) were obtained using a Keithley 4200A-SCS system, and admittance spectroscopy (AS) spectra were obtained on the same system with the JANIS cryogenic platform. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) was performed using a FT1030 HERA-DLTS system.


To acquire the optimal Ag substitution ratio in the CZTSSe absorber layer, various Ag-substituted devices with different concentrations were first constructed. Then, the additional Ti substitution ratio was explored on Ag-based devices to obtain dual-cation substituted CZTSSe thin-film solar cells with the best PCE. Fig. S1 (ESI) shows the photovoltaic performance of the Ag-CZTSSe substrate structured devices with Ag/(Cu + Ag) ratios of 0%, 3%, 6%, 9% and 12%, respectively. The Ag-substituted device exhibited a highest PCE (11.35%) under 6% Ag content. This can be attributed to the optimization of cation disorder and the reduction of deep-level defect density in CZTSSe thin films by appropriate Ag substitution, which has also been mentioned in previous publications. Moreover, the Ti single cation substitution can improve the thin film morphology in terms of compactness and grain size (Fig. S2, ESI), and the 1.0% Ti-substituted CZTSSe solar cell presented the best PCE with higher VOC and FF (Fig. S3, ESI). Afterwards, the optimized Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution strategy was further performed with variable Ti/(Sn + Ti) ratios of 0%, 1%, 2%, and 3% with a fixed Ag content of 6%. The statistical distributions of the photovoltaic performance characteristics for dual-cation substituted CZTSSe solar cells are summarized in Fig. S4 (ESI). The evaluation revealed that the device performance increased the most when the Ti content was 1%. Notably, the PCE increased up to 12.73% by simultaneous substitution of Ag and Ti in the CZTSSe absorber layer.

The effects of single-cation substitution (Ag) and dual-cation substitution (Ag and Ti) on CZTSSe thin films and associated devices at optimal contents were systematically investigated. For the sake of comparison, the pristine CZTSSe, 6%Ag-substituted, and 6%Ag + 1%Ti dual-substituted CZTSSe samples are labeled as S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the statistical distributions of the photovoltaic performance characteristics, including VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC), FF and PCE. Each parameter was measured with ten synchronously fabricated cells, showing satisfactory reproducibility. Moreover, the key parameters presented a first increase by single Ag cation substitution and then a further increase under Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution.

Fig. 3 and Table 1 show particular performance parameters for the optimal devices. The device with dual-cation substitution achieved a champion efficiency of 12.73% with a VOC of 530.3 mV, JSC of 37.49 mA·cm−2 and FF of 64.04%. In contrast, the reference device delivered a PCE of 10.40% with a VOC of 478.2 mV, JSC of 36.29 mA·cm−2 and FF of 59.91%. Moreover, the PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF of Ag-substituted devices are 11.35%, 493.6 mV, 37.95 mA·cm−2, and 62.51%, respectively. As listed in Table 1, the substitution of Ag has a strong influence on VOC and JSC, while the Ti mainly affects the VOC. Table 2 shows a further comparison with the previously reported single-cation substituted and dual-cation co-substituted CZTSSe-based thin-film solar cells. It is worth mentioning that this S-AgTi device efficiency (12.73%) is comparable to the current record value of 13.5% for Ag-substituted CZTSSe, also representing the highest value for dual-cation substituted CZTSSe devices. Moreover, a lower VOC,def of 0.560 V and a higher VOC/VSQOC of 62.43% can be achieved, where VSQOC (VSQOC = 0.932 × Eg − 0.1667) is the maximum achievable VOC associated with the Shockley–Queisser limit, indicating its satisfactory device efficiency.

EQE spectra of the CZTSSe-based devices are shown in Fig. 3b. Over the primary wavelength range (i.e., from 500 to 1300 nm), the S-AgTi device exhibited a better photoelectric response than S-Ref and S-Ag devices, which is closely related to an improved light absorption with Ti substitution regarding a two-fold light absorption coefficient for Cu2ZnTiSe4. More interestingly, the EQE intensity exceeding 90% can be observed in the wavelength range from 555 to 790 nm for the S-AgTi device, indicating that most of the loss caused by the conversion of incident photons into carriers has been overcome, thus improving the charge carrier collection capability and efficiency. However, for S-AgTi, a slightly lower EQE in the short wavelength region also indicates some interface recombination issues associated with the front interface and buffer layers, which needs to be optimized in the future. The integrated JSC values calculated from EQE data are 32.81, 34.00, and 35.36 mA·cm−2, indicating a synchronous increase of JSC under appropriate cation substitution. Afterwards, the bandgap (Eg) of the CZTSSe absorber is determined by plotting (E × ln(1 − EQE))2versus energy (Fig. 3c), where the Eg values of S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi devices are 1.11, 1.10 and 1.09, respectively. Such a slight bandgap narrowing can be ascribed to the cooperation of the Burstein–Moss shift and the renormalization effect under ion substitution. Fig. 3d demonstrates the Urbach tail model to characterize the variation in the band tail states. The Urbach energy (EU) value of the device is obtained by the reciprocal of the slope of the curve of ln(−ln(1 − EQE)) versus energy plots. The EU values are 25.3, 23.4, and 22.6 meV for S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi devices, respectively. The lowest EU for S-AgTi indicates a positive reduction in the band tail effect. According to the first-principles calculation, the deep Urbach tails are normally related to bandgap narrowing induced by (2III + IVII) defect clusters, e.g., the lower [2CuZn + SnZn] defect cluster concentration might be an important factor in this case. Thus, by preventing the extreme tailing state, a lower EU is obtained, which shows that the dual-cation substitution of Ag and Ti can mitigate the VOC loss.
The junction-dependent electrical behaviours of CZTSSe-based devices were further analysed by dark J–V measurements. Both devices have evident rectifying features, as illustrated in Fig. S5a (ESI). The general single exponential diode equation is as follows
(1)
where
J0 is the reverse saturation current density, q is the elementary charge, A is the diode ideality factor, R is the series resistance, G is the shunt conductance and JL is the light current density. Fig. S5b presents the plots of dJ/dV against V, where the G values can be obtained by reading from the flat regions under reverse bias, and thus the G values of S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi devices are 0.5, 0.25 and 0.3 mS·cm−2, respectively. The diode ideality factor A was obtained by plotting dV/dJ against (J + JSC)−1 to the slope (Fig. 3e). Upon linear fitting, a much favorable ideality factor was witnessed for the S-AgTi device than for the other two types of devices. A higher A value for S-Ref and S-Ag devices may be assigned to higher defect concentrations on the CZTSSe absorber surface. In contrast, the S-AgTi device presented a better p–n junction quality and heterojunction interface, indicating suppressed interface and space charge region (SCR) recombination. The reverse saturation current density J0 was deduced from the y-intercept by plotting ln(J + JSC − GV) against V–RJ (Fig. 3f), which was 1.5 × 10−2, 7.3 × 10−4, and 1.3 × 10−4 mA·cm−2 for S-Ref, S-Ag and S-AgTi devices, respectively. A smaller J0 indicates better unilateral conductivity of the diode and is closer to the ideal transistor. Thus, a lower J0 and better A factor confirmed relatively low nonradiative recombination in the S-AgTi device, which thereby facilitated the enhancement of VOC and FF. Overall, the upgraded absorber layer quality and junction quality under Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution is validated by the suitable bandgap, band tail state, and diode performance, and the corresponding key parameters are summarized in Table 1.

Systematic structural and morphological characterization studies were performed on the representative S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi thin films to obtain the possible single- and/or dual-cation substitution mechanism. Fig. 4a illustrates the XRD patterns of the thin films. The major diffraction peaks match well with the (112), (204), and (312) planes of the orthorhombic phase of CZTSSe without detectable impurities or secondary phases. The XRD peaks possess strong and sharp features, where the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the representative (112) plane is 0.330, 0.311, and 0.309 for S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi thin films, respectively. The FWHM value dropped gradually after Ag and Ag/Ti were substituted into CZTSSe, indicating an improved crystallinity and grain size. The XRD peak value deviates to the left usually pointing to a small angle deviation, representing lattice distortion with an enlarged lattice constant, indicating that the radius of the substituted atom is larger than that of the host atom (i.e., rAg+ > rCu+). However, after dual-cation substitution, the XRD peak slightly shifts to the right, which is due to the smaller radius of the Ti4+ ion as compared to that of Sn4+. As the substituting concentration of Ti is relatively lower, there is still a left offset trend for the S-AgTi thin films. Fig. 4b displays the Raman spectra of the S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi thin films. All the marked vibrations in the Raman spectra (at 174.6, 197.5, and 236 cm−1) are the characteristic modes of kesterite CZTSSe. The variation of modal intensities can reflect the variation of the most dominant charge compensated defect cluster in CZTSSe. The Raman peak at 236 cm−1 becomes lower with Ag, Ti dual-substitution, indicating suppressed [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters. The occurrence of this phenomenon may be ascribed to the decrease in the chemical potential of Sn, where Sn was partially substituted by Ti. XRD and Raman studies reveal that Ag and Ti can enter the CZTSSe lattice and prevent the production of deep-level detrimental defects via separately occupying Cu and Sn sites. XPS measurements were used to identify the valence states of Ag and Ti in CZTSSe-based thin films, as shown in Fig. 4c–h. There is no noticeable peak shifting for Cu2p, Zn2p, or S2p peaks upon cationic substitution. The valence states of Cu (+1), Zn (+2), and S (−2) were obtained from the peak positions and energy differences of Cu2p, Zn2p, and S2p peaks respectively. As expected, the typical Ag 3d peaks of the S-Ag and S-AgTi thin films appear at 366.9 eV (3d5/2) and 372.9 eV (3d3/2), confirming that Ag ions are incorporated into the CAZTSSe lattice and the valence state of Ag is +1. According to high-resolution Ti2p spectra (Fig. 4d) for S-AgTi thin films, obvious Ti2p peaks emerged at 457.8 eV (2p1/2) and 463.6 eV (2p3/2) with a specific separation binding energy value of 5.8 eV and a valence state of +4. Moreover, it is found that the XPS peak of Sn changed greatly after Ti substitution. The deconvolution of Sn3d peaks includes three features according to the curve-fitting procedure (Fig. 4g). To be specific, the binding energy peaks at 485.0 ± 0.1 eV, 487.0 ± 0.1 eV, and 497.0 ± 0.1 eV can be assigned to Sn2+, Sn4+ and Zn-Auger peak L3M45M45, respectively. Notably, the Sn3d peak of S-AgTi is offset to a lower binding energy than the thin films without Ti substitution. The corresponding XPS peak fitting results are summarized and shown in Table S1 (ESI). It's worth noting that Ag and Ti substitutions can both diminish the intensity of the Zn L3M45M45 Auger peak to some extent, and this Auger peak is closely related to the presence of the Zn-based secondary phase or Zn-related defects. In particular, the intensity of the Sn4+ peak in S-AgTi decreases by more than half owing to an obvious Sn4+ substitution by Ti4+ in the lattice. As a result, Ti substitution reduces SnZn levels in the grain growth process, as well as defect clusters of [CuZn + SnZn] and [2CuZn + SnZn].
The morphologies of the CZTSSe-based thin films were characterized by SEM and AFM as shown in Fig. 5. Obviously, the presence of pinholes on the surface of S-Ref thin films might hinder the preferential flow of charges, and thus adversely affects the device performance. Ag substitution leads to a more compact crystalline thin film accompanied by an average grain size of approximately 1 μm, which is beneficial to inhibit the recombination loss at the grain boundaries. Furthermore, the thin film surface tends to be more flat and smooth after additional Ti substitution (Fig. 5(a3)). As shown in Fig. 5(b1)–(b3) a double-layer structure composed of fine grains at the bottom part and comparatively larger grains near the top surface can be observed in the S-Ref and S-Ag thin films. The loose arrangement of fine grains will increase the resistivity throughout the absorber layer, which will also limit the device performance due to severe charge recombination triggered by the numerous grain boundaries that photo-generated carriers must encounter. Ag substitution can greatly increase the thickness of the large grain layer due to the crystal growth promotion, though the double-layer structure still exists. According to the cross-sectional SEM image of S-AgTi, a gradual variation from small to large grains from the bottom to the top can also be observed. However, the number of small grains significantly decreases, accompanied by the disappearance of a double-layer phenomenon, confirming a positive effect of crystal growth under Ti substitution. A much superior back contact between the S-AgTi absorber and Mo substrate can also be achieved under this scenario. Fig. 5(c1)–(c3) show 2D and 3D images and roughness histograms of S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi thin films obtained through AFM measurements, respectively. S-Ag have fewer surface voids than S-Ref, which is consistent with SEM data. Moreover, the average roughness of S-Ag and S-AgTi is 65.149 and 60.162 nm, which is beneficial to obtain an efficient CZTSSe absorber surface and CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction interface with passivated defects and mitigated current leakage.

Fig. 6 shows the TEM and SIMS characterization results of the champion dual-cation substituted S-AgTi thin-film device. The surface to interior region, with interplanar d-spacings of about 0.322 nm and 0.211 nm, corresponds to the distance belonging to the (112) and (204) lattice planes of the orthorhombic phase CZTSSe, respectively. In general, the intensity of atomic columns acquired from the high-angle annular dark field STEM (HAADF-STEM) signal is proportional to the mean square atomic number (Z2) of the CZTSSe absorber layer, which shows very similar lattice fringes from the constituent atoms. Thus, the intensity profile (Fig. 6b) associated with the marked blue rectangle area (Fig. 6a) can provide distribution of essential elements. Normally, one bright spot can be observed for every eight atoms since the value of Z(Sn)2 is more than twice the values of other elements (Cu, Zn, S, Se, Ag, or Ti). However, an irregular peak with half the intensity appears at the location where the Sn signal should have been detected, implying a localized cation substitution by an element with a smaller Z number. Combining the aforementioned XRD and XPS analyses, it can be confirmed that Sn (Z = 50) is partially substituted by Ti (Z = 22) inside the CZTSSe lattice, which might further influence the Sn-related deep-level bulk defects (e.g., CuSn and SnZn antisite defects and defect clusters). The peak intensity increase caused by substituting Ag for Cu is also found in the intensity profile, strengthening that Ag cations enter the CZTSSe lattice and optimize cationic disorder. Finally, SIMS was performed to further investigate the elemental distribution of CZTSSe under Ag, Ti dual-substitution (Fig. 6c). Obviously, Ag and Ti have a comparable depth distribution to Cu, Sn, and Se, which are uniformly distributed across the absorber layer. As a supplementary explanation, the relatively lower SIMS intensity of Zn is possibly caused by its low SIMS ion yield, and the TEM-coupled elemental mapping reveals its reasonable concentration and distribution (Fig. S6, ESI).
In previous sections, the structural, compositional and morphological characterization supported the enhanced device performance upon Ag single-cation and Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution in CZTSSe, but it did not affirm their actual role. The type and density of defects in CZTSSe-based devices were measured by AS. The AS spectra of S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi taken from 103 to 106 Hz in the temperature range of 120–300 K are depicted in Fig. 7, and the frequency corresponding to the defect energy level can be obtained by using the equation
(2)
where
ω0 is the inflection point frequency, Ea is the defect energy level, v0 is the emission factor and T is the temperature. According to the first-principles calculations and experimental reports, the obtained defect activation energies Ea of 94.65 meV for S-Ref and Ea of 84.0 meV for S-Ag are all associated with the CuZn defects. However, the Ea of 60.50 meV for S-AgTi should be ascribed to VCu (copper vacancies) defects. The CuZn and VCu defects with lower activation energy determine the p-type conductivity in the CZTSSe absorber. Both S-Ref and S-Ag devices contained CuZn acceptor defects, and the calculated defect densities Nt were 3.40 × 1015 and 1.43 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Hence, the concentration of CuZn defects can be effectively reduced by substituting Cu with Ag, which is consistent with previously reported work in the literature. The reduction of CuZn defects can suppress the nonradiative recombination loss in CZTSSe, and improve the VOC and FF of the device. Furthermore, under Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution, CuZn antisite defects disappeared and transformed to more shallow-level defects of VCu with a defect density Nt of 1.89 × 1015 cm−1. Such evolution was closely related to Ti substitution induced growth promotion, which reduced the fine grains and grain boundaries in the absorber layer, thus alleviating the lattice disorder sites for CuZn defects with lower formation energy. The reduction of the defect level would also increase the carrier emission rate and decrease the recombination rate, and therefore reduce the bulk recombination loss of the photo-generated carriers.

TRPL with a 1064 nm-wavelength laser was used to study the effect of cationic substitution on charge carrier recombination mechanisms. A two-exponential function model was used to fit the TRPL decay curves of the S-Ref, S-Ag and S-AgTi thin films (Fig. 8a), according to the exponential fitting formula
(3)
where
τ is the minority carrier lifetime, A1 and A2 are coefficients, and τ1 and τ2 are the components of τ. The fitted τ of S-Ref is 0.8 ns, while the values increased to 1.18 and 1.37 ns for S-Ag and S-AgTi devices, respectively. The longer PL decay time indicates a reduced recombination rate, thus enabling more efficient photo-generated carrier collection. To interpret the effect of cationic substitution on bulk and interface defects, C–V and DLCP analyses were first performed on S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi devices (Fig. 8b). In general, the DLCP signal contains deep defect and free carrier responses, whereas the difference between C–V and DLCP reveals interface flaws. The NC–V and NDLCP can be expressed according to the equations

where
ND is the doping density of CdS, AD is the device area, x is the profiling depth, and ε0, εr,n, and εr,p represent the permittivity of free space and the relative permittivity of CdS and CZTSSe, respectively; C0 and C1 are two quadratic fitting parameters derived from the C–V curves. Table 3 summarises the data obtained from C–V and DLCP measurements. For S-Ref and S-Ag devices, the interfacial defect density (Ni) reduced from 2.52 × 1015 to 1.94 × 1015 cm−3, signifying an optimized CZTSSe surface topography and improved heterojunction interface quality upon Ag substitution. Then the Ni value (1.67 × 1015 cm−3) was further reduced after Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution, consistent with the SEM and AFM results. The decline of interfacial defects is supportive to suppress nonradiative recombination losses and obtain high-efficiency solar cells. Simultaneously, Ag and Ti dual-cation substitution also greatly passivated the defect density in the absorber layer. The NDLCP (including free carriers and bulk defects) decreased from 1.02 × 1016 to 2.59 × 1015 cm−3. Moreover, the width of the depletion layer (Wd) is an important parameter for light absorbing materials with relatively short diffusion lengths of minority carriers. An efficient thin-film solar cell usually requires a sufficient width for the separation of photo-generated carriers in the depletion layer. In this case, the Wd value interestingly increased from 141 to 254 nm after dual-cation substitution, which is beneficial for the light absorption and carrier extraction. The enhanced interface charge transport and mitigated interface charge recombination via this dual-cation substitution were also verified by EIS analysis (Fig. S7, ESI). The equivalent circuit fitting data (inset in Fig. S7) demonstrated a minimum series resistance (R0 of 15.14 Ω) and a maximum recombination resistance (R1 of 37311 Ω) for the S-AgTi device, benefitting the charge transport and device performance.

Finally, in order to understand the deep-level defect properties of bulk CZTSSe, especially under these effective cationic substitutions, DLTS data were obtained. Fig. 8c illustrates the DLTS signals under reverse bias (VR = 0.35 V) for S-Ref, S-Ag, and S-AgTi devices, and the pulse voltage and pulse width were −0.30 V and 10 ms. Two broad peaks are traced for all the devices, which can be used to obtain the defect information. And the negative peak is assigned to donor defects (E1), whereas the positive one is assigned to acceptor defects (H1). The Arrhenius plots of the two devices are presented in Fig. 8d, from which the activation energy (EA) of the defects and their integrated density (NT) are extracted (Table 4). The defect level with an EA of 0.210 and 0.275 eV can be assigned to CuSn antisite acceptor defects, while an EA of 0.290 and 0.321 eV corresponds to [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters.Fig. 8e shows the positions of Fermi levels (EF) and defect levels in the energy bands of S-Ref and S-AgTi absorbers, where EF was obtained from UPS data (Fig. S8, ESI). Obviously, for the two harmful deep-level defects, both the activation energy and defect density of the S-AgTi device are lower than those of the S-Ref device. According to the following formula of the emission rate of carriers (ep)

where
σn is the carrier capture cross-section, vth is the mean thermal velocity, and Nc is the effective density of state. S-AgTi presented a relatively faster emission, thus reducing carrier recombination. For the CuSn antisite acceptor defects, the NT of the S-AgTi device (6.9 × 1011 cm−3) is only half of that of the S-Ag device (1.2 × 1012 cm−3). This is due to the substitution of Ti for Sn in the S-AgTi device to avoid the production of CuSn acceptor defects. Likewise, the concentration of [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters shrank from 5.7 × 1012 to 9.6 × 1011 cm−3 after substitution. The presence of high population CuSn and [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters within the CZTSSe bulk could act as trap and/or recombination centers that degraded the device performance. Overall, the Ti substitution optimizes the distribution of the Sn valence state, leading to reduced concentrations of CuSn and [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters, which is beneficial to alleviate the serious band tail effect and bulk recombination, thus enhancing the VOC of the CZTSSe photovoltaic device.

In conclusion, Ag and Ti cations were introduced by adding AgCl and TiCl4 solution into the CZTS precursor solution. After selenization, Ag, Ti dual-cation-substituted CZTSSe thin films were prepared for the first time. The highest device efficiency of 12.73% can be obtained at Ag and Ti substitution levels of 6% and 1%, respectively, accompanied by a simultaneous increase of VOC, JSC, and FF, especially an outstanding VOC of 530 mV. A systematic investigation shows that Ag substitution greatly improves the density and crystallinity of CZTSSe thin films and inhibits the generation of leakage current. In addition, cationic disorder is effectively alleviated by replacing Cu with a large size cation of Ag, and the defect of CuZn is greatly reduced. Partial substitution of Sn by Ti is a further collaborative optimization strategy to reduce the detrimental deep-level defects in Ag-substituted CZTSSe. Our in-depth study shows that Ti substitution can effectively reduce the density of CuSn and [2CuZn + SnZn] defects (<1012 cm−3), reduce the defect level, improve the light absorption and enhance charge transport. Overall, the role of Ag, Ti dual-cation substitution in CZTSSe solar cells is discussed for the first time, unwrapping promising possibilities for overcoming intractable issues in the development of CZTSSe-based photovoltaic devices.
