Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are promising tools for indoor light harvesting and power conversion, but high voltage losses, especially under weak illumination, hinder their development. In this work, the organic active material system PM6/IT-4Cl, which is green solvent processible and highly suitable for indoor light harvesting, is employed to investigate the voltage loss mechanism in indoor OPV devices. Three major problems specific to indoor OPV devices are identified, including a high density of pinholes in the active layer leading to low device shunt resistance, a too-large charge transfer energy loss causing high radiative voltage losses, and a high trap concentration in the active layer limiting the device electroluminescence efficiency and open-circuit voltage. To solve these problems, a strategy based on the use of solvents and solid additives is proposed. This resulted in a significant increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the PM6/IT-4Cl devices from 16% to 23% under white LED illumination (3000 K, 4000 lux). Our findings highlight the importance of developing tailored optimization strategies to reduce voltage losses in order to further improve the performance of indoor OPV devices.

Solution-processed donor–acceptor organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have seen rapid improvements in performance due to the development of novel non-fullerene acceptors. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices under simulated AM1.5 illumination has increased to over 20%. Furthermore, OPV devices have been demonstrated to exhibit high efficiency under weak illumination intensities, thereby increasing the potential of this technology to be used as an alternative power source in emerging fields. However, it should be noted that the key factors limiting the performance of OPV devices operating under weak illumination differ from those observed under solar illumination.

In 2011, Steim et al. demonstrated that the issue of a high series resistance in OPV devices has minimal impact on the performance under weak illumination conditions. Conversely, achieving a low shunt current is of crucial importance for achieving highly efficient power conversion under low light conditions. Subsequently, Park et al. reported a bilayer deposition strategy for the organic photoactive layer, which effectively increased the shunt resistance and suppressed the shunt current in OPV devices. This advancement has propelled the utilization of OPV devices for indoor light harvesting.
Furthermore, OPV devices show great potential for harvesting indoor LED lights. This is attributed to the fact that organic absorbers can be designed to closely match the absorption spectrum of indoor LED light sources. In 2018, Yin et al. utilized a wide-gap porphyrin-based donor material mixed with PCBM to fabricate OPV devices for LED light harvesting. The choice of this material system was motivated by its absorption spectrum range (350–800 nm), which aligns well with that of typical white LEDs. As a result, the voltage losses in the OPV devices were low, leading to a high PCE exceeding 19%. Additionally, Cui et al. developed a novel acceptor material, IO-4Cl, which exhibits an absorption spectrum spanning the wavelength range of 300–750 nm. The use of IO-4Cl enabled OPV devices to achieve a significantly higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) compared to silicon devices under LED illumination. Consequently, the PCE of indoor LED OPV devices further increased to 26%.
Another crucial parameter that determines the performance of OPV devices operating under weak illumination intensities is the charge carrier transport property of the devices. While surface recombination losses of charge carriers in OPV devices are generally much lower compared to inorganic devices, the presence of a high density of traps significantly limits the charge carrier transport properties of indoor OPV devices. As a result, the fill factor (FF) of indoor OPV devices is often limited. In addressing this challenge, Zhou et al. proposed a solvent additive strategy using (1-chloronaphthalene) (CN) to modify the morphology of the active layer. This approach successfully reduced the trap density and further enhanced the FF of the OPV devices under weak illumination. With both the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and FF significantly improved, the highest reported PCE for indoor OPV devices now surpassed 30%, making them highly promising for various industrial applications.
The development of methods to process OPV devices using green solvents has further accelerated the industrialization of this technology. Despite this, many donor–acceptor systems with desired absorption spectra are expected to perform poorly under indoor LED illumination due to limited VOC. For instance, the green solvent-processible blend PM6/IT-4Cl has an absorption onset of less than 800 nm, aligning with the spectrum of typical white LED lights. This results in OPV devices based on this blend having a Shockley–Queisser PCE of over 50% with a predicted VOC upper limit of over 1.2 V under LED illumination. However, the actual VOC is much lower, with the value below 0.80 V under AM1.5 illumination, which is further reduced under simulated indoor LED illumination. Additionally, the FF of the PM6/IT-4Cl device is significantly lower than expected, thus limiting the overall photovoltaic performance. To enhance the PCE of OPV devices for indoor LED light harvesting, a deeper understanding of performance loss mechanisms, particularly those affecting VOC and FF under weak LED illumination, is necessary.
In this study, we investigated the performance loss mechanisms of indoor OPV devices using the PM6/IT-4Cl-based donor–acceptor blend processed with a green solvent as a model system. We identified three critical issues that are specifically associated with indoor OPV devices. Subsequently, we proposed a strategy combining a solvent additive with a solid additive to process the photoactive layer, aiming to address these challenges in indoor OPV devices. Finally, we demonstrated that the implementation of this approach led to a significant increase in the PCE of the OPV devices.

To investigate the performance loss mechanisms of OPV devices under low light conditions, we employed PM6/IT-4Cl as the active layer. We chose IT-4Cl as the model acceptor because it belongs to IT-series acceptors, which, have a larger bandgap compared to that of Y-series acceptors, and are more suitable for harvesting white LED lights with an emission edge wavelength shorter than 800 nm. Furthermore, IT-4Cl is green solvent processible and therefore promising for industrial applications. The chemical structures of the active materials are presented in Fig. 1a. The optoelectronic properties of the thin films based on these materials processed using o-xylene, and the spectrum of the LED (3000 K, 4000 lux) used in this work, are illustrated in Fig. 1b and c. Fig. 1b shows that the optical bandgap energy (Eg) of the donor–acceptor blend film is approximately 1.60 eV, corresponding to an absorption edge wavelength of 775 nm. The absorption spectrum of this blend system aligns well with the spectrum of common white LED lights. Thus, as per the Shockley–Queisser theory, which is plotted in Fig. S1a (ESI), VOC of photovoltaic devices based on PM6/IT-4Cl under AM1.5 and indoor LED light (3000 K, 4000 lux) conditions can reach 1.30 and 1.20 V, respectively. These values are significantly higher than the theoretical limit for the VOC value of silicon-based inorganic photovoltaic devices (0.89 and 0.75 V, Fig. S1b, ESI). Furthermore, since the absorption spectrum of the PM6/IT-4Cl system fully covers the emission spectrum of the white LED, the theoretical limit for the short-circuit current density (JSC) of OPV devices based on PM6/IT-4Cl can reach 500 μA cm−2 (3000 K, 4000 lux, Fig. S1c, ESI), which is consistent with the upper limit of the JSC of silicon-based devices (Fig. S1d, ESI). As a result, the upper limit for the PCE of the PM6/IT-4Cl device is predicted to be 50%, while for silicon devices, the PCE limit is 29%. It is noteworthy that silicon-based devices often exhibit significant crystal defects, which can impede the device FF under low light conditions. Therefore, the performance of OPV devices based on PM6/IT-4Cl under indoor LED conditions is expected to be superior to that of silicon-based devices.

To assess the real-world performance of OPV devices using PM6/IT-4Cl processed with o-xylene, we fabricated the devices with the standard architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag. We measured current density–voltage (J–V) curves using different illumination intensities and recorded the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the device, as shown in Fig. 1d and e, respectively. The device exhibited a JSC value of approximately 18.59 mA cm−2 under AM1.5 illumination and the EQE peak was close to 80%, comparable to state-of-the-art OPV devices. This indicates a high internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for the PM6/IT-4Cl device under both AM1.5 and indoor LED illumination conditions. However, the measured VOC value of 0.86 V (Table 1) under AM1.5 illumination is lower than the value predicted by the Shockley–Queissor theory (1.3 V), leading to a limited PCE of about 11%. Similarly, under LED illumination (3000 K, 40000 lux), VOC (0.81 V) is also lower than expected and decreases rapidly with decreasing illumination intensity, indicating high voltage losses and limiting the PCE for LED light to less than 18%.

Systematic characterization of PM6/IT-4Cl photovoltaic devices was conducted to investigate the origin of the low VOC value and high voltage losses. Fig. 2a illustrates the dark J–V characteristics of the device, revealing a very low Rsh value of 105 Ω cm2. This results in a high leakage current, which restricts the photocurrent generated by weak LED light, especially when the device operates at the maximum power point. The leakage current also limits the VOC and FF of the device, which are more severely impacted under weaker illumination intensities. The VOC and FF of the device under strong LED illumination (3000 K, 40000 lux) are 0.81 V and 70.9%, respectively, and decrease to 0.66 V and 64.8%, respectively, as the illumination intensity decreases to 400 lux, as listed in Table 1.
The Rsh value of OPV devices is closely related to the density of pin-holes formed in the organic donor–acceptor active layer. Because the active layer is processed using a spin-coating technique from a solution, pinholes of varying sizes and densities can form during the evaporation of the solvent. The presence of these pinhole defects results in direct contact between the top electrode of the OPV device and the bottom electrode after being deposited on the active layer, creating short circuits and reducing the Rsh value of the device. To confirm that the low Rsh value in PM6/IT-4Cl devices was indeed due to pinhole defects in the active layer, we characterized the active layer coated on a metal film using a reflection microscope. As shown in Fig. 2b, we could indeed observe a high density of pinholes distributed throughout the active layer, with a size of approximately 1 μm. Then, we studied the topographic property of the active layer using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI), pin-holes, represented by the dark spots, were also observed. It should be stressed that this type of pinhole defect is also expected to be present in the active layer of OPV devices designed for harvesting sunlight. However, the Rsh value of 105 Ω cm2 would have only a minor impact on the performance of OPV devices generating a high photocurrent under high illumination conditions. Therefore, this issue of pinhole defects, causing significant performance losses in indoor OPV devices, has not yet received enough attention in the OPV field.
The low VOC observed in organic donor–acceptor photovoltaic devices is certainly not solely caused by the presence of a high leakage current. In the framework of the Marcus theory, the magnitude of VOC in these devices is largely determined by the energy of the CT state (ECT) formed at the donor–acceptor interfaces. More specifically, for a given donor–acceptor system with a fixed optical bandgap (Eg), a reduction in ECT leads to an increase in the energetic driving force for the exciton dissociation (ΔECT = Eg − ECT), resulting in a higher radiative voltage loss (ΔVr). With the aim of gaining a deeper insight into the limiting factors for VOC, we conducted a comprehensive study of the energetic properties of the CT state in the PM6/IT-4Cl active layer. Specifically, we conducted highly sensitive EQE measurements and electroluminescence (EL) measurements for the PM6/IT-4Cl device, as depicted in Fig. 2c. Then, we performed the Gaussian fitting for the tail of the EQE (EQEtail) spectrum, using the expression,
(1)
Where
E is the photon energy, f is a prefactor related to the absorption oscillator strength of CT states and internal quantum efficiency of the device, λ is the reorganization energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. From the fitting, we determined that ECT was approximately 1.44 eV.

Given that the Eg value of the blend active layer was 1.60 eV (as shown in Fig. S3, ESI), we concluded that ΔECT for the PM6/IT-4Cl blend was 0.16 eV. This ΔECT value was relatively larger compared to what has been found in OPV devices designed to efficiently operate under solar illumination (<0.1 eV). Therefore, the large ΔECT, leading to high ΔVr, is another reason behind the low VOC.
For OPV devices harvesting sunlight, a large number of efficient donor and acceptor material combinations exist, resulting in a very small ΔECT value in the device, while still producing avery high photocurrent. On the other hand, for indoor OPV devices, there is a limited variety of materials available, due to the requirement of high Eg for the acceptor, thus, it is difficult to find a highly efficient donor–acceptor combination, which also has a small ΔECT. Therefore, the large ΔECT, limiting the device VOC, is another problem specific to indoor OPV devices.
The VOC of OPV devices is also determined by EQEEL: a lower EQEEL leads to a higher ΔVnr, according to the expression,
(2)
where
q is the elementary charge. Therefore, we evaluated ΔVnr in the PM6/IT-4Cl device by measuring EQEEL. As shown in Fig. 2d, EQEEL, measured with an injection current density close to the JSC of the device under AM1.5 illumination, was found to be very low, about 4 × 10−6, resulting in a ΔVnr value of 0.32 V. Furthermore, EQEEL reduces with the reducing injection current, leading to a further increased ΔVnr. In fact, the ΔVnr value is significantly higher than that reported for high-efficiency outdoor OPV devices (≈0.20 V), adding to the reason for the limited VOC of the PM6/IT-4Cl device.

To investigate the origin of the low EQEEL value, we measured VOC as a function of illumination intensity for the PM6/IT-4Cl device. The results are shown in Fig. 2e. From a linear fit, we discovered that the slope of the curve is 1.4kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Thus, the ideality factor of the device is 1.4, higher than that of efficient outdoor OPV devices (close to 1.0). The ideality factor is a measure for the order of charge carrier recombination in the device, and the presence of trap-assisted recombination increases the ideality factor. Therefore, the higher ideality factor for the PM6/IT-4Cl-based indoor photovoltaic device suggests a higher concentration of traps. We emphasize that for efficient outdoor OPV devices, or even for the PM6/IT-4Cl device under strong illumination, the traps are easily filled up by the high density of charge carriers generated by the high illumination intensity. However, for indoor OPV devices operating under weak illumination, the density of charge carriers in the active layer is low, and the traps could not be filled up. Therefore, the presence of traps is detrimental to both EQEEL and FF of the indoor devices, as it would prompt the loss of charge carriers by non-radiative recombination. This is also the reason for the rapid decrease in FF and VOC values with decreasing illumination intensity (Table 1), for the PM6/IT-4Cl device. Therefore, the traps are identified as a third issue related to the performance limit in the indoor OPV devices, and they are the origin of the low EQEEL value of the PM6/IT-4Cl device.
To quantify the density of traps in the PM6/IT-4Cl device, we constructed a single-carrier (electron only) device based on PM6/IT-4Cl. The device architecture is ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag. From the J–V curve, shown in Fig. 2f, we observe both the space charge limited and the trap-filled regions. The space charge limited region can be fitted using the following equation:
(3)
where
εr is the relative dielectric constant of the PM6/IT-4Cl active layer, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, μ is the electron mobility, and d is the thickness of the active layer. The fitting allowed us to determine the electron mobility, which is about 2.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, as indicated in Fig. 2f. We then performed fitting for the trap-filled region for the determination of the trap density (Nt), using the following equation:

(4)
where
NC is the effective density of states, assumed to be 1020 cm−3, l is a fit parameter related to the ratio between the characteristic temperature of traps and the device operation temperature (300 K). As indicated in Fig. 2f, we find that Nt for the PM6/IT-4Cl-based device is as high as 8.2 × 1018 cm−3, considerably higher than that of high-efficiency outdoor OPV devices (≈1017 cm−3).

The above results indicate that to enhance the performance of the PM6/IT-4Cl device for indoor light harvesting, the pinholes need elimination, ΔECT needs to be reduced, and the trap density must be reduced.

To address the problem of pinholes and the low Rsh value that limits the performance of the OPV device for indoor light harvesting, we optimized the processing conditions used for the device construction. Specifically, we added CN (0.5%, vol%) to the active PM6/IT-4Cl solution because it has a higher boiling point and greater solubility for the active materials compared to the host solvent o-xylene. Furthermore, CN is commonly used as a solvent additive to optimize the morphology of the active layer and improve the performance of OPV devices for outdoor light harvesting, so its use in the construction of the PM6/IT-4Cl device is not expected to cause a reduction in the photovoltaic performance due to deteriorations in the structural, morphological, or molecular packing properties of the active layer.

Reflection microscope measurements for the active layer processed with CN coated on a metal film confirm that the use of CN could indeed reduce the density of pinholes (Fig. 3a). Then, the dark J–V measurements revealed that the reduced density of pinholes in the active layer of PM6/IT-4Cl processed with CN does lead to an improved Rsh value, from 105 to 106 Ω cm2 (Fig. 3b). Accordingly, despite having little impact on the performance of the photovoltaic device under the AM1.5 illumination conditions, the use of CN significantly improved the device performance under weak indoor LED illumination. As listed in Table 1, VOC of the device measured with an LED (3000 K, 40000 lux) is improved from 0.81 to 0.82 V, and FF increased from 70.9% to 73.3% using the CN additive, and thus, the PCE also increased, from 17.18% to 18.59%. When the illumination intensity is further reduced, the improvement in the device performance by the use of CN is more significant: when the intensity of the LED illumination is reduced to 4000 lux, a PCE of 18.36% is realized using the CN additive, while the PCE is only 16.01% for the device processed without CN. The J–V curves of the OPV device processed with CN, measured under different illumination intensities are provided in Fig. 3c.
To evaluate any additional reasons for the improved device performance, we characterized the CT state properties of the PM6/IT-4Cl active layers processed with and without CN. The results, shown in Fig. 3d, indicate that ECT is approximately 1.44 eV for both the active layers processed with and without CN. Hence, the ΔECT value is the same, 0.16 eV. Additionally, EQEEL of the OPV devices based on the active layers processed with and without CN are found to be similar, about 5 × 10−6 (Fig. S4, ESI), resulting in a ΔVnr value of 0.31–0.32 V. These findings confirm that the use of CN has no significant impact on the photo-physical properties of the active material system or the active layer. The sole reason for the improved device performance is the reduced density of pinholes, leading to increased device Rsh.

Despite the fact that the problem of low Rsh in the device based on PM6/IT-4Cl can be solved using the solvent additive CN, VOC is still limited due to high voltage losses associated with undesirable CT state electronic properties, namely, too-large ΔECT. The electronic properties of the CT states are related to the structural properties of the donor and the acceptor molecules, as well as the structural properties of the donor–acceptor molecular interfaces in the blend active layer. When donor and acceptor molecules are packed too close together or too far apart, the electronic properties of the CT state could deteriorate, leading to an undesired ECT and ΔECT, limiting the device VOC. To optimize the electronic properties of the CT state in the blend of PM6/IT-4Cl and improve the indoor photovoltaic performance of the PM6/IT-4Cl device, we must improve the donor–acceptor interfacial packing property. To do this, we introduced BDD, a building block for PM6, as a solid additive in the construction of the PM6/IT-4Cl device. The chemical structure of BDD is shown in Fig. 4a. Because BDD has the same molecular structure as the donor moiety of PM6, close packing between BDD and PM6 is expected in the ternary blend of PM6/BDD/IT-4Cl. Thus, the incorporation of BDD in the PM6/IT-4Cl blend will most likely have a significant impact on the packing structure of PM6/IT-4Cl interfaces, and the extent of the impact is possible to control by adjusting the BDD content.

Indeed, the performance of the ternary photovoltaic device based on PM6/BDD/IT-4Cl can be tuned by varying the BDD content (defined as the weight ratio between BDD and PM6). The PCE of the ternary device increases at first, but then decreases with the increasing BDD content, as listed in Table 2. This is primarily due to the FF, which increases initially with the BDD content but then decreases. However, VOC consistently increases with the BDD content up to 30%: under a strong LED illumination intensity of 40000 lux, VOC of the ternary device with 30% BDD content is 0.94 V. Even under a reduced illumination intensity of 400 lux, VOC can still be maintained at 0.81 V. In comparison, VOC values for the binary device without BDD are 0.82 V under the illumination intensity of 40000 lux and 0.68 V under 400 lux. The J–V curves of the devices with different BDD content are given in Fig. S5 (ESI).

From the J–V measurements, we conclude that the use of BDD as a third component can indeed improve the electronic properties of the CT state in the PM6/IT-4Cl active layer. However, when the BDD content is too high, the transport properties of charge carriers deteriorate, limiting the performance of the PM6/BDD/IT-4Cl device. At the optimal BDD content of 20%, the best performance is achieved, with PCE values of 21.4% and 17.4% (Table 2) under illumination intensities of 4000 and 400 lux, respectively.
To better understand the origin of the impact of BDD on VOC of the PM6/BDD/IT-4Cl device, we determined the ECT value for the ternary device with the optimal BDD content of 20% from the sensitive EQE and EL spectrum, as shown in Fig. 4b: the incorporation of BDD raises the ECT value from 1.44 to 1.47 eV, implying that BDD influenced the packing structure of PM6/IT-4Cl interfaces. On the other hand, the use of BDD hardly affects the Eg (Fig. S6, ESI). Thus, the ΔECT value is reduced from 0.16 to 0.13 eV, resulting in reduced ΔVr, and is the reason behind the increased VOC.
Then, we measured EQEEL of the devices based on PM6/BDD/IT-4Cl, and found that the use of BDD also affected the EQEEL, and thus, the ΔVnr of the device. As shown in Fig. 4c, the addition of 20% BDD leads to the increase of EQEEL from about 10−6 to 10−5, corresponding to a decrease in ΔVnr from 0.32 to 0.27 V. This is another reason for the increased VOC. It was also noted that for the binary device-based PM6/IT-4Cl, EQEEL quickly reduced on reducing the injection current. This indicates that ΔVnr increases with decreasing illumination intensity, a characteristic of OPV devices with a high density of traps. On the other hand, for the ternary device, EQEEL is almost independent of the injection current. Thus, ΔVnr is low in the ternary device, regardless of the illumination intensity, suggesting that the density of traps is reduced by the use of BDD, and is the main reason for the increased EQEEL. Because of the suppression of the trap-assisted recombination, a higher degree of increase in the VOC of the device by the use of BDD is found for weaker illumination intensities (Table 2). This is the added benefit of using BDD as a solid additive for the PM6/IT-4Cl active layer.
Finally, to confirm that the increased EQEEL does originate from the reduced density of traps, we measured VOC as of function of illumination intensity for the ternary device. The results are shown in Fig. 5a. From a linear fit, we discovered that the ideality factor is 1.16 for the ternary device with BDD used as a solid additive, which is considerably lower than that of the binary device (1.40), suggesting that the density of trap states is indeed reduced. From the J–V curve of the single carrier device with the active layers based on PM6/BDD/IT-4Cl (Fig. 5b), we determined the density of traps in the ternary active layer, which is about 2.2 × 1018 cm−3, which is only a quarter of that in the binary device (8.2 × 1018 cm−3, Fig. 2f).

To conclude, in this work, we used the green solvent processed PM6/IT-4Cl material system as a model system to investigate the performance limit in OPV devices suitable for indoor applications. We demonstrated that (1) pinhole defects in the active layer led to a significant shunt current in the device, which is the main reason for the limited VOC and FF of the indoor devices, (2) an undesired CT driving force gave rise to too-high radiative voltage losses in indoor OPV devices, further limiting the device VOC, and (3) the density of traps in the active layers was high, detrimental to the performance of the devices under weak illumination intensities. We stressed that pinholes, large CT driving force, and traps could also exist in organic donor–acceptor active layers designed for harvesting sunlight, but they have limited impact on the overall performance of outdoor OPV devices. Therefore, these problems, specific to indoor OPV devices, have not received much attention in the OPV field.

To address these problems, we developed a tailor designed active layer processing strategy, based on the use of a solvent and a solid additive. Then, we realized the reduced density of pinholes, more desired CT driving force, and reduced density of traps in the PM6/IT-4Cl active layer. As a result, we managed to achieve a significant increase in open-circuit voltage by about 0.1 V, and an increase in PCE from 16% to 23%. Since the high voltage loss is the bottleneck problem for indoor OPV devices, the identification of the key issues limiting the photovoltage of the PM6/IT-4Cl devices, and the development of the solvent and solid additive strategy to address the issues are anticipated to play a critical role in further improving the performance of indoor light harvesting organic photovoltaic materials and devices.

Organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag. The devices were fabricated on pre-patterned ITO substrates cleaned in an ultrasonic sonicator, using detergent, and by TL-1 treatment (hydrogen peroxide/ultrapure water with a volume ratio of 1:1:5). After cleaning treatment, a hole-transporting layer of PEDOT:PSS was deposited by spin-coating (WS-650Mz-23NPPB, Laurell) at 5000 rpm for 50 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 20 min on a hotplate (IKA RCT digital). The thickness of PEDOT:PSS layers was about 40 nm. PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Active layer solutions were prepared by dissolving the donor and the acceptor materials in o-xylene with or without CN (0.5 vol%). The donor–acceptor weight ratio for PM6/IT-4Cl was 1:1, and the weight ratio for PM6/BDD/IT-4Cl systems was 1:0.1 (or 0.2, 0.3):1. The total concentration of the solutions based on PM6/IT-4Cl and PM6/BDD/IT-4CL was 16, 18, and 21 mg mL−1. The active layer solutions were heated at 75 °C and stirred at a speed of 1000 rpm on a magnetic stirring hotplate (IKA RCT digital) for 5 hours, prior to use. The solutions were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layers at a speed of 3000 rpm by a spin coater in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The thicknesses of active layers were about 80, 110, and 140 nm, respectively. The solvent for the PFN-Br solution was methanol, and the concentration of the solution was 0.5 mg mL−1. The solution was spin-coated at a speed of 3000 rpm onto the active layer. The thickness of the PFN-Br layer was 1 nm. Then, the samples were transferred into a thermal evaporator (MBRAUN), where a 100 nm Ag layer was evaporated onto the samples, under a vacuum pressure of 10−6 mbar, using a shadow mask. The active area of the devices was 0.04 cm2.

J–V curves of the organic photovoltaic devices were determined by illuminating the devices with a solar simulator (Newport Oriel VeraSol-2™ Class AAA) with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell and a set of optical filters. Indoor photovoltaic performance was determined using a 3000 K LED lamp, calibrated by a spectrometer (KYMERA-328I-B2, coupled with a CCD camera, DU970P-BVF, Andor), with the spectral irradiance varied by using neutral density filters.
Sensitive EQE spectra were measured using monochromatic light from a halogen lamp light source (LSH-75, Newport) and a monochromator (CS260-RG-3-MC-A, Newport). A series of long-pass optical filters (600 nm, 900 nm, 1100 nm) were employed to eliminate the overtone wavelengths from the monochromator. The monochromatic light was chopped at a frequency of 173 Hz by an optical chopper (3502 Optical Chopper, Newport). A front-end current amplifier (SR570, Stanford Instrument) and a phase-locked amplifier (SR830, Stanford Instrument) were used to record the current signal from the OPV devices. A Si detector (Hamamatsu s1337-1010BR) was used to calibrate the lamp intensity. The illuminated area was about 0.5 mm2.
EQEEL of the OPV devices was determined using a measurement system consisting of a Keithley 2400 digital source meter to inject electric current into the OPV devices, and a Keithley 6482 picoammeter to measure the electric current from a Si photodiode, used to collect the photons emitted by the OPV devices.
EL spectra of the OPV devices were recorded using a fluorescence spectrometer (KYMERA-328I-B2, Andor Technologies Ltd) and a Si EMCCD detector (DU970P-BVF, Andor), for detecting light signals in the wavelength range of 400–1000 nm, and an InGaAs detector (DU491A-1.7, Andor) for detecting optical signals in the wavelength range of 900–1600 nm. A Keithley 2400 instrument was used as a power supply to inject electric current into the OPV devices. The optical signals from the devices were collected using an optical fiber, connected to the spectrometer. For PL measurement, a laser with an emission wavelength of 550 nm was used to excite the samples.
Atomic force microscopy images were measured using an MFP-3D-BIO™ instrument, Asylum Research, in a tapping-mode.
Absorption spectra of the thin films were measured using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer).
Reflection microscope images of the thin films were recorded using a LV100NPOL/Ci-POL (Nikon).
The thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS and the active layers were determined using a Tencor P-7 Stylus Profiler (KLA).
