Substituting olefinic for acetylenic π-spacers in anthracene-based conjugated semiconductor donors leads to appreciable increases in the power conversion efficiencies of the resulting bulk heterojunction solar cells.

Developing π-conjugated organic materials for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has attracted considerable interest over the last few years. In bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs, photoabsorption creates bound electron–holes pairs (excitons), a fraction of which undergo scission to form charge carriers for ultimate collection at the device electrodes. Exciton dissociation occurs most efficiently at the interface between the two key materials of the device active layer, electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) species. Ideally, BHJ structures represent the case of a bicontinuous composite of donor and acceptor phases, thereby maximizing the all-important interfacial area between these two components.

The general structure of a BHJ solar cell is shown in Fig. 1A. The variants investigated here are fabricated on patterned ITO (indium tin oxide)-coated glass substrates, used as the bottom transparent anode. A thin semiconducting poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer is then spin-cast on the anode, both to improve the surface quality of the ITO and to facilitate hole-extraction/electron-blocking. Next, the active BHJ layer is deposited by spin-coating, followed by sequential vacuum deposition of LiF and a low work function metallic cathode (e.g., aluminium). The device power conversion efficiency (PCE) is defined by eqn (1), where Voc is the open circuit voltage, Jsc is the short circuit current (mA cm−2), FF is the fill factor, and Po is the power of incident light source (mW cm−2).

One of the most widely investigated donor and acceptor materials combinations is a blend of a semiconducting donor
polymer and a fullerene derivative as the acceptor. PCEs up to ∼5% have been achieved for BHJ cells fabricated from a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Fig. 1B) phase-separated blend. Recently, increasing attention has focused on soluble small molecules as donors, since they offer the facile processing associated with polymers, but are monodisperse, are generally easier to purify, and usually exhibit higher charge carrier mobilities. To date, the maximum PCE of a solution processable BHJ device based on a small molecule donor is 1.33%.

Conjugated acene molecules have been shown to exhibit large field-effect mobilities, which may be accompanied by relatively large exciton diffusion lengths, desirable in BHJ solar cells. We report here the synthesis and characterization of new anthracene-based derivatives 1–4 and their implementation as donors in BHJ solar cells having PCEs up to ∼1.2% under the standard AM1.5G conditions. Each donor system was designed to achieve both high solubility in common organic solvents and an extension of the absorption spectra toward low energies to capture greater amounts of solar spectrum. Importantly, the comparative study of compounds 1–4 allows understanding of the effects of the replacement of the acetylenic for the olefinic π-spacer on the chromophore electronic structure, physical properties, and device efficiencies.
The synthesis of donors 1–3 was carried out by means of Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions of 9,10-dibromoanthracene, while 4 was synthesized according to a published procedure. Olefinic and acetylenic spacers were introduced viaHeck and Sonogashira reactions, respectively. Heck coupling of 9,10-dibromoanthracene with 3,4-(bishexyloxy)-styrene5 affords 1, having the C–C double bond (Scheme 1). The synthesis of compound 2 begins with Heck coupling between 4-bromobenzaldehyde and 3,4-(bishexyloxy)-styrene. The resulting aldehyde6 is reacted with methyltriphenyl-phosphonium bromide under Wittig conditions to afford E-stilbene-like intermediate 7, which is subjected to additional Heck coupling with 9,10-dibromoanthracene to provide the target product in a good overall yield (44%, Scheme 1).

Sonogashira coupling of 4-(iodophenylethynyl)trimethyl-silane with 3,4-(bishexyloxy)-ethynylbenzene (8) and subsequent deprotection of TMS-protected derivative 9 affords intermediate 10, which is then converted into acetylenic compound 3 by reaction with 9,10-dibromoanthracene (Scheme 2). All of the new compounds were characterized by conventional chemical and analytical methods (ESI ).
The frontier MO energies of compounds 1–4 were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV, see Fig. S1 and S2 in ESI and Table 1). These data show that the HOMO energies of compounds 1–4 are within the required range (−5.01 to −5.51 eV) to ensure an acceptable Voc in a PCBM BHJ device (vide infra). The LUMO energy levels for olefinic compounds 1 and 2 are higher than those determined for the acetylenic analogues 3 and 4, a result of the more electron-withdrawing character of the triple bond. The thermal stability of the present donors was also of interest as an important enabling parameter for BHJ device processing and durability. TGA analyses show that all of these compounds are thermally very stable, with onset decomposition temperatures ranging from 270 to 316 °C (see Fig. S3 in ESI and Table 1).

The OPV active layers fabricated in this study consisted of a blend of one of compounds 1–4 as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor. An optimum D : A ratio of 1 : 1 (wt/wt) was determined after trials using different donor–acceptor ratios. The active layer films were spin-coated from dry chloroform solutions (chloroform was found to be the optimum solvent). All devices were characterized under the standard AM1.5G 1 Sun test conditions using the NREL-calibrated instrumentation described previously. Device fabrication and characterization details are given in the ESI .
The optical absorption spectra of 3/PCBM and 4/PCBM films (see ESI , Fig. S4) are significantly broader than those for blended films containing the corresponding olefinic donors (1/PCBM and 2/PCBM). The solid state optical spectra of pristine compounds 1–4 as thin films (Table 1) exhibit bathochromic shifts versus the corresponding solution spectra. The red-shift suggests a greater π–π structural organization in the solid state. Initial OPV optimization studies revealed that PCE values increase with decreasing active layer film thickness. Active layer thermal annealing over the range 50–120 °C, and for different times, invariably resulted in extensive, visible film degradation, adversely affecting device performance. Such effects are not uncommon.
OPV current density–voltage (J–V) curves under illumination for the present devices based on chromophores1–4 are shown in Fig. 1A. Under the dark conditions (Fig. 1B), all the J–V curves reveal rectifying diode characteristics, especially for devices based on acetylenic derivative 3, with a rectification ratio of ∼102 at 1.5 V. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) values for devices fabricated with compounds 1 and 2 are lower than those for donors 3 and 4, and interestingly, track the progression in the HOMO energies, which are ∼0.2 eV higher for olefinic donors. The short circuit currents (Jsc) measured for devices based on olefinic donors 1 and 2 are low, affording a poor PCE, especially for 1/PCBM (i.e., 0.04%). This reveals a correlation with the much higher LUMO energies present in 1 and 2versus3 and 4 (Table 2). On the other hand, the devices fabricated with acetylenic donors 3 and 4 exhibit short-circuit current densities of 2.63 and 2.62 mA cm−2, respectively, and substantial open circuit voltages of 0.93 and 0.96 V, respectively. Combined with fill factors (FF) of 41% and 45%, these data yield PCEs of 1.02 and 1.17%, respectively (Table 2).

Spectral response data for 1–4/PCBM based OPV devices are shown in Fig. 2C. The EQE maximum for 2/PCBM film is ∼7% at 417 nm, which is more than twice that of 1/PCBM films (∼3% at 460 nm). It has been reported that higher EQE values indicate more efficient charge creation, separation, and transport processes within the donor/PCBM blend films. This may explain the Jsc values of the devices based on olefinic donor 2, which are about 4× greater than that obtained for the corresponding devices with compound 1. The spectral response of the 3/PCBM and 4/PCBM based OPVs reveals an appreciable EQE response in the 400–500 nm wavelength range. Devices with 3/PCBM exhibit EQE ∼27% at 430 nm; for the 4/PCBM blend, the EQE is slightly lower, with a maximum of ∼26% at 450 nm. This is in agreement with the aforementioned broadening of the optical spectra for the 3/PCBM and 4/PCBM blends versus those for 1/PCBM and 2/PCBM.
It is known that OPV efficiencies are greatly influenced by active layer thin film morphologies. We investigated the morphological differences in the present anthracene derivative/PCBM blend films by AFM (see Fig. S5 in ESI ). Films of 1/PCBM and 3/PCBM exhibit very similar rms roughness, σ, 1.09 nm and 1.12 nm, respectively, however, 3/PCBM films are significantly thinner. For 2/PCBM films, a very smooth surface is observed, with σ ∼ 0.55 nm. Finally, the 4/PCBM AFM image reveals a rough active layer, with σ ∼ 4.95 nm. However, since the morphological variations here are not extreme, we ascribe the observed PCE difference within this donor series to variations on electronic structure, principally the HOMO–LUMO energies.
In conclusion, soluble anthracene-core donor molecules containing olefinic or acetylenic spacers were synthesized in good yields and characterized in terms of electronic structure and film-forming properties. BHJ solar cells based on the acetylenic donors are found to be significantly more efficient than those based on the olefinic donors, thus underscoring the potential of acetylenic π-donors in organic photovoltaics. To the best of our knowledge, the PCEs of the devices based on the present acetylenic donors rival or exceed those of the most efficient small-molecule BHJs reported to date. Further work is under way to tune donor optical and electronic properties by structural modifications and processing, and to optimize the OPV performance of these materials.
